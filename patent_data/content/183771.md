## Description
The present invention is related to the invention described in EP A 0181379 The present invention relates generally to the field of reference pulse processing circuitry in which a reference pulse corresponding to the occurrence of a predetermined rotational position of a rotating shaft is received by a circuit and further processed. More particularly, the present invention is related to such a reference pulse circuit which is adaptable for control of an internal combustion engine. In prior engine control systems it is known to sense the rotation of the engine crankshaft by sensing the passage of projections teeth present on a wheel rotated by the engine crankshaft. Typically, a large number of teeth are provided on the rotating wheel to provide crankshaft angular rotation resolution with the spacing between each tooth representative of a predetermined number of degrees of revolution of the engine crankshaft. These large number of teeth provide a means of monitoring the relative rotation of the engine crankshaft, but typically they do not provide information identifying one predetermined reference position of the crankshaft as opposed to other rotational positions. In some systems it is necessary to provide an indication of a reference position of the rotated wheel which is representative of a single reference rotational position of the engine crankshaft which occurs once for each crankshaft revolution. This reference position pulse is typically utilized to initiate proper sequential engine control and distinguish which one of the engine cyclinders should be receiving fuel and spark ignition at any particular time, whereas the large number of projecting teeth are utilized in determining the amount of fuel to be injected and the precise timing of the fuel injection and occurrence of spark in each engine cyclinder. Such systems are well known and include distributorless ignition systems and fuel injection systems such as those shown in U.S. patents 4,104,997, 4,338,813 and 4,338,903, all assigned to the assignee of the present invention. Some prior engine control systems utilize one sensor to sense the passage of a large number of closely spaced teeth to provide precise resolution of engine rotation, while an additional separate sensor or the same sensor is utilized to sense either a specially shaped tooth or an extra one of the rotated teeth, a separate reference tooth rotated synchronously with the engine crankshaft. There are also a number of systems in which the engine crankshaft reference position is indicated by the occurrence of the absence of one of a large number of teeth on a rotating wheel wherein the remaining teeth provide pulses for the accurate angular resolution of engine crankshaft rotation. In all of the prior systems, regardless of whether a specially shaped tooth, the absence of a tooth, or a separate sensor is utilized to sense a separate reference position projection, the occurrence of an erroneous reference position pulse is possible. The occurrence of a false reference pulse is actually quite likely in single sensor pulse detection systems during transient engine conditions such as abrupt engine acceleration and or deceleration. While some engine control systems ignore pulse detections if they occur during certain conditions, such as dwell or spark, they do not insure the correctness of pulse detections at other times, and they do not insure that only true reference position pulses result in the implementation of engine control. If engine control is implemented in accordance with an erroneous reference position pulse, this can readily result in injecting fuel or initiating spark in an engine cyclinder at the wrong cycle time with the result being at least improper engine performance and possibly permanent engine damage. Document EP A 0020070 describes a circuit for recognising cyclically occurring pulse sequences for engine control. The circuit comprises means for producing reference pulses corresponding to the occurrence of predetermined reference rotational positions of a rotating shaft, means for producing a pulse train comprising a plurality of pulse trained pulses which occur between the occurrence of said reference rotational positions of said shaft, and means for receiving both said reference pulses and said pulse train pulses. The circuit does not verify the correctness of the occurrence of the reference pulses, which in this prior art document are created in response to detecting the occurrence of a missing pulse in the pulse train pulses. An object of the present invention is to provide a reference pulse verification circuit which overcomes the above mentioned deficiencies of the prior systems. According to the present invention, the means for receiving both the reference pulses and the pulse train pulses includes circuitry for verifying the correctness of the occurrence of the said reference pulses by providing a verified reference pulse in response to each reference pulse which occurs at substantially a predetermined number of pulse train pulses after the occurrence of a preceding reference pulse, whereby spurious reference pulses can be differentiated from true reference pulses. In this way, the invention provides a reference pulse verification circuit adaptable for use in an engine control system in which engine control is implemented in response to verified reference position pulses which are distinguished from unverified reference position pulses by noting the existence of a predetermined plurality of crankshaft rotational position pulses between the occurrence of each reference position pulse. Basically, the preferred embodiment of the present invention utilizes a single sensor which senses projecting teeth on a rotating wheel rotated by an engine crankshaft. In response to the absence of one of the rotating teeth, the sensor, in combination with a missing pulse detector, provides a reference pulse signal. A verification counter effectively counts each one of the teeth sensed by the senor and counts from zero up to a maximum predetermined count which represents the number of teeth which normally occur between sequential reference positions corresponding to the occurrence of the missing tooth position on the rotating wheel. The counter is reset in response to either the occurrence of this maximum count and or the occurrence of any missing tooth detection signal. Whenever the maximum count of the verification counter corresponds to the occurrence of a missing tooth detection, then a verified reference position pulse is provided in response thereto, and the verified pulse is effectively provided to an engine control circuit which controls various functions such as spark dwell and or fuel injection. Preferably, the engine control circuit is enabled, after initial power is applied thereto, in response to the reception of the first verified reference position pulse. By verifying the correctness of the occurrence of the reference position pulse, the present invention avoids having the engine control circuit respond to improper reference position pulses thereby minimizing the possibility of improper engine control due to the attempted implementation of spark or fuel injection operations in the wrong cylinder and or at the wrong time. The present invention is most advantageously utilized when a single sensor is used to provide both the sequence initiating reference position pulses as well as the accurate high resolution crankshaft position pulses, since in such cases the possibility of providing an erroneous reference position pulse is likely during engine transient conditions such as abrupt acceleration or deceleration. By resetting the verification counter after each reference pulse detection, regardless whether it is a correct or improper reference pulse detection, verified reference pulses will only occur when a known predetermined count is obtained between two sequential reference pulse detections. The resetting of the count of the counter in response to the occurrence of the predetermined maximum count representative of the number of teeth between two proper reference pulse detections, is an additional safety feature of the present invention and prevents the counter from continuing to count past the maximum predetermined count. For a more complete understanding of the invention reference should be made to the drawings, in which Figure 1 illustrates an engine control system 10 which includes a wheel 11 having 35 outwardly projecting peripheral teeth 12 uniformaly spaced around the wheel 11 at 10 degree angular increments and including a missing tooth location 13. The wheel 11 is rotated about a central axis 14 corresponding to an engine crankshaft. The space between each of the teeth 12 represents a ten degree increment of angular rotation of the engine crankshaft with the missing tooth location 13 corresponding to a predetermined engine cylinder reference position of the engine crankshaft. While preferably the teeth 12 are uniformly spaced, this is not necessary for proper operation of the present invention. A fixed sensor 15 is positioned adjacent to the wheel 11 and has an active sensor area 16 which senses the passage of the teeth 12 and provides, in response thereto, a corresponding pulse train signal at an output terminal A. The terminal A is provided as an input to a buffer, sync and pulse shaper circuit 17 which essentially processes the signal at the terminal A to provide an appropriately delayed and squared up pulse train signal at an output terminal B. The pulse train signal at the terminal B is provided as an input to both a missing pulse detector 18 and an engine control circuit 19 wherein the engine control circuit implements such functions as controlling engine spark dwell and engine fuel injection by providing control signals at an output terminal 20 which is representative of control terminals for engine cylinder spark plugs and or fuel injectors. Such engine control circuits are well known and do not form an essential part of the present invention since they merely respond to crankshaft position pulses to provide the timing signals for implementing various engine controls which control the rotation of the engine crankshaft in accordance with predetermined relationships. The signal at terminal B is used by circuit 19 to determine the magnitude and timing of the engine control signals provided at terminal 20, while the circuit 19 responds to reference pulses at terminal F to effectively implement the proper sequence of control signals at terminal 20 to the proper engine cylinder apparatus. The missing pulse detector 18 responds to the pulse train signal at the terminal B and provides a missing pulse detection output signal at an output terminal C in response to the passage of the missing tooth location 13 past the active sensing area 16. Thus the signal at the terminal C represents an unverified reference position pulse corresponding to a predetermined rotational position of the engine crankshaft corresponding to the missing tooth location 13 on the wheel 11. The missing pulse detector 18 can comprise any well known missing pulse detector configuration, such as, for example, the configurations discussed in U.S. Patents 4,152,655, 4,311,962 or 4,345,209. Preferably the missing pulse detector corresponds in general to the apparatus disclosed in the above referred to copending U.S. patent application. It should be noted that while a missing pulse detector 18 is utilized in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the present invention is also usable with any type of reference position pulse detector apparatus which provides at the terminal C an indication of the occurrence of a predetermined rotational position of the engine crankshaft. Thus other reference detectors and apparatus which respond to either split or otherwise unusually shaped teeth are also contemplated by the present invention, as well as the utilization of an additional sensor, separate from the sensor 15, that responds to a separate projection on the rotating wheel 11 to provide a reference detection pulse at the terminal C. The pulse train pulses at the terminal B and the reference position pulse signal at the terminal C are both provided as inputs to a reference pulse verification circuit 21 shown dashed in Figure 1. The verification circuit 21 comprises a pulse train pulse counter 22 which has a clock input terminal c directly connected to the terminal B. The counter 22 serves as a verification counter that effectively directly counts the number of teeth on the rotating wheel 11 by counting the number of pulses produced by the sensor 15 in response to the passage of each of the teeth 12. Thus counter 22 can be considered a direct tooth counter since it is incremented one count for each tooth which passes the sensor 15. Three count output terminals Q1, Q2 and Q6 of the counter 22 are connected as inputs to an AND gate 23 which provides an output at a terminal E. The terminal E is connected as an input to a reset logic and delay circuit 24 which also receives an input via a direct connection to the terminal C and provides an output signal that is connected to a reset terminal R of the counter 22. The terminal E is connected as an input to an AND gate 25 which receives an additional input via a direct connection to the terminal C and provides an output at a terminal F that is connected as a sequence initiating input to the engine control circuit 19. The terminal F is also connected to a set terminal S of a flip flop circuit 26 which has its output terminal Q connected to a terminal G that is connected to an enable terminal of the engine control circuit 19. A reset terminal The operation of the engine control system 10 shown in Figure 1 will now be discussed in conjunction with the signal waveforms illustrated in Figure 2. In Figure 2 signal waveform graphs A through G represent the electrical signals produced at the terminals A through G illustrated in Figure 1. All the graphs A G are drawn with the same horizontal axis time scale with the vertical axes representative of amplitude. The graph D in Figure 2 represents the stepped count of the counter 22. The signal waveforms shown in the other graphs in Figure 2 are representative of signal waveforms produced by the embodiment shown in Figures 3 and 4 of the present invention, and therefore these signals will be discussed later in conjunction with that embodiment. Essentially, the wheel 11 is rotated by the engine crankshaft such that the 35 teeth 12 pass in proximity to the active sensing area 16 and produce in response thereto a series of tooth pulses which comprise a pulse train signal 40 at terminal A as shown in Figure 2. At an initial time t The buffer, sync and pulse shaper circuit 17 responds to the signal 40 at terminal A by providing in response thereto a signal 41 comprising short duration pulses synchronized to a high frequency reference oscillator. Such synchronization can be accomplished by many known techniques and is done to assist in implementing short duration known signal delays when they are needed. The times at which the pulses of the signal 41 occur substantially corresponds to the tines t₁ through t₃₅ in graph A and are so shown in graph B. The circuit 17 may also be used to square up the signals at the terminal A and also to delay them, if appropriate, by small finite amounts when this is desired. This will be further discussed in conjunction with the embodiment shown in Figures 3 and 4. Thus in response to the signal 40 at the terminal A, an equivalent tooth pulse train signal 41 is provided at the terminal B. The signal 41 is provided as a timing input to the engine control circuit 19 and also as an input to the missing pulse detector 18. The missing pulse detector 18 comprises circuitry which is able to distinguish between the repetitive occurrence of the pulses corresponding to the teeth 12 and the absence of one of these pulses corresponding to the occurrence of the missing tooth location 13. In response to the missing pulse location 13 the detector 18 provides a missing tooth detection signal 42. This is illustrated in Figure 2 graph C as comprising a reference detection pulse commencing substantially at the time t₅ and terminating prior to the time t₆. It should be noted that preferably the present invention contemplates detecting the occurrence of the missing pulse at the time t₃ by providing a detection signal pulse substantially at the time t₅. However, even if missing pulse detectors are utilized which provide for an earlier detection of the missing pulse, the present invention still can be utilized. As was previously noted, the circuitry within the missing pulse detector 18 can be of any conventional design wherein many types of circuit configurations are known for such missing pulse detectors. The use of missing pulse detectors in engine control systems generally saves the expense of an additional sensor to provide a reference pulse. However, as was previously noted, such missing pulse detectors are subject to providing erroneous pulse detection outputs during abrupt engine transient conditions such as acceleration and or deceleration. The present invention provides therefore for verifying the accuracy of the output of the missing pulse detector 18 and insuring that only verified missing pulse detections are allowed to determine the operation of the engine control circuit 19. The present invention can also be used to verify the correctness of any reference pulse detection apparatus wherein a known plurality of timing tooth pulses occur between reference pulses. The counter 22 is incremented in response to each tooth pulse provided at the terminal B. This is indicated by the staircase step waveform 43 shown in Figure 2 graph D. It is assumed that at the start time of t The reset logic and delay circuit 24 responds to either the providing of a high missing pulse detection signal 42 at the terminal C or the attainment of a maximum count of the counter 22 indicated by the high logic signal 44 at the terminal E by, in response to either and or both of these outputs, producing a reset of the counter 22 to a zero count. By resetting the counter 22 in response to each reference pulse detection provided by the missing pulse detector 18, this insures that if the detector 18 provides a missing pulse detection signal at other than the proper time, a maximum count of the counter 22 will not occur coincident with the next missing pulse detection provided by the detector 18, and therefore no verified reference pulse will be provided. This, therefore, insures that verified reference pulses are provided by the present invention only when a total of 35 tooth pulses are counted by the counter 22 between the occurrence of two sequential missing pulse detection signals provided by the detector 18. By resetting the counter 22 after the attainment of each maximum count, this prevents the counter 22 from continuing to upcount wherein this continued upcounting might result in the next missing pulse detection provided by the detector 18 as coinciding with a count of 35 of the counter 22 since all counters are cyclic in nature and therefore will continue to count in cyclic fashion unless they are reset. It should be noted that the reset and logic delay circuit 24, besides effectively OR ing the signals at the terminals E and C to provide a reset signal to the counter 22, also provides an appropriate delay function to these signals such that this resetting will occur after the attainment of a count of 35 causing a high pulse in signal 44 at the terminal E and or after the occurrence of a proper missing pulse detection at the terminal C. The components 26 through 33 in the Figure 1 embodiment illustrate that the present invention provides for enabling the engine control circuit 19 in response to the first verified missing pulse detection which occurs after the application of power to the engine control circuit 19. This can best be explained as follows. In response to the closure of switch 32, operative power is provided at the terminal B to at least both the engine control circuit 19 and the flip flop 26. At this time a low signal will still be provided at the terminal 27 due to the action of the capacitor 28. This low signal maintains the flip flop 26 Q output reset at a low output state until the capacitor 28 charges up, at which time the flip flop 26 can be set. A low state at the terminal G, which is directly connected to the flip flop Q terminal, does not permit the enablement of the engine control circuit 19. This enablement function can be readily implemented by merely blocking the production of any control voltages at the output 20 by the engine control circuit until a high logic signal is provided at the enablement terminal of the circuit 19. As the capacitor 28 charges up, a high signal is provided at terminal 27 which will therefore allow the flip flop 26 to be set. The signal at terminal 27 can be considered a power up transient signal. In response to the first verified missing pulse detection signal provided at a terminal F, the flip flop 26 is set to a high state as shown in Figure 2, graph G which thereby enables the engine control circuit 19 to provide suitable control signals at the output terminal 20. This represents an additional safety feature of the present invention wherein prior to the production of the first verified missing pulse detection signal the engine control circuit will not be effectively enabled. This is typically desirable since until the engine control circuit has received a correct reference position signal, it will not know which engine cylinder is to be provided with fuel injection and or which cylinder is to receive a spark voltage. Thus the present invention has provided for enabling the engine control circuit 19 in response to the occurrence of the first verified reference pulse detection after the power up transient signal provided at the terminal 27 which resulted in maintaining the flip flop 26 reset until some time after the initial application of power to the control circuit 19. The operation of the embodiment of the present invention illustrated in Figures 3 and 4 will now be discussed with respect to how those embodiments implement all of the functions attributed to the embodiment depicted in Figure 1. It should be noted that identical reference numbers and letters have been utilized in in Figures 3 and 4 to identify corresponding identical components and terminals shown in Figure 1. In Figure 3, the buffer, sync and pulse shaper circuit 17 is shown as comprising a very high frequency clock 50 which provides a constant frequency one megahertz output signal 51 at a terminal H which is provided as an input to a pulse shaper and sync delay circuit 52 that also receives, as an input, the signal 40 at the terminal A. The circuit 52 essentially provides three synchronized but slightly delayed output pulse signals 53, 54 and 55 at terminals J, K, and L, respectively, in response to each tooth pulse provided as part of the signal 40. This is illustrated in the Figure 2 waveforms H through L which depict the signals present at the terminals identified by the same letters wherein the signal 40 at the terminal A is represented by the waveform shown in Figure 2 graph I. It should be noted that the horizontal time axis scale for the signals shown in graphs H through T in Figure 2 is identical, and this scale is greatly expanded with respect to the scale for graphs A G as can be seen by noting the duration of the two pulses shown in graph I. It should be noted that the first tooth pulse shown in the graph I is the second t₅ pulse shown in graph A which is provided for after two proper missing pulse detections. Essentialy the circuit 52, which is shown in substantially more detail in Figure 4, synchronizes tooth pulses of the signal 40 to the high frequency clock signal 51 provided at the terminal H. Thus the synchronized signal 53 provided at the terminal J comprises a pulse which starts at the next clock pulse positive transition which occurs after the time t₅, and this pulse at the terminal J terminates at the next subsequent positive clock pulse transition. Similiarly, the signal 54 at the terminal K is identical to the signal at the terminal J, but delayed by one clock pulse period, and a similar statement applies to the signal 55 at the terminal L being delayed with respect to the signal 54 at the terminal K by one clock pulse period. In this manner three short duration slightly delayed pulses are provided for each tooth pulse created by the sensor 15 and the delay periods between these pulses can be utilized to insure the proper resetting of the verification counter 22. The terminal J in Figure 3 is connected as an input to the clock terminal of the counter 22 thus resulting in the clock 22 being incremented in synchronism with the high frequency clock signal 51 provided by the clock 50 and being incremented ahead of the occurrence of pulses on the corresponding but delayed and synchronized signals 54 and 55. The signal 53 is also provided as an input to the missing tooth detector 18 which preferably responds to this signal to provide a missing tooth reference pulse detection after the occurrence of the missing tooth position 13 and, preferably, after the occurrence of one additional tooth pulse and substantially coincident with the occurrence of the next additional tooth pulse at t₅. It should be noted that the configuration shown in Figure 4 for the pulse shaper and synchronizing delay circuit 52 is merely a typical configuration for a circuit which receives the signal 40 at the terminal A and provides synchronized but delayed output pulses in response thereto at the terminals J, K, and L as shown in the graphs J, K, and L in Figure 2. In Figure 3, three output states Q1, Q2 and Q6 of the counter 22 are connected as inputs to a NAND gate 56 which also receives an inverted clock pulse signal input from the terminal H via an inverter stage 57. The logic provided by just the ANDing of the counter 22 states Q1, Q2 and Q6 is shown in graph M, and the output of the NAND gate 56 is provided at a terminal 58 and is shown in graph N and actually represents the inverted signal at the terminal E. The terminal 58 is connected as an input to a NOR gate 59 which receives an additional input shown in graph O from the terminal C via an inverter gate 60 and provides as its output the signal at the terminal F shown in graph T. The signal in graph O represents an inverted missing pulse detection signal, and is the inverse of the signal 42 shown in graph C. The output of the inverter 60 is also provided as input to a NAND gate 61 which also receives an input via a connection to the terminal 58 and provides an output shown in either graphs P1 or P2 as an input to a NAND gate 62. Graph P1 illustrates the output of gate 61 if a missing pulse has been detected, as it normally should be at the time t₅, and graph P2 shows the output of gate 61 if a missing pulse was not detected. It should be noted that in the first case the gate 61 output goes high because of a missing pulse detect whereas in the second case the gate 61 goes high because a counter maximum count was achieved. In any event, the end result will be the resetting of the counter due to gate 61 going high. In Figure 3 the terminal K is connected through an inverter 63 as an input to a NOR gate 64 which receives an additional input via a direct connection to the clock terminal H and provides an output shown in graph Q as an input to the NAND gate 62. The output of the NAND gate 62 is shown in graph R and is connected as an input to a NAND gate 65 which receives an additional input via a direct connection to the terminal 27 and provides a reset output shown in graph S directly to the reset terminal of the counter 22. The result of the connections of the elements 56 through 65 insures that the counter 22 will be reset after each 35 count attained by the counter 22 and or after each missing pulse detection output provided by the detector 18 wherein this resetting will be synchronized with the high frequency clock pulses 51 of the clock 50 while also providing at the terminal F a verified missing tooth reference pulse shown in graph T if the detector 18 provides a reference pulse output which coincides with the maximum count of 35 of the counter 22. In Figure 3 it should be noted that the flip flop 26 has now been illustrated as comprising a D type flip flop with the terminal F being connected to the clock terminal of the flip flop and the not set In summary a reference pulse verification circuit has been provided in which the occurrence of an engine crankshaft reference position pulse has been verified by providing a verified reference pulse only in response to the coincidence of a reference position pulse with a predetermined incremented count of a counter wherein it is known that between proper reference position pulse occurrences a predetermined number of tooth pulses will be provided to a counter for counting thereby. While I have shown and described specific embodients of this invention, further modifications and improvements will occur to those skilled in the art. Such modifications, as previously noted, could comprise the utilizing of other types of reference position detectors rather than the missing pulse detector 18 contemplated by the present invention. Such other types of detectors could utilize a sensor in addition to the sensor 15 and could function by sensing a projection in addition to the projecting teeth 12. However, as was previously noted, the present invention preferably will utilize only a single sensor and this provides a substantial advantage when the output of this single sensor is utilized not only to provide accurate angular resolution pulses for the engine crankshaft, but also to provide engine rotational reference position pulses for the proper sequencing of an engine control circuit. All such modifications which retain the basic underlying principles disclosed and claimed herein are within the scope of this invention.
