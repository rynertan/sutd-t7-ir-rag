# Flexible abrasive member and method of making same.

## Abstract
A flexible abrasive member is formed by applying a layer of metal 15,16 to mesh material 12 . Abrasive material 14 is embedded in the metal layer 15,16 during the deposition of the layer by an electrodeposition process. The mesh mater ial 12 may be electrically non conducting woven material and the metal layer 15,16 is deposited through the mesh material 12 . In making the member the mesh material 12 is laid on a smooth, preferably curvilinear, surface 10 formed with areas 11 for receiving the metal layer 15, 16 . Abrasive material 14 is introduced onto the surface at the beginning of the metal deposition process or towards the end of the deposition process.
