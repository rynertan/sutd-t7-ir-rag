## Description
The present invention concerns partially advanced epoxy resin compositions and products resulting from reacting and curing said compositions. Lee and Neville in While these cured products have good properties, application of the mixtures of epoxy resins and the curing agent are very difficult in that they are highly viscous, are difficult to devolatilize and at a temperature sufficiently high to achieve a suitable viscosity, the working time or pot life is relatively short. U S A 3,738,862 is directed to laminates prepared in situ by impregnating a glass cloth with a varnish comprising an epoxy resin containing an organic phosphine or a phosphonium halide, a phenol, a solvent, an epoxy curing agent and, optionally an accelerator. It is pointed out that the hot strength of the in situ laminates is superior to the hot strength of laminates prepared from conventional kettle epoxy resin binders. U S A 3,687,894 is directed to compositions for one step simultaneous advancement and B staging or curing of liquid epoxy resins. The methods involve forming a composition in a solvent system of the liquid epoxy resin, a hydroxyl containing material retractable therewith at elevated temperatures and a hardener therefore, applying the mixture to a suitable substrate and subjecting the composite to elevated temperatures.
