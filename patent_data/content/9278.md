# Improved disposable diaper having refastenable tape system.

## Abstract
An improved disposable diaper of the type having a relatively high elongation to tensile force property, an ab sorbent pad 60 , and tape tab fasteners 31, 32 coated with a peelable adhesive. The backsheet 21 is reinforced by coating the mother s bond region thereof with a mate rial having high tensile strength and a low elongation to tensile force property relative to the backsheet material. The coating may be continuous or patterned and may be disposed on either the outwardly facing surface or the in wardly facing surface of the mother s bond region of the backsheet. When applied to the inwardly facing surface, the coating material may be adhesive material and may se cure the backsheet to the pad assembly of the diaper. The reinforcement of the backsheet improves the resistance of the backsheet to stretching and tearing when subjected to tensile forces during fastening and wearing, and to peeling forces when the tape tab fasteners are being peeled open. Thus, the fasteners are refastenable.
