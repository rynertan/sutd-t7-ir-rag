# Elastomer compositions containing multi ring hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
Elastomer compositions useful, for example, as hot melt adhesives, are compositions containing certain normally solid, essentially organic elastomers and an elastomer modifying material comprising at least one compound consisting of at least 3 hydrocarbon rings including at least one aromatic ring and at least one saturated ring free to rotate independently of at least one aromatic ring in the molecule of said compound, said compound having a molecular weight between about 200 and about 2000.
