# Method for treatment of neuroectodermal malignancies and epithelial carcinomas in humans.

## Abstract
Major tumor regression with only mild side effects is observed by treatment of human melanoma patients with R24 mouse monoclonal antibody that identifies GD3 ganglioside on the surface of melanoma and other cells of neuroectodermal origin. R24 also serves to treat epithelial carcinomas as for example lung and or breast tumor. Metasteses of the various cancers can also be treated.

DESCRIPTION The examples shown serve to illustrate the invention without limiting it. In the present study, we show the response of melanoma patients to R24 with regard to different dose levels, toxicity, serological parameters and tumor response. This work is described in a publication Houghton,A.N., et al. 1984 Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. in press which is hereby incorporated by reference. Preparation and Administration of R4 R24 was prepared from ascites of BALB C x 57 Bl Pl mice, purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, chromatography over protein A Sepharose with pH 4.0 acetate buffer elution and further purification by G 25 Sephadex column with PBS pH 6.0 and filtered. Each R24 batch was 3 mg ml stored in 2 human serum albumin at 700C. Each batch was tested for antibody reactivity and assayed for nucleic acids, 16 mouse viruses, bacteria, fungi and mycoplasma.Preparations underwent standard safety testing in mice and guinea pigs and pyrogenicity testing in rabbits. R24 was administered by intravenous infusion in 100 200 ml 0.9 saline and 5 human serum albumin. Skin tests with 0.1 micro g R24 were done before the first treatment. The schedule of treatment was 1 mg M2 or 10 mg M2 every other day for eight treatments or 30 mg M2 per day by continuous in fusion on days 1 through 5 and 8 through 12. Serological Tests R24 antibody titers were determined by testing serum samples in protein A mixed adsorption assays PA assays Pfreundschuh, M., et al. 1978 Proc. Nat l. Acad.Sci., U.S.A. 75 5122 5126 against the melanoma target cell line SK MEL 28. R24 concentrations were measured by an enzyme linked immunoassay. Falcon 3034 plates FalconLabware, Oxnard, CA, U.S.A were precoated with purified R24 125 micrograms. Rabbit antimouse IgG3 Bionetics, Inc.,Kensington, MD U.S.A. diluted 1 100 was mixed 1 1 vol vol with patients serum samples diluted 1 4 and incubated for 120 min. The mixture was transferred to the precoated wells, incubated for 60 min, and wells were washed with phosphate buffered saline PBS . Wells were incubated with goat antirabbit IgG linked to alkaline phosphatase SigmaChemical Co., St. Louse, MO, U.S.A. , for 60 min. Alkaline phosphatase activity was determined using p nitrophenyldisodium phosphate substrate Houghton, A.N., et al. 1983 J. Exp. Med. 158 58 65.R24 concentrations were determined by comparison to standards using different concentrations of purified R24 diluted in a pretreatment serum sample from the patient. Human IgG antibody against mouse Ig was detected by enzyme linked immunoassays. Faicon 3034 plates precoated with R24 50 micrograms ml were incubated with patients serum samples diluted 1 50 for 60 min, and washed with PBS.Antihuman IgG linked to alkaline phosphatase Sigma ChemicalCo. , was incubated in wells for 60 min, and reaction were measured by spectrophotometry Houghton, A.N., et al. 1983 Supra . Indirect immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase procedures were performed as previously described in the art Eriandson, R.A., et al. 1984 Am. J. Surg. Path. in press . The following reagents Ortho Diagnostic Systems,Raritan, NJ, U.S.A. were used for testing issue sections OKT 3, OKT 4, OKT 8 antibodies to T cell markers OKB 2 andOKB 7 antibodies to B cell markers OKM 1 and OKM 5 antibodies to macrophage markers and OKIa 1 to human Ia antigens. Goat antisera to the human complement componentsC3, C5 and C9 were provided by Dr. Carl Wilhelm Vogel. R24 was used at concentration of 40 micrograms ml. Mouse IgG in tumor tissues was detected by incubating section directly with biotinylated antimouse IgG, then with avidin peroxidase conjugates and substrate. The toluidine blue staining method was used to detect tissue mast cells. The examples below are for illustrative purposes and are not meant to limit the invention. Patient Characteristics Table I lists the clinical features of the 12 patients included in the study. The patients received total doses of 8 mg m2 thrre patients , 80 mg m2 six patients and 240 mg m2 three patients . The median age was 40 years range 25 67 and the median performance status was 70 range 60 90 . Six patients had received prior che otherapy, radiation therapy or interferon treatment. patients had skin or soft tissue disease. In addition, visceral metastases were present in seven patients, including lung three patients , brain three patients and liver one patient . Toxicity No side effects were observed in the three patients treated with the lowest does of R24 8 mg M2 . All patients receiving a total dose of 80 mg M2 or greater had skin reactions, manifested by urticaria and prurits usually developing 2 4 hrs after starting treatment. The intensity of skin reactions was related to the dose level and rate of antibody infusion. Urticaria characteristically appeared over tumor sites in the skin and subcutaneous soft tissue and around surgical scars where tumor had been removed. One patient patient 6 developed urticarial lesions at sites where she had received melanoma cell vaccines ref eight months previously. No reactions developed at R24 skin test sites or around surgical scars unrelated to tumor treatment.Six patients went on to develop more generalized urticarial lesions over the face, trunk or limbs patients 5,7,8,10,11,12 . Patient 5 experienced mild wheezing after rapid infusion of antibody 10 mg hr s in this case the dose of R24 was reduced to 66 of the total intended dose.Diphenhydramine was effective in controlling side effects, but was only used for systemic symptoms. At a dose level of 80 mg M, the severity of skin reactions, particularly pruritus was found to be related to the rate of infusion of R24. Treatment was tolerated well when the infusion rate was maintained at less than 5 mg hr.At this rate, skin reactions usually occurred only after the first, second and third infusions and not after subsequent treatments. AT 240 mg M2, R24 was administered by continuous infusion to maintain an infusion rate below 5 mg hr. All three patients treated at this dose level developed urticaria initially restricted to tumor sites which later became generalized. Patients 10 and 11 experienced mild nausea and vomitting between 4 and 8 hrs after the start of treatment. Temperature elevation up to 37.80C was seen in patients 11 and 12 near the end of treatment. No hepatic, renal, hematopoietic or neurological toxicity was observed and no changes were noted in vision or skin pigmentation over a period of up to 9 months follow up. Antitumor Effects Table I summarizes tumor responses in patients treated with R 4. Major tumor regression was observed as illustrated. Example 1 Patient 3, is a 36 year old woman with primary malignat melanoma of the back, Clark s Level IV, 5mm depth of invasion diagnosed 9 82. In 8 83, the patient was found to have recurrent tumor and on 11 30 83, treatment with R24 was started, 1 mg M 1.7 mg every other day for weight doses. No toxicity or reactions at tumor sites were noticed during treatment. Sites of measurable disease included a firm 7 x 9 cm right axillary mass, a 4 x 2.5 cm subcutaneous nodule over the right hip and a 3 x 4.5 cm right paratracheal mass. A poorly defined density was present in the right upper lobe of the lung. Regression of tumor in the axilla and paratracheal region was first observed five weeks after starting treatment. The paratracheal mass has been undetectable since 3 84.The right axillary mass measured 1.2 x 0.8 cm in 5 84 and has continued to regress.The subcutaneous nodule over the right hip did not change in size but became very tender and inflamed by 2 5 84.Excisional biopsy of this lesion revealed hemorrhagic necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltrates with small nests of melanoma cells which stained weakly or not at all withR24 By 5 84, the density in the right upper lung fiedel had become better defined, and a needle biopsy revealed melanoma cells which reacted strongly with R24. Example 2 Patient 4 had a malignant melanoma diagnosed 2 82, 7 mm thickness, Clark s Level IV, with tumor in 10 of 12 regional lymph nodes. By 1 84, the patient had extensive bulky skin and soft tissue metastases over 100 lesions on the left thigh, in the left and right inguinal areas, and on the lower abdomen, scrotum and penis. Treatment awith R24 20 mg m2 every other day for eight doses, was started on 1 18 84. Two hours after the start of the first infusion, the patient developed severe pruritus and urticarial lesions around all tumor sites. Urticaria progressed to confluent erythrema over tumor sites and adjacent areas of the thigh, inguinal areas and lower abdominal wall. These reactions disappeared 18 hrs later. A milder reaction was seen after the second and third doses and no reactions were seen during subsequent treatments.Eight weeks following the end of R24 treatment, there was enlargement of lesions in the right groin and left thigh and new lesions had appeared over the abdominal wall. However, four weeks later, all measurable lesions had decreased in size by greater than 50 . There has been continued tumor regression over the past six months and most sites are now tumor free. Example 3 Patient 10 is a 61 year old man who developed a melanoma, 2.8 mm thickness, Clark s Level III, over the right scapular area in 1977. A solitary lesion of the left frontal lobe of the brain was detected in 1 82 and treated by left frontal lobe craniotomy followed by whole brain radiation therapy. Between 6 83 and 10 83, multiple subcutaneous tumors developed over the trunk, and the patient continued to progress during sequential treatment with dacarbazine, Pimozide, CCNU, and dibromodulcitol. Treatment with R24 , 240mg M2, by intravenous infusion over two weeks was started on 6 11 84. ThWe patient had more than 30 skin and soft tissue lesions on the trunk, extremities, scalp, face and neck measuring between 1. and 5 cm in diameter. Four hours after starting treatment the patient developed urticaria first around tumor lesions and then becoming generalized by six hours. The skin reactions abated over the next 12 hours and were gone by the fourth day of treatment. Regression greater than 90 of several pigmented tumors was seen at the end of R24 treatment, and generalized regression of lesions was observed by four weeks after starting therapy. During tumor regression, subcutaenous ecchymoses were noted over six responding tumor sites.The patient achieved a partial remission greater than 50 regression of measurable lesions and regression of lesions has continued. In the face of regression of skin and soft tissue lesions, the patient developed left mild hemiplegia eight weeks after the start of therapy. CTT image of the brain demonstrated an enlarging lesion in the putamen with a necrotic center. Example 4 Mixed responses were observed in two other patients patients 2 and 9 Table I . Patient 7 and rapid progression of bulky skin and soft tissue disease with deterioration of performance status and received dacarbazine five weeks after the start of R24 treatment she achieved a partial response three weeks after dacarbazine treatment and has remained in remission for more than 20 weeks. Patient 5 also showed progression of disease with development of new skin nodules at six weeks. Treatment with dacarbazine resulted in a partial response lasting now more than 20 weeks. Serology Table II presents serological studies performed on patients treated with R24 which show 1. There was heterogeneity in the expression ofGD3 in the melanoma specimens obtained before treatment, ranging from 40 positive cells to 1008 positive cells. 2. Peak R24 levels were related to the amount of antibody received. Median peak R24 levels were 0.8 microgram ml at 8 mg M2, 7 microgram ml at 80 mg M2, and 58 microgram ml at 240 mg M2. R24 levels fell off rapidly after the lastR24 treatment and were usually less than 5 of peak levels by 18 hrs after the end of therapy. 3. Elevated levels of human IgG against mouse Ig were detected in all evaluable patients between 15 and 40 days after the start of therapy. 4. There was no evidence of antigenic modulation during therapy. Tumor cells biopsied or aspirated during therapy in patients 4 and 10 demonstrated continued expression of GD3 in the face of substantial levels of circulating and tumor bound R24. 5. Progression of tumor after R24 treatment was not related to outgrowth of GD3 negative cells. Biopsies done after tumor persistence of progression showed stronglyGD3 positive melanoma cells in the lung lesion of patient 3 and skin lesions of patients 5, 6 and 9. 6. The amount of R24 reaching tumor cells appeared to correspond to the dose level of antibody given.Mouse IgG was not detected in lesions from a patient treated at 8 mh M2 patient 2 , but was detected aweakly around vessels in patient 4 80 mg M and strongly around vessels and on a proportion of tumor cells in patient 10 240 mg M2 . 7. Inflammation at tumor sites involved several components associated with immune reactions. Tumors from patients 4 and 10 had increased numbers of mast cells with evidence of mast cell degranulation, evidence of complement deposition including C3, C5 and C9, and infiltration withT8 Ia lymphocytes. Tumor tissue taken immediately before treatment did not demonstrate these charcteristics. A variety of mechanisms may be involved in the antitumor activity of R24, ranging from antibody directed complement mediated cytotoxicity and cell mediated cytotoxicity, to tumor cell injury secondary to the inflammatory reaction elicited in the tumor bed by R24.Tumor biopsies showed a range of inflammatory changes inR24 treated patients, with infiltration of T cells and mast cells, mast cell degranulation, and deposition of C3, C5 andC9 complement components being among the most prominent.Dippold et al. have also observed inflammatory reactions over tumor sites in two patients treated with R24 Dippold,W.G., et al. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 25 978 abstract . However, no tumor regression was found. In our studies of a large number of mouse monoclonal antibodies to surface antigens of human cancer,R24 has been found to be unique in its ability to activate human complement to such a high degree and to induce extremely strong cell mediated cytotoxicity. Whether these are general characteristics of antibodies like R24 that belong to the IgG3 subclass or are related to the nature of the G antigenic determinant is not known. These questions can be addressed by studying other classes and subclasses ofGD3 monoclonal antibodies and IgG3 antibodies to either surface antigens. Complement components, such as C5a, that are generated during complement activation are known to have inflammatogenic activity organ, E.L., et al. 91984 Fed.Proc. 43 2543 2547. , and it is likely that these are involved in R24 directed inflammation at the tumor site. If complement activation plays a key role in R24 induced inflammation and antitumor effects, attention needs to be directed at complement levels, both systemic and intratumoral, during R24 therapy to determine whether complement availability might limit the therapeutic activity of R24. Another aspect of R24 that needs clinical evaluation is the possibility that responses to chemotherapy may be enhanced or potentiated by R24. Studies in nu nu rats and mice have shown that the antitumor effect of R24 is potentiated by drugs such as adriamycin. Increased tumor blood flow and altered susceptibility of tumor cells to the action of drugs as a consequence of antibody treatment are two possibilities that could account for increased drug sensitivity of R24 treated animals. This observation may have its counterpart in the clear responses of twoR24 treated patients to dacarbazine.Thus R24 could be combined with other chemotherapeutic anti tumor agents selected but not limited to those such as the purine or pyrimidine analogues1 the nitrosoureas, cisretinoic acid, pimozide, dibromodulcitol, DTIC, cytoxan, methotrexate hydroxyurea, 6 mercapto purine, adriamycin, cisplatin, bleomycin, actinomycin D and or radiological treatment such 17 as 60Co or yttrium, I or astatine. Natural agents or factors such as tumor necrosis factor TNF Williamson et al 1983 Proc. nat l. Acad. Sci USA 80 5397 , BCG, autologous tumor cell vaccine Houghton et al inImmunodermatology ed. by Bigan Safai and Robert A. GoodPlenum, 1981 see p. 570 , Interferon, Interleukin 2 SeeWelte et al 1982 J. Exp. Med. 156 454 and U.S.PatentApplication S.N. 603,580 , Interleukin l and Lymphotoxins in general can also be used in conjunction with R24, administered together or in linkage form. Some nitrosourea for example are BCNU 1,3 Bis 2 chloroethyl 1 nitrosoureal, CCNU 1 2 chloroethyl 3 cyclohexyl 1nitrosourea and methyl CCNU. Purine and pyrimidine analogues may include 6 mercaptopurine, 5 fluorouracil, and 2,6 diaminapurine for example. Others will be apparant to those skilled in the art. Also available for clinical use will be a link of the mouse variable region of R24 to a human Fc portion for a more human like immunoglobulin. This can be done by linking the DNA region coding for the mouse variable portion of theIg molecules with a DNA region coding for the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin to produce a mixed R24 with a human Fc component which may be tolerated better at higher doses. It is also possible to link R24 molecules to fluorescent agents to localize tumors. Also these could be linked to R24 to localize as well as treat the tumor in situ. R24 has already been linked to 131j to localize as well as treat tumors such as melanomas.Melanocyte disorders such as Nevi or pigmentation disorders could be treated as well. R24 has also been found useful in treatment since it reacts with epithelial carcinomas such as those of lung and breast. The listing above is meant as a series of examples and is by no means limiting to the invention as described. Other examples will be apparent to those skilled in the art. However, a dose response relation to R24 may not be straightforward, since patients responses will be influenced by a number of other parameters, e.g., strength and heterogeneity of GD3 antigen expression, tumor cell accessibility, and availability of accessory factors such as complement, histamine and inflammatory cells.
