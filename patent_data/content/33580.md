## Description
NOVEL BENZENAMINES, THEIR PREPARATION AND FUNGICIDE AND ANTICOCCIDIAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM Benzenamines have experienced widespread usage in the field of agriculture. Numerous benzenamines are known which are effective as herbicidal agents. Among the most widely used herbicidal benzenamines are tri fluralin, which is N,N di n propyl 2,6 dinitro 4 trifluoromethylbenzenamine, butralin, which is N 1 methylpropyl 2,6 dinitroot tErt utylbenzer.am ne, and benefin, N butyl N ethyl 2,6 dinitro 4 trifluoromethylbenzenamine. Several benzenamines are known to be useful in animal health. For example, European Patent No.156, published January 10, 1979, discloses variousN 2,4 dinitro 6 trifluoromethylphenyl benzenamines which are said to exhibit useful insecticidal, acari cidal, nematocidal, insect growte retardant, fungicidal and bactericidal activity. Similarly, antifungal benzenamines are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,152,460. This invention provides certain novel nJ nitrophenyl polyfluorosethoxybenzenamines which are potent antifungal agents, and which also display ectoparasitic and anticoccidial activity This invention concerns novel benzenamines, formulations containing such compounds, and a method for treating soil and plant fungal diseases.The invention is more particularly directed to N nitro phenyl tetra and penta fluoroethoxy benzenamine com cunds of the formula EMI2.1 wherein RO is hydrogen or fluoro RÚ is hydrogen or C1 C2 alkyl Rê and R independently are hydrogen or halo R4 is hydrogen, trifluoromethyl, cyano, C1 C4 alkyl, hydroxycarbonyl or C1 C4 alkoxycarbonyl R5 is hydrogen, halo, nitro, hydroxy, methoxy or amino R6 is hydrogen or nitro and the physiologically acceptable salts thereof. Preferred compounds provided by this invention include those having the above formula wherein R6 is nitro. Especially preferred compounds comprehended by this invention are those of the formulaEMI2.2 wherein R0is hydrogen or fluoro RÚ is hydrogen or C c alkyl Rê and R independently are hydrogen or halo, R5 is hydrogen or halo and the physiologicallyacceptable salts thereof. Additionally preferred compounds are those wherein R2 and R3 are the same, R4 is hydrogen, tri fluoromethyl, cyano, C1 C4 alkyl, or hydroxycarbonyl R5 is chloro, bromo or nitro and R6 is nitro. Another preferred group of benzenamines according to this invention have the above formula wherein R0, R1, R2 R3 and R5 all are hydrogen, R is trifluoromethyl and R6 is nitro. A further embodiment of this invention is formulation comprising an N nitrophenyl polyfluoroethoxy benzenamine defined by the above general formula admixed with a suitable carrier, diluent or excipient therefor. Also provided by this invention is a method for treating fungicidal infections in plants and in soil comprising applying to the locus to be treated an antifungal amount of a benzenamine defined by the above formula. R1in the above formula defines hydrogen orC1 C2 alkyl, namely methyl or ethyl. Rê, R and R5 include the groups referred to herein as halo . The term bears its art recognized meaning of fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. Preferred halo groups defined by R2, R and R5 are chloro and bromo. R4 in the above formula includes C1 C4 alkyl groups, which are straight and branched chain alkyl group having from one to four carbon atoms. TypicalC1 C4 alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, n propyl iso propyl, n butyl and tert. butyl. R4 additionally defines a C1 C4 alkoxycarbonyl moiety, for instance methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, isopropoxycarbonyl, n butoxycarbonyl, and related groups. The N nitrophenyl tetra and penta fluoroethoxybenzenamines comprehended by this invention can be prepared by any of several chemical processes. A preferred and commonly utilized process involves the condensation reaction of a substituted phenyl electrophilic agent with a phenylamine derivative. For example, a polyfluoroethoxyphenyl electrophilic agent such as a phenyl halide can be condensed with a nitro chenslamine according to the following scheme EMI4.1 wherein R0, R1, R2 R3 R4, R5 and R6 are as defined above, and X is a good leaving group such as halo, for instance chloro, bromo or iodo.A similar, yet alternative, process comprises condensing a nitrophenyl electrophilic agent with a polyfluoroethoxyphenylamine according to the following scheme EMI5.1 wherein R0, RÚ, R2, R3 R4, R5 and R6 are as defined above, and X is a good leaving group such as halo.Such reactions are preferably carried out when R1is hydrogen. According to the processes outlined above, a substituted phenyl electrophilic agent such as a tetra or pentafluoroethoxyphenyl chloride is mixed with about an equimolar quantity of a nitrophenylamine. The condensation reaction generally is carried out in an unreactive organic solvent and in the presence of a strong base Commonly used unreactive organic solvents include amides, for instance dimethylformamide or hexamethylphosphortriamide ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, or dioxane sulfoxides sueh as dimethyl sulfoxide alcohols such as methanol or ethanol and related solvents. Strong bases which may be utilized in the reaction include alkali metal hydtides, for instance sodium hydride or lithium hydride amines such as triethylamine, pyridine, DBN 1,5 diazabicyolo 43.0 non 5 ene and DBU 1,5diazabicyclo 5.4.0 undec 5 ene, carbonates such as potassium carbonate and sodium carbonate alkoxides such as potassium tert. butoxide, and the like. The condensation reaction generally is carried out by first adding a phenylamine to a strong base in a suitable solvent. For instance, a phenylamine such as 3 1,1,2,2 tetrafluoroethoxyphenyl amine can be reacted with a base such as sodium hydride in a solvent such as dimethylformamide. The reactants can be employed in about equimolar quantites, or if desired an excess of base, for example about a 0.1 to about a 10 molar excess, can be utilized i desired.The phenylamine and the strong base generally are allowed to react for up to about 3 hours at a temperature of about 30 to about 300C., preferably about 0 to about 25 C. Following the initial reaction of the phenylamine and the strong base, the desired substituted phenyl electrophilic agent, for instance a compound such as 2,4 dinitro 6 trifluoromethylphenyl chloride, is added to the reaction mixture, and the reaction is permuted to continue for about 2 to about 48 hours at a tenperature of about 0 to about 1000C. The product of the condensation reaction is a compound comprehended by this invention and is readily isolated by simply adding the reaction mixture to an aqueous acid solution, for instance dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid. The desired product often precipitates out of the aqueous acid solution as a solid or an oil. Alternatively, the product may be extracted into a water immiscible organic solvent such as diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, dichioromethane, or the like. Removal of the organic solvent, for instance by evaporation under reduced pressure, then provides a compound of this invention.The product thus formed can be further purified if desired by any of several standard methods, including column chromatography over a solid support such as silica gel or the like, or crystallization from common solvents such as ethanol, benzene, skelly B, diethyl ether, acetone, and the like. Certain benzenamines provided by this invention can be prepared by modification of an existing benzenamine prepared as described above. For example, N alkylation of a benzenamine having the above formula wherein R 15 hydrogen affords the corresponding benzenamine wherein R1is C1 C2 alkyl.Such alkylation reactions typically are accomplished by combining an alkylating agent with a benzenamine wherein R1 is hydrogen in an unreactive organic solvent and in the presence of a base. Typical alkylating agents commonly used include alkyl halides such as methyl bromide or ethyl iodide, as well as sulfates such as dimethyl sulfate and diethyl sulfateCommonly used solvents include acetone, benzene, methyl ethyl ketone, dimethylsulfoxide and the like. The alkylation routinely is substantially complete within about two to about seventy two hours when carried out at a temperature of about 30 to about 150 C.The N alkylated benzenamine is generally isolated by extraction of the reaction mixture with a solvent such as diethyl ether or benzene, and then evaporation of the solvent from the extract. The product can be further purified if desired by crystallization, chroma tography, distillation, or related purification techniques. Benzenamines bearing a carboxylic acid moiety, that is to say compounds of the above general formula wherein R is hydroxycarbonyl, are readily 4 eserified to provide benzenamines wherein R4 is a C1 C4 alkoxy carbonyl group. Such conversion can be accomplished by standard esterification reactions.Methyl esters are often preferably prepared by simply reacting a free acid with diazomethane in a suitable solvent such as dimethyl ether. Esterification can also be accomplished by condensing a benzenamine carboxylic acid with a C1 C4 alkanol in the presence of an acid, for instance sulfuric acid or the like. Alternatively, a benzenamine carboxylic acid can be converted to an acid halide, and the acid halide then can be condensed with a C1 C4 alkanol.For example, reaction of a benzenamine such as N 2 nitro 4 hydroxycarbonylphenyl 4 1,1,2,2 tetrafluoroethoxylbenzenamine with oxalyl chloride affords N 2 nitro 4 chiorocarbonyl phenyl 4 1,1,2,2 tetrafluoroethoxy benzenamine, which when reacted with an alkanol such as isopropanol affords N 2 nitro 4 isopropoxycarbonylphenyl 4 1,1,2, 2 tetrafluoroethoxy benzenamine. Benzenamines having the above formula wherein 2 3 one or both of R2 and R3 are hydrogen can be halogenated by reaction with a halogenating agent in a suitable solvent. For instance, a compound such as N 2,6 dinitro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1,1,2,2 tetrafluoro ethoxy benzenamine can be reacted with about one equivalent, or an excess if desired, of bromine in the presence of a solvent such as dichloromethane or a mixture of acetic acid and water. Such reaction effects bromination to provide, for instance. N 2,6 dinitro 4 trifluoromethyl 2,4 dibromo 5 1,1,2,2 tetrafluoroethoxy benzenamine. When desired, the above described halo genation reaction can be carried out utilizing less than one molar quantity of halogenating agent, thereby effecting monohalogenation instead of dihalogenation.The monohalogenation product can be further halogenated if desired with the same or a different halogenating agent. For instance a benzenamine such as N 2,6 dinitro 4 trifluoromethylphenyl 3 1,1,2,2,2 penta luoroethoxy benzenamine can be reacted with about a 0.5 molar amount of chlorine in dichloromethane at about 250C. to give N 2,6 dinitro 4 trifluoromethyl pnehyl 2 chloro 3 1,1,2,2,2 pentafluoroethoxy benzenamineThe latter compound can be further halogenated, for instance by reaction with about a 0.5 to 10. molar amount of bromine in dichloromethane, to provide the corresponding dihalogenated derivative, for exampleN 2,6 dinitro 4 trifluoromethylphenyl 2 chloro 4hromo 5 1,1,2,2,2 pentafluoroethyoxy benzenamine. The benzenamines contemplated herein wherein is hydrogen are weakly acidic in nature by virtue of the activated proton attached to the amino nitrogen atom to which the two aromatic rings are attachedBecause of this acidic nature, the benzenamines readily form physiologically acceptable salts by reaction with any of a number of common inorganic and organic bases. The salts are in general solids and thus lend themselves to purification by crystallization from common solvents such as ethanol, acetone, ethyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone, and the like. The salts provided herein are prepared by reaction of about equimolar quantities of a benzenamine and a base. Inorganic bases commonly employed to form salts of this invention include the alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, as well as alkali metal amides such as lithium amide and potassium amide. Routinely used organic bases include alkali metal alkoxides such as potassium tert. butoxide and sodium methoxide, as well as alkali metal amides such as lithium or potassium diisopropylamide. When it is desired to regenerate the free amine from an addition salt, the salt is simply reacted with an acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid. For example, reaction of the sodium salt of N 2 4 dinitrophenyl 3 1,1,2, tetrafluoroethOxy benzenamine with about one equivalent amount of hydro chloric acid converts the salt to a free amine to provide N 2,4 dinitrophenyl 3 1,1,2,2 tetrafluoroethoxy benzenamine. Representative benzenamines comprehended by this invention include the following N 2, 6 dinitro 4 trifluoromethylphenyl 3 1,1,2,2 tetrafluoroethoxy benzenamine.

For example, about 30Q g. of a compound such as N 2,4 dinitro 6 trifluoro methylphenyl 4 trifluoromethoxy benzenamine can be added to about one ton of the above noted BroilerGrower mixture for use according to this invention.Similarly, about 200 to about 30Q g. of N 2 trifluoro methyl 5 chloro 4,6 dinitrophenyl 4 1,1,2,2 tetra fluoroethoxy benzenamine can be admixed to uniformity with about one ton of the above described TurkeyFinisher for administration to turkeys pursuant to the method of this invention. The benzenamines defined above can alternatively be formulated as a feedstuff pre mix. For example, a benzenamine can be admixed with a substantially inert carrier such as ground rice hulls, soybean meal, wheat middlings, fermentation mycelia and the like. Nutritive carriers such as cereals can also be utilized. Such mixture of carrier and benzenamine anticoccidiostat will preferably contain about 5 to about 90 percent by weight of the benzenamine anticoccidial agent, and more preferably about 20 to about 70 percent by weight. Such pre mix formulation is then mixed with a normal feed ration at a rate so that the active ingredient is present in about 20 to about 500 grams per ton of final feed ration. Still another formulation which can be utilized according to this invention comprises a benzenamine of the above formula substantially dissolved in drinking water, for example in the drinking water of poultry such as chickens and turkeys. For such formulations, it is occasionally preferred to utilize a physiologically acceptable salt such as the sodium or potassium salt, which compounds generally are substantially water soluble. For such formulation, it is often convenient to prepare water soluble powders or dispersible powders comprising a benzenamine admixed with carriers such as dextrose, sucrose, dimethyl sulfoxide, or other suitable diluent. Typically, the benzenamine with be present in such forms in about 0.01 to about 30 percent by weight.Such powder or liquid formulations are conveniently added to the poultry drinking water at the site of administration. The anticoccidial activity of the N nitro phenyl polyfluoroalkoxybenzenamines defined by the above formula has been doterinined in standard in vivo tests in chickens. A typical evaluation was conducted as follows one week old broiler chicks were alloted to five bird cages and wera fed a medicated or control ration, typically for one day, prior to infection with oocysts of a coccidiosis causing organism. The chicks were maintained on their respective rations for a period of time, typically seven days. Generally, there were from three to six replicates per treatment.Anticcoccidial efficacy was typically determined by the lesion scores, but other measures of efficacy were employed in many of the tests In determining lesion scores, the birds were sacrificed and the severity of lesions scored on a 0 4 scale, with lesion free birds scored as 0, extremely severe infections scored as 4, and intermediate degrees of infections scored as 1, 2, or 3. The scores of all birds which received a given treatment were averaged Table III below presents the results for the evaluation of N 2, 4 dinitro 6 trifluoromethylphenyl 4 1,1 Cl ,l,2, 2 tetrafluoroethoxy benzenamine. The results are a statistical analysis of intestinal lesion scores of broiler cockerels utilizing the Duncans Multiple Range Test P 0.05 and Gebhardts algorithm for unequal sample size. The data is reported with superscript letters, and those data not followed by a common letter are significantly different. The animals were inoculated with strains ofEimeria acervulina strain 59 and Eimeria maxima strain F.S. 177 .
