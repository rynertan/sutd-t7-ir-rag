## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to acyloxysteroids which are useful as a novel intermediate for use in the prepara tion of adrenocortical hormones such as hydrocortisone, prednisolone and the like.2. Description of the Prior Art Recently, androst 4 ene 3,17 dione and androsta 1,4 diene 3,17 dione have been produced in large quantities and inexpensively from streols such as cholesterol, sitosterol and the like by the use of microorganisms belonging to the genus Mycobacterium and thus various steroidal drugs such as estrone, testosterone, spironolactone, etc. have been produced from these starting materials. On the other hand, adrenocortical hormones corticoids which occupy a major proportion of the steroidal drugs are still prepared using as an intermediate progesterone from stigmasterol or 16 dehydro pregnenolone from diosgenin, or they are prepared from bile acids via a process comprising many steps. We have made extensive studies to develop a more economical process for preparing corticoids from starting materials including not only the afore mentioned androst 4 ene 3,17 dione and androsta 1,4 diene 3,17 dione which have recently been produced in large quantities and inexpensively, but also androsta 4,9 1l diene 3,17 dione which has been produced from 9a hydroxyandrost 4 ene 3,17 dione which has also recently been produced by a fermentative process. It has now been found that acyloxysteroids which are useful as a starting material in the preparation of corticoids can be obtained from the above described starting materials. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to novel intermediates, i.e., acyloxysteroids such as, e.g., 21,21 diiodo l7a hydroxypregna 1,4 diene 3,20 dione 17 acetate, 21 iodo l7a hydroxypregna l, 4 diene 3 , 20 dione 17 acetate, 21,21 dibromo 17a hydroxypregn 4 ene 3,20 dione 17acetate, 21 bromo 17 alpha hydroxypregn 4 ene 3,20 dione 17 acetate, etc., which are useful for the preparation of corticoids such as hydrocortisone and prednisolone, and a process for producing the same. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTSThe acyloxysteroids according to the present invention are represented by the following general formula I EMI3.1 wherein the dotted lines on the ring represent a single or double bond, A represents an acyloxy group, and Y represents Br, Br2, I or 12. The preparation of the above compounds according to the invention is then described. A When the compound of the general formula I is a diiodosteroid of the general formula Ia EMI3.2 wherein the dotted lines and A are as defined in the general formula I , it can be prepared through a procedure represented by the following reaction schema EMI4.1 In the above formulae, the dotted lines and A are as defined in the general formula I .The diiodosteroid can be prepared by reacting an iodizing agent capable of releasing positive iodine atom with a 17B ethynyl 17a acyloxysteroid of the general formula II EMI4.2 wherein the dotted lines on the ring represent a single or double bond, and A represents an acyloxy group.For instance, when either iodizing agents capable of generating positive iodine atom such asN iodosuccinimide, N iodoacetamide and the like, or positive iodine atom which have been generated in the reaction system by oxidation of iodine with peracids such as peracetic acid or metal ions having the ability of oxidation potential such as cupric acetate is reacted with steroids such as 17ss ethynyl 17a hydroxyandrosta 1, 4 diene 3 one 17 acetate, 17ss ethynyl 17a hydroxyandrost 4 ene 3 one 17 acetate, 17B ethynyl 17a hydroxyandrosta 4,9 11 diene 3 one 17 acetate and the like, these starting steroids are converted into 21,21 diiodo 17a hydroxypregna 1,4 diene 3,20 dione 17 acetate, 21,21diiodo 17a hydroxypregn 4 ene 3,20 dione 17 acetate, 21,21 diiodo 17a hydroxypregna 4,9 11 diene 3,i0 dione 17 acetate and the like, respectively.The preparation method is described in more detail.The iodizing agent capable of releasing positive iodine atom usable for this purpose includes Niodoimides and N iodoamides such as N iodosuccinimideN iodoacetamide and the like Furthermore, the positive iodine atom can be generated in the reaction system by reacting various oxidizing agents with iodine. In the latter case, examples of the oxidizing agents include peracids such as peracetic acid, perbenzoic acid and the like, hydroperoxides such as hydrogen peroxide, t butyl hydroperoxide and the like, salts of metallic ions having the oxidization potential such as silver nitrate, cupric nitrate, cupric acetate and the like. Among them, peracetic acid is the most preferred oxidizing agent because of its inexpensiveness, industrial availability, and good reactivity.The amount of the iodizing agent is generally two or more equivalents, preferably 2.05 2.5 equivalents, of the acetylene compound used.The solvents may be any solvents ordinarily employed from the industrial aspect but methyl ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and the like which react with the iodizing agents are not favorable.Preferred solvents are aliphatic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid and the like.In the reaction procedure, it is the usual practice to allow water to coexist with reaction solvents.If water is absent, water is added after completion of the reaction in order to hydrolyze the resulting product to obtain a desired diiodo ketone. Water is generally used at least in an equimolar amount with respect to the acetylene compound and is suitably in an amount of 5 to 20 of the solvent used.The acyloxysteroids of the general formula II which are employed as the starting material in accordance with the process of the invention can be prepared by reacting carboxylic anhydrides or acid halides with 17ss ethynyl 17a hydroxysteroids of the general formula lIE EMI7.1 wherein the dotted lines on the ring independently represent a single or double bond. This preparation is feasible by several procedures.The first procedure includes the reaction of a carboxylic anhydride such as acetic anhydride with the 17ss ethynyl 17a hydroxysteroid of the general formula m in an aromatic amine such as pyridine.In the case, the acid anhydride should be used in an amount of equimole or more, preferably five or more times in mole as great as the steroid. The reaction temperature is in the range of 80 to 1500C, preferably 100 to 1350C. The second procedure comprises the reaction of the steroids of the general formula m with a carboxylic anhydride in a solvent such as acetic acid. In this case, acid compounds or Lewis acids such as p toluenefulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid1 zinc chloride, iron chloride and the like are used as a catalyst. The reaction temperature is normally in the range of 0 to 500C. B Preparation of compounds of the invention in case where the compounds of the general formula I are monoiodosteroids of the general formula Ib EMI8.1 wherein the dotted lines and A are as defined in the general formula I .The monoiodosteroids represented by the general formula Ib according to the invention include, for example, 2l iodo l7a hydroxypregn 4 ene 3, 20 dione 17 acetate, 21 iodo 17a hydroxypregn 4 ene 3,20 dione 17 propionate, 21 iodo 17a hydroxypregna 1,4diene 3, 20 dione 17 acetate, 21 iodo 17a hydroxypregna 4,9 11 diene 3,20 dione 17 acetate and the like.In order to prepare the monoiodosteroid of the general formula Ib it is sufficient to contact the diiodosteroid of the general formula Ia with hydrogen atom containing organic solvents.The diiodosteroids of the general formula Ia include, for example, 21,2i diiodo 17a hydroxypregn 4 ene 3,20 dione 17 acetate, 21,21 diiodo 17a hydroxypregn 4 ene 3,20 dione 17 propionate, 21,21 diiodo 17a hydroxypregna 1,4 diene 3,20 dione 17 acetate, 21,21 diiodo 17a hydroxypregna 4,9 1l diene 3,20 dione 17 acetate and the like.The hydrogen atom containing organic solvents used for the above purpose are organic solvents which are capable of releasing hydrogen ions protons or hydrogen radicals and are almost all the ordinarily, industrially employed solvents such as acetic acid, triethylamine, dimethylformamider acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, methanol, chloroform, benzene and the like. Preferred solvents are amines such as triethylamine, diethylamine and the like, and methyl ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and the like, among which the latter methyl ketones are most preferred. These solvents are used in amounts enough for ordinary use as solvent.When methyl ketones are used, the coexistence of at least one member selected from basic compounds including alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and the like, aliphatic amines such as triethylamine, diethylamine and the like, and aromatic amines such as dimethylaminoaniline, pyridine, and carbonates and carboxylates of the basic compounds such as potassium carbonate, potassium acetate trithylamine acetate and the like will give an extremely promoting effect of the reaction thus improving the yield of monoiodo ketones Ib to a remarkable extent.The basic compounds or carbonates or carboxylates thereof are generally used in equimolar or greater amounts relative to the diiodosteroids Ia . The reaction temperature is generally in the range of 10 to 1000C.Moreover, the monoiodosteroids of the general formula Ib can be prepared by reducing the diiodosteroids of the general formula Ia with dithionites.The dithionites used in the practice of the invention include sodium dithionite hydrosulfite , potassium dithionite, calcium dithionite, zinc dithionite, lithium dithionite, magnesium dithionite and the like, among which sodium dithionite is favorably used. The amount is generally in the range of 1.0 to 1.3 equivalents, preferably 1.0 to 1.2 equivalents, with respect to the a,o diiodo ketone. Greater amounts are disadvantageous in that monoiodo ketones are further reduced to ketones and thus a desired yield cannot be obtained.The solvents used may be any industrially employed solvents such as benzene, tetrahydrofuran, acetone, acetic acid and the like. The reaction temperature is in the range of 0 to 500C, preferably 5 to 300C.According to this procedure, the monoiodosteroid can be obtaied by directly adding dithionites to the reaction solution for the production of a corresponding diiodosteroid without isolating the diiodosteroid from the reaction solution.For instance, an ethynylated steroid of the general formula II EMI11.1 wherein the dotted lines and A are as defined in the general formula I , is reacted with positive iodine atom to obtain a solution of the diiodosteroid of the general formula Ia , to which solution is directly added a dithionite to give the mono iodosteroid of the general formula Ib . C Preparation of compounds of the invention in case where the compounds of the general formula I are dibromosteroids of the general formula Ic EMI12.1 wherein the dotted lines and A are as defined in the general formula I .Compounds of the general formula Ic include, for example, 21, 21 dibromo l7a hydroxypregn 4 ene 3, 20 dione 17 acetate, 21,21 dibromo 17a hydroxypregn 4ene 3,20 dione 17 propionate, 21,21 dibromo 17ahydroxypregna 1,4 diene 3,20 dione 17 acetate, 21,21dibromopregna 4,9 11 diene 3,20 dione 17 acetate and the like. The dibromosteroids of the general formula Ic can be prepared by causing halogenating agents capable of releasing positive bromine atom to react with the 17ss ethynyl 17a acyloxysteroid of the general formula II EMI13.1 wherein the dotted lines and A are as defined in the general formula T . In order to produce the dibromosteroids of the general formula Ic by reacting halogenating agents capable of releasing positive bromine atom with the acyloxysteroids of the general formula II as mentioned above, there are used, as the halogenating agent,N bromoimides and N bromoamides such as N bromosuccinimide, N dibromodimethylhydantoin, N dibromobenzenesulfonamide, N bromoacetamide and the like.The amount is in the range of 2 times or more in mole, preferably 2.1 to 3 times in mole, that of 17ss ethynyl 17a acyloxysteroid. The reaction solvents are usually mixed solvents of aliphatic carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and the like, and water. The reaction temperature is in the range of 5 to 600C, preferably 0 to 300C. For the purpose of neutralizing hydrobromic acid produced by side reaction, there may be added alkali metal salts of carboxylic acids such as sodium acetate, potassium propionate and the like. D Preparation of compounds of the invention in case where the compounds of the general formula I are monobromosteroids of the general formula Id EMI14.1 wherein the dotted lines and A are as defined in the general formula I .The monobromosteroids of the general formula id can be obtained by racting the dibromosteroids of the general formula Ic EMI14.2 wherein the dotted lines and A are as defined in the general formula I , with a phosphite .iich as trialkyl phosphites or triaryl phosphites. The reaction of these dibromosteroids with trialkyl phosphite compounds such as triethyl phosphite or triaryl phosphite compounds such as triphenyl phosphite gives the monobromosteroids of the general formula Id in high yield.The amount of the phosphite compounds is equimolar to or greater than the dibromosteroid, and preferably 1.2 to 10 times by mole as great as the dibromosteroid.The reaction ordinarily requires the use of a solvent.The solvents for this purpose may be any solvents which are ordinarily employed industrially.Preferred solvents include nitro compounds such as nitromethane, nitrobenzene and the like, lower alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and the like, lower carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid and the like. Especially when lower alcohols or lower carboxylic acids soluble in water are employed, products are caused to precipitate merely by the addition of water to the reaction solution and thus monobromosteroids can be obtained by a simple operation such as filtration. The reaction temperature is in the range of 0 to 50 C, preferably 5 to 300C.As the monobromosteroids of the general formula Id there can be mentioned, for example, 21 bromo 17ahydroxypregn 4 ene 3,20 dione 17 acetate, 21 bromo 17 alpha hydroxypregn 4 ene 3,20 dione 17 propionate, 21 bromo 17 alpha hydroxypregna 1,4 diene 3,20 dione 17acetate, 21 bromo 17 alpha hydroxypregna 4,9 11 diene 3,20 dione 17 acetate and the like.The acyloxysteroids of the formulae Ia , Ib , Ic and Id can be ccnverted into hydrocortisone and prednisolone through the procedure exemplified by the following reaction schema.

For the reaction between the acyloxysteroid of the general formula Ib or Id and the quaternary ammonium salt of the lower aliphatic acid, there is usually used a solvent. The solvents are preferably aprotic solvents including, for example, dimethylformamide, N methylpyrolidone, dimethylacetamide and the like. The reaction temperature is in the range of 10 to 800C, preferably 0 to 400C. Higher temper atures are unfavorable because olefinic side products whose acyloxy group at the 17 position is eliminated increase in amounts.b Process of reacting the acyloxysteroids of the general formula Ib or Id with alkali metal salts of aliphatic acids in the presence of polar, aprotic solvents and or polyethylene glycols As one of the solvents used in this process is a polar, aprotic solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, N methylpyrrolidone or the like. When these solvents are used, the halogen atom is substituted with an acyloxy group. The reaction temperature is in the range of 1000C or below and favorably in the range of 40 to 800C. Higher temperatures are unfavorable since there are secondarily produced 21 acyloxypregna4,16 diene ,20 diones in which the acyloxy group at the 17 position is eliminated, e.g. 21 acetoxypregna 4,16 diene 3,20 dione, 21 acetoxypregna 1,4,16 triene 3,20 dione and the like. Because of conversion of intended 17 acyloxyaceto 17 acyloxysteroids of the general formula IV into the above mentioned side products, too long reaction times are unfavorable. The reaction is generally stopped when the conversion of the starting materials reaches 80 to 97t, preferably 85 to 95 . N me thylpyrrolidone or dimethylacetamide is preferably used since high conversions are attained with reduced formation of side products. Another solvent or medium includes polyethylene glycols, which are those having molecular weight of 200 to 1500, preferably 300 to 600 and including polyethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether, polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether and the like. Some of these polyethylene glycols may be solid, in which case they are used by mixing with a suitable solvent such as, for example, N methylpyrrolidone, dimethylacetamide, dimethylformamide or the like. Even though the steroids are not dissolved in these polyethylene glycols, the glycols may be used by mixing with a suitable solvent for the steroids. The reaction temper ature is generally in the range of 10 to 800C, preferably 20 to 500C. The alkali metal salts of lower aliphatic acids are those which have not more than 10 carbon atoms and include, for example,sodium formate, potassium formate, sodium acetate, potassium acetate, potassium propionate and the like, among which potassium acetate is most preferable.c Reaction of acyloxysteroids of the general formula Ib or Id with alkali metal salts of lower aliphatic acids in the presence of crown ethers The alkali metal salts of lower aliphatic acids are those defined in b . The crown ethers are, for example, macro ring compounds such as 18 crown 6, dibenzo 18crown 6, dicyclohexyl 18 crown 6, cyclohexyl12 crown 4, dibenzo 14 crown 4, tetrabenzo24 crown 8 and the like. Choice of the crown ethers depends on the type of the alkali metal salts 18 crown 6 compounds are favorable for potassium salts such as potassium acetate, potassium propionate and the like and cyclohexyl 15 crown 5 and dibenzo 18 crown 6 compounds are favorable for sodium salts such as sodium acetate, sodium propionate and the like. The most preferable combination is a combination of potassium acetate and 18 crown6. These crown ethers are used in an amount equimolar with or greater than a steroid used and preferably in the range of 1.2 to 2.0 times by mole as great as the steroid.The reaction usually requires use of solvents.A variety of aprotic solvents may be used and preferably highly polar, aprotic solvents are used such as dimethylformamide, N methylpyrrolidone, dimethylacetamide and the like.The reaction temperature is generally in the range of 0 to 800C, preferably 10 to 400C. Higher temperatures result in formation of olefinic side products in which the acyloxy group at the 17 position is eliminated.ii Preparation of 17a hydroxyprogesterone widely used as a drug such as gestagen from the acyloxysteroids of the general formula Ia or Ib The contact of the iodosteroids of the general formula Ia or Ib with methyl ketones can yield progesterones of the general formula V EMI23.1 wherein the dotted lines and A are as defined in the general formula I .The methyl ketones used for this purpose include acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, acetophenone and the like, among which acetone is favorably used. These methyl ketones are used in amounts enough for solvent and is preferably employed also as a solvent. In order to carry out this process, the iodosteroids of the general formula Ia or Ib are dissolved in, for example, a methyl ketone such as acetone, followed by agitating over a certain time. Where the iodosteroid is a diiodosteroid Ia such as 21,21 diiodo 17a hydroxypregn 4 ene 3,20 dione 17 acetate, a monoiodosteroin such as 21 iodo 17a hydroxypregn 4 ene 3,20 dione 17 acetate is first produced and further agitation results in formation of 17a hydroxypregn 4 ene 3, 20 dione 17 acetate.In this process, coexistence of acidic compounds will cause the reaction to proceed much more rapidly with an improved yield of progesterones.The acidic compounds include, for example, inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, perchloric acid and the like, organic acids such as methanesulfonic acid, ptoluenesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and the like.These acidic compounds may be in the form of salts with weakly basic compounds such as pyridine.These acidic compounds or their salts are ordinarily used in an amount equimolar with the starting iodosteroids. In general, the reaction is effected at temperatures of 0 to 100 C, preferably 10 to 4G X.
