# Non volatile semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
A non volatile semiconductor memory device has a plurality of memory cells which are coupled to a plurality of row or column lines through which a high voltage is supplied in a data write operation and a plurality of switching circuits, each of which is coupled to the corresponding row or column line. In a data write operation, only one of switching circuits is turned on to supply the high voltage to only one row or column lines coupled to a memory cell in which a data is to be written.
