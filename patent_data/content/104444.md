# FERMENTATION METHOD AND COMPOSITIONS INCLUDING A LACTOBACILLUS SPECIES STRAIN

## Abstract
Bacterial concentrates of cells of a Lactobacillus having the essential identifying characteristics of Lactobacillus sp. NRRL B 15,036 which are useful for food fermentations are described. Lactobacillus sp. NRRL B 15,036 ferments de xtrose, but not sucrose or lactose, to produce lactic acid in the food. Lactobacillus sp. NRRL B 15,036 is particularly useful for meat fermentations.
