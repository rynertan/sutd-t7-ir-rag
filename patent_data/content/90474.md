## Description
Method and device for sowing and planting out. The invention is related to a method for sowing and planting out in which sow blocks are positioned in longitudinal and cross rows below a sowing device and in the sow cavity of each sow block one or more seeds are introduced whereupon the seeds in the sow blocks develop in a suitable environment to seedlings, that together with the sow block are transferred to greater mutual distances in a substrate to grow up to plants. In the method applied until now the sow blocks are positioned abutting each other in shallow containers and placed below a sowing device. The containers with sow blocks provided with seeds subsequently are transferred to a green house or such. After some time the containers are transferred to a propagator who manually takes the sow blocks with the small pants out of the container and brings them at greater mutual distances in the soil or in one or the other substrate that is suitable for growing. The invention aims to mechanize said method. According to the invention this aim is obtained by the fact that the sow blocks are positioned in through going holes of a flat dish in which the sow blocks fit with play, said dish at the lower side is supported by a loose container that is provided with ventilation and or drain passages, which loose container stops the sow blocks, that the combination so formed is transferred below the sowing device and the seeds are given the opportunity to grow into seedlings in this combination, that the combinations with a conveyor device are led to a transplanting device, in which the dishes with the sow blocks are pushed out of the containers on a transplanting table, in which rows of holes are provided extending in longitudinal and cross direction, at a distance that is greater than the pitch between the sow blocks in the dish and that corresponds with the pitch of greater sow blocks to be positioned below the transplanting device and arranged in longitudinal and cross rows, which sow blocks form the substrate, in which the dimension of the holes in the transplanting table and of the cavities in the greater sow blocks that form the substrate is somewhat greater than the outside dimension of the smaller sow blocks and the depth of the cavity in the greater ones is about the same as the height of the smaller sow blocks and during transfer of the smaller sow blocks into the greater ones the dish is moved in longitudinal and cross direction with regard to the transplanting table. It will be clear that the sowing and the transplanting in general is performed at two different places. The transplanting mostly is done by propagators which grow crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers etc, while the sowing and growing of the seeds to seedlings mostly is done in specialized enterprises. The greater sow blocks also can be rock wool pots or oase blocks. With the method according to the invention in particular the labour intensive transplanting is omitted by which the working expenses are considerably reduced. The invention also is related to the combination of dish and container destined for performing the method, in which according to the invention the dish comprises a flat rectangular plate, preferably of plastic material, with throughgoing holes positioned in longitudinal and cross rows, in which the smaller sow blocks can be taken up with sideways play and the container comprises a bottom provided with ventilation and or drain passages and with upstanding edges along three sides, in which the dish fits. The invention is also related to a transplanting device that according to the invention is characterized by a substantially horizontally extending conveyor device, on which the combinations are fed with the open side of the containers in longitudinal direction of the conveyor device, by a transplanting table positioned crosswise to the conveyor device on which dishes can be pushed from the containers, in which table passages are present for the sow blocks, by a conveyor device for greater sow blocks positioned below the transplanting table, in which the first cited smaller sow blocks have to be provided at a greater pitch, by a mechanism to move the combinations stepwise along a distance corresponding to the width of the combination, by a mechanism that positions the dish from the container on the transplanting table by a mechanism to move the greater sow blocks which are positioned in longitudinal and cross rows stepwise so that always a further set of greater sow blocks is positioned below passages in the transplanting table and by a mechanism that moves the dish or the dishes present at the transplanting table along distances equal to the pitch or the half pitch of the sow blocks in the dish in two perpendicular directions. The invention will be elucidated with the aid of the drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows the combination of a dish and container in view from above and free from each other Fig. 2 is a view of the provision of the combination with sow blocks and the sowing of the sow blocks Fig. 3 is a view of a filled and sown combination during the sprouting of the seeds Fig. 4 shows in perspective a transplanting device Fig. 5 shows a view from above on a larger scale of a part of the transplanting device and Fig. 6a, 6b, 6c and 6d show different phases of the transplanting. Figure 1 shows a dish 1 at some distance above the container 2. The dish 1 comprises a thick rectangular plate of polystyrene or drawn or extruded hard plastic material or some other suitable material. In the dish 1 throughgoing cylindrical great holes 3 and small holes 5 are present. These holes 3 and 4 are positioned in longitudinal and cross rows. The number of great holes 3 is e.g. 96 in 12 rows each with 8 holes. This number, however, is purely illustrative. The container 2 comprises a bottom 5 and upstanding edges 6 along three sides. On line with the holes 3 and 4 of the dish 1 in the bottom 5 smaller holes 7 are provided. In figure 2 the dish 1 is positioned in the container 2 and the combination is placed below a sow block press 8 that is known per se, with which in a known manner cylindrical blocks 9 are formed, that after pressing fall in the holes 3. The outside diameter of these sow blocks 9, provided in a known manner with a sow cavity is somewhat smaller than the diameter of the holes 3, so the sow blocks 9 fit easily. The combinations 1, 2 move one after the other in the direction of the arrow A under the sow block press 8 and then arrive below a sowing device 10, that drops one or more seeds in each sow cavity. The combination 1, 2 subsequently moves on a conveyor, notshown along the lower side of the devices 8 and 10. The combination 1, 2 is then picked up and put on support edges 11 in a greenhouse or such, see figure 3. The combinations 1, 2 are positioned next to each other and the seeds have the opportunity to grow up to small plants. The smaller holes 4 in the dish 1 that are in one line with the holes 7 in the bottom 5 allow an air circulation through the dish 1 and between the plants, by which the sprouting and growing is promoted. The holes 7 in the bottom 5 that are in one line with the great holes 3 in the dish 1 serve as de watering holes. It is also possible to embody the bottom 5 as a grating with bars or it may consist of rigid mesh. These embodiments are not shown. In the side walls 6 of each container 2 holes 12 are provided in which the conveyor means 13 may grip, that are destined to move the combinations 1, 2 stepwise. After the development of the seeds to smaller plants the combinations 1, 2 are transferred to propagators where the plants have to be grown completely. The plants therefore have to be transplanted, that means they have to be transferred to mutual greater distances on one or another substrate that can be formed by earth, rock wool, greater sow blocks etc. This transplanting until now always is done manually and is very labour intensive and therefor costly. According to the invention this transplanting is mechanized for which in the first place is pointed to figure 4. On a conveyor device 14 the combinations 1, 2 are positioned with the open side of the containers 2 along one side wall of the conveyor device 14. With the aid of a plunger 15 or such the combinations 1, 2 are moved stepwise in the direction of the arrow B.During each step the combinations 1, 2 are moved along the width of a container 2. The plunger 15 for instance grips the lower side of each container 2. In this way a combination 1, 2 comes in front of a cross table 16, the so called transplanting table. The dish 1 with the sow blocks 9 and the small plants now are pushed out of the container 2 to above the table 16. Notwithstanding the fact that the dish 1 now is not supported anymore by the container 2 the sow blocks 9 cannot fall down, because they are held by the table 16. Below the cross table 16 a conveyor 17 is provided on which greater sow blocks 18 are positioned. These sow blocks 18 have a cavity 18a, in which the smaller sow blocks 9 fit with some play. With the plunger 19 the greater sow blocks 18 are moved stepwise in the direction of the arrow C. In the cross table 16 sixteen holes 20 are provided, see figure 5. In case the pitch between the small sow blocks 9 in the dish 1 isS, see figure 3, then the pitch of the holes 20 is 2S. This is also the pitch of the greater sow blocks 18. Below the holes 20 downcomer pipes 21 can be provided that open above the cavities 18a in the greater sow blocks. These downcomer pipes, however, are not necessary. In case two cross rows each with four sow blocks 18 are filled with sixteen sow blocks 9 then the plunger 19 moves the sow blocks 18 in the direction of the arrow C along a distance 8S. In this way always sixteen smaller sow blocks 9 are transferred in the greater sow blocks 18. The filled sow blocks 18 then are removed from the conveyor device and positioned to let the plants grow further. This is not shown. Transverse to the conveyor 14 two plungers 22 and 23 are provided that are able to push a dish 1 out of the related container 2. The plunger 22 pushes the dish 1 completely out of the container 2. The dish 1 then is in the position as shown in figure 5. From figure 5 appears that the sow blocks 9 cannot fall from the table 16 by the fact that holes 3 in which the sow blocks are positioned, are not in one line with the holes 20 in the table 16. With the aid of plunger 24 the dish 1 is moved to the left along a distance iS, from the position according to figure 5, by which the position according to figure 6a is obtained, after which sixteen sow blocks 9 fall through sixteen holes 20 into the cavities 18a of the Subsequently, the dish 1 is moved by the plunger 24 further to the ieft along a distance S to a position according to figure 6b. In the meantime sixteen subsequent sow blocks 18 are moved along a distance 8S and are positioned below the table 16. Now again sixteen sow blocks 9 fall down. Subsequently, the dish 1 is moved forwardly by the plunger 25, that is positioned below the conveyor 14 along a distance S from the position according to figure 6b to the position according to figure 6c. Herewith again sixteen sow blocks 9 fall down. Finally, the dish 1 is again moved to the right over a distanceS from the position of figure 6c to the position of figure 6d with the aid of the plunger 24. The plunger 24 is performed to make iS and S strokes, so it is a double plunger. In this way sixty four sow blocks 9 are transferred from dish 1 to the sow blocks 18. The dish 1 is now emptied for 2 3. In the meantime the next combination 1, 2 has arrived on the position in front of table 16 and pushed over half the length by plunger 23 out of the container 2. Now 1 3 of the first dish 1 and 1 3 of the second dish 1 have to be freed from sow blocks 9. For this reason the second dish 1 has to be pushed over half the length by the plunger 23 completely out of the container 2 by which the first dish is taken along. The other movements are the same as described above. To be able to push the dish 1 out of the container 2 in the upstanding back wall 6 of the container 2 recesses are provided , see figure 4, in order that the plungers 22 and 23 are able to grip dish 1. With the method and the device according to the invention the transplanting can be mechanized completely. The plungers are pneumatic or hydraulic plungers which can be obtained on the market and which are controlled in a known manner. It will be clear that also electric means are suitable to perform the several movements.
