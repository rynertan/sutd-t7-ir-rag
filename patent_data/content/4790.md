# Catalyst component for use in alpha olefin polymerization and use thereof.

## Abstract
A supported titanium catalyst component for use in propylene polymerization is prepared by copulverizing a mixture of magnesium dichloride, titanium tetrachloride ethylbenzoate 1 1 adduct and hexachloroethane for 20 to 44 hrs. Polymerization of propylene with the catalyst composed of the said supported titanium catalyst component and organo aluminum catalyst component, which is prepared by 5 minutes mixing triiso butyl aluminum, and ethylbenzoate gives high catalyst efficiency and HI.
