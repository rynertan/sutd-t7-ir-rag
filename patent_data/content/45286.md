# ELECTRONIC INDICATOR OF ABSORBED CURRENT, EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF A PREFIXED LIMIT, THE EXCEEDING OF WHICH ACTIVATES AN ACOUSTIC ALARM

## Abstract
The invention consists of an electronic device which gives visual indication of the electric current absorbed by a use expressed as a percentage of a prefixable maximum value, set by the user. If the absorbed current this maximum value, an acoustic signal is activated. The user, so warned, can reduce the load before the normal magnetothermal overload circuit breaker inter vene, with a delay depending on the amount of overload, and interrupt the current supply.
