# Signal control system for a time division speech network.

## Abstract
A digital pad switch DSP is inserted in a highway JHW₁, JHW₂ of the time division speech network. For an input signal, from incoming highway JHW₁, the digital pad switch DSP is operable to send out, on outgoing highway JHW₂, any selected one of the following a signal the same as the input signal, sig nals corresponding to the input signal as attenuated by prede termined amounts, and a zero level signal. The digital pad switch has read only memories ROM₀, ROM₃, R0M₅, ROM₆ and ROM . Each ROM has an address corresponding to each possible input signal. In response to the input signal ROM₀ sends out an identical signal, ROM₃, ROM₅ and ROM₆ send out respective signals corresponding to the input signal as attenuated by 3 dB, 5 dB and 6 dB respec tively. ROM sends out a zero level signal. Under control of pad switch control memory PSM the se lector SEL sends out only the signal from the appropriate ROM to highway JHW₂.
