# Solid fuel stove.

## Abstract
A stove for burning solid fuel such as wood, coal or briquets in a more efficient manner utilizes preheated outside air for primary and secondary combustion and has tempered glass windows 14,29 for observation. The combustion air flow is directed so as to minimize obscuring of the glass by deposits of unburned volatiles. A fire chamber 49 is provided with self feeding grate 32 , and the stove also has a secon dary grate 45 , a high proportion of radiating and convective surfaces, a heat exchanger 19 , a cooking surface 24 , an automatic linkage between a fuel loading door 13 and an opening reducing damper 53 to limit back drafts and ther mostatic control to ensure complete combustion and efficient heat exchange. The self feeding grate has a thermostatic grate shaker to promote unattended complete combustion, and can be replaced to match the fuel used.
