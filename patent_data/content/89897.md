# A method for inducing superplastic properties in nonsuperplastic metal and alloy powders.

## Abstract
A method for inducing superplastic properties in non superplastic materials, metals or alloys thus enabling to form them into a desired shape through extrusion or molding at much lower temperatures and pressures. The method of the invention comprises the steps of mixing 10 in powder form the nonsuperplastic material with a second alloy having superplastic characteristics, of compacting 12 the powder mixture into a billet, and of superplastically forming 14 said billet the grain boundaries of the nonsuperplastic material are subsequently restored by heating 16 of the formed billet to a temperature slightly below the melting point of the second alloy. For use in combination with powder metallurgy techni ques.
