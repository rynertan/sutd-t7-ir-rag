## Description
The application relates to a hydrogenation catalyst containing nickel and alumina, as well as to thepreparation and use thereof. Catalysts containing nickel alumina are known and are mainly applied for the preparation ofmethane containing gas. It is usual to prepare such catalysts by co precipitating nickel and alumium ionsfrom a solution with an alkaline reagent like, e.g., ammonium carbonate is as disclosed in US A 3320 182 Esso Research . According to this co precipitation method, catalysts are obtained which have reasonably goodproperties, but the filterability of the catalyst precursor green cake and catalytic properties, particularly inthe hydrogenation of unsaturated triglyceride oils, are inadequate. The BET total surface area of thesecatalysts is typically below 200 m Furthermore Applied Catalysis, 7 1983 , p. 85 90, Doesburg, Hakvoort, Schaper and Professor vanReyen discloses a nickel alumina catalyst confining 0.3 g Al The present invention provides a novel nickel alumina catalyst satisfying the following combination offeatures The atomic ratio of nickel to aluminium of these catalysts is between 10 and 4 because thisresults in a higher hydrogenation selectivity of the catalyst i.e. less formation of completely saturatedtriglycerides which is probably due to a higher average mesopore size. Further these catalysts preferably have an open, porous structure with macropores of 100 500nanometers and mesopores having an average size between 8 and 20 nanometers. As is apparent fromelectronmicroscopy the macropores are formed by interconnected catalyst platelets. The BETtotal surface area is usually between 90 and 450 m The above mentioned improved catalysts can be prepared by a process in which aninsoluble nickel compound is precipitated from an aqueous solution of a nickel salt with an excess alkalineprecipitating agent, which precipitate is subsequently allowed to mature in suspended form and is thencollected, spray dried and reduced, wherein, after the nickel ions have been precipitated, a soluble aluminiumcompound is added. The soluble aluminium compound can be added as a solution but also as undissolvedcrystals. The soluble aluminium compound being added after the nickel ions have been substantiallyprecipitated is e.g. aluminium nitrate, sodium aluminate or alumina which dissolves at least partly in theexcess alkali. After precipitation and maturing according to the invention, the precipitate is separated from the liquid,usually washed, spray dried and activated with hydrogen at an elevated temperature, this by usual procedures. Nickel compounds which can be used as starting material for the catalysts according to this inventionare water soluble nickel compounds such as nitrate, sulphate, acetate, chloride and formate. The solutionswhich are charged to the precipitation reactor preferably contain between 10 and 80 g nickel per litre especially preferred are solutions which contain between 25 and 60 g nickel per litre. Alkaline precipitation agents which can be used as starting material for the catalysts according to thepresent invention are alkali metal hydroxides, alkali metal carbonate, alkali metal bicarbonate, thecorresponding ammonium compounds and mixtures of the above mentioned compounds. Theconcentration of the alkaline solution which is fed into the precipitation reactor is preferably between 20and 300 g alkaline material calculated as anhydrous material per litre in as far as the solubility allowsthis , more particularly between 50 and 250 g per litre. It is convenient to use both solutions of metal salt and alkaline compound in almost the sameconcentrations expressed in equivalents , so that approximately the same volumes can be reacted. The metal containing solution and the alkaline solution are added in such amounts per unit of time thata small excess of alkaline compound is present during the precipitation step, so that the normality of theliquid is between 0.05 and 0.5, preferably between 0.1 and 0.3 this normality is determined by titrating asolution of hydrochloric acid, with methyl orange as indicator . Sometimes it is necessary to add somemore alkaline solution during the maturing step, in order to keep the normality within the range indicatedabove. The precipitation reactor has such dimensions with respect to the amounts of liquid pumped in, that short average residence times can be obtained. As a rule, average residence times of between 0.1 sec. and10 minutes, preferably between 0.2 sec. and 4.5 minutes are used in the precipitation reactor. In a preferred embodiment, in which the precipitation step step 1 is carried out continuously, theamounts of solutions fed into the precipitation reactor are controlled by measuring, optionallycontinuously, the normality or pH of the reactor effluent. The temperature at which the precipitation takes place can be controlled by adjusting the temperaturesof the liquids fed in. The required vigorous agitation of the liquid in the precipitation reactor preferablytakes place with a mechanical energy input of between 5 and 2000 watts per Kg of solution. More preferablythe agitation takes place with a mechanical energy input of 100 to 2000 watts per kg of solution. The reaction mixture obtained from the precipitation reactor preferably goes within 15 minutes to astirred post reactor of a significantly higher capacity in which the suspension is agitated and matured. Atthis stage soluble aluminium, compounds and possible other compounds are added, and optionally carriermaterial and promoters if any. The amount of aluminium compound added is 0.1 to0.25 mol aluminium ions per gram atom of nickel in the suspension. Preferably, a soluble compound suchas aluminium nitrate or sodium aluminate is added. Preferably the liquid in the ageing reactor, thus duringthe maturing step, is kept at a temperature between 40 and 100 C, preferably between 60 and 98 C. The precipitation step and also the maturing step can be carried out batchwise discontinuously ,continuously and semi continuously e.g. according to the Cascade method . Preferably the precipitation is carried out continuously by dosing an aqueous metal salt solution andan alkaline precipitating agent solution together in a small, vigorously agitated mixing device andthereafter pumping the suspension into one or more post reactors. Usually the normality of the liquid in the maturing reactor during the ageing step step 2 is kept in thesame range as during the precipitation step step 1 if necessary by adding some more alkali. The maturingstep can be carried out in one or more reactors, the total average residence time being maintainedbetween 20 and 180 minutes, preferably between 30 and 150 minutes. If two or more reactors are used, it ispreferred to have the temperature in the second or further reactor 5 to 15 centigrades lower than in thepreceding maturing reactor. After the ageing step has been completed, the solid material is separated from the mother liquor,usually washed, spray dried, optionally ground and calcined and thereafter activated with hydrogen at atemperature, between 250 and 600, preferably between 350 and 500 C. This activation can take place atatmospheric pressure or at increased pressure. The present process involving separate precipitation and ageing steps results in a catalystprecursor green cakes which has a considerably improved filterability than a co precipitated precursor atleast a four fold improvement. Preferably before spray drying, or during a step preceding that, promoters can beadded. Suitable amounts of promoters are from 0.5 to 10 , calculated on the weight of nickel, of elementssuch as molybdenum, cobalt, copper, iron, lanthanum, magnesium, or other elements and combinationsthereof. The solid material is preferably washed with water sometimes some alkaline material or a surfaceactive material is added to the washing water. Also an organic solvents e.g. acetone can be advantageouslyused during washing. Drying preferably takes place with hot air. The catalyst thus obtained is especially suitable for the hydrogenation of unsaturated organiccompounds particularly oils, fats, fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives like nitriles. This hydrogenation iscarried out with hydrogen at an increased temperature 80 250 C and optionally an increased pressure 0.1 5.0 10 The hydrogenated products thus obtained, e.g. hydrogenated oils, show favourable properties such aslow tri saturated content, sometimes combined with a steep dilatation curve. The invention is illustrated by the following examples Solutions of Ni NO The pH of the suspension in the second reactor was 9.0. The volume of the liquid in the second reactorwas kept constant. In Table I this is tabulated. The maturing step was terminated after 90 min. 3 the average residence time , and the suspension inthe reactor filtered. The green filter cake thus obtained was washed with distilled water. The washed cakewas The filterability of the green cake was determined as follows The activity of the catalyst in the hydrogenation of fish oil iodine value 165 was determined asfollows As to the selectivity of the catalyst 250 g fish oil iodine value 165 were hydrogenated to an iodinevalue of 85 with 0.1 w.w. catalyst and 60 litres H The oil filtration of the catalyst was determined as follows After the hydrogenation the suspension, i.e. the hydrogenated oil containing the catalyst, was cooledto 90 C and pumped to a closed, double walled filtration vessel which was connected to a thermostat at90 C. The bottom of this vessel contained a cotton filter cloth of 30 cm diameter. After pumping the oil andthe catalyst into the filtration vessel an overpressure of 3.10 In accordance with the procedure described in Example 1, more catalysts according to the inventionwere prepared, variations being made, however, in the amounts of starting materials and conditions, asindicated in Table I below. The properties of these catalysts are summarized in Table II. It is noteworthy that on an average, short hydrogenation times could be used and the catalyst retainedits activity for a prolonged period when compared with a co precipitated catalyst. An excellent selectivitywas also observed, i.e. there was less tri saturated triglyceride formed especially in the hydrogenation ofsoya bean oil. Further, the melting point of the hydrogenated oils appeared to be practically independent ofthe atomic ratio of Al to Ni and of the conditions of washing and drying. Finally, also the filtration propertiesof green cake and catalyst after hydrogenation were particularly favourable. The procedure followed was identical to that of Example 1. In this case solutions of NiSO The preparation was carried out according to Example 1. In this case a solution of aluminium nitrate inwater was dosed into the precipitation reactor. The results are tabulated in Tables V and VI. Herein the hydrogenation of C18 nitrile to amine is described. The catalyst was prepared according toExample 2. The reaction was carried out in an autoclave of 200 ml, charged with 70 ml nitrile acid value 0.2 and amount of catalyst corresponding with 0.12 Ni at a hydrogen pressure of 2.5 10 The temperature was 110 C at the start of the reaction and increased to 120 C due to the heat ofreaction and maintained for 2.5 hours. The ratio H The selectivity and rate of filtration of the spent catalyst were higher than those which were obtainedafter hydrogenation with the catalyst according to Comparative Experiment 2. The catalyst prepared according to Example 6 was tested in the hydrogenation of soybean oil. In aso called loop jet reactor soybean oil IV 132 was hydrogenated using 0.02 w.w. of Ni, at a hydrogenpressure of 6.10 The same catalyst as used in Example 8 was tested in the hydrogenation of rapeseed oil IV 117.5 . In aso called BUSS trade name reactor rapeseed oil was hydrogenated using 0.05 w.w. Ni at a hydrogenpressure of 4.10
