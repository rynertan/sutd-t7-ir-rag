## Description
REACTIVE DYES This invention relates to reactive dyes in particular to such dyes of the triphenodioxazine series. UK Patent 1450746 describes a valuable class of triphenodioxazine dyestuffs including reactive dyes. We have now discovered that a novel sub class of the dyes described in UK 1450746 has unexpected and valuable properties. These dyes are characterised by having triazinyl or pyrimidinyl groups to which sulphonic acid groups are attached. Notwithstanding that it would be expected that the sulphonic acid groups could contribute to the water solubility of the dyestuffs, the solubilities of the dyes of the invention are unexpectedly high e.g. they may be several fold greater than the corresponding chlorotriazinyl or dichloropyrimidinyl dyes. The new dyes are thus valuable for the manufacture of concentrated aqueous solutions which are desirable to avoid the various hazards associated with the handling of dusty dyestuff powders. According to the present invention, there are provided triphenodioxazine dyes which in the free acid form are dyes of the formula EMI1.1 wherein Q represents a cellulose reactive group of the formula EMI2.1 B represents an optionally substituted alkoxy, optionally substituted phenylamino or sulphonated naphthylamino radical D represents C1 or CN A represents a C2 C6 alkylene group optionally substituted by OH or OSO3H and R represents H or C1 4 alkyl optionally substituted by CN, SO3H, COOH, OH or OSO3H. The preferred dyes of formula 1 have one or more of the following features. 1 A is CH2CH2 , CH2CHCH3 , CH2CH2CH2 , CH2CHOHCH2 or CH2CH OSO3H CH2 . 2 R is CH3S C2H5, beta carboxyethyl, beta hydroxyethyl, beta cyanoethyl or omega sulphomethyl and especially H. 3 Q is a disulphopyrimidinyl radical in which D is cyano or a sulphotriazinyl radical in which B is C1 4 alkoxy optionally substituted by C1 4 alkoxy and especially naphthylamino substituted by 1, 2 or 3 SO3H and optionally substituted phenylamino of the formula EMI2.2 where G H, methyl, ethyl, omega sulphomethyl, beta carboxy , beta hydroxy or beta cyanoethyl and Z and X are each independently selected from H, C00H, SO3H, CH3, C2H5, OCH3, OC2H5, C1, Br, CN, NO2,NHCOCH3 or beta sulphatoethylsulphonyl. Especially preferred groups of formula 2 are those in which Z is SO3H and X is CH3, OCH3 and especially H or S03H. As specific examples of the groups B there may be mentioned methoxy ethoxy beta methoxyethoxy beta ethoxyethoxy o , m or p sulphoanilino o , m and p carboxyanilino 4 and 5 sulpho 2 carboxyanilino 4 and 5 sulpho o tolylamino 2,4 , 2,5 and 3,5 disulphoanilino 2,4 dicarboxyanilino 4 and 5 sulpho 2 methoxyanilinoN methyl o , m and p sulphoanilinoN omega sulphomethylanilinoN beta hydroxyethyl 3 sulphoanilino. The dyes of formula 1 may be manufactured by reacting dyestuffs of the formula EMI3.1 EMI4.1 where A, R, B and D have the meanings given above and hal i8 F, Br or especially C1, with a metal sulphite in aqueous solution. This reaction is usually carried out at a temperature in the range 20 1000C. The metal sulphite is conveniently an alkali metal sulphite such as sodium sulphite. The dyes of formula 1 may also be manufactured by reacting a compound of the formula EMI4.2 wherein B and D have the meanings given above with a metal sulphite in aqueous solution and reacting the resulting sulphonated triazine or pyrimidine compound in aqueous solution with a triphenodioxazine compound of the formula EMI5.1 wherein A and R have the meanings given above. Thus, a dichlorotriazine compound may be reacted with aqueous sodium sulphite at about 0 C, the resulting solution of disulphotriazine compound then being reacted with a triphenodioxazine compound of formula 5 at a slightly higher temperature, for example 5 150C. Similarly, trichlorocyanopyrimidine or tetrachloropyrimidine may be reacted with aqueous sodium sulphite at about 0 50C in the presence of a triphenodioxazine compound of formula 5 . The halotriazinyl dye of formula 3 may be obtained by methods described in UK 1450746 and the pyrimidinyl analogues may be obtained similarly. The dyes of formula 1 may be isolated by any conventional means as spray drying or salting out. The dyes may also be used without isolation and isolated dyes may be redissolved in aqueous solvent without drying to avoid the dust problems of dry dyestuffs powders. The original reaction media.or the solutions of redissolved dyes may be purified by removal of inorganic salts by membrane techniques such as reverse osmosis. The sulphonic acid groups shown in the free acid form in formula 1 will usually be present in the form of salts e.g. sodium salts. The dyestuffs of the present invention may be used for colouring a wide range of textile materials containing hydroxyl or amino groups, e.g. wool, silk, synthetic polyamides and natural or regenerated cellulose, for example cotton or viscose rayon materials, by conventional methods used for colouring such materials with water soluble reactive dyes, e.g. in the case of cellulose they are preferably applied in conjunction with a treatment with an acid binding agent, e.g. caustic soda, sodium carbonate, phosphate, silicate or bicarbonate, which may be applied to the cellulose textile materials before, during or after the application of the dyestuff. The dyes of the present invention are valuable reactive dyes for cellulose. They yield coloured textiles with good resistance to washing and light and are usually characterised by good strength and an ability to build up to high depths of shade. They have high levels of water solubility and may be handled and stored as aqueous solutions at mildly acid to neutral pH values. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples in which all parts and percentages are by weight. The term MI indicates the weight of the material containing one mole of pure compound.Example 1 To 137 parts of 3,10 bis 4 chloro 6 2 ,4 disulpho anilino s triazin 2 ylaminoethylamino 6,13 dichloro 4,11 disulphotriphenodioxazine MI.2740 in 1500 parts of water were added 75.6 parts of sodium sulphite.
