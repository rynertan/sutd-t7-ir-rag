## Description
PRODUCTION OF MONOACYLPYRAZINES BACKGROUND OF TISE INVENTION Unlike alkylpyrazines which are ubiquitous in nature and heat treated foodstuffs, acylpyrazines are more limited in their occurrence. For example, 2 acetyl 5methylpyrazine and 2 acetyl 5 ethylpyrazine are reported as constituents of cocoa in Tobacco International, page 18ff March 1979 , and l 2 pyrazinyl l butanone is tentatively identified as a water soluble component of cigarette smoke in 3. Agric. Food Chem., 25 2 , 310 1977 . Several acetylpyrazines are included in the F.E.M.A.listing of food additives as being useful for imparting a popcorn nutty flavor to a foodstuff. The incorporation of acetylpyrazine, 2 acetyl 5 methylpyrazine or 2 acetyl 6methylpyrazine as a popcorn like flavorant in foodstuffs and tobacco is described in U.S. 3,402,051. Interest in substituted pyrazines such as acylpyrazines as flavorants in food stuffs and tobacco has stimulated the investigation of synthesis methods for the preparation of this useful class of heterocyclic compounds. U.S. 3,711,482 describes a process for preparing 2 acetyl 3 alkylpyrazine which involves reacting 2 ethyl 3alkylpyrazine with N bromosuccinimide to provide 2 1 bromoethyl 3 alkylpyrazine,and then treating the bromoethylalkylpyrazine with an alkali metal and 2 nitroprcpane to yield 2 ccetyl 3 alkylpyrazine. U.S. 3,767,428 describes a process for preparing 2 acetyl 3 ethylpyrazine which involves reacting 2,3 diethylpyrazine with peracetic acid in an acetic acid medium at 70 800C to provide 2 ethyl 3 l acetoxyethyl pyrazine.Treatment of this intermediate product with potassium hydroxide yields 2 ethyl 3 l hydroxyethyl pyrazine, which is subsequently oxidized with dimethylsulfoxide and acetic anhydride to give the desired 2 acetyl 3 ethylpyrazine. U.S. 3,890,320 describes a process for preparing 2 acyl 3 alkylpyrazines which involves treating 2 alkyl 3alkylpyrazine with an alkali metal dichromate in an acidic medium, and recovering 2 acyl 3 alkylpyrazine product. U.S. 3,914,227 describes a process which involves reacting methylpyrazine anion with 2 ethylcyclohexylbromide to provide a 2 2 ethylcyclohexyl methylpyrazine intermediate product, and then admixing the intermediate product withN bromosuccinimide, carbon tetrachloride and benzoylperoxide to produce cyclohexyl pyrazine ketone. In J. Chem. Soc., Perkin II, 2035 1972 there is reported the acylation of protonated pyrazine derivatives. In a general procedure, a heteroaromatic compound e.g., pyrazine is acylated by reacting the.compound with alkanal in the presence of t butyl hydroperoxide and iron II sulfate in a homogeneous aqueous medium of acetic acid and sulfuric acid. Under these conditions, the hetr roaromatic compound is polyacylated to yield the following type of pyrazine derivative EMI3.1 The diacyl derivative is readily obtained with an excess of acylating agent, whereas the monoacyl derivatives prevail only at very low conversions. Hence, the methods developed for the production of monoacylpyrazine derivatives involve either cumbersome oxidative conversion of alkylpyrazines, or acylation of pyrazines under low conversion conditions. Accordingly, it is àn object of this invention to provide a general and efficient process for selective acylation of pyrazines to monoacyl derivatives. It is another object of this invention to provide novel monoacyl pyrazine compounds which have aroma and flavor characteristics which range from a low butterscotch note to sweet and cheesy. Other objects and advantages of the present invention shall become apparent from the accompanying description and examples. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION One or more objects of the present invention are accomplished by the provision of a process for preparing monoacylpyrazines which comprises the steps of 1 providing a heterogeneous reaction medium consisting of a waterimmiscible organic phase and an acidic aqueous phase, wherein the organic phase comprises a mixture of an aldehyde compound RCHO and a pyrazine compound corresponding to the formula EMI4.1 where R1, R2 and R3 are substituents selected from hydrogen and alkyl groups, and R1 and R2 when taken together with connectingEMI4.2 elementsssform an alicyclic or aromatic structure, and R in the aldehyde compound is a substituent selected froin aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic groups 2 maintaining efficient contact between the organic and aqueous phases for a period of time sufficient to achieve acylation of the pyrazine compound in the presence of a free radical generating agent and 3 recovering a monoacylpyrazine product corresponding to the formula EMI5.1 where R, R1, R2 and R3 are substituents as previously defined. The aldehyde R CHO reactant can be any compound which does not contain any substituents which inhibit or prevent the free radical interaction of the aldehyde functionality with the pytazine nucleus. It is preferred that the aldehyde reactant is at least partially soluble in the aqueous phase of the acylation system, in order to increase the rate and efficiency of the acylation reaction. Illustrative of radicals corresponding to R in the above formula are organic substituents containing between about 1 12 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, butenyl, isobutyl, pentyl, octyl, decyl, chloroethyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyclohexenyl, phenyl, chlorophenyl, methoxyphenyl, tolyl, xylyl, naphthyl, furyl, thienyl, and the like. Illustrative of suitable pyrazine compounds corresponding to the formula above are those in whichRÚ, Rê and R are substituents selected from hydrogen and alkyl groups containing between about 1 8 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, isobutyl, tertiary butyl, pentyl, and the like. When taken together with connecting elements,R1 and R2 can form an alicyclic or aromatic structure. Illustrative of this type of pyrazine derivative are quinoxaline and 5,6,7,8 tetrahydroquinoxaline EMI6.1 The pyrazine and aldehyde reactants can be employed over a wide range of molar ratios. It has been found convenient and advantageous to employ a molar ratio between about 0.5 10 1 of aldehyde to pyrazine in the acylation system. It is an essential aspect of the invention process that the acylation system is heterogeneous, i.e., the acylation medium is composed of a water immiscible organic phase in intimate contact with an acidic aqueous phase. Efficient contact of the two phases is achieved by suitable means of stirring or agitation. The organic phase usually will comprise a mixture of the pyrazine and aldehyde reactants. If the watersolubility of the pyrazine and aldehyde reactants are at a sufficiently high level to prevent the maintenance of separate organic and aqueous phases, then suitable modification of the acylation system is required to accomplish the separation of phases. Cooling of the acylation system is one means of providing the desired phase separation, particularly in combination with other means such as salting of the aqueous phase. A preferred alternative is to include a waterimmiscible solvent in the system, such as hexane, benzene or toluene. The relative volumes of the respective immiscible phases in the acylation system are not critical, and typically the two phases will be approximately equal in volume. The acidity of the aqueous phase is provided by the addition of a suitable acid reagent such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. The pH of the aqueous phase is below about 6, and preferably is in the range between about 1 5. The acylation reaction between the pyrazine and aldehyde reactants is catalyzed by the inclusion of a free radical generating agent, in a quantity between about 1 50 weight percent, based on the weight of aldehyde reactant. Illustrative of suitable free radical initiators are hydrogen peroxide alkali metal or ammonium persulfates, perborates, peracetates and percarbonates organic peroxides and hydroperoxides such as benzoyl peroxide, t butylhydroperoxide and diisopropylperoxydicarbonate and the like. The initiator may be associated with activating means e.g., a redox system which involves the use of compounds such as sulfites and thiosulfites, and redox reaction promoters such as transition metal ions e.g., Fe . In a typical procedure the monoacylation reaction is conducted for a time period between about 0.2 2 hours with efficient stirring of the heterogeneous phases. Atmospheric pressure is usually employed and the temperature of the monoacylation is maintained in the range between about 00 600C. After the completion of the reaction, the monoacylpyrazine product is recovered by conventional procedures. If a water immiscible solvent is employed during the monoacylation reaction, the solvent containing organic phase is separated and then fractionated by distillation to recover monoacylpyrazine product. Preferably, the organic phase is washed with aqueous alkaline solution before the distillation. The separate aqueous phase is extracted with a solvent, and after the solvent extract phase is washed with aqueous alkaline solution, the solvent extract phase is distilled to yield an additional quantity of monoacylpyrazine product. If no organic solvent is employed as a water inmiscible diluent during the monoacylation reaction period, then recovery of monoacylpyrazine product can be accomplished, for example, by extracting the resultant heterogeneous phase reaction product mixture with a water immiscible solvent, followed by washing the solvent extract phase with aqueous alkaline solution, and distilling the solvent extract under vacuum to isolate the desired monoacylpyrazine product. The said product can be further subjected to purification techniques, such as distillation, preparative gas liquid chromatography, thick layer chromatography or crystallization as appropriate for a particular monoacylpyrazine product. The following examples are further illustrative of the present invention. The reactants and other specific ingredients are presented as being typical, and various modifications can be devised in view of the foregoing disclosure within the scope of the invention.

EXAMPLE XII This Example illustrates the preparation of 2,5 dipropionylpyrazine in accordance with the procedure described in J. Chem. Soc., Perkins II, 2035 1972 byCoronna et al as disclosed in the Background Of The Invention section of the present specification . A homogeneous solution of propionaldehyde 2.9 grams, 50 mmoles , pyrazine 800 milligrams, 100 mmoles , glacial acetic acid 15 milliliters ,conc. sulfuric acid 3 milliliters and water 15 milliliters is set stirring at 30C. To this solution is added a solution of 5.56 grams of ferrous sulfate 20 mmole in 10 milliliters of water followed by the rapid addition of 2.56 grams of 70 t butylhydroperoxide 20 mmole . After 5 minutes, a small amount of solid is noted on the surface of the reaction medium. The reaction is stirred for a total of 1 hour, during which time the reaction temperature is allowed to rise to 150C. The solid product is isolated by filtration through a sintered glass funnel to give about 950 milligrams of 50 pure product. Purification by crystallization from hexane provided 150 milligrams of pure diacylproduct. The yield was calculated to be 25 based on the crude product.Anal. calc. for CloHl2N202 C, 62.48 H, 6.29 N, 14.58 Found C, 62.75 H, 6.33 N, 14.81 A negligible amount of the monoacyl product c1 was obtained by neutralizing the filtrate with 108 sodium hydroxide and extracting with methylene chloride. EXAMPLE XIII This Example illustrates the product selectivity advantage of conducting a pyrazine acylation reaction in a heterogeneous reaction medium as compared to a homogeneous system for the production of l pyrazinyl l propanone. The reaction described in Example Il is repeated employing a longer reaction time total of 2 hours . An identical reaction is run with the exception that 40 milliliters of benzene are added prior to the addition of the ferrous sulfate and t butylhydroperoxide. After 2 hours the benzene layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with 2 x 50 milliliters of methylene chloride. Each organic phase is dried MgSO4 and concentrated at reduced pressure. The benzene phase yields 0.65 gram of crude product, and the methylene chloride extract phase yields 0.1 gram of crude product. In comparison, the weight of crude product from the reaction without benzene is 1.6 grams. Analysis of the crude products by GC SE 30 column indicates that the amount of l pyrazinyl l propanone is nearly identical for each reaction. The reaction without benzene gives a significant amount of diacylation ratio of mono to diacylation 6 1 . In contrast, the ratio for the reaction run in the presence of benzene is 50 1. The conversion demonstrates that the heterogeneous medium provides substantially monoacylation, whereas the homogeneous reaction conditions produce diacylation almost exclusively as consistent with the results in Example XII .
