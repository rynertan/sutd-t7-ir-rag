# NUTATING PISTON PUMP

## Abstract
A rotary pump having an eccentric rotor 14 adapted to effect eccentric motion relative to the axis of the pump shaft 7 within a pump casing 1 to cause pumping action in a pump chamber. The pump comprises a pump casing 1 , a pump shaft 7 mounted on the pump casing, a pair of eccentric rotors 14 mounted on the pump shaft 7 with angular spacing apart of 180 , a pair of diaphragms 24 on the eccentric rotors 14 to define a pair of pump chambers P, a partition member 36 adapted to divide the pump chamber into a suction chamber Pi and an exhaust chamber Pe , and an intake port 42 and an exhaust port 43 in communica tion with the suction and exhaust chambers, respectively, the intake port being cut off from its communication with the exhaust port by the partition member during rotation of the pump shaft.
