## Description
SKIN CONDITIONING COMPOSITIONS The present invention relates to novel skin condi toning compositions which form a very water occlusive film on skin thereby reducing moisture loss from the skin surface. The treatment of human skin with various agents has been undertaken for many years with the goal being to keep the skin in a smooth and supp1e 2COndition. Skin has the tendency to dry out when exposed to condi tions of low humidity or to extended periods in a detergent solution. From a biochemical standpoint, dryness is a measure of the water content of the skin. Under normal conditions, the water content and vapor pressure of the epidermis are higher than those of the surrounding air with consequent evaporation of water from the skin surface. Skin becomes dry because of the excessive loss of water from the surface and the subsequent loss of water from the stratum corneum. Continuous and prolonged immersion in soap or deter gent solutions may contribute to dryness of the stratum corneum. The reason for this is that the surfactant medium promotes dissolution of the skin surface lipids, the horny layer lipids, and the dissolution of the hygroscopic water soluble Components in the corneum. To alleviate the aforementioned conditions, emollient creams as described in Sagarin, CosmeticsScience and Technology, 2nd Edition, Vol. 1, WileyInterscience 1972 have been recommended for application to the skin. The emollient materials probably increase the state of hydration of the corneous layer of the skin by altering the rate of diffusion of water from the lower epidermal and dermal layers, the rate of evaporation of water from the skin s surface, and the ability of the corneous layer to hold moisture. Numerous other references have disclosed the use of a wide variety of materials for alleviating the problems of dry skin. Included among such references are those in which long chain esters of the type used in the compositions of the present invention have been disclosed. U.S. Patent 3,959,491, May 25, 1976 toYoung et al discloses a milk based cosmetic which may contain esters such as dodecyl stearate and other components including fatty acids and emulsifiersTechnical Bulletins SG 0202 and SG 0211 distributed byScher Chemicals, Inc. have also disclosed skin treat ment compositions containing long chain esters, alco hols and surfactants.However, none of these references teach or suggest the invention as set forth herein DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to superior skin conditioning cempositons comprisi2ig from about 0.1 to about lG of a long chain alkyl ester of a fatty acid, an emollict an an amount such that the amount of long chain alkyl ester and the emollient is from about 0.2t tes about 25 , from about 0.05 to about 8 of an emulsifier and the remainder water. The materials from which the emulsifier and the emollient may be selected are discussed below. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION It has been discovered that compositions comprising the above generally described components possess superior occlusive properties4 The compositions, in addition to their occlusiveness, possess good cosmetics. The individual components are described in detail below. LONG CHAIN ALKYL ESTER OF A FATTY ACID The ester component of the compositions of the present invention has the structureEMI3.1 wherein R1 and R2 are both straight chain alkyls having from about 6 to about 22 carbon atoms and the total rum ber of carbon atoms in the ester is at least 24.Examples of such esters include lauryl laurate, lauryl rnyristate, myristyl myristate, behenyl caprate, cetearyl palmitate, behenyl stearate. Esters having a total number of carbon atoms in excess of 28 are preferred.Cetearyl palmitate and cetyl stearate are most preferred esters. There are, of course, many other esters which meet the above described requirements and are suitable for use in the present compositions. Cetearyl palmitate is defined in the CTFA Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary, page 55, 2nd edition, edited by N.F. Estrin. Each chain of the ester, as indicated above, may contain from about 6 to about 22 carbon atoms while the total number must be at least 24. Thus ester having substantially unequal numbers of carbon atoms in the two chains are suitable for use in the present compositions. Chains of approximately equal length are, however, preferred. The level of the above esters used in the present compositions is from about 0.1 to about 16 of the total composition, preferably from about 1 to about 8z. The combination of the esters with the other oil phase components is important to the performance of the compositions of the present invention Given below are preferred minimum and maximum levels for certain of the esters expressed as a percentage of the oil phase.CARBON CHAIN LENGTH MINIMUM MAXIMUM C24 64 64 C26 21 64 C28 9.9 64 C30 6.0 64 C32 4.2 64 C34 3.2 35 C36 2.6 23.9 C38 2.3 20.0 C40 2.0 18.2 C42 1.8 17.2 c44 1.7 16.6 Emollient Material The present compositions, in addition to the above described esters, contain an emollient material in an amount such that the amount of ester plus emollient is from about 0.2 to about 25 of the total composition, preferably from about 4 to about 18 . One function of the emollient is to ensure that the ester is plasticized sufficiently to allow it to be in a film like state on the skin.The emollient in the present compositions is selected from the group consisting of fatty alcohols, squalane, liquid or solid paraffins, mixtures of fatty acids and squalane, mixtures of fatty acids and liquid or solid paraffins and mixtures thereof. The particular emollient selected depends in part on the particular ester selected since proper plasticization, as indicated above, is desired. The emollient for the esters having more than 28 carbon atoms is preferably selected from the group consisting of squalane, liquid or solid paraffins and mixtures of fatty alcohols with squalane or paraffins. Typical fatty alcohols and fatty acids useful in the present compositions include those having from 12 22 carbon atoms such as cetyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, stearic acid and palmitic acid. Paraffins include, for example, mineral oil, petrolatum and paraffin wax.Emulsifier An emulsifier in an amount of from about0.05 to about 8 , preferably from about 0.25 to about 5 It, is included in the compositions of the present invention to emulsify the oil components. The emulsifier is selected from the group consisting of polyethoxylated fatty acids having less than about 30 moles of ctllylene oxide per mole of fatty acid, unethoxylated sugar esters, polyoxyethylene fatty ether phosphates, fatty acid amides, phospholipids, polypropoxylated fatty ethers, acyl lactylates and mixtures thereof. Examples of such emulsifiers include polyoxyethylene 8 stearate, methyl glucoside sesquistearate, sucrose distearate, sucrose laurate, sorbitan monolaurate, polyoxyethylene 32 oleyl ether phosphate, polyoxyethylene 10 oleyl ether phosphate, lauric diethanolamide, stearic monoethanolamide, lecithin, lanolin alcohol propoxylates, sodium stearoyl 2 lactylate and calcium stearoyl 2 lactylate. Preferred emulsifiers are the polyethoxylated fatty acids having less than about 30 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of fatty acid and the acyl lactylates.Water It is preferred that distilled water be used in the present compositions.Optional Components Oil Phase Components In addition to the long chain esters, emollients and emulsifiers described previously, the present compositions may contain a variety of materials including a Esters not meeting the requirements for the long chain ester such as oleyl oleate, iso stearyl isostearate, isopropyl lanolate, isopropyl myristate, butyl stearate, myristyl lactate and 2 ethyl hexyl palmitate b Oils such as castor oil, jooba oil, cotton seed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil and silicone oils such as dimethyl polysiloxane c Waxes such as ceresin wax, carnuba wax, bees wax and castor wax d Lanolin, its derivatives and components such as acetylated lanolin, lanolin alcohols and lanolin fatty acids.Lanolin fatty acids are described in Re.
