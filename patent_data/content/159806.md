# Apparatus for cooling strip of metals.

## Abstract
The invention relates to apparatus of the kind in which the strip 2 is passed in contact partly around the outer circumfer ences of a number of spaced cooling rolls 1, 1 etc. through which collant passes. In conventional apparatus of this kind numerous problems arise with respect to the limited range of temperature that can be applied, due to the coolant used, and the fact that irregulari ties can occur widthwise of the strip. The invention aims to overcome these problems and is characterized in that temperature detection means 17, 17 etc. are provided for detecting the temperature of the strip 2 before contact with each said cooling roll 1, 1 etc. , in that coolant temperature adjusting means 16 are provided which, in dependence upon the detected temperature Ts1 , are adapted to adjust the temperature of the coolant passing through each cooling roll to a range Tw1 which limits the tem perature drop Tsm such that unacceptable irregularities or distortions in the configuration of the strip cannot occur, and in that the coolant used for each cooling roll is selected with a boiling point appropriate to the respective detected tempera ture for each roll. In a preferred arrangement, further temperature detection means 18 are provided for each cooling roll to detect the tem perature of the coolant and output signals Ts and Tw respec tively from both detection means 17, 18 are inputted to a control 19 for regulating a flow rate valve 16 .
