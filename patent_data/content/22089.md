## Description
A heat recovery system from fluid in circuits at low temperature to circuits at high temperature.The invention relates to a heat recovery system from fluid in circuits at low temperature to circuits at a higher temperature. The tendency of heat loss is noted when the heat is at an equal or lower temperature of the used circuit as happens for instance in driers with discharges of hot, humid air, or in ovens and other such likes with vapour loss, or even in water cooling systems in motors as in the case of generators, etc. for which the result is given that being able to recuperate the heat of these discharges, the production of these installations can be increased.The first scope of this invention is the achievment of a new heat recovery system or apparatus for the recuperation of heat from water or vapour from low temperature circuits to high temperature circuits as explained before.Another scope of the invention is to achieve a system or apparatus in which, with simple means and special devices, recovery of the heat dispersed in the discharges is possible recycling at a higher temperature and this llo its re use without complicated heat pumps and without use of intermediate fluids.The invention claimed consists in a heat recovery system or apparatus for the recovery of heat from a fluid as for example water or vapour from a low temperature primary circuit towards a higher temperature secondary circuit with fluid compression means depending on the temperature difference between said circuits equipped or not with a heat exchanger means, and with an apparatus that can assorb heat through the evaporated fluid in the said primary circuit at low temperature and pressure, to compress the fluid into the said secondary circuit obtaining the increase in temperature, condensation, and possibility to repeat the cycle, being the said higher temperature in the secondary circuit t4 above the point of evaporation of its liquid, at atmospheric pressure, or anyway above the temperature of the said primary circuit, wherein is provided a shunt for the said primary circuit, downstream of utilisation in the said secondary circuit,at a temperature t3 generally lower than boiling point of the said liquid, in relation to the existing pressure in that point of the circuit, and wherein the said shunt brings into an evaporation primary circuit chamber 17 of the said liquid being the evaporation favoured by the depression in the said evaporation chamber, achieved by sucking the evaporated vapours through a pump means 6 that forwards the vapours to condense themselves again in the said secondary circuit s of utilisation increasing the temperature t4 .One way of carrying out the invention is described in detail below with reference to drawings which illustrate two specific embodiments in which Figure 1 is a schematic representation of a drying unit or oven for example in cooking pasta. Figure 2 is a preferably more detailed embodiment in a schematic view of the invention concerning the pri mary and secondary circuits.Figure 1 shows the sucking up of the humidified air vapours of the humidity of the product 1, and said humidified air and vapours are sent by the pump blower 2, under pressure to condensate its humidity in the exchanger 3, and the condensation of water is discharged externally by a shunt pipe 4, while the pressure reducer exhaust valve 5, allows the air to become again non humid in the cycle keeping however in 3 the necessary pressure to obtain the heat exchange allowing it to become reassorbed by the primary circuit going back into 1 favouring the evaporation of more water allowing the repetition of the cycle.Figure 2 shows a container 17 holding water kept at a constant level by a level valve 12 and where a reduced pressure is maintained to boil the water at a certain temperature and in this container a generator 14 intakes the water through a pump for its own cooling system sending through a pressure reducing valve 15 , the water thus heated, to evaporate, therefore cooling itself ready to repeat the cooling cycle of the generator 14 .In this second case, the vapour which forms becomes sucked by the pump 6 with a cooling water system 13 and is forwarded, through a non return valve 7 , to condensate directly for use or, if a heat exchanger is not used, directly into the water of the secondary circuit 8 heating it. The pump 6 can be cooled by an exchanger 13 using the same water of the secondary circuit 8 by starting to transmit to it part of the compressed heat of the pump 6 . Naturally the secondary circuit will be equipped with everything necessary like a circulation pump 9 , an expansion vessel 10 , a charge pump 11 , a valve or a remote control switch of level 16 and so on as a pressure valve, safety valve, air vent, etc.This same system can be used if, from a heating circuit at low temperature there is the necessity to obtain some heat for use at a more high temperature.A further characteristic consists in the fact that the temperatures relieved in the various parts of the installation in figure 2 are t 78 C t2 85 C t3 100 C t4 133 C.
