# System for distributing and making available to the user articles of food, particularly sweets.

## Abstract
A system for making sweets and similar articles of food available to the user. The system comprises a holder 1 adapted to be affixed to e.g. an automobile dashboard, and a package 11 , preferably a blister pack, containing the sweets, and adapted to be slid into the holder so as to rest upon a support 4 . The package can be opened so that the sweets, lying on the support, can be taken out individually. Preferably several unit packs are interconnected and can be separated by perforations or other tearing lines 22, 23 .
