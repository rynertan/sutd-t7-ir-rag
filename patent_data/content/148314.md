## Description
HYDROHALOGENATION OF CONJUGATED DIENES IN THE PRESENCE OF ALCOHOLSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention The invention relates to processes for the hydrohalogenation of conjugated diene hydrocarbonsBrief Description of the Prior Art The literature is replete with descriptions of processes for the hydrohalogenation of conjugated dienes.Representative of such descriptions are those found in theU.S. Patents 2,882,323 and 3,016,408 and in British Patent 896,262 see also German Offenlegungschrift 1,768,544. In the latter patent, hydrohalogenation of butadiene is conducted in the presence of aqueous mixtures including organic amines. The reaction mixtures are corrosive and in some reactions would tend to promote solvolysis. The GermanAuslegeschrift 1,253,264 describes the hydrochlorination of butadiene in a gas phase reaction. The present invention is an improvement over the prior art processes in that it may be carried out in liquid phases of the reactants, at low temperatures and with minimal solvolysis of products. Also, the process of the invention employs relatively inexpensive catalysts which are recoverable and reusable a plurality of times. The present invention is particularly advantageous when used to hydrochlorinate myrcene. Myrcene is a conjugated diene of the formula EMI2.1 Upon un catalyzed hydrochlorination of myrcene the major product is myrcenyl chloride. However, the commercially valuable products of myrcene hydrochlorination are the associated co products, namely, geranyl chloride and neryl chloride. Hydrochlorination in the presence of a copper catalyst shifts the reaction in favor of the desired co products.It has been postulated that the hydrochlorination of myrcene in the presence of a copper catalyst proceeds according to the reaction scheme EMI3.1 tb SEP partial tb SEP isomerization tb SEP I tb SEP A tb cl tb SEP Cl SEP SEP I tb SEP tb SEP I SEP j SEP Cl tb myrcene SEP geranyl SEP neryl SEP linalyl tb SEP I SEP chloride SEP chloride SEP chloride tb SEP 11 SEP III SEP IV tb SEP tf cl SEP X tb SEP Cm SEP cm tb SEP dichlorides SEP alpha terpinyl tb SEP chloride tb SEP V SEP VI tb Cyclization may also undesirably occur to form the alpha terpinyl chlorides. When the copper catalyst employed is in the form of cupric chloride CuC12 the products generally include substantial proportions of linalyl chloride and lesser proportions of the desired geranyl and neryl chlorides.When the copper catalyst is in the form of cuprous chloride, the linalyl chloride product is lessened due, apparently, to partial isomerization to the desired geranyl and neryl chlorides. From the above proposed reaction scheme, it will be appreciated that any process for hydrochlorination of myrcene, to be commercially feasible, must result in a favorable yield of the desired geranyl II and neryl III monochlorides and minimal formation on linalyl IV and alpha terpinyl VI monochlorides. It was previously appreciated that the relative proportions of monochlorides II , III and IV in the hydrochlorination product reaction mixture could be controlled to some degree by selection of the reaction temperature, gas flowrate and catalyst concentration. We have now found that when the prior art hydxhalogenation of a conjugated diene, such as the hydrochlorination of isoprene and in particular the hydrochlorination of myrcene, is carried out in the presence of an alcohol, then the isomerization of the allylic chloride products during the hydrohalogenation reaction is shifted to favor formation of the less substituted allylic chloride, being geranyl chloride II and neryl chloride III in the above example.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention comprises, in a method for the hydrohalogenation of a conjugated diene which comprises, hydrohalogenating the diene under anhydrous, liquid phase conditions in the presence of a catalytic proportion of a hydrohalogenation catalyst, the improvement which comprises adding to the hydrohalogenation reaction mixture a catalytic proportion of an alcohol. The improved process of the invention may be carried out in a batch or a continous manner.It is preferred to use as a diene myrcene or isoprene and then the halogen should be chlorine and the catalyst is a copper catalyst.An improved process is carried out at a temperature from about 300C to 500C.The preferred catalyst is cuprous catalyst and the preferred proportion of copper catalyst is within the weight range of 0.01 to 10.0 percent of dry diene. The process is especially carried out for a period of from 3 to 15 hours.It is furthermore preferred to use a molar ratio of alcohol to copper catalyst within the weight range of from 0.1 to 5.0.The preferred alcohol is selected from the group of the formula R OH wherein R is selected from the group consisting of alkyl having 1 to 25 carbon atoms, inclusive and aralkyl having 7 to 25 carbon atoms, inclusive, and is especially selected from the group consisting of isobutanol, isopropanol, hexanol, cyclohexanol, 3 pentanol, octanol, decanol and geraniol.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING The drawing is a schematic representation of a preferred embodiment method of the invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERREDEMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION The process of the invention may be employed for the hydrohalogenation of any conjugated diene. Representative of such dienes are myrcene, isoprene, 2 methylpiperylene, beta phellandrene, 2 ethylbutadiene, ocimene, alloocimene, 1 phenylbutadiene, and the like. The method of the invention is particularly advantageous for the hydrohalogenation of myrcene to obtain the geranyl and neryl halides which are intermediates for the manufacture of commercially valuable geraniol and nerol.When applied to myrcene, the improved method of the invention will increase the overall yield of the geranyl and neryl halides over the prior art processes and will improve selectivity of the ratio of geranyl isomer to the neryl isomer. Commercially available myrcene made by pyrolysis of beta pinene, purified forms of myrcene, and myrcene isolated from natural materials may be provided as the starting material in the preferred process of the invention. The accompanying drawing is a schematic representation of a preferred embodiment method of the invention for the hydrochlorination of myrcene. As shown in the Figure the provided myrcene initially held in tank 10 may be first dried in a conventional salt bed dryer 20 to remove water, as necessary. The dried myrcene is then preferably cooled to a temperature in the range of from about 30 C to about 30 C. most preferably circa 100C. in a cooling unit 30.Alternatively, the myrcene may be cooled first and then processed through a salt bed dryer 20 to remove water.Cooling the starting myrcene prior to drying in the salt bed dryer 20 is somewhat advantageous in that pre cooling increases drying efficiency in the salt bed dryer 20. As shown in the Figure the dried and cooled myrcene starting material may be passed into a hydrohalogenation apparatus which comprises in the preferred embodiment a stirred tank reactor 40. In the reactor 40, hydrohalogenation of the introduced myrcene is carried out in the presence of a catalytic proportion of a hydrohalogenation catalyst, at a temperature within the range of from about 300C. to about 500C. preferably at a temperature within the range of from 100C. to 250C., most preferably about IOOC, Hydrohalogenation may be effected, for example, by reaction of the myrcene with a hydrogen halide like hydrogen chloride or hydrogen bromide, in substantially anhydrous form and under substantially anhydrous conditions, i.e.having less than about 5 water present in the reaction mixture. As shown in the figure, the preferred hydrohalogenation is with gaseous hydrogen chloride which is introduced as a gas possibly generated in a vaporizer, and then metered into the reactor 40, via appropriate conduits.Advantageously, the hydrogen chloride is metered into the reactor 40 at a rate of from about 2.0 to about 300 gms hour mole of myrcene present in the reactor 40.Preferably, the rate is from about 4.0 to 8.0 gms hour mole of myrcene. The alcohol is introduced into the reactor 40 from storage vessel 50. Myrcene, alcohol, hydrogen chloride and copper catalyst are introduced into the reactor 40 sequentially. Preferably, the reactor 40 after purging with an inert gas such as nitrogen is first charged with the cool myrcene, the copper catalyst, and the alcohol. While cooling and stirring, the hydrogen chloride is added incrementally to the charge. A wide variety of catalysts for hydrohalogenation of myrcene are well known and include, for example, any copper compound compound having a valency of 2 or less, including metallic copper. Any copper compound convertible to the halide such as the bromide, iodide or chloride under conditions of the reaction may also be used. Representative of copper catalysts advantageously employed are the chloride, bromide, carbonate, oxide, acetate, formate, sulfate, and like derivative cupric and cuprous compounds. Preferred as the hydrochlorination catalyst in the improved process of the invention is cuprous chloride.Catalytic proportions of the anhydrous hydrohalogenation catalyst are generally within the weight range of from about 0.01 to 10 percent of the dry diene, preferably about 0.5 percent, especially myrcene. A wide range of alcohols may be employed in the improved process of the invention. Advantageously the alcohol selected is one which is a fluid under the processI conditions and inert to reaction with the reaction mixture ingredients. Representative of such alcohols are hexanol, decanol, geraniol, isopropanol, isobutanol, 3 pentanol, decanol, cyclohexanol, and the like. Preferred alcohols are those of the formula R OH VII wherein R represents alkyl or aralkyl. The term alkyl as used herein means the mqnovalent moiety obtained upon removal of a hydrogen atom from a parent alkane. Representative of alkyl are alkyl to 1 to 25 carbon atoms, inclusive, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, undecyl, decyl, dodecyl, octadecyl, nonodecyl, eicosyl, heneicosyl, docosyl, tricosyl, tetracosyl, pentacosyl and the isomeric forms thereof. The term aralkyl as used herein means alkyl as defined above wherein a hydrogen atom has been replaced with a monovalent moiety obtained upon removal of a hydrogen atom from an aromatic hydrocarbon. Representative of aralkyl are aralkyl of 7 to 25 carbon atoms, inclusive, such as benzyl, phenethyl, phenpropyl, phenbutyl, phenhexyl, napthoctyl and the like. Preferably, the R moiety will contain from 2 to 22 carbon atoms, inclusive most preferably 6 to 10 carbon atoms, inclusive, The most preferred alcohols will not contain nitrogen containing groups which might degrade under reaction conditions. It will be appreciated that under specific conditions of operating the process of the invention, certain of the above described alcohols of the formula VII given above have advantages over other compounds of the same general formula. Selection of a particular alcohol VII for use under specific process conditions, for optimum yields may be made by trial and error technique. The alcohol is used in a proportion to isomerize, during the hydrohalogenation reaction, at least some of the more substituted allylic chloride produced in the method of the invention. Such a proportion is generally within the range of from about 0.01 to 10 percent by weight of the diene charge, preferably 0.1 to 5 percent. This proportion of alcohol catalyst is added to the hydrohalogenation reaction mixture, without consideration of any alcohol by product which may have been undesirably formed in the reaction mixture by solvolysis of desired product. Optimum proportions will depend to some extent upon the alcohol selected and may be determined by trial and error technique. The controlling reaction rate in the hydrohalogenation process of the invention is the isomerization of the more substituted halide to the desired less substituted halide. This is controlled by residence time in the hydrohalogenation reaction zone. We have found that in hydrochlorination of myrcene, the preferred minimum total residence time is within the range of from 3 to 15 hours, and most preferably 5 to 8 hours under the above described operating temperatures. The presence of linalyl chloride in the reaction mixture may be monitored by conventional analytical techniques. Longer residence times in the hydrochlorination reactor may cause a yield loss due to conversion of the monochlorides to alpha terpinyl chloride.Shorter residence times may not be sufficient to isomerize the linalyl chloride to the desired geranyl neryl chlorides. When it has been determined that hydrohalogenation has occurred to a maximum desired point, the hydrohalogenation product mixture is passed from the hydrohalogenation apparatus. The desired hydrohalogenated diene may be separated from the reaction mixture employing conventional and known techniques including washing, decantation, distillation and like techniques. The alcohol may be recovered by distillation and reused a plurality of times. The following examples describe the manner and process of making and using the invention and set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventors of carrying out the invention but are not to be construed as limiting.
