# A method of liquid filtration.

## Abstract
A method of liquid filtration comprises providing an electrically conducting high surface area bed which has been electrically charged and passing the liquid to be filtered therethrough to cause electrosorption or adsorption of contaminants therein by the bed. The bed can be charged by application of a potential thereto or passage of a current therethrough. Regeneration of the bed can be achieved by changing the electrical potential of the bed and passing a cleansing liquid therethrough. This causes the contaminants retained within the bed to be desorbed, discharged into the cleansing liquid and thereby removed from the bed.
