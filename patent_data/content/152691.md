# Highly flame resistant rigid urethane isocyanurate foam compositions.

## Abstract
Highly flame resistant rigid urethane isocyanurate foams, are prepared from compositions containing blowing agent, a polyester polyol derived from the residue of di methyl terephthalate or terephthalic acid production, a phosphorus containing polyol and an isocyanurate catalyst, in which the NCO OH ratio is 3 to 6.
