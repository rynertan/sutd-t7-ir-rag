## Description
DRAINING DEVICE Essentially two different types of draining devices and in particular draining pipes can be said to exist if these are grouped according to their function. In a first type the water is filtered into the pipe through small holes and openings allowing the water to enter the pipe but not the particles of the surrounding soil. In time, however, these openings will become clogged by particles of the right size for getting stuck in the holes. Gradually these pipes become inefficient. The second type of draining makes use of a riser space in which the water to be drained off is allowed to rise, then to overflow an edge or treshold into the transporting channel or pipe. The drain pipe of this type is e.g.described in the European patent 79901621.7. The pipe described in this publication is today the only pipe existing on the market using this principle. The reason is that drain pipes using this principle has a tendency to become rather expensive and even if the function is by far better than that of other pipes the initial cost is mostly the deciding factor and not the number of years with untroubled function. In the mentioned riser space a gravity separation takes place since the water speed upwards is rather slow and thus very little solid matter enters the pipe, and since there are no small openings of filter character it is almost impossible to get the pipe clogged. Unfortunately, however, the price is not sufficiently economically compatible with inferior pipes.In view of the above drawbacks with the known technique, there exists today on the market a need of a less expensive draining using the better of the above draining techniques. It is the object of the invention to overcome these drawbacks and give an inexpensive and extremely efficient draining device.In accordance with the invention this object is achieved with a draining device including vessel like means with the opening turned downwards. This vessel like means is provided with lateral openings through which a pipe can be arranged, a pipe on its upper side provided with openings or slots serving as an entrance into the pipe for water that rises in the space between the pipe and the vessel like means.The invention can be realized in different ways. To start with, the drain need is not always continuous instead one some time needs draining at on point or several points. In this case it is sufficient if the vessel like means enclosing the pipe have standardized lateral openings coinciding with the diameter of standardized pipes.In this way the vessel like menas can be pushed on to pipes used for leading away water, placing the vessellike means on the localities where it is considered most necessary. The vessel like means does not necessarily have to enclose the pipe completely but it is also possible to allow the vessel like means to snap over the pipe, which gives the advantage that if it is discovered that further draining along a pipe leading away drain water is needed, it is only necessary to open up a shaft down to the pipe adapting the vessel like means over the pipe after providing it with holes in the upper side, and then refilling with gravel of correct size. It is of advantage to make the vessel like means somewhat wider than the opening, so that these easily can be packed in each other resulting in a compact and inexpensive transporting and storing of these.Since the vessel like means in accordance with the invention is very simple to manufacture it can easily be stored in a number of dimensions suitable for the most used pipe dimensions. Furthermore, the lateral openings can be surrounded by rings that can be broken away in order to adapt the vessel like means to different pipe dimensions. The vessel like means can futther be provided with additional flanges on the inside, which may strengthen the vessel like means and also divides the interior of vessels, so that separate rising spaces are obtained along the pipe. This is of particular advantage as it eliminates transportation along the pipe in the rising spaces. A transportation lengthwise in the rising space might stir the gravitationally separated particles.Instead of realising the invention with distinct vessellike means placed along the pipe and with a short extension in comparison with the pipe the invention can also be embodied with the vessel like means extending over the entire pipe length. This vessel like means extending over the length of the pipe can be considered as a continuous series of short vessel like means adjacent to each other, or it can be considered as one long vessel like means divided into short separate compartments in order to eliminate the risk of water transport lengthwise of the pipe in the rising spaces.In one particular embodiment of this type the vessel like means is an outer longitudinally slotted or cut pipe and mounted over the first inner pipe, the space between the pipes being defined by distance elementsaarranged on the inner or outer pipe in order to obtain a rising space for water that is then to flow in through the holes in the top of the inner pipe.In a further development of this continuous variety of the invention the inner pipe as well as the outer one is corrugated. In this way a flexible drain pipe is obtained, which increases the using possibilities, e.g. within the agricultural field, since it can be ploughed down with machines. By dimensioning the height of the corrugations or the height of the flanges related to the holes in the inner pipe, it is possible to control the flow speed of the water from the rising spaces and into the inner pipe.In this way different pipes can be adapted to different types of soil, this since the water flow speed in the riser spaces determines if particles are to be drawn up with the water into the inner pipe or if the intended separation takes place.The above pipe can be suitably fabricated by simultanous manufacture of two corrugated pipes in a way known per se, which pipes are manufactured parallelly regarding extrusion and shaping. Thereafter one pipe is cut up or slotted and the other is provided with holes, after which the slotted pipe is snapped over the inner pipe, preferably while those pipes are so hot that a welding or glueing together of these take place. It can be suitable to place the corrugation essentially symmetric to enhance flexibility. It should be observed in this connection that the corrugations need not have a symmetric wave form, but within the. scope of the invention the shape can be so asymmetric that the corrugations are flanges.Since entering of the water into the inner water transporting pipe takes place on the upper side the transport in the pipe is at all times unhindered. Should the pipe be fed with so much water, due to its length, unsufficient width, water from other sources, that it is fully filled with water, the drain pipe or drain device will of course instead make water enter the soil from the pipe. This is however not a disadvantage, but actually an advantage since, e.g. short heavy rains force water out into the ground improving the ground water level. If the ground water level is sufficient the water is later led away by the drain pipe as soon as the rain has passed. In other words, the space around the pipe is used as a temporary water supply, which to a great extent improves the capacity of the pipe and the drains system. Further advantages and features of the invention will become aparent from the following description related to the drawings. In the drawing fig 1 shows a first embodiment of the invention seen from above, fig 2 a second embodiment of the invention seen from the side, fig 3 the embodiment according to fig 2 in a vertical longitudinal section, fig 4 a horizontal longitudinal section of the embodiment shown in fig 2, fig 5 the embodiment in fig 2 seen from above and figs 6 and 7 cross sections of the same pipe.As can be seen from fig 1 the first embodiment comprises a shallow vessel or doomlike part 1 with two inclined sides 2 and 3 provided with more or less oval openings for the insertion of a pipe 4. The pipe 4 is on it upper side provided with a number of openings 5. These openings 5 are turned up towards the top wall 6 of the vessel like means 1. The vessel like means is further provided with a support bearing against the soil below in the form of a base flange 7. Preferably the lateral openings in the sides 2 and 3 are provided with a seal 8.As can be seen form fig 1 the vessel shaped means around the openings for the pipe is provided with a scale enabling the user to obtain the desired drain level independently of the slope of the pipe, by turning the pipe. Of course only each part pipe can be turned its own angle, but since in general several parts are necessary these can each be turned independently and give a relatively constant drain level .Even if this embodiment is intended for use with any pipe in which one or more openings or slots in one way or the other are arranged in the upper side of the pipe, it is of course possible to manufacture special pipes already prepared for holes.It should further be mentioned that this embodiment of the invention provides a great drain surface per meter pipe, which in turn means a great draining capacity.The drain surface is the base surface of the upside down turned vessel shaped means. Since the entrance surface is turned downwards the risk of clogging is greatly diminished.This risk is further diminished by the great available entrance cross section into the pipe. Since the water is first forced to rise vertically and then to enter from above into the pipe no intermediate elements are necessary between the draining and the pipe leading the water away and the pipe can thus be permitted to transport not only the water drained into it, but also the water from e.g.roofs of houses etc. This in turn means that it is possible to obtain a great flow velocity in the pipe resulting in a good cleaning of this if for instance organic matter should enter from the soil.A second embodiment of the invention shown in the drawings encloses an inner pipe which has been given the reference 11 and an outer pipe 12. The outer pipe, as initially manufactured, essentially had the same diameter as the inner pipe and has been longitudinally cut and mounted over the inner pipe. The corrugation 13 of the inner pipe extends outwards from this and is in contact with the corrugations 14 extending inwards from the outer pipe. These projections or corrugations have been allowed to fuse or weld together since the pipes are still relatively hot when the outer pipe is placed over or around the inner one. In this way the rising space 15 for water is obtained between the corrugations. Water from the bottom edge 16 of the slotted pipe can thus rise upwards in the rising spaces 15 then to flow over into the inner pipe 11 through holes 17.In order further to adapt the invention to different types of soil, which in turn means different particle sizes and depcndent thereon a differing tendency for being swept along upwards in the rising spaces it can be suitable to build in corresponding automatic control means in the pipe, so that not so many different varieties of the pipe need to be fabricated i.e. with different entrance cross sections . This can e.g. be achieved by providing all or some of the holes with resilient tongues or the like. Depending on the pressure and the flow the tongue opens to different degrees and with a greater flow and pressure it is bent away freeing an enlarged cross section for the water flow. Since the water fed to the drain pipe is proportional to the size of particles in the soil that in turn is reversed proportional to the risk of the particles being drawn away, the desired balance can be obtained
