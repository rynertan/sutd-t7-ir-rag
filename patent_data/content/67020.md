# Hydrostripping process of crude oil.

## Abstract
Hydrostripping process which is the combination of crude oil distillation and hydrotreating of distillate overhead wherein crude oil is distilled with hydrogen rich gas at high temperature and under high pressure. Hydrogen partial pressure at the distilled vapor phase in a stripper 4 which is enough for a desulfurization reaction is maintained sufficiently to allow a smooth distillation proces sing whereby an efficient crude oil stripping performed. The dis tillate overhead thus produced is maintained at a temperature high enough for direct feeding to a subsequent hydrotreating process by means of a reflux cooler 6 installed at the top of the stripper 4 , thereby eliminating any intermediate process such as an adjusting process.
