# Article comprising a negative X ray resist containing poly 2,3 dichloro 1 propyl acrylate and poly glycidyl methacrylate co ethyl acrylate and method using this resist.

## Abstract
This invention relates to negative x ray resists useful in the production of high resolution patterned images. The x ray resist contains a mixture of poly 2,3 dichloro 1 propyl acry late and poly glycidyl methacrylate co ethyl acrylate , with the latter forming between 1 percent and 20 percent by weight, of the total polymer mixture. This ray resist has adhesive and re solving properties superior to those of poly 2,3 dichloro 1 propyl acrylate . Superior properties of the mixture are attri buted to the fact that the two polymers form a compatible po lymer mixture which is a relatively rare and unpredictable event in polymer chemistry.
