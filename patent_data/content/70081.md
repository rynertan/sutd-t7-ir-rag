# Luggage binder for a bicycle or like vehicle.

## Abstract
A luggage binder for a bicycle, comprising at least one elastic band 1 having two enlarged ends, one of which being secured in a handgrip 10 and the other in a slot 4 of an adjusting clasp 5. The band 1, starting from the adjusting clasp 5, forms a loop and extends through a second slot 9 in the adjusting clasp 5 to the handgrip 10. The adjusting clasp 5 is tiltable about its longitudinal axis. In the normal or operating position, the adjusting clasp 5 is not slidable since the band 1 presses on the enlarged band end 2 in the clasp 5. By tilting the clasp 5, this pressure is removed and the clasp 5 is conveniently slidable for adjustment of the band length to the dimensions of the luggage.
