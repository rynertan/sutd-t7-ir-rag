# Improved toothbrush.

## Abstract
The toothbrush has brush heads integrally disposed perpendicularly on opposite ends of a common handle. One brush head 12,18 has a concave shaped bristle surface connected to a bent end 16 of the handle and the other 13,19 with a convex shaped bristle surface is connected to the other end 17 to form a T shape. Both brush heads slide tightly along a pair of tongues of the brush head holders integrally and perpendicularly attached to each end of the common handle. Thus the toothbrush heads stay in position while being used. Both heads have a pair of channels at their sides and a groove at their centre along their length with a slot at the centre to make them slidable, to their corresp. holders.

## Description
IMPROVED TOOTHBRUSHBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to an improved toothbrush for which Patent No. 17574 was issued to me by the Philippine Patent Office October 1, 1984.This toothbrush deals with the positioning of two toothbrush heads, the longer one with a concave shaped bristle surface made longer than the other, which has a convex shaped bristle surface. One embodiment of this invention permits the two brush heads to be integrally and perpendicularly connected at their mid section to each end of their common handle made either firm or foldable. The other embodiment permits the longer brush head to be slidably attached to the brush head holder integrally and perpendicularly attached to the end of its handle. While, in the said patent, the shorter brush head is attached to the bent end of said handle, this time, it is attached to the straight end of the same common handle, to permit a more convenient and more efficient brushing of the lingual surface of and the chewing surfaces of the teeth. While, in the said patent, only the longer brush head was slidably attached to the brush head holder fixed perpendicularly to its handle, this time, the shorter brush head was also made slidably attached to the brush head holder, likewise, fixed at the straight end of the same handle to readily permit the cleansing of the lingual and chewing surfaces of the teeth. While, in the said patent, the slidable brush head and the brush head holder are not provided with an interlocking device, this time, these two slidable brush heads and their respective brush head holders are correspondingly and integrally provided with such device to prevent these brush heads from being thrown off while being used in brushing the teeth.PRIOR ART The toothbrushes being used today have their single toothbrush head permanently disposed in line with their handle, so that, their users have the tendency to brush the labial surfaces of their teeth, specially the left and right posterior teeth horizontally or, often times, not in the manner specifically prescribed by dentists.Because of their design or configuration, the cleansing of the lingual surfaces of the teeth is done minimally, if not out right neglected, specially so, when users are in a hurry. This manner of cleansing their teeth, which has been formed as a habit, is very common to working parents as well as, to school children or students.OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION The general object of this invention, therefore, is to provide its prospective end users a new kind of toothbrush that will always make them conveniently and effectively brush up or down, the labial surfaces of the teeth, particularly, the left and right posterior teeth and effectively sweep off tiny food particles that cling to the lingual surfaces of the teeth and those left in between them, as well as those that cling to their chewing surfaces. A nother object of this invention is to provide its end users with a less expensive and yet more convenient and effective toothbrush thru the use or the slidable and economically replaceable toothbrush heads. Another object of this invention is to provide cigarette smokers with a toothbrush that could conveniently and effectively sweep off the accumulation of blackish nicotine from the lingual surface of their teeth and forthwith prevent its further accumulation thereon thru the use of the shorter brush head. Still another object of this invention is to provide those wearing full dentured false teeth a more functional and, therefore more practical toothbrush they need while holding and cleansing their false teeth. Other objects, aims, features and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying figures of the drawing, in which FIGURE 1 is perspective view of the toothbrush showing the two toothbrush heads integrally and perpendicularly disposed at the opposite ends of their common handle FIGURE 2 is a cross sectional view of a toothbrush head taken along line 2 2 of FIGURE 1 FIGURE 3 is the perspective view of another embodiment of the toothbrush with slidably detachable brush heads FIGURE 4 is a perspective view of the toothbrush handle with its slidably connected toothbrush heads FIGURE 5 is an enlarged perspective bottom view of one of the toothbrush heads showing a pair of channels FIGURE 6 is a cross sectional view of the toothbrush head taken along line 6 6 of FIGURE 5 FIGURE 7 is a cross sectional view of a toothbrush head taken along line 7 7 of FIGURE 5 showing also a part of the brush head holder and FIGURE 8 is a perspective view of another embodiment showing a foldable toothbrush handle.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Referring now to the different views of the drawing wherein like reference numeral designates the same part throughout, there is shown a toothbrush 10 having a handle 11 and brush heads 12 and 13 perpendicularly and integrally connected on opposite ends 14 and 15, respectively. Handle 11 is provided with a bend 16 to which the longer brush head 12 is perpendicularly connected while the other end 1 5 is made somewhat straight to which the other toothbrush head 13, which is shorter, is integrally and perpendicularly connected to formT shaped configuration 17.Made long enough to permit either half of it to reach and effectively brush up or down either the left or the right posterior teeth up to their farthest ends, this longer brush head 12 or 18 in another embodiment is provided with concave shaped bristle surface 32 purposely adapted to have the same or more or less the same cqnfiguration of labial outer surface of the teeth. On the other hand the shorter brush head 13 or 19 made short enough to permit effective and convenient cleansing of the lingual surfaces of the teeth by sweep method, is provided with convex shaped bristle surface 33 purposedly adapted to conform with the curvature of the lingual inner surfaces of the teeth and thereby making it conveniently and effectively sweep off the tiny food particles from said lingual surfaces of and in between the teeth, as well as those from their chewing surfaces. In the other embodiment shown in FIGURES 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 these two toothbrush heads 18 and 19 could be detachably or slidably connected to toothbrush head holders 20 and 21 respectively. Each toothbrush head 18 and 19 is provided with a pair of channels 22 and 23, respectively, with a groove 24 disposed along the length at the center and a slot 25 at the mid section thereof.In the other hand, each toothbrush head holder 20 and 21 which is integrally connected to the the handle 26 is provided with a pair of tongues 27 and 28, respectively, with studs 29 and 30, protruding at its centermost section designed to ride along the groove 24 on top of the brush head 18 when said brush holder 20 is inserted into and pushed forward into said brush head 1 8 thru its pair of channels 22 so that the stud 29 may go over a hump 31 and forthwith drop into the slot 25 to firmly position itself therein. Thus, making toothbrush head and toothbrush holders adequately locked together totally preventing the toothbrush heads from moving or slipping off from its hold on the toothbrush head holder while the toothbrush is being used. However a tight enough slidability of the toothbrush heads along the pair of tongue of the toothbrush head holder could make the hold on this toothbrush head quite steady or tight enough to warrant the elimination of the interlocking device described above. Figure 3 is the perspective view of the entire toothbrush assembly as described in Figure 4 ready for use in the brushing the teeth. As shown specially in Figure 8 the toothbrush 34 having separate handles 35 and 36 with their ends 37 and 38 connected pivotally is purposely adapted to make the toothbrush less bulky when stored or not being used.
