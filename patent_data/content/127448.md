# Focussing error detecting apparatus.

## Abstract
A focussing error detecting apparatus includes a compo site lens 30 formed of a single lens 30α made of glass and a single lens 39β made of plastics material, and a photo detector 8 . The glass lens 30α has a uniform focal length, the plastics lens 30β is formed of a pair of lens regions 30 a, 30 b divided by a flat interface T including an optical axis O of light incident on the composite lens 30 , and the lens regions 30 a, 30 b have different back focal lengths f ₁, f ₂ and spaced optical axes O₁, O₂ . The photo detector 8 has its photo detecting face positioned at a middle point between converged points of light rays from the pair of lens regions 30 a, 30 b on the optical axis 0 of the incident light when the light incident on the composite lens 30 is focussed. The photo detector 8 has first and second sensors 8A, 8B for a receiving light from the far and near side portion of the first lens region 30 a relative to the interface T , and third and fourth sensors 8C, 8D for receiving light from the far and near side portions of the second lens region 30 b relative to the interface T .
