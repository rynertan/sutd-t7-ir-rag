# DC tachometer.

## Abstract
A brushless DC tachometer including an alternator which produces a substantially trapezoidal output signal coupled to a field effect transistor switching bridge is claimed. The trape zoidal output signal is achieved using a block permanent mag net for one pole and a consequent pole contoured to achieve a substantially uniform flux density for the winding over a dis tance sufficient to produce said trapezoidal output signal.
