# A BATTERY CHARGING SYSTEM

## Abstract
Battery charging system comprises a charging unit 2 having a controllable power output, a control means 3 ad apted to control the power output of the charging unit, and at least two batteries 4, 5 which receive the power output of the charging unit. The power output from the charging unit 2 is controlled 8 via the control means 3 for maximum, or at least near maximum power during the whole of the charging time. When an excessively high charge is established 15, 16 in the batteries 4, 5 the charging unit 2 is controlled 18, 22, 29 through the control means 3 in a manner to switch the charging unit to a batterycharge maintaining mode or to a level of charge adapted for final charging of the battery.
