# SEPARATION OF TH 4 FROM COMPOSITIONS LOADED WITH TH 4 AND UO2 2

## Abstract
A composition is contacted with an aqueous solution having a pH greater than 2 containing a suitable Th‚Å¥ chelating agent and a carboxylic acid. The composition comprises either A one or more organic chelating compounds compris ing microbial siderophores, covalently fixed to the surface of a suitable insoluble carrier and possessing one or more co ordinating sites, or B one or more catechol compounds covalently fixed to the surface of a suitable insoluble carrier at the benzene ring thereof, the catechol compounds comprising unsubstituted catechol or catechol substituted on the benzene ring by one or two electrophilic substituents.
