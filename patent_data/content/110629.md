# Transesterification of esters.

## Abstract
A process for the transesterfication of a carboxylic or carbonic acid ester comprises reacting the carboxylic or carbonic acid ester under transesterification conditions with an alcohol in the presence, as catalyst, of either i a Group V element containing Lewis base and an epoxide or ii a cyclic amidine. The Lewis base can be an organic compound containing trivalent phosphorus or nitrogen and can be an amine, for example an amidine. The process can be operated in the liquid phase at a temperature of from 15 to 150 C, and the catalyst is employed in solution. Preferred catalysts ar those where the cyclic amidine forms part of a fused ring system containing six and five membered rings, six and seven membered rings or two six membered rings.
