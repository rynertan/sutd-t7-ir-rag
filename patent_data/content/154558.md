# DEMOUNTABLE CONTAINER

## Abstract
A demountable container having a plurality of side walls 1 which are releasably connected in edge to redge relation ship and in a manner such that adjacent said walls 1 extend angularly relative to one another. Means for interconnecting the walls 1 includes an alternating series of lugs 7 and apertures 8 provided along each of two side edges 6 of each wall 1 . The lugs 7 of each of two interconnected side edges 6 engage with respective apertures 8 of the other side edge 6 and the lugs 7 and apertures 8 are so arranged that engagement is effected in a sequential order commencing at one end of the series and finishing at the other. The walls 1 are formed of plastic or other material such as to be capable of limited resilient distortion along their edges for the purpose of effecting the aforementioned engagement. Also, the arrangement of the lugs 7 and apertures 8 is such that each of two adjacent pair of engaging lugs 7 and apertures 8 resist separation of the respective walls 1 in different directions.
