# OPTICALLY ACTIVE 1 AROMATIC GROUP SUBSTITUTED 1 ALKANONES AND METHODS FOR THEIR MANUFACTURE

## Abstract
A manufacturing method is described for the prepara tion of optically active 1 aromatic group substituted 1 alkanones of the formula ArH R wherein Ar is an atomic group, X is hydrogen or sulfonyloxy and R is a saturated aliphatic group. An optically active alkane acid halide of the formula RHY wherein Y is halogen, is allowed to react with an aromatic compound in the presence of a Lewis acid. The optically active 1 aromatic group substituted 1 alkanones are useful intermediates in the preparation of optically active alpha arylalkanoic acids, which are useful as pharmaceutical, e.g. anti inflammatory, analgesic and anti pyretic, agents and as insecticidal agents.
