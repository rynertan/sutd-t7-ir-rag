## Description
TITLE Catalytic alkylation process This invention relates to an improved process for the cetalytic alkylation of isobutane with an olefin Phe catalytic alkylation of isobutane is well known in the art and involves the reaction of an olefin with iosbusane in the presence of an acid catalyst to produce high octane branched chain hydrocarbons alkylate for use i . aviation gasoline and motor fuel. Specifically, the olefin is combined with isobutane in the presence of an acid catalyst in a reactor and undergoes an exoti ermic reaction. The acid is then separated from the factor effluent.After acid separation, the reactor effluent proceeds to a series of distillation colums to separate the inert alkanes, the unreacted isob ane for recycling, and to recover the alkylate.Some of the effluent is treated to remove residual acid and Indesired reaction products. A variation of this process has been to use the vapouiization of a portion of the reactor effluent to cool the reactor, and has been described in Hydrocarbon Processing, September, 1974, page 266. Ihe vapours produced by cooling the reactor Ilave been toed to supply heat to a deisobutanizer diatilletion column. U.S. Patent No.3,162,694 and U.S. ReissuePatent No. 26,060 disclose such a process. These processes however, suffer from several disadvantages. First, the amount of vapours produced by cooling the reactor are not normally sufficient to supply the total heat necessary to the deisobutanizer. Secondly, the normally high operating pressures of the distillation columns make it difficult to use these vapours as a source of heat. The present invention reduces the disadvantages of the known processes by using the reactor effluent to cool the overhead vapour streams of the distillation columns used in the process. This allows the distillation columns to operate at a much lower pressure.The increased vapours of the reactor effluent produced by cooling the distillation column overheads, along with the lower operating pressure of these columns, allows the total energy input to the process to be greatly reduced. The invention therefore provides a process for the catalytic alkylation of isobutane with an olefin in which a the olefin is contacted with a molar excess of isobutane and inert alkanes in the presence of an acid catalyst in a reactor to form a reactor effluent containing alkylate, isobutane, acid catalyst and inert alkanes b the acid catalyst is separated from the reactor. effluent to form a hydrocarbon mixture c a liquid vapour separation is effected on the hydrocarbon mixture to obtain a liquid bottoms stream containing isobutane and alkylate and an overhead vapour stream containing isobutane and inert alkanes, and d the liquid bottoms stream is heated in a distil lation zone to form a liquid bottoms product containing alkylate and a vapourous distillation effluent containing isobutane separated from the alkylate characterised in that a portion of the hydrocarbon mixture formed in step b is passed as a cooling effluent in indirect heat exchange with the vapourous distillation effluent obtained in step d to condense isobutane and to vapouriseat least a portion of the cooling effluent and the cooling effluent is admixed with the hydrocarbon mixture formed in step b so hat the cooling effluent is subjected to liquid vapour 7 ration together with the hydrocarbnn mixture in ste, . , and in that the overhead vapour stream produced in step c is compressed in a compressor to obtain a compressed vapour stream and at least a portion of the compressed vapour stream is passed in indirect heat exchange relation with the liquid in the distillation zone of d to condense at least a portion of the compressed vapour stream and thereby supply heat to the distillation zone. The invention further provides a process for separating inert alkanes and isobutane from a gaseous alkyla tion reactor effluent containing alkylate, isobutane and inert alkanes in which a the liquid vapour separation is effected on a por tion of the reactor effluent to obtain a overhead vapour stream containing isobutane and inert alkanes and a liquid bottoms stream containing isobutane and alkylate and b the overhead vapour stream is compressed which process is characterised in that, c at least a portion of the compressed overhead vapour stream is passed through a heat exchanger thereby at least partially condensing the compressed overhead vapour stream to form an exchanger effluent stream d a first portion of the exchanger effluent stream is passed to an alkane distillation zone in which the liquid is heated by passing it in indirect heat exchange with the heat exchanger of c , thereby distilling and separating inert alkane as a vapourousfraction and isobutane as a liquid bottoms product e a portion of the reactor effluent is passed as a cooling effluent in indirect heat exchange with the vapourousfraction of d to condense the inert alkane therein and to vapour a portion of the reactor effluent and f the cooling effluent is mixed with the reactor effluent so that the cooling effluent is subjected to liquid vapour separation together with the reactor effluent in step a . Using the process of the present invention, the amount of isobutane that must be treated and recovered in the distillation column is greatly reduced, cooling water is no longer necessary for the distillation column overhead condenser, the distillation columns may be operated at substantially lower pressures, and a much greater heat transfer rate may be acquired between the compressed vapour stream and the distillation columns. Further, the compressed vapour stream can now supply heat to columns other than the deisobutanizer. The invention will now be further described with reference to the accompanying drawings. Figure 1 shows the process as applied to a deisobutanizer distillation column. Figure 2 shows the process as applied to a depropanizer distillation column. Figure 3 shows an alternative embodiment of the process of Figure 2. Referring to Figure 1, olefin and isobutane feed, in liquid phase, are combined in line 101 and fed to reactor 103 where the reactants are mixed with acid catalyst and reacted to form alkylate. The product leaves the reactor through line 105 to the acid se rator 107. Here the acid is separated from the hydrocarbon mixture and returned to the reactor through line 108. The hydrocarbon mixture containing alkylate, isobutane and inert alkanes leaves the acid separator through line 109. The hydrocarbon mixture goes to provide cooling in te condensers through lines 111 and 112. Specifically referring to line 111, it is seen how the cooling function of the present invention is applied to the deisobutaniser column. Hydrocarbon mixture is transmitted through line lii and reduced in pressure by valve 141. The mixture is then transmitted to condenser 115 where at least part of the hydrocarbon mixture is vapourised to provide cooling in the condenser. The hydrocarbon mixture, after providing cooling, is transmitted through line 116 to the vapour liquid separator 117. Cooling may also be supplied to other condensers such as the depropaniser, shown in greater detail in Figure 2, or the later described butane sidestream draw from the deisobutaniser column, by taking the hydrocarbon mixture through line 112, vapouring at least part of the 13ydro carbon mixture in the condenser, and transmitting the condenser effluent through line 114 to the vapour liquid separator 117. The hydrocarbon mixture can also be used to cool the reactor through line 110, being let down on pressure through valve 140.It is then transmitted through line 113 to the vapour liquid separator. In the vapour liquid separator 117 a vapour liquid separation takes place. The vapour contains primarily isobutane and inert alkanes, and the liquid contains primarily isobutane and alkylates. However, some nbutane may be present in the liquid because of the boiling point of n butane. The vapours are transmitted through line 118 to a vapour compressor 119. The compressed vapours leave the compressor through line 120. The compressed vapours then go to provide heating in exchangers through lines 121 and 122. Specifically referring to line 122, it is seen how the heating function of the present invention is applied to the deisobutaniser column. The compressed vapours are transmitted through line 122 to a heat exchanger 123 wherein at least part of the vapours are condensed to provide heat in the exchanger.The conpressed vapours, after providing heat, are transmitted through line 124 to a condenser 128. This condenser effects a condensation of the remaining vapours, and the condensed, compressed vapours are then transmitted through line 130 to a second vapour liquid separator 132. In the same manner, heat is supplied to the other exchangers, such as the depropaniser heat exchanger, by taking the compressed vapours through line 121, condensing at least part of the vapours in the exchanger and transmitting the exchanger effluent through line 126. This stream is then combined with line 124 prior to condenser 128. The pressure in line 130 is maintained by valve 131. The condensed stream leaving condenser 128 through line 130 is reduced in pressure and thus partially vaporised by valve 131 prior to its entry in the second vapour liquid separator 132. Vapours are removed from the separator through line 133 and combined with line 118 back to the compressor. These vapours niay be returned to the suction of the compressor, or some intermediate point within the compressor stages. liquid from the second vapour liquid separator contains isobutane and some inert alkanes and is tzransmitted through line 134 back to the reactor to provide exce isobutane for the reaction. The liquid from the first vapour liquid separa1t 117 containing isobutane and alkylate proceeds through line 136 to a treating section where residual acid and acidic compounds are removed. After treating, the liquid is transmitted through line 138 to the deisobutaniser column 140. Heat is applied to tiie colims through heat exchanger 123 from the compressed vaporous as described previously. Isobutane is distilled and exits the top of the column as a vapour in line 142. This vapour is condensed in the overhead condenser 115 and the condensed isobutane is then split for reflux to the column through line 144, and is recycled to the reactor through line 146. The alkylate product is recovered as a liquid bottoms stream from the column through line 147. Also shown on the drawing is the optional use of recovering butane as a sidestream draw from the deisobutaniser column 140. Vapours are removed through line 148 and transmitted to condenser 150. The reactor effluent can be used as the cooling medium through line 112 and 114 to condense the butane. Butane is then recovered as a product from this condenser Referring to Figure 2, it is seen ho the eooli and heating functions of the present invention are applied to the processes that have depropaniser of tillation columns. The numbers of similar lines aiid equipment that appear in Figure 1 have becn kept the sane. Te reactor effluent, aftei being used as a coolant, enters the first vaours liquid separator 117 through line 113. A liquid bottoms stream containing isobutane and alkylate is removed through line 136 and sent to further processing as sown in Figure 1. The vapours from the vapour liquid separator are transmited through line 11 to compressor 119. The compressed vapours leave the compressor through line 120. The coripressed vapours then go to provide heating in exchangers through lines 121 and 122.Specifically referring, to line 121 it is seen how the present invention is applied to the depropaniser colunul. The compressed vapours are transmitted through line 121 to a heat exchanger 154 where at least part of the vapours are condensed to provide heat to the exchanger. The compressed vapours, after providing leat, are transmitted through line 126. This is combined with vapours that have exchanged heat in other exchangers returning in line 124, and transmitted to condenser 128. The condensed vapour stream leaves the condenser through line 130. A portion is taken through line 168 as feed to the depropaniser distillation column 152. Heat is applied to this column as described previously through heat exchanger 154. Propane is distilled and exits the top of the column as a vapour in line 156. This vapour is then condensed in condenser 158 by the use of the reactor effluent in lines 112 and 114. The condensed propane is then split into line 160 as reflux to the column, and line 162 as propane product.The isobutane rich bottoms leaves the depropaniser column through line 163, is let down in pressure through valve 164 and then transmitted to the second vapour liquid separator 132. The condensed vapours from condenser 128 that is not sent to the depropane column is also let down in pressure throughh valve 13 and transmitted to the second vapour liquid separate 132. The vapours are removed fror this separator through line 133 and recycled back to tite compressor as disclosed iI Figure 1. The liquid bo ttoms streas 134, containing mostly isobutane, can be recycled back to the reactor as also shown in Figure 1. Figure 3 represents an alternative and profet embodiment of the system shown in Figure 2. The primary difference between Figures 2 and that the compressed vaporous, after supplying head the depropaniser, are not totally condensed iu semde 128. The partially condensed vapour stream leaves the condenser 128 through line 130 and is sent to the vapour liquid separator 132. The condense vapours are then transmitted through line 200 as feed to the depropaniser. Thus te feed to the depropaniser, which is a liquid stream in the process of Figure is now a vapour stream. The isobutane rich bottom stream leaves the de propaniser column through line 202 and is recycled back to the reactor. This stream can be combined it the isobutane in line 134 from the vapour liquid separator. The present invention has many advantages over the rt. By combining the heating and cooling functions arge energy savings may be acquired. Cooling the overhead of trhe distillation columns by using the reactor effluent increases the amount C isobutane that is vapourised in the reactor effluent an need not be distilled. This reduces the size of the distillation columns aoci. the amount of heat neccesary to perform distillation. It also alloys the distillation columns to be operated at a much lower pressure than presently exists in the ar. By increasing the vapour flow and reducing the pressure in the distillatioh columns the compressed vapours can be used to supply the heat necessary for the distillation columns.Thus a significant saving is made in the cost of services because the water used to condense the overhead distillation column is no longer necessary, and the external heat supplied to the coluslls is greatly reduced or eliminated. In a preferred embodiment of the process according to this invention, the reactor effluent, after acid separation, is sent to the overhead condensers on the distillation columns of the process to provide cooling.The compressed vapours from the first vapour liquid separator are sent to the bottom heat exchangers to the distillation columns to provide heat. This concept is preferred because lower temperatures can be achieved in the columns using the reactor effluent than by using cooling water. With lower temperature and pressures in the columns the separation process is greatly enhanced and the amount of heat input to achieve this separation is reduced. Typically, at least two distillation columns are present, a deisobutaniser for separating isobutane from the alkylate product, and a depropaniser to recover the lighter propane from the deisobutane.In some cases a third column for separating butane from alkylate is present. The use of the present invention on this tower is also contemplated. Ho l ver, butane may also be removed as a sidestream draw flem the deisobutaniser column as shown in the drawings. After exchanging heat, the compressed vapou stream can be furthel condensed by a small cooler to remove the heat that cannot be economically recouvered through heat exchange. After the stream is condense, it can then be let do in pressure and sent te a vapour liquid separator.This separator removes as s vapour any uncondensed and lighter boiling components and recycles them back to the vapour compressor. Tulle isobutane rich liquid remaining in the separator can then be recycled back to the reactor The discharge pressure of the vapour compressor may be that generally used in knows processes ever, in the process according to the inventi oi a compressed vapour stream pressure of from 3.5 tc 14 megabarye gauge is preferred, more preferably about 10.5 megabarye gauge. This pressure will vary, according to the amount of heat transfer desired at a given distillation column.The higher the pressure of the distillation column the higher the discharge pressure of the vapour compressor. Thus it is advantageous to run the distillation columns at lower pressures than can now be achieved in the prior art The reactor illustrated in the Figures is a conventional liquid phase alkylation reactor. The reactor may however, also be a two phase cascade reactor in which the reaction zone is refrigerated directly by evaporation of low boiling hydrocarbons. In this type of reactor, the acid separation and vapourliquid separation take place within the reactor itself. The vapours are removed from the reactor, compressed and then used to supply heat to the distillation columns. The liquid from the reactor, removed as a separate stream, can be used to condense the overhead of the distillation columns. The deisobutaniser column may be operated at pressures between .07 and 10.5 megabarye gauge but it is preferred to operate at a pressure between 2.4 and 3.5 megabarye gauge. The depropaniser distillation column may be operated at a pressure between 3.5 and 10.5 megabarye gauge wit a preferred pressure between 5.3 and 8.8 megabarye gauge. This invention may be used in any catalytic alkylation process involving an acid catalyst. The acid catalysts that may be used are known in the art, In particular sulphuric acid and hydrofluoric acid.The use of a sulphuric acid catalyst is preferred in the process of the present invention. The reaction conditions and parameters are not significantly changed by this invention. The reactor is normally operated between 0.07 and 14 megabarye gauge, and a temperature between 10 to 500C. The olefin feed to the alkylation process is also known in the art and is not changed by the process of the present invention. The composition of the olefin feed normally depends on the specific application, but may comprise propylene, butylenes or amylenes. The olefin feed may also contain various inert alkanes, such as propane and butane. The olefin is mixed with isobutane either before going to the reactor or in the reactor. Normally, the higher the ratio of isobutane to olefin in the feed stock the greater the yield of alkylate. This external ratio is usually about 5 1 but can be 15 1 or higher. The present invention takes advantage of this ratio by recovering isobutane for recycling in a more efficient and less costly manner than the present art. By using this invention in existing units this ratio can be increased, thereby improving the octane of the product without being limited by the size of the deisobutaniser. Further, the use of a higher ratio also reduces acid consumption during the reaction. As shown in the drawings, the reactor effluent used to provide cooling may be passed through a pressure reducing valve prior to its entry isto the various condensers. The pressure is reduced suffi ciently to permit vapourisation and to effect create cooling ill the condenser. The pressure may bc reduced to a pressure of 0.070 to 3.5 megabarye absolute. It is preferred to reduce this pressure from .21 megabarye gauge to .35 megabarye gaugc. Example 1 and Comparative Example A A computer simulation was made of an alkylation process as depicted in the Hydrocarbon Processing reference of September, 1974, page 206. Sulfuric acid was used as the acid catalyst. The reactant feed te both examples was 310,850 litres per stream day LPSD being a combination of isobutane, butylene and iner alkanes. For comparison, the amount of product and its octane number were held constant for both examples.Due to the larger amounts of inert alkanes that are recycled in the effluent refrigeration stream of te present invention, the isobutane olefin ratio in the reactor increased when compared to the art. The other operating conditions of the reactor were the same for both examples. Comparative Example A shows the present art.The reactor effluent after acid separation was used to cool the reactor. After cooling, the effluent stream was sent to the first vapour liquid separator. Tie liquid from this separator constituted the stream tiijt was treated and sent as feed to the deisobutaniser column. Cooling water was used as the cooling meQ in the overhead condenser of this column. The vat ours from tile vapour liquid separator were compressed aiid condensed and used as feed to the depropaniser. Cooling water was used as the cooling medium in the overhead condenser of tlie depropaniser.Steam was used as an external heating source to both c o 1 umn s . In Example I, according to the present invention, the reactor effluent was sent in a parallel manner to the overhead condensers of the deisobutaniser and deropaniser columns. After cooling, the reactor effluent was collected in the first vapour liquid separator. The compressed vapours from the vapour liquid separator were used to supply the total heat to the depropaniser column. The vapours also supplied partial heat to the deisobutaniser column by using a side reboiler. The compressor discharge pressure using the present invention was 10.0 megabarye absolute. The reboiler temperatures for the depropaniser and the deisobutaniser columns were 1270F and 1950F respectively. The results of these two experiments are shown in the following table.

The feed to the deisobutaniser column decreased from 1,621,650 to 996,300 litres per stream day. This reduction in feed allowed for a much smaller column. The cooling function of the invention allowed the tower to be operated at a much lower pressure 2.4 megabarye absolute and resulted in a 66 reduction in the total heat necessary to this column. The Table also shows that the heat from the compressed vapours can now supply a large amount of the heat necessary to reboil this column. Although the feed to the depropaniser increased due to the increased amount of vapours produced, use of the cooling function of the invention allowed the tower pressure to be reduced from 17.5 to 7 megabarye absolute. This substantial reduction in pressure allowed the use of the compressed vapours to supply heat to this column. As the Table shows, all of the heat required by the depropaniser column can be supplied from the compressed vapours. Of primary importance is the fact that the total heat to the process from an external source was reduced by 66 .
