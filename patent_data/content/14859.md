# Apparatus for separating a solid or viscous liquid component from a mixture.

## Abstract
A separation apparatus 10 for handling a mixture with a readily flowable liquid component 29 of slightly greater specific gravity, for example separating a heavy viscous grease from water. A preferred form of apparatus comprises an upright cylindrical tank 11 including a central cylindrical core 14 and an outer wall between which a separation chan nel is defined. The channel has a spiral ramp 12 defining its base and is swept by an upright skimmer paddle 24 driven for rotation about the axis of the tank 11 . Two apertures are provided in the ramp 12 , the first aperture 30 having a trap door 32 which is normally biassed open and which is closed by impact from a mass of the viscous or solid compo nents 28 as it is swept up the ramp. The liquid component 29 tends to precede the solid or viscous liquid component and so has reached the trap door 32 before it closes and discharges through this first aperture. The trap door is then closed by the solid or viscous material which then proceeds up the ramp and is discharged to the second aperture 13 . The skimmer paddle 24 there drops suddenly into the second aperture 13 and is then rapidly forced upwardly by a cam track 36 to flick the solid or viscous component 28 off the paddle 24 . The apparatus is intended particularly for use in separating grease having metal contamination from the treatment water used for wet blasting of components.
