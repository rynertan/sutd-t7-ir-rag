# Energy feed system for a microwave oven.

## Abstract
An energy feed system for microwave ovens includes a rotatable slotted disc 24 arranged within the oven cavity 10 in front of a feeding aperture 22 in a cavity wall 11 . The disc 24 is essentially larger than the feeding aperture 22 and arranged at a small distance from the cavity wall 11 so that a narrow space 42 is formed between this wall 11 and the disc 24 , through which narrow space 42 micro wave energy can propagate radially outwardly. The disc 24 comprises a number of slots 27 29, 46 51 , which are oriented transversally to their respective radial position vectors and are dimensioned so as to serve as antenna elements for radiating energy into the interior of the oven cavity 10 . Furthermore, the disc 24 is journalled eccentric ally so as to perform simultaneously a rotational and a translational motion and the narrow space 42 between the disc 24 and the cavity wall 11 is also utilized for guiding an air stream to impinge on vanes 30 32, 44, 45 secured to the lower side of the disc 24 so as to cause the disc 24 to rotate in a predetermined direction.
