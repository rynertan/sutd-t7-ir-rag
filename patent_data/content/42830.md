# Weft feeler unit for a fluid jet loom.

## Abstract
On an electrode pair 2a, 2b type weft feeler unit for a fluid jet loom, electric connection between electrodes 2a, 2b due to electric discharge to be caused by use of high electric voltage is assimilated to electric connection caused by direct contact of a normally inserted weft with the electrodes in order to enable reliable detection of weft insertion even when a high twist yarn is used for the weft.
