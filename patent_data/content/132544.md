## Description
HYDROHALOGENATION OF CONJUGATED DIENES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The invention relates to processes for the hydro 1 halogenation of conjugated diene hydrocarbons. Brief Description of the Prior Art The literature is replete with descriptions of processes for the hydrohalogenation of conjugated dienes. Representative of such descriptions are those found in the U. S. Patents 2,882,323 and 3,016,408 and in British Patent 896,262. The present invention is particularly advantageous when used to hydrochlorinate myrcene. Myrcene is a conjugated diene of the formula EMI1.1 When hydrochlorinated in the absence of any catalyst, the major product is myrcenyl chloride. However, the commercially valuable products of myrcene hydrochlorination are the associated co products, namely, geranyl chloride and neryl chloride. Hydrochlorination in the presence of a copper catalyst shifts the reaction in favor of the desired co products.It has been postulated that the hydrochlorination of myrcene in the presence of a copper catalyst proceeds according to the reaction scheme EMI2.1 tb partial tb SEP i SEP somerization tb SEP cl SEP SEP ci tb SEP Cl SEP Ci SEP SEP I tb SEP I SEP I SEP I tb SEP myrcene SEP geranyl SEP neryl SEP linalyl tb SEP I SEP chloride SEP chloride SEP chloride tb SEP 1 SEP 11 SEP III SEP IV tb SEP L tb SEP Cl SEP l SEP Cl tb I tb SEP dichlorides SEP alpha terpinyl tb SEP chloride tb SEP V SEP VI tb Cyclization may also undesirably occur to form the akha terpinyl chlorides. When the copper catalyst employed is in the form of cupric chloride CuCl2 the products generally include substantial proportions of linalyl chloride and lesser proportions of the desired geranyl and neryl chlorides. When the copper catalyst is in the form of cuprous chloride, the linalyl chloride product is lessened due, apparently, to partial isomerization to the desired geranyl and neryl chlorides. From the above proposed reaction scheme, it will beI appreciated that any process for hydrochlorination of myrcene, to be commercially feasible, must result in a favorable yield of the desired geranyl II and neryl III monochlorides and minimal formation of linalyl IV and alpha terpinyl VI monochlorides. It was previously appreciated that the relative proportions of monochlorides it , III and IV in the hydrochlorination product reaction mixture could be controlled to some degree by I selection of the reaction temperature, gas flowrate and catalyst concentration. We have now found that when the prior art hydrohalogenation of a conjugated diene, such as theI hydrochlorination of isoprene and in particular the hydrochlorination of myrcene, is carried out in the presence of an organic quaternary salt, then the isomerization of the allylic chloride products during the hydrohalogenation reaction is shifted to favor formation of the lesssubstituted allylic chloride, being geranyl chloride II and neryl chloride III in the above example. The advantages associated with the improved process of the invention are improved overall yield of the more desirable chloride, for example prenyl chloride from isoprene and neryl and geranyl chlorides from myrcene, and for the latter case, a greater selectivity of the more important geranyl isomer.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe invention comprises, in a method for the hydudelogenation of a conjugated diene which comprises, hydrohalogenating the diene in the presence of a catalytic proportion of a hydrohalogenation catalyst, the improvement which ccpnprises carrying out the hydrohalogenation in the presence of an organic quaternary salt.The improved process of the invention may be carried out in a batch or a continuous manner.In an improved embodiment the organic guaternary salt has a carbon atom content of at least 18 whereby especially preferred are trioctylmethylammonium chloride, a mixture of tri alkyl methylammonium chlorides where the alkyl portion comprises of a chain of from eight to ten carbon atoms, benzyldimethylstearylammonium chloride, benzylhydroxyethyl 2 coco imidazolium chloride, tetra octadecyl ammonium chloride, N,N cetylethylmorpholinium ethosulfate and trioctylmethylammonium chloride.Especially preferred as dienes are myrcene, isoprene and ocimene and in this case the halogen is chlorine and the catalyst is a copper catalyst.The process is especially carried out at a temperature from about 300C to 500C.The preferred catalyst is cuprous chloride.The catalytic proportion of copper catalyst should be within the weight range of 0.01 to 10.0 percent of the dry diene, and the hydrohalogenation is especially carried out for a period of from 3 to 15 hours.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGThe accompanying drawing is a schematic representation of a preferred embodiment process of the invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERREDEMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTIONThe process of the invention may be employed for the hydrohalogenation of any conjugated diene. Representative of such dienes are myrcene, isoprene, 2 methylpiperylene, beta phellandrene, 2 ethylbutadiene, ocimene, alloocimene, l phenylbutadiene, and the like. The method of the invention is particularly advantageous for the hydrohalogenation of myrcene to obtain the geranyl and neryl halides which are intermediates for the manufacture of commercially valuable geraniol and nerol.When applied to myrcene, the improved method of the invention will increase the overall yield of the geranyl and neryl halides by at least Il to 12 mole percent over the prior art processes and will improve selectivity of the ratio of geranyl isomer to the neryl isomer from about 1.3 to 1.6. Commercially available myrcene made by pyrolysis of beta pinene, purified forms of myrcene, and myrcene isolated from natural materials may be provided as the starting material in the preferred process of the invention. The accompanying drawing is a schematic representation of a preferred embodiment method of the invention for the hydrochlorination of inyrcene. As shown in the Figure the provided myrcene initially held in tank 10 may be first dried in a conventional salt bed dryer 20 to remove water, as necessary. The dried myrcene is then preferably cooled to a temperature in the range of from about 300C. to about 300C. most preferably circa lO0C. in a cooling unit 30.Alternatively, the myrcene may be cooled first and then processed through a salt bed dryer 20 to remove water.Cooling the starting myrcene prior to drying in the salt bed dryer 20 is somewhat advantageous in that pre cooling increases drying efficiency in the salt bed dryer 20. As shown in the Figure the dried and cooled myrcene starting material may be passed into a hydrohalogenation apparatus which comprises in the preferred embodiment a stirred tank reactor 40. In reactor 40, hydrohaloyenation of the introduced myrcene is carried out in the presence of a catalytic proportion of a hydrohalogenation catalyst, at a temperature within the range of from about 300C. to about 50 C. preferably at a temperature within the range of from lO0C. to 250C., most preferably about 100C. Hydrohalogenation may be effected, for example, by reaction of the myrcene with a hydrogen halide like hydrogen chloride or hydrogen bromide, preferably in substantially anhydrous form and under substantially anhydrous conditions, i.e. having less than about 5 water present in the reaction mixture.As shown in the Figure, the preferred hydrohalogenation is with gaseous hydrogen chloride which is introduced as a gas possibly generated in a vaporizer, and then metered into the reactor 40, via appropriate conduits. Advantageously, the hydrogen chloride is metered into the reactor 40 at a rate of from about 2.0 to about 300 gms hour mole of myrcene present in the reactor 40. Preferably, the rate is from about 4.0 to 8.0 gms hour mole of myrcene. The organic quaternary salt is introduced into the reactor 40 from storage vessel 50. Myrcene, quaternary salt, hydrogen chloride and copper catalyst are introduced into the reactor 40 sequentially. Preferably, the reactor 40 after purging with an inert gas such as nitrogen is first charged with the cool myrcene, the copper catalyst, and the organic quaternary salt. While cooling and stirring, the hydrogen chloride is added incrementally to the charge. A wide variety of catalysts for hydrohalogenation of myrcene are well known and include, for example, any copper compound having a valency of 2 or less, including metallic copper. Any copper compound convertible to the halide such as the bromide, iodide or chloride under conditions of the reaction may also be used. Representative of copper catalysts advantageously employed are the chloride, bromide, carbonate, oxide, acetate, formate, sulfate, and like derivative cupric and cuprous compounds. Preferred as the hydrochlorination catalyst in the improved process of the invention is cuprous chloride.

Representative of hydrocarbyl are alkyl of 1 to 25 carbon atoms, inclusive, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, undecyl, decyl, dodecyl, octadecyl, nonodecyl, eicosyl, heneicosyl, docosyl, tricosyl, tetracosyl, pentacosyl and the isomeric forms thereof aryl of 6 to 25 carbon atoms, inclusive, such as phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, naphthyl, biphenyl, tetraphenyl and the like aralkyl of 7 to 25 carbon atoms, inclusive, such as benzyl, phenethyl, phenpropyl, phenbutyl, phenhexyl, napthoctyl and the like cycloalkyl of 3 to 8 carbon atoms, inclusive, such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl and the like alkenyl of 2 to 25 carbon atoms, inclusive, such as vinyl, allyl, butenyl, pentenyl, hexenyl, octenyl, nonenyl, decenyl, undececyl, dodecenyl, tridecenyl, pentadecenyl, octadecenyl, pentacosynyl and isomeric forms thereof. The term alkenylene means the divalent moiety obtained on removal of two hydrogen atoms, each from a non adjacent carbon atom of a parent hydrocarbon and includes alkenylene of 3 to 10 carbon atoms, inclusive, such as 1,3 propenylene, 1,4 butenylene, 1,5 pentenylene, 1,8 octenylene, l,10 decenylene and the like. The terms substituted hydrocarbyl and substituted alkenylene as used herein mean the hydrocarbyl or alkenylene moiety as previously defined wherein one or more hydrogen atoms have been replaced with an inert group, i.e.a chemical group which does not adversely affect the desired function of the organic quaternary salt of formula VII .Representative of such groups are aminophosphino , hydrocarbyl, quaternary nitrogen ammonium , quaternary phosphorus phosphonium , hydroxyl , alkoxy, mercapto , alkyl, halo , phosphate, phosphite, carboxylate groups and the like. Organic guaternary compounds of the formula VII given above are generally well known as are methods of their preparation. Representative of such organic quaternary compounds are trioctylmethylammonium chloride, tetraoctadecylammonium chloride, dodecyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride, tetradecyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride, hexadecyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride, trimethylcarboxymethylammonium chloride, triethylgeranylammonium chloride, triethylnerylammonium chlorideN,N cetylethylmorpholinium ethosulfate, methyl l cocoamido ethyl 2 cocoimidazolinium methyl sulfate, N tallowpentamethylpropanediammonium dichloride, trioctylmethylphosphonium bromide, N,N soya ethylmorpholinium ethosulfate, hexadecylpyridinium chloride, triethylbenzylammonium chloride, benzyl hydroxyethyl 2 cocoimidazolinium chloride, tripropylgeranylammonium chloride, tributylgeranylammonium chloride, dodecyldimethyl ethylbenzyl ainmonium chloride, tetradecyldimethyl ethylbenzyl ammonium chloride, hexadecyldimethyl ethylbenzyl ammonium chloride, octadecyldimethyl ethylbenzyl ammonium chloride octadecyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride, methyl bis 2 hydroxyethyl cocoammonium chloride, methyl l soyaamidoethyl 2 soyaimidazolinium methyl sulfate, methyl l tallowamidoethyl 2 tallow imidazolinium methyl sulfate, methyl l oleylamidoethyl 2 oleylimidazolinium methyl sulfate and the like. Commercially available quaternary salts or purified forms of quaternary salts may be used in the preferred process of the invention. It will be appreciated that under specific conditions of operating the process of the invention, certain of the above described compounds of the formula VII given above have advantages over other catalysts of the same general formula. Selection of a particular compound VII for use under specific process conditions, for optimum yields may be made by trial and error technique. We have observed however that there are advantages associated with a mixture of trialkylmethylammonium chlorides where the alkyl portion consists of a chain of from eight to ten carbon atoms. For example, Adogen 464 Sherex Chemical Co. and Aliquat 336 Henkel Corp. . The organic quaternary salt is used in a proportion to I isomerize, during the hydrohalogenation reaction, at least some of the more substituted allylic chloride produced in the method of the invention. Such a proportion is generally within the range of from about 0.01 to 10 percent by weight of the diene charge, preferably 0.2 to 2.5 percent. Optimum proportions will depend to some extent upon the salt selected and may be determined by trial and error technique. The controlling reaction rate in the hydrohalogenationI process of the invention is the isomerization of the more substituted halide to the desired less substituted halide. This is controlled by residence time in the hydrohalogenation reaction zone. We have found that in hydrochlorination of myrcene, the preferred minimum total residence time is within the range of from 3 to 15 hours, and most preferably 5 to 8 hours under the above described operating temperatures. The presence of linalyl chloride in the reaction mixture may be monitored by conventional analytical techniques. Longer residence times in the hydrochlorination reactor may cause a yield loss due to conversion of the monochlorides to alpha terpinyl chloride.Shorter residence times may not be sufficient to isomerize the linalyl chloride to the desired geranyl neryl chlorides. When it has been determined that hydrohalogenation has occurred to a maximum desired point, the hydrohalogenation product mixture is passed from the hydrohalogenation apparatus. The desired hydrohalogenated diene may be separated from the reaction mixture employing conventional and known techniques including washing, decantation, distillation and like techniques.
