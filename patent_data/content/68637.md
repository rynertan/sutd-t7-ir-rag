# METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR CONTROLLING MULTI ZONE REHEATING FURNACES

## Abstract
A method and system is provided for controlling a reheating furnace having entrance and discharge ends, a preheating zone at the entrance end, and heating and soaking zones sequentially adjacent the preheating zone in the direction toward the discharge end, and an ex haust gas flue at the entrance end. The method and control system provides for obtaining an optimum tem perature profile through the preheating and heating zones with minimum fuel consumption in connection with operation of the preheating zone by controlling the fuel supply to the preheating zone in accordance with the rate or quantity of fuel flow to the heating zone and the temperature of the exhaust gas from the furnace.
