# Method and apparatus for heat treating pulverulent raw material.

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus for calcining pulverulent raw material, in particular cement raw meal, wherein the material is calcined suspended in a stream of hot gas in a calcining zone 4 in an overheated atmosphere by burning fuel in a steam of oxygen containing gas in the zone, and precipitated in a precipitation zone 9 . The rate of combustion of the fuel is accelerated by maintaining a temperature within the range 900 1250 C in the calcining zone by dividing the raw material into two streams 22 ,22 introducing and calcining only the first stream of material 22 in the calcination chamber 4 . The temperature of the hot suspension withdrawn from the calcining zone is reduced by 100 300 C to a level within the range 800 1000 C by suspending the second stream of material 22 in the hot suspension during withdrawal thereof from the calcination chamber 4 and before the calcined material is precipitated in the precipitator 9 .
