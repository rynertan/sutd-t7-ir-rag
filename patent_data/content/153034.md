## Description
The present invention relates to a luminance color signal separation filter and a method of luminance color separation. More particularly, it relates to a luminance color signal separation filter and a method of luminance color signal separation wherein a luminance signal or a color signal is extracted from a PAL system composite video signal by converting the PAL system composite video signal in the form of an analog signal into a digital signal thereby to digitally separate the digitized signal into a luminance signal and a color signal. Fig. 1 is a schematic block diagram showing the structure of a conventional luminance color signal separation filter of a digital system. The structure of the conventional separation filter is now described with reference to Fig. 1. An analog composite video signal of the PAL system is supplied to an A D converter 1. The A D converter 1 converts the composite video signal into a digital signal, to supply the same to a vertical filter 2. The vertical filter 2 extracts a line alternating signal including high frequency components of a vertical direction and the color signal from the digital signal converted by the A D converter 1. The output signal from the vertical filter 2 is supplied to a band pass filter 3. The band pass filter 3 removes the horizontal low frequency components from the output signal of the vertical filter 2 to extract the color signal. The color signal output from the band pass filter 3 is supplied to a subtractor 5. The luminance signal output from the vertical filter 2 is delayed by a delay circuit 4 and then supplied to the subtractor 5. The delay circuit 4 delays the luminance signal for the period by which the color signal is delayed by the band pass filter 3. The subtractor 5 calculates the difference between the output signal from the band pass filter 3 and that from the delay circuit 4 so as to extract the luminance signal. Operation of the luminance color signal separation filter as shown in Fig. 1 is now described. The analog composite video signal of the PAL system is digitized by the A D converter 1 into a digital signal series S i,j i 1,2, ..., m, j 1, 2, ..., n based on a predetermined sampling frequency f The output signal from the vertical filter 2 is supplied to the band pass filter 3 so that the horizontal low frequency components of the luminance signal are removed, so as to obtain the color signal component of the signal sample. The luminance signal is obtained as the difference between the output signal from the delay circuit 4 and the color signal obtained from the band pass filter 3. In other words, the output from the band pass filter 3 constitutes the color signal, and the luminance signal is generated by the subtractor 5. In such a conventional luminance color signal separation filter the energy of the horizontal high frequency components of the luminance signal is increased when the video signal includes changes in the horizontal direction. As a result, the separation of the luminance signal and the color signal is degraded, a part of the color signal component being mixed with the generated luminance signal. Similarly, when the video signal includes changes in the vertical direction, the luminance signal energy outside the band of the above described vertical filter increases, and hence the luminance color separation becomes impaired. US 4,399,454 describes a luminance color signal separation filter for separating the luminance and color components of a digitized composite video signal. This luminance color signal separation filter comprises converter means for sampling an analog composite video signal at an even multiple of a colour sub carrier frequency for converting the same into a digital signal filter means for removing luminance signal components included in said digital signal by combining in a predetermined manner at least two of a plurality of signal samples comprising a test signal sample associated with a first position on the video screen and comparison signal samples associated with respective positions on the video screen in the vicinity of said first position, thereby deriving a combination signal which approximates to the colour component of said test signal sample, said filter means comprising first combining means and second combining means for calculating different combinations of said signal samples, thereby to derive respectively a first combination signal and a second combination signal and selection means for selecting between at least said first and second combining means, in order to determine which combination signal is to be selected as an output of the filter. However, the purpose of this filter is to compare signals of one frame with corresponding signals of the subsequent frame. In order to effect such a comparison, the phase of each color component within the one frame needs to be adjusted so as to correspond with the phase of each corresponding color component within the subsequent frame, since the color signal phase is different for signals within consecutive frames. This system therefore approximates the color components of a signal sample by combining the signals of vertically adjacent sample points i.e. sample points separated from the signal sample by one complete scanning line with those of the sample points separated horizontally from these vertically adjacent sample points by two sample points. The choice of sample points is dictated by the need to produce a color signal having the same phase as that of the signal sample of the subsequent frame. This patent also discloses the detection of motion within a video frame, this being defined as the existence of a difference between the video signals within the lines directly above and directly below that of the signal sample. When such vertical motion is detected, only those signals within one of the two vertically adjacent lines are used to generate the desired signal when no such motion is detected, signals from both lines are used. However, there is no provision for sensing such motion in any other direction, and, in the event of such motion occurring, the resultant luminance color separation will be impaired. It follows that there is no provision for comparing such motion in two different directions and selecting the signals on the basis of such a comparison. US 4,232,330 describes a luminance color separation filter wherein digitized signals from adjacent lines are compared to effect the desired separation. However, there is no provision for selecting comparison sample points on the basis of signal values, and consequently there is no provision for mitigating the effects of changes in the video signal in either the horizontal or the vertical direction. Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a luminance color signal separation filter which correlates a signal sample with neighbouring sampled points in both the vertical and horizontal directions of the video screen and which uses the result of the correlation to effect an improved approximation of a component of the signal sample thereby to improve the luminance color separation. According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a luminance color signal separation filter as defined by claim 1 hereinbelow. According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of luminance color signal separation as defined by claim 12 hereinbelow. According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a luminance color signal separation filter as defined by claim 13 hereinbelow. Therefore, the luminance signal and the color signal can be separated from each other by employment of the signals associated with the direction in which the composite video signal changes less, and hence separation of the luminance signal and the color signal can be performed with reduced degradation of resolution caused by sharp changes in the pictorial image, whereby the received image can be reproduced with reduced cross color interference and cross luminance interference. The above and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken into conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein Fig. 2 is an illustration showing arrangement of sample extracted picture elements of a PAL system video signal on a one field screen. In general, a composite video signal P of the PAL system is composed of a luminance signal Y and a color signal C obtained by quadrature two phase modulation of two color difference signals U and V or I and Q at a color subcarrier frequency f With respect to the mark in the third term of the above equation, the mark indicates an odd number scanning line and the mark indicates an even number scanning line in the above described composite video signal P. In other words, V components are inverted every scanning line. Assuming that the frame frequency is represented by f Thus, the aforementioned color subcarrier frequency f A normal video signal has such a characteristic that correlation between horizontally and vertically adjacent samples is strong. Therefore, the color signal can be separated from the luminance signal by employing the aforementioned sampled values S i 2, j , S i 2, j , S i, j 2 and S i, j 2 with respect to the sampled value S i, j . Fig. 3 is a schematic block diagram showing an embodiment of the present invention. Structure of the present embodiment is now described with reference to Fig. 3. A composite video signal is supplied to an A D converter 1. The A D converter 1 is further supplied with sampling pulses of the frequency f The vertical horizontal direction selective filter 11 is formed by first and second buffer memories 61 and 62, first, second and third sample buffer memories 71, 72, and 73, first and second adder circuits 81 and 82, first, second and third multipliers 91, 92 and 93, first, second, third and fourth subtractors 101, 102, 103 and 104, first and second absolute value operators 141 and 142, a comparator 15 and a selection switch 16. The buffer memories 61 and 62 are adapted to delay the inputted digital signal by two horizontal scanning periods, and are formed by, e.g., RAMs. The buffer memories 61 and 62 temporarily store the inputted digital signal and read out the stored digital signal after a predetermined period of time, i.e., two horizontal scanning periods from the time of storing thereby to delay the inputted digital signal. The sample buffer memories 71, 72 and 73 are adapted to delay the inputted digital signal by two sampled points, and are formed by, e.g., RAMs. The sample buffer memories 71, 72 and 73 temporarily store the inputted digital signal and read out the stored digital signal after a predetermined period of time, i.e., two sampled points from the time of storing thereby to delay the digital signal. The adder circuit 81 adds the output from the second buffer memory 62 and the output from the first sample buffer memory 71. The second adder circuit 82 adds the output from the first buffer memory 61 and that from the third sample buffer memory 73. The first and second multipliers 91 and 92 are adapted to multiply the outputs from the adder circuits 81 and 82 by 1 4 respectively. The third multiplier 93 multiplies the output from the second sample buffer memory 72 by 1 2. The first subtractor 101 finds the difference between the output from the third multiplier 98 and that from the first multiplier 91, while the second subtractor 102 finds the difference between the output from the third multiplier 93 and that from the second multiplier 92. The third subtractor 103 finds the difference between the output from the first sample buffer memory 71 and that from the second buffer memory 62. The fourth subtractor 104 finds the difference between the output from the first buffer memory 61 and that from the third sample buffer memory 73. The absolute value operators 141 and 142 include, e.g., exclusive OR circuits and adders, to find the absolute values of the outputs from the third subtractor 103 and the fourth subtractor 104 respectively. The comparator 15 compares the outputs from the first and second absolute value operators 141 and 142, to supply a switching signal to the selection switch 16 as hereafter described. The selection switch 16 receives the switching signal from the comparator 15 to select and output either the output signal from the first subtractor 101 or that from the second subtractor 102 both connected to the selection switch 16, and is formed by, e.g., a multiplexer. Description is now made on operation of the luminance color signal separation filter as shown in Fig. 3. With respect to the signal digitalized by the A D converter 1, a color signal C i, j in the sampled value s i, j of a sampled point i, j in the signal series is found by difference values of vertical direction and horizontal direction employing four sampled values, i.e., sampled values S i, j 2 and S i, j 2 of sampled points i, j 2 and i, j 2 upwardly and downwardly separated by two scanning lines from the sampled point i, j respectively and sampled values S i 2, j and S i 2, j of sampled points i 2, j and i 2, j leftwardly and rightwardly separated by two scanning lines from the same respectively as follows As clearly shown in Fig. 3, the sampled value S i, j is outputted from the second sample buffer memory 72, the sampled value S i, j 2 is outputted from the second buffer memory 62, the sampled value S i, j 2 is outputted from the first sample buffer memory 71, the sampled value S i 2, j is outputted from the third sample buffer memory 73 and the sampled value S i 2, j is outputted from the first buffer memory 61 while the value T On the other hand, vertical and horizontal color signals V As obviously understood from Fig. 3, the above formulas 5 and 6 are obtained in the following manner The sampled value S i, j 2 from the first sample buffer memory 71 and the sampled value S i, j 2 from the second buffer memory 62 are added up by the first adder circuit 81 whereby the value S i, j 2 S i, j 2 is inputted in the first multiplier 91. This value is then multiplied by 1 4 by the first multiplier 91 so that the multiplied value 1 4 S i, j 2 1 4 S i, j 2 is inputted in the first subtractor 101. The sampled value S i, j from the second sample buffer memory 72 is multiplied by 1 2 by the third multiplier 93, whereby the 1 2 multiplied value 1 2 S i, j is inputted in the first subtractor 101. The first subtractor 101 outputs the difference between the values 1 4 S i, j 2 1 4 S i, j 2 and 1 2 S i, j , i.e., the remainder 1 4 S i, j 2 1 2 S i, j 1 4 S i, j 2 H The sampled value S i 2, j from the first buffer memory 61 and the sampled value S i 2, j from the third sample buffer memory 73 are added up by the second adder circuit 82, whereby the value S i 2, j S i 2, j is inputted in the second multiplier 92. This value is multiplied by 1 4 by the second multiplier 92 so that the 1 4 multiplied value 1 4 S i 2, j 1 4 S i 2, j is inputted in the second subtractor 102. The second subtractor 102 outputs the difference between the value 1 4 S i 2, j 1 4 S i 2, j and the value 1 2 S i, j , i.e., the value 1 4 S i 2, j 1 2 S i, j 1 4 S i 2, j V As clearly understood from Fig. 2, S i, j y c₂, S i, j 2 y c₂, S i, j 2 y c₂, S i 2, j y c₂ and S i 2, j y c₂, and hence the signal V The said difference values T When the absolute value T When the absolute value T Namely, difference absolute values of vertical direction and horizontal direction are found employing the sampled values S i, j 2 , S i, j 2 , S i 2, j and S i 2, j in phase inverted sampled positions of the color signal in the vicinity of the noted sampled point i, j , so as to employ two of the sampled values in the direction of smaller high frequency component value for performing the operation as hereinafter described thereby to remove the low frequency components of the luminance signal. Removed as the result are the vertical or horizontal luminance signal components in the noted sampled point i, j , whereby the signal H Further, the luminance signal and the color signal may be separated from each other by operating values of difference between the sampled value S i, j of the sampled point i, j and the sampled values S i 2, j 2 , S i 2, j 2 , S i 2, j 2 and S i 2, j 2 in sampled points i 2, j 2 , i 2, j 2 , i 2, j 2 and i 2, j 2 as Fig. 4 is a block diagram showing another embodiment of the present invention. The embodiment as shown in Fig. 4 is substantially identical to that shown in Fig. 3, except for the following points The first and second buffer memories 61 and 62 as shown in Fig. 3 are replaced by delay circuits 20 and 24 while the first, second and third sample buffer memories 71, 72 and 73 are replaced by delay circuits 21, 22 and 23. Removed is the delay circuit 4 which is provided between the sample buffer memory 72 and the subtractor 5 in Fig. 3. A first absolute value operator 141 is provided in its output with an adder circuit 18, which receives a predetermined constant K from a constant generator circuit 17. The adder circuit 18 adds up the output from the first absolute value operator 141 and the output from the constant generator circuit 17, to supply the summed value to a comparator circuit 15. The first and second delay circuits 20 and 24 are adapted to delay the output from an A D converter 1 by two horizontal scanning periods. The third to fifth delay circuits 21 to 23 delay the same by two sampled values. Fig. 5 illustrates operation of the embodiment as shown in Fig. 4 with symbols given to a part of the sampled series as shown in Fig. 1. With reference to Fig. 5, description is now made on operation of the luminance color signal separation filter as shown in Fig. 4. The A D converter 1 converts the inputted analog composite video signal into a digital signal by sampling pulses received from a sampling pulse generator circuit 19. Arrangement of the sampled series of the PAL system composite video signal sampled by the sampling pulses is as shown in Fig. 1 on the screen. Assuming here that the A D converter 1 outputs the sampled value of a sampled point P9 at given time T, the third delay circuit 21 outputs the sampled value of a sampled point P8 in the vicinity of the sampled point P9. On the other hand, the first delay circuit 20 outputs the sampled value of a sampled point P6 which is delayed by two horizontal scanning lines from the sampled point P9. Further, the fourth delay circuit 22 outputs the sampled value of a sampled point P5 which is in the vicinity of the sampled point P6 and the fifth delay circuit 23 outputs the sampled value of a sampled point P4 in the vicinity of the sampled point P5. The second delay circuit 24 outputs the sampled value of a sampled point P2 which is delayed by two scanning lines from the sampled point P8. A first adder circuit 81 is adapted to add up the output from the first delay circuit 21, i.e., the sampled value of the sampled point P8 and the output from the second delay circuit 24, i.e., the sampled value of the sampled point P2, and a first multiplier circuit 91 multiplies the output from the first adder circuit 81 by 1 4. Another multiplier circuit 93 is adapted to multiply by one half the output from the fourth delay circuit 22, i.e. the sampled value of the sampled point P5. A first subtracter circuit 101 subtracts the output signal of the first multiplier circuit 91 from the output signal of the multiplier circuit 93, and hence the subtracter circuit 101 outputs The output signal T Thus, employed in the embodiment as shown in Fig. 4 are neighboring picture element signals whose color subcarrier phases are inverted for detecting the direction in which the signals are loss changed thereby to separate the color signal from the composite video signal by employing the picture element signals in the said direction, whereby the color signal is correctly separated. Further, the constant K generated by the constant generator circuit 17 is adapted to prevent lowering of the vertical resolution caused by employment of the sampled values of the sampled points upwardly and downwardly separated by two horizontal scanning lines. Therefore, lowering of the vertical resolution can be prevented by setting an appropriate constant K in the constant generator circuit 17. In addition, the subtractor circuit 5 is adapted to subtract the output signal of the selection switch circuit 16 from the output signal of the fourth delay circuit 22. The fourth delay circuit 22 outputs the composite video signal and the selection switch circuit 16 outputs the color signal separated from the composite video signal, and hence the subtractor circuit 5 outputs the luminance signal.
