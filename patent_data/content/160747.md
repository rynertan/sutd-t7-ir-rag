# A dry cement composition and a method for producing the same.

## Abstract
A dry cement composition containing an amount of ferrous sulphate FS for eliminating or substantially reduc ing the content of water soluble chromate, is produced by grinding a starting material C, G in a cement mill, and the ground cement material is passed from the mill to a storage container 33 . The ferrous sulphate in an amount of 0.01 10 and preferably 0.4 percent by weight is added to and mixed with the starting material in a dry or non dissolved condition at a location or at locations upstreams of the storage conatiner 33 . The ferrous sulphate is a particulate material, the particles of which are provided with an oxidation preventing coating. the ferrous sulphate is preferably added to the starting material upstream of the cement mill.
