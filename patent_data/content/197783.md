# OSTOMY APPLIANCE

## Abstract
For any ostomy appliance, a body side ostomy member includes a medical grade adhesive pad and a coupling having one part captive to but telescopically slidable relative to another part to provide access for the fingers or thumb of a wearer beneath a lateral flange of the coupling, when the parts are spaced from one another. This allows an ostomy coupling to be secured together without applying undue pressure to the sensitive body area of the wearer.
