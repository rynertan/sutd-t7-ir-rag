# Controlling steam temperature to turbines.

## Abstract
An entrained bed combustor may provide constant temperature, superheated steam to a power generating steam turbine independent of the load on the turbine. Fine particles are heated in the combustor 10 . A selected first portion of those heated fine particles is directed to a steam generator 17 and a selected second portion of those fine particles is directed to a superheater 18 . This enables faster start up and a turn down capability without a reduction in the superheated steam temperature.
