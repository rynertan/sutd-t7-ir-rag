# Polymer blends.

## Abstract
Polymer blends containing i 0.2 95 by weight of a high molecular weight β hydroxybutyric acid homo or copolymer and ii a polymer containing at least 25 by weight of chlorine or nitrile groups, such as chlorinated polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, or a high acrylonitrile resin. In small quantities the β hydroxybutyric acid polymer acts as a processing aid for the chlorine or nitrile containing polymer. In larger quantities the properties of the β hydroxy butyric acid polymer or the chlorine or nitrile containing polymer are improved.
