# Information holding device comprising a multi layer Langmuir Blodgett film.

## Abstract
A memory comprises a multilayer Langmuir Blodgett film 1 in which each layer 2 is capable of carrying a charge. A photo injector layer D is located on one side of the film for introducing charges into the film in a time sequence which corresponds to the information to be carried. Means 6 are provided for applying a voltage between the faces of the film to cause the charge carried by any layer to be transferred to the adjacent layer. The sequence of charges carried by the film may be read out by a photon emitting electron ar rival detector F on the opposite side of the film, or by a method of current differentiation. Tie film 1 is preferably formed of a polydiacetylene.
