# DRIVING SYSTEM FOR PLASMA PANEL DISPLAY SYSTEM

## Abstract
A driving system for a plasma panel display which uses VFETs for output switches controls the transition time of an output waveform 95 to a constant time. Transformerless circuitry 110, 130 for communicating low voltage digital logic signals across a floating boundary to VFET control circuitry is provided. Low voltage control circuitry 120, 140 is isolated from high voltage sources by semiconductor circuitry which eliminates the need for transformer isolation techniques. In an alternative embodiment, the transition of an output waveform is controlled at a constant slew rate.
