## Description
MULTI FUNCTION ELECTRICITY BILLING METER Technical Field This invention relates to electricity metering and more particularly relates to a solid state electricity revenue meter which generates a multiplicity of different functions or quantities which are useful in determining the cost of the electrical energy supplied to a customer. Background Art In the electrical energy industry the various quantitative measuresments which determine customer billing are traditionally obtained from a variety of different devices. Each device is designed and constructed to meter a particular quantity. For example, the historic Ferraris rotating meter is used in a variety of forms to measure real energy or reactive energy KVAR and with uniquely designed attachments, to measure related power demand quantities. Kw and KVAR transducers when coupled with appropriate integrating means are also used for these purposes. Inherent in the electromechanical structure or electronic circuitry of each such device are the mathematical operations which are necessary to determine the particular quantity. For example, the rotating Ferraris meter inherently provides a cumulative total number of output revolutions which is proportional to the product of current, voltage, the cosine of the angle between thew and time in hours. Similarly, a KUAR transducer provides an output which is proportional to the product of voltage, current and the sine of the angle between them. With conventional technology a power company orders and installs those devices or transducers which provide the quantities which are desired. Some manufacturers have combined more than one type of transducer into an aggregation of such devices in a single piece of equipment which may also have additional features. Patent 4,218,737 shows two different transducers combined in a circuit which converts each of their outputs to digital form and then processes, stores, communicates and displays the processed data. Brief Disclosure of the Invention This invention has no transducer or device which directly generates any of the functions or quantities which are used for billing purposes. Instead, the present invention provides.electronic solid state circuitry which samples the basic analog quantities of instantaneous current and instantaneous voltage as they appear in the power distribution system at some interconnection terminal, such as between a power line and the energy consuming equipment of the customer. Those current and voltage samples are converted directly to digital form. Data signals representing the voltage and the current samples are then processed by a data processing unit to provide the desired quantities, such as for example total kilowatt hours, peak kilowatt demand, total kilovar hours, average kilovars, peak KVA demand, total KVA hours, kilowatt and KUA demand peak average, power factor average, power factor at demand peak, total KQh, etc. One advantage of the invention is that a single meter can be installed to obtain numerous revenue related readings where several conventional meters and attachments have otherwise traditionally been required. The computing portion of a meter embodying the invention may be provided with interchangeable or replaceable ROMs which contain data representing the current rate structure for a particular company and a sp ecific customer. The circuitry of the present invention permits a unit to be constructed which meters all the quantities which are desired for revenue billing purposes with a single unit which is physically and electrically compatible with conventional Ferraris meters so that a meter embodying the invention may directly replace one or more traditional Ferraris meters without requiring any other modification of the customers preexisting installation. Brief Description of the Drawings Fig. 1 is a block diagram illustrating the preferred embodiment of the invention. Fig. 2 is an oscillogram illustrating the sampling technique used in the operation of the preferred embodiment. Fig. 3 is a table of equations illustrating the data processing which is used to convert the voltage and current samples to some of the most commonly used metering quantities. In describing the preferred embodiment of the invention which is illustrated in the drawings, specific terminology will be resorted to for the sake of clarity. However, it is not intended that the invention be limited to the specific terms so selected and it is to be understood that each specific term includes all technical equivalents which operate in a similar manner to accomplish a similar purpose. For example, the word connected or terms similar thereto are often used. They are not limited to direct connection but include connection through other circuit elements where such connection is recognized as being equivalent by those skilled in the art. Detailed Description of the Best Mode Referring to Fig. 1, electrical power from a distribution system is provid ed to some interconnection terminal 10 and from the interconnection terminal 10 is supplied to the energy consuming equipment of the customer. While interconnection terminal 10 may be either custom designed or a conventional type, usually it is either an S type mounting for socket connection to a Ferraris type meter or an A type mounting for direct connection of the line and the load conductors. An isolation and signal level conversion means 12 has its input connected to the interconnection terminal 10 and provides at its output a plurality of analog signals which are proportional to the instantaneous voltage and current of the phases of the power line. Preferably, these are conventional transformers which provide isolation and reduce the voltage and current signals to a workable level which is compatible with solid state circuitry. The present invention will operate with single and multiphase power distribution systems. In a single phase system there will be one or two current transformers and one or two voltage transformers. However, for a conventional threephase system, the isolation and signal level conversion means 12 will consist of two or three voltage stepdown transformers and two or three current transformers. Therefore, in the threephase system the output of the isolation and signal level conversion means will consist of two or three output current signals which are proportional to the instantaneous currents of the power distribution system at the interconnection terminal 10 and two or three voltage signals which are proportional to the three voltages of the three phase system at the interconnection terminal 10. The output of the isolation and signal level conversion means 12 is applied to an analog to digital converter or A D conversion means 14. The analog to digital conversion means 14 is controlled by a central processing unit 16. The A D conversion means 14 converts the analog signals which are applied to its input, such as the three current and three instantaneous voltage signals for a three phase system to digital data signals representing instantaneous values of the voltages and of the currents for the three phases. Thus, for example, the output of the A D conversion means 14 for a three phase system might consist of three current and three voltage data words which are applied to the data portion of a data, address and control bus 18 in accordance with conventional data processing design principles. The central processing unit 15 is also connected through the bus 18 to a RAM memory 20, a display 22, a programmable read only memory or PROM 24 and a second PROM 26. Two PROMs 24 and 26 are used so that the PROM 24 may be permanently in stalled and contains instructions and data which are common to usage of the nulti function revenue meter by all users. The PROM 26, however, is replaceable and contains instructions and data for a particular installation. The bus 18 is also connected to data recording mechanisms such as tapes, discs, and solid state memories which may be referred to as a data recorder 28 and to conventional interfacing circuitry 30 to permit transmission of the data through a communication system. A system timer 32 is connected to the bus 18 and may be connected to the A D conversion means 14 depending upon the type of A D converter used. A real time calendar clock 34 is also connected to the bus 18 and is needed for computing the time based quantities. The manner of connecting a central processor through a bus to associated RAM and ROM memories, output devices and the other described elements is well known to those skilled in the art and therefore is not disclosed in further detail. Similarly since a variety of A D conversion means have been described in the prior art, the particular circuit used in the present invention is not described in detail. However, it is preferred that the digital conversion means 14 be of the sample and hole type. Preferably a plurality of angularly spaced samples are taken at different angular positions along the approximately sinusoidal signals representing the voltages and current described above. Each voltage sample is taken simultaneously with an associated current sample so that the samples are obtained as simultaneous pairs. In a three phase system the samples are taken as three simultaneous sets of simultaneous i and v pairs. Fig. 2 illustrates a typical, approximately sinusoidal, instantaneous current or voltage signal 40. It is preferred that eight samples of the signal be taken for each cycle of the 50Hz or 60Hz power signal. The samples are specifically, angularly spaced along the cycle. Subsequent sample sets may not be angularly coincident with the preceding sample sets but will also be specifically angularly spaced along the cycle.Preferably the samples are uniformly angularly spaced. However, since one cycle of 60Hz power has a period of approximately 17 milliseconds, all eight samples are not taken during the same cycle. Because the signal is periodic, the samples can be taken during subsequent, representative repetitive cycles at specific, angularly spaced positions in the cycle. For example, the first sample may be taken at 450 following the positive going zerorcrossover of one cycle. The second sample 0 might be taken 90 after the positive going zero crossover of the first subsequent cycle and the third sample taken 1350 after the positive going zero crossover of the second subsequent cycle and so forth and so on. In this manner the samples are taken at an integral number of phase angles which are specifically angularly spaced along representative repetitive cycles of each of the current and voltage analog signals from the amplitude reduction means 12. For each of the samples, for example the eight samples, representing a sample set, illustrated in Fig. 2, a digital data word is provided at the output of the A D conversion means 14. Thus, in a three phase system 48 such data words will be utilized to represent the voltage and current samples for the three phases. The table of Fig. 3 illustrates how these samples are processed by the central processing unit 16 for computing some of the more common quantities used in revenue metering. For example, real energy may be computed for the time interval over which the sample is taken. It is computed for each phase by summing the products of each voltage sample and its simultaneously taken current sample for all of the eight sample positions then dividing that sum by the number of samples, such as eight. This is done for each phase and then the three results are summed. The computed increment of real energy is then stored in memory along with data representing the time at which the quantity was determined. The same computing techniques may be applied to the other conventional revenue metering quantities for which there are standard definitions and Elgebraic statements well known to those skilled in the art, Similarly, the mathematical statements defining other quantities and algorithms based on rate structure may be implemented by the processor and its associated memories and the date may be displayed and or communicated as desired It is to be understood that while the detailed drawings and specific examples given describe preferred embodiments of the invention, they are for the purposes of illustration only, that the apparatus of the invention is not limited to the precise details and conditions disclosed and that various changes may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention which is defined by the following claims.
