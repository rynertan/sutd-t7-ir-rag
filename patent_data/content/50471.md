# Polymer blends.

## Abstract
Thermoplastic compositions comprising blends of dissi milar plastics and dissimilar cured particulate rubbers in which the plastics are crystalline polyolefin polymer and nylon, and the cured particulate rubbers are hydrocarbon rubber and po lar rubber, include a functionalized olefin polymer which is an olefin polymer containing at least one functional group that has a physical or chemical affinity for nylon, to improve the compa tibility between the crystalline polyolefin polymer and the ny lon.
