# A programmable macrocell using EPROM or EEPROM transistors for architecture control in programmable logic circuits.

## Abstract
A programmable macrocell 28 for use in an integrated circuit device including an electronic circuit 32 responsive to control signals and operative to perform particular opera tions selected by the control signals on input data signals and to develop commensurate output signals, and one or more architecture control circuits 30 each including a programmable EPROM device 34 which when programmed generates a logic signal of a first state and when unprogram med generates a logic signal of a second state, a read and write control circuit 36 responsive to input program data signals and a corresponding address signal and operative to program the EPROM device 34 by applying a programming potential thereto, and a sensing circuit 38 for sensing the programmed or unprogrammed status of the EPROM device 34 and for developing a commensurate control signal for input to the electronic circuit 32.
