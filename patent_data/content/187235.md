# Production of increased ductility in articles consolidated from a rapidly solidified alloy.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a method for consolidat ing rapidly solidified, transition metal alloys which includes the step of compacting a plurality of alloy bodies at a temperature ranging from about 0.90 0.99 Tm melting temperature in C for a time period ranging from about 1 min to 24 hours. The alloy bodies contain at least two transition metal elements and consist essentially of the formula Fe,Co and or Ni A consolidated article produced in accordance with the present invention has increased ductility and toughness with a tensile strength of at least about 1200 MPa and an impact resistance of at least 10 Joules unnotched charpy test . The article is composed of a crystalline, transition metal alloy, which has an average grain size of greater than 3 micrometers and contains separated precipitate particles ranging from about 3 25 micrometers in average size.
