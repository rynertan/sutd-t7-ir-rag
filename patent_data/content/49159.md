# BUS INTERFACE IN COMMUNICATION CONTROLLER

## Abstract
A data processing system includes a CPU2, a main memory 4 subsystem, and a communication subsystem 8 all coupled to a system bus 16 . Subsystems communicate with each other during asynchronously generated informa tion bus transfer cycles. Each one of the subsystems receives information by providing any one of three signal responses including a positive acknowledge immediate response , a negative acknowledge the unit is busy , and a quasi negative response the unit will probably be ready soon . To expedite the response in the case of the transfer over the system bus of an input output order from the central processing subsystem to the communication sub system, the bus interface 30 in the communication system stores a positive acknowledge or a negative acknowledge signal for each communication channel. The signal is set to indicate a negative acknowledge when the previous input output order filled the last communication control block. The signal is set to indicate a positive acknowledge when the previous input output order emptied the communica tion control block.
