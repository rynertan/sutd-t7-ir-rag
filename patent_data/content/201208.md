## Description
Recent developments in recombinant DNA technology allow one to express genes from higher organisms in bacteria and yeast, which can be grown in large scale fermentations. This technology has spawned a number of efforts to develop commercially viable fermentation processes in which these microorganisms produce proteins such as enzymes or hormones, which must otherwise be isolated from animal or human tissue. In many cases much of the cost of such fermentative processes is in the steps required to recover the desired product in an acceptably pure state. Usually, the microorganisms must be disrupted, and their contents solubilized with denaturants before the desired product can be isolated and purified away from other cell components. Each processing step adds to the final cost of the product. One way to avoid such a lengthy purification procedure is to arrange for the microoganism to secrete the desired product directly into its growth medium during fermentation. In this way the product can be obtained immediately, in a relatively pure form, simply by removing the producing cells in a single centrifugation or filtration step. The yeast However, previous attempts to use Recent studies by Rothstein, J. H. and Stevens, T. H. Presentation at the Genetics Society of America Annual Meeting, August 13, 1984 and Emr, S. Presentation at Yeast Expression Vectors Symposium, Banbury Center, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, June 21 24, 1984 have shown that host cell mutations can be isolated that affect the intracellular localization of yeast proteins in the yeast secretion pathway. Both a natural yeast protein carboxy peptidase Y and a fusion of two yeast proteins carboxy peptidase Y and invertase were redirected from the vacuole to the outside of the cell by host cell mutagenesis and selection. However, the utility of using the mutant strains generated by either of these selection methods for the secretory production of foreign proteins has not been demonstrated. Furthermore, in each case a strong selective pressure for the extracellular secretion of a specific protein was applied to the mutagenized cells. This approach differs greatly from a quantitative screening assay for a nonessential gene product and may have introduced strong bias in the distribution of mutants obtained. Also, neither of these studies were directed at increasing the yield of secreted proteins per se, rather they were designed to isolate mutations to aid in the general study of yeast secretion. One group has reported an attempt to isolate mutant strains of yeast that oversecrete the killer toxin which is associated with some yeast strains Bussey, H., Steinmetz O., and Saville, D. 1983 Current Genetics, 7 449 456 . This group isolated two chromosomal mutations in saccharomyces cerevisiae that result in over secretion of the K₁ Killer toxin. The mutations were reported to be a recessive mutation in gene ski 5, which appeared to lead to toxin over secretion through a defect in the cell surface PMSF inhibited protease, and a nuclear gene kre 1 which resulted in a defective 1 6 β D glucan cell wall receptor for killer toxin. It was noted that both mutations also caused over secretion of certain other homologous proteins. It is an object of the present invention to provide mutant yeast cells which have an increased capacity for secreting heterologous polypeptides such as proteins. It is a further object of this present invention to create a method for screening mutant yeast cells to determine those which have an increased capacity for secreting heterologous polypeptides such as proteins. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for the production of a heterologous polypeptide such as protein by means of secretion from a yeast cell transformed with all or part of a recombinant plasmid carrying the gene for a heterologous polypeptide such as a protein. It is an additional object of the present invention to provide mutant strains of It has now been found that mutant strains of yeast can be obtained that have the ability to secrete heterologous polypeptides such as proteins with high efficency. Upon expression of the protein product within the yeast cell, the expressed product is processes, if necessary, and then transported into the medium of the cell culture. According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a method of obtaining a desired polypeptide product as defined in claim 1. Preferred embodiments of this first aspect are described in sub claims 2 10. Further aspects and embodiments of the invention are defined and described in the remaining claims 11 29. Thus, by practicing the present invention, a desired polypeptide product such as a mature protein, can be obtained in high yields from supersecreting yeast cells by collecting the polypeptide products secreted from the yeast cells. The yeast cells should be obtained by selecting a starting transformable yeast strain and causing the yeast strain to undergo mutagenesis and form mutant cells. The mutant cells should be transformed to secrete a heterologous polypeptide. The mutant cells are then screened to determine those final cells which secrete the last mentioned heterologous polypeptide in amounts greater than two times the amounts secreted by the starting strain when so transformed. The final cells which can be cured of the recombinant plasmid prior to culturing, are transformed again with a gene which gives the final desired polypeptide product, or not cured, but simply transformed with the gene for another polypeptide. The mutant cells discussed above can be transformed prior to mutagenesis or after mutagenesis. In a preferred form, the polypeptide is prochymosin because its expression and secretion is capable of being simply and efficiently measured in a screening assay to identify the supersecreting mutants resulting from the mutagenesis. Mutant yeast strains are provided which are supersecreting strains for desired final polypeptide products, in that they have a higher capacity for the secretion of heterologous polypeptides or proteins, than often occurs in yeast strains. Surprisingly, the strains are supersecreting for desired products whether or not the expression levels of the products are generally the same as the original strains from which the supersecreting strains are derived. A screening method is provided which selects a supersecreting yeast strain. The method involves spreading yeast cells on a solid nutrient support plate and allowing growth of individual colonies which have been transformed with the gene for prochymosin. The visible growth is removed from the support and a casein containing solution is applied in a solidifying material as an overlay. The casein containing solution is preferably milk and the solidifying material is preferably agarose. Following incubation, clot formation is noted and the cells producing such clots are recovered for use as supersecreting yeast strains. A screening method in accordance with the invention preferably goes through the transformation, mutagenesis, and selection steps as described above. After selection, the supersecreting strains can be cured and again transformed or, in some cases, the product used which facilitated an efficient screening method is the final desired product, and no further transformation is required. Specific supersecreting strains of It is a feature of this invention that the methods herein described can be simply carried out, using known laboratory equipment, to provide high yield of desired polypeptide, and specific mature protein products, from yeast strains that have ordinarily lower production capacity, because they secrete less than the mutants, even though they may express as much product as the mutants. It is a further feature of this invention that particularly desirable high secreting yeast strains are obtained, and are useful, when properly transformed to produce a multitude of different polypeptide products. Although prochymosin is particulary desirable as a gene product for use in screening to enable supersecreting cells to be identified, in many cases, products other than prochymosin are desired. In such cases, the selected supersecreting strains can be cured as known by selecting from the supersecreting cell population those cells that no longer retain the prochymosin genetic material. The selected, so cured, cells can then be further transformed by known transforming methods as used for the initial transformation including, but not limited to, the lithium chloride method as described by Ito, H., Fukuda, Y., Murata, K. and Kimura, A. 1983 J. Bacteriol. Separation of the final desired product from the media in or on which the finally transformed supersecreting cells grow, can be carried out by known methods. For example, the culture media can be physically separated from the cells in the case of liquids and treated by filtering, column separation or the like depending upon the final product desired. The above and other features of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein As used herein, the following terms have their known meaning in the art defined below Mutant yeast cell as used herein means the yeast cell that is the result of a genetic change. Secretion as used herein means the transport of a polypeptide or protein product through the plasma membrane alone or additionally through the cell wall of the yeast into the surrounding medium. Secretion signal sequence as used herein means a sequence of hydrophobic amino acid residues attached to the amino terminus of a polypeptide which are essential for the precursor polypeptide to be processed, and the mature protein to be translocated in the secretion pathway of the cell. Alternatively, secretion signal sequence may refer to the DNA sequence that encodes this sequence of amino acid residues. This DNA sequence is located between the translation initiation codon ATG and the coding region for the mature form of the polypeptide. Processing as used herein means a the loss or proteolytic cleavage of the signal sequence from the polypeptide or protein so as to produce the polypeptide or protein in mature form and or b the addition of oligosaccharide to the glycosylation recognition sequences which are inherently present or may be provided by added glycosylation sequences in the mature protein. Mature protein as used herein means that form of the protein product which is actually secreted by the cell. Precursor of a polypeptide or protein as used herein means a polypeptide or protein as synthesized within a cell having a signal sequence attached to the mature form of the protein. The attendant processing of the precursor results in its mature polypeptide or protein. Curing refers to a process which eliminates all copies of a plasmid from a yeast strain. Transformable yeast strain means yeast cells into which foreign DNA can be introduced. The level of secretion of a protein is regulated inter alia by its host strain and by the specific DNA sequences expressing that protein. After yeast cells, which normally secrete very low levels of the internally produced protein product, are mutagenized, mutant strains can be selected which have a secretion efficiency which is at least two fold higher than the non mutant strain and such mutant cells are considered to be supersecreting . The use of supersecreting strains for the secretory production of gene products from yeast is advantageous in those cases wherein polypeptides whose precursors contain signal sequences are produced, but sometimes inefficiently secreted, when the genes for these proteins are expressed in yeast. Examples of such proteins include but are not limited to prochymosin, bovine growth hormone BGH , proinsulin, prourokinase PUK , alpha 1 antitrypsin, tissue plasminogen activator TPA , interleukin 2 IL 2 and human growth hormone HGH . Yeast strains prepared by the genetic processes described herein are exemplified by cultures now on deposit with the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Maryland. These cultures are identified by Accession Number 20750, Strain Designation CGY1285, Accession Number 20751, Strain Designation CGY1083, Accession Number 20752, Strain Designation CGY1291, and Accession Number 20753, Strain Designation CGY998 and were deposited by Collaborative Research, Inc. on April 5, 1985. As more fully described below, the strains to be mutagenized in the present invention can be any strain of yeast that can be transformed with DNA and has or can be transformed to have the appropriate genetic markers to enable one to select transformants. For recognition as a supersecreting strain, it contains or can be transformed to contain DNA sequences required for the expression and secretion of the desired gene product. After the yeast strain is mutagenized, a screening method is required so that those strains which are newly found to be supersecreting strains can be isolated away from those strains which are not. Mutagenesis can be carried out as known in the art by treatment with any of a number of known chemical mutagens including ethyl methane sulfonate EMS , and nitroso guanidine. The strain or a mixed group of strains can also be mutagenized by treatment with radiation that damages DNA such as ultraviolet light, x rays or particle radiation. Mutagenesis can also occur by the introduction of new DNA materials. Such DNA materials could include fragments of yeast DNA carried on high copy number plasmid vectors. The variation in these DNA changes could be new combinations of promoter and or secretion signal sequences with a desired gene, or they could be newly created junctions between segments of DNA such as those created by digestion with a given restriction endonuclease followed by limited digestion with an exonuclease and treatment with DNA ligase. Alternatively, these variations could be newly introduced changes in the DNA sequence of the promoter secretion signal sequence gene sequence that have been introduced by any of a variety of Once having used any effective mutagenesis treatment to obtain a collection of different mutant cells, a screening method is carried out to identify and isolate the desired mutant cells. The screening method of the present invention relies upon the presence of both a foreign gene to be expressed and the DNA sequences required for its expression and secretion. The gene product should be a material capable of being assayed. In the present invention, the gene is preferably prochymosin along with DNA sequences that allow for its expression and secretion from yeast. Such DNA sequences include a promoter sequence such as the 5 flanking region from the yeast triose phosphate isomerase gene TPI , or a similar region from another yeast gene such as phosphogycerate kinase PGK , galactokinase GAL1 , alcohol dehydrogenase ADH1 or invertase SUC2 . A secretion signal sequence also known as a pre sequence is also provided which could be the coding region for the amino terminal portion of a secreted yeast gene such as invertase, acid phosphatase or mating factor alpha. Such a secretion signal sequence could also be a similar functioning sequence from a non yeast gene such as the pre sequence of prochymosin, a synthetic pre sequence or a pre sequence created by combining parts of two or more known pre sequences. Following mutagenesis of the prochymosin producing yeast strain, the mutagenized yeast cells are grown on agar plates. The plates can be made with any of a number of media normally used for the culturing of yeast. It is preferable to use a medium such as SD medium as described in Cells are preferably spread on the nutrient agar plates at a density that results in the growth of from 1 to 10 colonies per cm², but greater densities could be used to advantage in certain cases. After inoculation, the plates are incubated at 30 C for from 48 to 96 hours, although temperatures as low as 15 The yeast cells are removed from the agar medium plates by application of sterile discs made of absorbent material such as filter paper to the surface of the agar medium where the cells are growing. The process is repeated until all the visible cells are removed. The first disc from each plate is preferably stored in a sterile petri dish for later recovery of mutant cells. At this point it is desirable to assay the amount of active chymosin present in regions of the nutrient agar plate that formerly lay just under the yeast colonies. In conventional practice, chymosin activity is assayed by introducing a sample of the material to be tested into a specific volume of milk and noting the time required for that milk to coagulate or form a clot. However, in the case of a solid surface on which small areas are to be assayed, it is preferable to apply milk to that surface directly. The volume of milk acted upon by each small region can be effectively limited by mixing the milk with an agent such as molten agarose which will cause it to solidify soon after being applied to the surface. Clotted milk can be visualized as opaque regions in the normally translucent milk agarose mixture. Thus, a milk agarose overlay containing molten agarose, nonfat dry milk, CaC12, NaPO4 and pepstatin is poured onto the surface of each plate and allowed to solidify. Pepstatin, a protease inhibitor, is included in the overlay mixture to enable one to screen for mutants with various background strains and DNA constructions that have a range of secreted activities before mutagenesis. Without pepstatin, intense regions of opacity quickly form over colonies that secrete as little as 0.1 units of clotting activity per gram wet weight of cells. With pepstatin, the chymosin activity is partially inhibited and the opaque regions forming over non mutant colonies are much less intense and take several hours to form, thus allowing mutant colonies to be identified. The amount of pepstatin used which can vary from 0 to 100 mg ml, depends upon the background level of secreted activity to be inhibited and the desired level of secreted activity to be found in the mutants. The concentration of nonfat dry milk can also vary from 2 to 20 w v or more depending upon the intensity of the opaque region desired and the time for such a region to form. Each of the plates containing a milk agarose overlay are preferably incubated at room temperature 25oC but the range of incubation temperature may be as broad as 0oC to 40oC. As soon as the first opaque regions of clotted milk are observed, their positions are noted, as these are likely to correspond to those colonies which have secreted the most chymosin. The incubation step is continued until at least faint clots have formed over the regions of the plate corresponding to most of the colonies. This background of faint clots enables one to orient the filter paper replicates with respect to the nutrient agar plates facilitates the identification of colonies on the filter paper replicates that correspond to clots that formed quickly or that were particularly large or intense. After cells from colonies that correspond to intense or quickly forming clots are streaked out on nutrient agar plates and incubated until individual colonies form, several independent colonies from each putative mutant strain are assayed for secreted chymosin activity. This is done in a number of ways, but it is preferable to use a rapid method that allows one to assay a large number of strains in a reasonably short period of time. One method is to use cells from an isolated colony to inoculate a patch on a nutrient agar plate and incubate that plate until a dense patch of growing yeast is apparent. Cells from this patch are then suspended in buffer and incubated on ice. A sample of this suspension is then added to a specific volume rehydrated nonfat dry milk and incubated with shaking at 30o C, noting the time required for the milk to coagulate. The secreted activity of a strain is calculated by dividing a constant by the product of the time required for coagulation and the number of cells used. This measurement is preferably performed on at least three colonies from each putative mutant strain and the results averaged to get an accurate measurement of the secreted activity of that strain. An arbitrary cutoff is normally defined at an activity level above which a strain can be considered to have a supersecreting phenotype. For purposes of this invention, this cutoff is defined as two times the secreted activity of the unmutagenized backgound strain. After a number of supersecreting strains have been identified it is customary to subject them to a variety of genetic analyses to determine the type of mutation that has occurred. Standard techniques of yeast genetics and the quantitative assay described above can be used to determine if the supersecreting phenotype of a given strain is the result of a single mutation, if that mutation is dominant or recessive, the chromosomal location of different mutations, and whether or not various pairs of recessive mutations will complement each other. It is also possible to mate supersecreting strains to unmutagenized strains and sporulate the resulting diploid strains in order to obtain supersecreting strains that do not contain a number of uncharacterized mutations that may effect cell growth i.e. move the supersecreting mutations into different genetic backgrounds . Further, it is also possible to mate supersecreting strains containing mutations in different complementation groups to each other, and sporulate the resulting diploids in order to isolate multiply mutant strains that contain more than one supersecreting mutation. Often such multiply mutant strains will secrete prochymosin or other heterologous proteins even more efficiently than singly mutant strains. It is also possible to transform super secreting strains with additional recombinant sequences that contain other promoter signal sequence gene combinations, either after the resident plasmid has been removed, or in addition to it. A supersecreting strain isolated by this method can also be used as a starting strain for additional rounds of mutagenesis and screening as described herein. In a first example of this invention yeast strain CGY998, which was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Maryland, on April 5, 1985, and is identified by Assession Number 20753, was used as a starting strain. CGY998 is background strain CGY339 mating type alpha, his4 29, ura3 52, pep4 3 containing the plasmid pCGS514 which is shown in Table 1. This plasmid was derived from the yeast The screening assay used in this example utilizes the facts that prochymosin is expressed and secrected from yeast strain CGY998 at this low level, and that the activity of this prochymosin can be assayed by a applying milk agarose overlay to nutrient agar plates that have been used to grow colonies of such cells. Because this assay is fairly quantitative it is possible to identify cells that are secreting more chymosin activity amongst a backgound of cells that are already secreting some. Cells from strain CGY998 were mutagenized with ethyl methane sulfonate according to the method of Sherman, et al 1981 Mutagenized cells were spread onto 9 cm nutrient agar plates that each contained approximately 25 ml of SD medium as described by Sherman, et al 1981 In this example it is shown that mutant yeast strains selected on the basis of their improved capacity for the secretion of prochymosin have utility in the production of a heterologous protein other than chymosin. Thus they may have general utility in the production of any protein that is to be secreted from yeast. A recombinant DNA plasmid, designated pCGS447, identical to pCGS514 except that pCGS447 contains, in place of the approximately 2100 base pair pTPI SUC2 prochymosin sequence see table 1 , the complete coding sequence for bovine growth hormone BGH along with its amino terminal secretion signal or pre sequence fused to the promoter region of the yeast GAL1 gene as described by Goff, et al 1984 Isolated transformant colonies from each of these four strains were grown in patches on agar plates containing galactose as a carbon and energy source. Growth on galactose is required for expression from the GAL1 promoter on pCGS447. Following a 96 hour incubation period, approximately 100 mg of cells from each transformed strain were scraped off these plates and suspended in 0.5 ml of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0 . After the cells had been removed from this suspension by a brief centrifugation the supernatant portion were frozen and evaporated to dryness The dried pellets were then resuspended 40 microliters of SDS sample buffer as described by Laemmli, U. D. and Favre, M. 1973 J. Mol. Biol. Clearly the ssc1 1 mutation is very effective at improving the secretion efficiency of bovine growth hormone from yeast. The effect of ssc2 1 is less dramatic, but still at least two fold the amount secreted in the absense of an ssc mutation, and the effect of both mutations in the same strain is approximately the sum of the effect of the two mutations individually. This example using prourokinase is a further demonstration that mutant yeast strains selected on the basis of their improved capacity for the secretion of prochymosin may have general utility in the production of any protein that is to be secreted from yeast. Recombinant DNA plasmid pCGS696 is identical to pCGS514 except that pCGS696 contains, in place of the approximately 1300 base pair SUC2 prochymosin sequence see table 1 , the complete coding sequence for preprourokinase prePUK UK Patent Application 2121050 Preparation of Functional Human Urokinase Proteins Heyneker, H. L., Holmes, W. E. and Vehar, G. A., also EP A 92182 along with its amino terminal secretion signal or pre sequence as well as a 900 base pair DNA fragment from the yeast SUC2 gene including the transcription terminator region Goff et al 1984 supra . Plasmid pCGS696 was used to transform four strains of yeast to uracil prototrophy by the LiCl method of Ito, et al, Isolated transformant colonies from each of these four strains were grown in patches on agar plates containing SD medium plus leucine and histidine. Following a 72 hour incubation period, approximately 200 to 400 mg of cells from each transformed strain were scraped off these plates and suspended in 0.5 ml 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0 , 100 mM sodium chloride. Approximately 25 ul of each cell suspension was added to a well of a bovine plasminogen rich, fibrin agarose plate Brakman, P. 1967 Fibrinolysis, Scheltema and Holkema, Amsterdam, 1 124 . The number of fibrinolytic units of prourokinase PUK in each sample was estimated by comparison of the fibrinolytic zone produced with that produced by purified standards on the same fibrin plate. The amount of PUK secreted per gram of cells was calculated by dividing by the wet weight of the cells that had originally been present in each suspension. Results are presented in the following table Clearly the ssc1 1 and ssc2 1 mutations are very effective at improving the secretion efficiency of PUK from yeast. The effect of both mutations in the same strain is greater than the effect of the two mutations individually. While the specific embodiments of the invention have been shown and described, various modifications are possible. The present application gives specific examples of the production and secretion of prochymosin, bovine growth hormone and prourokinase from supersecreting mutants. However, other polypeptide gene products from mammalian or other sources such as human growth hormone HGH , proinsulin, tissue plasminogen activator TPA , alpha 1 antitrypsin and interleukin 2 can be obtained and secreted from the described supersecreting mutants.
