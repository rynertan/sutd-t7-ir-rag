# Method of mass analyzing a sample by use of a quadrupole ion trap.

## Abstract
In a quadrupole ion store or ion trap type mass spectrometer, significantly improved mass selection is achieved by scanning the applied RF and DC voltages or the frequency ω sequentially to render unstable trapped ions. These are passed out through apertures in an end cap to a high gain electron multiplier to provide a signal indicative of the ion mass. Sensitivity and mass resolution is also enhanced by operating the ion tape at a relatively high pressure in the range 1 X 10 ¹ to 1 X 10 ⁵ torr. The presence of collision gas molecules, such as helium, improves sensitivity and mass resolution. In addition, the structure itself is built of stacked units, sealed by O rings, which are easily disassem bled for cleaning.
