# Charging discharging circuit.

## Abstract
A charging discharging circuit is formed of transistors Q1, Q2 resisotrs R1 R4 and a capacitor C. The series resistors R1, R2 are connected between the power supply line Vcc and the circuit ground. The series resistors R3, R4 are connected between the line Vcc and the circuit ground. The collector of NPN transistor Q1 is connected to Vcc, the base thereof is connected to the junction between R3 and R4, and the emitter thereof is coupled to the junction between R1 and R2. The collector of PNP transistor Q1 is connected to the circuit ground, the base thereof is connect ed to the junction between R3 and R4, and the emitter thereof is coupled to the junction between R1 and R2. Capa citor C is connected in parallel to R2. The charged voltage of C is used as a reference potential VR for another linear circuit. Suppose that R1 R2, R3 R4 and Vcc 10V. When Vcc rises from 0V to 10V but VR does not reach to 5V, Q1 is forwardly biased so that C is quickly charged by the emitter current of Q1. When Vcc falls from 10V to 0V but VR does not reach to 0V, Q2 ist forwardly biased so that C is quickly discharged by the emitter current of Q2. When VR 5V stationary state , Q1 and Q2 are both cut off, so that only small currents flow through the series circuits of R1, R2 and R3, R4. The time constant of R1 R2 . C can be made large so that VR is free from ripples of Vcc.
