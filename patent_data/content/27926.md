# Degradation resistant polyolefin articles and process for making same.

## Abstract
Degradation resistant polyolefin articles, such as fibers, films, sheets and the like, are prepared from poly meric compositions containing a stabilizing system com prising a hindered amine and a metal phosphonate which have been overcoated with a finish comprising an eth oxylated lubricant and a phosphate ester. In a preferred embodiment, polypropylene textile materials having im proved thermal stability are provided compositions con taining a stabilizing system comprising a hindered amine and a nickel phosphonate which have been overcoated with a finish composition comprising an ethoxylated lubricant and a phosphate ester in an amount sufficient to impart antistatic properties to said composition and in crease the thermal stability of said polypropylene textile materials.
