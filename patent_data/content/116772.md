# Connector for a filter bank supporting latticework and method of assembling same.

## Abstract
A filter bank supporting latticework comprises a plurality of connectors 10,28,29 each of which has two, three or four extensions 12 radiating from a common central location. Each of the extensions 12 has a U shaped cross sectional configuration so as to define a bottom wall and two opposite side walls. A threaded coupling member 18 is disposed at the central location of each four extension connectors 10 for securing the connector to a supporting tie rod 19 , and a protruberance 20 is disposed within each U shaped exten sion at a predetermined distance from the central location. Adjacent connectors are adapted to be joined by an intercon necting channel 31,32 of predetermined length, with the ends of the channel being positioned within aligned exten sions 12 of adjacent connectors, and with the ends of the channels 31,32 abutting the respective protruberances 20 . A supporting latticework is thereby constructed which defines a plurality of rectangular open areas, and the length and width dimensions of each open area is automatically established. Each extension 12 of each connector further includes a transverse groove 22 extending about the inside surface thereof, and an aperture 24 extending through one of the walls and communicating with the groove. A caulking material may be forced through the aperture 24 after the interconnecting channel 31.32 is secured in the extension 12 , and so that the caulking material is able to flow along the groove and form a seal between the extension and channel.
