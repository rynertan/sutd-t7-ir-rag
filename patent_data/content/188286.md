# Image transmission system.

## Abstract
Plural television cameras 16A 16B of monitored sites, each having a particular code, output image signals of the sites. An image signal transmitting unit 50 receives those signals and produces an image transmission signal sent to a monitoring side. The transmission signal is so formed that one channel of the transmission line which is divided into plural channels is assigned to the transmission of the image signal of each important site to reproduce the full motion image of the site in the monitoring side and all the signals of other sites are transmitted on the time sharing basis through the remaining channels to reproduce the frame repetition images. The assignment of the channels is determined by the order of the codes included in an instruction signal from an instruction signal transmitting unit 20 in the monitoring side. An operator can select the order of the codes.
