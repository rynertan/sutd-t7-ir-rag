## Description
AUTOMATIC EOUIPMENT FOR BLOOD TRANSFUSION AND FLUID THERAPY The present invention concerns some improvements applied to electronic equipments designed in particular for carrying out in a totally automatic way ex blood transfusions. Due to its ver satility the equipment can be used also in fluido therapy with an obvious advantage against theequipments now in existence. The equipment covered by the invention improves considerably the apparatuses or systems presently in use for ex blood transfusions, which are either t tally manual or only helf automatic with the following drawbacks a They require for their functioning and for facing the possible complications arising possibly in the patient during the ex blood transfusion, a team of professionally specialized persons like a pediatrist or a hematologist, a M.D. or an ATS for the control of constant vital values end the administration of adequate remedies, as all as an assistant rcsr writing down the partial quantities transfused. b It often happens that the frecuency of infusion ex traction is not regular as far as each phase velocity is concerned there further exists the possibility of confusions due to the alteration of a single phase, with consequent risks for ,the patient. c The usual one way use for the entry and the exit of the blood cause ups and downs in the blood pressure in the veins , which is unfavourable to the patient and doubles the time necessary for the operation of the blood change. d There exists a potential risk of embolism due to the entry of air bubbles which have not been detected by the operator. e It may happen that the alteration of constant vital values is not detected , which is of special importance during the ex blood transfusion, due to the the fact that usual appara tuses do not avail themselves of the adequate control devices of to the untimely detection at given intervals through ancillary devices in this case the latter represent a set of equipments which cause an overload and hindrance in the operation area. f A further hindrance is represented by the set of cables, droppers, ancillary apparatuses etc. which are the necessary support for blood and serum units to be used. g The exposure of the units proceeding from the HDod Bank to heat sources without an adeo uate regulation, can be harmful and cause an erytrocytarian lysis or a hypothermy in th patient due to an insufficient heating of the blood to be transfused. Then suitable self ccntrolled equipments are used for blood heating purposes, they are generally bulky and require more cables and intermediate elements to be added in the already complicated operating area. As against such drawbacks, the quipment covered by the invention involves the following advantages a It permits to change quite exactly the total volume of blood prescribed by the Doctor carrying out the ex blood trans fusion, informing him through an acoustical and luminous signal and stopping the change procedure once the pre selected volume has been obtained. b It allows the selection of two distinct change systems System A. When only one way is used in the patient, e.g. the umbilical vein, the infusion extraction is alternative and realized through two infusion pumps which are independent between them. Although this system or procedure is similar to that presently in use, it involves a series of important advantages, which are as follows 1 The infusion extraction volumes are always exactly the same. 2 The cadence of the infusion extracAion is uniform and always the same. 3 There exists no possibility of errors due to the alteration of the infusion or extraction sequence. 4 The partial voles to be changed and previously selected by the Doctor, appear at any moment on the digital display of the apparatus. System B. When it is possible to dispose of two ways, an inlet and an outlet one, the advantages are even greater due to the following . 1 Alternating oscillationsare avoided on the vascular wall and in the venous pressure represented by the alternating changes of the partial volumes in the infusion extraction phases. 2 The synchronizing of the infusion extraction is obtained completely thanks to the use of a single motor, which actuates at the same time two infusion pumps which are synchronized. 3 In this system and for the same total volume of blood the time required by the ex blood transfusion is reduced to a half. c It avails itself of a blood heating system which is self regulated and built in into the equipment, which introduces the blood into the patient at 370C, any possible modification of this temperature being signalled through an acoustic cum luminous contrivance, which interrupts immediately the influsion. d The presence of air bubbles is detected inside the infusion droppers and actuates an acoustic cum luminous alarm system, which interrupts the functioning of the apparatus, thus avoiding the risks of an embelism of gaseous kind in the patient. e Supposing now that curb the ex blood transfusion and before reaching the total volume of change planned, the contents of the transfusion unit are exhausted, the device is immediately stopped and an acoustical cum luminous signal appears informing the operator of the situation arising therefreom. Ãœnce the next transfusion unit has teen put in operation, the apparatus will continue in its functioning without alterating the programme arranged previeusly. f It is possible to stop the apparatus at a given moment and for the time desired, then going on with the same programme or with another different programme, if this is considered necessary the figures appearing previously on the digital display may be maintained or it can be set to zero and a new operation started. g In case of alterations in the constant vital values which appear essential to the operator s control, the device stops the running of the contrivance and informs the operator through an acoustic cum luminous s gnal, showing instantly what kind of vital value appears altered at the moment. The apparatus will be restarted only after the correction of the alteration or if the Doctor considers that, inspite of all, it is necessary to go on with the ex blood transfusion. h All the elements in direct contact with the blood represent 2 cosed system and can be totally dissociated, in order to Evoid contaminations and serum hepatitis.. i A gutter end is built in which is dissassembeble end is thus eliminating an ancillary unit representing a further hindrance in iiie operation field of the operator. j Thinks to the autocratic functioning, a a single operator ns sa iicient for an efficient carrying out of the ex blood br nsfusion, chacking at the same tine any pessible complication which could arise and administering any necessary remedy. As far as utilization of the equipment outside the proper field of the ex blood transfusion, it can be useful,due to its versatility,in all those cases in which the introduction of fluids or medicines by intravenous systems, with a constant flow, duly regulated and with fixed volumes. As instance of some applications we could mention here the parenteral alimentation, the transfusions of blood and derivatives thereof, the antibiotherapy, the anticoagulation with continuous infusion, the rehydration etc. Among the numerous advantages of the equipment, we could Invention here in general way Control and protection of gaseous embolism. Selection of the total volume to be transfused. Controlled infusion cadence. Possibility of transfusing at 370C, as in the case of cryoagglutinins , rasps transfusions etc.creating conditions that be be vital for the patient. Automatic stop once the desired volume has been trasnfused. Possibility of changing the cadence of infusion when the conditions of the patient eke it advisable case of lavish hemorrhage, shock etc. rossibility of administration to the same patient of two different soluticns through the same or 2 distinct venous njection. Possibility of contemporary transfusion to two patients taking advantage of the double infusion pump, of the same energy and space. The operation of the equipment is as follows The quipment can be connected with the alternate current system or function independently thanks to a storage battery built in for emergency cases. Once equipment has been connected with either of the above sources of energy, a warning light is lighted showing that the contrivance is ready for operation . The total volume is planned through a selection device. In case of a single way used for inlet and outlet operations i.e. for introducing into and extracting from the patient the necessary blood quantities system A the partial volumes for the change are to be selected in advance, in an alternating way through the selector of partial volumes. In case of disposing of indepencant ways for the entry and the exit of the patient s blood system B , the selection device for partial volumes is to be zero set. Only in this case the motor will start and actuate the to per istaltic pumps with synchronized moveents, one of them effecting the infusion and the other one the extraction. On the total and partial volutes have been selected the control device will be energized and set in motion the equipment. The partial volumes will appear on the digital display of the apparatus . If during the functioning of the equipment a stop will appear necessary,e.g. for administering calcium to the patient, the appropriate control will be energized and the apparatus will stop immediately whilst the display will show the former figures. In order to set in motion again the equipment, the appropriate control device will be energized again and the apparatus will restart from the point of stop in the same rotation direct on. If we were interested in a change of the previous programme the following operations should be carried out 1 ctuation of the stopping control. 2 Actuation of the zero setting control. 3 Selection of a new programme on the total and partial selectors. 4 Actuation of the or ration prosecution control. Once the total change volume has been reached, after its pre selection, the equipment should stop automatically and the acoustic cum luminous signal should warn the operator. If during the operation of the equipment connected to the possible vital constant values controls, an alteration should appear on one of these, the equipment could stop immediately and automaticelly and the panel would show the altered value for wrat it is The alarm would sojnd at the same time. The disconnection of the alarm would occur through a button disconnecting the sound horn but leaving the light werning signal till the drawback is eliminated. The equipment uses for its functions an appropriate material plastical, sterile, apyrogen and of single use which in the case of ex blood transfusion would be composed as follows A blood unit to be transfused, clean, connected to a standard dropper with blood transfusion strainer, connected in turn with a plastic material bag with canaliculi forming a serpentine, put in the inside of the heating unit.The serpentine and the reduced thickness of the walls of the bag aim at lengthening the contact time for a uniform heating level of the blood to be transfused, this bag cum serpentine being in connection with a tube similar to the standard dropper, which in its medium section contains a tubular segment duly inserted into it, rade of flexible rubber and having 2 diameter which is appropriate for the quantity of flow per minute which is to be transfused. This rubber section is coupled with the rolls of the peristaltic pump, whilst the other end of the tube is connected with a catheter of the intravascular type, introduced into the patient s body. hen the administration ways and the extraction ones are distinct , a second intravascular catheter placed in another point of the body is conrjpcted kith a tube which is exactly equal to the one previously oescr ,ed hereinbefore but placed between the rolls of the peristaltic pump so that the flow proceeding from it flows in a contrary direction. whilst the other end of this tube is introduced into a drain container. ehen a single way system is employed for infusion and extraction system A , the aformentioned tubes are replaced by a single tube. One of the ends is connected with the bag cum serpentine and this branch, with its rubber segment, is assembled on the peristaltic pump, the second branch of the Y being mounted on the other peristaltic pump and its end connected with the drain container . Finally the third branch of the Y is connected directly with the intravascular catheter of the patient. When the use is different from that of the ex blood transfusion, one excludes some elements of the disassemblable assembly e.g. the Y system The serpentine of the heater is disconnected when temperature control is of no interest. Also the intravascular catheters can be excluded for inlet and outlet functions and replaced by an other element of venous injection. For the operation of the equipment one employs ancillary elements which cannot be disassembled and are integral with the equipment, like e.g. A bubble detector consisting in a photoelectric cell, leaning through a tong system on the standerd dropper with strainer. A heating unit With self regulation at 37C C which is forming a compact assembly with the housing of the equi ment and contains inside the serpentine bag. The blood element or other elenent to be transfused and the standard cropper with strainer are supported by a foot leaning en the side of the equipment and being easily disassemblable for transport or when equipment is idle. It is to be emphasized that the equipment contains a processing unit controlling the movements and stoppings appearing on an optical acoustical signal in case of some irregularities in the functioning. The same unit will show us on the display panel all the necessary data on the functioning of the equipment. In order to better understand the invention, we refer hereinafter a practical example of its realization, it being purely referred as instance and not as limitative description of the invention itself, with reference to the enclosed drawings on which we have Figure 1, showing a schematic view of the functioning of the two way equipment Figure 2, showing 2 schematic view of the single way equipment. Figure 3 showing a schematic view with some details of the arrangement and functioning of some of the components used by the equipment covered by the invention. Figures 1 and 2 show an equipment 1 comprizing a pro cessinb unit 2 controlling the REM and the speed of a moor 3 through elements 4 and 5. Motor 3 actuates sivult neously an impulsion pump 6 and a suction pump 7. The e aip ent erploye some tubes 8 which convey blood from the storage conteiner 9 to the patient s body or from the latter to the store 10. Figure 3 shows 2 storage container 9 from which blood is conveyed through th strainer 11 and c bubble detector 12 so that along its advancing towards the relevant pump for blood impulsion,blood crosses a bag with canalicula 13 which are placed inside the heating unit 14. Figures 2 and 3 show the alternating functioning of a one way equipment, in which only one pipe or tube 15 Y shaped is used, one of the ends of which 16 is connected with a bag comprizing canalicula , this branch being assembled with its dropper segment on the impulsion pump, whilst the other branch 17 of the Y is assembled on the other pump and its end is connected with the dirty blood container. The third branch 18 is connected with the intravascular catheter of the patient. All the operations regarding the functioning of the equipment appear on the display 19 of the processing unit 2, which is regulating the functioning of the equipment. Having described sufficiently the nature of the invention and the way of practically applying it, we observe that the previously described arrangetnents can be modified in details rrtvided this is not altering the basic principles of the invention itself.
