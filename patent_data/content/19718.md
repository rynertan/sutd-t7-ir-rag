# POSITION CONTROL SYSTEM FOR A MOVING WEB

## Abstract
This disclosure relates to apparatus for controlling the positions of indicia on a moving web relative to the positions of a series of moving articles. The web has a series of spaced indicia on it, and the position of each indicium is matched or registered with the position of an article. First means is provided for sensing each indicium and generating a first signal indicative of the indicia, and second means is provided for sensing the articles and providing a second signal representative of each article. Third means is provided for generating a series of pulses in response to operation of a drive for the web. Counter means counts any pulses between occurrences of the first and second signals, such a count indicating a separation or disparity between positions of an indicium and an associated article. Speed control means operates in response to any such count to adjust the relative speeds of the articles and the web to obtain proper registration.
