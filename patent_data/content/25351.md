## Description
Detection of Bacteria in Urine This invention relates to the detection of bacteria in urine. The qualitative and quantitative examination of urine is frequently an important requirement both in human and veterinery medicine. Urine of human beings and other mammals contains a number of substances in solution some of which are the end products of animal metabolism whilst others are related to the condition of a patient and may arise, for example, from the patient being in a reproductive cycle presence of compounds of the cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene series, e.g., pregnandione , from the partial or total failure of an organ, such as the pancreas, increased glucose content or from the presence of invading bodies viz. bacteria which are eliminated from the patient in the urine. Inorganic salts such as the alkali metal chlorides are another important constituent of urine.It is important to be able readily to determine the presence of bacteria in urine in the presence of these other substances. It is known that certain enzymes will, in the presence of adenosine triphosphate ATP , magnesium ions and oxygen, emit light within the visible spectrum for a short period of time of the order of 120 seconds. The emission of light is accompanied by decarboxylation of the enzyme and liberation of carbon dioxide. This reaction can be used to demonstrate the presence of adenosine triphosphate in an aqueous solution. However information does not appear to be available on the effect of other substances present in urine, whether present singly or in admixture, upon the course of the reaction. A typical enzyme mixture which is readily available and which undergoes the reaction first discussed is the mixture known as luciferin luciferase, obtainable from the mascerated bodies of fire flies.This reacts with ATP in accordance with the following scheme.EMI2.1 tb SEP Mug tb luciferin luciferase SEP SEP ATP SEP luciferin luciferase SEP SEP ATP tb SEP 02 tb Decarboxyluciferin SEP SEP iferase SEP SEP AMP SEP SEP CO2 SEP SEP visible SEP light tb SEP AMP SEP SEP Adenosine SEP monophosphate . tb Provided that the various substances present in urine do not prevent the leaching out of ATP through the cell walls of somatic and bacterial cells and further providing that the presence of these same substances does not prevent the reaction between the light producing enzyme and ATP it should be possible to make use of these phenomena to indicate the presence of bacteria in urine and also, if required, to estimate the amount thereof. It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a method for the detection of bacteria in urine in which use is made of the ability of certain enzymes to emit light in the presence of ATP. The present invention provides a method for the detection of bacteria in urine which comprises a adding to a discrete quantity of urine which is to be tested an enzyme which leaches ATP from somatic cells but not from bacterial cells present therein b then adding a soluble magnesium salt and an enzyme which reacts with ATP with emission of light and recording the light emitted from the resulting solution c after said emission of light has ceased adding to the solution an enzyme which leaches ATP from any bacterial cells present therein and allowing said solution to stand whilst leaching takes place d adding to the resulting solution a soluble magnesium salt and an enzyme which reacts withATP with emission of light and recording the light emitted from the resulting solution and e utilising the data obtained on the emission of light in steps b and d to provide an indication of any bacteria present in the sample of urine under test. In the method of the present invention it is necessary to take into account that the normal functioning of the animal body can result in the presence in urine of some ATP. Usually the concentrations are small but they must be taken into account otherwise an incorrect result will be obtained.Moreover somatic cells are normally present in urine and these can undergo lysis with leaching of ATP through the walls. These potential sources of light must be eliminated before the presence or absence of bacterial cells can be determined. Accordingly in the method of the present invention an enzyme is first added which will effect lysis of somatic cells with leaching of ATP without effecting lysis of any bacterial cells which may be present e.g. an NRS cell lysing agent.The non bacterial cells are mainly serum cells and sperm cells. The light emitted from the ATP leached from these somatic cells can be readily determined. After light arising from the leaching of somatic cells has ceased to be emitted the test sample has added thereto another enzyme which will effect lysis of any bacterial cells with leaching of ATP through the walls e.g. an NRB cell lysing agent. The system is then allowed to stand for a suitable period for lysis to occur with leaching of AT e.g. 10 minutes and it then has added thereto an enzyme which reacts with the ATP present with emission of light and the light emitted as a result of this second lysis is then determined.It is this emission of light which essentially provides an indication of the bacteria present in the sample of urine under test. When the amount of light is carefully measured it can provide a quantitative indication of the bacteria present. The same enzyme which reacts with ATP with emission of light is conveniently used in both light emission steps. The enzyme luciferin luciferase already referred to is conveniently used for this purpose but the use of other equivalent enzymes is within the scope of the . invention. The enzyme luciferin luciferase is normally made available with the requisite quantity of watersoluble magnesium salt in the alternative the necessary quantity of salt solution should be added to the sample under test. No external supply of oxygen is necessary there is sufficient available in the materials used for the present purpose. The light emitted in conducting the tests is conveniently measured by means of a photoelectric cell having a sufficiently high degree of sensitivity. Since it is envisaged that all tests will be carried out under standardised conditions it is contemplated that a number of specimens of urine can be tested simultaneously using a row of similarly mounted and equally sensitive photoelectric cells or equivalent devices each connected to an appropriate recording oircuit. Such photoelectric cells are conveniently disposed beneath and equidistant from a plurality of transparent tubes within which the samples to be tested are placed. When placed within a suitably darkened environment both the strength and duration of the light emitted can be recorded in each case, care being taken to ensure thatlight from only one sample under test is incident upon each photoelectric cell, Each recording circuit may include a read out print device. As an alternative to the use of a plurality of photoelectric cells a photoelectric detector may be employed which sequentially scans the bottom or a side of each of a series of transparent tubes. When it is desired to compare the values for the light emitted in steps b and d of the method the signal derived from the emitted light recorded may be fed to a device which will print out or display the data recorded. The data obtained in step b may be stored in the device and then printed out or displayed in juxtaposition with that obtained in step d . Such a device may comprise a microprocessor. The use of such devices enables rapid ascertainment as to which of a plurality of samples contain bacteria. In carrying out the method of the invention a number of similar vessels each containing a sample of urine which it is desired to test for the presence of bacteria are placed side by side in a rack aid the rack is mounted adjoining a tray having a number of transparent wells. By means of a corresponding number of sterile loops equal quantities of urine, one from each sample, are introduced into corresponding wells in the tray. A predetermined quantity of NRS cell lysing agent is next introduced into each well containing urine. This lysing agent lyses somatic cells but not bacterial cells.The thus inseminated. wells are then allowed to stand for 15 to 30 seconds in order to leach ATP from the somatic cells The tray containing the wells is then transferred to a machine which is provided with means for introducing equal quantities of the light emitting enzyme luciferinluciferase into each well containing a lysed sample of urine. Underlying each well in this machine is a sensitive photoelectric device adapted to receive light from one of the wells. At least this part of the machine should be provided with a darkened environment so that the only light incident upon each of the cells is that emanating from one of the wells containing lysed urine. The electric response from each photoelectric device is separately fed to, a device which prints out or displays an indication proportional to the light incident thereon or stores it.When the, light output has been recorded the tray is removed from the machine. The next step is to add an equal quantity ofNRB cell lysing agent to each of the wells containing already treated urine. The tray containing the wells is then allowed to stand for 5 to 10 minutes after which it is returned to the machine from which it was previously taken and a second equal quantity of the light emitting enzyme luciferin luciferase is introduced into each well containing a lysed sample df urine. The NRB cell lysing agent leaches ATP through the bacterial cell walls in each sample and when these are present ATP is liberated and is available in the solution for reaction with the light emitting enzyme. Any light emitted is then determined and recorded in the same way as after lysing the somatic cells. With respect to the volumes of urine and reagents used in the above procedure these can be very small. Thus 25 or 50 microlitres of urine may be used for each test and equal volumes of NRS and NRB cell lysing agents added thereto in the appropriate steps. The data obtained and recorded in this way provide indications of both the amounts of somatic and bacterial cells present in the urine to be determined. Moreover if any substance is present which influences the reaction with the light emitting enzyme both readings for any given sample will be influenced in the same way and comparison of the readings will still enable a valid conclusion to be drawn. When this procedure is adopted only those samples which reveal abnormalities in the somatic and or bacterial cells present therein require further testing by conventional methods. In general this means that less than onefifth, and often not more than one tenth, of the samples will require to be submitted to the conventional testing methods with a corresponding saving in expense.
