## Description
This invention relates to an optical memory device which conducts at least one of the recording operation, the regenerating operation, or the erasing operation of information by means of light. Optical memory devices have come to public notice as a dense and mass memory device. They can be classified into three groups of regenerative memory devices, additional recording permit memory devices and rewrite permit memory devices. Optical memory devices, which can be classified into additional recording permit memory devices and rewrite permit memory devices, generally have guide tracks to guide a light beam for recording and or regenerating information to a given portion of the optical memory devices. A portion of each of the guide tracks can be formed into a pit shape, resulting in a track address. For example, the optical memory disk shown in Figure Figures Figure The conventional shape of the guide tracks On the other hand, the shape of the track addresses 3 shown in Figure 2 is determined taking into consideration both the ease or difficulty of the formation thereof and the quantity or quality of address signal, and thus the depth d thereof is not necessarily required to be λ 4n. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided an optical memory device comprising a substrate, guide tracks formed on said substrate and pit shaped track addresses extending in line with respective ones of the guide tracks, wherein the pit shaped track addresses are formed outside the guide tracks and the depth d of the guide tracks from the surface of the substrate is equal to the depth d of the pit shaped track addresses from the surface of the substrate, characterised in that the optical memory device is a magneto optical rewrite permit memory device and said depth is in the range from λ 24n to λ 12n, wherein λ is the wavelength of laser light used for the optical memory device and n is the refraction index of the guide track portions and of the track address portions on the substrate. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided an optical memory device comprising a substrate, guide tracks formed on said substrate and pit shaped track addresses extending in line with respective ones of the guide tracks, wherein the pit shaped track addresses are formed outside the guide tracks, characterised in that the optical memory device is a magneto optical rewrite permit memory device and the depth d of the guide tracks from the surface of the substrate is in the range from λ 24n to λ 12n and the depth d of the pit shaped track addresses from the surface of the substrate is in the range from λ 8n to λ 4n, wherein λ is the wavelength of laser light used for the optical memory device and n is the refraction index of the guide track portions and of the track address portions on the substrate. The width The width Embodiments of the present invention may have the advantages of 1 providing an optical memory device wherein the shape of the guide tracks of the substrate is improved, resulting in an excellent quality recording and or regeneration signal 2 providing an optical memory device wherein the shape of the pit shaped track addresses is improved, resulting in an excellent quality track address signal and 3 providing an optical memory device which can be readily manufactured. Embodiments of the invention may be better understood and its numerous advantages will become apparent to those skilled in the art by reference to the accompanying drawings as follows Figure Tracking servo signal and track address signal, which serve as an indication as to whether or not a given portion of the recording medium layer When the intensity distribution of an incident light in the aperture of the objective lens Figure The difference between the left and the right of such as asymmetrical light intensity as shown in Figure The tracking servo signal is zero for such a symmetrical light intensity as shown in Figure The reflected light from the channel shown in Figure As seen from the above description of the tracking servo signal and the track address signal, the recording and regeneration of information can be carried out by detecting optical variation in the recording medium layer within the guide tracks as a variation in the intensity of the reflected light therefrom. The diffraction of the reflected light varies with a variation in the shape of the tracks, causing a variation in the quantity of the reflected light entering the detector which results in the aforementioned noise. The relationship between the quantity of the signal and the shape of the guide tracks is described below When a laser light spot having a radius of r₀ reaches a flat face given that the intensity distribution When a laser light spot having a radius of r₀ reaches a channel such as the guide track portion and the pit shaped track address portion, as shown in Figure wherein In the above mentioned equation, Figure Figure Since the quantity of information signal in the tracks increases with an increase in the quantity of light, the quantity of signal increases with a greater width The quantity As seen from the foregoing description the quantity As shown in Figure Thus, the sensitivity Figure Figure Thus, it is advantageous for the tracking servo signal that the width As mentioned above, the actual guide tracks are not formed with a structure having geometrically straight lines and or curves, but microscopically have a varied and ununiform structure. When the guide tracks are scanned with a light spot, the varied shape thereof causes a variation in diffraction, resulting in a variation in the quantity of the reflected light in the aperture of the objective lens. Given that a variation in the edge portion of the tracks is the variation Δh in the track width, the variation ΔD in the quantity of light therein can be represented by the following equation Since D 1 1 I₀ Figure Figure The above mentioned discussion makes clear the relationship of the quantity of signal and noise with the shape of the tracks. The main object of this invention is to increase the quantity of information signal The optimum shape of the tracks in each specific optical memory device can be determined as follows, depending upon the reflectivity of the recording medium layer and the formation necessity of the pit shaped track address portion The shape of the tracks in this invention is not limited to the edges which rise steeply as shown in Figures
