# Method of producing a precursor pitch for carbon fiber.

## Abstract
A method of producing a precursor pitch for use in the production of carbon fibers is disclosed, which comprises hydrogenating a soft or middle tar pitch to obtain a hy drogenated pitch containing no free carbon and high molec ular weight components and then subjecting it to a heat treatment. In this method, the hydrogenation is carried out in the presence of tetralin at a temperature of 400 450 C, and the heat treatment after the removal of solvent insoluble components and solvent is carried out in an inert gas atmo sphere at a temperature of 450 500 C under a reduced of 0.1 10 Torr.
