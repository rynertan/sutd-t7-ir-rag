## Description
METHOD OF OBTAINING A LYOPllILIZED PRODUCT This invention relates to a process for obtaining a package containing at least one mass of dry matter comprising at least two materials incompatible with each other in the presence of moisture. More specifically, this invention relates to a process of obtaining a multi component, lyophilized immunological reagent. A problem exists in producing a dry mixture of two or more materials which are incompatible or react with each other in the presence of moisture.Exposure to conditions which allow the two materials to react must be minimized. Various methods have been employed in the past to obtain a product containing at least two materials incompatible with each other in the presence of moisture. In U.S. Patent 3,269,905, granted on August 30, 1966 to C.IV. Damaskus, a method is described in which reagents that are incompatible with each other in the presence of moisture are subjected to freezing in successive layers in a container and thereafter the frozen strata is freeze dried. In U.S. Patent 3,616,543, granted November 2, 1971 to E.S. Barclay, a method is described in which reagents that are incompatible with each other in the presence of moisture are sequentially charged in liquid form into a container with freezing of the charge and rotation of the container between charges so that the separate charges to not touch, and then lyophilizing the frozen charges. In U.S. Patent 3,862,302, granted January 21, 1975 to R.T. Price et al., a method is described in which reagents in solution are separately formed into frozen beads or spheres and then placed into a container for lyophilization. A simple, quick process now has been found for producing a dry mixture of two or more such incompatible materials. According to this invention, a process for obtaining a package containing at least one mass of dry matter comprising at least two immmo logical reagent materials incompatible with each other in the presence of moisture is realized by a preparing separately an aqueous liquid composition of each of the materials b charging the liquid compositions into a container maintained at a temperature substantially below the freezing temperature of each of the separate liquid compositions or of a mixture of the liquid compositions so that freezing of the charge or charges of the liquid compositions ensues on the inner surface of the container and c lyophilizing the frozen mass or masses characterised in that the separate liquid compositions are simultaneously charged into the container or a mixture of the liquid compositions is prepared by cooling each of the separate liquid compositions to a temperature slightly above their freezing point and mixing the cooled liquid compositions to obtain a mixture for charging. The liquid compositions are charged in such predetermined amounts that the freezing of the charge or charges immediately occurs on the inner surface of the container. Preferably the container is an upright container. In one embodiment of the invention, the separate liquid colepositions are simultaneously charged directly into the bottom of an upright containerIn a preferred embodiment which provides a more cautionary approach, the liquid compositions are simultaneously charged onto the opposite side walls oi the container. This latter approach is preferred when the quantities of the liquid compositions are such that they do not instantaneously freeze upon contact with the cooled container. When the charged quantities are such that they do not instantaneously freeze and the materials are especially incompatible very reactive then the liquid compositions are charged onto tne upper portions of the opposite side walls of the container.In an especially preferred embodi n,ent the separate liquid compositions are precooled to a temperature slightly above their freezing point and then simultaneously charged into the container.The use of precooled liquid compositions is especially useful wherein the upright container comprises a receptacle with a small surface area or one which is shallow. An example of such a receptacle is found in a Microtiter plate manufactured by Cooke Laboratory Products of Alexandria, Virginia. This plate contains a multiplicity 96 of shallow vee shaped wells or u shaped cupules, each well having a capacity of about 0.25 ml to 0.30 ml. In a second embodiment of the invention each of the two liquid compositions is cooled separately to 1 to 5 C above its freezing point. The cooled liquid compositions are mixed and at a temperature of 1 to 50 C above the freezing point of the mixture, the mixture is charged directly into the bottom of an upright container which is maintained at a temperature substantially below e.g. 50 to 1000 C below the freezing point of the mixture. Accordingly, this invention provides a method of obtaining a convenient and practical form of immunological reagents, for example, the immunological reagents used for detecting human chorionic gonadotropin hCCi , luteinizing hormone LH , follicle stimulating hormone FSH or human meno pausal gonadotropin. Moreover, a test plate suitable for performing immunologic reactions is provided, the test plate having at least one well of a capacity of about 0.1 to 1.0 ml., employing reagents which are incompatible with each other in the presence of moisture. In this instance, the incompatible reagents are charged in a volume equal to about 20 to 60 of tic volume of the well.Subsequent freezing and lyophilization of the mixture of reagents in the well gives the test plate ready for use. By following the preceding procedure, technical problems e.g. interaction of the reagents, spilling, excessive foaming, and the like , which are encountered when incompatible reagents simply are added to the well, and the charged plates thereafter are subjected to freezing and lyophilizing conditions, are eliminated or minimized. In a still further refinement of this latter embodiment, the ionic strength of the pre lyophilized reagents is increased by a factor of 2 to 3, preferably 2.5, over the ionic strength of reagents usually used for immunological reagents when the immunological reagents are applied to a test plate having a plurality of shallow, small volume wells of about 0.2 to 0.3 ml. The process of the invention will now be described in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein the separate liquid compositions are simultaneously charged onto the opposite side walls of an upright container and in which Figure lis a front view of a reagent vial showing two lyophilized reagents adhering to each side. Figure 2 is a cross sectional view taken along line 2 2 of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a top view of a system for loading, filling and unloading reagent vials. Figure 4 is a side elevation of the filling system taken along line b4 of Figure 3. Figure 5 is an enlarged view of a reagent vial being filled in the system of Figure 4 taken along line 5 5 of Figure 3. Figure 6 is an enlarged view of a filled reagent vial in the system of Figure 4 taken along line 6 6 of Figure 3. In one aspect of the process of the invention, Figure 3 shows a bath 11 containing a body of freezing liquid 12 such as liquid nitrogen. Mounted within bath 1l are sprockets 13 and 14 which support revolving chain 15 having attached thereto reagent bottle holders 16. Referring now to Figure 4, sprocket 13 is driven by motor 17 through belt drive assembly 18. Motor 17 is controlled through a control circuit and synchronized with a filling machine to align empty reagent bottles 19 for filling. Depending from the filling machine are pipettes 20 and 21 shown in raised position in Figure 4 and in lowered position inside reagent bottle 19 in Figure 5. Pipettes 20 and 21 have tips 22 and 23 respectfully, directed outwardly towards the side walls of reagent bottle 19. Each reagent solution or suspension is pumped through a proportioning pump in the filling machine, thereby measuring a predetermined amount of solution per unit time, into pipettes 20 and 21 each of which discharges a predetermined, accurately measured amount of reagent onto the sides of the reagent bottle 19, which reagents 24 and 25 immediately freeze to the side of the bottle and do not mix at the bottom, as is shown in Figure 6.Reagent bottles 19 are removed from holders 16 at the unloading station and placed in racks for lyophilization after which they are capped with cap 26 and ready for use as shown in Figure 1. The process of the invention can be illustrated with respect to reagents for an immunological or diagnostic test for detecting the presence of human chorionic gonadotrophin hCG in urine, which test is utilized in the diagnosis of pregnancy. Likewise, the process of this invention can be illustrated with respect to reagents for an immunological or diagnostic test for detecting the presence of luteinizing hormone LH in urine, which test is utilized in detecting ovulation in cycling women. In these instances, the liquid reagent compositions are aqueous. An example of particular reagents that may be used for detecting hCG or LH are those described in U.S. Patent 4,123,343, granted October 31, 1978 to J. Krupey and E.F. Welchner and in European Patent Publication No.102, published December 20, 1978, and Japanese Patent Application No. 8719 1979, published January 23, 1979, of M.A. Hirsch, D.S. Irvine and J. Krupey. EXAMPLE 1Pregnancy Test Reagents Immunologic and antiserum compositions useful as reagents in hemagglutination inhibition tests for pregnancy were prepared. A liquid composition of stabilized hCG sensitized red blood cells was prepared by suspending the cells in a lyophilization medium which contained a suitable carbohydrate diluent, buffer, sodium chloride, normal rabbit serum, merthiolate and ethylenediaminetetracetic acid EDTA . A liquid composition of antiserum in the same lyophilization medium was prepared. The amount of antiserum in the liquid composition was adjusted to give a predetermined test sensitivity. In one embodiment 50 microliters of each of the cell suspension and the antiserum solution, were simultaneously injected onto the inner surface of a siliconized round bottom vial having an internal diamater of 12 16 mm which uas precooled in an acetone dry ice bath at about 700 C and were instan taneously frozen. In a second embodiment the two liquid compositions were cooled separately to a temperature of 2 5 C and then mixed. Immediately thereafter, 0.1 ml of the mixture was injected into the bottom of a round bottomed vial, siliconized on its inner surface and having an internal diameter of 12 16 mm, the round bottomed vial having been precooled in an acetone dry ice bath at about 70 C. The mixture instantly froze. The frozen reagents of each embodiment were lyophilized immediately in a freeze dryer for 16 20 hours at about 75 to 200 micron Hg. The dried material of both embodiments performed as anticipated when tested for specific sensitivity to hCG. EXAMPLE 2Pregnancy Test Reagents Simultaneous Charging Sensitized red blood cell suspension and antiserum solution were prepared as described in the art and Example I and having quantities adjusted so that volumes of 50 microliters or less contained the material necessary to give a predetermined test sensitivity. The two reagent solutions were cooled to a temperature of 2 4 C and then simultaneously injected from an automatic pipette into the bottom of a series of wells contained in a multiwelled plate, sold under the trademark I Iicrotiter which had been precooled in a dry iceisopropanol mixture and were instantaneously frozen.The plate containing the reEgents was lyophilized in a freeze dryer for 16 20 hours at about 75 to 200 microns Hg. The plate in the freeze dryer rested on a dry ice, pre cooled aluminium block. The dried materials performed as anticipated when tested for specified sensitivity to hCG. EXAMPLE 3Pregnancy Test Reagents Single charging Each of the two liquid compositions, described in Example 1, were cooled to a temperature of 2 40 C, mixed and immediately injected from an automatic pipette. 0.1 ml aliquots into the bottom of a series of wells contained in a multiwelled plate, sold under the trademark nlicroiter , which had been precooled in a dry ice isopropanol mixture. The mixture of the liquid compositions instantly froze. The plate containing the reagents was lyophilized in a freeze dryer for 16 20 hr at about 70 to 200 microns Hg. The plate in the freeze dryer rested on a dry ice, precooled aluminiun block. The dried materials performed as anticipated when tested for specified sensitivity to hCG. EXAMPLE 4Ovulation Test Reagents a Preparation of first liquid composition A suspension of stabilized, sensitized red blood cells see EuropeanPatent Application noted above was washed three times with a 0.15M phosphate buffer solution pH 7.0 . The washed cells were resuspended as a 0.625 v v suspension in a lyophilization buffer pH 7.0 , prepared from 25g of sucrose, 25 ml of 1 merthiolate, 10 ml of normal rabbit serum NRS, triply absorbed and q.s. to 1 liter with 0.375 M phosphate buffer saline PBS containing EDTA, the EDTA being 0.125 M with respect to the PBS. b Preparation of second liquid composition A non specific hCG or specific LH antiserum, prepared according to the procedure described in European Patent Publication No.102 was diluted further with 0.15 M phosphate buffer saline pH 7.0 containing 0.296 NRS triply absorbed . The extent of dilution with the PBS was such that the proper concentration of antiserum was present in a 50 p1 aliquot of the second reagent to give a predetermined test sensitivity with 50 IA aliquot of the first reagent. These above liquid compositions may be stored at 100 C. The first and second liquid compositions were each cooled separately to 2 to 5 C and the cooled reagents were mixed. Tile cooled mixture 2 to 5 C was immediately injected from an automatic pipette 0.1 ml aliquots into the bottom of a series of wells contained in a multiwelled plate, sold under the trademark Microtiter , which had been precooled in a dry iceisopropanol mixture. The mixture instantly froze. The plate containing the reagents was lyophilized in a freeze dryer for 16 20 hr at about 70 to 200 microns Hg. The plate in the freeze dryer rested on an aluminum block precooled with dry ice. The dried materials performed as anticipated when tested for specified sensitivity to LIS, after the reagents in each well were mixed with 0.25 ml of the urine to be tested. By following the procedure of this example but applying the cooled mixture to a round bottomed tube, siliconized on its inner surface instead of the Microtiter plate, the tube having been precooled in an acetone dryice bath at about 700 C, followed by immediately treating the tube and mixture of reagents to the lyophilization procedure described in Example 1, a convenient and efficaceous preparation to the lyophilized immunological reagent also was obtained.
