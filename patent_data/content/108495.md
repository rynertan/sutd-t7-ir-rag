# Hand held aerosol dispenser.

## Abstract
Apparatus according to the present invention comprises a continuous resilient member 2 , a first portion 6 of which is adapted to engage the body of an aerosol container, a second portion 7 of which is adapted to engage the actuator of the aerosol container, and a portion 3 of the member extending between said first and second portions being arranged to form a handle wherein grasping of the handle urges said first portion towards said second portion. Urging of the first portion towards the second portion has the effect of pressing the nozzle 8 towards the body of the container 1 causing release of a spray from the nozzle.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. Marker apparatus characterised in comprising a continuous resilient member 2 a first portion 6 of which is adapted to engage the body of an aerosol container, a second portion 7 of which is adapted to engage the actuator of the aerosol container, and a portion 3 of the member extending between said first and second portions being arranged to form a handle wherein grasping of the handle urges said first portion towards the second portion. 2. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that grasping of the handles causes the nozzle of the aerosol container to press towards the container, causing release of spray from said container. 3.

Apparatus as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that handle 3 comprises a V shaped fold in the member. 5. Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, characterised in that the handle 3 is disposed alongside the container. 6. Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the handle 3 is disposed remote from the container. 7. Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, characterised in comprising means 11 for securing the container thereto. 8. Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, characterised in comprising a hinged portion 22 movable to facilitate attachment of said aerosol container. 9. Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, characterised in that the member 16 comprises a slidable adjustment 19, 20.

## Description
HAND HELD AEROSOL DISPENSERThis invention relates particularly to marker devices of the kind used for marking a line on surface areas, for example in factories, warehouses, public buildings, car parks, roads and sportsgrounds. This invention also relates to devices which may be used for dispensing paint or other materials from aerosol containers.According to the present invention apparatus comprises a continuous resilient member, a first portion of which is adapted to engage the body of an aerosol container, a second portion of which is adapted to engage the actuator of the aerosol container, and a portion of the member extending between said first and second portions being arranged to form a handle wherein grasping of the handle urges said first portion towards said second portion.The actuator of the aerosol container usually comprises the nozzle or outlet. Urging of the first portion towards the second portion has the effect of pressing the nozzle towards the body of the container, causing release of a spray from the nozzle.The handle may comprise a portion of the resilient member which has been bent back upon itself so that the member may be completely grasped adjacent the point of bending back. The handle portion may, for example, take the form of a V shaped fold in the member.The handle may be disposed either alongside the container or remote from it. When the handle is disposed alongside the container the apparatus may be held in the hand for use in spraying at close quarters.The handle may alternatively be located remote from the container to provide access for spraying in inaccessible places or for spraying ground surfaces without the user needing to bend over.Apparatus in accordance with this invention may further comprise means for securing the container. This may comprise one or more clips, loops, guides or catches attached to the member and arranged to engage the container.The invention is further described by way of examples with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which Figure 1 shows an apparatus in accordance with the invention Figure 2 is an alternative apparatus Figure 3 is a perspective view of the apparatus shown in Figure 1 andFigure 4 illustrates a second alternative apparatus.Figure 1 shows in dotted lines an aerosol container 1 disposed in apparatus in accordance with the invention.The apparatus comprises a continuous length of resilient metal rod 2 shaped to form a handle 3 and a portion 4 extending to a point 6 of engagement with the rear of the container 1 and a second portion 5 extending to a point of engagement with the nozzle 8 of the aerosol container. The engagement with the nozzle 8 may be by means of a ring 7 attached to the rod 2 and surrounding the nozzle or by any other convenient means. Grasping of the handle 3 by a user causes the ring 7 to bear against the nozzle 8 and the engagement 6 to bear against the rear of the container, causing release of spray from the container. This apparatus is adapted for use in spraying a ground surface by a standing user. The container 1 is secured to the rod 5 by a loose fitting clip 11.Figure 2 illustrates similar apparatus for use in spraying at close quarters. The handle 10 is located between the engagement with the rear of the container 12 and the ring 13 which engages the nozzle of the container. A clip 14 serves to engage the aerosol canister. The clip 14 may fit tightly around the canister although a loose fitting ring may also be used.The clip may take the form of a spring clip 15 as is shown in Figure 3. Alternatively, a circular loop may be provided to prevent undue lateral movement of the canister. Apparatus in accordance with this invention may be constructed from any resilient material including metals or plastics material.Figure 4 illustrates a modification of the invention.The resilient rod 16 comprises two portions 17, 18 slidably fastened together by means of a slidable adjustment comprising a collar 19 provided with a wing nut 20. This allows the apparatus to be adjusted to accommodate aerosol containers of various lengths. The portion 18 is provided with a hinge 21 permitting articulation of the tip 18 which in use engages the nozzle of an aerosol container. A tube 23 is arranged to slide along the portion 18 to lock the hinge 21. An alternative apparatus for spraying the ground by a standing user may be provided with an elongated handle similar to that shown inFigure 1.
