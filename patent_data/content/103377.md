# A COMPOSITE PRODUCT COMPRISING A RIGID SUPPORT TO WHICH FOAM MATERIAL IS MOULDED AND A METHOD OF MAKING THE SAME

## Abstract
A cellular foam product is formed as a composite struc ture of a supporting substrate W and cellular foam mate rial 44 . A continuous barrier film 30 is vacuum bonded to a load supporting structure W the surface of which has previously been coated with an adhesive. The barrier film seals openings in the structure through which gas pressure loss and foam leakage may occur during subsequent foam generating reaction processes.
