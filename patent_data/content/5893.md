# Improved safety containers.

## Abstract
An improved container and safety stopper combination of the type which includes a container 10 , a stopper 12 hingedly connected to the lip 16 of the container, and a pin 26 slidably mounted in a slide channel 24 formed in the stopper and having an enlarged outer portion 40 adapted to engage a recess 28 in the lip 16 of the container to lock the stopper in its closed position. Means are provided to prevent the pin 26 from sliding outwardly or inwardly unless manually pulled or pushed respectively. When the stopper 12 is closed and the pin 26 is fully inserted, the upper side of the enlarged outer portion 40 of the pin is spaced from the stopper the minimum distance sufficient to allow the fingernail of an adult user to fit within a laterally extending groove 42 in the enlarged outer portion 40 so that the pin 26 can be pulled outwardly. Also disclosed is a safety cap including a stopper seat 70 which can be permanently attached to the lip of a container for liquids, a stopper 72 hingedly connected to the stopper seat, and a pin 74 slidably mounted in a channel 102 formed in the stopper. When the stopper is closed, a plug 96 extending from the stopper seals the passage 86 extending through a spout 80 which projects upwardly from the stopper seat. Thereafter, when the pin 74 is fully inserted, a flange 84 on the spout engages the pin and prevents the stopper from being swung to its open position.
