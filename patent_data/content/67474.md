# Resistive paste for a resistor body.

## Abstract
Resistive paste for manufacturing a resistor body by means of screen printing the paste on a substrate, followed by firing. The paste comprises a silver palladium alloy, a metal oxidic compound which contains either PdO and or can react therewith, a permanent and a temporary binder. The metal oxidic compound may be provided as a layer on the AgPd particles or be mixed therewith. The result is a low ohmic resistor having a TRC 100 10 ‚Å∂ C in the range from 60 to 200 C.
