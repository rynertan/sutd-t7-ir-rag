# Tape cartridge static eliminator.

## Abstract
Static electric charge build up is eliminated in tape cassettes having a housing with a take off spool and a take up spool for magnetic tape mounted in the housing. First and second tape guide support pins 11, 12 are mount ed in the housing on the take off spool side. A stationary metal guide sleeve 13 is disposed on the first pin 11 and an electrically conductive plastic guide roller 16 is rotat ably mounted on the second pin 12 . The magnetic tape path through the cassette housing is such that the back side of the tape engages the metal guide sleeve 13 and the magnetic coating side of the tape is against the plastic guide roller 16 . A smooth flat metal member 17 is mounted for electrical contact against adjacent ends of the metal sleeve 13 and the plastic roller 16 to complete an electric path therebetween. This cancels the electrostatic charges on the plastic roller 16 and the magnetic coating of the tape.
