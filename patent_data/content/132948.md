# Biochemical detection method and kit for use therein.

## Abstract
A biochemical detection method in which a ligand is bound to a surface, an aqueous solution containing an anti ligand is brought into contact therewith whereby antiligand becomes bound to ligand, the aqueous solution is separated from the thus bound antiligand, and the antiligand is detected using a detection means associated therewith, for example using amplified enzyme linked immunoassay. The surface is treated with at least one agent for limiting non specific binding of either the ligand or the antiligand with other substrates, which agent is i a surfactant containing an aromatic residue and hav ing an HLB number of at least 16, ii a zwitterionic surfactant, or iii a solution containing a salt of a polyvalent anion, in a concentration of at least 100mM. Preferably, all three agents are used simultaneously. The three agents may be used during the detection procedure in solutions containing the antiligand, in washing solutions used during the method, or in solutions used to pre treat the plate.
