# Railway control signal dynamic output interlocking systems.

## Abstract
A computer based railway interlocking control system, preferably of the parallel redundant type in order to provide enhanced reliability as compared to a single computer system. The railway traffic control devices, e.g. points and signals, are arranged to be controlled by signals in one of two possible steady states, the interlocking con trol means 30, 31, 32, is arranged to produce con trol signals in the steady state for de energised or safe device settings and in an alternating state for energised or potentially unsafe settings. The alternating control signals 33, 34, 35 or 38 must be converted to the corresponding steady state to operate the devices thus, the converting or restoring circuit discriminates against dormant wrong side failures, i.e. unsafe signals to increase the inherent safety of the system.
