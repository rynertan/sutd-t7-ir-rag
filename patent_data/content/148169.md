# High concentration encapsulation of water soluble materials.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for encapsulation, and particularly to the production of small or minute capsules constituted by a skin or thin wall of polymeric material e.g., polyurea, polyamide, polysulfonamide, poly ester, polycarbonate, or polyurethane, which involves first providing an organic liquid continuous phase liquid con taining an oil soluble alkylated polyvinylpyrrolidone emulsi fier A discontinuous aqueous phase liquid containing a water soluble material, which is the material to be encapsu lated, plus a first shell wall component is dispersed in the continuous phase liquid to form a water in oil emulsion. The second shell wall component is added to the water in oil emulsion whereupon the first shell wall component reacts with the second shell wall component to form a solid polymeric shell wall about the material to be encapsulated. The capsules formed may be directly used as in the form of an organic suspension, i.e., a suspension of microcapsules in the organic liquid.
