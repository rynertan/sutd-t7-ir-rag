# Fire resistant connections and double ribbed sealing means therefor.

## Abstract
A fire resistant connection 28 that embodies a sealing means 36 and that is operable for purposes of effectuating the establishment of a fire resistant seal between mating surfaces 32, 34 , and in particular mating surfaces 32, 34 of the type that commonly are found to be present in wellhead and valve equipment 10 . The subject fire resistant connec tion 28 includes mating seal surfaces 32, 34 and the aforementioned sealing means 36 . The sealing means 36 comprises a seal ring 36 , which includes a plurality of seal lips 38,40 and a pair of scalloped ribs 42, 44 , the latter 42, 44 being formed on the seal ring 36 so as to be located in interposed relation between a pair of adjacent seal lips 38, 40 . Each of the plurality of seal lips 38, 40 is suitably configured so as to be positionable in sealing engagement with a corresponding one of the mating seal surfaces 32, 34 , the latter 32, 34 embodying a configuration that is complementary in nature to that of the seal lip 38, 40 engaged thereby. Likewise, the pair of ribs 42, 44 are suitably configured such that when the seal lips 38, 40 are in sealing engagement with the mating seal surfaces 32, 34 , the pair of ribs 42, 44 are also engaged by the mating seal surfaces 32, 34 and are locked in position thereby.
