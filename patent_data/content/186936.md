# Method and apparatus for evaluating auditory distortions of an audio system.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for evaluating the auditory dis tortions of an audio system, wherein an audio signal, whose auditory distortions are to be evaluated, is filtered by a notch filter 401 to remove its fundamental frequency, and is then fed through a primary weighting network 402 com prising three high pass filters followed by a secondary weighting network 403 . The filtered, weighted signal is then amplified 404 , rectified, further filtered 405 , com pared 406 by taking the ratio with the magnitude of original signal and finally fed to a display unit 407 to show a figure that represents auditory distortion characteristics consis tent with what is actually appreciated by human auditory fa culties.
