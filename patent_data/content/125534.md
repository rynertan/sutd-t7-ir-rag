# THERMO MAGNETIC RECORDING OF BINARY DIGITAL INFORMATION

## Abstract
A thermo magnetic method for recording of a bit of information in each domain of an amorphous alloy thin film layer supporting small stable domains. Each domain in the recording layer is first magnetized in a first direction, corres ponding to a first binary state, by exposure to a saturation magnetic field. The remaining binary state is temporarily or permanently recorded in a particular domain by heating to a lower or higher temperature that domain volume of the recording layer and thereafter cooling the heated domain in the presence of a bias magnetic field of direction opposite to, and magnitude less than, the saturation field. The binary state of each domain is read by interrogation with a beam of energy and utilization of differential effects between the interrogation beam and the direction of the magnetic field in the interrogated domain.
