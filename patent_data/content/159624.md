## Description
The instant invention relates to a novel class of three dimensional microporous crystalline molecular sieves, to the method of their preparation and to their use as adsorbents and catalysts. The invention relates to novel molecular sieves having at least one element capable of forming a framework oxide units, e.g., ELO₂ , with tetrahedral oxide units of aluminum AlO 2 , phosphorus PO 2 and silicon SiO₂ . These compositions may be prepared hydrothermally from gels containing reactive compounds of silicon, aluminum and phosphorus and at least one additional element capable of forming a framework oxide unit, and preferably at least one organic templating agent which may function in part to determine the course of the crystallization mechanism and the structure of the crystalline product. Molecular sieves of the crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite type are well known in the art and now comprise over 150 species of both naturally occurring and synthetic compositions. In general the crystalline zeolites are formed from corner sharing AlO₂ and SiO₂ tetrahedra and are characterized by having pore openings of uniform dimensions, having a significant ion exchange capacity and being capable of reversibly desorbing an adsorbed phase which is dispersed throughout the internal voids of the crystal without displacing any atoms which make up the permanent crystal structure. Other crystalline microporous compositions which are not zeolitic, i.e. do not contain AlO₂ tetrahedra as essential framework constituents, but which exhibit the ion exchange and or adsorption characteristics of the zeolites are also known. Metal organosilicates which are said to possess ion exchange properties, have uniform pores and are capable of reversibly adsorbing molecules having molecular diameters of about 0.6 nm 6Å or less, are reported in U.S. Patent No. 3,941,871 issued March 2, 1976 to Dwyer et al. A pure silica polymorph, silicalite, having molecular sieving properties and a neutral framework containing neither cations nor cation sites is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,061,724 issued December 6, 1977 to R.W. Grose et al. A recently reported class of microporous compositions and the first framework oxide molecular sieves synthesized without silica, are the crystalline aluminophosphate compositions disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,310,440 issued January 12, 1982 to Wilson et al. These materials are formed from AlO₂ and PO₂ tetrahedra and have electrovalently neutral frameworks as in the case of silica polymorphs. Unlike the silica molecular sieve, silicalite, which is hydrophobic due to the absence of extra structural cations, the aluminophosphate molecular sieves are moderately hydrophilic, apparently due to the difference in electronegativity between aluminum and phosphorus. Their intracrystalline pore volumes and pore diameters are comparable to those known for zeolites and silica molecular sieves. In copending and commonly assigned US Patent application Serial No. 400,438, filed July 26, 1982, there is described a novel class of silicon substituted aluminophosphates which are both microporous and crystalline. The materials have a three dimensions crystal framework of PO 2, AlO 2 and SiO₂ tetrahedral unites and, exclusive of any alkali metal or calcium which may optionally be present, an as synthesized empirical chemical composition on an anhydrous basis of In copending and commonly assigned US Patent application Serial No. 480,738, filed March 31, 1983 there is described a novel class of titanium containing molecular sieves whose chemical composition in the as synthesized and anhydrous form is represented by the unit empirical formula In copending and commonly assigned US Patent application Serial No. 514,334, filed July 15, 1983, there is described a novel class of crystalline metal aluminophosphates having three dimensional microporous framework structures of MO₂, AlO₂ and PO₂ tetrahedral units and having an empirical chemical composition on an anhydrous basis expressed by the formula In copending and commonly assigned US Patent application Serial No. 514,335, filed July 15, 1983, there is described a novel class of crystalline ferroaluminophosphates having a three dimensional microporous framework structure of FeO₂, AlO₂ and PO₂ tetrahedral units and having an empirical chemical composition on an anhydrous basis expressed by the formula The instant invention relates to new molecular sieve compositions having at least one element other than silicon, aluminum and phosphorus where such element is capable of forming a framework oxide unit with AlO 2, PO 2, and SiO₂ tetrahedral oxide units. FIG. 1 is a ternary diagram wherein parameters relating to the instant compositions are set forth as mole fractions. FIG. 2 is a ternary diagram wherein parameters relating to preferred compositions are set forth as mole fractions. FIG. 3 is a ternary diagram wherein parameters relating to the reaction mixtures employed in the preparation of the compositions of this invention are set forth as mole fractions. The instant invention relates to a new class of molecular sieves in which at least one element capable of forming a framework oxide unit is provided to form crystal framework structures of SiO₂, AlO 2, PO 2 and ELO n 2 units wherein EL represents at least one element present as a framework oxide unit ELO n 2 with charge n where n may be 3, 2, 1, 0 or 1. These new molecular sieves exhibit ion exchange, adsorption and catalytic properties and, accordingly, find wide use as adsorbents and catalysts. The members of this novel class of compositions have crystal framework structures of SiO₂, AlO 2, PO 2 and ELO n 2 framework oxide units, where n is 3, 2, 1, 0 or 1, and have an empirical chemical composition on an anhydrous basis expressed by the formula The molecular sieves of the instant invention will be generally referred to by the acronym ELAPSO to designate element s EL in an oxide framework of SiO₂, AlO 2, PO 2 and ELO n 2 oxide units. Actual class members will be identified by replacing the EL of the acronym with the element s present as a ELO n 2 oxide unit s . For example CoAPSO designates a molecular sieve comprised of SiO₂, AlO 2, PO 2 and CoO 2 2 and or CoO 1 2 framework oxide units, and CoZnAPSO designates a molecular sieve having SiO₂, AlO 2, PO 2, CoO 2 2 and or CoO 1 2 and ZnO 2 2 framework oxide units. To identify various structural species which make up each of the subgeneric classes, each species is assigned a number and is identified as ELAPSO i wherein i is an integer. This designation is an arbitrary one and is not intended to denote structural relationship to another material s which may also be characterized by a numbering system. The instant invention relates to a new class of three dimensional microporous crystalline molecular sieves in which at least one element capable of forming a framework oxide unit is provided to form crystal framework structures of SiO₂, AlO 2, PO 2 and ELO n 2 framework oxide units wherein EL represents at least one element capable of forming a framework oxide unit ELO n 2 with charge n where n is 3, 2, 1, 0 or 1. These new molecular sieves exhibit ion exchange, adsorption and catalytic properties and accordingly find wide use as adsorbents and catalysts. The ELAPSO compositions are formed with elements capable of forming framework oxide units in the presence of SiO₂, AlO 2 and PO 2 tetrahedral oxide units where element EL is at least one element capable of forming a three dimensional oxide framework in the presence of aluminum, phosphorus and silicon oxide units, and has a mean T O distance in tetrahedral oxide structures of between 1.51 Angstroms and 2.06 Angstroms 1 Angstrom equals 0.1 nm , has a cation electronegativity between 523 kJ g atom and 1297 kJ g atom 125 kcal g atom and 310 kcal g atom and is capable of forming stable M O P, M O Al or M O M bonds in crystalline three dimensional oxide structures where the M O bond dissociation energy, D , is greater than 246.9 kJ mole 59 kcal mole at 298 K. The use of M in the aforementioned discussion on bond energies is one of convenience since the prior art has heretofore employed M to designate the element EL bonded to oxygen. For the purposes of discussion herein any reference to M O P, M O Al, M O M or M O refers to the substitution of element s EL for the M designation. The T O distance denominates the bond length of the T O bond where T is element s EL occupying the tetrahedral cation site and is related to the Shannon Prewitt crystal or ionic radii. Elements known to occur in tetrahedral coordination with oxygen are discussed in Joseph V. Smith, Feldspar Minerals , Springer Verlag, Berlin, New York, Vol. I, pp. 55 65 and 106 113 1974 R. D. Shannon, Further embodiments of the instant invention relate to the molecular sieves as above defined being characterized by element s EL characterized by at least one of the following criteria In one embodiment of the invention element EL is preferably at least one element selected from the group consisting of arsenic, beryllium, boron, chromium, cobalt, gallium, germanium, iron, lithium, magnesium, manganese, titanium, vanadium and zinc. The relative amounts of silicon, aluminum, phosphorus and element s EL are expressed by the empirical chemical formula anhydrous The molecular sieves of the instant invention have three dimensional microporous crystalline framework structures of ELO n 2, AlO 2, PO 2 and SiO₂ framework oxide units having an empirical chemical composition on an anhydrous basis expressed by the formula where p is an integer correspondig to the number of elements EL in the EL In a preferred subclass of the ELAPSO molecular sieves the values of w , x , y and z , where w is as above defined, in the above formula are within the tetragonal compositional area defined by points a, b, c and d of the ternary diagram which is FIG. 2, said points a, b, c and d representing the following values for w , x , y and z where p is as above defined. While it is believed that the elements EL , aluminum, phosphorus and silicon in the framework constituents are present in tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, i.e. as tetrahedral oxide units, it is theoretically possible that some fraction of these framework constituents are present in coordination with five or six oxygen atoms. The convenient reference herein to the framework oxide units are represented by formulae which indicate tetrahedral oxide units, although as above noted other than tetrahedral coordination may exist. It is not, moreover, necessarily the case that all the elements EL of any given synthesized product be part of the framework in the aforementioned types of coordination with oxygen. Some of each constituent may be in some as yet undetermined form. The ELAPSOs of this invention are useful as adsorbents, catalysts, ion exchangers, and the like in much the same fashion as aluminosilicates have been employed heretofore, although their chemical and physical properties are not necessarily similar to those observed for aluminosilicates. ELAPSO compositions are generally synthesized by hydrothermal crystallization from a reaction mixture containing active sources of element s EL , silicon, aluminum and phosphorus, preferably an organic templating, i.e., structure directing, agent which is preferably a compound of an element of Group VA of the Periodic Table, and or optionally an alkali or other metal. The reaction mixture is generally placed in a sealed pressure vessel, preferably lined with an inert plastic material such as polytetrafluoroethylene and heated, preferably under autogenous pressure at an effective temperature which is preferably between about 50 C and about 250 C, more preferably between 100 C and 200 C, until crystals of the ELAPSO product are obtained, usually an effective crystallization time of from several hours to several weeks. Generally, effective crystallization times of from about 2 hours to about 30 days are employed with typically from 4 hours to about 20 days being employed to obtain ELAPSO products. The product is recovered by any convenient method such as centrifugation or filtration. In synthesizing the ELAPSO compositions of the instant invention, it is preferred to employ a reaction mixture composition expressed in terms of molar ratios as follows In the foregoing expression of the reaction composition, the reactants are normalized with respect to the total of w , x , y , and z such that In forming reaction mixtures from which the ELAPSO molecular sieves are formed an organic templating agent is preferably employed and may be any of those heretofore proposed for use in the synthesis of conventional zeolite aluminosilicates. In general these compounds contain elements of Group VA of the Periodic Table of Elements, particularly nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic and antimony, preferably nitrogen or phosphorous and most preferably nitrogen, which compounds also contain at least one alkyl or aryl group having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms. Particularly preferred compounds for use as templating agents are the amines, quarternary phosphonium and quaternary ammonium compounds, the latter two being represented generally by the formula R₄X wherein X is nitrogen or phosphorous and each R is an alkyl or aryl group containing from 1 to 8 carbon atoms. Polymeric quaternary ammonium salts such as C₁₄H₃₂N₂ OH ₂ The source of silicon may be silica, either as a silica sol or as fumed silica, a reactive solid amorphous precipitated silica, silica gel, alkoxides of silicon, silica containing clays silicic acid or alkali metal silicate and mixtures thereof. The most suitable phosphorus source yet found for the present process is phosphoric acid, but organic phosphates such as triethyl phosphate have been found satisfactory, and so also have crystalline or amorphous aluminophosphates such as the AlPO₄ compositions of U.S.P. 4,310,440. Organo phosphorus compounds, such as tetrabutylphosphonium bromide do not, apparently, serve as reactive sources of phosphorus, but these compounds do function as templating agents. Conventional phosphorus salts such as sodium metaphosphate, may be used, at least in part, as the phosphorus source, but are not preferred. The preferred aluminum source is either an aluminum alkoxide, such as aluminum isoproproxide, or pseudoboehmite. The crystalline or amorphous aluminophosphates which are a suitable source of phosphorus are, of course, also suitable sources of aluminum. Other sources of aluminum used in zeolite synthesis, such as gibbsite, aluminum containing clays, sodium aluminate and aluminum trichloride, can be employed but are not preferred. The element s EL can be introduced into the reaction system in any form which permits the formation While not essential to the synthesis of ELAPSO compositions, stirring or other moderate agitation of the reaction mixture and or seeding the reaction mixture with seed crystals of either the ELAPSO species to be produced or a topologically similar aluminophosphate, aluminosilicate or molecular sieve composition, facilitates the crystallization procedure. After crystallization the ELAPSO product may be isolated and advantageously washed with water and dried in air. The as synthesized ELAPSO generally contains within its internal pore system at least one form of any templating agent employed in its formation. Most commonly this organic moiety, derived from any organic template, is present, at least in part, as a charge balancing cation as is generally the case with as synthesized aluminosilicate zeolites prepared from organic containing reaction systems. It is possible, however, that some or all of the organic moiety may be an occluded molecular species in a particular ELAPSO species. As a general rule the templating agent, and hence the occluded organic species, is too large to move freely through the pore system of the ELAPSO product and must be removed by calcining the ELAPSO at temperatures of 200 C to 700 C to thermally degrade the organic species. In some instances the pores of the ELAPSO compositions are sufficiently large to permit transport of the templating agent, particularly if the latter is a small molecule, and accordingly complete or partial removal thereof may be accomplished by conventional desorption procedures such as carried out in the case of zeolites. It will be understood that the term as synthesized as used herein does not include the condition of ELAPSO species wherein any organic moiety occupying the intracrystalline pore system as a result of the hydrothermal crystallization process has been reduced by post synthesis treatment such that the value of m in the composition formula Since the present ELAPSO compositions are formed from AlO 2, PO 2, SiO₂ and ELO n 2 framework oxide units which, respectively, have a net charge of 1, 1, 0 and n , where n is 3, 2, 1, 0 or 1, the matter of cation exchangeability is considerably more complicated than in the case of zeolitic molecular sieves in which, ideally, there is a stoichiometric relationship between AlO 2 tetrahedra and charge balancing cations. In the instant compositions, an AlO 2 tetrahedron can be balanced electrically either by association with a PO 2 tetrahedron or a simple cation such as an alkali metal cation, a cation of the element EL present in the reaction mixture, or an organic cation derived from the templating agent. Similarly, an ELO n 2 oxide unit can be balanced electrically by association with PO 2 tetrahedra, a simple cation such as an alkali metal cation, a cation of the metal EL , organic cations derived from the templating agent, or other divalent or polyvalent metal cations introduced from an extraneous source. It has also been postulated that non adjacent AlO 2 and PO 2 tetrahedral pairs can be balanced by Na and OH respectively Flanigen and Grose, Molecular Sieve Zeolites I, ACS, Washington, DC 1971 . The ELAPSO compositions of the present invention may exhibit cation exchange capacity when analyzed using ion exchange techniques heretofore employed with zeolitic aluminosilicates and have pore diameters which are inherent in the lattice structure of each species and which are at least about 3Å in diameter. Ion exchange of ELAPSO compositions will ordinarily be possible only after the organic moiety present as a result of synthesis has been removed from the pore system. Dehydration to remove water present in the as synthesized ELAPSO compositions can usually be accomplished, to some degree at least, in the usual manner without removal of the organic moiety, but the absence of the organic species greatly facilitates adsorption and desorption procedures. The ELAPSO materials will have various degrees of hydrothermal and thermal stability, some being quite remarkable in this regard, and will function as molecular sieve adsorbents and hydrocarbon conversion catalysts or catalyst bases. In the examples a stainless steel reaction vessel is utilized which is lined with an inert plastic material, polytetrafluoroethylene, to avoid contamination of the reaction mixture. In general, the final reaction mixture from which each ELAPSO composition is crystallized is prepared by forming mixtures of less than all of the reagents and thereafter incorporating into these mixtures additional reagents either singly or in the form of other intermediate mixtures of two or more reagents. In some instances the admixed reagents retain their identity in the intermediate mixture and in other cases some or all of the reagents are involved in chemical reactions to produce new reagents. The term mixture is applied in both cases. Further, unless otherwise specified, each intermediate mixture as well as the final reaction mixture was stirred until substantially homogeneous. X ray patterns of reaction products are obtained by X ray analysis using standard X ray powder diffraction techniques. The radiation source is a high intensity, copper target, X ray tube operated at 50 Kv and 40 mA. The diffraction pattern from the copper K alpha radiation and graphite monochromator is suitably recorded by an X ray spectrometer scintillation counter, pulse height analyzer and strip chart recorder. Flat compressed powder samples are scanned at 2 2 theta per minute, using a two second time constant. Interplanar spacings d in Angstrom units are obtained from the position of the diffraction peaks expressed as 2ϑ where ϑ is the Bragg angle as observed on the strip chart. Intensities are determined from the heights of diffraction peaks after subtracting background, I₀ being the intensity of the strongest line or peak, and I being the intensity of each of the other peaks. Alternatively, the X ray patterns are obtained from the copper K alpha radiation by use of computer based techniques using Siemens D 500 X ray powder diffractometers, Siemens Type K 805 X ray sources, available from Siemens Corporation, Cherry Hill, New Jersey, with appropriate computer interface. As will be understood by those skilled in the art the determination of the parameter 2 theta is subject to both human and mechanical error, which in combination, can impose an uncertainty of about 0.4 denotes plus or minus 0.4 on each reported value of 2 theta. This uncertainty is, of course, also manifested in the reported values of the d spacings, which are calculated from the 2 theta values. This imprecision is general throughout the art and is not sufficient to preclude the differentiation of the present crystalline materials from each other and from the compositions of the prior art. In some of the X ray patterns reported, the relative intensities of the d spacings are indicated by the notations vs, s, m, w and vw which represent very strong, strong, medium, weak, and very weak, respectively. In certain instances the purity of a synthesized product may be assessed with reference to its X ray powder diffraction pattern. Thus, for example, if a sample is stated to be pure, it is intended only that the X ray pattern of the sample is free of lines attributable to crystalline impurities, not that there are no amorphous materials present. The molecular sieves of the instant invention may be characterized by their x ray powder diffraction patterns and such may have one of the x ray patterns set forth in the following Tables A through W, wherein said x ray patterns are for both the as synthesized and calcined forms unless otherwise noted The following examples are provided to further illustrate the invention. The ELAPSO molecular sieves of the invention may be prepared having one or more elements present as framework oxide units such that the ELAPSO molecular sieves contain framework oxide units ELO₂ , ALO 2, PO 2 and SiO₂ where EL denominates at least one element capable of forming a framework oxide unit with AlO 2, PO 2 and SiO₂ tetrahedral oxide units. The following ELAPSO molecular sieves are representative of molecular sieves prepared according to the instant invention Molecular sieves containing cobalt, aluminum, phosphorus and silicon as framework tetrahedral oxide units are prepared as follows In the following examples the CoAPSO compositions were prepared using numerous reagents. The reagents employed and abbreviations employed herein, if any, for such reagents are as follows The CoAPSO compositions were prepared by preparing reaction mixtures having a molar composition expressed as The reaction mixtures were prepared by forming a starting reaction mixture comprising the H₃PO₄ and one half of the water. This mixture was stirred and the aluminum source Alipro or CATAPAL added. The resulting mixture was blended until a homogeneous mixture was observed. The LUDOX LS was then added to the resulting mixture and the new mixture blended until a homogeneous mixture was observed. The cobalt source Co Ac ₂, Co SO₄ or mixtures thereof was dissolved in the remaining water and combined with the first mixture. The combined mixture was blended until a homogenous mixture was observed. The organic templating agent was added to this mixture and blended for about two to four minutes until a homogenous mixture was observed. The resulting mixture final reaction mixture was placed in a lined polytetrafluoroethylene stainless steel pressure vessel and digested at a temperature 150 C, 200 C or 225 C for a time. Alternatively, if the digestion temperature was 100 C the final reaction mixture was placed in a lined polytetrafluoroethylene screw top bottle for a time. All digestions were carried out at the autogeneous pressure. The products were removed from the reaction vessel cooled and evaluated as set forth hereinafter. The following examples are provided to further illustrate the invention and are not intended to be limiting thereof CoAPSO molecular sieves were prepared according to the above described procedure and the CoAPSO products determined by x ray analysis. The results of examples 1A to 31A are set forth in Tables I A and II A. Tables I A and II A also contain examples AA to EA wherein X ray analysis of the reaction mixture product did not show CoAPSO products. In the Tables I A and II A, the reaction mixtures are described as the ratio of molar oxides Examples 32A to 61A were carried out using di n propylamine as the organic templating agent. The preparative procedure was as above described except that in examples 39A to 45A and 53A to 61A the preparative procedure was modified such that the cobalt acetate was added to the phosphoric acid and water, followed by addition of the aluminum source, silicon source and then the organic templating agent. The aluminum source in examples 32A to 45A, 60A and 61A was aluminum isoproproxide and in examples 46A to 59A the aluminum source was CATAPAL. The reaction mixtures for examples 32A to 61A are described in terms of the molar oxide ratios Examples 62A to 83A were carried out according to the preparative procedure employed in examples 1A to 31A except that the organic templating agent was as TEAOH tetraethylammonium hydroxide . The reaction mixtures for examples 62A to 83A were The results of examples 62A to 83A are set forth in Table IV A. Examples 84A to 106A were carried out according to the preparative procedure employed in examples 1A to 31A except the organic template was as is shown in Table V A.

The reactor was a cylindrical quartz tube 254 mm. in length an 10.3 mm. I.D. In each test the reactor was loaded with particles of the test CoMnMgAPSO s which were 20 40 mesh U.S. Std. in size and in an amount of from 0.5 to 5 grams, the quantity being selected so that the conversion of n butane was at least 5 and not more than 90 under the test conditions. The CoMnMgAPSO samples were calcined in air at 600 C for 1.5 hours to remove organic materials from the pore system, and were activated The ELAPSO compositions of the instant invention exhibit novel surface selectivity characteristics which render them useful as catalysts or catalyst bases in a number of hydrocarbon conversion and oxidative combustion reactions. They can be impregnated or otherwise loaded with catalytically active metals by methods well known in the art and used, for example, in fabricating catalyst compositions having silica or alumina bases. Of the general class, those species having pores larger than about 4Å are preferred for catalytic applications. Among the hydrocarbon conversion reactions catalyzed by ELAPSO compositions are cracking, hydrocracking, alkylation for both the aromatic and isoparaffin types, isomerization including xylene isomerization, polymerization, reforming, hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, transalkylation, dealkylation, hydrodecyclization and dehydrocyclization. Using ELAPSO catalyst compositions which contain a hydrogenation promoter such as platinum or palladium, heavy petroleum residual stocks, cyclic stocks and other hydrocrackable charge stocks, can be hydrocracked at temperatures in the range of 205 C to 440 C 400 F to 825 F using molar ratios of hydrogen to hydrocarbon in the range of between 2 and 80, pressures between 69 kPa to 24.1 MPa 10 and 3500 p.s.i.g. , and a liquid hourly space velocity LHSV of from 0.1 to 20, preferably 1.0 to 10. The ELAPSO catalyst compositions employed in hydrocracking are also suitable for use in reforming processes in which the hydrocarbon feedstocks contact the catalyst at temperatures of from about 370 to 540 C 700 F to 1000 F , hydrogen pressures of from 100 to 500 p.s.i.g. 1 p.s.i.g. 6.895 kPa , LHSV values in the range of 0.1 to 10 and hydrogen to hydrocarbon molar ratios in the range of 1 to 20, preferably between 4 and 12. These same catalysts, i.e. those containing hydrogenation promoters, are also useful in hydroisomerizations processes in which feedstocks such as normal paraffins are converted to saturated branched chain isomers. Hydroisomerization is carried out at a temperature of from about 93.5 to 315 C 200 F to 600 F , preferably 150 to 288 C 300 F to 550 F with an LHSV value of from about 0.2 to 1.0. Hydrogen H is supplied to the reactor in admixture with the hydrocarbon Hc feedstock in molar proportions H Hc of between 1 and 5. At somewhat higher temperatures, i.e. from about 343 to 540 C 650 F to 1000 F , preferably 455 to 510 C 850 F to 950 F and usually at somewhat lower pressures within the range of about 15 to 50 p.s.i.g., the same catalyst compositions are used to hydroisomerize normal paraffins. Preferably the paraffin feedstock comprises normal paraffins having a carbon number range of C₇ C₂₀. Contact time between the feedstock and the catalyst is generally relatively short to avoid undesireable side reactions such as olefin polymerization and paraffin cracking. LHSV values in the range of 0.1 to 10, preferably 1.0 to 6.0 are suitable. The unique crystal structures of the present ELAPSO catalysts and their availability in a form having very low alkali metal content favor their use in the conversion of alkylaromatic compounds, particularly the catalytic disproportionation of toluene, ethylene, trimethyl benzenes, tetramethyl benzenes and the like. In the disproportionation process, isomerization and transalkylation can also occur. Group VIII noble metal adjuvants alone or in conjunction with Group VI B metals such as tungsten, molybdenum and chromium are preferably included in the catalyst composition in amounts of from about 3 to 15 weight of the overall composition. Extraneous hydrogen can, but need not, be present in the reaction zone which is maintained at a temperature of from about 204 to 399 C 400 to 750 F , pressures in the range of 100 to 2000 p.s.i.g. and LHSV values in the range of 0.1 to 15. Catalytic cracking processes are preferably carried out with ELAPSO compositions using feedstocks such as gas oils, heavy naphthas, deasphalted crude oil residua, etc., with gasoline being the principal desired product. Temperature conditions of 455 to 593 C 850 to 1100 F , LHSV values of 0.5 to 10 and pressure conditions of from about 0 to 50 p.s.i.g. are suitable. Dehydrocyclization reactions employing paraffinic hydrocarbon feedstocks, preferably normal paraffins having more than 6 carbon atoms, to form benzene, xylenes, toluene and the like are carried out using essentially the same reaction conditions as for catalytic cracking. For these reactions it is preferred to use the ELAPSO catalyst in conjunction with a Group VIII non noble metal cation such as cobalt and nickel. In catalytic dealkylation wherein it is desired to cleave paraffinic side chains from aromatic nuclei without substantially hydrogenating the ring structure, relatively high temperatures in the range of about 427 to 538 C 800 1000 F are employed at moderate hydrogen pressures of about 300 1000 p.s.i.g., other conditions being similar to those described above for catalytic hydrocracking. Preferred catalysts are of the same type described above in connection with catalytic dehydrocyclization. Particularly desirable dealkylation reactions contemplated herein include the conversion of methylnaphthalene to naphthalene and toluene and or xylenes to benzene. In catalytic hydrofining, the primary objective is to promote the selective hydrodecomposition of organic sulfur and or nitrogen compounds in the feed, without substantially affecting hydrocarbon molecules therein. For this purpose it is preferred to employ the same general conditions described above for catalytic hydrocracking, and catalysts of the same general nature described in connection with dehydrocyclization operations. Feedstocks include gasoline fractions, kerosenes, jet fuel fractions, diesel fractions, light and heavy gas oils, deasphalted crude oil residua and the like any of which may contain up to about 5 weight percent of sulfur and up to about 3 weight percent of nitrogen. Similar conditions can be employed to effect hydrofining, i.e., denitrogenation and desulfurization, of hydrocarbon feeds containing substantial proportions of organonitrogen and organosulfur compounds. It is generally recognized that the presence of substantial amounts of such constituents markedly inhibits the activity of hydrocracking catalysts. Consequently, it is necessary to operate at more extreme conditions when it is desired to obtain the same degree of hydrocracking conversion per pass on a relatively nitrogenous feed than are required with a feed containing less organonitrogen compounds. Consequently, the conditions under which denitrogenation, desulfurization and or hydrocracking can be most expeditiously accomplished in any given situation are necessarily determined in view of the characteristics of the feedstocks in particular the concentration of organonitrogen compounds in the feedstock. As a result of the effect of organonitrogen compounds on the hydrocracking activity of these compositions it is not at all unlikely that the conditions most suitable for denitrogenation of a given feedstock having a relatively high organonitrogen content with minimal hydrocracking, e.g., less than 20 volume percent of fresh feed per pass, might be the same as those preferred for hydrocracking another feedstock having a lower concentration of hydrocracking inhibiting constituents e.g., organonitrogen compounds. Consequently, it has become the practice in this art to establish the conditions under which a certain feed is to be contacted on the basis of preliminary screening tests with the specific catalyst and feedstock. Isomerization reactions are carried out under conditions similar to those described above for reforming, using somewhat more acidic catalysts. Olefins are preferably isomerized at temperatures of 260 to 482 C 500 900 F , while paraffins naphthenes and alkyl aromatics are isomerized at temperatures of 371 to 482 C 700 1000 F . Particularly desirable isomerization reactions contemplated herein include the conversion of n heptene and or n octane to isoheptanes, iso octanes, butane to iso butane, methylcyclopentane to cyclohexane, meta xylene and or ortho xylene to paraxylene, 1 butene to 2 butene and or isobutene, n hexene to isohexene, cyclohexene to methylcyclopentene etc. The preferred form of the catalyst is a combination of the ELAPSO with polyvalent metal compounds such as sulfides of metals of Group II A, Group II B and rare earth metals. For alkylation and dealkylation processes the ELAPSO compositions having pores of at least 5Å are preferred. When employed for dealkylation of alkyl aromatics, the temperature is usually at least 350 F and ranges up to a temperature at which substantial cracking of the feedstock or conversion products occurs, generally up to about 371 C 700 F . The temperature is preferably at least 232 C 450 F and not greater than the critical temperature of the compound undergoing dealkylation. Pressure conditions are applied to retain at least the aromatic feed in the liquid state. For alkylation the temperature can be as low as 121 C 250 F but is preferably at least 177 C 350 F . In the alkylation of benzene, toluene and xylene, the preferred alkylating agents are olefins such as ethylene and propylene.
