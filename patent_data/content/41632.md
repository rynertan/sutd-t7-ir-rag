# Turn signalling apparatus.

## Abstract
A vehicle turn signalling apparatus unambiguously sign als the direction of a turn by a simultaneous initiation of energization of a right turn indicator lamp 46 and a left turn lamp 46 one in a flashing mode of illumination to signal the turn direction, the other in a steady mode of illumination to provide a positional reference for the flashing lamp. Such provision permits close spacing of the turn indicator lamps from one another, and thus renders the apparatus particularly well suited for use on bicycles and mopeds.
