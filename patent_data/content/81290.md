# Fail safe circuit breaker.

## Abstract
A circuit breaker has a thermally responsive bimetallic member of substantial resistance properties disposed in the breaker circuit so that it self heats and moves to trip a mechanism to open the breaker circuit after a selected period of time when a selected overload current occurs in the circuit. Conductors are joined by a thermally separable bond and are disposed in the breaker circuit in selected heat transfer relation to the high resistance bimetallic member to be thermally separated after a selected delay period by heat transferred to the bond from the bimetallic means, thereby to open the circuit in the event that movement of the thermally responsive member is ineffective to open the circuit. Spring means preferably bias the conductors to separate to assure circuit opening when thermal separation of the noted bond occurs. Preferably one of the conductors has a part of reduced cross section adapted to rupture and open the circuit under alternate circuit conditions.
