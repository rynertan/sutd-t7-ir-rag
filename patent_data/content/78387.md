# Print head velocity control system with error count averaging.

## Abstract
In a control system for a bidirectional printer capable of printing at different speeds on different lines and in which processor means 28 compares the actual velocity of the print carriage with a desired velocity profile to generate an error count, the error count is measured and averaged out for each direction and speed of carriage movement to com pensate for the effect of changes in the printer system dynamics such as aging, wear, debris buildup, etc.
