# Vor antenna design.

## Abstract
A VOR antenna array with a plurality of radiating antenna elements 3 spaced around and arranged on the periphery of an essentially circular path. The elements extend in the same direction around the periphery of the circular path and a central feed point 1 is connected to the equivalent end of each radiating element by a feed line 2 to form a multi sectored loop fed at the junction of each sector by in phase sources.
