# Digital indication type speedometer.

## Abstract
A digital indication type speedometer comprising a speed counter 12 for counting speed pulses emitted in proportion to a vehicle speed for a given gate time, an indication register 14 for latching a value to be indicated 102 commensurate to an output from said speed counter and an indicator 16 for in dicating the value 103 latched in said indication register is of such an arrangement that a hysteresis processing circuit 18 is provided, which rewrites the value 103 latched in said indi cation register in accordance with an output of said speed counter only when a difference between the output 102 of said speed counter and the value 103 latched in said indica tion register is not within tolerance limit upon comparison therebetween, so that response of the indication is excellent during acceleration or deceleration, and no flickering is ob served during running at a constant speed.
