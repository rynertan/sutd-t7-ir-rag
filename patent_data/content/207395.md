# Four wheel drive anti locking braking.

## Abstract
A four wheel drive vehicle in which the brakes are indi vidually controlled to prevent locking. According to the inven tion, during anti locking brake, the torque transmitted be tween the front and rear wheels is reduced, either by discon necting the inter axle transmission or switching to a loosely coupled viscous coupling.
