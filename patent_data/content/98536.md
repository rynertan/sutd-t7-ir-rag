# WEAR RESISTANT SINTERED FERROUS ALLOY AND METHOD OF PRODUCING SAME

## Abstract
A highly wear resistant sintered ferrous alloy which con sists essentially of 2.0 8.0 of Cr, 0.1 1.0 of B, 1.0 2.5 of Si, 0.3 1.2 of Mn, 1.2 3.8 of C, by weight, and the balance of Fe. The alloy is produced by compacting and sintering a powder mixture, which is preferably prepared by mixing 75 90 parts by weight of a cast iron powder with 25 10 parts by weight of a Fe Cr B Si alloy powder.
