# Distributed feedback semiconductor laser.

## Abstract
The distributed feedback DFB semiconductor laser diode comprises an active layer 12 emitting light rays upon injection of an electric current and an optical waveguide 20 adjoining the active layer, for guiding the light rays together with the active layer 12 . The optical waveguide 20 comprises a first semiconductor layer 13 formed in the vicinity of the active layer 12 and having a greater bandgap than that of the active layer 12 , whose thickness varies in a corrugation of a prescribed cycle in the direction of the active layer 12 , and a second semiconductor layer 14 having a bandgap smaller than that of the first semiconductor layer 13 , but greater than that of the active layer 12 , and so formed as to confirm the corrugation of the first semiconduc tor layer 13 . First and second cladding layers adjoin the active layer 12 and the optical waveguide 20 , respectively, and have bandgaps greater than those of the active layer 12 and of the second semiconductor layer 14 . First and second electrodes inject an electric current into the active layer 12 in which a PN junction is formed by forward biasing. Light rays emitted from the active layer 12 interact with the diffraction grating formed by the boundary of the corruga tion to receive positive feedback, resulting in laser oscillation in a single longitudinal mode.
