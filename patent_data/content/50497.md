## Description
CATALYST COMPONENTS FOR POLYMERIZATION OF ALPHA OLEFINS AND PROCESSES FORTHEIR PREPARATION AND USE This invention relates to catalyst components for polymerization of alpha olefins and processes for their preparation and use, and particularly it relates to supported titanium catalyst components which can produce a polymer powder having a high bulk density at a high yield and a method for using them. Heretofore, where an olefin polymer, and especially polypropylene, is produced using a Ziegler Natta catalyst, many attempts have been made to obtain a catalyst having a high activity and exhibiting high stereoregularity, with the ultimate view of making the thus obtained polymer servicable as such a product without any further treatment. In recent years, supported catalysts based on titanium compounds supported on various supports, especially magnesium compounds, have been developed for the purpose of enhancing the polymerization capability per unit weight of titanium in a titanium component which is useful as a catalyst component, and accordingly good results are being achieved, but the ultimate catalyst has not yet been obtained. As regards supported catalysts utilizing a magnesium compound, especially magnesium chloride, as a support, in order to enhance the catalyst activity by increasing the active sites of the catalyst, many attempts have been made to pulverize the support into fine particles by mechanically grinding a mixture of magnesium chloride and other components. For example, there are known methods for preparing catalyst components, such as a method which comprises co grinding magnesium chloride and an aromatic carboxylic acid ester and subsequently treating by bringing the mixture into contact with titanium tetrachloride JapanesePatent Application Laid Open No. 126590 1975 , a method which comprises co grinding magnesium chloride and an aromatic carboxylic acid ester and subsequently treating by bringing the mixture into contact with a mixture of an addition reaction product of titanium tetrachloride and an acyl halide Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 17988 1979 , a method which comprises co grinding magnesium chloride and an acyl halide and subsequently treating by bringing the mixture into contact with a mixture of an addition reaction product of titanium tetrachloride and an ether Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 277 1978 , a method which comprises co grinding magnesium chloride and an organic acid ester, treating with an organic aluminum compound and subsequently treated by bringing the mixture into contact with titanium tetrachloride Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 160488 1979 , etc. However, since all these methods involve grinding a support, large amounts of fine powders having a wide particle size distribution and particle shape irregularity are obtained. When these catalysts are employed in the polymerization of alpha olefins, the polymer obtained contains undesriable amounts of fine powder, the polymer has a low bulk density and shows a wide particle size distribution. At the same time the catalyst activity cannot be said to be sufficiently high, catalyst activity rapidly deteriorates with the progress of polymerization such that it is difficult to improve the catalyst efficiency by the long term polymerization. More recently, there has been proposed a method to prepare a catalyst component by co grinding a co ground product of magnesium chloride and a carboxylic acid ester, a reaction product of an aluminum halide and a halogenated hydrocarbon, and titanium tetrachloride Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 158489 1979 . This method has a feature that, although employing the co grinding technique, by polymerization of an alpha olefin using the catalyst component obtained by this method, the formed polymer has particle properties such as high bulk density, etc.However, this method could hardly be considered advantageous from an industrial point of view because it is necessary to prepare a tacky material by the reaction of the aluminum halide and the halogenated hydrocarbon and handle it in one step of the preparation process of the catalyst and there is a possibility that coarse particles would be produced in large amounts by grinding. It is an object of the invention to provide a catalyst component for polymerization of alpha olefins which can produce a polymer having a high bulk density at a high yield and further which undergoes only slight deterioration of catalyst activity with the progress of polymerization and, hence, has an excellent effect to improve catalyst efficiency by long term polymerization. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a catalyst component which is formed by contacting a a magnesium halide, b an electron donating compound, c an aromatic carboxylic acid or a derivative thereof such as an anhydride or halide, d an organic aluminum compound, and e a titanium compound, and a method for polymerization alpha olefins which is characterized by homopolymerizing an alpha olefin or copolymerizing it with ethylene or another alpha olefin in the presence of a catalyst composed of the above catalyst component and an organic aluminum compound.
