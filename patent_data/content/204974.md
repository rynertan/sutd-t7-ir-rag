## Description
The present invention relates to a lubricant for thermoplastic resins according to the preamble of claim 1, and a thermoplastic resin composition comprising the lubricant. This thermoplastic resin composition has an excellent mold release characteristics at the molding step and can give a good gloss to a molded article. Since thermoplastic resins have good physical and chemical characteristics, they are widely used as films, sheets, wall materials, interior and exterior materials of automobiles, household electric appliances and the like. However, thermoplastic resins such as a vinyl chloride polymer resin, an ABS resin, a styrene polymer resin, and an acrylic resin have problems such that various processability characteristics are poor. As means for eliminating this defect, there has been adopted a method in which a thermal stabilizer, a processing aid such as a copolymer composed mainly of methyl methacrylate, a plasticizer, a mold release agent, a lubricant and the like are incorporated. However, this method cannot become a general solution of the problem. US A 4 145 380 discloses a three stage, sequentially produced graft polymer for use as vinyl halide impact modifier. In case the second stage includes the polymerization of an alkyl acrylat a crosslinking agent will be added during the second stage this results in said graft polymer becoming a crosslinked polymer. Chem. Abstr., Vol. 99,no. 123 567s 1983 describes a multilayer polymer bead for use as delustering agent for thermoplastics, which is prepared by sequentially adding to an emulsifier containing solution three monomer charges the second charge includes a crosslinking monomer. Therefore due to the use of a crosslinking monomer this prior art leads to a crosslinked polymer, too. By addition of said multi stage or multilayer polymers to thermoplastic resins there is provided a thermoplastic resin composition comprising said multi stage or multilayer polymers. The impact resistance of the endproducts obtained by the use of the said thermoplastic resin compositions may be improved, but at the same time the mold release characteristics are again becoming worse. In order to improve the productivity and quality, and from the energy saving viewpoint, it is desirable to develop a processing aid capable of giving a durable lubricating property to a vinyl chloride polymer resin at the processing step, and this desire is not sufficiently satisfied in the above mentioned compositions. Moreover, an increase of substances adhering to molds plateout is observed under some molding and processing conditions. Accordingly, the above mentioned compositions fail to sufficiently satisfy commercial requirements. A primary object of the present invention is to solve the above mentioned problem. Namely, the present invention is to provide a lubricant for thermoplastic resins, characterized in that the thermoplastic resin composition containing this lubricant has an excellent mold release characteristics at the molding step and gives good surface characteristics to a molded article. In accordance with the present invention, this object is achieved by a lubricant for thermoplastic resins according to the characterizing portion of claim 1 and a thermoplastic resin composition according to claim 2. As the thermoplastic resin for which the lubricant of the present invention is used, there can be mentioned a vinyl chloride polymer resin such as a polyvinyl chloride resin or a chlorinated vinyl chloride polymer resin , an ABS resin, a styrene polymer resin, a methacrylate polymer resin, and a polyethylene resin. The lubricant of the present invention is a polymer of a three layer structure, which is obtained by polymerizing the above mentioned monomer components A , B and C in sequence. A styrene polymer and a methacrylate polymer are arranged on the inner and outer sides, respectively, of the polymer of the component B imparting a lubricating property to a thermoplastic resin, and the lubricant has a so called sandwiched structure in which the kneading compatibility with a thermoplastic resin is improved. The component A is an aromatic vinyl homopolymer or an aromatic vinyl copolymer comprising up to 40 by weight of other vinyl monomer or monomers copolymerizable with an aromatic vinyl monomer. As the aromatic vinyl monomer, there may be used styrene, α methylstyrene and the like singly or in combination. The other vinyl monomer to be copolymerized with the aromatic vinyl monomer is not particularly critical, and an appropriate monomer is used according to the intended object. For example, there can be used vinyl cyanide compounds, vinyl esters, acrylic acid esters and methacrylic acid esters. These other monomers may be used singly or in the form of mixtures of two or more thereof. If the amount of the other monomer exceeds 40 by weight, the transparency is degraded and the long period durability of the lubricating property are drastically reduced. For the component A , polyfunctional monomers such as divinylbenzene and allyl methacrylate may be used in addition to the above mentioned monomers. Furthermore, a chain transfer agent such as n octylmercaptan may be used. The amount of the polyfunctional monomer or chain transfer agent used is preferably up to 2.0 by weight. The amount of the component A incorporated in the lubricant of the present invention is 10 to 60 parts by weight, preferably 20 to 50 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the sum of the components A , B and C . If the amount of the component A is larger than 60 parts by weight, the lubricating property is degraded, and if the amount of the component A is smaller than 10 parts by weight, the processability is reduced and the durability of the lubricating property is degraded. The component B is a homopolymer of an acrylic acid ester or a copolymer of an acrylic acid ester with up to 50 by weight of other vinyl monomer copolymerizable therewith. As the acrylic acid ester, there can be mentioned, for example, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, benzyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, cyclohexyl acrylate and phenyl acrylate. As the other copolymerizable monomer, there can be mentioned methacrylic acid esters, other acrylic acid esters, and aromatic vinyl monomers such as styrene and α methylstyrene. If the amount of the other copolymerizable vinyl monomer exceeds 50 by weight, the intended long period durability of the lubricating property is difficult to obtain. In order to impart a good lubricating effect to a thermoplastic resin, it is preferred that a monomer or monomer mixture giving a polymer having a low glass transition temperature be used as the component B . In order to further enhance the lubricating effect, it is preferred that the molecular weight be reduced by using a chain transfer agent such as n octylmercaptan. It is indispensable that the polymerization should be carried out so that when the component B is singly polymerized, the reduced viscosity of the obtained polymer is lower than 1.0 as measured at 25 C with respect to a solution of 0.1 g of the polymer in 100 ml of chloroform. More specifically, the polymerization is carried out by adjusting the amount of the chain transfer agent or catalyst used and the polymerization temperature. The amount of the component B incorporated in the lubricant is 30 to 70 parts by weight, preferably 35 to 70 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the sum of the components A , B and C . If the amount of the component B is smaller than 30 parts by weight, the lubricating property is degraded, and if the amount of the component B is larger than 70 parts by weight, the surface characteristics such as gloss are degraded. The component C is a polymer of a methacrylic acid ester. As the methacrylic acid ester, there can be mentioned methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate and butyl methacrylate, and methyl methacrylate is preferred. The reason is that methyl methacrylate is effective for improving the mixing kneadability with a thermoplastic resin and giving a good secondary processability to the thermoplastic resin. The amount of the component C incorporated in the lubricant is 5 to 30 parts by weight, preferably 5 to 25 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the sum of the components A , B and C . If the amount of the component C incorporated is smaller than 5 parts by weight, sufficient processability cannot be given to a thermoplastic resin, and secondary aggregation is easily caused at the steps of coagulating, dehydrating, and drying the polymer after polymerization of the component C and the productivity is degraded. If the amount incorporated of the component C is larger than 30 parts by weight, the long term durability of the lubricating property is lost. As pointed out hereinbefore, the lubricant of the present invention is a polymer having a three layer structure. This structure can be easily obtained by adding and polymerizing the monomers of the components A , B and C in sequence. As the polymerization method, there can be mentioned emulsion polymerization, suspension polymerization and bulk polymerization, and emulsion polymerization is especially preferred. In the emulsion polymerization method, in order to form a three layer structure, it is preferred that at the second and subsequent polymerization stages, the polymerization be advanced without addition of a fresh emulsifier, and formation of homopolymers of the components B and C be substantially controlled. Any known emulsifier may be used. For example, an ordinary surface active agent may be used. If the pH value of the polymerization mixture is turned to the alkaline side according to the kind of the emulsifier used, an appropriate pH adjusting agent may be used so as to prevent hydrolysis. As the pH adjusting agent, there may be used boric acid potassium chloride sodium hydroxide, potassium dihydrogenphosphate disodium hydrogenphosphate, boric acid potassium chloride sodium carbonate, boric acid sodium carbonate, potassium hydrogencitrate citric acid, potassium dihydrogenphosphate borax, and disodium hydrogenphosphate citric acid. Any water soluble and oil soluble single polymerization initiator and redox polymerization initiator may be used. For example, an ordinary water soluble inorganic initiator such as a persulfate is singly used, or a redox type initiator comprising a persulfate or the like and a sulfite, a hydrogensulfite or a thiosulfate is used. Moreover, a redox type initiator such as organic hydroperoxide sodium formaldehydesulfoxylate, or an azo compound may be used. As pointed out hereinbefore, in order to impart an excellent durability of the lubricating property to the lubricant of the present invention, it is important that the molecular weight of the polymer of the component B should be maintained at a very low level, that is, the reduced viscosity nsp C should be lower than 1.0, preferably 0.3 to 0.8. If the reduced viscosity is not lower than 1.0, the lubricating effect is degraded. Even if the reduced viscosity of the component C is not particularly controlled, the effects of the present invention are sufficiently attained. The reduced viscosity of the polymer may be adjusted according to customary procedures depending on such factors as the kind of chain transfer agent and the polymerization temperature. The thermoplastic resin composition of the present invention comprises 100 parts by weight of a thermoplastic resin and 0.05 to 10 parts by weight of the above mentioned lubricant. Mixing of the lubricant with the thermoplastic resin may be performed according to customary methods. For example, there may be adopted a method in which powders or pellets of the lubricant and thermoplastic resin are mixed by a melt extruder or a mixing roll, and a method in which a dispersion of the thermoplastic resin obtained by suspension polymerization or emulsion polymerization is mixed with a polymer latex of the lubricant obtained according to the present invention, and the mixture is subjected to acid precipitation or salt precipitation. According to need, various additives may be added to the thermoplastic resin composition of the present invention. For example, there may be used stabilizers such as organic tin compounds, metal soaps of the lead, barium and zinc types an epoxy compounds, lubricants such as stearic acid, ester wax, paraffin wax and stearyl alcohol, plasticizers such as phthalic acid esters, phosphoric acid esters, fatty acid esters and epoxy compounds, impact resistance improvers such as MBS and ABS, colorants such as carbon black and titanium oxide, fillers such as calcium carbonate and asbestos, inorganic blowing agents such as ammonia carbonate and sodium bicarbonate, and organic blowing agents such as nitro type blowing agents, sulfohydrazide blowing agents, and azo type blowing agents. The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the following examples and comparative examples. In these examples, all of parts are by weight.
