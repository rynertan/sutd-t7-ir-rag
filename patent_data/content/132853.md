## Description
Advanced composites are high strength, high modulus materials which are finding increasing use as structural components in aircraft, automotive, and sporting goods applications. Typically they comprise structural fibers such as carbon fibers in the form of woven cloth or continuous filaments embedded in a thermosetting resin matrix. Most advanced composites are fabricated from prepreg, a ready to mold sheet of reinforcement impregnated with uncured or partially cured resin. Resin systems containing an epoxide resin and aromatic amine hardener are often used in prepreg since they possess the balance of properties required for this composite fabrication process. State of the art epoxy carbon fiber composites have high compressive strengths, and good fatigue characteristics. and low shrinkage during cure. However, since most epoxy formulations used in prepreg are brittle, these composites have low toughness, which results in poor impact resistance and tensile properties which do not fully translate the properties of the reinforcing fiber. Thus there is a need for resin systems which afford composites with improved tensile and impact properties in combination with the compressive strengths typical of this class of materials. GB.A 1,182,377 describes a composition which contains a specific group of hardeners and polyepoxides having more than one epoxide group per molecule, if desired, in combination with additives, like glass fibres.

In one method of making impregnated tow or unidirectional tape the fiber is passed into a bath of the epoxy hardener mixture. A non reactive, volatile solvent such as methyl ethyl ketone may be optionally included in the resin bath to reduce viscosity. After impregnation, the reinforcement is passed through a die to remove excess resin, sandwiched between plies of release paper, passed through a set of heated rollers, cooled, and taken up on a spool. It is used within a few days or may be stored for months at 17,8 C. During prepreg manufacture, the resin system B stages , or partially advances. Composites may be prepared by curing preimpregnated reinforcement using heat and pressure. Vacuum bag autoclave cures work well with these compositions.

Typical cure temperatures are 37.8 C to 260 c, preferably 82 C to 232 C. The compositions of this invention are well suited for filament winding. In this composite fabrication process, continuous reinforcement in the form of tape or tow either previously impregnated with resin or impregnated during winding is placed over a rotating and removable form or mandrel in a previously determined pattern. Generally the shape is a surface of revolution and contains end closures. When the proper number of layers are applied, the wound form is cured in an oven or autoclave and the mandrel removed. Tacky drapable prepreg can be obtained with a wide variety of epoxy resins. Due to the low room temperature 25 C reactivity of the hardeners of this invention, long prepreg shelf lives can be obtained, typically one to three weeks.

Unreinforced castings were prepared from the formulations described in Example 1 to 14. Typical castings weighed 100 to 150 g and were made using the proportions given in the above examples. Casting dimensions were 3.2 x 177.8 x 101.6 to 152.4 mm. The general procedure for making castings was as follows The epoxy resin was charged to a three necked flask equipped with a paddle stirrer. The contents of the flask were heated to 100 C to 110 C and stirred as the amine hardener was added as a fine powder. The stirring was continued until the dissolution of the hardener. The homogeneous solution was poured into a 500 ml beaker and kept in an oven at 100 C to 110 C. The mixture was degassed in the oven for 15 to 30 minutes for removal of air bubbles. It was then poured into a glass mold with a cavity of dimensions 3.2 x 177.8 x 177.8 mm and was cured as follows 135 C for three hours and 179 C for two hours. Resin castings were tested to determine tensile properties and glass transition temperature. Tensile properties were measured according to ASTM D 638 using a Type 1 dogbone specimen. Glass transition temperature Tg was measured by DuPont 981 Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer at a heating rate of 5 C minute. The temperature corresponding to maximum peak point in the main damping transition was taken as Tg. Table I summarizes the properties of unreinforced castings. These materials have high tensile strengths, high moduli and high strains to failure compared to castings of many other epoxy formulations. Examples 29 through 31 and control A describe the preparation of unidirectional epoxy graphite prepreg. In all cases prepreg thickness per ply was approximately 127 152.4 µm All prepregs were made with a PAN based carbon fiber with a tensile strength of 45.5x 10² MPa and a tensile modulus of 234.6 x 10³ MPa. The resin formulation in Example 1 was prepared by adding the hardener to the epoxy resin over a 15 minute period while maintaining the mixture at 110 C. The reaction was further continued for 100 minutes at 110 C. The formulation was then cooled to 90 C and poured into a pan on a resin coater 76.2 mm wide 0.0254 mm thick film was coated at 90 C on a saturated flat release paper. A 71.12 mm wide ribbon of carbon fiber was passed through a heating chamber of the prepreg machine along with coated resin paper on top and bottom. The resin was melted on the fiber ribbon at 80 C to 85 C. The finished tape contained about 55 percent by weight of fiber. Unidirectional preimpregnated tape was prepared from the resin formulations in Examples 2 and 14. A control prepreg Control A was also made using a state of the art epoxy prepreg formulation. The thermal history of each formulation and the properties of the prepregs are summarized in Table II. Examples 32 and 33 describe the preparation of cured laminates and their properties. A unidirectional laminate was prepared by stacking eight plies of preimpregnated tape made in Example 29 in a mold, covering them with a Teflon impregnated spacer and bleeder cloths, and enclosing them in a nylon bag. The entire assembly was placed in an autoclave and cured. A laminate was also made from the control prepreg, and from the prepreg of Example 31 Example 33 . The laminates were tested to determine longitudinal tensile and compressive properties. Tensile properties were measured according to ASTM D3039. Compressive properties were measured using a modified ASTM D695 procedure. Unidirectional graphite epoxy tabs were added to prevent the sample ends from crushing in a noncompressive failure mode. A gauge length of approximately 4.83 mm was used. End tabs on compressive samples were adhered using FM 300 film adhesive from American Cyanamid Company, Havre de Grace, MD , which was cured at 177 C for one hour. Table III summarizes laminate properties. It is clear from this data that the prepreg composition of this invention affords composites with higher tensile and compressive properties than the Control. Examples 34 and 35 shown compressive strengths after impact of quasiisotropic laminates fabricated with the compositions of this invention. This test measures the damage tolerance of composites. The latter depends on the choice of matrix resin. All test specimens were made with PAN fiber prepregs and had dimensions of 152.4 mm x 101.6 mm x approximately 5.08 mm . They were impacted in the center with a Gardner type Impact Tester Gardner Laboratories, Bethesda, Maryland having a 15.87 mm diameter spherical indenter. The impact was normal to the plane of the fibers. When impacted, the laminate was simply supported over a 76.2 mm by 127 mm cutout in an aluminum plate with a plywood backup. After impact, it was tested for residual compressive strength in a steel fixture that constrained the edges of the sample from out of plane buckling. In this test, residual compressive strengths decrease as the impact load increases. The preferred samples have the highest residual compressive strengths at an impact level of 68.1 kg cm It is clear from Table IV that the residual compressive strengths of laminates made with the compositions of this invention are significantly higher than that of the control. Thus, the compositions of this invention have improved damage tolerance. The trade names in the description are regarded as Registered Trade Marks.
