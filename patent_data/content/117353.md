# Injection system.

## Abstract
An interactive injection system for use with a catheter 64 of the type adapted for insertion into a patient s vascular system for thermodilution measurements and the like in cludes a chamber 38 for storing liquid injectate, means 46 for connecting the chamber 38 to the catheter lumen 62 , and a drive for operating on the chamber to flow liquid injectate from the chamber into the lumen for discharge as a bolus from the lumen into the vascular system of a patient. In preferred embodiments, a temperature sensing probe 92 is connected between the injection chamber and the catheter for monitoring the temperature of injectate as it is introduced into the catheter. Cooperating controller ap paratus 10 includes means 28, 30 for operating the drive, operator controlled inputs 14 for selecting injectate rate and volume parameters, another operator controlled input 44 for enabling the injector drive, an input from a sensor 84 adapted to be located in the patient s vascular system downstream from the proximal port 82 and operative during an injection cycle in response to a sensed deviation of output e.g., out of specification for terminating the injec tion sequence, and a processor for utilizing e.g., integrat ing the sensor output 12 to generate a cardiac output value or similar data.
