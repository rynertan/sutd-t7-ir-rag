## Description
This invention relates to an improved method for preparing conjugates of tracemetal containing metallothionein and biologically active molecules. Use of radiolabeled target seeking biologically active molecules hereinafter referred to as BAMs , especially antibodies and other proteins, for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes is a highly active field. For a discussion of such radiolabeling, see Eckelman For these reasons, it has been proposed by many in the art to radiolabel BAMs with metallic radionuclides by covalent conjugation using a metal chelating agent. For example, Khaw Further, current intravascular radiographic contrast agents are based upon iodinated aromatic compounds. These compounds, however, are often found not to be physiologically tolerable at useful concentrations. Therefore, it would be desirable to develop physiologically compatible alternatives to such iodinated compounds. Also, in the rapidly developing field of nuclear magnetic resonance NMR imaging, useful contrast agents would be valuable, particularly if capable of conjugation with BAMs. Brasch Commonly assigned U.S.S.N. 539,733 filed October 6, 1983 in the name of Tolman hereby incorporated by reference discloses various processes for preparing conjugates of trace labeled metallothionein and biologically active molecules BAMs . Although the processes described therein result in useful trace labeled conjugates, the yields of those conjugates are somewhat low. There remains, therefore, a need for a process for conjugation of trace labeled metallothionein to BAMs. The instant invention is an improved process for producing tracer labeled conjugates of metallothionein and BAMs comprising the sequential steps of i conjugating the BAM to a heterobifunctional crosslinking agent and ii either a conjugating the product of i with metallothionein where at least a portion of the metal therein is a tracer metal, or b conjugating the product of i with metallothionein where all of the metal therein is non tracer and subsequently exchange labeling at least a portion of the non tracer metal with tracer metal. Metallothioneins are described in Generally speaking, metallothioneins are low molecular weight proteins which are produced All mammalian thioneins contain 60 61 amino acid residues and can bind 7 gram atoms of divalent or up to 20 gram atoms of monovalent metal ion per mole. Thioneins generally contain no aromatic or histidine residues, and 20 of the amino acid residues in mammalian thioneins are cysteines. Based on spectroscopic evidence, metal ligation by thionein is almost exclusively through the sulfhydryl moieties of the cysteines. Complete amino acid sequences for several metallothioneins have been determined they are reported on page 60 of Kagi and Nordberg and selected ones are repeated here One letter symbols Other symbols Metal binding fragments of thionein, for example, as reported in Yoshida et al., Of course, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that polypeptides having functional similarities to metallothionein, as well as copolymers of metallothionein metallothionein fragments and conventional monomers, made using conventional synthetic techniques, are useful in the practice of the subject invention so long as they exhibit the general characteristics of metallothionein as detailed above. Of the diagnostic and therapeutic radionuclides heretofore known, the following are those useful in the practice of the subject invention half life given in d days, h hours The diagnostic radionuclides are gamma emitters and or positron emitters, emitting energies between 30KeV and 1MeV and possessing half lives of between about 1 minute and 8 days. These radionuclides are useful in conjunction with conventional radioscintigraphic imaging techniques based upon, e.g.. planar, single photon or positron tomographic methods. The therapeutic radionuclides emit alpha , beta , gamma, conversion electrons or Auger electrons of energies between 100eV and 2MeV, and are capable of killing cells Of course, those skilled in the art will appreciate that when discussing diagnostic and therapeutic uses for these various radionuclides, the dosages utilized will depend upon many variables. When utilizing the radionuclides for imaging purposes, the particular dosage employed need only be high enough to obtain diagnostically useful images, generally in the range of 0.1 to 20 mCi 70 Kg body weight. In contrast, for therapeutic purposes, higher doses can be utilized, generally in the range of 0.1 500 mCi 70 Kg body weight. Of course, the proper dose will ultimately depend on the physical properties of radionuclide such as half life, type of radiation, and energy of radiation, and on the pharmacokinetics of the radiolabeled agent. Of the contrast agents heretofore known as being useful for NMR imaging, cobalt, nickel, copper and ruthenium are considered useful in the practice of the subject invention. Of the contrast agents heretofore known as being useful for radiographic imaging, metallic elements in the periodic table numbered 72 to 83 are considered useful in the practice of the subject invention, and bismuth, lead, mercury, gold, platinum, rhenium and tungsten are preferred. The term target seeking biologically active molecules BAM as used herein means antibodies especially monoclonal antibodies , Fab, Fab and F ab ₂ fragment of antibodies, and other molecules which localize in certain organs, tissues or cells of the mammalian body. Examples of such other molecules are hormones such as insulin, glucagon, prostaglandins, steroidal hormones, and peptides, and other proteins which bind specifically to certain cell types, such as lutenizing hormone which binds to receptors in ovaries. Large molecules such as proteins are generally preferred for radiolabeling through metallothionein conjugation, but conjugation of several small molecules may also be suitable for example, conjugation to radiolabeled metallothionein of several molecules of quinuclidinyl benzilate, which binds to muscarinic cholinergic receptors of the heart, would provide a radiopharmaceutical for following the viability of the heart cells The improved process of instant invention utilizes crosslinking agents through which BAMs are conjugated to metallothionein. These crosslinking agents are heterobifunctional in nature, i.e. the reactive group used for conjugating the BAM is functionally distinct from the reactive group used for conjugating metallothionein. More specifically, the reactive group of the crosslinking agent to be reacted with metallothionein need be one capable of reaction with the thiol SH group of the metallothionein, while the reactive group of the crosslinking agent to be reacted with the BAM must not be capable of reaction with a thiol group, but must be capable of reaction with another functional group on the BAM. If the BAM is a monoclonal antibody or other glycoprotein, available functional groups will be NH₂, OH, CO₂H, and NHC NH NH₂. When dealing with smaller drugs or hormones that do not contain such groups, one of these groups may be synthetically incorporated into the small molecule so that conjugation with metallothionein can take place. Methodology will vary widely from one such drug or hormone to another, as is well known to those skilled in the art, a prime consideration being the preservation of biological specificity and affinity. For a general discussion of such synthetic modification, see Means and Feeney, Chemical Modification of Proteins, Holden Day, Inc. 1971 hereby incorporated by reference. Further, the process of this invention requires the BAM to be conjugated to the crosslinking agent Therefore, the conjugation of BAMs to metallothionein through heterobifunctional crosslinking agents can be represented by the following general formula The preferred moieties for X in forming covalent bonds with NHC NH NH₂ groups include 1,2 and 1,3 dicarbonyl compounds like malondialdehyde, cyclohexane 1,2 dione, and camphorquinone. The reaction of arginine residues with these reagents is very selective and is reversable. The preferred moiety for X in utilizing carboxy groups of BAMs for crosslinking is the amine group. When activated by a water soluble carbodiimide such as 1 cyclohexyl 3 2 morpholinyl 4 ethyl carbodiimide or 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethyl aminopropyl carbodiimide , the activated carboxyl group of BAMs will react with X NH₂ of a crosslinking agent to form a amide bond. Some commercially available crosslinking agents useful in the instant invention include succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC , succinimidyl 4 iodoacetyl aminobenzoate SIAB , and succinimidyl 4 p maleimidophenyl butyrate. In general, the choice of chain length between X and Y varies depending on the nature of the BAM being attached. With large BAMs, a longer chain may be required to allow optimal covalent bond formation between the crosslinking agent bound to metallothionein and the target functional groups on the large protein. With small BAMs, a very long carbon chain may be required to allow for the BAM attached to metallothionein to interact with its cell surface receptor. The chain length can thus be varied either to optimize the crosslinking process or to maximize the retention of biological activity of the metallothionein BAM conjugate. In general, for the conjugation of proteins to metallothionein, mild conditions are required to avoid denaturation of the metallothionein and BAM and loss of biological activity. The pH of the reaction should be in the range of about 3 to 11, preferably 5 to 9, temperature in the range of 0 to 60 C, and concentrations of each BAM and metallothionein in the range of 10 ² to 10 ⁶ For purposes of the subject invention, the metallothionein introduced into the reaction scheme above can be cold i.e. not contain any tracer metal or can be pre trace labeled i.e. can have all or a portion of the metal binding sites of metallothionein occupied by tracer metal . In the situation where trace labeled metallothionein is to be utilized in the reaction scheme above, there are generally two procedures which can be utilized to produce trace labeled metallothionein. The first is by direct labeling of thionein. The second is by exchange labeling a metallothionein such as Zn metallothionein using a desirable metal trace label. The first procedure, i.e., the direct labeling of thionein with trace label, is similar to that reported by M. Vasak and J. Kagi, When utilizing a radionuclide as the metal trace label, the concentration of radionuclide added depends on the specific activity required for the clinical application of interest. For diagnostic applications, the ratio of moles of radionuclide per mole of thionein may be as small as one or less. For therapeutic applications, this ratio may be higher. Non radioactive metal cations may be added in quantities sufficient to occupy the metal binding sites not occupied by radioactive cations. Following the addition of radionuclides, and optionally non radioactive metal cation, the resulting solution may be degassed to remove oxygen and neutralized in an inert atmosphere until the pH is greater than 7.0. During this neutralization the thionein folds around the radionuclide and non radioactive metal cations to form the desired radiolabeled metallothionein. The labeled metallothionein can then be purified by conventional techniques such as dialysis, size exclusion or ion exchange chromatography. The non radioactive metal content of the radiolabeled metallothionein can be determined by atomic absorption and the radionuclide content assessed by counting radioactive decay. This purified radionuclide labeled metallothionein can then be coupled directly to a BAM using crosslinking agents described above. The second labeling procedure involves the exchange of a trace label metal cation for all or a portion of the non trace label metal cations of metallothionein. The success of this exchange reaction requires that the trace label cation have a higher affinity for the mercaptides of metallothionein than the non trace label cation in the preformed metallothionein. For example, when utilizing radionuclides as the metal trace label, zinc cations have a lower affinity for the mercaptides of metallothionein than cations of either technetium, mercury, or silver. Therefore, in the presence of cations of technetium 99m, mercury 197, or silver 111, the Zn II cations of Zn metallothionein MTh are readily displaced to give Alternatively, cold metallothionein can be utilized in the process of the instant invention and exchange labeled after formation of the BAM metallothionein conjugate. This exchange labeling is carried out as described above. The use of this exchange labeling procedure is useful especially when utilizing radionuclides with half lives shorter than 24 hours because this exchange labeling can be carried out at the clinical site. As further discussed below, exchange labeling of a Zn MTh BAM conjugate with short lived radionuclides makes possible the introduction of radionuclides immediately before use and avoids the inevitable loss of radioactivity through decay. Of the radionuclides mentioned above, Methods analogous to those described for radiolabeling metallothionein may be used for incorporation of non radioactive metallic trace labels. Of those which would be useful for radiographic contrast, i.e., Bi, Rh, Hg, Au, Pt, Re and W, mercury and gold can be incorporated into metallothionein by exchange labeling or by direct conjugation to the apoprotein. Incorporation of the remaining elements is achieved by direct labeling. Of those which would be useful for NMR imaging, i.e., Co, Hi, Cu II and Ru, copper II and ruthenium is best incorporated into metallothionein by exchange labelling, whereas cobalt and nickel are incorporated by direct labeling. The trace labeled conjugates of this invention are used in the same manner as prior art trace labeled BAMs. They can be lyophilized for storage and shipment then reconstituted in pharmacologically acceptable media, such as normal physiological saline and injected intravenously for diagnostic imaging or therapy, or they can be prepared immediately before use by exchange labeling. They can also be used in
