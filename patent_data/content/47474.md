## Description
This invention relates to a process for converting alkylene carbonates to their corresponding epoxides.More particularly, this invention is concerned with a process for generating an alkylene carbonate such as ethylene oxide from the corresponding alkylene carbonate with a minimum formation of undesired aldehyde and or ketone byproducts. Processes for the efficient conversion of alkylene carbonates, particularly ethylene and propylene carbonates, to the corresponding epoxides namely, ethylene oxide and propylene oxide have heretofore been the focus of relatively limited study in the prior art.Processes to synthesize the alkylene carbonate starting material from an alkylene oxide and carbon dioxide are more common in the art and are amply described in the patent literature. U. S. Patent Nos. 2,773,070 2,873,282 2,907,771 and 2,994,704 are descriptive of such carbonate forming process. Belgian patent No.872,960 corresponding to U. S. Patent application SerialNo. 863,354, filed December 22, 1977, assigned toUnion Carbide Corporation is directed to a particularly efficient process for alkylene carbonate formation which is characterized by alkylene carbonate efficiencies above 99 and an epoxide conversion of greater than 99.5 . In view of the relatively advanced state of the art of alkylene carbonate formation as reflected by the patents disclosed above, a process which efficiently converts an alkylene carbonate, such as ethylene carbonate, to ethylene oxide could be advantageously combined with an efficient alkylene carbonate forming process so as to allow ethylene carbonate to be used as an economical, safe and non explosive medium of transportation for ethylene oxide.The ethylene oxide could thus be efficiently generated from ethylene carbonate upon demand and thereby avoid the inherent hazards of shipping and storing the flammable oxide prior to use. Moreover, in instances where the reactant alkylene carbonate is produced from non epoxide starting materials, such carbonate would represent a particularly desirable source for generating alkylene oxide. A major source of inefficiency in the conversion of an alkylene carbonate to an alkylene oxide and carbon dioxide is the formation of aldehydes andlor ketones as byproducts of the reaction. For processes where the alkylene carbonate reactant is, for example, ethylene carbonate, acetaldehyde is generally formed as an undesired byproduct. Similarly, the conversion of propylene carbonate usually results in the undesired formation of propionaldehyde and or acetone the particular aldehyde and or ketone thus produced being dependent upon the choice of alkylene carbonate reactant. The presence of such aldehyde and ketone byproducts is deemed unacceptable in commercial grade alkylene oxides because they adversely affect the products ultimately formed by the catalyzed reactions of such alkylene oxides.Moreover, the separation of such aldehydes and ketones from alkylene oxide is troublesome and costly. For example, the separation of acetaldehyde from ethylene oxide is a relatively difficult operation inasmuch as both materials are liquids having relatively similar volatilities. As a consequence, separation is usually effected in commercial operation by a relatively elaborate fractional distillation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention describes a homogeneous process for converting an alkylene carbonate to the corresponding epoxide wherein a liquid phase containing the alkylene carbonate and a catalyst is heated to form a product mixture comprising predominantly alkylene oxide and carbon dioxide.The process is characterized by the improvement wherein a stream of inert gas is continuously introduced into the liquid phase so as to remove from said liquid phase at least a portion of the product epoxide formed by the process. The present invention is predicated on the discovery that the continuous sparging of the homogeneous liquid phase with a stream of inert gas substantially reduces the formation of undesired aldehyde and or ketone byproducts. Although the mechanism by which such undesired byproduct formation is reduced is not fully understood, it is believed that by continuously removing alkylene oxide from the liquid phase with a stream of inert gas and thereby minimizing its residence time in the liquid phase, the availability of such alkylene oxide to interact with alkylene carbonate and the homogeneous catalyst is correspondingly reduced thereby preventing the undesired side reactions which result in the formation of aldehyde and ketone byproducts. The term inert gas as used throughout the specification and claims refers to any gas which when introduced into the liquid phase described herein does not react to form products other than alkylene carbonate, alkylene oxide or carbon dioxide. Thus, for example, oxygen is not considered an inert gas for purposes of the invention because it reacts with the alkylene carbonate to form additional byproducts. Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, while it may affect the kinetics of the con version reaction of alkylene carbonate to epoxide, does not react in the liquid phase to form products other than alkylene carbonate or alkylene oxide. Accordingly, the inert gases contemplated by the invention are most conveniently nitrogen, helium and carbon dioxide. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The preferred alkylene carbonates contemplated by the invention are ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate, such carbonates being reacted by the process of the invention to produce ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. xespectively. Other alkylene carbonates may, however, be also advantageously used in accordance with the invention to produce the corresponding epoxide. the invention contemplates the utilization of known catalysts for the conversion of alkylene carbonate to alkylene oxide. Thus, the catalyst may be any of those which are specifically defined by the prior art. For example, U. S. Patent No. 4,069,234 describes the use of phosphonium halide catalysts for the formation of vicinal epoxides from carbonates. Alkali metal halides, such as described in Shapiro et al., J Org. Chem. U.S.S.R., 5 2 , p. 222 1969 , are generally preferred for the reaction. The catalysts may be employed in amounts ranging from as little as 0.001 moles liter.in the liquid phase, based on the alkylene carbonate reactant, to about 0.1 mole liter. Generally a concentration of from about 0.01 to 0.05 mole liter is desirable. The primarymaterials contained in the hamogeneous liquid phase in the conversion of alkylene carbonate to alkylene oxide is the alkylene carbonate readtan and a catalyst. A solvent is generally not necessary but if desired, an inert solvent such as tetraglyme or tetralir may be added to the liquid phase. This is particularly desirable in a continuous reaction system as a means of maintaining the catalyst in solution during catalyst recycl The inert gas stream is desirably passed through the liquid body in a manner so as to achieve a high degree of gas dispersion throughout the liquid mixture and thereby maximize the amount of product alkylene glycol removed by the gas stream. A variety of gas distribution techniques may. be employed.For example, the gas stream may be introduced through a sparger into the liquid phase mixture containing the product alkylene glycol. The sparger may be in the form of a ring having a multiplicity of orifices at the bottom of the vessel which contains the liquid mixture or more simply, a tube having a fritted disc at its end. Stirring means may be provided within the vessel to insure good distribution of the gas through the liquid phase. Similarly, a baffle type arrangement may be used to direct the gas flow as it rises from the bottom of the liquid phase to tne top. The process temperature of the reaction is generally maintained between 100 C and 250 C. The minimum temperature of the reaction is that temperature at which the catalytic decomposition of alkylene carbonate to alkylene oxide and carbon dioxide will occur.At temperatures below 100C the rate of reaction of such carbonate decomposition is generally too low for practical consideration. Temperatures above 2500C are generally avoided so as to minimize the rate of reaction to undesired aldehyde and or ketone byproducts.For most effective operation of the process, a temperature range of from about 1700C to about 2200C is preferred. The process of the invention is conveniently carried out at atmospheric pressure. However, operation of the process at sub atmospheric pressure is particularly desirable for purposes of reducing aldehyde and or ketone byproduct, such process operation being more fully described in cop enduing application Serial No.filed on even date herewith D 12,530 .DESCRIPTION OF TEST PROCEDURE The test reactor used in the following examples was a 75 ml carius tube sealed at the top with a metal cap fitted with a gas purge tube having a fritted disc at its base for introducing a gas stream into the liquid phase and having ports for adding catalyst and alkylene carbonate to the reactor and sampling the effluent gas produced by the reaction. The test reactor was immersed in an oil bath to maintain a constant reaction temperature. The reactor was used in a continuous mode in which liquid alkylene carbonate was fed at a rate sufficient to maintain a constant liquid level.The effluent vapors leaving the reactor were passed into a 316 stainless steel manifold prior to being sampled and analyzed for ethylene oxide and acetaldehyde in a Perkin Elmer model 990 gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector. The effluent or off gas of the reactor was discharged from the manifold through a flowmeter. Doubly distilled ethylene carbonate was distilled from calcium hydride prior to its use in the examples below. A fraction having a boiling point of from 128 129 C 124mm was collected. The ethylene carbonate thus recovered was weighed and introduced into the reactor which was maintained at the indicated reaction temperature by the oil bath. Referring to Table I, Example 1 was a control example in which a large amount of acetaldehyde 8400 ppm byproduct was formed. In Examples 2 and 3, the use of an inert gas sparge of helium and carbonldioxide, respectively, under near identical reaction conditions relative to Example 1 resulted in a greater than 70 reduction in acetaldehyde formation specifically, the formation of 2600 and 2000 ppm, respectively. The effect of minimized aldehyde formation attendant to an inert gas sparge of the liquid phase was also noted in Examples 4 and 5 which used different catalysts than that used in Example 1, Example 5 being also operated at a higher temperature than Example 1.
