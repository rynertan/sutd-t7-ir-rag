# MFB system with a by pass network.

## Abstract
A device for driving an electroacoustic transducer 1 comprising a feedback amplifier device and a pickup 2 whose output signal is a measure of the acoustic output signal of the transducer 1 and which serves as a feedback signal, is equipped with a by pass network 4 which bypasses at least the electroacoustic transducer 1 and the pickup 2 , the out put signal of the by pass network 4 for frequencies outside the operating range of the electroacoustic transducer being large and for frequencies in the operating range f The sum of the output signals of the pickup and the by pass network serves as the feedback signal. This results in a device having a larger frequency range for the transducer and having a substantially smaller distortion. If desired, the device may also be equipped with a net work 5 included before the electroacoustic transducer, which network has a frequency response which is the inverse of that of the signal path from the electroacoustic transducer to the pickup, and a limiter 11 . These steps yield an addi tional reduction of the distortion.
