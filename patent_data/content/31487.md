# Facsimile apparatus and method for restarting a facsimile machine.

## Abstract
Restarting a facsimile operation after a mid page in terrupt is accomplished in a facsimile system that does not necessarily have a one to one synchronous relationship between synchronized mechanisms in the system. A print carriage is synchronized to a false once around signal related to the motion of a print drum. If a mid page inter rupt occurs, the line position at the time of interrupt is remembered, and the particular relationship existing be tween the false once around and the real once around is remembered. The carriage is backed up to a point prior to the mid page interrupt and rests until restart. Upon restart, the carrriage is accelerated up to speed and resynchronized to the false one around before it reaches the point of interrupt. When the carriage reaches the interrupt point, that position is detected, and the facsimile system resumes printing on the next line without splitting or overlapping the image.
