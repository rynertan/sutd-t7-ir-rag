Owing to these difficulties, these substances have not yet a practical significance.Disclosure of the Invention The present inventors have found that, when human myelogenic leukemia cells are cultured in a protein free medium, the culture supernatant contains substances which remarkably promote uptake of 3H thymidine into cells and promote DNA synthesis in an uptake test system using mouse fibroblast strain 3T3 and chick embryo fibroblast, and have established the present invention. The present invention is described in detail below. The present invention provides novel physiologically active proteinaceous substances having an activity of promoting DNA synthesis. The substances of the present invention can be classified into two groups, i.e., the one having a molecular weight of 6,300 500 and the one having a molecular weight of 9,000 13,000, and can be further classified into the following species according to isoelectric points. Table 1 No. Molecular weight Isoelectric point pI 1 9,200 500 8.55 0.1 2 10,000 500 6.9 0.1 3 9,400 500 8.25 0.1 4 10,000 t 500 6.7 0.1 I 5 10,500 t 500 5.8 0.1 6 10,500 500 5.6 t 0.1 7 10,500 t 500 6.09 0.1 8 11,000 1 500 4.7 t 0.1 9 11,800 500 4.19 t 0.1 10 12,800 500 3.54 t 0.1 11 6,300 500 8.0 0.1 12 n 8.4 t 0.1 II 13 n 8.5 0.1 14 N 9.0 1 0.3 15 n 9.6 0.3 The substances of the present invention are not decomposed by deoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease and neuraminidase, and are inactivated by proteinase such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, etc. Thus, they can be regarded as proteinaceous or peptidic substances. The substances of the present invention have an activity of promoting uptake of 3H thymidine into chick embryo fibroblasts and mouse fibroblast strain 3T3 and promoting DNA synthesis. Furthermore, the substances of the present invention also promote propagation of mouse fibroblast strain 3T3. Molecular weights and isoelectric points of said well known active substances are given below for comparison.

The substances of the present invention are formed and accumulated mainly in a culture supernatant by culturing human myelogenic leukemia cells in a medium, and thus can be recovered therefrom. Any of human myelogenic leukemia cells can be used so long as they can produce the substances of the present invention, and K562 Tl strain can be mentioned as a suitable strain. The K562 T1 strain consists of cells habituated to a protein free medium, which are obtained by culturing K562 strain in Ham F10 medium initially containing 10 fetal calf serum while lowering the serum concentration successively for a habituation period of about one year. The K562 strain is a well known cell strain disclosed in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.,USA., 76, 1293 1979 , Blood, 45, 321 1975 , GANN 73, 97 1982 , etc. and is generally available. As the medium, protein free media such as Ham F10 medium and Ham F12 medium products of Flow Laboratory,Inc. , Dulbecco MEM medium, MEM medium and RPMI 1640 medium products of Nissui Seiyaku Co., Ltd. , etc., and their mixed media can be employed. Appropriate amounts of glutamine 0.5 5 mM mi , antibiotics penicillin 25 U mL , streptomycin 25 pg mi , etc. , sodium bicarbonate 0.01 , etc. may be added to the medium if necessary. For the culturing, various culturing bottles, Petri dishes, roller bottles, spinner flasks, jar fermenters, etc.can be employed. Culturing is usually carried out at a seed cell density of 5 x 104 1 x 106 cells mQ and 30 400C for 2 4 hours whereby the substances of the present invention are formed mainly in a culture broth according to the respective cell density. For example, by culturing at the seed cell density of 1 x 105 cells mQ and 370C for 2 days, 300 unit ml active substance is formed in the culture broth. The substances of the present invention are recovered from the culture broth in the following manner.That is, the supernatant of the resulting culture broth is concentrated by freeze drying, ultrafiltration, strongly acidic ion exchange resin, etc. Elution is carried out with a weakly basic buffer or an alkali solution of low concentration. Furthermore, low molecular substances of medium origin are removed by gel filtration. As the gel filtering agent, Sephadex made by Pharmacia Fine Chemicals,Inc. , Biogel made by Bio Rad Laboratories, Inc. , ControlPore Glass made by Corning Glass Works, Inc. , Toyopearl made by Toyo Soda Co., Ltd. , etc. can be employed. Since the substances of the present invention have a high molecular weight, many low molecular substances having an influence upon the biological activity assays can be removed by restricting the molecular weight fractionating range to 1,000 5,000. By this operation, the active fractions can be fractionated substantially at the void volume position. The recovery of the active fractions is about 80 , and when only the measurement value at 280 nm is calculated and converted to the absorption at 280 nm of bovine albumin among the three wavelength measurements at 280 nm, 260 nm and 340 nm, the specific activity is increased about 200 fold.These active fractions are joined together and concentrated by freeze drying. Then, the active fractions are fractionated according to molecular weights. The active fractions in an amount of 1 100 of the gel amount are passed through a column of biogel or Sephadex, and then elution is carried out with 0.05M phosphate buffer as an eluting solution at a flow rate of 0.1 in S.V. The active fractions are separated according to the respective molecular weights, and fractionated into three groups. The groups are designated as Fractions I, II and III in the order of molecular weight, I being the highest, and the ratio of I III becomes 7 4 3. The entire activity recovery shows a substantial quantitative recovery in this step and the specific activity is increased 720 fold. For isoelectric point fractionation, these active fractions are desalted with strongly basic ion exchange resin such as Dowex 50W x 8 made by Dow Chemical Co., Inc. ,Amberlite IR 120 made by Bio Rad Laboratory, Inc. , SK102 made by Mitsubishi Kasei Kogyo Co., Ltd. , SP Sephadex C 25 made by Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Inc. , etc. After adsorption at pH 3 7, the column is washed with distilled water and eluted with 0 0.3N aqueous ammonia. The recovery in this step is 30 50 , and the activity ratio of the fractions is I II III 7 2 3. Isoelectric point electrophoresis is carried out at 900V and 10 mA for 48 hours in a column with 100 mQ of LKB8100 made by LKB, Sweden at an ampholite concentration of 1.9 0.6258 and at a pH gradient of 3 10 while cooling to 40C. After the completion of electrophoresis, fractionation is carried out using a fraction collector, and pH and activity of the respective fractions are measured. In this step, 5 species of active fractions shown in the said group I can be obtained from Fraction I, and 6 species of active fractions shown in the said group II can be obtained from Fraction II, while no characteristic active species are obtained from Fraction III. The ampholites are removed from the respective fractions through a PD 10 column G 25 column made by Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Inc. . In this step, the recovery is 0.5 2 as the ultimate recovery, and the specific activity is increased 3,600 to 14,400 fold. Procedures for determining biological activities of the present invention are described below. 1.

As the medium,Ham F10 medium protein free medium containing glutamine 4 mM , penicillin 25 U mA , streptomycin 25 pg mQ , and sodium bicarbonate 0.01 was used. The recovered cell supernatant 3,000 mQ was subjected to centrifugation 6,000 rpm for 10 minutes , and the supernatant 3,000 m was freeze dried. Dried powder about 30g was dissolved in distilled water 43 mi to make the concentration 70 times that of the cell supernatant. The solution was subjected to gel filtration with Biogel P 6 made by Bio Rad Laboratory,Inc. . The amount of the sample was 1 20 W V of the gel amount, and elution was carried out with 0.05M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 at a flow rate of 0.1 in S.V. The eluate was recovered in 10 mQ fractions. Elution pattern is shown in Fig. 1. Low molecular substances were substantially completely removed, and an activity of promoting the uptake of 3H thymidine appeared around the void volume V0 . The active fractions had also an effect of promoting the propagation of mouse 3T3 L1 cells, and thereby the number of cells propagated became 2.3 times as many as that in the case where no sample was added. The recovery was 80 , and the specific activity was increased 210 fold, when the absorption at 280 nm was used to obtain the protein content in terms of bovine albumin amount among three wavelength absorbances at 260 nm, 280 nm and 340 nm, using Shimadzu Spectrophotometer Us240. 2 Then, 60 m of the said active fractions was collected, freeze dried, and further fractionated likewise with Biogel P 60 made by Bio Rad Laboratory, Inc. . That is, 140 mg of the sample was dissolved in 4 mQ of distilled water, and the solution was passed through a 100 mQ column packed with Biogel P 60. Elution was carried out with 0.05M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 at a flow rate of 0.1 in S.V. The eluate was recovered in 3 mb fractions. Elution pattern is shown in Fig. 2. Active fractions were separated into three groups, and can be separated from high molecular impurities aroundVO. The three active groups were substantially quantitatively eluted together, and the specific activity was increased 720 fold. The groups were designated as I, II andIII, respectively, in the order of molecular weight, I being the highest, and the activity ratio of these active fractions was 7 4 3, while their specific activities were substantially equal to one another. 3 The active fractions I, II and III, 24 mi, 12 mi and 12 mL, respectively were passed through a column packed with 1 mQ of a strongly acidic ion exchange resin, Dowex 50W x 8 Na form, made by Dow Chemical Co. , and the column was washed with 15 mQ of distilled water. Elution was carried out with 25 mQ of distilled water and 25 mQ of a 3N aqueous ammonia according to the linear concentration gradient method. By this operation, salts were substantially completely removed. After the elution, the active fractions were freed from ammonia by freeze drying. I II IIIRecovery 20 9 14 Specific activity 3,600 14,400 5,000 4 Isoelectric points of the above fractions were determined using an 8100 1 column made by LKB with 1.9 0.625 of ampholite at pE 3 10. As an anolyte at the bottom of 110 mi column was employed 1.0M phosphoric acid, and as a catholyte at the top was employed 1 ethylenediamine, and a concentration gradient of 50 5 was made by a gradient mixer. Electrophoresis was conducted at 900 volts and 40C for 48 hours, and after the separation, the sample was fractionated into a fraction collector in 1 mQ portions to measure pH. Biological activity was measured after separation of ampholite using PD 10 column G 25 column made by Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Inc. . Isoelectric point electrophoresis diagrams of I andII are shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. The result on I showed pI values of 8.55, 6.9, 8.25, 6.7, 5.8, 5.6, 6.09, 4.7, 4.19 and 3.54, and the result on II showed pI values of 8.0, 8.4, 8.5, 9.0 and 9.6. Thus, it seems that I and II are mixtures of physiologically active proteinaceous substances having similar molecular weights and different amino acid compositions. No characteristic peak was observed in the case ofIII. 5 The active fractions obtained in 2 above were freeze dried, and then dissolved in 0.05M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 in a concentration of 15,000 U mi. The solution was passed through a column of 1.5 cm inner diameter packed with 100 mt of Sephadex G 50 made by Pharmacia Fine Chemicals,Inc. . Elution was carried out with 0.05M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 at a flow rate of 0.05 in S.V. To obtain VO values, 3 mg mi y globulin molecular weight 160,000 , 3 mg mQ cytochrome C molecular weight 12,500, 3 mg mQ insulin molecular weight 5,700 and 3 mg mQ bacitracin molecular weight 1,450 were used as molecular weight markers. Since insulin has a low solubility under the neutral condition, it was eluted with 0.1N acetic acid. The eluting position of each marker was determined from the absorbancy at 280 nm. The results are shown in Fig. 5. To determine the molecular weights from the eluting positions, a relationship between the molecular weights and the eluting positions is shown in Fig. 6. These markers are positioned on a straight line on a semilogarithmic graph. Active fraction I showed molecular weights of 9,000 13,000, II 6,300 500, and III 2,400 500. It is seen from the foregoing results that the active fractions contain at least 15 species of substances shown in Table 1. 6 To determine the respective molecular weights, active fraction I obtained in 5 above was subjected to gel filtration by high pressure liquid chromatography. The high pressure liquid chromatography was carried out using BECKMANHPLC 342 made by Beckman, Inc. , and as the gel filtration column, TSK GPC column G 3,000SW 7.5 x 600 cm made byToyo Soda Kogyo Co., Ltd. . As the solvent, a mixture of 0.15M sodium chloride and 0.02M sodium acetate in the ratio of 1 1 was used at pH 6.0 as the molecular weight markers, 0.1 mg 0.2 mt cytochrome C molecular weight 12,500 , 0.1 mg 0.2 mt trypsin inhibitor molecular weight 21,500 , and 0.1 mg 0.2 mt aprotinin molecular weight 6,500 were used.The markers were positioned on a straight line on a logarithmic graph from their eluting positions. The components of the fraction were respectively subjected to gel filtration, and it was found that those appearing on the side of higher molecular weight by Sephadex G 50 had the following molecular weights.

Detection was made with UV at 280 nm, and 20 iit of the sample was injected. As the eluting solution, a buffer of 0.1M KH2P04, 0,1M Na2HP04 and 0.1M Na2S04 pH 6.8 was passed at a rate of 0.7 mQ min. As the molecular weight markers, 0.2 mg mi each of albumin molecular weight 69,000, ovalbumin molecular weight 45,000 , cytochrome C molecular weight 12,500 and insulin melecular weight 5,700 were used, and the calibration curve shown in Fig. 7 was obtained. It was found that each component had a molecular weight of 6,000.Example 2 Action of promoting DNA synthesis on human lymphoblast cells Active fraction I obtained in Example 1 was examined on the activity of promoting DNA synthesis ofNamalva strain of the lymphoblast cells derived from Burkitts lymphoma. The Namalva strain was cultured at 370C in a medium prepared by adding glutamine 4 mM , streptomycin 25 pg mQ , penicillin 25 U mQ , HEPES 10 mM , sodium bicarbonate 0.01 and fetal calf serum 108 to RPMI 1640 medium made by Nissui Seiyaku Co., Ltd. The cells were collected by centrifugation, and suspended sin the said medium freed from the fetal calf serum at a concentration of 5 x 105 cells mt. The suspension was poured in portions into a multidish plate with 24 holes and cultured at 370C. After 3 days, the medium was exchanged with a fresh medium, followed by culturing at 370C for 2 days. Then, the medium was exchanged again with a fresh medium, and samples dilutions of active fraction I and comparative samples FCS and insulin were added thereto.After culturing at 370C for 6 hours, tritium thymidine was added thereto to 0.5 pCi well, and the activities of its uptake were measured according to the ordinary procedure.The measurement values are averages of two runs of each test.
