# Gas insulated electric device and insulating gas.

## Abstract
A gas insulated electric device comprising an electric conductor 3 disposed in a sealed vessel 1 filled with an insulating gas 2 with the conductor 3 being supported by a solid insulating member 4 is disclosed. The insulating gas 2 is a nitrilic fluorocarbon compound or a mixture of a nitrilic fluorocarbon compound and SFâ‚†. In this device, the dielectric strength is increased. Ac cordingly, the size of the device can be decreased.
