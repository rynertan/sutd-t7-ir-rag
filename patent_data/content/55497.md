# Removal of hydrogen sulphide and carbonyl sulphide from gaseous mixtures.

## Abstract
Hydrogen sulphide and carbonyl sulphide are removed from a gaseous mixture in a staged procedure, characterized by conversion of the hydrogen sulphide to produce sulphur in aqueous solution, hydrolysis of the carbonyl sulphide remaining in the gaseous mixture to produce hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide, and removal of the hydrogen sulphide from the gas stream.
