# Electronic musical instrument.

## Abstract
A guitar like electronic instrument for use with a synthes iser 18 has a body 20 and a neck 22 . The neck carries six pitch strings 40 which the player depresses onto conductive frets to determine the selected note. The body carries six trigger strings 50 which can be plucked or strummed to initiate or trigger the desired notes. Alternatively they can be triggered by six keys 70 . The trigger strings 50 and pitch strings 40 are at an angle to each other. The three lower strings and the three higher strings can be triggered together by group trigger keys 300, 302 and all six strings triggered by a master trigger key 204 . If either of switches 200, 202 are actuated, notes will be triggered automatically as soon as the pitch string is depressed onto the fret. Touching of the string is detected by an a.c. waveform superposed on a d.c. potential. Hall effect devices are used to sense triggering by the trigger strings 50 or keys 70 . Each fret has eleven conductive sec tions so that sideways bending can be detected, and bend detection coils are embedded in the fingerboard for the same purpose. A vibrato arm 210 using a Hall effect device can be used to introduce a vibrato effect. A console 32 enables resetting of the note of each string, storing various set values for each string, transposition of the instrument as a whole, and a Capo effect to be obtained. A pedal unit 30 allows some functions to be selectively operated during playing, such as variation in the decay rate, or sustaining of notes played while a hold pedal is depressed.
