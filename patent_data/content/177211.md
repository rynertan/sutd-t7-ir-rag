# Improvements in or relating to heat exchangers.

## Abstract
A heat exchanger comprising a casing 2 through which pass a plurality of spaced apart tubes 1 . Heat exchange takes place through the tube walls between a first fluid within the tubes and a second fluid outside them but within the casing. The rate of heat exchange is enhanced by electrohy drodynamic effect by means of an electrode 15 comprising a sheet form first part 22 which encompasses the tubes, and connected second parts 26 which run lengthwise through the spaces between the tubes. The first part may be mesh like and the second parts may be mesh like and or rod like. The electrode is excited to high voltage by 16, 17, 18 and the casing and tubes are earthed. The effect of the second parts is to make the electric field around the individual tubes more uniform than would be the case if the electrode consisted of the first part 22 alone.
