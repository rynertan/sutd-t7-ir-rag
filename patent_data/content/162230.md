# METHOD OF RESTORING THE SURFACE OF A THERMOPLASTIC SUBSTRATE

## Abstract
Described herein is a method for restoring the surface of a substrate molded from a thermoplastic polymer after its surface has undergone conditioning by a strong oxidizing or reducing agent and or mechanical abrasion which comprises exposing the surface of the substrate to solvent vapors for a period of time such that the surface has been restored to essentially that before conditioning.
