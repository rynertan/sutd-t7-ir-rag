# Adjustable system for skew comparison of digital signals.

## Abstract
An exclusive OR gate receives first and second input digital signals for comparison and converts the time differen tial skew between the leading and trailing edges of the two signals into digital difference signals. An adjustable R C circuit converts the digital difference signals to analog signals for an amplitude detector having a set threshold value to detect non allowable skew levels.
