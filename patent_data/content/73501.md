# A cell for measurement.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a cell 1 into which liquid sample 2 to be measured is injected and which is provided with a sample inlet 16 and a sample receiving portion 7 . In the sample receiving portion 7 , a suction tube 14 for discharg ing liquid is inserted extending to the bottom 11 of the cell 1 and is connected to a suction pump 20 through an electro magnetic valve 18 . An inlection tube 13 for cleaning liquid is provided in proximity of the sample inlet 16 in a holder plate 12 and connected to a constant volume pump 21 for inject ing the cleaning liquid 22 . The discharge of the sample 2 by the suction pump 20 , the injection of the cleaning liquid 22 by the constant volume pump 21 and the discharge of clean ing liquid 22 by the suction pump 20 are controlled by a se quential timer circuit 24 .
