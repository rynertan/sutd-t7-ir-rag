# NUMERICAL CONTROL MACHINING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A numerical control machining system in which a surface machining pattern to be executed is classified as being one of a group of fundamental machining patterns stored in the sys tem. Following specification of at least one inside and or out side machining limit 40a which defines a machining region of a workpiece 40 , an optimum machining locus 100 is auto matically determined for a specified tool according to the se lected machining pattern. Then the workpiece 40 is machined along said locus 100 .
