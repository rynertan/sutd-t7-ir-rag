# Apparatus method for supporting cupboards and the like.

## Abstract
Apparatus for building, erecting or suspending structures includes a substantially horizontal elongate linear support member and a panel wherein the panel is releasably attached to the support member utilizing a lift and rotate assembly procedure. Suitable parts on the panel or on a bracket fixed thereto are capable of inter engaging with the support member. The elongate linear support member preferably has a vertical web and a horizontal web, the vertical web being provided with a horizontally extending flange, the linear sup port member being constructed to co operate with a panel intended to hang substantially vertical from the support member with its plane substantially perpendicular to the length of the support member. There is an engaging means between the upper edge of the panel and the support member and arranged to preclude horizontal separation of the panel and the support member once they are assembled together. The panel has a notch in its inner edge, the notch being positioned and dimensioned to receive the said flange to provide vertical support for the panel when the panel is pre sented to and hung from the support member.
