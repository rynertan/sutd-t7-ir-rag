# Movable skeg for non propelled barges.

## Abstract
An apparatus in the form of a skeg linkage arm 10 is disclosed for decreasing yaw of a first vessel 12 when the first vessel is pulled by a second vessel 14 which may alter natively be positioned to lessen water resistance when the first vessel 12 is pushed by the second vessel 14 . The apparatus includes a fin or skeg 20 movably secured to the first vessel 12 such that the fin 20 may be moved from a first position wherein the fin 20 is in the water to decrease yaw to a second position wherein water resistance is lessened. The apparatus 10 may further provide a linkage 30 for coupling the first and second vessels 12 14 wherein the apparatus 10 permits freedom of movement of the first vessel 12 relative to the second 14 for pitching, heaving, and, if desired rolling motions when the vessels 12 14 are coupled and further functions as a skeg 20 for the first vessel 12 when the first 12 is pulled by second vessel 14 .
