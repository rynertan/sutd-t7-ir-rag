# Rotary compressor.

## Abstract
A rotary compressor which essentially includes a shaft 4 , a compression mechanism 2 including a cylinder 11 and a rotary piston 12 provided on the shaft 4 to suck, compress and discharge refrigerant gas by rotating the rotary piston 12 eccentrically in the interior of the cylinder 11 , a motor 3 to drive the shaft 4 , a journal bearing 13, 14 to freely rotatably support the shaft 4 , and an axial direction oil groove 42, 44, 51 55, 57 being formed along with about the axial direction of the shaft 4 at a position corresponding to a low pressure area of an oil film of the lubricating oil L caused by a deflection of the shaft 4 due to the eccentric rotation of the rotary piston 12 .
