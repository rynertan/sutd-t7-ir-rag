# Lattice for a battery electrode substrate.

## Abstract
An improved substrate 30 for a battery electrode is disclo sed. The substrate is in the form of a reticulated lattice bordered by a current conducting perimeter 31 and having a current connection or tab 32 on the perimeter. The lattice is comprised of first current carrying portions 35 which converge toward an imaginary point outside the perimeter of the substrate, which point can lie on an imaginary bisector to the lattice. Second current carrying portions 38 intersect the first current carrying portions 35 and extend generally perpendicularly to them at the points of intersection. The lattice thus formed improves the current density of the electrode and provides for a more uniform current distribution, serves to focus current flow in the direction of the conducting tab, and mechanically strengthens the tab con nection to the substrate.
