# Method for production of a low alcoholic wine and agent for performance of the method.

## Abstract
A low alcoholic wine is produced by treatment of grape juice with glucose oxidase in the presence of oxygen, where upon the glucose deficient grape juice is fermented, whereby if wanted the formed gluconic acid is at least partially removed. The method is cheap, and also, an ideal low alcoholic wine is produced with all good properties of the normal wine, except for the lower alcohol content and the properties directly related to the lower alcohol content. The agent is a glucose oxidase preparation.
