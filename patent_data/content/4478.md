# Method and apparatus for vacuum moulding reinforced sheet plastics material.

## Abstract
Apparatus for reinforcing a layer of plastics material with fibrous reinforcement, such as glass fibre, comprises a support 5 having a flat or dished moulding surface 6 bounded by a gutter 7 having a channel 8 communicating with an outlet 9 . The plastics layer to be reinforced has a shape corresponding to that of the moulding surface and gutter. A plastics membrane 1 correspondingly shaped to the moulding surface thereby allows reinforcement of complex and sharply cornered shapes. The membrane will, when laid over the support 5 , overlap a seal 12 bounding the gutter 7 and outlet 9 and is for sandwiching the plastics layer, reinforcement and a polymerisable resin between the support 5 and the membrane 1 . In use, air is drawn through outlet 9 from between the membrane 1 and the plastics layer causing the resin to impregnate the reinforcement and bind it to the plastics layer. Any excess resin flows into the gutter where it may be retained conveniently until it hardens, the gutter subsequently being trimmed from the reinforced plastics part.
