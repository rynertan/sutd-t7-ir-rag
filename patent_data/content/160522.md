# Magnetic pole cores for electrorotary machines.

## Abstract
A magnetic pole core for an electrorotary machine, such as a DC or AC motor, has pole sections 17 which extend over the side of a coil 4 from base sections 10,11 . Each pole section 17 has two sub sections or pole pieces 20 and 21 and one of these pole pieces 20 has an extended section 22 which extends circumferentially of the coil. This struc ture prevents the formation of a start up dead point by enabling the centre of the magnetic poles of the armature which include the pole core to deviate circumferentially from the centre of the poles, or the mid point between poles, of a field magnet around the armature. The core also permits uniform rotation. There may also be a third pole piece 3 between the first and second pole pieces 21,22 and all the pole pieces may be integral with the base section 10,11 from which they extend.
