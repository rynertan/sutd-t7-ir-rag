# Automotive antenna system.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a diversity reception type automotive antenna system comprising two pairs of high frequency pickups 32, 62 and 92, 94 for detecting surface high frequency currents induced on the vehicle body by radio or other waves and flowing concentrically in the marginal edges of the vehicle body, each of said two pairs of high frequency pickups being mounted respectively on one of the front pillars 32, 94 and one of the trunk hinges 62, 92 at the same side of the vehicle body to form a non directional antenna unit, the non directional antenna units being changed from one to another only depending on variations in the level of the radio or other waves due to variations in the electric field to reduce the frequency of change from one antenna unit to the other and noise due to variations in S N ratio and at the same time to maintain the same reception in the automative antenna system irrespective of the direction of the vehicle body relative to the incoming waves.
