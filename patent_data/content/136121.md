## Description
FLAT MINIATURIZED ELECTRIC MOTOR This invention relates to a flat, miniaturized electric motor, and more particularly to a flat, miniaturized electric motor consisting of a rotor held between two shallow bowl shaped end brackets, and a rotor supported rotatably by the end brackets in such a manner that the rotor faces the stator with a gap therebetween. Fig. l a is a sectional view through the structure of a conventional flat, miniaturized electric motor. This flat, miniaturized electric motor consists of a stator 1 which has a plurality of windings 2 thereon and is held between two bowl shaped end brackets 3, 4, and a rotor 5 supported rotatably on a shaft 6 by bearings 7 which are provided in the end brackets 3, 4 in such a manner that the rotor 5 faces the inner circumferential surface of the stator 1 with a gap therebetween When an electric current is applied to the stator windings 2 in a suitable manner, the rotor 5 rotates. Reference numeral 8 denotes a bearing housing provided on the front end bracket 4 so that it acts as a mounting and centering guide, and 9 denotes an output pulley mounted on the rotor shaft 6. Fig. l b illustrates an example of a method of mounting this electric motor on a machine. A mounting hole 10 1 of diameter d1 slightly larger than the outer diameter d1 of the bearing housing 8, which will act as a mounting and centering guide for the electric motor, is provided in part of a base plate 10 of an apparatus on which the electric motor is to be mounted. The outer diameter do of the pulley 9 is set to be slightly smaller than that d of the bearing housing. In order to mount the electric motor to which the pulley 9 is attached onto the base plate 10 in the direction of the arrow, the pulley 9 is inserted through the hole 10 1 in the base plate 10, the bearing housing 8 is then fitted into the same hole 10 1, and the electric motor is attached to the base plate 10 with screws not shown . During this mounting, if the difference between the outer diameter d1 of the bearing housing 8 and the diameter d1 of the hole 10 1 in the base plate 10 is minimized, mountinr,and centering errors can be reduced to a low level. Therefore, the outer diameter d1 of the bearing housing 8 provided on the end bracket 4 is very significant, so that with a conventional flat, miniaturized electric motor, the bearing housing 8 and the end bracket 4 are manufactured as separate parts, and are then attached unitarily, as shown in Fig. l a . However, in the flat, miniaturized electric motor of this conventional construction, the inner and outer surfaces of the bearing housing must be processed to correct any alignment errors which might occur when the bearing housing is attached to the end bracket, after the end bracket 4 and bearing housing 8 have been manufactured independently and attached unitarily. This results in an increase in the cost of manufacturing of the electric motor. An object of this invention is to provide a flat, miniaturized electric motor in which these problems encountered in a conventional electric motor of this kind can be eliminated, and which can be manufactured at a low cost. The flat, miniaturized electric motor according to this invention consists of a stator held between two shallow bowl shaped end brackets, and a rotor supported rotatably on the end brackets in such a manner that the rotor faces the stator with a gap therebetween, and characterized in that the electric motor is provided with a short, cylindrical member which houses therein a bearing supporting the rotor thereon, and which projects outward from at least one of the end brackets, and another short, cylindrical member of a diameter larger than the outer diameter of the first short, cylindrical member, which is provided concentrically with and on the outer side of the first short, cylindrical member, which consists of a plurality of arcuate, circumferentially spaced projections, and which constitutes a mounting and centering guide. This and other objects as well as features of the invention will become clear from the following description of the embodiment, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Fig. l a is a sectional view through a conventional flat,miniaturized electric motor Fig. l b illustrates a method of mounting the electric motor on a machine Fig. 2 a is a sectional view through an embodiment of the device of this invention and Figs. 2 b and 2 c are a front elevation and a sectioned side elevation of an end bracket thereof. As shown in Figs. 2 a 2 c the conventional bearing housing 8 is not used in the device of this invention this device is provided with a short, cylindrical member 14 1 housing therein a bearing 7 arranged in substantially at the center of an end bracket 4 on the output shaft side, and another short, cylindrical member 14 2 arranged concentrically with and on the outer side of the first short, cylindrical member 14 1, and which constitutes a mounting and centering guide, both cylindrical members 14 1, 14 2 projecting outward from the end bracket 4. The end bracket 4 of this invention is extrusion formed by pressing a piece of circular sheet metal in such a manner that the final product has a circular portion a shallow bowl shaped rim 14 4 which stands upright from the outer circumference of the circular portion, and which is used to hold the stator the bearing housing short, cylindrical member 14 1 standing upright from the central portion of the circular portion, so as to extend in the direction opposite to that in which the rim 14 4 extends and another short, cylindrical member 14 2 which stands upright in the same direction as the first short, cylindrical member 14 1 from a section of the circular portion which is on the outer side thereof, and which constitutes a centering guide used when the electric motor is mounted on a machine.The short, cylindrical member 14 2 constituting the centering guide is so formed that it does not have a continuous, annular cross section, in order to maintain a satisfactory strength thereof it is formed in the shape of a partially cutaway cylinder, i.e., it consists of a plurality of circumferentially spaced, cross sectionally arcuate, upright members. L1, L2 are the lengths, measured from the mounting surface of the end bracket 4, of the upright short, cylindrical members 14 1, 14 2, respectively. When L1 is greater than L2, the end surface of the pulley 9 mounted on the output shaft facing the short, cylindrical member 14 1 extending from the end bracket 4 can be provided with recess as shown in Fig. 2 a . This means that the pulley 9 can be positioned closer to the mounting surface of the electric motor, and thus the volume of the space occupied by the electric motor in a machine can be reduced, and the machine can be miniaturized. When at least one of the end brackets 3, 4 is made of a magnetic material, such as iron or the like, any leaking magnetic flux from the stator or rotor flowing in the direction of the output shaft can be absorbed by the end bracket and recirculated to the electric motor. Thus, the quantity of axially leaking magnetic flux can be reduced.
