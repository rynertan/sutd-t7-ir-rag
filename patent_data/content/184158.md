# CONTROL UNIT FOR A MICROPROGRAMMABLE PROCESSOR

## Abstract
A controller 20 of a microprocessor includes a control store 201, 203 for storing microinstructions. A programm able logic array PLA 204 , enabled when a predetermined instruction type is to be executed, translates the operand field of the microinstruction into information bits which are used to modify the microinstruction as it is being fetched from the control store. The bits of the microinstruction which are changeable are coupled from the control store 201, 203 to a first input of a multiplexer 202 . The output of the PLA 204 is coupled to a second input of the multiplexer. A select signal for the multiplexer is generated when the predeter mined instruction type is to be executed, thereby effecting a modification of the fetched microinstruction, and yielding a modification to the basic operation of the microinstruction.
