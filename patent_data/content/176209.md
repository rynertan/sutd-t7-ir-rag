# SLIDABLE WORK SURFACE

## Abstract
A work surface 11 is mounted on a pair of brackets 22 which are releasably mounted on and project outwardly in cantilevered relationship from respective and uprights 16 of a wall panel 13 . In each end rail 36 of the work surface 11 a latching lever 62 is pivoted at 63 and biased down by a spring 67 to latch with the respective bracket 22 . The lever 12 prevents the work surface 11 moving away from the panel 13 and from being lifted upwards and has one end 79 accessible beneath the rear edge 38 of the work surface 11 to be manually moved upwardly to release the work surface 11 from the bracket 22 , whereupon the work surface 11 can be slidably displaced outwardly away from the panel 13 . When the work surface 11 is manually slidably moved forwardly toward the panel 13 , the lever 62 automatically re engages its respective bracket. Each lever 62 has a catch part 71 that engages the edge of a hole 74 in part of the respective bracket 22 . To release the catch part 71 , the work surface 11 is moved slightly towards the panel 13 before the end 79 is pressed upwards.
