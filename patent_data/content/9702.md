## Description
A PHENYLALKYLAMINOETHYLSALICYLAMIDE, ITS PBEPARATION AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING IT.This invention relates to a phenylalkylaminoethylsalicyl amid, its preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing it. More particularly it relates to one optical isomer of labetalol, 5 l hydroxy 2 l rnethyl 3 phenylpropylamino ethyl salicylamide. The substance labetalol is known from British patent specification 1,266,058 and U.S.P. 4,012,444. Its pharmacological przoperties are discussed by Farmer et. al. in British Journal of Pharmacology, 45 660 675 1972 , who designate itAH5158 it is shown to block a and ss adrenergic receptors, suggesting that it would be useful in the treatment of arrhythmia, hypertension and angina pectoris.The unique pharmacological properties of labetalol and its use as an antihypertensive agent are said to be largely a function of the exquisite balance of its a and blocking activities. The file history of U.S.P. 4,012,444 indeed indicates that slight changes in the chemical structure of labetalol deleteriously affect this balance, and, even in the few analogous compounds where the balance is retained, the absolute potencies of these compounds are shown to be too low for them to be useful antihypertensive agents. Therefore, in the treatment of hypertension, labetalol is the compound of choice among those disclosed in British patent specification 1,266,058 and U.S.P. 4,012,444. Labetalol has two asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms and therefore can exist as two diastereoisomers and four optical isomers. Indeed, British patent specification 1,266,058 and U.S.P. 4,012,444 disclose that compounds such as labetalol have optically active forms, but give no exampie of an optically active form. These patent specifications teach that the racemic mixtures may be resolved by conventional methods, for example by salt formation with an optically active acid, followed by fractional crystallization but give no method of resolution. Example 14 of each specification does indeed describe the separation of labetalol into two diastereoisomers 1 and 2 , using benzoic acid, but this is not an optical resolution.In British patent specifications 1,541,932 and 1,541,933, isomer 1 is designated diastereoisomer A and is characterised as that diastereoisomer whose hydrochloride salt has the higher melting point.These two British patent specifications also disclose that diastereoisomer A is a valuable antiarrhythmic agent since it has strongly reduced adrenergic blocking activity and is therefore useful in the treatment of people who have suffered myocardial infarction.We have now discovered that diastereoisomer A is composed of the S,R and R,S optical isomers of labetalol, whereas 1 astereoisomer B is composed of the S,S and RgR optical isomers. We have also surprisingly found that the novel R,R optical isomer of labetalol exhibits, in comparison with labetalol itself, both an unexpectedly high increase in ss adrener gic blocking potency and a decrease in a adrenergic blocking potency. Thus, when the R,R optical isomer is compared with labetalol, the ratio of the XB adrenergic blocking potency to the a adrenergic blocking potency is found to be greatly and unexpectedly increased.In particular, animal tests have indicated that the R,R optical isomer has about twelve times the .B blocking potency of labetalol, but only about one third of the a blocking potency of labetalol. These.properties could in no way have been predicted theoretically, especially as the blocking potency of diastereoisomer B is not significantly different from that of labetalol and the ablocking potency of diastereoisomer B is half that of labetalol. Indeed, it is clear, when the activities of the four optical isomers of labetalol are compared, that the activities of the diastereoisomers A and B and indeed of labetalol itself cannot be calculated from the activities of their components.One can put this the other way around by saying that the aand blocking activities of the four optical isomers of labetalol do not merely average to give the a and blocking activites of labetalol and of its diastereoisomers A and B.Some of the activities are much greater than could ever have been expected on a simple basis of mathematical proportions, in particular the high blocking activity of the R,R optical isomer this activity is much higher than the ss bloc . king activity of diastereoisomer B so that antagonism evidently exists between the S,S and R,R optical isomere with respect to the blocking activity. This degree of antagonism could in no way have been foreseen. In the absence of this antagonism, the R,R optical isomer shows a balance of properties that make it the optical isomer of choice in the treatment of hypertension. In particular, the R,R optical isomer possesses potent antihypertensive activity and rapid onset of activity while substantially lacking the undesirable sid etfects usually associated with a blockade, e.g.postural hypotension.The following Table shows the relationships between labetalol, its diastereoisomersA and B and the four pure optical isomers below each compound are given its potencies as an a blocking and then as a blocking agent, all relative to the values for labetalol assigned values 1.0 for each blocking activity EMI5.1 tb SEP labetalol tb SEP 1.0 SEP 1.0 tb SEP diastereoisomer SEP A SEP diastereoisomer SEP B tb SEP 1.2 SEP 0.16 SEP 0.5 SEP 1.2 tb SEP S,R SEP R,S SEP S,S SEP R,R tb SEP isomer SEP isomer SEP isomer SEP isomer tb 4.9 SEP 0.05 SEP 0.4 SEP 0.3 SEP 0.8 SEP 0.02 SEP 0.3 SEP 12.3 tb This table clearly shows the unexpectedly high blocking activity and ratio of ss alpha blocking activities possessed by the R,R optical isomer. Additionally, the R,R optical isomer has been found to possess greater direct peripheral vasodilation activity than labetalol, and this also contributes to its anti hypertensive activity. Moreover, the R,R optidal isomer is substantially non toxic at therapeutic doses. According to the invention therefore we provide the R,R optical isomer of labetalol, namely 5 l hydroxy 2 R l methyl 3 phenylpropyl amino ethyl salicylamide, which can be characterised by means of its hydrochloride salt which is dimorphic with m.pts. of about 133 134 C. and about 192 193.5 C. and an alpha D26 of about 30.60 conc. 1 mg. ml., ethanol , said R,R optical isomer being substantially free of the corresponding R,S , S,R and S,S optical isomers, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Such salts include especially the above mentioned hydrochloride salt, the sulfate, maleate, tartrate and citrate salts, and also the acetate, phthalate, succinate, lactate, malate, cinnamate, hydrobromide and phosphate salts.As far as we know, no one has succeeded in resolving labetalol by standard methods and no individual optical isomer of labetalol has yet been disclosed. Indeed, we ourselves have tried several standard methods of resolving labetalol by salt formation with an optically active acid, but all these standard methods have failed. In particular, all our attempts to resolve diastereoisomer B of labetalol using the following reagents have failed N acetyl L leucine, N tosyl L glutamic acid, N tosyl L leucine and N tosyl D leucine. We have tberefore concluded that attempts to resolve diastereoisomer B by such methods are likely to fail and that stereospecific synthesis most probably offers a more fruitful route to the individual isomers of labetalol and in particular to the R,R optical isomer thereof.An especially preferred embodiment of such a stereospecific synthesis is shown in the following reaction scheme EMI7.1 In this reaction scheme compounds 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 are novel and are features of the invention 0 shows an unsubstituted phenyl group and asterisks indicate asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms and the various steps can be described in general terms as follows A i Formation of phenolate salt with a strong base in an organic solvent ii introduction of a protecting group on to the phenolic oxygen atom iii bromination with bromine in an inert organic solvent.B i Condensation to a Schiff s base, e.g. by hea ting in a water immiscible organic solvent in the presence of an acid catalyst with azeotro pic removal of water ii reduction of the Schiff s base to a secondary amine iii resolution of this secondary amine into its op tical antipodes and isolation of the R optical isomer.C Condensation to a tertiary amine by reaction in an in ert organic solvent in the presence of an aed binding agent.D1 ReductionD2 Separation of isomers, e.g. by chromatography.E Hydrogenolysis of protecting groups with hydrogen and a catalyst and isolation of the R,R optical isomer e.g. as an acid addition salt.The novel and inventive process is of course not restricted exactly to the sequence of steps given above.According to the invention, one process for the preparation of the novel R,R optical isomer of labetalol and of its pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, substantially free of the corresponding R,S , S,R and S,S optical isomers, comprises removing the protecting groups from an N,O protected R,R optical isomer or acid addition salt thereof, the term N,O protected indicating that the basic nitrogen atom and the phenolic hydroxy group are protected, and isolating the resulting R,R optical isomer as the free base or as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt.The protecting groups are preferably such groups as can be removed by hydrogenolysis, e.g. by means of hydrogen and palladium on carbon examples of such groups include theN or O benzyl, N or O benzyloxycarbonyl, N or O benzhydryl, N trichloroethoxycarbonyl cr N trityl group. Preferably both protecting groups are benzyl groups. Alternatively, the protecting groups can be such groups as are removable by mild hydrolysis, e.g., an N or O benzyloxycarbonyl or N trifluoroacetyl group.The N,O protected R,R optical isomer used as starting material in the above process according to the invention is preferably obtained by resolution of an N,O protected R,R S,R diastereoisomeric mixture. This resolution can conveniently be effected by physical methods, e.g.by chromatography especially on silica gel. This N,O protec ted R,R S,R diastereoisomeric mixture can be obtained by reduction of an N,O protected 5 N R 1 methyl 3 phenylpropyl glycyl salicylamide, preferably by means of a borohydride in an organic solvent,especially sodium borohydride in a lower alkanol such as methanol or ethanol.Other reducing agents that can conveniently be used include lithium borohydride or an alkalimetalalkylborohydride, e.g. lithium or potassium tri s butylborohydride or lithium or potassium tri 3 methyl 2 butyl borohydride, in an organic solvent such as tetrahydr6furan. The N,O protected phenylpropyl gly cyl salicylamide can be obtained by condensation of a 4 O protected alpha bromo 3 carbamoylacetophenone with an R N protected 1 methyl 3 phenylpropylamine, for example in the presence of an excess of the latter reagent, or of triethylamine or 2,2,6,6 tetramethylpiperidine or on espe cially of potassium carbonate as acid binding agent, also of dimethylformamide as organic solvent.The 4 O protected alpha bromo 3 carbamoylacetophenone can be prepared by protection of the phenolic hydroxy group of 5 ac et ylsalicylamide , e.g. by formation of an alkali salt and benzylation with benzylchloride the bromine atom in the side chain can then be introduced by bromination with bromine in chloroform.The R N protected l methyl 3 phenylpropylamine can be prepared by condensation of an amine carrying a suitable protecting group, e.g. benzylamine, with benzyl acetone, preferably under reflux in a water immiscible organic solvent and in the presence of a strong acid catalyst e.g. p toluenesulfonic acid, with continous removal of water.The resulting Schiff s base is then reduced under mild conditions, e.g. with sodium borohydride in methanol, so as not to remove the protecting group Alternatively, the N protecting group can be directly introduced into l methyl 3 phenylpropylamine. The N protected l methyl 3 phenylpropylamine can then be resolved and the R optical isomer isolated, e.g. with N p toiuenesul fonyl L leucine followed by N acetyl L leucine, or with N p toluenesulfonyl D leucine. Other reagents that may be used include 2,3,5,6 di O isopropylidene 2 keto L gulonic acid and the D and L forms of dibenzoyl tartaric acid, ditoluoyl tartaric acid and mandelic acid. If desired, the resolution can be deferred until step C condensation has been carried out.A further feature bf the present invention comprises Åa process for the preparation of the R,R optical isomer of labetalol and its pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, substantially free of the corresponding R,S , S,R and S,S optical isomers, consisting of the steps of condensing a 4 0 protected a bromo 3 carbamoylacetophenone with an N protected l methyl 3 phenylpropylamine, obtaining an N,O protected 51 methyl 3 phenylpropyl glycyl salicylamide either by using an R N protected l methyl 3 phenylpropylamine in the foregoing condensation or by resolving the resulting racemic N,O protected 5 N l methyl 3 phenylpropyl glycyl salicylamide, reducing the N,O protected j R l methyl 3 phenylpropylglycyl salicylamide to a mix ture of an N,O protected 5 5 3 phenylpropyl amino ethyl salicylymide and the corresponding S,R optical isomer, separating from this mixture the N,O protected 59 t R 1 hydroxy 2 R 1 methyl 3 phenylpropyl amino ethyl salicylamide, removing the protecting groups therefrom and isolating 5 f R l hydroxy 2 R 1 methyl 3 phenylpropyl amino ethyl salicylamide as the free base or as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof.A preferred feature of this process comprises the steps of condensing 4 benzyloxy a bromo 3 carbamoylacetophenone with R N benzyl 1 methyl 3 phenylpropylamine to yield 2 O benzyl 5 N benzyl N R 1 methyl 3 phenylpropy1 I salicylamide, reducing this compound to a mixture of 2 0 benzyl 5 j R l hydroxy 2 R l methyl 5 phenylpropyl benzylaminoethyl salicylamide and the corresponding S,R optical isomer, separating from this mixture 2 0 benzyl 5 R l hydroxy 2 R 1 methyl 3 phenylpropyl benzylamino ethyl salicylamide, removing the protecting N and O benzyl groups therefrom by hydrogenolysis and isolating 5 i R 1 hydroxy 2 R 1 methyl 3 phenylpropyl amino ethyl salicylamide as the free base or as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof. This preferred process can be carried out under condi tions described above. Thus the step of condensing preferably effected in the presence of potassium carbonate as acid binding agent and of dimethylformamide as inert organic solvent the step of reducing is preferably effected by means of an alkali metal borohydride in an inert organic solvent and the step of separating is conveniently effected by chromatography.The R,R isomer can be isolated as the free base or as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. These salts can be prepared by standard methods.The hydrochloride salt of the novel R,R optical isomer is dimorphic and exists in two crystalline forms m.pt.about 133 134 and about 192 193.50C. The characterising constants given in the Example part E are for the higher melting presumably the thermodynamically more stable crystalline form, although either form may be obtained.The a and blocking activities discussed earlier in this specification can be determined by known methods, e.g. by those of Farmer et.al., Brit. J. Pharm., 45, 660 1972 Robson, J. Pharm. Exp. Therap., 175, 157 1970 , and Levy, Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. Ther., 204,. 143 197 3 .

Laboratory tests indicate that the effective oral dose ED50 for the R,R isomer or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof will typically lie within the range of 0.01 to 25 mg. kg., preferably 0.5 to 5 mg. kg., of mammalian weight.The invention therefore provides pharmaceutical compositions containing as active ingredient 5 xy 2 t R l methyl 3 phenylpropyl amino ethyl sali cylamide or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof together with a pharmaceutical carrier or excipient, said R,R optical isomer being substantially free of the corresponding R,S , S,R and S,S optical isomers. The compositions are preferably in the form of dosage units e.g. tablets, pills, capsules, suppositories or injectable preparations in ampoules. The compositions may also be for example in the form of powders, syrups, elixirs or suspensions. The required daily dosage may be administered in single or divided doses. The exact dose to be administered will, of course, be dependent upon various factors such as the age and weight of the subject mammal and the individual response.Dosage units preferably contain from 2 to 500 mg., more preferably from 10 to 200 mg., of the R,R isomer according to the invention or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof . ical pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for use in Íormulations described above are exemplified by sugars such as lactose, sucrose, mannitol and sorbitol starches such as corn starch, tapioca starch and potato starch cellulose and derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and methyl cellulose calcium phosphates such as dicalcium phosphate and tricalcium phosphate sodium sulfate calcium sulfate polyvinylpyrrolidone polyvinyl alcohol stearic acid alkaline earth mental stearates such as magnesium stearate and calcium stearate vegetable oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, olive oil and corn oil non ionic, cationic and anionic surfactants ethylene glycol polymers P cyclodextrin fatty alcohols hydrolyzed cereal solids and other non toxic compatible fillers, binders, disintegrants, and lubricants commonly used in pharmaceutical formulations.In treating certain patients with the R,R isomer of this invention, it may be desirable to include other pharmaceutically active ingredients in the same composition.For example, in treating patients in whom salt and water retention is a problem, effective amounts of a diuretic, e.g., hydrochlorothiazide or trichloromethiazide, may be included. Pharmaceutical FormulationsIn the following examples, the active ingredient is pre r Tetr ly 5 A 1 hydroxy 2 A 1 methyl 3 phenyl propyl aminoethyl 1 salicylamide hydrochloride, but an equivalent quantity of the R,R isomer itself or of another pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt, especially a salt named herein, may be substituted Injectable Solution mg. mi.
