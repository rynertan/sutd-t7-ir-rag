## Description
Processes for measuring quantities of gases and for delivering predetermined amounts of liquids and apparatuses to carry out these processes. The invention relates to processes for measuring quantities of gases and for delivering predetermined amounts of liquids and to apparatuses to carry out these processes. More particularly, the invention provides a process which is very well suited to measure the quantity of gas formed in a chemical process, for instance the quantity of carbon dioxide produced by a fermenting dough. In principle, two methods can be applied for measuring a quantity of gas determination of a volume change at constant pressure or determination of a pressure change at constant volume. The method of the invention is based on the first mentioned principle. A simple application of this principle comprises displacement of liquid in a burette which can be adjusted in a vertical direction to make the pressures at the beginning and the end of the measurement equal to each other. Apparatuses based on this principle are described by C.H. Bailey and A.H. Johnson, Cereal Chem. 1, 293 1924 S. Eisenberg, Ibid., 430 1940 S. Burrows and J.S. Harrison, J.Inst.Brewing, 65, 39 1959 . Examples of recording apparatuses, using for instance a collecting vessel for the displaced liquid provided with a float to which a stylus is attached, are described by M.C. Markley and 0.11. Bailey, Cereal Chem. 9, 591 1932 G.L. Rubenthaler et al., Cereal Chem. 57 3 , 212 1980 and in Kent Jones Adams, Modern Cereal Chemistry Food Trade Press Ltd., London, 6th Ed. 1967 , page 359 SJA apparatus . Examples of recording instruments operating with varying gas pressure, are the Chopin Zymotachegraph and the Brabender Fermentograph see Modern Cereal Chemistry, pages 355 and 359 . Existing methods and instruments often show one or more of the following disadvantages they are based on pressure measurement and thus require complicated calculations or calibration procedures, they do not permit automatic recording, they need specially trained personnel for handling, they are difficult to automatize, they have a low precision.In these respects the method and apparatus of the invention compare favourably with known methods and apparatuses. The process of delivering predetermined amounts of liquids according to the invention comprises introducing a gas into the lower of two vessels which are closed from the atmosphere and which comprise the liquid to be delivered, which two vessels are interconnected by a tube ending below the liquid level in the lower vessel, which causes the liquid to rise in a small, third vessel ,measuring pipette interconnected to the lower vessel by a tube which is provided with a closing valve, which measuring pipette has an opening above the liquid level and a liquid outlet with a closing valve and is provided with means to control the liquid level in such a way that each time the liquid level reaches a predetermined maximum the tube between said lower vessel and the measuring pipette is closed and the outlet valve is opened and each time the liquid level comes below a predetermined minimum the tube between said lower vessel and the measuring pipette is opened and the outlet is closed. It will be clear that the distance between maximum and minimum level will define a certain quantity of liquid and that by introducing a constant stream of gas this quantity will be delivered at regular intervals. The control of the liquid level may take place in various ways. Non mechanical, for instance electric or optical, methods are preferred. A suitable method involves the use of a measuring pipette provided with electrodes which are connected to a control unit acting on the valves, in such a way that each time the liquid reaches the highest electrode the tube between said lower vessel and the measuring pipette is closed and the outlet is opened and each time the liquid level comes below a second, lower electrode the tube between the lower vessel and the measuring pipette is opened and the outlet is closed.This is a suitable method when an electricity conducting liquid is to be delivered, for instance an aqueous electrolyte solution. The process of the invention for measuring quantities of gases comprises introducing a gas into the lower of two vessels which are closed from the atmosphere and which comprise a liquid, which two vessels are interconnected by a tube ending below the liquid level in the lower vessel, which causes the liquid to rise in a small, third vessel measuring pipette interconnected to the lower vessel by a tube which is provided with a closing valve, which measuring pipette has an opening to the atmosphere and an outlet with a closing valve and is provided with means to control the liquid level and a counter in such a way that each time the liquid level reaches a predetermined maximum the tube between said lower vessel and the measuring pipette is closed and the outlet is opened and each time the liquid level comes below a predetermined minimum the tube between said lower vessel and the measuring pipette is opened and the outlet is closed and that the counter counts the number of times that the measuring pipette is filled and emptied. The indication of the counter and the volume delivered by the measuring pipette determine the quantity of the gas. For instance, when the pipette delivers one cm3 of liquid and the indication of the counter is n, the gas quantity is n cm3.It will be understood that the gas to be measured should be virtually insoluble in the liquid. When measuring carbon dioxide, this can be achieved by acidifying the liquid. It has been found that good results can also be obtained when carbon dioxide is introduced for some time before the actual measurement, so that the liquid will be more or less saturated with the gas. The invention also provides an apparatus to carry out the above described processes. The apparatus comprises two vessels an upper vessel and a lower vessel which are interconnected by a tube extending in the lower vessel, which lower vessel has an inlet and is connected by a tube with a closing valve to a small, third vessel measuring pipette , which measuring pipette has an opening at the upper side and a liquid outlet with a closing valve at the bottom. In this specification and the accompanying claims the terms upper , lower and bottom refer to the position of the vessels when the apparatus is in operation and the term valve refers to any means to interrupt a flow of gas or liquid. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the measuring pipette comprises a number of electrodes.It is further preferred that the position of at least one of the electrodes can be adjusted. In a further preferred embodiment the closing valve between the lower vessel and the measuring pipette and the outlet of the measuring pipette are combined in a three way valve. The materials used for the apparatus will depend on the gas and the liquid to be used or measured. Glass vessels and tubing made of a corrosion resistant material are suited for many purposes. Red copper tubing is preferred in many instances as it does not corrode quickly and is easy to work up. The connections between vessels and tubing are suitably made of a gas tight flexible material such as butyl rubber.The measuring pipette is preferably made of a hard plastic material such as acryl glass e.g. Perspex commat which can be worked up easily and with great precision and in which electrodes can be readily fitted. When the liquid used is water, materials like acryl glass further have the advantage that they are waterrepellent, so that the liquid easily flows out. The volume of the upper vessel should be sufficient for the total gas volume to be measured. The volume to be delivered by the measuring pipette will depend on the volume of gas to be measured and the accuracy required. For instance, volumes or 500, 50 and 1 ml for respectively the upper and lower vessel and the measuring pipette are suitable for measurement of gas evolution during a few hours with a flow speed in the order of milliliters per minute. The minimum volume of the measuring pipette will depend on the characteristics of the material and from the fact whether the measuring pipette is provided with electrodes. The valves are preferably magnetic valves, which can be actuated by generally known. electric control means. The apparatus or a number of them is are preferably placed in a cupboard with thermostatically controlled air temperature. During measurement the opening at the upper side of the measuring pipette may be in connection with the atmosphere. This may imply that corrections to the measuring results have to be made, for instance when it is desired to reduce the results of a series of measurements to the same pressure. Alternatively the measuring pipette may be connected to a vessel in which the gas air pressure is automatically maintained at a constant value. A preferred embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawing which schematically shows the apparatus of the invention connected with a gas source, a liquid collecting vessel, a counter and control and recording units. The figures in the drawing have the following meanings 1 is a flask, 2 and 3 are the lower and upper vessels interconnected by the tube 4 which extends into the lower vessel 2 , 5 is the measuring pipette, 6 is an adjustable electrode, 7 and 8 are fixed electrodes, 9 is a collecting vessel, 10 is a non return valve, 11 is an inlet tube for compressed air, 12 is a tube connecting collecting vessel 9 with vessel 3 , 13, 14 and 15 are outlets to the atmosphere, 16 and 17 are magnetic valves, 18, 19 and 20 are three way magnetic valves, the positions used being indicated by dashed lines, 21 is a counter, 22 is a control unit, comprising means to actuate valve 20 and means to convert the weak signal of the electrodes into a stronger signal for said actuating means, 23 is a recorder, 24 and 25 are electrodes, 26 is a control unit acting on valves 16, 17 and 19. The drawing represents a suitable configuration for determining the amount of gas formed in flask 1 by a chemical reaction e.g. in fermenting dough. Before the measurement starts, the valves 16 and 17 are closed, flask 1 is connected with the atmosphere through three way valve 18 , collecting vessel 9 is connected with the atmosphere through three way valve 19 and the vessel 2 is connected with the measuring pipette 5 through the three way valve 20 . The gas produced in the flask 1 can be meaured as follows. The position of valve 18 is altered to connect flask 15 with vessel 2 and the pressure of the gas in vessel 2 makes the liquid rise in the measuring pipette 5 .When the liquid level reaches electrode 6 , an electric pulse is given to the counter 21 and the control unit 22 which acts on valve 20 , so that vessels 2 and 5 are disconnected and the measuring pipette 5 is brought in connection with the outlet of valve 20 . When the liquid comes below electrode 7 , the control unit makes the valve 20 return to its original position and the liquid begins to rise again in the measuring pipette 5 etc. The recorder 23 may registrate the number of times that the measuring pipette 5 is filled i.e. the volume of gas produced as a function of the time. By including a digital analog converter between the counter 21 and the recorder 23 a curve of the gas volume may be produced.When the gas produced in a particular time interval is to be measured, it is convenient to connect valve 18 to a control unit with a time switch, so that the measurement can be stopped without the apparatus being watched. By measuring a volume of gas and the time elapsed between beginning and end of the measurement, the flow speed can be obtained. For the same purpose a counter may be incorporated which indicates the number of pulses received per time unit. From time to time a gas bubble will escape from vessel 2 into vessel 3 . This is immediately compensated by an amount of liquid from vessel 3 . The liquid in the collecting vessel 9 may be returned to vessel 3 by compressed air, entering through tube 11 . Valves 16 and 17 should then be opened. When the apparatus is to be used to deliver predetermined quantities of liquid, the collecting vessel should be omitted, so that, for instance, a row of flasks can be moved under the outlet of valve 20 so as to fill each flask with the predetermined quantity of liquid. By using magnetic valves and appropriate control means such as a control unit 26 connected with electrodes 24 and 25 and with valves 16 , 17 and 19 , starting and stopping of the measurement and refilling of vessel 3 may be fully automatized. It is also possible to use manually operated stopcocks to carry out these steps by hand.
