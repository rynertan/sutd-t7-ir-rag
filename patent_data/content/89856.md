# Improved concentrates of lubricant additives.

## Abstract
Dispersants and basic magnesium detergents tend to interact when mixed in additive concentrates and in bulk lubricants resulting in an undesirable increase in viscosity. It has bean found that this problem may be significantly reduced if the dispersant is prereacted with a basic salt containing an alkali metal such as sodium, preferably in an amount corresponding to at least 0.001 gram atoms alkali metal per 100 grams dispersant. The reaction product may be used in concentrates containing basic magnesium deter gents for use in lubricants.
