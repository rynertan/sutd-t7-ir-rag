# Substrate for a magnetic disc and method manufacturing same.

## Abstract
A substrate for magnetic discs, which are to be used as external storage in data processors is formed from glass like carbon materials by themselves or contained in a thermoset ting resin matrix. The glass like carbon materials are excel lent in thermal resistance, can be finished to mirror like surface, and have less surface defects than aluminum substrates. Magnetic materials can be adhered directly onto the surface of such substrates shaped in the form of a disc and the resulting disc has good hardness, is resistant to elevated temperatures, is less likely to deform and is low in cost.
