# Apparatus for generating at least one moving object across a video display screen where wraparound of the object is avoided.

## Abstract
In a video game where an object, such as a ship, moves across the screen and where wraparound exists when the object is displayed near the edge of the screen, binary logic architecture provides for use of only a single bit of data to determine which portion of the object is to be displayed. This allows a standard bit capacity random access memory and horizontal address counter to be utilized in the circuit.
