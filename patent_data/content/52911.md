## Description
SINGLE CRYSTAL SINGLE GRAIN ALLOY This invention relates to single crystal alloys for high stress, high temperature application under conditions of long and continuous operation and to turbine blades cast from the alloys. Alloys of this type are particularly essential in turbine blade technology in which resistance to oxidation and high temperature corrosion combined with high thermal fatigue and high creep strengths are essential. These alloys are commonly referred to as superalloys . The concept of alloys for casting single crystal parts was developed several years ago and its development can in part be followed in United States Patents 3 494 709, 4 116 723 and 4 209 348. In addition to the alloys, process technology has been developed for the casting of single crystal alloy parts which prevent the growth of all grain structures except one. The techniques involve d in such technology are not part of this invention, rather the invention being the development of an alloy which can be used with such techniques. In the making of single crystal alloy parts, the part is first cast from an alloy suitable for single crystal technology. Process methods are employed during casting solidification to ensure only one grain forms in the mould cavity, which in fact, forms the part being cast such as a turbine blade. The resulting single crystal casting will, however, not be homogeneous because of substantial coring Cdendritic segregation of some of its elements.To eliminate this condition, the casting is subsequently heat treated. In so doing the casting must be heated to a sufficiently high temperature where all of the primary gamma prime strengthening precipitate and some of the eutectic goes into solution. This temperature, however, must be below that at which the casting starts to melt, i.e. the incipient melting point. The temperature range at which this can be accomplished may be called the heat treatment window . The wider the window , the greater the possibility that the heat treatment will be successful in solutioning all the primary gamma prime and some of the eutectic without incipient melting occurring. To the extent that there is a failure to solution all of the primary gamma prime in the final casting, there will be a reduction in high temperature strength.If the incipient melting point is reached, there will be a loss of ductility and likelihood of premature creep or fatigue failure due to void formation. The single crystal alloys heretofore developed, have all had undesirable characteristics. If they had the desired resistance to high temperature fatigue and creep coupled with good oxidation and corrosion resistance, they had such a narrow heat treatment window that they were virtually impractical to heat treat on a production basis and lacked dependable repeatability.When it was attempted to widen the heat treatment window , one of the alloys developed high temperature phase instability which resulted in the formation of plate like acicular phase of alphatungsten, alphachromium and mu phase. This has been found to be a progressive condition resulting in deterioration of long time creep and fatigue properties, once the formation of these conditions has been initiated. The invention creates new alloys which have been proven by tests to develop a relatively wide window , in the range of at least four to five times as wide as any previously obtained without sacrifice of the operating characteristics essential to maximum performance including creep strength and resistance to thermal fatigue, corrosion and oxidation. Microscopic examination reveals a higher degree of homogenization than heretofore obtained coupled with resistance to high temperature formation of deleterious phase precipitates such as alphatungsten, alphachromium and mu. These characteristics stem in part from the widening of the window and in part from an alloy formulation which stabilizes the casting against high temperature, high stress deleterious phase precipitation. Figure 1 is a photomicrograph taken at l00X of a section in the as cast condition taken from a single crystal turbine blade cast from the alloy of this invention Figure 1A is a photomicrograph of the same section taken at 400X Figure 2 is a photomicrograph taken at lOOX of a section of an identical turbine blade after solution heat treatment Figure 2A is a photomicrograph of the same section as Figure 2 taken at 400X and Figure 3 is a graph comparing the high temperature I stress characteristics of the NasAir 100 alloy with those of the alloy of this invention. In prepararing the alloy of this invention, the concept of eliminating the so called grain boundary strengthening elements has been retained from earlier known, single crystal alloys. Thus, to the extent possible, carbon, zirconium, hafnium and boron have been eliminated. However, the remaining elements have been rebalanced resulting in a formulation which has simultaneously eliminated both the problem of an excessively narrow heat treatment window and the problem of high temperature phase instability. The following single crystal alloy has been developed from first principles, the composition being expressed as percentage of weight Co Cr Mo W Ta Al Ti Ni 5 10 0 4 12 5 1.5 Bal This alloy proved to have the requisite properties of creep strength, corrosion resistance, resistance to thermal fatigue and oxidation. However, it has proven to be very difficult to utilize because it reportedly has a heat treatment window limited to a range of 5 degrees to 15 degrees C. Thus, in heat treating this alloy to solution the primary gamma prime, the recommended solution temperature is 128cOr 2.7 C, a virtually impossible range to maintain in production even with very sophisticated equipment. Thus, the rejection rate of the heat treated castings due to incipient melting has been excessive. To overcome the restrictions imposed by the excessively narrow heat treatment window of the above initial single crystal alloy, the MAR M 247 alloy was modified by AiResearch Manufacturing Co. Starting out with the equiaxe and directional casting DS alloy known to the trade as MAR M 247 having the composition by percentage of weight Co Cr Mo W Ta Al Ti Hf C Ni 10 8.2 0.6 10 3 5.5 1.0 1.5 .16 BalAiResearch produced a single crystal alloy having a heat treatment window of a practical range. This alloy, known as NasAir 100, had the composition expressed as percentage of weight Co Cr Mo W Ta Al Ti Ni 0 9 1 10.5 3.3 5.75 1.2 Bal The resulting alloy had the desired heat treatment window range but upon exposure to high thermal and stress conditions it proved to be unstable. Under these conditions deleterious plate like and acicular formations of alphatungsten and mu and to a lesser.degree alphachromium began to appear. These rapidly multiplied to a point such that the thermal fatigue resistance and long term creep strength were materially adversely affected.The thermal phase instability of this alloy will eliminate its utility as a superalloy. The results of these alloy compositions have, in effect, limited the single crystal alloys intended for usage in situations which approach the outer parameters of thermal stress operation to those castings of the initial, single crystal alloy which managed to survive the heat treatment process. After many months of analysis and study of the causes and related effects of the prior single crystal alloy compositions, and using MAR M 247 as the base composition, it was believed that certain heretofore accepted metallurgical concepts in this field were not entirely valid. It had been considered that at least one percent of molybdenum was necessary to maintain the characteristic of a wide window but the presence of this element at this level was considered to be one of the significant factors in creating phase instability mu contains Mo and W in this type of grain boundary free casting. It was discovered that a half percent of molybdenum could be added to maintain the wide heat treatment without encountering the instability problem.Further, a relatively high tungsten content was considered essential to provide strength and a high chromium content to provide corrosion resistance. It was determined by experimentation that the quantities of both of these elements could be reduced and substituted with tantalum, without loss of the desired strength and oxidation corrosion resistance characteristics at the upper extreme of the alloy s operating range This substitution of Ta for W and Cr was also hoped to further improve the alloy s stability, i.e. prevent alphatungsten and alphachromium and mu phase formation. Later tests established the success of this substitution. Cobalt was also added to increase the alloys solid solubility.Aluminium and titanium contents were left at the same levels as in MAR M 247 alloy. The result of this work was an alloy of the following composition expressed as percentage of weight Co Cr Mo W Ta Al Ti Ni 4.6 7.8 0.5 8.0 6.0 5.6 1.0 Bal Subsequent metallographic tests with this alloy have proved it has a gamma prime solvus sufficiently lower than the alloy s incipient melting point to provide a practical heat treatment window of 22 degrees to 28 degrees C. At the same time other tests have established its phase stability and its resistance to the formation of deleterious plate like acicular precipitates during long term exposure at high temperatures. Turbine blade castings were made from this alloy using the single crystal casting technique. These castings were solution heat treated at 13150 C with a final gas fan quench, at which temperature all of the primary gamma prime went into solution, along with much of the eutectic. The change in the microstructure of the alloy is clearly shown by comparing Figures 1 and 1A withFigures 2 and 2A. It is apparent from Figure 1A taken at 400X before heat treatment that the primary gamma prime is non uniform in both distribution and shape and is relatively large sized. After heat treatment the primary gamma prime has been rendered small and basically uniform in both size and shape..The gas fan quench results in the very fine gamma prime size of 0.2 0.3 2 The result is a casting of uniform very fine gamma prime structure capable of developing and maintaining its maximum potential of strength and durability under high thermal stress environments. The experimentation which has been done to date indicates the following to be the composition range in which this alloy can be made Table I Expressed as percentage of weight Min. Max. OptimumCo 4.3 4.9 4.6Cr 7.5 8.2 7.8 Mo 0.3 0.7 0.5W 7.6 8.4 8.0Ta 5. 8 6.2 6.0Al 5.45 5.75 5.6Ti 0.8 1.2 1.0Ni Bal Bal BalC 60 ppm max.Zr 50 ppm max.Hf 50 ppm max.B 30 ppm max.S 20 ppm max.Si 400 ppm max. It will be seen from Table I that the alloy of this invention is very narrow in composition range and any variation from this narrow range could lead to substantial loss of functional characteristics. While it would be desirable to totally eliminate the C, Zr, Hf, B and S elements, this is impractical because they become incorporated in trace amounts either as impurities with the primary elements or from the equipment used in processing the alloy such as the lining of melting furnaces and like vessels which must necessarily be used in making and handling the alloy. EXAMPLE I Single crystal, solid jet engine turbine blades having a section thickness of 3.175 mm were cast using the Jetshapes exothermic process from an alloy fromHeat VF 267 within the range set out in Table I. This alloy had a practical heat treatment window of 22 to 28 degrees C and an incipient melting point of 1329.4 1332.2 C. These blades were heat treated at the VacHyde Process Corp., Los Angeles, California. They were solutioned three hours at 1315 0C and then gas fan quenched, treated five hours at 9820C followed by twenty hours at 8710C. At Joliet Metallurgical Labs. specimens 1.778 mm in diameter were machined from the longitudinal direction 001 crystallographic orientation of the blade. These were then tested for high temperature stress rupture with the following results Specimen No. Test Conditions Time to Failure in Hours 2 o 1. 5.58 Kg cm at 9 72.7 2 o 2. 5.58 Kg cm at 982 C 69.2 2 o 3. 2.79 Kg cm at 1093 C 98.2 2 4. 2.79 Kg cm at 1093 C 97.6 5. 5.58 Kg cm2 at 982 C 69.9 6. 5.58 Kg cm2 at 982 C 69.9 2 0 7. 8.53 Kg cm at 871 C 529.1 8. 8.53 Kg cm2 at 8710C 498.7 20 hour 8710C aging cycle deleted. Microscopic examination of the specimens taken from blades cast from the same heat disclosed the same uniform fine gamma prime structure shown in Figures 2 and 2A. EXAMPLE II From the same heat VF 267 as Example I, 9.525 mm diameter, single crystal bars were cast using a European withdrawal process. Specimens 2.26 mm diameter were machined from the longitudinal section 001 crystallographic orientation after a solution heat treatment of three hours at 1315 C, then air cooled and treated five hours at 982 0C and an additional twenty hours at 8710C to age. These were then tested for high temperature stress rupture with the following results Specimen No.Test Conditions Time to Failure in Hours 2 16.41 Kg cmê 0 1. 16.41 Kg cmê at 7 781 2. 16.41 Kg cm2 at 760 C 882 2 at 0 3. 16.41 Kg cm at 760 C 708 2 0 263 4. 11.24 Kg cm2 at 850 C C 5. 11.24 Kg cm2 at 850 C 252 6. 11.24 Kg cm2 at 850 C 228 2 140 C 0 7. 2.88 Kg cm at 1040 C 388 8. 2.88 Kg cm2 at 1040 C 378 9. 2.88 Kg cm2 at 1040 C 420 The results of the tests reported in the two preceding examples are compared graphically in Figure 3 with similar tests performed on the NasAir 100 alloy. It is apparent from these tests that the alloy of this invention has a small improvement in stress rupture strength over NasAir 100. However, it retains the wide heat treatment window without loss of alloy stability. Single crystal specimens of the alloy, in the as cast condition have been aged for 1000 hours at 850 C, 949 0C and 10490C. Microscopic examination of all the aged specimens revealed no phase instability. Similar tests were conducted on two additional heats VF 312 and VF 332 with similar results, confirming the repeatability of results using this alloy. It will be recognized that this is an alloy which must be both manufactured and cast under high vacuum conditions. This is essential to avoid gaseous contaminants such as oxygen and nitrogen. It is also essential to use specialized vessels to prevent contamination from such materials as C, B, Si, Zr and others which will enter an alloy from its container. The invention provides the first microstructurally stable, single crystal alloy having heat treat window characteristics which make it possible to obtain satisfactory castings without an excessive rejection rate.As such, this invention makes very high performance, single crystal single grain castings a practical and producible product rather than a product too costly for all but the most exotic applications.
