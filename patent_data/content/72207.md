# Extrusion of copper.

## Abstract
In a continuous friction actuated process for the extru sion of copper, a passageway 3 is formed between an arcuate first member and a second member in the form of a wheel 1 having a circumferential groove 2 formed in its peripheral sur face into which groove the first member projects. The wheel is rotated and metal is fed into the passageway at one end and extrudes from the passageway through at least one die orifice 6 located in or adjacent to an abutment member 5 extending across the passageway at the other end thereof. The abutment member is of substantially smaller cross section than the pas sageway so as to leave a substantial gap between the abut ment member and the groove. Particulate copper is first fed under such conditions that at least a substantial proportion of the copper extrudes through the clearance y between the abutment and the groove surface and adheres to the wheel un til the copper so extruded forms a complete lining 8 in the groove, and thereafter copper rod is fed for the remainder of the extrusion operation.
