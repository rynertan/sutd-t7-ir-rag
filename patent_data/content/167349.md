## Description
META SUBSTITUTED DIOXA ALRANE CARBOXYLIC ACIDS, ESTERS,AMIDES AND SALTS OF DIPHENYL ETHERS This invention is concerned with meta substituted dioxa alkane carboxylic acids, esters, amides and salts of diphenyl ethers which are novel herbicidal compounds, compositions containing them and methods of controlling weeds using them. Certain diphenyl ethers have been shown to be effective agents for controlling weeds. The herbicidal effectiveness of a given diphenyl ether, however, cannot be predicted from an examination of the substituent groups attached to the phenyl ring in the ether. Frequently, closely related compounds will demonstrate quite different weed control capabilities. Various diphenyl ethers may overlap or have complementary areas of activity or selectivity, and therefore be useful in combination to control a variety of weeds upon application of a single composition. Furthermore, previously known diphenyl ethers are not completely effective. An ideal herbicide should provide selective weed control over its full growing season with a single administration at low dosages of application. It should be able to control all common weeds by killing them as the seed, the germinating seed, the seedling, and the growing plant. At the same time, the herbicide should not by phytotoxic to the crops to which it is applied and should decompose or otherwise dissipate so as not to poison the soil permanently. The known diphenyl ether herbicides fall short of these ideals. It would be desirable to have new herbicides which show even more selective control of undesirable plants among desirable crop plants or which complement the known diphenyl ethers in activity. This invention provides diphenyl ethers which have the formula EMI2.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen, halogen chloro, fluoro, bromo or iodo , nitro or cyano R2 is halogen chloro, fluoro, bromo or iodo , trifluoromethyl or cyano R3 is hydrogen, nitro, halogen chloro, fluoro, bromo or iodo , cyanc, or Cl C4 alkylthio, Cl C4 alkylsulfinyl or C1 C4 alkvlsulfonyl R4 is hydrogen or C1 C4 straight or branched chain alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, n or i propyl and n or s butyl R5 is hydrogen or C1 C4 straight or branched chain alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, n or i propyl and n or s butyl R6 is cyano or carboxy or an agronomically acceptable salt, ester or amide thereof n is an integer of one to four and m is an integer of one to four. In this specification the term lower as applied to an alkyl group means C1 C4 . We have found the novel compounds of the present invention to show unexpected activity as weed control agents. Preferred embodiments of the invention include those wherein one or more of the following individual preference apply RÚ is halogen, particularly preferred is chloro R2 is trifluoromethyl R3 is nitro or halogen fluoro, chloro or bromo being particularly preferred R4 is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl R5 is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl R6 is a carbalkoxy group Co2R7 where R7 is a lower C1 C4 straight or branched chain alkyl substituent n is an integer of one, two or three and m is one or two. Examples of the compounds of the invention embraced by Formula I include 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1,4 diox2 5 carbomethOxy n hexyl diphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1,4 dioxa 5 carbomethOxy n hexyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1 ,4 dioxa 5 carbomethoxy n hexyl 4 bromodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1,4 dioxa 5 carboethoxy n hexyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1,4 dioxa 3 methyl 5 carbomethoxy n hexyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1,4 dioxa 5 carboxy n hexyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1,4 dioxa 3 methyl 5 carbomethoxy n pentyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1,4 dioxa 3 methyl 5 carbomethoxy n pentyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1, 3 dioxa 4 carbomethoxy n pentyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifllloromethyl 3 1,4 dioxa 5 carbomethOxy n pentyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1,4 dioxa 5 cyano n heXyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1,4 dioxa 5 carboethoxy n pentyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1, 5 dioxa 6 carbomethoxy n hexyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1,4 dioxa 5 carboiso propoxy n pentyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl fl , 5 dioxa 6 carbomethoxy n heptyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1, 4 dioxa 5 carbomethoxy n heptyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1,4 dioxa 5 carboiso propoxy n hexyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1,4 dioxa 5 carbomethOxy n pentyl 4 bromodiphenyl ether 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1,4 dioxa 5 carbomethoxy n pentyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 nitro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1,4 dioxa carbomethOxy n pentyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 cyano 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1,4 dioxa 5 carbomethOxy n pentyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2t4 dichloro 3 1,4 dioxa 5 carbomethoxy n pentyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 cyano 3 1,4 dioxa 5 carbomethoxy n pentyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1,4 dioxa 5 carbomethOxy n pentyl 4 fluorodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1, 4 dioxa 5 carbomethoxy n pentyl 4 cyanodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1,3 dioxa 4 carbomethOxy n butyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1,4 dioxa 2,3 dimethyl 5 carbomethoxy n pentyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1, 4 dioxa 5 carbomethoxy n pentyl 4 methylthio diphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1, 4 dioxa 5 carbomethoxy n pentyl 4 methylsulfinyl diphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1, 4 dioxa 5 carbomethoxy n pentyl 4 methylsulfonyl diphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1, 4 dioxa 5 carbomethoxy n pentyl diphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 f1,4 dioxa 5 carboxamide n pentyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1,4 dioxa 5 carboxamide n hexyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1, 4 dioxa 5 N,N dimethylcarboxamide n penthyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 1,3 dioxa 2 methyl 4 carbomethoxy n butyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether. When the R6 substituent is carboxamide CONR8R9 , R8 and R9 are independently a hydrogen atom, straight or branched chain alkyl having up to 4 carbon atoms or straight or branched chain alkoxy having up to 4 carbon atoms. When the R 6 substituent is, or contains, a carboxy group, either the free acid or the salt form can be used.Typical salts are the agronomically acceptable metal salts or ammonium salts. Among the suitable metal salts are those in which the metal cation is an alkali metal cation, such as sodium, potassium or lithium an alkaline earth metal cation, such as calcium, magnesium, barium or strontium, or a heavy metal cation, such as zinc, manganese, cupric, cuprous, ferric, ferrous, titanium or aluminum. Particularly preferred salts include sodium, potassium and ammonium.Among the suitable ammonium salts are those in which the ammonium cation has the formula NWXYZ, wherein each of W, X,Y and Z is, independently, a hydrogen atom, a hydroxy group, a C1 C4 alkoxy group, a C1 C20 alkvl group, a C3 C8 alkenyl group, a C3 C8 alkynyl group, a C2 C8 hydroxyalkyl group, a C2 C8 alkoxyalkyl group, a C2 C6 aminoalkyl group, a C2 C6 haloalkyl group, an amino group, a C1 C4 alkyl or di C1 C4 alkylamino group, a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted phenylalkyl group, having up to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety, or any two of W, X, Y or Z can be taken together to form with the nitrogen atom a 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic ring, optionally having up to one additional hetero oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur atom in the ring, and preferably saturated, such as a piperidine, morpholino, pyrrolidino, or piperazino ring, or any three of W, X, Y or Z can be taken together to form with the nitrogen atom a 5 or 6 membered aromatic heterocyclic ring, such as a piperazole or pyridine ring. When the ammonium group contains a substituted phenyl or substituted phenylalkyl group, the substituents will generally be selected from halogen atoms, C1 C8 alkyl groups, C1 C4 alkoxy groups, hydroxy groups, nitro groups, trifluoromethyl groups, cyano groups, amino groups, C1 C4 alkylthio groups, and the like. Such substituted phenyl groups preferably have up to two such substituents.Representative ammonium cations include ammonium, dimethylammonium, 2 ethylhexylammonium, bis 2 hydroxyethyl ammonium, tris 2 hydrox.yethyl ammonium, dicyclohexylammonium, t octylammonium, 2 hydroxyethylammonium, morpholinium, piperidinium, 2 phenethylammonium, 2 methylbenzylammonium, n hexylammonium, triethylammonium, trimethylammonium, tri n butyl ammonium, methoxyethylammonium, diisopropylammonium, pyridinium, dialkylammonium, pyrazolium, propargylammonium, dimethylhydrazinium, octadecylammonium, 4 dichlorophenylammonium, 4 nitrobenzylammonium, benzyltrimethylammonium, 2 hydroxyethyldimethyloctadecylammonium, 2 hydroxyethyldiethyloctylammonium, decyltrimethylammonium, hexyltriethylammonium and 4 methylbenzyltrimethylammonium. The novel compounds of the invention are useful both as preemergence and as postemergence herbicides. Preemergence herbicides are ordinarily used to treat the soil in which the desired crop is to be planted by application either before seeding, during seeding or, as in most applications, after seeding and before the crop emerges.Postemergence herbicides are those which are applied after the crop plants have emerged and during their growth period. The novel compounds of the present invention may be advantageously employed as weed killers in crops of both monocots and dicots and are particularly active against broadleaf weeds postemergence. Diphenyl ethers of the invention are useful for controlling weeds in rice crops. When used in transplanted rice crops, the ethers can be applied either preemergence or postemergence to the weeds that is, they can be applied to the growth medium of the transplanted plants either before the weed plants have emerged cr while they are in an early stage of growth. The ethers can be applied to the growth medium either before or after the rice has been transplanted to that medium. The diphenyl ethers of the invention may be applied in any amount which will give the required control of weeds.A preferred rate of application is from about 0.01 to 2.24 kg ha 0.01 to 2 lb acre and especially preferred from 0.056 to 0.56 kg ha 0.05 to 0.5 pounds per acre of the active diphenyl ether of the invention. Under some conditions, the diphenyl ethers of the invention may advantageously be incorporated into the soil or other growth medium prior to planting a crop. This incorporation can be carried out by any convenient means, including by simply mixing with the soil, by applying the diphenyl ether to the surface of the soil and then disking or dragging into the soil to the desired depth, or by employing a liquid carrier to accomplish the necessary penetration and impregnation. A diphenyl ether of the invention can be applied to the growth medium or to plants to be treated either by itself, or, as is generally done, as a component in a herbicidal composition or formulation which also comprises an agronomically acceptable carrier. By agronomically acceptable carrier we mean for example any substance which can be used to dissolve, disperse or diffuse a herbicidal compound in the composition without impairing the effectiveness of the herbidical compound and which by itself has no detrimental effect on the soil, equipment, crops, or agronomic environment. Mixtures cf the diphenyl ethers of the present invention may also be used in any of these herbicidal formulations. The herbicidal compositions of the invention can be either solid or liquid formulations or solutions.For example, the diphenyl ethers can be formulated as wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, dusts, granular formulations, aerosols or flowable emulsion concentrates. In such formulations, the compounds are extended with a liquid or solid carrier and, when desired, suitable surfactants are incorporated. It is usually desirable, particularly in postemergence applications, to include adDuvants such as wetting agents, spreading agents, dispersing agents, sticking agents, adhesives and the like, in accordance with agricultural practices. Examples of adjuvants which are commonly used in the art can be found in the John W.McCutcheon, Inc. publication Detergents and EmulsifiersAnnual . The diphenyl ethers of this invention can be dissolved in any appropriate solvent. Examples of solvents which are useful in the practice of this invention include alcohols, ketones, aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, dimethylformamide, dioxane and dimethyl sulfoxide. Mixtures of these solvents can also be used. The concentration of the active ingredient in the solution will usually be from 2 to 98 with a preferred range being 25 to 75 , by weight. Fdr the preparation of emulsifiable concentrates, the diphenyl ether can be dissolved in organic solvent such as toluene, xylene, methylated naphthalene, corn oil, pine oil, o dichlorobenzene, isophorone, cyclohexanone and or methyl oleate, together with an emulsifying agent which permits dispersion in water. Suitable emulsifiers include, for example, the ethylene oxide derivatives of alkylphenols or long chain alcohols, mercaptans, carboxylic acids, and reactive amines and partially esterified polyhydric alcohols. Solvent soluble sulfates or sulfonates, such as the alkaline earth salts or amine salts of alkylbenzenesulfonates and the fatty alcohol sodium sulfates, having surface active properties can he used as emulsifiers either alone or in conjunction with an ethylene oxide reaction product.Flowable emulsion concentrates are formulated similarly to the emu sifiable concentrates and include, in addition to the above components, water and a stabilizing agent such as a water scluble cellulose derivative or a water soluble salt of a polyacrylic acid. The concentration of the active ingredient in emulsifiable concentrates is usually 10 to 60 and in flowable emulsion concentrates, this can be as high as 75, by weight. Wettable powders suitable for spraying can be prepared by admixing the compound with a finely divided solid, such as clays, inorganic silicates and carbonates, and silicas and incorporating wetting agents, sticking agents, and or dispersing agents in such mixtures. The concentration of active ingredients in such formulations is usually 20 to 98 , preferably 40 to 75 by weight. A dispersing agent can constitute about 0.5 to about 38 of the composition, and a wetting agent can constitute from about 0.1 to about 5 of the composition, by weight. Dusts can be prepared by mixing the compounds of the invention with finely divided inert solids which may be organic or inorganic in nature. Materials useful for this purpose include, for example, botanical flours, silicas, silicates, carbonates and clays. One convenient method of preparing a dust is to dilute a wettable powder with a finely divided carrier. Dust concentrates containing 20 to 80 of active ingredient are commonly made and subsequently diluted to 1 to 10 , by weight, use concentration. Granular formulations can be prepared by impregnating a solid such as granular Fuller s earth, vermiculite, ground corn cobs, seed hulls, including bran or other grain hulls, or similar material. A solution of one or more of the diphenyl ethers of the present invention in a volatile organic solvent can be sprayed or mixed 7ith the granular solid and the solvent then removed by evaporation. The granular material my be of any suitable size, with a preferred size range of about 1.19 mm to 0.25 mm 16 to 60 mesh . The diphenyl ether will usually comprise about 2 to about 15 by weight of the qranular formulation. The diphenyl ethers of the present invention can also be mixed with fertilizers or fertilizing materials before their application. In one type of solid fertilizing composition in which the diphenyl ethers may be used, particles of a fertilizer or fertilizing ingredients, such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, or ammonium phosphate can be coated with one or more of the ethers. The solid diphenyl ether and solid fertilizing material may also be admixed in blending or mixing equipment, or they can be incorporated with fertilizers in granular formulations. Any relative proportion of diphenyl ether and fertilizer can be used which is suitable for the crops and weeds to be treated. The diphenyl ether will commonly be from about 5 to about 25 by weight of the fertilizing composition.These compositions provide fertilizing materials which promote the rapid growth of desired plants, while at the same time control the growth of undesired plants. The diphenyl ethers of the present invention may be applied as herbicidal sprays by methods commonly employed, such as conventional high gallonage hydraulic sprays, low gallonage sprays, airblast spray, aerial sprays, and dusts.If low volume applications are desired, a solution of the compound is usually used. The dilution and rate of application will usually depend upon such factors as the type of equipment employed, method of application, area to be treated and the type and stage of development of the weeds.

The diphenyl ethers of the present invention, or their precursors, are preferably prepared by reacting a suitably substituted diphenyl ether phenol of Formula II EMI15.1 wherein RÚ, Rê and R are as defined for Formula I, which are known compounds in a polar aprotic organic solvent and in the presence of an acid acceptor, with a compound ofFormula IIIEMI15.2 wherein Hal is halogen, preferably chlorine or bromine and 4 R5, R6, n and m are as defined for Formula I. Examples of suitable bases for the above reaction include KOH, K2CO3, triethylamine and the like. This reaction is generally carried out at a temperature of 25 C to 2000C, preferably 850C to 1500C. Another method for preparing the diphenyl ethers ofFormula I is by reacting a suitably substituted diphenyl ether alcohol of Formula IVEMI15.3 in a polar aprotic organic solvent and in the presence of an acid acceptor with a compound of Formula VEMI15.4 wherein Hal is halogen, preferably chlorine or bromine andR5 R6 and m are as defined for Formula I. Examples of suitable bases for the above reaction include NaH and potassium tert butoxide. This reaction is generally carried out at a temperature of from 30 C to OOC. The above reactions are suitably conducted in the presence of polar aprotic organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, l methyl 2 pyrrolidone, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl formamide, etc. The reaction temperatures are in the range of 30 C to 2000C and the reaction time from about 1 hour to several days, depending on the starting material, reaction temperatures and solvent. The reaction is usually carried out under normal pressure. Another method for preparing the diphenyl ethers ofFormula I is by reacting a suitably substituted diphenyl ether alcohol of Formula IV in a nonprotic organic solvent, such as methylene chloride, and optionally, but preferably, in the presence of a catalyst such as copper with an alkyl diazo compound having the formula VI EMI16.1 wherein R5, R6 and m are as defined for Formula I. Diphenyl ethers prepared by the above techniques can also be used as precursors in preparing compounds of the invention. For example, compounds of the invention in which R 6 is or includes an ester may be converted by conventional techniques to the corresponding carboxylic acids and amides or alternative carbalkoxy compounds. In addition, compounds of the invention can be made by nitration of suitable precursors without a nitro group prepared by the above techniques. The compounds of Formula III can be prepared by reacting a suitably substituted alcohol with a suitable aldehyde in the presence of an acid door, such as hydrochloric acid. The diphenyl ether alcohol of Formula IV can be prepared by at least two methods, depending upon the desired 4R substituent and n. For example, a suitably substituted diphenyl ether phenol of Formula II is reacted in a polar aprotic organic solvent and in the presence of a suitable acid acceptor such as KOH, K2CO3, triethylamine and the like with a halo alcohol. Alternatively, a suitably substituted diphenyl ether phenol of Formula II is reacted in a polar aprotic organic solvent and in the presence of a suitable acid acceptor such as KOH, K2 CO3 or triethylamine with an alpha halocarbonyl derivative and then reduced in a suitable solvent with a suitable reducing agent to obtain the compounds of FormulaIV. Examples of solvents include tetrahydrofuran and alcohols such as methanol or ethanol. Examples of reducing agents include borane dimethyl sulfide complex and sodium borohydride. The reactions described above for preparing the compounds of Formula IV are generally carried out in polar aprotic organic solvents similar to those previously described. The salts of the invention can be prepared by any convenient art recognised method, such as by reacting a metal hydroxide, a metal hydride, or an amine or ammonium salt, such as a halide, hydroxide or alkoxide with the free acid, or reacting a quaternary ammonium salt, such as a chloride, a bromide or nitrate with a metal salt of the invention in a suitable solvent. When metal hydroxides are used as reagents, useful solvents include water, glyme, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and the like. When metal hydrides are used as reagents, useful solvents include nonhydroxylic solvents such as dioxane, glyme, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, hydrocarbons, including toluene, xylene, hexane, pentane, heptane, and octane, dimethylformamide, and the like.When amines are used as reagents, useful solents include alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol, hydrocarbons, such as toluene, xylene and hexane, tetrahydrofuran, glyme, dioxane, or water. When ammonium salts are used as reagents, useful solvents include water, alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol, glyme, tetrahydrofuran, or the like. When the ammonium salt is other than a hydroxide or alkoxide, an additional base, such as potassium or sodium hydroxide, hydride, or alkoxide is generally used. The particular choice of solvent will depend on the relative solubilities of the starting materials and the resultant salts, and slurries rather than solutions of certain reagents may be used to obtain the salts.Generally, equivalent amounts of the starting reagents are used and the salt forming reaction is carried out at about OOC to about 1000C, preferably at about room temperature. There should also be mentioned as preferred compounds all of the individual compounds of Formula I hereinbefore and hereinafter disclosed, varied by replacement of one or more of the substituents therein according to one or more of the options given in the list below. Furthermore this list, when one or more of the options in it is applied to the general Formula I, defines further groups of preferred compounds. The list is as follows a for RÚ chlorine b for Rê trifluoromethyl c for R bromine, trifluoromethyl, nitro d for R4 hydrogen, methyl, ethyl e for R5 hydrogen, methyl, ethyl f for R6 carbalkoxy CO2R7 , carboxamide CO2NR8R9 g for R7 C1 C3 straight or branched chain alkyl h for R8 hydrogen C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy i for R hydrogen Cl C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy.

Seeds of selected weeds are planted in soil in flats and covered with 1.3 cm 0.5 inch of a 3 1 soil sand mixture. For preemergence tests, immediately after planting, the test compound is sprayed directly onto the soil surface. The flats are then watered by subirrigation and overhead.Subsequently, only overhead watering is used. For postemergence tests, the seeds are allowed to germinate and after about two weeks the flats are treated with the test compound. The flats for postemergence tests are watered by subirrigation only. The compound to be evaluated was dissolved in about 5.0 ml of 50 50 acetone methanol solution with 0.05 weight by volume of an alkylaryl polyether alcohol surfactant Triton X 114, commercially available from Rohm and HaasCo. . This solution is then diluted with about 20 ml of acetone and sprayed over the flats using a carrier volume equivalent to 76.5 l ha 50 gallons per acre at a 0.56 kg ha 0.5 pounds per acre rate of application. About two weeks after application of the test compound, the state of growth of the plant is observed.
