## Description
6 alpha HydroxymethyIpenicillanic Acid Sulfone As a beta lactamase Inhibitor One of the most well known and widely used class of antibacterial agents are the so called beta lactam antibiotics These compounds are characterized in that they have a nucleus consisting of a 2 azetidinone beta lactam ring fused to either a thiazolidine or a dihydro 1,3 thiazine ring, When the nucleus contains a thiazolidine ring, the compounds are usually referred to generically as penicillins, whereas when the nucleus contains a dihydrothiazine ring, the compounds are referred to as cephalosporins.Typical examples of penicillins which areacommonly used in clinical practice are benzylpenicillin pencillin G , phenoxymethylpenicillin penicillin V , ampicillin and carbenicillin typical examples of common cephalosporins are cephalothin, cephalexin and cefazolin. However, despite the wide use and wide acceptance of the beta lactam antibiotics as valuable chemotherapeutic agents, they suffer from the major drawback that certain members are not active against certain microorganisms. it is thought that in many instances this resistance of a particular microorganism to a given beta lactam antibiotic results because the microorganism produces a beta lactamaseThe latter substances are enzymes which cleave the betalactam ring of penicillins and cephalosporins to give products which are devoid of antibacterial activity.However, certain substances have the ability to inhibit beta lactamases, and when a beta lactamase inhibitor is used in combination with a pencillin or cephalosporin it can increase or enhance the antibacterial effectiveness of the penicillin or cephalosporin against certain beta lactamase producing microorganisms. It is considered that there is an enhancement of antibacterial effectiveness when the antibacterial activity of a combination of beta lactamase inhibiting substance and a betalactam antibiotic is significantly greater than the sum of the antibacterial activities of the individual components against beta lactamase producing microorganisms, The present invention relates to alpha hydroxymethyl penicillanic acid sulfone which is a potent inhibitor of microbial beta lactamases and which enhances the effectiveness of beta lactam antibiotics. The invention further relates to benzyl 6 alpha hydroxymethylpenicillanate sulfone, said ester being a useful chemical intermediate to the corresponding acid Pharmaceutical compositions comprising the above nentioned 6 alpha substituted penicillanic acid with certain beta lactam antibiotics as well as a method for increasing the effectiveness of certain beta lactam antibiotics in combination with the above mentioned alpha substituted penicillanic acid are also parts of the present invention. Di Ninno, et al., J. Orq. Chem., 42, 2960 1977 have reported the synthesis of 6 beta hydroxyalkylpenicillanic acids and the corresponding benzyl esters as potential antibacterial agents and useful intermediates, respectively. 6 Ethylpenicillanic acid and its sulfoxide derivatives are claimed as antibiotics in U.S. Patent 4,123,539. 6 alpha Hydroxypenicillanic acid and esters thereof have been prepared from 6 diazopenicillanic acid and the corresponding esters J. Org. Chew,, 39 1444 1974 1. U.S Patent 4,143,046 discloses 6 beta substituted sulfonyloxypenicillanic acids as antibacterial agents, andU.S. Patent 4,287,181 claims a series of 6 beta l hydroxyalkyl penicillanic acid sulfones as potent beta lactamase inhibitors.

The 6 alpha hydroxymethylpenicillanic acid sulfone of the present application offers several advantages over the 6 beta hydroxymethylpenicillanic acid sulfone of U.S. Patent 4,287,181. The beta lactamase inhibitor of the present invention is a crystalline compound as opposed to the amorphous character of the 6 beta hydroxyalkylpenicillanic acid sulfones of the above mention U.S. patent. Amorphous compounds are, in general, less desirable than is a crystalline form from the standpoint of preparation, storage and use. A crystalline compound is considerably more stabile than an amorphous form of a compound, and resists decomposing and discoloration For pharmaceutical use, it is much easier to make up a particular dosage form using a crystalline compound as opposed to an amorphous compound. Finally, amorphous forms of a compound are frequently more hygroscopic than the crystalline form In addition, the 6 alpha hydroxyrnethylpenicillanic acid sulfone of the present invention possesses less inherent antibacterial activity thus resulting in a greater synergistic effect when combined with a beta lactam antibiotic. Finally, it is well known in the art that most 6substituted penicillanic acids possessing beta lactamase activity are of the beta configuration. The finding of a beta lactamase inhibitor of the potency and spectrum of activity of the compound of the present invention with the alpha configuration is unusual, if not unique. While the present invention relates to 6 alphahydroxymethylpenicillanic acid sulfone and useful base salts and esters thereof, it is also meant to embrace compounds of the formula EMI7.1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable base salt thereof, whereinR is alkylsulfonyloxymethyl having one to four carbon atoms in the alkyl group, phenylsulfonyloxymethyl, substituted phenysulfonyloxymethyl wherein said substitutent is methyl, methoxy, fluoro, chloro, bromo or trifluoromethyl or 1 hydroxy 3 phenylpropyl R1 is benzyl, hydrogen or esterforming residues readily hydrolyzable in vivc and R2 isEMI8.1 wherein R3 is sulfo, hydrogen, alkoxycdrbonyl of two to four carbon atoms, alkanoyl of two to eighteen carbon atoms, benzoyl, substituted benzoyl wherein said substituent is amino, methyl, methoxy, fluoro, chloro, bromo or trifluoro methyl, alkylsulfonyl of one to four carbon atoms, phenylsulfonyl or substituted phenylsulfonyl wherein said substituent is methyl, methoxy, fluoro, chloro, bromo or tri fluoromethyl, and R4 is hydrogen, alkyl of one to four carbon atoms, phenyl, benzyl, pyridyl or beta phenethyl. The beta lactamase inhibitor of the present invention is conveniently prepared starting with benzyl 6,6 dibromopenicillanate. The condensation of formaldehyde with the enolate formed through the reaction of benzylr 6,6 dibromopenicillanate with an organometallic reagent, such as the process taught by Di Ninno, et al., J. Orq, Chem., 42, 2960 1977 , results in the formation of benzyl 6 bromo 6 hydroxymethylpenicillanate, the initial intermediate leading to the product of the present invention, The product of this initial condensation is comprised of a diastereomeric mixture due to the asymmetric center at the 6 position of the penam nucleus. The substituents at the 6 position are designated as alpha or beta and are so indicated in the structual formula by a broken or solid bond, respectively. The assignment of configuration is based on nuclear magnetic resonance spectros copy. Experimentally, benzyl 6,6 dibromopenicillanate in a reaction inert solvent at 20 to 78 c is treated with about one equivalent of t butyl lithium or t butyl magnesium chloride. The resulting enolate is then treated with formaldehyde and, after a short reaction period, the reaction is quenched and the product isolated by conventional means. The initial reaction is conducted in an anhydrous reactioninert solvent, which appreciably solubilizes the reactants without reacting to any great extent with the reactants or products under reaction conditions. It is preferred that said solvents have boiling points and freezing points compatible with reaction temperatures. Such solvents or mixtures thereof include aromatic solvents such as toluene and ethereal solvents such as tetrahydrofuran and diethyl ether. The molar ratio of the starting penicillanate derivative and the organometallic reagent is not critical to the process.The use of a slight excess of organometallic, up togas much as ten percent above an equimolar quantity, aids in the completion of the reaction and offers no serious problems in isolating the desired product in purified form. Moisture can effectively be kept out of the reaction by employing a nitrogen or argon atmosphere. Reaction time is inherently dependent on concentration, reaction temperature and reactivity of the starting reagents.When the reaction is conducted at the preferred reaction temperature of 60 to 780c. the reaction time for the formation of the enolate is about 30 45 minutes. The reaction time for the formation of the intermediate product from the aforementioned enolate and formaldehyde is about 30 60 minutes. On completion of the reaction, the product is isolated by conventional means and the diastereomeric mixture can be separated by column chromatography. However, the nature of a subsequent reaction, which is the removal of the 6 bromo substituent precludes the necessity for said separation of alpha and beta epimers at C 6. The oxidation of the resulting benzyl 6 bromo 6 hydroxymethylpenicillanate to the corresponding sulfone wherein R is benzyl is conveniently carried out using an organic peroxy acid, e.g., a peroxy carboxylic acid such as mchloroperbenzoic acid. The reaction is carried out by treating benzyl 6 bromo hydroxymethylpencillanate with about 2 to about 4 equivalents and preferably about 2.2 equivalents of the oxidant in a reaction inert solvent, Typical solvents are chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride, chloroform and 1,2 dichloroethane. The oxidant and substrate are initially combined in a solvent at 0 50C. The temperature is allowed to rise to room temperature. Reaction time is about 1 3 hours. During isolation of the sulfone, which is a useful intermediate, the solvent is removed and the residue partitioned between water and a water inmiscible solvent such as ethyl acetate. The pil of the water organic solvent mixture is adjusted to about 7.4 and any excess peroxide can be decomposed with sodium bisulfite. The intermediate product, which is contained in the organic phase, is isolated and purified by conventional means. Treatment of benzyl 6 bromo hydroxymethylpenicil lanate sulfone with a 5 paliadium on calcium carbonate catalyst a a hydrogen atmosphere results in the formation of the desired 6 alpha hydroxymethylpenicillanic acid sulfone. The reaction is conducted at room temperature at an initial hydrogen pressure of about 40 50 psi. At these temperatures and pressures the reaction is usually complete in about 0,5 2 hours. The reaction is carried out in a reaction inert solvent which appreciably solubilizes the pencillanate ester without reaction to any great extent with the reactants or the product under reaction conditions. It is further preferred that said solvent be a protic solvent. The preferred solvent is 508 water methanol. When 58 palladium on calcium carbonate is employed for the reduction debenzylation it is preferred that a. two fold weight ratio of catalyst to starting penicillanate ester reactant be employed initially or in divided portions. On completion of the reaction, the biologically active product of the present invention wherein R1 is hydrogen, is obtained by removal of the methanol, adjustment of the residual aqueous to pE 8.0 with sodium bicarbonate and extraction with a water immiscible solvent such as ethyl acetate, followed by adjustment of the aqueous to a pH of about 2 and extraction with ethyl acetate, Purification is by conventional means such as recrystalization from chloroform ethyl acetate. The compound of the present invention wherein R1 is hydrogen, is acidic and will form salts with basic agents.Such salts are considered to be within the scope of this invention, These salts can be prepared by standard techniques, such as contacting the acidic and basic components, usually in a l lfl1qlar ratio, in an aqueous, non aqueous or partially aqueous medium, as appropriate. They are then recovered by filtration, by evaporation of the solvent, or in the case of aqueous solutions, by lyophilization, as appropriate.Basic agents which are suitably employed in salt formation belong to both the organic and inorganic types, and they include ammonia, organic amines, alkali metal hydroxides, carbonates, bicarbonates, hydrides and alkoxides, as well as alkaline earth metal hydrides, carbonates, hydrides and alkoxidesRepresentative examples of such bases are primary gamines, such as n propylamine, n butylamine, cyclohexylamine, benzylamine and octylamine secondary amines, such as diethylamine, morpholine, pyrrolidine and piperidine tertiary amines, such as triethylamine, N ethylpiperidine, N methylmorpholine and 1,5 diazabicyclo 4.3.0lnon 5 ene hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide and barium hydroxide alkoxides, such as sodium ethoxide and potassium ethoxide hydrides, such as calcium hydride and sodium hydride carbonates, such as potassium carbonate and sodium carbonate bicarbonates, such as sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate and alkali metal salts of long chain fatty acids, such as sodium 2 ethylhexanoate. Preferred salts of the present compound wherein R1 is hydrogen are the sodium, potassium and triethylamine salts, The compound of the present inventionr wherein R1 is hydrogen enhances the antibacterial effectiveness of betalactam antibiotics in vivo. That is, it lowers the amount of the antibiotic which is needed to protect mice against an otherwise lethal innoculum of certain beta lactamase producing bacteria. The ability of the compound of the present invention wherein R1 is hydrogen to enhance the effectiveness of a beta lactam antibiotic against beta lactamase producing bacteria makes them valuable for co administration with . beta lactam antibiotics in. the treatment of bacterial infections in mammals, particularly man In the treatment of a bacterial infection, the said compound can be comingled with the betalactam antibiotic, and the two agents thereby administered simultaneously. Alternatively, the said compound can be administered as a separate agent during the course of treatment with a beta lactam antibirtic. In some instances it will be advantageous to pre dose the subject with the subject compound before initiating treatment with a betalactam antibiotic When using the compound of the present invention whereinR1 is hydrogen to enhance the effectiveness of beta lactam antibiotic, a mixture of said compound with the beta lactam antibiotic is administered preferably in formulation with standard pharmaceutical carriers or diluents. A pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, a beta lactam antibiotic and the compound of the present invention wherein R1 is hydrogen will normally contain from about 5 to about 80 percent of the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier by weight When using 6 alpha hydroxymethylpenicillanic acid sulfone in combination with another beta lactam antibiotic, said compounds can be administered orally or parenterally, i.e., intramuscularly, subcutaneously or intraperitoneal ly. Although the prescribing physician will ultimately decide the dosage to be used in a human subject, the ratio of the daily dosages of the compound of the present invention Rl H and the beta lactam antibiotic will normally be in the range from about 1 3 to 3 1. Additionally, when using said compound in combination with another beta lactam antibiotic, the daily oral dosage of each component will normally be in the range from about 10 to about 200 mg per kilogram of body weight and the daily parenteral dosage of each component will normally be about 10 to about 400 mg per kilogram of body weight. These figures are illustrative only, however, and in some case it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits.

EXAMPLE I 6 alpha Rydroxymethylpenicillanic Acid SulfoneA. benzyl 6 bromo 6 hydroxymethylpenicil lanate A solution of 44.9 g. of benzyl 6,6 dibromopenicillanate in 600 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran was cooled to 780C. and 56.4 ml. of t butylmagnesium chloride was added dropwise with vigorous stirring under an inert atmosphere while maintaining the temperature at 600C, After stirring 30 min. at 78 C. the solution was treated with gaseous formaldehyde in a stream of nitrogen until five molar equivalents had been added. The reaction was quenched.at 780C by the addition of 5.7 ml, of acetic acid dropwise over a period of 25 min, The reaction soluton was allowed to warm to room temperature and was concentrated in vacuo.To the residue was added 200 ml. of water and 200 ml. of ethyl acetate. The organic layer was separated and the water layer extracted again with ethyl acetate. The organic phases.were combined, washed successively with water 200 ml , 5 aqueous sodium bicarbonate 200 ml, and brine 200 ml, and dried over magnesium sulfate. Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure provides 38.2 g. of the desired product, epimeric at C 6. B, benzyl 6 bromo 6 hydroxymethylpencillanate sulfone To a solution of 500 mg. of benzyl 6 bromo 6 hydroxy meEhylpencillanate in 30 ml, of methylene chloride, cooled in an ice bat the 0 5 C , was added portionwise 633 mg of 85 m chloroperbanzoic acid over a period of 20 mien. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and allowed to stir for about 40 min. The solvent was removed in vacuo and the residue treated with water and ethyl acetate.The pR of the mixture was adjusted to 7.4 with a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and the organic phase separated and treated with 30 ml. of fresh water. The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 8.2 with saturated sodium bicarbonate and the ethyl acetate layer separated and washed with a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and a brine solution,The ethyl acetate layer was separated, dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated to an oil, 500 mg. C. 6 alpha hydroxymethylpenicillanic acid sulfone A suspension of 500 mg. of 5 palladium on charcoal and 500 mg. of benzyl 6 bromo 6 hydroxymethylpenicillanate sulfone in 200 ml. of 50 water methanol was shaken in a hydrogen. atmosphere at an initial pressure of 48 psi for 20 min. An additional 500 mg of fresh catalyst was added and the hydrogen pressure adjusted to 51 psi. After one hour of shaking the catalyst was filtered and the methanol removed in vacuo. The pH of the residual solution was adjusted to 8.0 and extracted with ethyl acetate. The aqueous layer was acidified to pH2 with 6Nhydrochloric acid and the product extracted with ethyl acetate. Removal of the solvent gave 100 mg. of the desired product, which was crystallized from chloroform ethyl acetate containing a drop of dimethyl sulfoxide, m.p 211 212 C dec. .
