## Abstract
An object holding device is described wherein a cup component 8 comprising an elastically deformable sucker cup 18 and an associated air vent passage 9 is urged by spring means 15 into a position in which the end of such passage remote from the sucker cup is closed off by a sealing element 17 on a supporting body 10 in which the cup component is mounted. For releasing an object held by the cup the body 10 and cup component 8 have merely to be relatively displaced against the spring bias to unseal the vent passage 9 .
