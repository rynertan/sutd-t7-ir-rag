# Request queueing in memory controller.

## Abstract
A memory controller 200 controls the operation of a number of memory module units A to D, 210 and includes a number of queues 207 80 which couple to the module units. Each queue includes an address queue register, a control queue register and a data queue register. Each address queue register has tristate control for independent operation. Control circuits 215 which couple to the queue address, control and data registers assign memory cycles between queues on an alternate basis when the queue control registers store requests which are being processed. This enables the interleaving of memory requests which elimin ates processing delays particularly in cases where such requests involve multiword transfers over successive mem ory cycles of operation.
