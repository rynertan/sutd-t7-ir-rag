Such coatings unexpectedly have improved adherence to molded articles over those obtained from similar compositions which contain no free isocyanate. The compositions may contain minor amounts of emulsifiers, fillers, catalysts, cross linking agents, dryers and pigments. In particular, the coatings obtained when the compositions contain electroconductive fillers can be painted by standard electrostatic paint techniques.

In mold coating compositions and methods of application are well known and in particular are described in British Patent 1,457,935. Such processes require injecting a resin compound mixed with reinforcing fibers, usually glass fibers, in the form of either a sheet molding compound or a bulk molding compound into a shaped mold, compressing the mold to form the desired part, applying heat to cure the resin1 opening the mold slightly, injecting a coating composition to fill the space between the substrate and the open mold face, closing the mold slightly to squeeze the coating uniformly over the surface to a thickness of less than 20 mils, usually from 0.05 5 mils, and curing the coating. In the present state of the art, the coating compositions are derived from twocomponent systems which when mixed begin to polymerize.and normally gel within a few hours or days, at which point they become useless as an in mold coating composition.Furthermore, such two components require exact metering and measuring at the point of their use in order to derive a satisfactory coating having uniform properties and curing times. The coating compound mentioned in the abovecited British patent is formed by reacting an isocyanateterminated material, and in some instances an isocyanate, with a material which contains reactive hydrogens in admixture with ethylenically unsaturated resins and ethylenically unsaturated monomers. U.S.Patent 4,210,713 is directed to coating compositions which comprise a urethane modified polymer having at least one acrylate or methacrylate moiety, an alpha, beta ethylenically unsaturated compound copolymerizable with said acrylate or methacrylate moiety and a photosensitizer.

Of particular interest as vinyl terminated polyisocyanurate resins which may be empoyed, instead of the foregoing vinyl terminated polyester urethane resins, as the base resin component a of the compositions of the invention are those derived from an aromatic polyisocyanate and at least one vinylidene carbonyl oxy alkanol characterized by one of the following formulae EMI10.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen or an alkyl group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms R2 is hydrogen, an alkyl group containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, or a chlorinated, brominated, or fluorinated alkyl group containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms R3 is hydrogen, an alkyl group containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms. or a chlorinated, brominated, or fluorinated alkyl group containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms R4 is hydrogen or a methyl or ethyl group, and n is an integer from one to four, with the proviso that R2 and R3 on adjacent carbon atoms are not both alkyl groups or chlorinated, brominated or fluorinated alkyl groups, that is to say at least one of R2 andR3 must be hydrogen. In order to obtain compositions having the excellent combination of high temperature physical properties provided by the present invention, it is preferred that the vinyl terminated polyisocyanurate resin be one wherein at least a major amount of the iso cyanurate moieties are based on one or more vinylidene carbonyl oxy alkanols as defined above.Illustrative examples of such alkanols include hydroxypropyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl acrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate, pentaerythritol trimethacrylate, and diacrylates and dimethacrylates of trimethylol propane, trimethylol ethane, trimethylol methane, and glycerol. A preferred group of vinylidene carbonyl oxy alkanols includes blends of polyfunctional acrylates or methacrylates such as pentaerythritol triacrylate or pentaerythritol trimethacrylate, and mixtures thereof, with one or more monofunctional acrylates or methacrylates such as hydroxypropyl acrylate or hydroxyethyl methacrylate. While the vinyl terminated polyisocyanurates contain moieties derived from one of the vinylidene carbonyl oxy alkanols defined above, the moieties which they contain derived from an aromatic polyisocyanate may be based on any trimerizable aromatic polyisocyanate which is conventionally used in the art for the preparation of isocyanurates. For example,the aromatic polyisocyanate may or may not contain ethylenic unsaturation and it may be monomeric or polymeric. The only essential requirements are that the aromatic polyisocyanate contain at least two aromatic isocyanate groups, be trimerizable, and be free of any groups which interfere with the trimerization of isocyanate groups or with the reaction of an isocyanate group with a hydroxyl group.Illustrative examples of aromatic polyisocyanates which are particularly useful in the preparation of isocyanurate compositions of this invention include 2,4 tolylene diisocyanate 2,6 tolylene diisocyanate m phenylene diisocyanate p phenylene diisocyanate I ,.5 naphthalene diisocyanate 4,4 diphenyl ether diisocyanate 4,41 , 411 tripheny Imethane triisocyanate 2,4,4 triisocyanatodiphenylmethane 2,2 , 4 triisocyanato diphenyl 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate 4,4 benzophenone diisocyanate 2,2 bis 4 isocyanatophenyl propane, 1,4 naphthalene diisocyanate 4 methoxy 1,3 phenylene diisocyanate 4 chloro 1,3 phenylenediisocyanate 4 bromo 1,3 phenylene diisocyanate 4 ethoxy 1,3 phenylene diisocyanate 2,4 diisocyanato diphenyl ether 4,4 diisocyanatodiphenyl 9, lO anthracene diisocyanate 4, 6 dimethyl 1,3 phenylene diisocyanate 4,4 diisocyanatodibenzyl 3,3 dimethyl 4,4 diisocyanatodiphenylmethane 3,3 dimethyl 4,4 diisocyanatodiphenyl 3,3 dimethoxy 4, 4 diisocyanatodiphenyl 1, 8 naphthalene diisocyanate 2,4,6 tolylene triisocyanate 2,4,4 triiso cyanatodiphenyl ether, diphenylmethane diisocyanate polymethylene polyphenylene polyisocyanates available under the trademarks Rubinate M and Papi , having a functionality of from 2.1 to 2.7, 1,3 xylene 4,6 diisocyanate aromatic isocyanate terminated polyurethanes and aromatic isocyanate terminated pre polymers of polyesters.Although it is preferred to use all aromatic polyisocyanate, small amounts of an aliphatic polyisocyanate, for example, 1,6 hexamethylene diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, or alpha,alpha alpha,alpha diisocyanato p xylene, may be used in combination with the aromatic polyisocyanate. The vinyl terminated polyisocyanurate base resins are prepared by reacting an aromatic polyisocyanate with one or more of the above described vinylidene hydroxy compounds to form an isocyanate containing urethane, followed by trimerization of the isocyanate groups to form the ethylenically unsaturated polyisocyanurate resin. The NCO OH mol ratio in the reaction mix is maintained at a range at from 0.75 to 1.6 and preferably from about 0.9 to about 1.4. When the reaction is carried out in equal parts of an inert solvent and the reactants are hydroxypropyl methacrylate and toluene diisocyanate, the preferred molar ratio for sheet molding applications ranges from 0.95 to about 1.05. In carrying out the trimerization reaction, the temperature must be maintained such that the vinylidene group does not undergo the addition polymerization prematurely. Usually the reaction is carried out in a range of OO to about 950C. Up to about 49 mol percent of the vinylidene carbonyl oxy alkanol described in the list above may be replaced with a monohydric alcohol selected from methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, isobutanol, octyl alcohol, cyclohexanol, benzyl alcohol, allyl alcohol, glycerol diallyL ether, trimethylolpropane diallyl ether, saturated halogenated alcohols, halogenated alcohols containing ethylenic unsaturation, for example, dibromoneopentyl glycol monoacrylate and monomethacry late, halogenated allyl alcohols, monohydric alcohols such as 2 bromo ethanol, 3 bromo l propanol, 4 chloro 1 butanol, 2 chloroethanol, 4 chloro l hexanol, 3 chloro 1 propanol, 2,3 dibromo l propanol, 2,3 di chloro l propanol, 2,2, 2 tri chloroethanol, l bromo 2 propanol, l chloro 2 propanol, 1,3 dibromo 2 propanol, and 1,3 dichloro 2 propanol, mono acrylate and mono methacrylate esters of alkoxylated bisphenol A and alkoxylated tetrabromobisphenol A, and polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene ethers of monohydric phenols. Illustrative examples of dihydric alcohols which may be used to replace up to 33 mol percent, and preferably up to 10 mol percent, of the vinylidene carbonyl oxy alkanols described include ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, compounds characterized by the formula EMI14.1 wherein R1 is an alkyl group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, 1,4 butane diol, pentamethylene glycol, hexamethylene glycol, glycerol methyl ether1 polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene ethers of dihydric phenols such as bisphenol A, glycerol monochlorohydrin, glyceryl monostearate, dihydroxy acetone, and monoesters of the above polyols and acrylic acid or methacrylic acid. When the isocyanurates arepreperedSin the absence of solvent, the product formed is a solid and requires special processing which permits the easy removal of the heat generated by the reaction and which prevents the reaction mixture from reaching high temperatures which may induce insolubility and gelation of the products. Among the special processing techniques which may be used is the trimerization of the monourethane in thin layers on moving temperature controlled belts or in temperaturecontrolled trays. Suitable catalysts for carrying out the urethane formation step of the above process in addition to copper salt, are organo metallic compounds of tin, zinc, lead, mercury, cadmium, bismuth, cobalt, manganese, antimony, iron and the like such as, for example, metal salts of carboxylic acids having from about 2 to about 20 carbon atoms including for example stannous octoate, dibutyl tin dilaurate, dibutyl tin diacetate, ferric acetyl acetonate, lead octoate, lead oleate, cobalt naphthanate, lead naphthanate and mixtures thereof. It is preferred that the catalysts be employed in liquid form. Those catalysts which are not ordinarily liquids may be added as a solution in solvent. It is best to carry out the urethane reaction in the absence of a trimerization catalyst in order to reduce premature thickening. The subsequent trimerization of the isocyanate groups is usually carried out in the presence of such catalysts as tertiary amines, organic quaternary ammonium hydroxide compounds, diones, metallic salts of carboxylic acids, alkoxides or phenoxides of alkali or alkaline earth metals, organic phosphines and organo metallic compounds of tin or antimony. The catalyst concentration in the reaction may range from 0.01 3.0 based on the total weight of the resin. A typical vinyl terminated polyisocyanurate resin can be prepared by the following technique.Example J Into a chemical reactor equipped with agitator, condenser, gas pipe connections, vents, and portholes which is first flushed with nitrogen and thereafter sparged with 2 cfm. air and 6 ofra. nitrogen, there is charged 2,680 parts of hydroxypropyl methacrylate and this is agitated at 30 revolutions per minute. Thereafter, 2.5 parts of copper acetate catalyst, 12 parts of a 20 solution of t butyl catechol and 5,743 parts of styrene are charged to the reactor. The contents of the reactor are heated to 420 2 0C and thereafter sparged with 3 4 cfm. nitrogen. Under increased agitation at 50 60 revolutions per minute, 3,064 parts of toluene diisocyanate is added at a rate of 60 70 parts per minute in four 766 part portions.After the first 766 part protion is added, the temperature of the mixture is permitted to rise to 65 C.After the second portion, the temperature is permitted to rise to 78 C. After the third portion, the temperature is permitted to rise to 90 0C and after the fourth portion, the temperature is permitted to stay for one additional hour at 900C, at which time the unreacted isocyanate content should be less than 4.5 . The reaction mix is cooled to 550C and is then mixed with 18 parts N benzyl trimethyl ammonium hydroxide as a 40 g0 methanol solution. The exothermic trimerization reaction thereupon takes place and cooling is required to ensure that the reaction mixture temperature does not go above 600C. The reaction is permitted to continue until the unreacted isocyanate content ranges between 0.05 0.15 and the viscosity ranges between 425 475 cps. At this point, 6 parts of methanesulphonic acid is added to inhibit the activity of the trimerization catalyst. The styrene solution of vinyl terminated polyisocyanurate resin which is thus obtained is stored for later use under conditions which inhibit further polymerization. The reaction product has a number average molecular weight of about 1160, a weight average molecular weight of about 2000, and a polydispersity of about 1.9About 95M0 of the isocyanurates present have a molecular weight of below about 5200 and some below about 26,000.This product corresponds to a resin where the number of isocyanurate rings in most of the isocyanurate molecules is less than 10. The product has a ball and ring melting point of about 95 C and a viscosity in 50 styrene solution of about 400 600 cps at 25 C, and a refractive index of about 1.557 ND20, The infra red spectrum of this product shows absorption bands characteristic of isocyanurates and the essential absence of isocyanate functionality. The hydroxyl number of the product is essentially zero.Example K This example illustrates the preparation of an allophanate free resin containing a large amount of isocyanate. A small reaction vessel is charged with 100 g.of a resin prepared according to Example J, which by NMR analysis had an allophanate to urethane ratio of 0.45.0.4 ml of Triton B 4 0 solution of benzyltrimethyl ammonium hydroxide in methanol is added and 0.5 ml of a 10 solution of equal amounts of t butylcatechol and the monomethyl ether of hydroquinone. The resulting mixture is heated for 1 1 2 hours at 95 C. The final product is free of all detectable allophanate linkages upon NMR analysis. Tractable shaped articles capable of being further shaped having from 5 95 by weight ethylenically unsaturated polyisocyanurate resin having 1 3 vinylidene groups per isocyanurate ring or its equivalent in a solution with at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer which will react with ethylenically unsaturated groups in the isocyanurate resin can be made by thickening a homogenous mixture of polyisocyanurate resin ethylenic ally unsaturated monomer solution with polyurethane made in solution therewith by reacting an aromatic polyisocyanate having 2 5 isocyanate groups per mol with a polyol having a molecular weight of about 300 2,000 and wherein the mol ratio of the total hydroxyl groups to isocyanate groups in the reaction mix is held between 0.66 and 0.95. Ethylenically unsaturated polyester resins which are, as a further alternative, suitable for use as the base resin component a of the compositions of the invention may be obtained, for example, by esterification of an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, or a mixture of such acids, with a saturated diol or a mixture of such diols, or by esterification of a saturated dicarboxylic acid with one or more unsaturated diols. If desired one or more unsaturated acid or acids may be used together with or in place of the saturated acid or acids, and one or more unsaturated diol or diols may be used together with or in place of the saturated diol or diols. Where possible, an anhydride may be used in place of the corresponding dicarboxylic acid. One or more carboxylic acids of functionality greater than two may be used together with or in place of one or more of the dicarboxylic acids.Similarly, one or more polyols of functionality greater than two may be used together with or in place of one or more of the diols.

Examples of ethylenically unsaturated monomers free from groups reactive with an isocyanate, which are suitable for use as component b of the compositions of the invention, include, for example, vinyl esters, aromatic vinyl compounds and vinyl nitriles. Suitable vinyl esters include, for example, vinyl acetate and esters of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid having the formula CH2 CR COOR , where R is hydrogen or methyl and R is an alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, aralkyl or cycloalkyl group. For example, R may be an alkyl group having from 1 to 20, and preferably from 1 to 10, carbon atoms.Particular vinyl esters which may be mentioned include, for example, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, nand iso propyl methacrylate, and n , iso and tertiarybutyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate and glycidyl acrylate. Aromatic vinyl compounds which may be mentioned include, for example, styrene and derivatives thereof, e.g. a alkyl derivatives of styrene, e.g. a methyl styrene, and vinyl toluene. Suitable vinyl nitriles include, for example, acrylonitrile and derivatives thereof, e.g. methacrylonitrile. Polyfunctional vinyl monomers, that is to say monomers containing two or more vinyl groups, are also suitable. Suitable such monomers include, for example, glycol dimethacrylate, hexanediol diacrylate, neopentyl diol diacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, divinyl benzene and diallyl phthalate. As component c of the compositions of the invention there is employed a polyisocyanate, which may be aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic or may contain, in the same polyisocyanate molecule, aliphatic and aromatic isocyanate groups, aliphatic and cyclo aliphatic and aromatic isocyanate groups, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic isocyanate groups or cyclo aliphatic and aromatic isocyanate groups. If desired, mixtures of two or more different polyisocyanates may be employed.Suitable polyisocyanates include methylene bis 4 cyclo hexyl isocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, 1,3 phenylene diisocyanate, 1,4 phenylene diisocyanate, 4 methoxy 1, 3 phenylene diisocyanate, 4 ethoxy 1,3 phenylene diisocyanate, 4, 6 dimethyl 1, 3 phenylene diisocyanate, 4 chloro 1,3 phenylene diisocyanate, 4 bromo l, 3 phenylene diisocyanate, 2,4 tolylene diisocyanate, 2,6 tolylene diisocyanate, 1,3 xylene 4,6 diisocyanate, 2,4 diphenyl ether diisocyanate, 4,4 diphenylether diisocyanate, 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate, dichlorodiphenylmethane diisocyanate, 4,4 diisocyanatodiphenyl, 3,3 dimethyl 4, 4. diisocyanatodiphenyl, 3,3 dimethoxy4,4 diisocyanatodiphenyl, 4,4 benzophenone diisocyanate, 2,2 bis 4 isocyanatophenyl propane, 4,4 diisocyantodibenzyl, 1,4 naphthalene diisocyanate, 1,5 naphthalene diisocyanate, 1,8 naphthalene diisocyanate, 9,lo anthra cene diisocyanate, 2,4,6 tolylene triisocyanate, 2,4,4 triisocyanatodiphenylmethane, 2,4,4 triisocyanatodiphenyl ether, 4,4 ,4 triphenylmethane triisocyanate, 2,2,4 triisocyanatodiphenyl, and polymethylenepolyphenyl polyisocyanates. In addition to such polyisocyanates, there may also be considered for use blocked or masked isocyanates which are substituted urethane producte which undergo decomposition at temperature ranging from about 150 .200 C and above to form a polyisocyanate and unreacted.by product. Such blocked polyisocyanates may be used in the presence of a catalyst which causes them to decompose to form free polyisocyanates at a temperature lower than about 1250. In addition to the polyisocyanates and blocked polyisocyanates, there may be employed NCO terminated prepolymers which may or may not have ethylenic unsaturation and which may be able to undergo polymerization with the ethylenically unsaturated monomer. Such combinations are derived from polyhydroxy terminated polyols, polyethers and polyesters which may contain ethylenic unsatura tion. In bringing about the curing of the compositions of the invention, reaction between the ethylenically unsaturated base resin and the monomer is usually activated by the presence of a catalyst, for example, a peroxide such as benzoyl peroxide, cyclohexanone peroxide, ditertiary butyl peroxide, dicumyl peroxide, tert butyl peroctoate, tert butyl perbenzoate, l,l bis tert butylperoxy cyclohexane, 1, 1 bis tert butylperoxy 3 ,3,5 trimethyl cyclohexane and 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 bis 2 ethylhexanoyl peroxy hexane. Some of these catalysts react at low temperatures to initiate free radicals, while others are activated at high temperatures in the presence of an accelerator, such as a dilute solution of cobalt soap or an amine. The selection of the free radical catalyst is important if one is to control the time at which the addition polymerization takes place. It is contemplated that lightactivated free radical catalysts may also be used if lower temperatures are preferred. In the performance of the present invention, it is preferred that the addition polymerization between the base resin and the ethylenically unsaturated monomer takes place within the mold at the temperature of the mold. The coating compositions of the invention are homogeneous mixtures of the above described components and minor amounts of other ingredients. Preferred coatings contain 20 804 by weight of the ethylenically unsaturated base resins selected from vinyl terminated polyester urethane resins, vinyl terminated polyisocyanurate resins and ethylenically unsaturated polyesters as hereinbefore defined 30 60 S by weight of ethylenically unsaturated monomers free from groups reactive with isocyanate groups and 2 15 by weight of polyisocyanate. In addition to these components, the blends may contain antioxidants, mold release agents, adhesion promotors, pigments, fillers, dispersing agents and catalysts. A translucent coating is made by blending the base resin, the ethylenically unsaturated monomer and polyisocyanate along with antioxidants, mold release agents and free radical type initiator catalysts. However, most desirable coating compositions contain coloring agents, pigments and fillers which form an opaque or a single colored surface. Of particular interest are those compositions which contain conductive pigments such as electroconductive carbon black pigments which provide a surface which can be painted by electrostatic techniques. The coating compositions containing free isocyanate must be stored under preferably air tight and light free conditions in order to prevent premature decomposition resulting from either reaction of isocyanate with moisture or premature addition polymerization of the unsaturated materials. By use of the compositions of the invention, there may be obtained compression or injection molded, fully cur ed, reinforced thermoset articles having a compression or injection molded coating which exhibits superior smoothness, adherence and durability to coatings derived from similar compositions which contain no free isocyanate. The articles in question may be derived from molding resins such as polyesters, polyurea urethanes, polyureas, polyurethanes, polyisocyanurates, polyepoxies and polycarbonates. The coating compositions can be cured in contact with fully cured sheet molding compositions, but are not limited to those shown in the following general example PROCEDURE FOR COATING POLYESTER SHEET MOLDING COMPOUNDS. Into a 12 x 12 flat mold is placed a gel pancake made essentially according to the following procedure 4,000 parts of a 65 solution of unsaturated polyester in styrene, the polyester being essentially polypropylene fumarate sold by Rohm and Haas under the mark PARAPLEX P340 3,240 parts of a 35 solution of polymethylmethacrylate in styrene sold by Rohm and Haas under the mark PARAPLEX P681 772 parts of 35 solution of polymethylmethacry late in styrene PARAPT X P543 10,522 parts of calcium carbonate filler camel Wite 70 parts of tertiary butyl perbenzoate catalyst 350 parts of zinc stearate 316 parts of magnesium hydroxide thickener and 7,830 parts of glass fibers.This is molded into a sheet having a thickness of 1 4 inch, at a temperature of 135 150 under a pressure of 400 psi. After two minutes the mold is opened and 5 10 grams of peroxidecatalyzed coating composition as described in Tables I through V are added from a syringe or automatically. The mold is closed under 400 pounds of pressure and after two minutes the coating is cured over the SMC part and thereafter the molded part is taken from the mold. After a 24 hour conditioning at room temperature, the coatings are tested for adhesion to the substrate according to a procedure outlined in the American Society for Testing Materials Test ASTM D 3359 74, otherwise referred to as the cross cut tape test. Test results appear in Tables I V. Another adhesion test referred to in the industry as the GM X test, developed by theGeneral Motors Corporation is conducted by cutting with a razor blade a straight line from the upper left corner of a panel to the lower right corner and another from the upper right to the lower left corner through the coating to the substrate. Over this cross cut is placed Scotch brand reinforced acetate number 710 adhesive tape which is applied under thumb pressure and thereafter removed by pulling swiftly. The removal of coating on the tape is measured visually and rated 0 10.A rating of 10 is awarded when no coating is removed, while a rating of O is awarded when all coating is removed. This rating appears for examples listed in Tables I through V.Results of these tests indicate in the following tables that controls employing no polyisocyanate in the coating formulation have very poor adhesion when compared with those that employ polyisocyanateor blocked polyisocyanate.Example 1 A coating formulation is formed by mixing with agitation 66 parts of a 50t 0 styrene solution containing a vinyl maleate urethane as made in Example A 0.38 parts of a 10 tertiary butyl catechol styrene solution 0.75 part of Zelec UN mold release agent 0.2 part AntiTerra U80 pigment wetting agent 6.67 parts of styrene 1 part Cabosil M5 colloidal silica 0.8 part of Sterling R non conductive carbon black pigment 8.0 parts of titanium dioxide pigment 11.2 parts of Nytal 300 magnesium silicate filler.

The coatings are applied according to the procedure ofExample 1.Results of adhesion tests are shown in TableIII. Control H containing no added polyisocyanate has poor adhesionExamples 18, 19 and 20 The coating formula of Examples 15 17 is repeated, with the exception that 70 parts of the vinyl maleate urethane resin of Example B and 7.23 parts of styrene are employed, to give a coating having a viscosity of 6,470 centipoises.

The coatings are applied as described in Example 1 with varying quantities of Rubinate M polyisocyanate as shown in Table IV. Results of adhesion tests are shown in Table IV.Examples 24, 25 and 26 A coating composition is prepared according toExamples 21, 22 and 23, with the exception that 60 parts of the base resin of Example B and an additional 10 parts of Kelpoxy G 272 100 epoxy copolymer are added to produce a formula having a viscosity of 14,720 centipoise.This material is applied as described in Example 1, with varying amounts of Rubinate M polyisocyanate employed in the formula, and tested for adhesion as shown inTable V.Examples 27, 28 and 29 Three formulations are made by intermixing 60 parts, 60 parts and 77.23 parts respectively of the 50 vinylmaleate urethane base resin prepared according toExample 3 15, 15 and 10 parts respectively of Kelpoxy G 272 100 epoxy copolymer 0.38 part of a 10 hydroquin one solution in acetone 4 parts of a 10 lecithin solution in styrene 0.2 part of Aerosil 1 R 972 colloidal silica 1 part of Sylvosiv 120 zeolite molecular sieve 2 parts of CX 72R electroconductive carbon black pigment 12.19 parts of Nytal1, 300 magnesium silicate filler 3, 3 and 5 parts respectively of trimethylolpropane triacrylate and 17.23, 5.23 and 5.23 parts respectively of styrene.

The formulations are coated as described inExample 1, with the results of the adhesion tests being shown in Table V. From the results of the adhesion tests it will be seen that only small amounts of a polyisocyanate improve the adhesion of the coating compositions to the substrate. These results are surprising since no know reaction can take place between the polymerizing ingredients and the isocyanate in the improved formulation.
