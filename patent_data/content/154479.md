# Acrylic polymer composition for bonding metal powders.

## Abstract
An acrylic polymer used has a wt average molecular wt of 5 150 10⁴ and is formed from alkyl meth acrylate of average 3 12C in the alkyl moiety, optionally copolymerized with 0.5 to 20 wt of a monomer having a functional group e.g. a mono or diolefin carboxylic acid the polymer may be mixed with 0.2 to 50 wt of an adhesion imparting resin e.g. a phenolic resin this component must have a glass transition temperature of 70 to 10 C and an elastic modulus of 0.05 to 50 kg cm² at 25 C. The polymer may be formed by reaction in solvent for the composition. 100 parts by wt of a metal powder, e.g. an iron alloy, e.g. multi component eutectic alloy, are mixed with up to 7 parts of the polymer component, dissolved in an organic solvent, and the composition is formed into a sheet 0.5 to 5 mm thick or shaped article which is flexible without the inclusion of any plasticiser and can be sintered. A sheet thereof can be used as a protective covering on a metal substrate.
