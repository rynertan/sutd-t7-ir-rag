# A boiler for heating the heat transfer medium in a heating system.

## Abstract
A method and a boiler for heating a heat transfer medium such as water in a heating system. The combustion gases are brought into heat transfer contact with the heat transfer medium over a large specific, heat transfer surface. The heat transfer medium flows in the opposite direction to the com bustion gases and the gases are caused to flow downwardly and are thereby cooled to a temperature which is lower than the temperature at the outlet for the medium heated by the gases before the gases are discharged to atmosphere. The boiler is fired by oil and or gas and the combustion chamber 16 is arranged immediately above one end of the smoke pipes 22 . The other end of the smoke pipes 22 dis charge into a collecting chamber 24 provided with an outlet 28 for the combustion gases. The collecting chamber 24 is provided with an outlet 34 for condensation from the com bustion gases.
