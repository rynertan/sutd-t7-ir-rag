# Shunt current protection for circulating electrolyte in monopolar battery systems.

## Abstract
The performance of a monopolar aqueous battery system 10 may be enhanced by circulating the electrolyte. However, the circulating electrolyte produces undesirable shunt cur rents when the system is electrically connected in a series ar ray. Such a battery system 10 includes cells 11a 11d elec trically connected in series and hydraulically connected in par allel, and means defining a hydraulic pathway 12a, 12b for an electrolyte common to at least two of the cells. An electrical electrolytic conductive bypass path is formed through the shared electrolyte around the cells 11a 11d . To reduce or eli minate the shunt currents in the shared electrolyte means 21a, 21b, 22a, 22b are included for applying a protective cur rent which results in a REDOX reaction couple, wherein water is electrically consumed at the protective current anode 21a, 22a and electrically replaced at the protective current cathode 22a, 22b . The protective current is applied through at least a part of the conductive bypass path through the shared electro lyte in the same direction as the shunt current, of a magnitude to at least reduce the shunt current.
