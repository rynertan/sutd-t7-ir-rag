# Method of and apparatus for producing video signal associated with photographic image.

## Abstract
Video signals representative of photographic images which are stored in a plurality of substantially equally dimensioned frames 12a in horizontal and vertical positions are produced by picking up the images. A first signal indicative of a horizontal vertical position and a top bottom orientation of the photographic image stored in any of the frames 12a is entered. The photographic image is rotated relatively in response to the first signal. For a vertically positioned image, a video signal is produced which is representative of the image a magnification of which is smaller than that of a horizontally positioned image. Such a procedure provides a video signal which represents an image in a non inverted top bottom orientation without essential part of the image omitted.
