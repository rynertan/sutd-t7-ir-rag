# Single lens having one aspherical surface.

## Abstract
A single lens is described for the formation of a scan ning spot on an information surface of a transparent record carrier substrate. The lens has one aspherical surface and one spherical or plane surface. The curvatures of the lens surfaces and the thickness of the lens are such that a com pensation is obtained for aberrations caused by the sub strate.
