## Description
The invention relates to a xylose isomerase, a method for production of such xylose isomerase, an immobilized xylose isomerase and a method for isomerization of glucose to fructose. Enzymes capable of isomerizing glucose to fructose i.e. glucose isomerases, may be obtained from a large number of different microorganisms, and the enzyme yield and the properties of the enzymes vary from species to species even frequently from strain to strain. In all xylose isomerase producing strains found in nature xylose is required in the medium for maximum enzyme production. All described glucose isomerases fundamentally are xylose isomerases. Also, in regard to enzyme nomenclature they are classified as EC 5.3.1.5, and glucose isomerase is not to be found in the official enzyme nomenclature. Thus, for the sake of clarity the enzyme in the following ordinarily will be identified as xylose isomerase, even if the most important application thereof is the isomerization of glucose to fructose. The economy related to the production of xylose isomerases depends largely on the cost of the substrate and the enzyme yield, and the most important enzyme properties, which are particularly important for the economic use in the isomerization process, are good purification yield and good ability to be converted to an immobilized product with satisfactory physical and enzyme chemical properties, e.g. stability at high temperatures, resistance towards physical pressure and a good half life. No one of the known xylose isomerases including the commercial glucose isomerase products do possess the best possible values of all desirable properties. Often it is necessary to compromise. On this basis a great amount of research has been carried out in the field comprising production of xylose isomerases capable of isomerization of glucose to fructose from different microbiological sources. This research is reflected in the patent litterature, which comprise huge numbers of patents covering different microbial sources of xylose isomerase. Thus, both bacteria, e.g. belonging to the genera Streptomyces, Actinoplanes, Bacillus, and Flavobacterium, and fungi e.g. belonging to the class Basidiomycetes, have been described in the patent litterature as xylose isomerase producing microorganisms. Also, just to choose some examples, among many others the following species belonging to the genus Streptomyces have been described in the patent litterature as xylose isomerase producing microorganisms. Syrups containing a mixture of glucose and fructose are widely used in industry because of their sweet taste and their low tendency to crystallize. Such syrups are preferably produced from glucose syrups using a xylose isomerase with glucose isomerase activity to catalyze the isomerization of glucose to fructose. It is important for the economy of this process that the enzyme costs are low and that there be a negligible formation of by products, which will have to be removed before the syrup can be used. Thus the purpose of the invention is to provide a xylose isomerase, which can be produced with a good compromise in regard to fermentation yield, purification yield and ability of the produced xylose isomerase to be converted to an immobilized product with satisfactory physical and enzyme chemical properties, a corresponding immobilized xylose isomerase, and a corresponding method for isomerization of glucose to fructose. Now, surprisingly according to the invention it has been found that bacteria belonging to the Streptomyces murinus cluster are xylose isomerase producing with high fermentation yield and furthermore that the xylose isomerase can be produced with a good purification yield and an ability to be converted to an immobilized product with satisfactory physical and enzyme chemical properties for application in an industrial glucose isomerization process, and that constitutive and glucose repression resistant strains of the Streptomyces murinus cluster provide special advantages in regard to fermentation economy. In this application with claims the designation Streptomyces murinus cluster is to be understood as defined in Rolf Dieter HEITZER s dissertation Numerische Taxonomie der Actinomyceten Gattungen STREPTOMYCES und STREPTOVERTICILLIUM filed January 27, 1981 , obtainable from Biological department o the Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany. This means that S. murinus DSM 40091, DSM 40240 previously named S. roseoluteus , NRRL 8171, FERM P 3710, DSM 3252, and DSM 3253 all belong to this streptomyces murinus cluster. It has been found that the xylose isomerase produced by these above indicated six members of the cluster are immunologically identical as determined by tandem crossed immunoelectrophoresis with antibodies produced against the xylose isomerase produced by means of DSM 3252, this fact emphasizing the close taxonomic relationship between these individual members of the cluster. Thus, the xylose isomerase according to the invention is characterized by the fact that it is immunologically identical to the xylose isomerase produced by cultivation of a strain of the Streptomyces murinus cluster. In a preferred embodiment of the xylose isomerase according to the invention the xylose isomerase is produced by cultivation of a strain of the Streptomyces murinus cluster. Despite the fact that a huge number of species are known as xylose isomerase producers, no strain of the Streptomyces murinus cluster is known as a xylose isomerase producer, and surprisingly it has been found that any strain of the Streptomyces murinus cluster is very well suited for production of xylose isomerase and provides the advantages indicated above. Also the invention comprises a method for production of a xylose isomerase, wherein an aerobic submerged fermentation is carried out with a strain of the Streptomyces murinus cluster on a conventional medium containing carbon and nitrogen, whereafter the thus formed xylose isomerase is recovered. In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention the strain of the streptomyces murinus cluster is DSM 40091, DSM 40240, NRRL 8171, FERM P 3710, or DSM 3252. DSM is Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen, Göttingen, Germany. NRRL is Northern Regional Research Laboratory, USA. FERM is Fermentation Research Institute, Japan. If xylose is present in the medium, the fermentation yield is satisfactory, and also, a satisfactory immobilized xylose isomerase can be produced. In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention the strain of the Streptomyces murinus cluster is constitutive in regard to xylose isomerase production. In this case it is not necessary to incorporate the expensive substrate component xylose in the medium, but any cheap carbon source, e.g. glucose will do. Furthermore, surprisingly it has been found that it is possible to find real constitutive and glucose repression resistant mutants of the S. murinus cluster thus S. murinus DSM 3253 being a real constitutive and glucose repression resistant mutant of S. murinus DSM 3252 is unique in producing more xylose isomerase in media with glucose than in media with xylose, vide example 1. Prior art mutant strains of xylose isomerase producing Streptomyces species referred to as constitutive U.S. 4.399.222, example 3, and US Re 29.152, table 3 all produced higher enzyme yields in xylose containing media than in media without the xylose inducer. Reference is made to example 4, which represents a comparison between the xylose isomerase producing ability of a constitutive mutant belonging to the S. murinus cluster, which can be used in the method according to the invention, and of prior art constitutive strains of xylose isomerase producing microorganisms, related to different media. In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention the strain of the Streptomyces murinus cluster is DSM 3253. It has been found that a very high yield can be obtained with this strain on an absolutely xylose free medium, reference being made to examples 1 3. For the sake of a better survey reference is made to the following table I which shows some key properties of the Streptomyces murinus strains referred to in this specification. From table II shown below some important taxonomic characteristics of four Streptomyces murinus cluster strains appear. The significance of the abbreviations used in table II is as follows In contrast to DSM 40091 the S. murinus type strain , DSM 3252 and DSM 3263 did not produce any antibiotics, For further details in regard to the tests in the above table reference is made to the DSM publication Methoden zur Untersuchung von Streptomyceten und einigen anderen Actinomyceten edited by Hans J. Kutzner, Reiner M. Kroppenstedt and Felicitas Korn Wendisch. Also, the invention comprises an immobilized xylose isomerase characterized by the fact that the corresponding xylose isomerase is the xylose isomerase according to the invention. The immobilized product can be produced by means of several immobilization method known per se, and it has been found that the immobilized xylose isomerases perform excellently in glucose isomerization columns. Reference is made to some of the following examples. Also, the invention comprises a method for isomerization of glucose to fructose, characterized by the fact that an aqueous solution of glucose is isomerized by means of a soluble preparation of the xylose isomerase produced according to the invention. In cases, when a process utilizing a soluble xylose isomerase is preferred, the isomerization process proceedes satisfactorily. Finally, the invention comprises a method for isomerization of glucose to fructose, characterized by the fact that an aqueous solution of glucose is isomerized by means of the immobilized xylose isomerase according to the invention. It has been found that a continuous glucose isomerization can be carried out on an industrial scale with superior economy and operational stability. The invention will be illustrated by the following examples. Examples 1 4 illustrate fermentation of the xylose isomerase examples 5 and 6 illustrate production of the immobilized xylose isomerase, and example 7 illustrates the application of the immobilized xylose isomerase. In this example all six above indicated strains of the Streptomyces murinus cluster were cultivated to produce xylose isomerase. Each of the strains was grown for one day at 37 C on agar slants of the following composition expressed as g per liter of distilled water. 5 ml of a suspension of cells from each strain were then transferred to 100 ml of production medium in 500 ml baffle bottom Erlenmeyer flasks. The production media a and b pH 7.2 consisted of the following components in the quantities indicated expressed as grams per liter of tap water . Xylose and glucose were autoclaved separately and added aseptically after cooling to room temperature. The inoculated flasks were incubated at 30 C. After 72 hours of incubation the culture broths were assayed for xylose isomerase activity. The results obtained are shown in the following table III. One GINU is the amount of enzyme which isomerizes 1 µmol of glucose to fructose per minute. Prior to the isomerization the samples are pretreated with lysozyme 2 mg ml at 37 C for 30, minutes and Mg and Co are added in amounts sufficient to generate concentrations of 0.1 M and 0.002 M, respectively. Isomerization takes place at 65 C in a 0.25 M maleate buffer of pH 6.50 which contains 5 glucose, 0.05 M Mg , 0.002 M Co and 0.05 CHCl₃. After 20 minutes the reaction is stopped by addition of 0.1 M perchloric acid. The formed fructose is then determined by the cysteine carbazole reaction Lloyd et al., Cereal Chemistry 49, 544 1972 . In this example DSM 3252 and DSM 3253 were grown on agar slants as in example 1, but at 30 C. After incubation for one day the colonies were harvested and used for inoculation in 1.5 1 fermentors. The fermentation medium in the fermentors comprised Corn steep liquour 40 g l , NH₄ ₂SO₄ 4.5 g l K₂HPO₄ 1.5 g l , antifoam Pluronic 0.33 ml l and either glucose 5 g l or xylose 5 g l added after sterilization. pH was adjusted to 7.0 with NaOH prior to sterilization. The fermentors were run at 30 C with an agitation of 750 rpm and an air flow rate of 0.6 vol vol per minute. After 3 days the following results were obtained vide table IV In this example DSM 3253 was grown on agar slants as in example 1, but at 30 C. After incubation for 2 days the colonies were transferred to a sterilized 300 l fermentor containing corn steep liquour 12 kg , glucose sterilized separately, 1.5 kg and antifoaming agent Pluronic 50 ml . Prior to sterilization, pH was adjusted to 7.0 with sodium hydroxide. This fermentor was operated at 30 C with an agitation of 200 rpm and an air flow rate of 200 l min. After 25 hours, 150 l from this fermentor was inoculated into the 1500 l fermentor containing corn steep liquour 60 kg , ammonium sulphate 6.75 kg , potassium dihydrogen phosphate 2.25 kg and antifoaming agent Pluronic, 250 ml . pH was adjusted to 7.0 before sterilization at 121 C for 60 minutes. Operational temperature, agitation and aeration were 30 C, 190 rpm and 1000 l min., respectively. After 3 hours, 8 kg of glucose was added and from 10 hours onwards, glucose was continuously added at a rate of 0.5 kg hour. 87 hours after inoculation the fermentor contained 11.9 GINU ml or totally 18 MGINU. This example comprises several fermenations, some belonging to the prior art, some belonging to the invention, all in shake flasks. The fermentations are carried out in different media, as indicated in table V. The fermentations were carried out for two days at 30 C. The percentage ratio between the yield on the glucose containing medium and the yield on the xylose containing medium appears in the columns designated Percentage degree of constitutiveness . It has to be noted that the Percentage degree of constitutiveness includes the resistance to glucose repression. All yields are expressed as total GINU ml, the values indicated in the table below being averages of 2 8 independent fermentations. The medium b in column 4 is identical to the medium b in column 1, except for the fact that b contains 1 glucose instead of 0.5 glucose. The media a and a are interrelated in the same manner. The percentage degree of constitutiveness, as exemplified for DSM 3253, column 11, is calculated as the percentage ratio between the yields in GINU ml on the glucose containing medium and the xylose containing medium, i.e. From column 3 in relation to DSM 3253 it appears that DSM 3253 produces more xylose isomerase in medium b with glucose than in medium a with xylose. None of the other strains listed shows this extraordinary feature. Also it appears from the table that the percentage degree of constitutiveness of the prior art constitutive strains is very low in comparison with the percentage degree of constitutiveness of the constitutive strain DSM 3253 used in the method according to the invention. The medium B in column 9 is designed by us in order to obtain a more fair calculation of the percentage degree of constitutiveness. This example describes the immobilization of xylose isomerase produced by DSM 3252. A culture broth produced as described in example 2 with xylose in the medium was centrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded. The bottom phase, containing the cells with xylose isomerase activity, was freeze dried. 6 g of freeze dried cells were dissolved in 150 g deionized water with 3 g spray dried egg albumen. The pH was adjusted from 5.90 to 7.55 and 2.75 ml of 50 glutaraldehyde solution was added in order to crosslink the proteins. The pH was maintained at 7.5 for 35 minutes and thereafter diluted with 250 g deionized water. The mixture was flocculated with 30 ml of Superfloc C8351, a cationic flocculant, and 4.5 ml of Al30, an anionic flocculant. The flocs were collected by Filtration and the filter cake was granulated and dried. The activity of the dried granulate was 78.8 glucose isomerase units g, the activity unit being defined in NOVO document F 850399. This example describes the immobilization of xylose isomerase produced by DSM 3253. A culture broth produced as described in example 2 with glucose in the medium was centrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded. The cell sludge was used directly for the immobilization experiment. 6 g of spray dried egg albumen was added to 100 g cell sludge with 8.9 of dry substance. The pH was adjusted to 7.5 after addition of deionized water to a total volume of 1200 ml. 4.6 ml of 50 glutaraldehyde was added, and the pH was maintained at 7.5 by addition of NaOH solution. 500 ml of deionized water was added after 1 hour and the mixture was flocculated with the same flocculants as described in Example 5. The flocs were recovered by filtration, granulated and dried. The activity of the dried granulate was 184.5 glucose isomerase units g, the activity unit being defined in NOVO document F 850399. This example describes the application of the immobilized glucose isomerase produced from DSM 3253. 11.7 g of the dried granulate produced in Example 6 was soaked in 200 ml 45 w w glucose syrup, pH 7.5 for two hours. The enzyme particles were then transferred to a water jacketed column and a 45 w w glucose syrup with 0.4 g MgSO₄, 7H₂o l and 2 mM NaHCO₃ at pH 7.5 was continuously pumped through the column at room temperature. After 1 hour the column temperature was raised to 60 C and the flow adjusted to obtain a 41 44.5 conversion to fructose. The activity increased during the first 137 hours of isomerization. The syrup flow after 137 hours was 0.88 g syrup dry substance per g enzyme per hour and the degree of conversion in the outlet syrup was 44.3 . The experiment was terminated after 328 hours, the final syrup flow being 1.03 g syrup dry substance per g enzyme per hour with a degree of conversion in the outlet syrup of 42.0 . The deposits DSM 3252 and DSM 3253 were made at the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen on 27th February, 1985 and are governed by the Budapest Treaty. The features disclosed in the foregoing description and in the following claims may, both separately and in any combination thereof, be material for realising the invention in diverse forms thereof.
