# Method of identifying objects.

## Abstract
A plurality of objects are identified by the steps of prepar ing a reference pattern B comprising picture image data of a predetermined number and representing the brightness relat ing to the configuration of the objects extracting a brightness pattern A comprising a predetermined number of picture image data among picture image data in a predetermined field of view in which the objects presents and determining the correlation between the reference pattern B and the brightness pattern A so as to judge as to whether the bright ness pattern A is the brightness pattern related to the config uration of the objects. When determining the correlation, average values of respective patterns are subtracted respe tively from the brightness pattern and the reference pattern to obtain patterns A and B obtained by converting then in connection with deviations from the average values. A pattern A is obtained by normalizing pattern A and the inner pro ducts of patterns A and B and of patterns A and B are determined. These two inner products are used as a reference value for identifying the objects.
