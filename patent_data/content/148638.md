# Cylindrical fibrous structures and method of manufacture.

## Abstract
Cylindrical fibrous structures comprising a fibrous mass of nonwoven, synthetic, polymeric microfibers wherein the mi crofibers are substantially free of fiber to fiber bonding and secured to each other by mechanical entanglement or inter twining, the fiber structure having a substantially constant voids volume over at least a substantial portion of the structure and, preferably, a graded fiber diameter structure, both as measured in the radial direction. The structures are particularly useful as depth filters. The method for preparing such fibrous structures com prises the steps of a extruding synthetic, polymeric material from a fiber izing die and attenuating the extruded polymeric material to form microfibers by the application of one or more gas streams directed toward a rotating mandrel and a forming roll in opera tive relationship with the mandrel b cooling the synthetic, polymeric microfibers prior to their collection on the mandrel to a temperature below that at which they bond or fuse together, thereby substantially elimi nating fiber to fiber bonding and c collecting the cooled microfibers on the mandrel as a nonwoven, synthetic fibrous mass while applying a force on the exterior surface of the collected microfibers by the forming roll wherein the process variables are controlled to form the cylindrical fiber structure with at least the major portion of the fibrous mass having a substantially constant voids volume.
