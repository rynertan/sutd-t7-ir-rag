# Safety belt emergency locking retractor.

## Abstract
The main locking mechanism of an emergency locking retractor for a vehicle safety belt comprises teeth 118 on the flanges 24 of the spool on which the belt is wound, the spool being mounted in bearings arranged to permit limited movement in a direction perpendicular to the axis of rotation, between a position in which said teeth engage with complementary teeth on the frame of the retractor. In order to optimise the number of teeth 118 which are in engage ment with teeth 114 117 on the frame when the spool is in its engaged position, the tips of the teeth 114 on the frame members are located on a circle centred on the axis 110 of the spool when the latter is in its released position and the locking face of each tooth facing away from the plane B B in which the axis of the spool moves between its engaged position and its released position is oriented at the same angle a to the radial line from such tooth to the axis 112 of the spool when in its engaged position as that between the locking face of each tooth 118 on the discs and the corresponding radius thereof.
