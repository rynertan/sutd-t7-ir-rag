The compounds of general formula I are valuable intermediates for the preparation of the N heterocyclicaminocarbonyl arylsulfonamides disclosed in our EP A 7687, to which the reader is referred for further information.The said arylsulfonamides possess potent herbicidal and plant growth regulant activities. The following preferences for certain substituents in the compounds of general formula I are based primarily on the activity of the N heterocyllicaminocarbonyl aryl sulfonamides obtainable from them 1 A compound of general formula I wherein R3 isH and is para to the sulfonyl group. 2 A compound of preferred 1 wherein R is C1 C6 alkyl C2 C4 alkyl substituted with one to four substituents selected from 0 3 atoms of F or C1 and 0 2 methoxy groups C3 C6 alkenyl C3 C4 alkenyl substituted with 1 3 Cl atoms, C5 C6 cycloalkyl C5 C6 cycloalkenyl C5 C6 cycloalkyl substituted with any of one to four methyl groups, methoxy, C2H5 and Cl C4 C7 cycloalkylalkyl CH2CH2OR7 CH2CH2CH2OR7 EMI2.1 orEMI2.2 where R8isCH3, CH2CH3, CH CH3 2 or CH2CH2Cl. 3 A compound of preferred 2 wherein R2 is H, Cl or CH3 and R is C1 C4 alkyl C3 C4 alkenyl C2 C3 alkyl substituted with OCH3 or C1 C3 alkenyl substituted with 1 3 C1 atoms C5 C6 cycloalkyl cyclohexenyl cyclohexyl substituted with 1 3 methyl groups CH2CH2OR7 whereR7 is C2H5, CH CH3 2, phenyl or CH2 CH2 CI orEMI2.3 4 A compound of preferred 3 wherein R2 and R3 are both H. 5 A compound of preferred 2, 3 or 4 wherein R isC1 C4 alkyl, C2 C3 alkyl substituted with Cl C3 C4 alk enyl Ch2CH 2OCH3 EMI2.4 CH2 CH2 OC2 H EMI2.5 or CH2CH2CH2OC2H5. Compounds of particular interest include methyl 2 isocyanatosulfonyl benzoate and isopropyl 2 isocyanatosulfonyl benzoate. The compounds of general formula I can be made by reacting a corresponding sulfonamide of general formulaEMI3.1 wherein R, R2 and R3 are as hereinbefore defined, with phosgene. A preferred method of carrying out this reaction using catalytic amounts of an alkyl isocyanate and 1,4diaza 2,2,2 bicyclooctane is illustrated below EMI3.2 A mixture of the appropriate sulfonamide, e.g.an o alkoxycarbonyl benzenesulfonamide II such as the methyl ester, which is known in the art, an alkyl isocyanate such as butyl isocyanate and a catalytic amount of 1,4 diazat2,2,2 bicyclooctane DABCO in xylene or other inert solvent of sufficiently high boiling point e.g. 1350 is heated to approximately 1350. Phosgene is added to the mixture until an excess of phosgene is present as indicated by a drop in the boiling point. The mixture is heated further to drive off the excess phosgene .After the mixture is cooled and filtered to remove a small amount of insoluble by products, the solvent and alkyl isocyanate are distilled off in vacuo leaving a residue which is the crude sulfonyl isocyanate I. The following Examples are given by way of illustration only. All temperatures are in OC EXAMPLE 1Methyl 2 isocyanatosulfonyl benzoate A stirred mixture containing 157 g of methyl 2 sulfamoylbenzoate, 73 g of butyl isocyanate 0.3 g of 1,4 diazabicyclo 2,2,2 octane and 1.0 t of xylene was heated to reflux for one half hour. Phos gene gas was then passed into the system under a dry ice reflux condenser allowing the reaction temperature to drop to 1200. This addition was continued until the reflux temperature remained at 1200 without further phosgene addition.The temperature of the reaction mixture was then raised to 1360 by removal of the dry ice reflux condenser after which it was cooled to room temperature and filtered. Evaporation of the filtrate yielded the desired crude sulfonyl isocyanate which could be purified by distillation at 132 1380C under 1.0 to 1.1 mm of mercury pressure. The product is extremely reactive with water so contact with moisture should be scrupulously avoided. EXAMPLE 2 Isopropyl 2 isocyanatosulfonyl benzoate To 60.7 g .25 mole of isopropyl 2 sulfamoyl benzoate in 300 ml dry molecular sieves xylenes was added 25.0 g .25 mole N butyl isocyanate and .1 g 1,4 diazabicyclo 2,2,2 octane. The mixture was heated to reflux temperature and phosgene was slowly bubbled through the solution for 2 hours. An infrared spectrum of the reaction mixture indicated formation of the desired sulfonylisocyanate 2250 cm . The resulting cloudy solution was cooled to room temperature and decanted from a small amount of solid impurity. Evaporation of the resulting clear solution yielded the desired crude sulfonyl isocyanate, which was used in subsequent steps without further purification. Analogously to these Examples one may prepare the isocyanates listed in Table I. TABLE IEMI6.1 R R2 R3 CH3 5 F H CH3 5 C1 .
