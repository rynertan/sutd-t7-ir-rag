# Process for preventing polymer buildup in a polymerization reactor.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process of coating the internal surfaces of a polymerization reactor in order to substantially eliminate the buildup of polymer on said surfaces during the polymerization process. There is applied to the surfaces a coating composition containing a straight chain or branched polyaromatic amine dissolved in an aqueous acid solution and thereafter the coated surfaces are flushed or rinsed with water without drying the same.
