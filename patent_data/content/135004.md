# Transplantor provided with seedlings selector.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a transplantor of seedlings useful for supplying seedlings in a controlled state, which is characterized in that seedlings grown in paper tubes which are a mixture of superior and inferior seedlings are placed on a seedlings supplying conveyor 17 and separated into individuals at a certain interval by seedlings separating apparatus 19 26 at the terminal of said convevor. Behind said seedlings separating apparatus 19 26 is a string like belt 28 to support roots and leaves, to which is supplied seedlings obtained by separation. Inferior seedlings free of leaves are fallen onto said string like belt 28 to transfer only superior seedlings. Behind the string like belts is seedlings controlling arraying conveyor 45 rotating at a certain velocity, to which seedlings are transferred. In the vicinity of the seedlings accepting part of said seedlings controlling conveyor 45 is provided with seedl ings detector 60 to control the accumulation of seedlings by rotating seedlings supplying conveyor 17 slower when the seedlings amount on the seedling conveyor increases or by rotating the same faster when the same decreases to transfer the seedling in a controlled state.
