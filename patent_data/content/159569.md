# A copying machine.

## Abstract
A copying machine which develops an electrostatic latent image corresponding to an original image into a toner image, transfers the toner image on the copying paper P and fuses the toner image later on the copying paper P by means of a heating and fusing device 38 , detects types of copying pa pers P to be transferred by the toner image and when the co pying paper P is large in size, a fixed standstill time is ar ranged between the scanning and exposing operation of an original and a restoring operation to a home position is made and a fusing operation is prevented without fail when a temper ature of the heating and fusing device 38 drops below a fus ing temperature.
