# APPARATUS FOR DETERMINING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ELEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SHARED ATTRIBUTES

## Abstract
An attribute matrix AM is tilled from an input device I P with a table indicating, for each of a plurality of elements, which of a set of attributes that element possesses. From this table, a match is calculated for every distinct pair of elements, giving the number of attributes presence or ab sence shared by the two elements, and the matches are stored in a match matrix MM. For each pair of elements, a correlation value is then calculated from the match matrix, giving the degree to which the corresponding two columns or rows of the match matrix are correlated, and stored in a correlation matrix CM. The two elements with the highest correlation are then combined, and the alternate calculation of a fresh match matrix and the associated correlation matrix continued until only two collapsed elements remain. The results are stored in a result list store RLIST, and an output matrix is then generated in a matrix store OM. The contents of the OM are then displayed, in a tree form showing the successive combination, by an output device O P.
