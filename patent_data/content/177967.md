## Description
The present invention relates to a clean room including at least one piece of sanitary equipment, such as a toilet. The clean room may be provided in e.g. an integrated circuit production plant, a food production or processing plant or the like. In a conventional clean room forming part of such a plant, a grating, a punched metal plate or the like is laid on the floor of the room to provide numerous air discharge ports. The air in the room is sucked out of it through the air discharge ports by a fan installed outside the room and is returned into the room through an air filter mounted on the ceiling of the room, so that dust or the like should not stay or accumulate in the room. The dust or the like might thus be prevented from being carried into the plant. However, since a toilet stool, for example, provided as a piece of sanitary equipment in the clean room has a recess on the side surface of the lower part of the toilet stool and is fixed at the bottom on the floor of the clean room by bolts or the like, the circulating air flowing down in the room is disturbed around the toilet stool so that an air flow stays near said recess. If the staying air flow contains dust or the like, the dust or the like is likely to stay and cling to the clothes of the user of the room so that the dust or the like is carried into the plant. If a toilet bowl for urine or a washstand is provided, instead of the toilet stool, in the room, the circulating air flowing down in the room is disturbed because the toilet bowl or the washstand projects from the wall of the room, so that an air flow stays in the room. If the staying air flow contains dust or the like, the dust or the like is likely to stay and accumulate on the top of the toilet bowl or the washstand in particular, fly off again and cling to the clothes of the user of the room so that the dust or the like is carried into the plant. In addition, since a water feeder is manually handled for each of the above mentioned sanitary equipments to supply washing water to the pot shaped portion of the equipment, dirt from the hand of the user is likely to cling to the handling portion of the water feeder, fly off in the form of particles from the handling portion, float in the air and cling to the clothes or the like of the user so that the particles are carried into the plant. US A 3149346 and FR A 2039930 disclose pieces of sanitary equipment which include a main body portion having side surfaces which are illustrated to be close to the vertical. In a first aspect, the present invention aims to provide a clean room arrangement which includes at least one piece of sanitary equipment which does not cause dust or the like to stay in the room. In a second aspect, the present invention aims to provide a clean room arrangement which includes at least one piece of sanitary equipment designed to enable a user to supply washing water without putting a hand into contact with the equipment. The first aspect of the present invention is attained by providing a clean room arrangement comprising The second purpose of the present invention is attained by furnishing the sanitary equipment with a sensor which actuates the opening and closing of a water feeder for supplying washing water to the body of the equipment.

In this embodiment, the operation of the air discharge fan 7 is controlled through a sensor c mentioned below, so that the quantity of the air discharged by the fan is changed in a prescribed time after the start of the operation. In other words, the rotational frequency of the air discharge fan 7 is low while the washing water is discharged from the water ejector 13 and the rotational frequency of the fan is heightened to increase the quantity of the sucked air when hot air is blown off from a blowoff port 14 mentioned below. The water ejector 13 for washing the hands of the user of the sanitary equipment, the blowoff port 14 for drying the already washed hands and the sensor c for control both the washing and the drying are provided through the cover a20. A water ejection pipe 15 ramified from the secondary side of the water feeder b for supplying the washing water to the water passage a9 is connected to the upper end of the water ejector 13. The lower end of the ejector 13 is protruded in the cover a20 so that the drops of the washing water supplied from the water feeder b do not fly out of the equipment body a . An air feed pipe 8 is connected to the blowoff port 14. An air feed fan 9 is provided in the halfway portion of the air feed pipe 8 so that the air inside or outside the chamber furnished with the sanitary equipment is rapidly blown off from the port 14. A heater 10 and an air filter 11 such as a sterilizing filter for removing dust or the like from the air and removing oxides or the like flying off from the surface of the heater are sequentially provided downstream to the air feed fan 9. The sensor c is a conventional photoelectric infrared sensor, which sends a detection signal to a controller 16 when the user of the sanitary equipment has inserted his hands into the pot shaped portion a3 through the open portion a15. The controller 16 is electrically connected to the water feeder b , the air discharge fan 7, the sensor c , the air feed fan 9 and the heater 10. When the user of the washstand has inserted his hands into the pot shaped portion a3 through the open portion a15, washing water is discharged from the ejection holes a12 of the water passage a9 to make a water film on the inside surface of the pot shaped portion, other washing water is jetted as a shower bath from the water ejector 13 to wash the hands of the user, and the air in the pot shaped portion is evacuated out of it. When the discharge and the jetting of the washing water and the evacuation of the air are stopped, hot air is rapidly blown off from the blowoff port 14 to remove water drops from the hands to dry them, and the quantity of the air sucked through the air discharge passage a21 is increased to suck dust or the like flying off from the hand washing user and his clothes, to evacuate the air and the dust or the like to the exterior of the chamber furnished with the sanitary equipment. Although the quantity of the air sucked by the air discharge fan 7 is changed in a prescribed time in the above mentioned embodiment, the rotation of the fan 7 may be started at the same time as the blowoff of the hot air from the blowoff port 14.
