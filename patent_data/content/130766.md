# Multiple axis ring laser gyroscopes.

## Abstract
In a multiple axis ring laser gyroscope in which one or more of the laser cavity corner mirrors is or are shared by different cavities and in which the laser beams in these different cavities operate at the same nominal frequency, scattering of the beam in one cavity into another cavity by the shared mirror s may produce disadvantageous lock in effects. To at least lessen this possibility, the frequencies of the beams in the gyroscope disclosed herein are offset one from another, the offset being sufficient to affect lock in but not so great that the frequency of any beam is overly far from the lasing medium gain curve centre. The frequency offsets may be produced by introducing offset bias signals into some channels of the gyroscope path length control servosystem.
