# ELECTRODIALYSIS APPARATUS FOR THE CHEMICAL MAINTENANCE OF ELECTROLESS COPPER PLATING BATHS

## Abstract
Apparatus for preventing depletion of an electroless copper plating bath 66 comprises an electrolytic cell 26 divided by permselective membranes 38,40 into a catholyte compartment 28 , an anolyte compartment 32 and be tween them an electroless copper solution compartment 36 . A catholyte such as aqueous sodium hydroxide is circulated to and from the catholyte compartment from a source 62 by a pump 54 . An anolyte such as aqueous sulphuric acid is circulated to and from the anolyte compart ment 32 from a source 60 by a pump 58 and the electroless copper solution is circulated from the plating bath 66 to the copper solution compartment 36 of the cell and back, by a pump 68 .
