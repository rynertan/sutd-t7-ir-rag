# System for power supply to and switching of a number of electrical appliances.

## Abstract
System for power supply to and switching of a number of electrical appliances connected to a power source. Each electrical appliance is provided with a switching part, which is connected to a common signal line, to which are further connected a clock pulse generator and a number of signal transmitters, each of which corresponds with the switching part of a particular appliance. When a signal transmitter is activated, a control signal characteristic to the corresponding switching part is generated by extending up to the next clock pulse a number of clock pulses in a combination characterizing the control signal. The switching part addressed by the characteristic control signal then switches its particular electrical appliance the switching parts of the other appliances are not activated by the signal. The address is determined by selective grounding in the same combination of a number of address contacts in the switching part and the associated signal transmitter.
