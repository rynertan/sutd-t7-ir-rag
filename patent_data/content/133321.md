# DNA gene, process for production thereof and plasmid containing the same.

## Abstract
A DNA i gene comprising a DNA ii portion corresponding to the gene coding for a signal peptide, said DNA ii portion having one restriction endonuclease recognition site artificially created with at least one base pair of said DNA ii as at least a part of the members constituting said recognition site is dis closed. Also disclosed is a method of production of the DNA in which one restriction endonuclease recognition site is artificially created by modifying the base sequence of the DNA ii portion without changing the amino acid sequence corresponding to the base sequence in utilization of degeneracy of codons. Plasmid comprising the DNA ii portion corresponding to the gene coding for the signal peptide derive from the alkaline phosphatase is also disclosed.
