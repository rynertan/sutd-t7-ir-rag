# MACHINE FOR MAKING ICE CUBES

## Abstract
A machine for making ice cubes includes an arrangement which first uses water, which is to be introduced into a tray to be frozen therein to form ice cubes, to activate the tray so as to cause previously formed ice cubes to be ejected from the tray. Then the water is permitted to flow in a direction to the tray, while the tray returns to a position to receive the flowing water.
