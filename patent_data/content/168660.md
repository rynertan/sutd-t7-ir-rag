# MAGNETIC RECORDING REPRODUCING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A magnetic recording reproducing apparatus of small size, small weight, and suitable for incorporation into a child s toy or the like. A magnetic disc is supported on a shaft, the latter being driven rotationally by a wind up spring. A governor is provided for controlling the releasing force of the spring to thereby cause the disc to be rotated at a constant speed. A magnetic head is moved linearly and radially along the disc in synchronism with the rotation of the disc supporting shaft and in sliding contact with the disc. A spring biased mode changeover member is provided for selecting between the recording and reproducing modes, the mode changeover member being normally urged to the reproducing mode position.
