# Process for diagnosing and detecting cancer in the breasts of females.

## Abstract
A diagnostic process is disclosed for detecting very early or developed stages of malignancy of tissue beneath a predetermined portion of the skin of a human patient. A sample of body secretion is obtained from the outer surface of the skin and is tested for presence of markedly decreased free, naturally occurring amino acids. The test has ap proximately the same order of sensitivity as a standard ninhydren test. Presence of free amino acids indicates healthy tissue underlying the skin area examined. Markedly decreased amino acids indicates that an incipient or de veloped malignancy is disposed below the skin. The diag nostic process of the invention is particularly adapted for mass screening of human females for early stages of breast cancer.
