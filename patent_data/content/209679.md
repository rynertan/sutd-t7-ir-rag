## Description
This invention relates to a polyolefin resin composition having highly flame retardant properties and superior heavy metal deterioration resistance, heat deterioration resistance and weather resistance and when molded, affording a molded product having an excellent appearance. More particularly it relates to a flame retardant polyolefin resin composition having a halogen containing flame retardant, antimony trioxide, a crosslinking agent, a specified thiophosphite and if necessary, a specified processing aid, blended with a polyolefin resin, and having superior heavy metal deterioration resistance, heat deterioration resistance, weather resistance, highly flame retardant properties, and drip preventing properties and superior processability, and when molded, affording a molded product having a superior appearance. Since polyolefin resins are superior in processability, chemical resistance, weather resistance, electric characteristics, they have been very often used in various fields including fields of parts of domestic electric products. On the other hand, however, the resins have drawbacks that they are very readily combustible, and when burnt, once liquefy due to thermal decomposition, and then there occurs dropping of ignited droplets or non ignited droplets and falling down of combustion pieces hereinafter such dropping materials and falling down materials will be referred to as drip and the properties of causing the drip will be referred to as dripping properties . The presence or absence of this drip is one of the important factors at the time of evaluating flame retardant properties of the resins, and if the drip is present, their flame retardant properties are ranked low even when the self extinguishing properties are superior. As described above, improvement in the dripping properties is one of the serious problems in the art of making the resins flame retardant. Thus, for making polyolefin resins flame retardant, various proposals have so far been made. As general processes for making the resins flame retardant, addition of an organic halogen containing flame retardant, antimony trioxide and a salt of a higher fatty acid with a specified metal to polyolefin resins Japanese patent publication No. Sho 51 25061 1976 , addition of a nitrogen containing compound or a hydrous inorganic compound as a flame retardant to polyolefin resins have been carried out. However, products obtained by merely adding an organic halogen containing flame retardant to polyolefin resins are superior in the self extinguishing properties at the time of combustion, but they have a drawback of causing drip at the time of combustion. Further, products obtained by adding a hydrous inorganic compound such as magenesium hydroxide as a flame retardant to polyolefin resins are superior in the dripping properties and also have self extinguishing properties to a certain extent, but in order to impart a highly flame retardant effectiveness, it is necessary to add a large quantity of the inorganic compound to polyolefin resins thus polyolefin resin compositions obtained by adding a large quantity of the inorganic compound have a drawback that their molding processability deteriorates due to reduction in the fluidity of the melt and the mechanical strength of molded products obtained by molding the compositions lowers hence the practical quantity thereof added is limited in the aspect of physical properties and it is difficult to make the resins highly flame retardant. In order to overcome these drawbacks, a process of using a bromine containing flame retardant and a boron fluoride salt together with polypropylene Japanese patent application laid open No. Sho 54 163937 1979 , a process of blending a silicon modified ethylene propylene rubber and a flame retardant with a polyethylene resin, followed by crosslinking the blend with an organic peroxide Japanese patent application laid open No. Sho 55 110139 1980 , a process of adding a silane coupling agent, an ethylene propylene rubber, chlorinated polyethylene and a flame retardant to a polyethylene resin, followed by molding the mixture and exposing the resulting molded product to water to effect crosslinking Japanese patent application laid open No. Sho 55 45716 1980 , and other processes have been disclosed. Further, a flame retardant rubber composition obtained by blending an organic flame retardant, a poly functional compound, a cyclic compound having a specified structure, a mineral powder and an organic peroxide with an ethylene propylene copolymer rubber has been disclosed Japanese patent application laid open No. Sho 56 90845 1981 has been disclosed. The present inventors have made extensive research in order to obtain a polyolefin resin composition which improves dripping properties, has highly flame retardant properties and when molded, affords a molded product having an excellent appearance, and as a result, have found that a composition obtained by blending with a polyolefin resin, definite quantities of a halogen containing flame retardant, antimony trioxide, a crosslinking agent and a specified thiophosphite or a composition further having a processing aid blended therein affords, when molded, a molded product having highly flame retardant properties, no dripping properties, a smooth surface and an excellent appearance, and superior heavy metal deterioration resistance, heat deterioration resistance and weather resistance, and have completed the present invention based on this finding. As apparent from the foregoing, the object of the present invention is to provide a flame retardant polyolefin resin composition which, when molded, affords a molded product having highly flame retardant properties, no dripping properties, a good processability, a smooth surface and an excellent appearance and superior resistances to heavy metal deterioration, heat deterioration and weather. The present invention in a first aspect resides in a flame retardant polyolefin resin composition consisting of The present invention in a second aspect resides in a flame retardant polyolefin resin composition having 0.02 to 1 part by weight of 2 t butyl 6 3 t butyl 2 hydroxy 5 methylbenzyl 4 methylphenyl acrylate blended with 100 parts by weight of a resin composition consisting of The halogen containing flame retardant used in the present invention refers to organic halogenated compounds having a melting point of 270 C or higher. Examples of bromine containing flame retardants are decabromodiphenyl oxide, hexabromobenzene, and ethylenebistetrabromophthalimide. An examples of chlorine containing flame retardants is perchloropentacyclodecane. The blending proportion of the halogen containing flame retardant is 5 to 60 by weight, preferably 10 to 30 by weight. If the blending proportion is less than 5 by weight, the resulting flame retardant properties are insufficient, and it does not matter if the proportion exceeds 60 by weight, but there is no improvement in the flame retardant effectiveness corresponding to the excess proportion and also the cost increases as much. The quantity of antimony trioxide blended in the present invention is in the range of 100 to 10 by weight, preferably 70 to 20 by weight based on the weight of the halogen containing flame retardant used. If the quantity exceeds 100 by weight, the whiteness is so intense that when the composition is intended to have a desired color, this color is difficultly developed. Further, if the quantity is less than 10 by weight, the synergistic effect of antimony trioxide with the halogen containing flame retardant cannot be expected. As the crosslinking agent used in the present invention, polyfunctional monomers, oxime nitroso compounds, maleimide compounds, etc. are mentioned. Concrete examples are triallylcyanurate, triallylisocyanurate, di ethylene glycol di meth acrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, trimethylol ethylene triacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate, pantaerythritol tetraacrylate, divinylbenzene, diallyl phthalate, divinylpyridine, quinone dioxime, benzoquinone dioxime, p nitrosophenol and N,N m phenylenebismaleimide. Among these, polyfunctional meth acrylic acid esters such as trimethylolpropane tri meth acrylate and pentaerythritol triacrylate are preferred. Further, the blending proportion of the crosslinking agent is in the range of 0.5 to 15 by weight, preferably 1 to 7 by weight. If the proportion is less than 0.5 by weight, there is almost no drip preventing effect at the time of combustion, while it does not matter if the proportion exceeds 15 by weight, but there is no more improvement in the drip preventing effect, that is, such excess is meaningless. Examples of the above thiophosphites expressed by the formulas I , II , III and IV are trilauryltrithiophosphite, tridecyltrithiophosphite, tribenzyltrithiophosphite, tricyclohexyltrithiophosphite, tri 2 ethylhexyl trithiophosphite, trinaphthyltrithiophosphite, diphenyldecyltrithiophosphite, diphenyllauryltrithiophosphite, tetralauryl 4 oxaheptylene 1,7 tetrathiophosphite, tetrakis mercaptolauryl 1,6 dimercaptohexylenediphosphite, pentakis mercaptolauryl bis 1,6 hexylene dimercapto trithiophosphite, tetrakis mercaptolauryl 2,9 dimercapto para menthylenediphosphite, bis mercaptolauryl 1,6 dimercaptohexylene bis benzenephosphite , tetrakis mercaptolauryl 2,9 dimercapto para menthylenediphosphite, dioctyldithiopentaerythritoldiphosphite, dilauryldithiopentaerythritoldiphosphite, phenyllauryldithiopentaerythritoldiphosphite and mixtures of two or more of the foregoing. The blending proportion of the thiophosphite is in the range of 0.05 to 5 by weight, preferably 0.1 to 2 by weight. If the proportion is less than 0.05 by weight, the drip preventing effect is poor, while even if it exceeds 5 by weight, there is no improvement in the drip preventing effect, and hence such excess is meaningless. Examples of the polyolefin resin used in the present invention are crystalline propylene homopolymer, crystalline copolymers of propylene as main component with one kind or more selected from ethylene, butene 1, pentene 1, hexene 1, 4 methylpentene 1, heptene 1, octene 1 and decene 1, low density polyethylene, medium density polyethylene, high density polyethylene, ethylene propylene rubber, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, styrene butadiene copolymer and mixtures of two kinds or more of the foregoing. Among these, propylene homopolymer and propylene ethylene random copolymer and propylene ethylene block copolymer, each composed mainly of propylene, are particularly preferred. Further, blends of such polymers with ethylene propylene rubber, polyethylene, etc. may also be used. The processing aid used in the present invention is 2 t butyl 6 3 t butyl 2 hydroxy 5 methylbenzyl 4 methylphenyl acrylate, and its blending proportion is in the range of 0.02 to 1 part by weight, preferably 0.1 to 1 part by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the resin composition obtained by blending with a polyolefin resin, specified quantities of a halogen containing flame retardant, antimony trioxide, a crosslinking agent and a thiophosphite selected from the compounds expressed by the formulas I , II , III and IV . If the quantity of the processing aid blended is less than 0.02 part by weight, the processability improving effect is poor, while it does not matter if the quantity exceeds 1 part by weight, but the processability improving effect has been satisfied and the cost increases and hence such excess is uneconomical. In the composition of the present invention, additives usually added to polyolefin resins may be used together therewith such as antioxidant, antistatic agent, lubricant, pigment and inorganic filler e.g. calcium carbonate, talc, clay, mica, magnesium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide, glass fibers, various kinds of metal powder, metal fiber, borax and borofluorides. The preparation of the composition of the present invention has no particular limitation, but definite quantities of the above components A , B , C , D and E or A , B , C , D , E and the processing aid are placed in mixer such as Henschel mixer tradename , super mixer or the like, followed by mixing these materials with stirring and melt kneading by rolls, extruder or the like means and pelletizing to obtain the composition. The melt kneading temperature is in the range of 170 to 250 C, preferably 180 230 C. The molded product obtained by molding the composition of the present invention has highly flame retardant properties causes no drip at the time of its combustion are superior in heavy metal deterioration resistance, heat deterioration resistance and weather resistance and has a smooth surface, a superior appearance and a good processability. Whereas, in the case of compositions obtained by blending with a polyolefin resin, a halogen containing flame retardant, antimony trioxide, a crosslinking agent and an organic peroxide, the organic peroxide is decomposed by melt kneading at the time of granulation to generate radicals and cause crosslinking reaction. As a result, the resulting pellets contain a crosslinked product hence when such pellets are molded into a desired molded product, such a molded product has a roughened surface to notably reduce its commodity value, or when they are molded into a desired molded product, crosslinking reaction proceeds and the resulting molded product has a roughened surface to reduce its commodity value the drip preventing effect is also insufficient and the heavy metal deterioration resistance, heat deterioration resistance and weather resistance notably lower as compared with the case where the composition of the present invention is used. The molded product obtained from the composition of the present invention has no dripping properties and has a smooth surface and a superior appearance. This is considered to be due to the fact that the thiophosphite used in the present invention does not generate any radical by decomposition at a temperature of 250 C or lower, unlike general organic peroxides, and hence there occurs no crosslinking reaction during the melt kneading at the time of granulation and molding processing thus the resulting molded product has a superior appearance, while it is decomposed a higher temperatures as in the case of the time of combustion to generate radicals and thereby promote crosslinking reaction hence it has a function of preventing drip of combustion pieces. The present invention will be described in more detail by way of Examples and Comparative examples. In addition, the evaluation methods therein were carried out according to the following Same test pieces of 127 mm long, 12.7 mm wide and 0.8 mm thick were prepared according to injection molding method, and each five of the test pieces as one set were subjected to burning test. The test pieces were fixed at the upper ends thereof and vertically hung in a chamber wherein air was still. Using a commercial methane gas having a heating value of 37 MJ m³ as a gas for combustion, a flame from a Bunsen burner having an inner diameter of 9.5 mm adjusted so as to occasion a blue flame of 19 mm long was applied to the test pieces at the lower ends thereof for 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, the burner was removed, followed by measuring the period of time during which the test pieces were flaming. The periods of time were recorded as a first combustion time in Table 1. Just after flame out of the test pieces, the blue flame of the burner was applied again to the test pieces at the lower ends thereof in the same manner as above, for 10 seconds to measure the period of time from the combustion till the flame out of the test pieces. The periods of times were recorded as a second combustion time. Further the period of time during which the pieces were successively glowing, was also measured and recorded as glowing time. Cotton was placed 305 mm below the test pieces, and it was observed and recorded whether there was a drip during the burning test and also whether the cotton ignited by the drip. The above burning test was carried out with 5 test pieces each one test. The maximum time among the first combustion times and the second ones in the burning test with the 5 test pieces was recorded as the maximum combustion time, and the total time of the first combustion time and the second one with the 5 test pieces was recorded as the total combustion time. Further, the maximum time among the glowing times in the burning test with the 5 test pieces was recorded as the maximum glowing time. From the results of the above burning test, the flame retardant properties were judged, evaluated and classified according to the following standards A test piece of 50 mm long, 25 mm wide and 1 mm thick was prepared according to injection molding method, and tested at 160 C according to JIS K7212. It was judged whether the heat deterioration resistance was good or not, from the number of days which lapsed by the date on which occurrence of cracks or fractures in the test piece was observed by the naked eye. A test piece of 50 mm long, 25 mm wide and 1 mm thick was prepared according to injection molding method, and a copper sheet of 30 mm long, 20 mm wide and 0.3 mm thick having the surface sufficiently polished was adhered and fixed onto the test piece, followed by placing the resulting material in an oven at 150 C, to judge whether the heavy metal deterioration resistance is superior or inferior, from the number of days which lapsed by the date of occurrence of cracks or fractures in the test piece. according to JIS K7210 according to JIS K7110. The presence or absence of roughened surface, melt fracture and spot on the surface of the molded product was observed by the naked eye and evaluated.

The respective resulting blends were subjected to melt knead extruding by means of a twin screw extruder having a bore diameter of 45 mm at a melt kneading temperature of 200 C, and pelletized. Comparative examples 1 5 The respective blending components were mixed so as to give blending compositions described in Table 1, followed by adding an antioxidant and a neutralizing agent in the same manner as in Examples 1 3, and blending these with stirring, melt knead extruding and pelletizing in the same manner as in Examples 1 3. The pellets obtained in the above Examples and Comparative examples were respectively dried at 100 C for 3 hours, followed by subjecting the resulting pellets to injection molding at a resin temperature of 250 C by means of an injection molding machine, into definite test pieces, which were then subjected to burning test, Izod impact test and tests of heavy metal deterioration resistance, heat deterioration resistance and weather resistance. Further, the melt flow rate of the resulting pellets was measured and the surface appearance of the resulting test pieces was observed by the naked eye and evaluated. The results are collectively shown in Table 1. A propylene homopolymer having a melt flow rate of 10 was used as a polyolefin resin various blending components were blended so as to give a blending composition described in Table 1 an antioxidant and a neutralizing agent were added as in Examples 1 3 and blending with stirring, melt knead extruding and pelletizing were carried out as in Examples 1 3. Various blending components were blended so as to give a blending composition described in Table 1 an antioxidant and a neutralizing agents were added as in Examples 1 3 and blending with stirring, melt knead extruding and pelletizing were carried out as in Examples 1 3. The pellets obtained in Example 4 and Comparative example 6 were respectively dried at 100 C for 3 hours, followed by subjecting them to injection molding at a resin temperature of 250 C by means of an injection molding machine to prepare definite test pieces, which were then subjected to burning test, Izod impact test, and tests of heavy metal deterioration resistance, heat deterioration resistance and weather resistance. Further, the melt flow rate of the resulting pellets was measured and the surface appearance of the test pieces was observed and evaluated by naked eye. These results are collectively shown in Table 1. An ethylene propylene block copolymer ethylene content 12 by weight, melt flow rate 10 was used as a polyolefin resin blending components were mixed so as to give blending compositions described in Table 2 an antioxidant and a neutralizing agent were then added as in Examples 1 3 and blending with stirring, melt knead extruding and pelletizing were carried out as in Examples 1 3. Blending components were mixed so as to give blending compositions described in Table 2 an antioxidant and a neutralizing agent were added as in Examples 1 3 and blending with stirring, melt knead extruding and pelletizing were carried out as in Examples 1 3. The respective pellets obtained in Examples 5 7 and Comparative examples 7 and 8 were dried at 100 C for 3 hours, followed by subjecting the pellets to injection molding at a resin temperature of 250 C by means of an injection molding machine, into definite test pieces, and carrying out burning test, Izod impact test, heavy metal deteriration resistance test and heat deterioration resistance test. Further, the melt flow rate of the pellets was measured and the surface appearance of the test pieces was observed and evaluated by the naked eye. The results are collectively shown in Table 2. As apparent from Table 1, all of the molded products obtained in Examples 1 3 had a smooth surface appearance and also a sufficient Izod impact strength. Further, as to their flame retardant properties, too, all of the maximum combustion times were 10 seconds or less and all of the total combustion times were 30 seconds or less and also no drip occurred. Further, their heavy metal deterioration resistance and heat deterioration resistance were much superior. As to Comparative examples 1 and 2 wherein the thiophosphite among the blending composition of the present invention was replaced by an organic peroxide, the resulting molded products had a surface roughened appearance and glistening spots, and in the case of Comparative example 2, such phenomena were more notable hence in both the cases, their utility was far inferior. Further, drip was observed, and it was found that their heavy metal deterioration resistance and heat deterioration resistance, too, were far inferior to those in Examples 1 3. Further, Comparative example 3 is directed to a composition excluding thiophosphite in contrast to the present invention, and it is seen therefrom that drip is observed and also heavy metal deterioration resistance is far inferior to those of Examples 1 3. In the case of Comparative example 4 using a composition deficient in the crosslinking agent used in the composition of the present invention, the Izod impact strength was lower, drip was observed and heavy metal deterioration resistance and heat deterioration resistance were also inferior. In the case of Comparative example 5 using a composition deficient in the crosslinking agent and thiophosphite used in the composition of the present invention, it was found that the Izod impact strength was lower drip was observed and heavy metal deterioration resistance and heat deterioration resistance were also inferior, as in the case of Comparative example 4 thus, practical problems were raised. In the case of Example 4 wherein the same blending composition as in Example 1 was employed except that a propylene homopolymer having a melt flow rate of 10 was used in the polyolefin resin, it was found that the appearance was smooth the flame retardant properties were superior no drip was observed and heavy metal deterioration resistance and heat deterioration resistance were also superior thus the composition had a sufficient utility. In the case of Comparative example 6 having a composition deficient in the crosslinking agent and thiophosphite used in the composition of the present invention, drip was observed and the heavy metal deterioration resistance and the heat deterioration resistance were also far inferior to those in the case of Example 4. Further, as apparent from Table 2, in the case of Comparative example 7 wherein mica 10 by weight was used together with magnesium hydroxide both as an inorganic filler, the resulting composition had a melt index extremely lowered down to 0.14 so that the processability became inferior thus spots were observed on the surface of the molded product. Whereas in the case of Example 5 wherein 0.3 part by weight of a processing aid was blended beside the above two fillers, and also in the case of Example 6 wherein 0.6 part by weight of the processing aid was blended beside the above two fillers, the resulting compositions had melt flow rates as high as 3.9 and 7.9 respectively, so that their processability was superior and the resulting molded product had a smooth surface. Further, in the case of Comparative example 8 wherein 2 by weight of carbon black was added as a coloring agent, the melt flow rate of the resulting composition lowered down to 2.0, whereas in the case of Example 7 wherein 0.1 part by weight of a processing aid was also blended, the composition had a melt flow rate of 5.4 and exhibited a superior processability. As described above, the molded products using the composition of the present invention have highly flame retardant properties cause no drip have superior heavy metal deterioration resistance and heat deterioration resistance have a smooth surface and a superior appearance and also have a superior weather resistance. Further, the molded products obtained by using the compositions of the present invention,having added processing aid,are also provided with superior heavy metal detorioration resistance and heat detorioration resistance as in the case of the molded products of Table 1.
