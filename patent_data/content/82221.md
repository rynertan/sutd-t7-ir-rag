## Description
This invention relates to an edge protector for electrodes, e.g. cathode matrix plates ns are used in the electrodeposition of metal and, more particularly, in the production of electrodeposits upon, and their subsequent integral detachment from, so called mastercathodes or matrices in the form of flat plates or sheets, as practised in such processes as electroforming, electrolytic extraction t electrowinningn and refining of metals.Though by no means confined thereto3 the invention is especially relevant to the production of so called starting sheets in electrowinning and electrorefining of such metals as copper, zinc, nickel and cobalt. Thus, for example, a copper starting sheet serves as the cathode in the production of electrolytic copper, forming the nucleus of the electrodeposited end product. This starting sheet is itself produced.by electro deposition onto a matrix plate from which it is detached the matrix is then re used again and again, for as many cycles as possible.If made of titanium as often is the case , the matrix is expensive so that it is important to avoid its being damaged during the stripping of the..elec,trodeposited starting sheet For economic reasons, the stripping process needs to be carried out quickly, so as to speed the recycling of the matrices. When the electrodeposit is not readily detachable, the process is slowed down, at best, but may result ,in large numbers of starting sheets being torn or deformed and, at worst, the.valuable matrix may itself be damaged and rendered unserviceable in the stripping process. A typical matrix plate may be 3mm 1 8 thick, measuring in its immersed portion some 40 x 40 ca. im x lm so that each side produces a starting sheet of some 11ft.Ãª ca. lm2 in area.It will be seen, therefore, that the stripping process is rendered mor.e.difficult when the electrodeposit extends over the vertical edges of the matrix plate, so that a continuous layer surrounds the matrix in the horizontal plane the bottom edge.creates no such problems by itself, if the vertical edges are kept bare, the deposit joining back and front layers across the horizontal bottom edge is simply trimmed off to produce the two separate starting sheets it is usual practice to provide a V ndtche d grobVe along the 3mm wide downward facing base of the matrix plate, and to operate with andde,s which are significantly shorter in length than the matrix cathodes.The electrodeposit reaching the apex of the inverted V notch is, therefore, extremely thin and readily fractures in a straight line along the apex of the groove when the deposited starting sheets on front and back of the matrix plate are stripped therefrom and folded away from the plate, using the apex line of the groove as the folding axis.Protection of the, grooved base of .the matrix plate is required only in special cases e.g. when there would be adhesion of the deposit within the groove in processes using other than inherently superficially passive ,matrix plates i.e., other than, e.g. titanium . A number of so called edge protectors have been proposed to prevent metal deposition at the vertical edges of the matrix plate but none of these devices has remained effective for more than but a relatively few cycles, and partial break down of such a protector can create additional hazards of damage to electrodeposit and or matrix during the stripping process.Moreover, waste material from lace ,edges of the deposit requiresre melt ing which is wasteful of ene rgy and inconvenient. Conventiona l stop off coatings are porous especially at the rela tively sha rp edge of .the titanium plate, where such dipped or painted coatings are thinnest , and if thickly applied, their adhesion is. inadequate..Rubber and 6r plastic edge strips was hitherto proposed all rely upon the intrinsic elasticity or springineSs , of the material to provide an effective seal ,onto the matrix plate to prevent the electrolyte from penetrating these edge strips are of U. profile, resembling edge trim on a motor car door surround etc one type proposed is made up of twin U sections, a soft inner one presumably to overcome surface irregularities on the rolled titanium sheet with a stiff outer U intended to act as a clamp to ensure sealing in all these cases, the effect of the ele ctroly te temperature of some 600C or.more, and applied over prolonged periods has resulted in break down, the materials used softened and or ,tbeir ela sticity was progressively reduced, and this, added to the considerable differential in the respective coefficients of thermal expansion of the plastic and the titanium, resulted in break down of the seal. The electrolyte is very searching, and metal seeds are deposited wherever seepage occurs these seeds grow apace, and total break down of the edge ins ulation becomes inevitable.Moreover, there was the added hazard of the operators knife slipping during the stripping process, dislddging the edge s,trip. This hazard is a drawback also when adhesive tape is used for edge insulation. The adhesive also loses its efficiency, but there are reports that polyester based adhesive tape can remain effective for some 20 30 cycles. In large operations, however, ,it would not be economical to re apply adhesive tape after only 20 30 cycles. Edge protection is especially important in processes such as the recently developed iSA,Process , described at the 110th A.I.M.E. Annual Meeting in Chicago, Ill., U.S.A., on February 23, 1981 where starting sheets are dispensed with, and detachable thick copper cathodes weighing 45kg each, 90kg per pair are deposited onto nickel plated stainless steel matrices.Here, vertical edge strips of extruded C,ycoloy 800 plastic are fixed to the matrices by means of plastic pins passing. through holes drilled in the matrix, and sealing is effected by means of a sacrificial layer of high melting point wax, which is also applied to the base of the matrix plate this waxing process is carried out for each electrodeposition cycle, the process is laborious and requires special machines both for the application and the recovery of the wax.

According to the present invention an edge protector for electrodes, comprises first and second elongate elements, both elements being of superficially electrically insulating material, the first element having a generally H shaped cross section so as to provide open slots on opposite sides, one slot defined between a pair of outer jaws and the other slot defined between a pair of inner jaws, a bare or suitably gasketed edge of an electrode being insertable into and located within the inner jaws, and the second element being constituted by a member so dimensioned as to be an interference fit wi,th the outer jaws whereby the outer jaws are forced further apart with the result that the outer jaws endeavour to close the liner zaws which are levered towards one another, thereby to exert pressure upon the surface of the electrode, either directly or through any gasket, located within the inner jaws to form a seal to prevent electrolyte from wetting the edge of the electrode located within the inner jaws. Th u s, the edge protector of the present invention, unlike the aforementioned prior art proposals operates without recourse to the fl5pringinessll of its material of construction, nor to the use of adhesives or painted on layers other than for the purpose of compensating for surface irregularities as in the manner of a gasket and its efficiency is unimpaired by the effects of thermal expansion a number of materials which need not he identical for both elements may be utilised for its construction, and the type selected mustf of.course, remain unaffected chemically and thermally, by the process environment, The principle of operation is simple leverage which not only produces but sustains the necessary forces to maintain efficiency and resistance to dislocation, thus overcoming the shortcomings of existing devices as described in the foregoing. One or both elongate elements of the edge protector may be made wholly of electrically insulating material, or may be enshrouded in electrically insulating material, e.g. by being made principally of metal with a central, metal core. The two elongate elements of the edge protector may be of substantially equal length as appropriate for the size of the electrode concerned, and made of suitable rigid insulating material, e.g. polypropylene, e.g.by injection moulding. Alternatively, the second element may comprise a multiplicity of elongate pieces, the sum total of their combined lengths being substantially equal to the length of the first element of the edge protector. The second element may be of polygonal, circular or oval cross section and its total effective length may be made up from more than one piece interspaced at not more than 5mm when assembled within the outer jaws of the first element. A rubber mallet may be used to force the second element into the outer jaws, these being shaped so as to retain the second element securely within the outer jaws.Furthermore, the second element may be of a material having a greater coefficient of thermal expansion than the material of the first element whereby the leverage action on the inner jaws is enhanced, if as is often the case, the electrode matrix is, in use, employed at elevated temperatures. The invention also includes an electrode, of either polarity, provided with edge protectors as defined above, e.g. a cathode matrix plate or an insoluble anode. The invention further includes electrodeposits and or products of electrolysis manufactured by employing electrodes as defined above. In detail, the inner jaws may be so proportioned as to accept the edge of the electrode, inserted therein to a depth of say 8 lO m, the gap width being just adequate to accommodate the thickness of the electrode, a so called friction fit.Where the electrode s as rolled surface has irregularities, the edge may, with advantage, be gasketed,e.g. by a suitable adhesive tape, such as polyester tape with termosetting adhesive, applied to the portion of the electrode at and adjacent to the edge which is to be subsequently inserted into the inner jaws. It will be realised that the said H ,configuration is in effect two levers viz., the verticals of the hug , with the fulcrum plane represented by the horizontal cross bar of the H . It is a further advantage that this edge protector by itself, or serving as a structural support for attachment of supplementary devices may be utilised.to facilitate precise location of an electrode in the form of a cathode within the cell and or relative to the anode, both in precision plating processes and for the purpose of preventing accidental short circuits.Moreover, the edge protector may also be utilised with insoluble anode plates, providing a convenient support for the attachment of e.g. anode shields, bipolar or auxiliary electrodes etc. Although primarily intended for use attached to the vertical immersed edge of cathode matrix plate, the edge protector is equally suitable for attachment to the plate s horizontal bottom edge when this is required.The two elongate elements of the edge protector may have such longitudinal dimensions as to protrude beyond the immersed length or breadth of the electrode to which edge protectors are fitted. A piece of compressible and elastic or springy material such as nitrile rubber or neoprene ca. 3.5mm thick and some 9mm square may be entrapped within the protruding inne,r jaws so as to be in close contact with the 3mm 1 8 wide bare or taped bottom edge of the electrode within the inner jaws to prevent metal.deposition on that portion if bare or to maintain close adhesion thereto of tape, if tape is employed as aforesaid. The said protrusions may serve for the additional purposes of locating an electrode plate in a cell and or maintaining inter electrode distance therein and or act as structural supports serving the said and or other purposes, and the said protrusions also protect the bottom edge of the electrode plate when this has to be stood upright on the floor outside the cell during repairs or maintenance to equipment such as conveyors etc.The protruding ends of these vertical edge protectors of an electrode plate may also be interconnected by means of a member passing below the horizontal base of the plate. The said connecting member may be so designed and constructed as to serve any of the additional purposes as already referred to, and or to protect the plate s horizontal bottom edge or merely its downward facing base. Depending upon the intended purpose of the said member, it may be attached to, the vertical protrusions by means of permanent fixture, or it may be hinged at one end and detachably fastened at the other end, or it may be.attached in such a manner as to be readily detachable from the vertical protrusions when required. , Fixing methods depending upon the members shape in profile, etc. include, e.g. mitred joints which may be welded, or gussetted and pinned or bolted, or clamping the ends of the said member within the inner zaws of the protrusions of the vertical edge protectors. In those special cases usually confined to electroforming and or precision plating where it is necessary to protect all four edges of a plate, the latter may be inserted into a U ,frame formed of two.vertical and one horizontal edge protector as hereinbefore described with mitred and welded joins at the corners of the base of the U . A fourth edge protector is clamped onto the top edge of the plate usually allowing a gap for attachment of the electrical conductor thereto.The said protrusions of vertical edge protectors fitted to an electrode plate may thus readily be used in a number of different ways.to provide anchor points for attachment of protectors of one or both horizontal edges of the plate. The invention will now be described in greater detail, by way of exzmple, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a side elevation of an electrode in accordance with one aspect of the invention provided with edge protectors in accordance with another aspect of the invention and immersed in a cell Figure 2 is an.enlarged section on the line II II of Figure 1 Figure 3 is an enlarged view in the direction of arrow III of Figure 1 Figure 4 is a part section on the line IV IV.of Figure 3 and Figure 5 corresponds to Figure 3 but illustrates the manner of assembly. In the drawings, a cathode matrix plate 1 is illustrated immersed in electrolyte the surface of which is indicated at 2, the plate 1 being generally rectangular and provided, at an upper edge 3 above the electrode surface 2 with a plurality of electrical conductors 4 leading to an electrode bar not hows of the cell.The plate 1 also has a horizontal bottom edge 5 and opposed vertical edges 6. As, can be seen from Figure 1, each vertical edge 6 is provided with an edge protector 7 which extends from above the electrolyte surface 2, to below the bottom edge 5. Considering Figure 2, each edge protector 7 can be seen to comprise a first elongate element 8 and a second elongate element 9, both of electrically insulating material, e.g. polypropylene.The first element 8 is H shaped to provide a pair of inner jaws 10 defining a. generally parallel sided slot 11 and a pair of outer jaws 12 defining a generally semi circular slot 13. Before insertion into the slot 11, the edges 6 of the matrix plate 1 are provided with a gasket 14 of polyester tape having a thermosetting adhesive to c,ounter any surface irregularities in the edge 6, sthe slot 11 being of such a width that the edge 6 and its gasket 14 may be pressed as an interference fit into the slot 11 and be retained there by friction, and this situation has been attained in Figure 5.The second element 10 is of circular section d as indicated in Figure 5, is positioned over the slot 13 and tapped into its fully engaged position shown in Figure 2 by a rubber mallet 15 or similar tool. The effect of inserting the second element 10 is to force the outer jaws 12 further apart with the result that the inner jaws 10 are levered towards one another thereby exerting greater pressure upon the gasket 14, so that in service, an effective seal is formed by the inner jaws 10, to prevent electrolyte from wetting the edges 6. Although the first element 8 is one piece, the second element can consist of a plurality of individual pieces. Figure 4 details the protrusion of an edge protector 7 below the bottom edge 5, the protrusions serving, e.g. as legs and or for location purposes of the matrix plate 1 within a cell and or to protect the bottom edge 5 when the matrix plate is stood upright after removal from a cell. The protrusions are provided with a piece of nitrile rubber 16 secured between the inner jaws 10, to maintain adhesion of the tape 14 t o the base of the matrix plate 1.
