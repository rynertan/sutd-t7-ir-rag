# Memory array tester.

## Abstract
Apparatus is disclosed for quickly testing memory arrays of multiple recirculating loop memory elements. All loops are loaded simultaneously with identical test bits in the same time required to load a single loop. The loaded data is verified by means of a comparison gate 32 which ANDs the outputs of all elements and produces a data veri fication output signal only in the event that all of the data from each element is identical with that fom all other ele ments on a serial bit by bit basis.
