# Load indicating fastener.

## Abstract
A fastener 20 indicates when a predetermined preload has been applied to the fastener. He includes a body section which is connected with a thread convolution 26 . A load transmitting and indicating section 30 is connected with the body section and includes a bearing section 40 having a flat annular bottom surface 46 and an undulating annular spring section 42 which circumscribes the bearing section 40 . The spring section 42 has a bottom surface 56 with crest 60 and trough portions 62 . The crest portions 60 extend tangentially to the plane of the bottom surface 56 of the bearing section 40 . The trough portions 62 are resiliently deflectable toward the body section to flatten the undulations in the spring section 42 upon application of the predeter mined preload to the fastener 20 . The spring section 42 is resiliently returnable toward an initial configuration to increase the amplitude of the undulations in the spring sec tion 42 to provide a visual indication that the connection between the fastener 20 and a member 70 is loosening.
