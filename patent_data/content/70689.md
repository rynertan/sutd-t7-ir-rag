# Welding process for applying a hardfacing to a nodular iron base metal.

## Abstract
A hardfacing 16 is applied to a nodular iron base metal 15 without preheating or postheating the base metal. Initially a gas tungsten arc welding torch is applied to the base metal at ambient temperature to form a puddle of the base metal. Then a filler metal, e.g. a high chromium iron, is fed into contact with the arc to form a melt of the filler metal on the base metal. The base metal is then allowed to cool to ambient temperature with postheating.

## Description
WEDDING PROCESS POR APPLYING A HARDEACING TO A NODULAR IRON BASE METAL Background of the Inention This invention relates to welding and more particularly to 2 welding process for applying a hardfacing to a nodular iron work piece. Ductile iron, also known as spherodal graphite Iron anc nodular iron, is used in many applications in the construction of heavy duty machinery, gears, rolls and other applications requir ing wear resistance and strength rather than steel because of ductile iron s lower cost. However, in many applications, the wear resistance of ductile iron is still far less than desirable to provide long equipment life. One known way to improve greatly the wear resistant properties of nodular iron is to fuse a hardfacing material to nodular iron parts. The identification of acceptable techniques for welding cast iron has been difficult. Cast irons, which have a much higher carbon content than steel, can form hard eutectic carbides on solidification after fusion welding and, in addition, hard constituents such as martenaite and bainite can be formed in the heat affected zone immediately adjacent the weld. The forration of hard and brittle .bnicrostructural constituents in cast irons can seriously impair machinability and result in cracking, either spontaneously or from service applied loads.One known method for preventing or minimizing the production of hard and brittle structures in the casting is to preheat the casting prior to welding and slowly cool it after welding so that the heataffected zone is able to cool sufficiently slowly, thereby zvoid ins the formation of carbides and maftensite. One specific example of a nodular iron part which has beer successfully hardfaced by this technique is the stalk roll used in a corn header of a combine. A stalk roll is essentially a tubular, cylindrical roll with a plurality of ribs or flutes extending longitudinally of the exterior of the roll. The rolls are use in pairs to gr c a stalk of corn therebetween and pull it vertically downward through a row unit of the corn header, thereby stripping the ear of cora from the stalk in the harvesting operatin.In the harvesting operation, the rolls are fully exposed to the LiXt and sand in the field. The portion of the roil which is subject to the highest abrasive action are th ribs. Thus, by hardfacing the ribs, the life of the roll is greatly enhanced. One known method for the application of a hardfacing to the ribs of a stalk roll is by use of a gas plasma arc welding process.The process includes the stoppe of preheating the nodular iron roll to a red hot temperature a temperature in the range of BoO to 1000 C. The roll is then placed under a plasma arc hardfacing head.A molten puddle of the base metal is produced by the gas plasma. A filler metal of powdered chromium carbide composition in percent by weight 41 Cr, 7z C, 18 Si oB B, and balance Fe is then added to the molten puddle. The roll is allowed to cool without postheating.The time and cost of hardfacing stalk rolls by this method has proved to be a deterrent to the widespread use of stalk rolls with a hardfacing, although the abrasive resistant quality of the rolls so produced is good. Attempts to simplify and reduce the cost of the process by eliminating the preheating step have not proven successful.Without preheating the stalk roll, transverse cracks were produced in the hardfacing and in the base metal which led to spalling of the hardiacing and base metal in the abrasive environment of field use. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a process which overcomes these problems and enables components of high hardness and abrasion resistance to be produced more cheaply without preheating or postheating of the base metal. The method according to the invention is defined in claim 1 below. In the preferred practice, a nodular iron base metal or workpiece is initially disposed at a work station. The temperature of the base metal may be equal to the ambient temperature of the work station that is, the base metal does not have to be preheated to an elevated temperature. A gas tungsten arc welding torch is then applied to the base etal to form a puddle of tne base metal. A filler metal is fec into contact witn the base metal puddle to form a melt of the filler metal. The torch and filler metal are moved in unison over the portion of the base metal to be hardfaced When the torch is moved, the puddle of base metal and the melt of filler metal solidify to forx a hard surface on the base metal.The filler metal is selected from the group consisting of cast iron filler metals having a carbide forming metal as a significant component thereof. The base metal is then allowed to cool without post heating to the ambient temperature of the work station immediately following the completion of the application of the melt of filler metal to the base metal surface. There is no postheating of the base metal or no external heating of the base metal at any time other than by the torch.The elimination of the need for pre heating and post heating has reduced the cost of this welding process relative to other prior art processes and provides a hard facing on a base metal of high hardness and abrasion resistance. Description of the Preferred Embodiments In accordance with the practice of a preferred embodiment of this invention, a nodular iron base metal or workpiece is selected for hardfacing. The specific shape of the workpiece is not critical although the process has its greatest utility in connection with the application of a hardfacing of 2 projection, fluting, etc., of a larger workpiece. The projection rib or fluting may range in thickness width between about .2 cm. and 1.3 cm. The workpiece may be In its 2s cast condition and may, of course, be cleaned, but this has been found not to be necessary. The workpiece is disposed by an operator at a work station maintained at normal room temperatures for human comfort such as between 18 C. to 27 C. and the workpiece assures the ambient temperature 0 the work station. A conventional gas tungsten arc weldIng torch is applied to the workpiece to form a t ddle of the base retail The we ding torch may be o 2 conventional construction suon as a Model XESO E manufactured b Airoc Corp., Union, N. G., and may be opera ted at a voltaqe betwee 12 and 24, at currente between 110 to 230 a ps, and with a w. . Straight polarity power source. The elestrode otrpesition of the aboverentioned terch s of thori amp and a evlindrical shape.The shielding qas mav be helium or mixtures of these cases. Argon gas is preferred. Following the formation of a puddle of the base metal, 2 fIller metal is fed into contact with the puddle to apply 2 melt of the filler metal to a portion of the surface of the base metal to be hardsurfaced. The filler metal and the torch are then moved in unison together over the remaInder o the surface to We covered with a hardfacing. A stringer or weave technique may be used.The hardfacing is applied in thicknesses between a minimum of about .5 mm. to a minimum of 12.7 mm. It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that it is advantageous to obtain the desired properties such as abrasion resistance with as thin a layer of hardfacing as possible to reduce the cost and enhance the toughness provided by the base metal support of the hard surfacing.The feeding rate of the filler metal and travel speed of the torch are adjuated such that the desired hardfacing thickness is obtained at an energy input per unit length of base metal surface area between about 230 J mm and 280 J mm. Also, in order to maximize abrasion resistance and hardness of the workpiece, it is preferred to control the welding param eters such that the percentage dilution defined as 100 times the quotient of the amount of base metal melted divided bv the sum or filler metal added and base metal melted is about 5 to 15 .About 108 is preferred. The filler metal is selected from the group of Iron base alloys, cobalt base alloys, nickel base alloys and carbIde composites. Such filler metals are described in more detail in the Welding Handbook, Volume 2, 7th Edition, pp. 553 and 561 which is incorporated by reference herein. A i filler metal composed of 20 chrom.ium, 5.2E carbon, 1 manganese, .7 silIcon, and 7 molbdenum and the balance iron is exemplary or a Ã§re ferred filler metal. Following the application of the filler metal to the base metal, the workpiece is then allowed to cool without posthesting to the ambient temperature of the work station from a tire immed ately following the application of the hardfacing. The practice of the foregoing process may be performed manually or autemated mechanioelly using conventional techniques as willhe rettonined t these skidded in the art. To further Illustrate the practice of a process in accoroance with the eaus of this inventIon, the following examples have been performed. Example 1 In FIGS. 1 and 2, a wonkpiece 11 to which a hardacic 6 has been applied is shown. Workplace 11 is a stalk roll having utility as described in the Background of the Invention, set forth above.Stalk roll 11 is comprised of a tubular shaft 13 with a plurality of longitudinally extending flutes 15. The roll is made of nodular iron having a composition as follows 3.4 3.8 C, 2.4 2.8 Si, 35 .65 Mg, 2.0 2.5 Cu, .04 .08 Mn, .05 .09 Cr .008 .024 Ph and balance Fe. The workpiece was fixed in position at a work station. The workpiece did not undergo any preheating and was at the a.rient temperature 210C of the work station. A conventional gas tungsten arc welding torch Airco Corp.,Model NB50 B was then applied to one end of one of the flutes.The operating parameters of the torch were welding current 260 280 amps, voltage 14 16 volts, electrode composItIon 2 thoriated tungsten, current carrying capacity 400 amps, shape Cylindrical, and shielding gas argon. An arc was establIshed between the base metal and the torch in a conventional manner by imposing a high frequency, high voltage signal on the welding circuit. The torch was held in its initial pot o for about 1 to S seconds until a puddle of base metal is established. A filler metal composition 20 Cr, 5.2 C, 1 Mn .7 Si, .7 Mo, balance Fe in powder form In steel tube of 1.57 mm. diameter was then fed at the rate of 76 90 cm. per minute into the puddle of base metal as the torch was moved using a weave technique along one of flutes 15 of roll 11. A hadacg 16 of about 4 mm. wde and 2 m. thick was applied olong the entire length of the flute. Each flute 15 of the roll was hardfaceo in the same manner. Ir.ediately following the a of the application of the hard surfacing to the l flute, the roll was i ol to the ar mperature of .e wor. staton w1tnout post neatng. s k roll having the flutes ha A as described above an an icentical nodular ira stai ro .ior has not been a wee 5u2 ecte to a wet G 05 Procedure B specification.The hardness of a flute which had not been hardfaced was 2000 mg p 20 Rc compared to the hardness of 6000 to 7000 mg P 57 53 Ro of a hardaced flute. The hardfaced stalk roll was examined for cracks using a magna flux and black light and was found to have 2 crack propensity per flute of 23. Examples 2 to 7 Additional stalk rolls were hardfaced and evaluated as described in Example 1 except as noted herein. The results are summarized in the following table. Data from Example 1 and an uncoated nodular iron stalk roll are also included in the table for the purpose of comparison.

Test results for crack propensity ranged widely in nur.er however, none of the cracks were Ccund extending into the base material. The surface hardness data suggests that h yh baroness, high carbon and high quantities of carbide forming elements chro.u u. and vanadium contribute to improve wear resistance. Examination of the microstructures indicates that the high carbon, high alloy grades contain the largest amount of Iron alloy carbices. From the foregoing examples, it can be seen that nodular iron can be successfuly hardfaced wIthout the requirement of preheating or postheating to obtain superior wear resistance and a hardness, thereby providing a stalk roll of high quality and yet significantly lower cost compared to prior art techniques for hardfacing While nodular iron is the preferred base metal because of its strength, wear resIstance and reiatlveiv low cost, it will be recognized that the process of this InventIon may also be utilIzed with other iron based alloys as the base metal including high alloy irons, martensitic alloy steels and austenitic steels. It will be recognized that the process of this invention has been described in accordance with a preferred e,wodiment thereof and that other modifications and varIations of the process will be apparent to those skIlled in the art Accordingly, it is Intended that the appended claIms cover all such variatios anc modifications as are within the true spirit and scope of the inventio ..
