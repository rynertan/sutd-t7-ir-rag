# Corrosion monitoring process and apparatus for use therein.

## Abstract
Corrosion of a component surface, e.g. the surface of a pipe, is monitored by monitoring the thickness, e.g. by resis tance measurement, of a test element formed from the mater ial of the component and mounted so that its exposed surface is flush with and extends over substantially all of one dimen sion of the component surface, e.g. substantially all round the circumference of a pipe.
