# Variflux vibration transducer.

## Abstract
A vibration transducer 10,50 is disclosed which comprises a hollow casing, and spring means, coil means, a non magnetic conductor, and a permanent magnet, all positioned inside the casing. The coil means 20 and the magnet are stationary relative to the casing 12,52 , and the spring means 34 34 min , 66 elastically support the non magnetic electric conductor 32,60 for axial movements relative to the magnet 16,56 , whereby eddy currents become induced in the conductor which generate electric signals in the coil means in response to relative movements between the conductor and the magnet, the signals being proportional to a parameter of the axial movements. The parameter is acceleration and the transducer has a frequency response which provides a continuously increasing sensitivity for increasing frequency of seismic energy imparted into the earth, thereby substantially overcoming the normal earth s attenuation of higher frequencies.
