# Fire retardant polyamide composition.

## Abstract
Polyamide compositions, flame retarded using a halogenated organic flame retardant, are blended with a polymer blend resin which is at least partially incompatible with and has a lower melt viscosity than the polyamide, to improve the arc tracking resistance of the polyamide com position. The polyamide compositions are particularly useful in the manufacture of flame retarded electrical components.
