# Process for magnetically transferring a powder image.

## Abstract
Process for transferring a powder image which has been formed with permanently magnetizable developing powder, which process comprises the steps of magnetically transferring the powder image 2 to an intermediate receiving member 4 having a uniform magnetic permeability over its whole surface and comprising magnetizable material having no remanent magnetism and subsequently transferring the powder image from the intermediate receiving material 9 . The transfer of the powder image 2 to the intermediate receiving member 4 is effected by mag netizing the powder image 2 and contacting it with the intermediate receiving member 4 . In a specific embodiment of the invention, the powder image 2 is magnetized while it is in contact with the surface of the intermediate receiving member 4 . The intermediate receiving member 4 preferably has a relative magnetic permeability of at least 2.
