# ELECTROFILTER USING AN IMPROVED ELECTRODE ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A system and method for dewatering or separating particles from a liquid or a colloidal suspension comprises the use of an electrofilter with separated, submerged electrodes 40, 50 the electrode 40 used for collecting the solid particles comprises an assembly 42 of an ion selective membrane shell 48 , coated with or having bonded on its interior, a conductive metal composite catalyst layer 56, and a conductive structural material core 58 such as graphite within the shell. The electrode assembly does not require the use of an electrolytic solution within the shell, but may be operated with one. A direct current is applied to the electrofilter so that the particles in the suspension will migrate towards the electrode assembly 42 and form a caked deposit or slurry layer on the outside of the mem brane. In one embodiment, the electrode assembly can be removed from the electrofilter cell so that the dewatered or separated solids may be removed from the outside surfaces of the membrane.
