# Mechanical tube plug removal tool.

## Abstract
A tool and its method of operation for removing hollow plugs 14 which have been mechanically expanded into tubes 12 . The tool includes an electrical welding electrode 54 having a tungsten tip 56 . The electrode is positioned within the plug and rotatably withdrawn therefrom while energized, so that an electrical arc is struck between the electrode tip 56 and the inner wall of the plug 14 , thereby melting the metal on the inner surface of the plug along a spiral path. This causes the plug to heat shrink back to its approximate size prior to when it was expanded into tight engagement in the tube end. The plug can thereafter be easily removed from the tube by means of a simple gripping tool.
