# Downhole well tool.

## Abstract
A downhole tool includes a pipe string portion which is disposed in a pipe string of a well and a probe portion which can be lowered by wireline or other suitable means into the well for engagement with the pipe string portion. The pipe string portion includes a sliding sleeve valve 8 which is biased in a closed, or unactuated position as drawn , by a spring 10 contained within the pipe string portion. The probe portion includes a connector mechanism 84 which engages lugs 78 of the pipe string portion for imparting an opposing force to the sliding sleeve valve which overcomes the biasing force of the spring, so that the valve can be opened ports 100,56 and 36 in alignment to permit reservoir pressure to enter a cavity of the probe portion containing a sensor mechanism. The coupling and decoupling of the connector mechanism with the lugs is effected through downward and upward movements of the probe portion. The probe portion also includes a jarring mechanism 146, 148 for applying either an upward or a downward force impulse to the probe portion to facilitate its movement should it become stuck, for example.
