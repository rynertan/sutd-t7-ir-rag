# Production of aromatic polyketones.

## Abstract
Production of an aromatic polyketone by reacting in the presence of a fluoroalkane sulphonic acid the reac tants selected from a a mixture of i at least one aromatic diacyl halide WOC Ar COW where Ar is a divalent aromatic radical, W is halogen and COW is an aromatically bound acyl halide group, which diacyl halide is polymerisable with the at least one aromatic com pound of ii , and ii at least one aromatic compound H Ar H where Ar is a divalent aromatic radical and H is an aromatically bound hydrogen atom, which com pound is polymerisable with the at least one diacyl halide of i b at least one aromatic monoacyl halide H Ar COW where Ar is a divalent aromatic radical and H, W, and COW are as defined in a , which mono acyl halide is self polymerisable and c a combination of a and b .
