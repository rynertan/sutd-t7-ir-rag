# Optical position sensor.

## Abstract
An optical position sensor comprises a linear element or a disc 22 carrying stripes or rings coded with reflecting and non reflecting areas. Light pulses of short duration from a source 12 are transmitted through a transmission line 15 coupled to optical fibres 20a to 20e of differing lengths, whose ends 21a to 21e are opposite the coded channels. When a reflecting area is opposite the fibre end, light is reflected back along the fibre and transmission line and returned to a light detector 25a as a sequence of pulses. These pulses are applied to a shift register 26 from which they may be read in parallel form into a processor 31 . A clock system 24 controls the light source and provides clocking pulses for the shift register, and, by means of a counter 29 , a periodical pulse for resetting the shift register between the coded pulse sequences. A variable delay 27 permits the pulse sequences received at the shift register to be synchron ised with the clock. In a modification, the fibres may be coupled at sequential points along the transmission lines, and the transmission line may have a Y coupler to one arm of which the light source is coupled while the other serves for coupling the detector.
