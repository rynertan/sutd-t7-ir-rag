# Data processing arrangements.

## Abstract
A data processing arrangement is operative to combine data representing different kinds of information from disparate sources. The data is stored under assigned addresses having a mutually compatible co ordinate format, and is processed us ing those addresses. Relevant portions of data from a very large amount of information can be readily extracted in this way, and combined with other data which is related by virtue of a common address. The arrangement is applicable to flight management of an aircraft.
