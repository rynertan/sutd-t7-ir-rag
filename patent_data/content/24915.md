# Two component industrial maintenance resin coating systems and compositions and coating processes using them.

## Abstract
The present invention is directed to a two component industrial maintenance coating system. The first component comprises a polyamine terminated epoxy resin which is end capped with specifically defined monoepoxides. A co solvent is optionally employed in the first component where the end capped adduct is a solid at room temperature. The second component comprises a low molecular weight polyepoxide resin crosslinker and optionally a diluent when the epoxy crosslinker is very viscous or solid at room temperature. Before the two components are mixed together the end cap ped adduct is converted to its water soluble or water dispers able salt form by reaction with a volatile acid to achieve a certain degree of salting. When the two components are mixed together the epoxide resin crosslinker is microemul sified. The composition which results upon mixing the com ponents is curable at room temperature and exhibits an excel lent balance of chemical and physical properties.
