## Description
NOVEL ADENINE NUCLEOSIDE DERIVATIVES, THEIR PREPARATIONAND PHARMACEUTICAL .C.OMPO.S.I. LON.S. CONTAINING THEM. Thais invention relates to novel adenine nucleoside deriva tisves, to their preparation and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them. More particularly, this invention relates to novel esters of vidarabine and its carbocyclic analog cyclaradine,these esters having been found to possess useful therapeutic activity in particular useful antiviral activity. Known in the art is the adenine nucleoside 9 ss D arabino furanosyl adenine also termed vidarabine or ara A. Vidarabine is known to exhibit antiviral activity. Also known in the art is the carbocyclic analog of vidarabine, this analog and its preparation being disclosed in United StatesPatent 4,138,562 and J.Med.Chem.,20,612 1977 . This carbocyclic analog 9 2 alpha ,5ss dihydroxy 4 alpha hydroxymethyl cyclopent la yl adenine is also known as cyclaradine orC ara A. Cyclaradine has been shown to exhibit in vitro antiviral activity.We have now found that a specified group of derivatives of the aforementioned adenine nucleosides exhibits, inter alia, particularly useful in vivo antiviral activity.Accordingly, in one of its aspects the present invention provides novel adenine nucleoside derivatives of the general formula IEMI2.1 and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, whereinQ represents oxygen or methylene and R, R and R indepen y dently represent hydrogen or an alkoxyalkanoyl grouping R1 O R2 CO , with the proviso that at least one of Rxa Ry and Rz is the alkoxyalkanoyl grouping Rl O R2 CO , the alkyl moiety R1 and the alkadiyl moiety R2 each independently containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms.The group R1 may be methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl or hexyl, including the corresponding branched chain isomers thereof while the group R2 may be the corresponding alkadiyl analog of the aforementioned alkyl groups. Preferably Rx is Rl O R2 CO and Ry and Rz are hydrogen.For R1 and R2 preferred values are methyl and methylene respectively.The pharmaceutically acceptable salts are those salts of the compounds of the general formula I derived from an appropriate organic or inorganic acid3 such as a mineral acid. As typical salts there may be mentioned the hydrochloride and sulfate salts.The compounds of the general formula I may exist in the form of optical isomers and these isomers as well as the racemic mixtures are included within the compounds of this invention.Preferred compounds of the general formula I are the monoester derivatives, that is derivatives where Rx represents R1 O R2 CO and R and Rz represent hydrogen. y Specifically preferred compounds are the 5 methoxyacetyl ester of vidarabine and the 5 methoxyacetyl ester of its carbocyclic analog cyclaradine alternatively named herein as 4 methoxyacetoxymethyl cyclaradine. Other typical compounds are 9 ss D arabinofuranosyladenine 5 7 hexyloxyheptanOate 9 ss D arabinofuranosyladenine 5 4 propyloxybutyrate 9 ss D arabinofuranosyladenine 5 4 ethoxybutyrate and 9 ss D arabinofuranosyladenine 3 ,5 di 0 5 ethOxyvalerate as well as the corresponding cyclaradine esters.The adenine nucleoside derivatives of the general formula I may be prepared by standard esterification techniques.Thus vidarabine or cyclaradine or a reactive derivative thereof may be reacted with the appropriate alkoxyalkanoic acid or a reactive derivative thereof, a so obtained diester, or triester,if desired, selectively hydrolysed and then the required ester isolated in free form or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.Preparation Of the required ester derivative of the general formula I may thus entail selectively esterifying the desired hydroxy group or a reactive derivative thereof of the vidarabine or cy claradine starting material or alternatively esterifying two or more of the hydroxy groups followed by selectively hydrolys ing one or where appropriate, two of the so esterified hydroxy groups.The precise manner of esterification in any particular instance will depend upon well known factors such as the reactivity of the hydroxy group in question, nature of the esterifying agent, esterification conditions as well as whether a selective hydrolysis step is to be included. As stated, in the process for preparing the compounds of the general formula I, vidarabine or cyclaradine or a reactive derivative thereof is used as starting material. The reactive derivative may be a monoester or diester derivative of vidarabine or cyclaradine falling within the general formula I, the free hydroxy group or groups constituting the reactive moiety of the vidarabine or cyclaradine derivative. The reactive derivative may also be a vidarabine or cyclaradine deri votive having one or more esterified hydroxy groups capableQf being replaced in a trans esterification or like reaction by the desired ester group.As a further possibility can be mentioned the case where the reactive derivative is a haloderivative of the parent alcohol, the desired reaction in this case being effected by reaction of that halo derivative with an alkalis metal salt of the appropriate alkoxyalkanoic acid. Esterificaton of the specified started material may, as stated, be effected with the appropriate alkoxyalkanoic acid or a reactive derivative thereof. In this connection, any convenient derivative may be employed, the nature of such derivative being well known to the person skilled in the art. For instance as one commonly used derivative, there may be mentioned the halide derivative of the acid in question, esterification then being effected by reacting that halide derivative with the hydroxy group of the vidarabine or cyclaradine starting material.As will be parent from the above description, any appropriate method for introducing the required ester function may be employed in preparing the compounds of the present invention.By way of specific illustration, the compounds of the general formula I where Rx is tn alkoxyalkanoyl group and Ry and Hz are hydrogen may typically be prepared by adding the appropriatemolarciuantity of the required alkoxyalkanoyl halide to a solution of the parent vidarabine or cyclaradine in a non reactive, non aqueous solvent preferably watermiscible such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, tetrahydrofuran or pyridine. The stirred reaction mixture is then maintained at reduced temperature, say 40C, for 18 24 hours. The reaction is then quenched by adding water or aqueous sodium bicarbonate to the reaction mixture, following which the resulting desired ester is isolated in conventional manner and purified. By using appropriate amounts of the alkoxyalkanoic acid halide one, two or three molar equivalents of the required alkoxyalkanoate moiety may be introduced into the vidarahine or cyclaradine molecule giving the monoester, diester or triester. In those instances where the immediate product is a mixture of esters, such as a mixture of a monoester and diester, separation of the required ester from the product mixture may be effected in known manner, for instance using chromatographic techniques.Where mixed esters are required, that is a di or tri ester derived from more than one acid, a mono or diester starting material may be reacted with a halide derived from a different acid to that employed in preparing the mono or diester starting material. Further, where it is required to esterify a relatively less reactive hydroxy group, such as a secondary hydroxy group, in the presence of another hydroxy group which is relatively more reactive, such as the primary hydroxy group, that more reactive hydroxy group can be protected in known manner during the esterification and the protecting group subsequently removed.The preparation of the compounds of the general formula I will now be illustrated by way of the following Examples Example 1 9 ss D Arabinofuranosyladenine 5 methoxyacetate Arabinofuranosyladenine 4.8 g, 18 mmoles was dissolved im dry dimethylformamide 150 ml by warming and the solution was then cooled to OOC.

As previously stated3 the compounds of the general formula I have been found to exhibit, inter alia, particularly useful in vivo antiviral activity. Accordingly, the compounds of the general formula I are indicated as being useful in the treatment of infections, particularly those of mammals, caused byDNA containing viruses such as herpes viruses, including types 1 and 2 and herpes zoster as well as in the treatment of infections caused by adenoviruses, papovaviruses causing warts , picodnaviruses and poxviruses.The in vivo antiviral activity of the compounds of the general formula I may be illustrated by way of data obtained with the following two compounds Compound A Vidarabine 5 methoxyacetate Prepared in Example 1 Compound B Cyclaradine 5 methoxyacetate Prepared in Example 4 . The antiviral efficacy of these compounds in the treatment of genital infections in female guinea pigs was determined, the infecting virus being herpes simplex virus type 2. The in vivo efficacy was measured in terms of the effect of these compounds ih suppressing lesion development induced by the infecting virus. The incidence of lesions for virusinfected animals treated with the test compound was measured and compared with the results obtained for virus infected control animals treated with placebo, or with the results obtained for untreated virus infected animals. In the control groups of animals small lesions usually appeared 3 to 4 days following infection, the virus induced lesions reaching a maximum severity around 7 days postinfection this peak being followed by scab formation and then healing.In each case the test animals were infected by intravaginal inoculation with the herpes simple virus type 2 in 0.1 ml of cell culture medium.0.1 ml. of a 0,8 agarose gel containing the test compound at the stated concentration was then administered intra vaginally, treatment commencing unless otherwise stated 3 hours postinfection and the test compound being administered 3 times daily for 7 days. The incidence of lesions was observed at regular intervals and noted. The results obtained for Compound A are given in Table 1 and for Compound B in Table 2. Table 1 Ih vivo antiviral efficacy Compound A Test group of animals Percentage of animals with lesions le s Is a t day 7 i Control group untreated 83 ii Control group plac ebo treated 95 iii Test group treated with Compound A at a concentra tion of 5 20 10 30 15 0 Table 1 shows that compound A at a concentration of 15 comple tely suppressed les ion formation. In a separate comparative experiment, vidarabine itself was employed in the above test procedure and compared with untreated and placebo treated control groups of animals. The vida rabine composition was in the form of a 5 vidarabine formu lation in o.8p agarose gel. At day 4 postinfection, 50 of the animals treated with vidarabine had lesions and at day 7 postinfection, 80 had lesions. For the control groups at day 7, the untreated control group showed 85 of the animals with lesions and the placebo treated control group showed 90 with lesions. Table 2 Tn vivo antiviral effic acy Compound B . Test group of animals Percentage of animals with lesions at lesins at day 5 i Control group untreated 60 ii Control group placebo treated 90 iii Test group treated with Compound B at a concentration of 5 33 10 33 For the results given in Table 2, drug administration was commenced 6 hours postinfection and the test compound admini stered three times daily for 5 days. As cAn he seen from Table 2, 60 90 of the herpes simplex type 2 infected control animals developed virus induced lesions compared with 33 of the Compound B treated ani finals. In a separate comparative experiment, cyclaradine was employed in the above test procedure. At concentrations of 3 and 10 , the group treated with cyclaradine showed 100 of the test animalshad lesions at day 7 postinfection as had an untreated control group and a placebo treated control group. FrQm the above in vivo results, it will be seen that the esters of the general formula I were surprisingly more active than the parent alcohols vidarabine and cyclaradine. Xh addition to the above indcated particularly useful in vivo antiviral activity, the compounds of the general formula T where Q is .CH2 have the further advantage of being resistant to degradation by the enzyme adenosine deaminase a normal constituent of human serum .Further, the compounds of the general formula I are indicated as being more water soluble than the parent vidarabine and cyclaradine compounds and this higher solubility has the added advantage of facilitating formulation of the active compounds in creams or other aqueous formulations. Thus3 at 37 0C. in water, cyclaradine has a solubility of 1 mg ml while cyclaradine 5 methoxyacetate has a solubility of 75 mg ml.Regarding toxlcity, the compounds of the invention are indicated as being no more toxic than the parent compounds vida rabine literature LD50 11,700 mg kg i.p. and cyclaradine.Thus in comparative testing in random bred Swiss mice treated i.p., cyclaradine was not lethal at a dose of 900 mg kg while for cyclaradine 51 methoxyacetate no signs of toxicity at all were noted at the highest dose tested of 750 mg kg.The alkoxyalkanoate esters of the formula I can be formulated in standard fashion with conventional pharmaceutical exci bents. Accordingly, in another of its aspects, the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising as active ingredient a compound of the general formula I together with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier. Illustrative of such compositions are topical formulations where an amount of from about 1 to 20 by weight of the ester may be used. For application to the skin the concentration is desirably in the range of from about 5 to 20 by weight in the case of vidarabine esters of the general formula I, preferably 10 to 15 . In the case of cyclaradine esters of the general formula I, an amount of 1 5 by weight of the ester may be used with a preferred value being about 2.5 .In any particular instance the appropriate amount of active ingredient may be ascertained. For the formulation bases, standard dermatological cream and ointment bases can be employed in the usual manner. For treatment of susceptible viral infections of the eye or genital areas, standard standard ophthalmic and vaginal bases, respectively, such as creams or solutions can be employed.In a typical regimen, topically acceptable formulations are applied four times daily to the affected site for a period of five to fourteen days until the infection clears.These compositions can be applied to the infected site in the usual manner. Semi solid dosage forms can be spread manually or with an applicator, and liquid forms can be applied by dropper or spray.The compounds of the general formula I may also be administered parenterally, in parenterally acceptable vehicles, in the treatment of herpes virus, encephalitis, shingles, disseminated varicella, cytomegalovirus infection, and the like.Typical pharmaceutical compositions containing a compound of the general formula I as active ingredient are illustrated by way of the following one gram topical formulation examples containing 15 of active ingredient, the preparation of the formulation employing standard techniques.
