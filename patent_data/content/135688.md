# PROCESS FOR MAKING AN ELECTROLUMINESCENT LAMP

## Abstract
A process for making thin flexible electroluminescent lamps comprises continuously feeding a flexible strip of transparent insulating material which serves as the carrier for performing various process steps, as well as becoming part of the finished lamp itself. The strip is provided with a thin transparent conductive layer. An epoxy phosphor mix ture is continuously applied to a controlled thickness over the conductive layer and cured in an oven. Another conduc tive layer is continuously applied over the cured epoxy phosphor layer on the carrier sheet and dried. In a preferred embodiment, lamp members are severed from the roll, and a narrow groove is made in the last applied conductive layer to divide the conductive layer into two exposed electrode areas to which the lamp terminals are connected. In another embodiment, the conductive layer on the plastic carrier sheet is continuously subdivided by vaporizing the conduc tive material to form a narrow groove with an electric arc. In this latter case, the conductive layers on the edges of the plastic carrier sheet serve as the two exposed electrode areas and receive terminals connected at the edges.
