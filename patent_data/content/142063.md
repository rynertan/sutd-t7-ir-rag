# Lighting apparatus for an electric discharge lamp.

## Abstract
A lighting apparatus for an electric discharge lamp is disclosed. This apparatus comprises a lighting ballast capacitor 41 , connected in series to an electric discharge lamp 30 , for stabilizing a lighting current to the lamp 30 a preheating ballast capacitor 42 , connected in parallel to the lamp 30 , for supplying a preheating electric power to the lamp electric power supply means 4, 43, 130 including an output transformer 11 for supplying an electric power to the lighting ballast capacitor 41 a control electric power supply circuit 90 for obtaining a control electric power through the lighting ballast capacitor 41 and discharge lamp 30 or the preheating ballast capacitor 42 without adding a stepdown transformer or a resistive element for voltage drop and an oscillator 10, 110 which receives the control electric power from the control power supply circuit and controls the electric power supply means. With this lighting apparatus, the electric power loss is made small and the miniaturization of the apparatus can be realized.
