# Machine tool.

## Abstract
A machine tool has a table 14 movable relative to a head 10 for machining a workpiece 16 mounted on the head 10 by a tool 19A mounted on the table 14 . The table 14 also supports a magazine 17 for blank workpieces 16A , and the table 14 is movable between a first position in which the head 10 and the tool 19A are in machining proximity and a second position in which the head 10 and the magazine 17 are proximate. The head 10 has a work holder 15 adapted to grip a blank workpiece 16A at said second position for transfer, by movement of the table 14 , to said first position. After machining, the workpiece 16 is correspondingly return able to the magazine 17 . The work holder 15 is mounted on a spindle 12 supported on the head 10 and rotatable for machining purposes. In a modification the spindle 12 sup ports a tool 23 , and the head 10 has a gripper 31 which is separate from the spindle 12 and is used for the transfer of workpieces 16 between the magazine 17 and a work holder 20 mounted on the table 14 .
