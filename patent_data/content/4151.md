# Antistatic films.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an antistatic film having a polypropylene substrate and a polymeric heat sealable surface layer on which is present an antistatic composition comprising a a quaternary ammonium compound, such as choline chloride, b an organic polyol containing at least two free hydroxyl groups, such as glycerol, c a glyceride of a long chain fatty acid, such as glyceryl monostearate, and, optionally, d an ethoxylated amine salt, such as an ethoxylated tallow amine sulphate. The composition is conveniently applied directly to the surface of a polymeric extrudate which is subsequently drawn to yield an oriented film, but at least the glyceride may be preblended into the film forming polymer. The invention facilitates the production of uniformly antistatic packaging films despite variations in ambient relative humidity.
