# Horizontal continuous casting installation.

## Abstract
A horizontal continuous casting installation, particular ly for casting a strand of a large transverse dimension, wherein a body of molten metal 12 stored in a tundish is continuously supplied through a tundish nozzle secured to the tundish in the vicinity of its bottom and extending ho rizontally therefrom to a mold 3 connected to the forward end of the tundish nozzle 15 and arranged coaxially there with to cast a strand which is continuously withdrawn ho rizontally from the mold. The mold has an inner transverse dimension greater than the inner transverse dimension of the tundish nozzle. An electromagnetic field generating device 23 is located between an outer surface of the tun dish nozzle and an inner surface 19 of the mold 3 in the vicinity of an end surface of the mold facing the tundish nozzle for exerting an electromagnetic force on the body of molten metal flowing from the tundish nozzle to the mold in such a manner that the electromagnetic force is oriented toward the center of the body of molten metal.
