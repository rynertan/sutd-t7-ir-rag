# Production of immune interferon and its mRNA.

## Abstract
Process for the production of IFN gamma comprising incubating for a period of time at least sufficient for the production of IFN gamma , a viable cell suspension which includes a leukocytes, b an inducer for production of IFN gamma , and c a modulator for said inducer selected from the group consisting of mezerein and 12, 13 phorbol butyrate, said inducer and said modulator being present in said suspension in amounts sufficient to stimulate production of IFN gamma process for producing homogeneous IFN gamma process for producing IFN gamma mRNA and cloning process for production of IFN . Products disclosed are homogeneous IFN gamma and its 2 species and the host cells containing the recombinant cloning vehicle containing DNA segment coding for IFN gamma .
