# Vibration resistant fastener for soft joint surfaces.

## Abstract
A self locking fastener having a bearing surface compris ing a plurality of serrations arranged to penetrate a work piece such that while a resistance to the loosening of the fastener from the workpiece is created the marring of the workpiece surface is minimized. Use of the fastener is particularly advantageous if the workpiece consists of soft materials such as cast aluminum or non heat treated carbon steels. Each serration, when viewed as a profile, includes a downwardly inclined surface 17 , a relatively deeper serra tion 16 and a relatively shallower intermediate serration 18 . The intermediate serration controls the depth of the penetration into a workpiece.
