# Method for controlling the amount of fuel supply for an engine.

## Abstract
Fuel control method is disclosed, in which data used to control the amount of fuel supply in the previous cycle is cor rected by an output of an Oâ‚‚ sensor 21 in a current cycle and added to or subtracted from the corrected data value is a dif ference between a value derived from data stored in a map based on an output of a vacuum sensor 19 and an engine ro tation speed in the previous cycle and a value derived from the data stored in the map based on an output of the vacuum sen sor and an engine rotation speed in the current cycle, and the sum or difference is used as current control data.
