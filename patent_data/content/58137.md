## Abstract
Apparatus for providing X rays 11 to an object 12 in air. A lens 13 directs energy 14 from a laser 27 onto a target 15 to produce X rays 11 of a selected spectrum and intensity. A substantially fluid tight first enclosure 16 around the target 15 has a pressure therein substantially below atmospheric pressure, and has at least a portion of one wall 19 in common with an adjoining substantially fluid tight second enclosure 18 containing only helium or hydrogen. The common wall portion 19 has an opening 20 large enough to permit X rays 11 to pass through and yet small enough that gas 21 can be evacuated from the first enclosure 16 at least as fast as it enters through the opening 20 . The target 15 is located close to the opening 20 and a emits a substantial portion of the X rays 11 through the opening 20 and on toward a wall 22 of the second enclosure 18 having a portion 25 that is highly transparent to them, so that the object 12 to which the X rays 11 are to be provided may be located outside the second enclosure 18 and adjacent thereto and thus receive the X rays 11 substantially unimpeded by air or other undesired intervening matter.

## Description
PROVIDING X RAYSFIELD This invention relates to apparatus for providingX rays to an object that may be in an ordinary environment such as air at approximately atmospheric pressure. Apparatus according to the present invention is especially useful for applications wherein it is expensive, time consuming, or otherwise inconvenient to move objects that are to receive soft X rays into and out of a special environment, such as a vacuum chamber in which the X rays are produced. Typical applications of this type include laser produced X ray systems for high resolution lithography, for extended X ray absorption fine structure EXAFS spectroscopy, and for X ray microscopy.BACKGROUND X rays usually are produced in a vacuum, but for many purposes it is desirable to apply them in air.For soft X rays1 especially those having photon energies of less than about 5 keV, a problem arises in bringing the X rays from the vacuum into air, because a window that is thick enough and strong enough to withstand the pressure difference between the vacuum and the air is opaque to the X rays, except in very small windows. The problem is especially serious in X ray lithography, where it is desirable to illuminate large areas. The present invention provides simple, inexpensive, convenient means for overcoming the problem. It is shown in United State Patent 4,058,486,November 15, 1977, of P.J. Mallozzi, H.M. Epstein, R.G.Jung, D.C. Applebaum, B.P. Fairand, and W.J. Gallagher, for Producing X rays, that an intense point source ofX rays can be generated by focusing a laser beam onto a solid target. Neodymium laser light focused onto a solid slab target has been converted into X rays with an efficiency greater than 25 percent, with several tens of joules of X rays emanating from an essentially point source about 100 microns diameter in a nanosecond.The X ray pattern produced with iron targets irradiated with about 100 joule laser pulses at a 45 degree angle of incidence is substantially omnidirectional. The conversion efficiency of greater than 25 percent refers toX rays which are radiated away from the slab and pass perpendicularly through 3000 Angstroms of plastic paraline coated with 2000 Angstroms of aluminum. This conversion efficiency is thus a lower bound and refers only to the portion of the spectrum above about 300 electron volts. Most of the observed X rays lie between about 0.3 and 1.5 keV, with a small but useful fraction having energies as high as 10 to 100 keV. In a densitometer tracing of a bent crystal spectrograph taken with a RAP crystal, the radiation appears to be mostly lines in the spectral interval of about 0.7 to 1.2 keV.The unusual sharpness of the spectral detail is due to the tiny dimensions of the source. This novel point source of X rays provides a spectrum tuneable throughout a range of about 0.1 to 100 keV. Apparatus according to the present invention typically employs X ray producing means of the type described above. It may, however, use other somewhat similar means, such as equipment that uses an electron beam, rather than a laser beam, for producing the X rays.DISCLOSURE Typical apparatus according to the present invention for providing X rays to an object that may be in an ordinary environment such as air at approximately atmospheric pressure comprises means for directing energy onto a target to produce X rays of a selected spectrum and intensity at the target, a substantially fluid tight first enclosure around the target, means for reducing the quantity of gas in the first enclosure to maintain the pressure therein substantially below atmospheric pressure, a substantially fluid tight second enclosure adjoining the first enclosure, with the two enclosures having at least a portion of one wall in common, the common wall portion having therein an opening large enough to permit X rays to pass through it and yet small enough that the pressure reducing means can evacuate gas from the first enclosure at least as fast as it enters through the opening, the target being located close enough to the opening and so positioned as to emit a substantial portion of the X rays produced toward the opening, to pass through it and on toward a wall of the second enclosure located opposite the opening, means for conveying into the second enclosure a gas that is highly transparent to X rays, to the substantial exclusion of other gases, and the wall of the second enclosure to which the X rays travel having a portion that is highly transparent to them, so that the object to which theX rays are to be provided may be located outside the second enclosure and adjacent thereto and thus receive the X rays substantially unimpeded by air or other undesired intervening matter. The energy directing means comprises means for directing energy from a laser onto the target, as by focusing the energy onto a spot on the target having a diameter of about 1 to 200 micrometers. Typically the opening in the common wall portion is about 0.2 to 2 millimeters in diameter, and the distance between the opening and the spot on the target is about 0.2 to 5 centimeters. Typically the gas conveyed into the second enclosure is helium, hydrogen, or a hydrocarbon preferably helium maintained, at least in the vicinity of the highly transparent portion of the wall thereof, at a pressure of about 0.9 to 1 atmosphere. Typically the highly transparent portion of the wall af the second enclosure comprises a thin foil that typically comprises essentially beryllium or a plastic material. The thickness of the foil typically is about 2 to 20 micrometers. The X rays produced at the target typically have energies predominantly of about 0.3 to 2 keV. Where the gas in the second enclosure, at least in the vicinity of the highly transparent portion of the wall thereof, is maintained at approximately the pressure of the ambient air, the highly transparent portion of the wall of the second enclosure may comprise an opening therein and the gas inside the second enclosure can be substantially separated from the air around it either by a gas curtain passing along the opening or by the object to which the X rays are to be provided, or a component associated with the object, placed against the wall and covering the opening. The second enclosure may have an intermediate compartment between the common wall portion and the wall having the highly transparent portion the gas in the intermediate compartment being maintained at a pressure less than the pressure in the vicinity of the highly transparent portion of the wall of the second enclosure and greater than the pressure in the first enclosure. Apparatus according to the invention for obtainingEXAFS data of a material, typically comprises also spectral dispersive means in the second enclosure so located as to receive X rays that pass through the opening and to direct the spectrally resolved X rays on toward the highly transparent portion of the wall adjacent to the object to which the X rays are to be provided, and the object typically comprises recording means. Such apparatus typically comprises also means for positioning a sample of material in the optical path of the X rays, either in the second enclosure or outside of the second enclosure and between the highly transparent portion of the wall and the recording means. DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a schematic plan view of typical apparatus according to the present invention. Figure 2 is a similar view of a typical embodiment of the invention for obtaining EXAFS data of a material.CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Referring to the drawings, and now especially toFigure 1, typical apparatus according to the present invention for providing X rays 11 to an object 12 that may be in an ordinary environment such as air at approximately atmospheric pressure comprises means such as a lens 13 for directing energy 14 onto a target 15 to produce X rays 11 of a selected spectrum and intensity at the target 15, a substantially fluid tight first enclosure 16 around the target 15, means as indicated by the arrow 17 such as a vacuum pump, not shown for reducing the quantity of gas in the first enclosure 16 to maintain the pressure therein subs can tially below atmospheric pressure typically less than about 1 torr , a substantially fluid tight second enclosure 18 adjoining the first enclosure 16, with the two enclosures 16,18 having at least a portion of one wall 19 in common, the common wall portion 19 having therein an opening 20 large enough to permit X rays 11 to pass through it 20 and yet small enough that the pressure reducing means can evacuate gas 21 from the first enclosure 16 at least as fast as it enters through the opening 20, the target 15 being located close enough to the opening 20 and so positioned as to emit a substantial portion of the X rays 11 produced toward the opening 20, to pass through it 20 and on toward a wall 22 of the second enclosure 18 located opposite the opening 20, means as indicated by the arrow 23 such as a pump, not shown for conveying into the second enclosure 18 a gas 24 that is highly transparent to X rays 11, to the substantial exclusion of other gases, and the wall 22 of the second enclosure 18 to which the X rays 11 travel having a portion 25 that is highly transparent to them 11 , so that the object 12 to which the X rays 11 are to be provided may be located outside the second enclosure 18 and adjacent thereto and thus receive theX rays 11 substantially unimpeded by air or other undesired intervening matter. Where only specific regions of the object 12 are to receive the X rays 11, as in X ray lithography, a mask 26 may be placed between the highly transparent portion 25 of the wall 22 and the object 12 to block,the X rays proceeding toward the other regions of the object 12. The energy directing means typically comprises a lens 13 for directing energy 14, passing through a windy 29 in the first enclosure 16, from a laser 27, onto the target 15, as by focusing the energy 14 onto a spot 28 on the target 15 having a diameter of about 1 to 200 micrometers. Typically the opening 20 in the common wall portion 19 is about 0.2 to 2 millimeters in diameter, and the distance between the opening 20 and the spot 28 on the target 15 is about 0.2 to 5 centimeters. Typically the gas 24 conveyed into the second enclosure 18 is helium, hydrogen, or a hydrocarbon, such as methane maintained at a pressure of about 0.9 to 1 atmosphere, at least in the vicinity of the highly transparent portion of the wall thereof. Preferably the gas 24 comprises essentially helium, which is known to be highly transparent to X rays as well as substantially inert. Typically the highly transparent portion 25 of the wall 22 of the second enclosure 18 comprises a thin foil 25 that typically comprises essentially beryllium or a plastic material. The thickness of the foil 25 typically is about 2 to 20 micrometers. Other materials, preferably having atomic numbers of not more than about 8, may also be used. Where a less transparent material is used it must be very thin. The X rays 11 produced at the target 15 typically have energies predominantly of about 0.3 to 2 keV. Where the pressure of the gas 24 in the second enclosure 18 is maintained at approximately atmospheric pressure, the highly transparent portion 25 of the wall 22 may be very thin, because the pressure on each side of it is approximately the same. It may even comprise only a gas curtain, rather than a solid material or the mask 26 in Figure 1 or the sample 32 in Figure 2 may be placed against the thick frame formed by the wall 22 to substantially separate the gas 24 inside the second enclosure 18 from the air around it. Where an adjacent mask or sample is not used, the object 12 may be placed against the wall 22 to substantially separate the gas 24 inside the second enclosure 18 from the air around it. In some embodiments of the invention it may be desirable to form at least one intermediate compartment 34 in the second enclosure 18, as shown in Figure 1 between the wall 19 having an opening 20 therein for the X rays 11 to pass through and the wall 19. The pressure in each such compartment is maintained between the pressures in the adjacent enclosed regions. As indicated by the arrow 17 , means such as a vacuum pump not shown can maintain the proper pressure. Where more than one intermediate compartment 34 is provided in the second enclosure 18, a differential evacuation system of the type used for the emission of electron beams into the atmosphere may be desirable. Where the gas 24 in the second enclosure 18, at least in the vicinity of the highly transparent portion 25 of the wall 22 thereof, is maintained at approximately the pressure of the ambient air, the highly transparent portion 25 of the wall 22 of the second enclosure 18 may comprise an opening therein and the gas 24 inside the second enclosure 18 can be substantially separated from the air around it either by a gas curtain passing along the opening at 25 or by the object 12 to which the X rays 11 are to be provided, or a component associated with the object 12 such as the mask 26 in Figure 1 or the sample 32 in Figure 2 , placed against the wall 22 and covering the opening at 25. The second enclosure 18 may have an intermediate compartment 34, as in Figure 1, between the common wall portion 19 and the wall 22 having the highly transparent portion 25 the gas in the intermediate compartment 34 being maintained at a pressure less than the pressure in the vicinity of the highly transparent portion 25 of the wall 22 of the second enclosure 18 and greater than the pressure in the first enclosure 16. As is shown in Figure 2, typical apparatus according to the invention for obtaining EXAFS data of a material, comprises also spectral dispersive means such as a monochromator 30 in the second enclosure 18 so located as to receive X rays 11 that pass through the opening and to direct the spectrally resolved X rays 11R on toward the highly transparent portion 25 of the wall 22 adjacent to the object 12 to which the X rays lIR are to be provided, and the object 12 typically comprises recording means such as a photographic film 12. Such apparatus typically comprises also means such as a support not shown for positioning a sample of material 31 in the optical path of the X rays ll,llR, either in the second enclosure 18 as indicated by the dashed line 31, or outside of the second enclosure 18 and between the highly transparent portion 25 of the wall 22 and the recording means 12, as indicated at 32. The latter position 32 usually is more convenient than positions such as 31 in the second enclosure 18. Typically the radiant energy 14 is directed to the target 15 in a single pulse in such manner as to produce soft X rays 11 from the target 15 in a single pulse in such manner as to produce soft X rays 11 from the target 15 suitable for obtaining the EXAFS spectrum of the material 32, which typically is an element having an atomic number of less than 40. EXAFS apparatus as in Figure 2 may comprise also means for moving the surface of the target 15 typically in a rotating and advancing motion not shown to provide a helical locus of points on a cylindrical surface of the target 15 travelling through the location of the focal spot 28 where the laser light energy 14 strikes the surface. In such a case the energy 14 typically is directed to the moving target surface at 28 in a series of pulses in such manner as to produce softX rays 11 from the target 15 suitable for obtaining theEXAFS spectrum of the material 32. The X rays from the target 15 preferably comprise continuum radiation in a selected EXAFS spectral regime of the sample 32. Typically the target 15 comprises essentially an element having a continuum just above theL lines that includes a selected EXAFS spectral regime of the sample 32. Or the target 15 may comprise a plurality of elements whose lines are spaced closely enough to form virtually a continuum in a selected EXAFS spectral regime of the sample 11. Such a target 15 typically comprises a mixture of elements of adjacent atomic numbers. The radiant energy typically comprises a laser pulse 14 with a power density of at least about 1013 watts per square centimeter, and the target 15 typically comprises a solid typically metal surface, whereby a surface plasma is formed and raised to the kilovolt temperature regime. Some EXAFS can be obtained, however, in the ultraviolet and ultrasoft X ray regime using lower power densities down to about lOll watts per square centimeter. The laser pulse 14 typically is focused to strike the focal spot 28 on the taget 15 about 1 to 200 micrometers in diameter. Further typical and preferred details of apparatus of the type shown in Figure 2 for obtaining EXAFS data of a material are contained in the United States patent application of Philip J. Mallozzi, Harold M. Epstein,Rober E. Schwerzel, and Bernerd E. Campbell, for LaserEXAFS Serial No. 105,816, filed December 20, 1979 nowUnited States Patent issued As is explained in detail.in the United States patent of Mallozzi et al., referred to in the Background section herein, a typical method of producing X rays for use in the present invention comprises directing radiant energy from a laser onto a target, and conversion efficiency of at least about 3 percent is obtained by providing the radiant eneryy in a low power precursor pulse of approximately uniform effective intensity focused onto the surface of the target for about 1 to 30 nanoseconds so as to generate an expanding unconfined coronal plasma having less than normal solid density throughout and comprising a low density underdense region wherein the plasma frequency is less than the laser radiation frequency and a higher density overdense region wherein the plasma frequency is greater than the laser radiation frequency and, about 1 to 30 nanoseconds after the precursor pulse strikes the target, a hiher power main pulse focused onto the plasma for about 10 3 to 30 nanoseconds and having such power density and total energy that the radiant energy is absorbed in the underdense region and conducted into the overdense region to heat it and thus to produce X rays therefrom with the plasma remaining substantially below normal solid density and thus facilitating the substantial emission of X rays in the form of spectral lines arising from nonequilibrium ionization states. The target typically consists essentially of an element having a high atomic number Z, i.e., an atomic number Z greater than 10. Typically the target consists essentially of iron, calcium, chromium, nickel, aluminum, lead, tungsten, or gold. The amplitude, duration, and shape of the precursor pulse typically are adjusted to control the intensity and spectral content of the X rays. The precursor pulse typically comprises about 0.01 to 5 joules about 1010 to 1012 watts per square centimeter in about 1 to 30 nanoseconds, and strikes the target at an angle of about 20 to 70 degrees from its surface. The main pulse typically comprises at least 0.1 joule, preferably about 10 to 200 joules in about 1 to 3 nanoseconds. In a typical embodiment, the target consists essentially of iron and the duration of the precursor pulse is about 8 to 10 nanoseconds. The electron density in the low density region of the plasma typically is about 1016 to 1021 per cubic centimeter, and in the higher density region about 1019 to 1025 per cubic centimeter. The radiant energy typically is focused onto a spot on the target having a diameter of about 1 to 1000 micrometers. The volume of the plasma typically is about 10 6 to 10 3 cubic centi meter, the thickness of the plasma in any direction being about 0.001 to 0.1 centimeter. For low energy applications the X rays are emitted predominantly in the form of spectral lines. The radiant energy may be focused onto a spot on the target having a diameter of about 1 to 100 micrometers, generating a plasma of about the same diameter, to form substantially a point source of X rays and thus to provide substantially the advantages of stimulated emission of X rays. In some embodiments of the invention the composition of the target and the temperature of the plasma are selected to provide a substantial amount of stimulated emission of X rays. In other embodiments X rays are directed to impinge upon a fluorescent target so as to remove inner shell electrons from atoms thereof and thereby create a population inversion. In a typical method of providing stimulated emission of X rays by directing radiant energy onto a target to create by means of a pumping mechanism some upper and lower laser levels, the required population inversion is not established by the pumping mechanism alone, but by the combined action of the pumping mechanism and a quenching mechanism that extinguishes the lower laser level at a rate sufficient to establish and continuously maintain the inversion. The pumping mechanism typically comprises excitation by collisions of electrons and ions or by dielectronic recombination.The quenching mechanism typically comprises Auger transitions, Coster KroEig transitions, or collisions.The radiant energy may be from a laser, or it may comprise a beam of electrons. The pumping mechanism may comprise a beam of electrons.APPLICABILITY Apparatus according to the present invention is especially useful for applications wherein it is expensive, time consuming, or otherwise inconvenient to move objects that are to receive soft X rays into and out of a special environment, such as a vacuum chamber in which the X rays are produced. Typical applications o this type include laser produced X ray systems for high resolution lithography, for extended X ray absorption fir1e structure EXAFS spectroscopy, and for X ray microscopy. X r2ys usually are produced in a vacuum, but for many purposes it is desirable to apply them in air. Sor soft X rays, especially those having photon energies of less than about 5 keV, a problem arises in bringing the X rays from the vacuum into air, because a window that is thick enough and strong enough to withstand the pressure difference between the vacuum and the air is opaque to the X rays, except in very small windows. The problem is especially serious in X ray lithography, where it is desirable to illuminate large areas. The present invention provides simple, inexpensive convenient means for overcoming the problem of providingX rays to an object that may be in an ordinary environment such as air at approximately atmospheric pressure. Apparatus according to this invention is useful and advantageous not only in X ray lithography but also in laser EXAFS, and especially in fast EXAFS spectroscopy with a single pulse of laser produced X rays,. or with a plurality of such pulses. The technique of Extended X ray Absorption FineStructure EXAFS spectroscopy is becoming ars increasingly important tool for the study of chemical structure in samples which lack long range order, such as amorphous solids, solutions of biologically important materials, and gases. These studies have gained impetus in recent years by virtue of the availability of synchrotron radiation, which provides a continuous and intense spectrum of the soft X rays required for EXAFS. A synchrotron, however, is an expensive, cumbersome source of X rays, to which scientists must travel in order to perform their experiments. A laser X ray source, on the other hand, is relatively compact, inexpensive, and simple to operate and maintain.Furthermore, there are a variet of novelEXAFS experiments which are inherently beyond te capabilities of synchrotron radiation sources. These experiments, which require short pulse width, intense fluxes of low energy 4 keV X rays, and or a continuum or a closely packed spectral line structure, are ideally suited to laser produced X rays. The EXAFS spectrum of aluminum has been measured with a nanosecond pulse of soft X rays generated by a laser produced plasma. This technique provides a practical alternative to synchrotron radiation for the acquisition of EXAFS data. It also provides a unique capability for the analysis of molecular structure in highly transient chemical species. While the forms of the invention herein disclosed constitute presently preferred embodiments, many others are possible. It is not intended herein to mention all of the possible equivalent forms of ramifications of the invention. It is to be understood that the terms used herein are merely descriptive rather than limiting, and that various changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.
