# A goose neck connector for a roll trailer.

## Abstract
A removable goose neck connector 12 for a roll trailer is formed as a Z shaped member having an arm 17 for introduction into a corresponding pocket 14 in the trailer. The arm is provided with a displaceable latching member 20 , which may be brought to cooperate with a recess 22 formed within the pocket. The latching member is preferably remotely controlled from the towing vehicle.

## Description
A G OSE .E h CONNECTOR FOR A ROLL TRAILER A certain type of roll trailers is provides with a SO called goo.e neck connector adapted to be hitched to a vehicle when the trailer is to be movedThe connector will project forward of the platform of tulle trailer, and is a hinderance when the trailer is parked, either it is empty or is loaded. On man occasions the connector has there fore been designed as a disconnectable member, which normally is mounted upon the vehicle and is provided with an arm, which during transportation is retained in a pocket at the trailer. The arm is usually, at its distal end, provided with a downwardly directed projection, which engages a recess in bottom wall of the pocket. The arm will mainly be kept in place due to friction, when the connector is lifted upwards by the vehicle. When the carriage set runs over un even ground, moverients in the vertical direction may occur, which tend to loosen the frictional engagement between the arrii and the pocket, Different latching devices at the distal end of the arm have been proposed but have often contained brackets protruding from the forward end of the trailer, and are usually so designed, that the driver rust leave his seat in order to perform the final connection The aim of the present invention is to propose a disconnectable connector device, which on tho on hand is designed so it does not obstruet the introduetion of the arm into the pocket, and in the second hand dans net require any elements at the trailer, projecting from the forward end thereof. A further aim of the invention is to design the device in such a manner, that it may be remotely controlled t roiii the tli I cle. A connector according to the invent ion i characterlzed in a latching member fitted within the connector an and being shiftable between two positions tor cooperation with a recess within the pocket. The latching member is preferably connected to a pressure fluid ran provided we thin the connector and arranged for remote control from the vehicle to which the connector is hitched. One embodiment of the invention will below be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in whichFigure 1 schematically shows a roll trailer carriage,Figure 2 shows a detail of the goose neck connector and the connection pocket,Figure 3 shows the connector, as viewed from above, and cut open along line Ill ill in Figure 2, andFigure 4 shows a modified embodiment of the latching member. The roll trailer carriage showy in Figure 1 includes a towing vehicle 10 and a trailer 11, which by means of a goose neck connector 12 is hitched to the vehicle. The trailer is supported by wheels 13 at its end remote from connector. The forward end of the trailer must be carried by a vehicle during transportation. The goose neck connector 12 is, however, not permanently connected to the trailer, but is connectable at a pocket 14 in the front part thereof. Such a connector is a Z shaped element, which at its forward end is provided with a pin 15, adapted to engage centrally in a turntable 1tz, provided at the vehicle. The end of the connector remote i roni thp pin i formed as all an 17, adapted to slide into pocket 14 at trailer 11.The rllollnl ing at turntable 16 is designed in such a manner, thit the connector may b retained in a definite POSitiOI1 ill relation to the vehicle, and with the connector at an inclination to facilitate the introduction of its an into pocket 14, when the trailer rests upon its wheels 13 and upon the housing enclosing pocket 14, or upon some other support. The vehicle is provided with a pressure fluid operated rari 18 for raising and lowering the turntable.The arm 17 of tlie connector is introduced into the pocket while the turntable 16 remains in a lowered position, and the front end of the trailer is raised, when connection has been made, by lifting turntable 16. The connector arm 17 is provided with a downwardly directed projection 19 at its distal end, for cooperation with a mating recess in the bottom wall of pocket 14. This projection will transfer a major part of the tractive force to the trailer. In order to ensure an efficient connection between the arm and the pocket, arm 17 is provided with a latching member, formed as a pivotable hook 20. This is mounted in a groove 21 in the arm proper, and is designed in such a manner that it will not, during the introduction of the arm into the pocket, project outside of the arm, thus forming no hinderance. Hook 20 may be swung upwards so it engages a recess 22 in the top wall of the pocket, and may thus lock the arm in relation to the pocket. Hook 20 is operated b means of a fluid pressure ram 23, which is mounted in the middle position of the connector. The ram is, by means of conduits 24a,b, connected to a governing valve inside the driver s cabin, so the driver need not leave his cabin to make the connection. As is best evident from Figure 3 the conner tor is built up froni at l beam structure 2 , to which sid, plates 26 have btii welded, so a Cl ,ed box structure is obtained. The ram 23 is mounted in an opening 27 cut out from tlle waist of the Iiean, and conduits 24a arf well protected swithin til box structure of the connector, until they reach about to turntable l . There they are coupled to hoses 24b of sufficient length, and freely running, to permit turning movements of the goose neck connector in relation to the vehicle.Conduits 24b are, in turn, connected to the governing valve, mentioned above, within the driver S cabin Figure 4 shows a modified erribodiment of the latching member. Whenever possible the same reference numerals as in Figure 2 are used. The latching member proper is here formed as a catch plate Oa, pivotable about an axis 30, and having a projecting nose 31 suited for engagement with recess 22. The catch plate, 2Da, is manipulated by means of a lever 32, which engages a notch 33 in the edge of the plate and is operated from ram 23. This catching member operates otherwise in the same manner as described above. The latching member thus does not include any parts protruding outside the connector at the end thereof to be introduced into the pocket, and will be remotely controlled from the driver s cabin. The design of the latching member may vary, and it is possible to use an axially displaceable bolt.
