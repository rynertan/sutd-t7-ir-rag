# Improvements in or relating to the repetitive cutting of workpiece blanks.

## Abstract
The invention provides a method of working with a travelling head press to cut rows of identical workpieces across wide sheet material. The combination of the press and the means feeding the sheet material through it is so arranged that rows of workpieces can be cut on the bias along transverse lines at an angle other than a rightangle to the direction of feed of the material, for best utilisation of the material, and this bias angle can be changed to suit different workpiece shapes and different cutting tools without reorien tation of the press base. In one embodiment a press is used which is constructed to swivel on its base and in another embodiment the sheet material is fed forward by the feeding means by equal incremental amounts between successive cutting strokes during the cutting of a row of workpieces.
