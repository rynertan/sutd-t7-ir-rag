## Description
Solid state imaging apparatus The present invention relates to an improvement in solid state imaging apparatus having two dimensionally disposed photodiodes with electronic switches for scanningly taking out outputs of the photosensitive elements.2. DescriPtion of the Prior Art There have been many proposals of the solid state imaging apparatuses, wherein various signal collecting means such as MD6 FET type or CCD type are used. On the other hand there are several proposals for scanning method of such devices. In general, in order to meet NTSC standard, the apparatus is designed to make the known interlace scannings.That is, as shown in FIG. 1 A , in a solid state apparatus having the two dimensionally disposed phtosensitive elements 101,a scanning for a first field is made as shown by solid state horizontal lines0 The scanning is made every two lines by skipping one lines inbetween, and in a second field every two lines shown by dotted horizontal lines which have not been scanned in the first field scanning, are scanned sequentially. As one of modification of the abovementioned interlace scanning method, there is a method which can be called two line interlace scanning, such as disclosed in the Japanese published unexamined PatentApplication Sho 51 56123.The above mentioned two line interlace scanning is elucidated referring to FIG. 1 B , wherein in the first field scanning, adjacent picture elements of two lines L1 and L2 and subsequently L3 and L4, and subsequently L5 and L6 are simultaneously scanned as shown by solid horizontal lines. And in the second field scanning, scanning is made shifting by one line, that is horizontal lines L2 and L3 are simultaneously scanned, and subsequently the horizontal lines L4 and L5 are simultaneously scanned. Such two line interlace scanning has advantage in improved after image characteristic. The reason of the advantage is elucidated as follows. One prior art example of such two line interlace scanning method is shown in FIG. 2 wherein selection gate 209 for each photodiode 210 as picture element is connected to receive control signal from horizontal read out signal line 217, and to give output signal to vertical line 218. In FIG. 1 A and FIG. 1 B , the solid horizontal lines indicate horizontal scannings in the first field and the dotted horizontal lines indicate horizontal scannings in the second field, and Hni Hn l, Hn 2 ... indicate nth, n l th, n 2 th ... lines of the first field, respectively, and hun H Hn 2 ... indicate nth, n l th, n 2 th .,. lines of the second field, respectively. The horizontal control signal line 217 consisting of n lines, L2,112, L3 11n Ln are made conductive at positive potential of the horizontal lines. Second selection gate 203 and 204 are for switching among the vertical lines 218 consisting of tl l2, t3 m g so as to control signals on the vertical lines to output terminals 215 and 216. The second selection gate 203 and 204 are selectively switched on by signals from horizontal shift register 201, which is for selective switching on of the second selection gates 203 and 204 for a horizontal scanning, to produce horizontally scanned output signal to the output terminals 215 and 216.That is, the output terminals 215 and 216 are sequentially connected to selected vertical read out signal lines b and 2,or Q3 and Q4vor and Q6 ... On the other hand, field signal pulse is impressed on either terminal 213 or 214 depending on the first field or the second field, respectively. Accordingly, in the first field the line selection gates 205 and 206 are switched on by the field signal impressed on the field signal terminal 213, and in the second field the line selection gates 207 and 208 are switched on by field signal impressed on the field signal terminal 214. Thus in the first field, in a first line scanning the pair of lines L1 and L2 are impressed with H signals, and in the second line scanning the pair of the third and fourth lines L3 and 114 are impressed with H signals. On the other hand, in the second field, in the first line scanning the pair of the horizontal linesL2 and L3 are impressed with H signal, while in the second scanning the pair of horizontal lines L4 and 115 are impressed with H signal.Vertical shift register 202 sequentially impresses vertical control signal on the horizontal lines 217, L1, L2 t so as to give read out signal to the first selection gates 209 and 211 so as to switch them on thereby to make vertical scanning.That is, in the first field the vertical control signal pulses are issued from the vertical shift register 202 to the pair of lines Q1 and Q2 the pair of lines Q3 and Q4, ....., and in the second field to the pair of lines Q2 and the pair of lines Q4 and Q52... . Thus. photoelectric signals of the photoelectric element is issued through the first selection gates 209 and 211, and through the second selection gates 203 and 204 to the output terminals 215 and 216, respectively, thereby to make the two line scanning as shown in FIG. 1 B . The above mentioned prior art example apparatus has a shortcoming of producing flicker depending on the condition of driving as disclosed in an article TelevisionGakkai arcade 1981 National Conference Report, p. 63, Ando et al. Outline of the shortcoming is elucidated hereafter. The photodiodes 210, 212 ... have stray capacities C1 andC2 with the horizontal read out signal lines 217. And in the first field, the control signal from the vertical shift resister 202 is impressed in the first field to the pair of L1 L2 t L3 L4 ,... , and in the second field to the pair of L2 L3, L4 Lg ..., ..., respectively.Accordingly, respective photodiodes under the read out condition are in the following states. In the first field, the photodiode 210 is impressed with control signals of the horizontal lines L1 and 112 through the stray capacities Clland C2 , while in the second field the photodiode 210 is impressed with the control signal of the horizontal lineL2 only, since in the second line the horizontal line k has no vertical control signal. In the similar way, the photodiode 212 is impressed with, in the first field,the control signal of the horizontal line L2 only, and in the second field, with both the control signal of the horizontal lines L2 and 113 That is, in the first field and in the second field, the photodiodes 210 and 212 receive different voltages originated by the control signals on the horizontal lines to the stray capacities. And this difference of the control pulses given on the photodiodes causes undesirable fractuation of output signals field by field, that is,a flickering of picture produced. In order to eliminate such flickering, one measure to be considered may be to minimize the undesirable stray capacities. However, since the solid state imaging apparatus have a large number of photodiodes on a very small wafer together with a number of wiring lines, it is almost impossible to substantially eliminate the stray capacities.Summary of the Invention Accordingly, the present invention proposes a novel improved configuration of the solid state imaging apparatus wherein the above mentioned shortcomings of the prior art can be eliminated. That is, in the apparatus in accordance with the present invention, horizontal read out lines L1, L2, L3 ... 11n are connected directly to respective output terminals of a vertical shift register 302, and within one horizontal scanning type period, at least two vertical control pulses are issued at differrent time points from each other to neighboring two stages of the vertical shift register 302 so as to readout photoelectric signals of each other neighboring lines therewith. Thereby, in reading out, signals of photodiodes 305 connected to one horizontal line L1 are read out at one time point, and signals of photodiodes connected to next horizontal line L2 are read out at a little later time point. By such configuration, the influences of vertical control signals on the horizontal lines L1 and L2,... to the photodiodes 345 through the stray capacities can be substantially eliminated, thereby enabling elimination of flickering.Brief Explanation of the Drawing FIG. 1 A is a schematic front view of the prior art solid state imaging apparatus of conventional interlace scanning.

In comparison with the circuit configuration of the prior art solid state imaging apparatus of FIG. 2 the line selection gates connected between the horizontal lines L1, L2 Ln L and the output terminals of the vertical 111, 112 n shift register are omitted in the embodiment circuit ofFIG. 3, and the vetical shift register 302 has the same number of stages as that of the horizontal lines L1... Ln. The vertical shift register 302 is known circuit as such and is constituted as shown in FIG. 4. Principle of operation of the circuit of FIG. 4 is elucidated with reference to waveforms of FIG. 5 wherein a pair of clock signal 1 and 2 are impressed on the input terminsls and 2 of FIG. 4, respectively. A starting pulse ST shown in FIG. 5 is impressed to a starting pulse input terminal ST of FIG. 4. The output terminals 1 2 3 ... correspond to the output terminals 01, 2 3 ... of the vertical shift register 302 of FIG. 3, respectively. In FIG. 5, at a time point to, the clock pulse cbl is H thereby making a MOS FET 400 of FIG. 4 ON.And at that time the clock pulse 2 is at L potential, thereby making aMOS FET 404 OFF. As a result of ON state of the MOS FET 400, the drain N1 of the MOS FET 400 is held at H potential.On the other, since the clock pulse 2 is at L, a capacitance C1 between the second clock signal input terminal and the drain N1 is charged to H potential. Thereby, switching two series connected MOS FET 401 and 402 ON, and switching a MOS FET 403 OFF. As a result, output terminal Ol turns to L potential by connection to the second clock signal terminal 2 through the MOS FET 402. Then at a time point tl, the second clock signal 2 turns to H potential, and the first clock signal turns to L potential, and the starting signal ST becomes to L potential. Accordingly, the MOS FET 400, 402 and 403 turn to cut off state, and therefore the MOS FET 401 is kept in ON state by means of voltage across the capacitance C1 At this time, a MOS FET 404 is ON, and at this time point of tl, the output terminal Ol turns to H potential by connection through the MOS FET 401 to the second clock pulse terminal 2 At the same time, the capacitance C2 is charged to make a point N2 as a result of charging through the ON state transistor 404 and 401. Nextly, when it becomes to a time point t2, theMOS FET 400 turns on as a result of H state of the first clock signal 1 and being at L potentials of the starting signal fST and the second clock signal 2 the charge of the capacitor C1 is discharged through the MOS FET 400.Accordingly, the MOS FET 401 is cut off, thereby the output terminal 1 is kept at L potential. On the other hand the MOS FET 405 turns on by means of the charged voltage across the capacitance C2, making the MOS FET 406 and 407 cut off. Accordingly, the output terminal 2 becomes to H potential by connection through the MOS FET 405 to the first clock signal terminal 1 At the same time the MOS FET 408 turns on as the clock signal becomesH, and a capacitance C3 is charged, thereby making a point N3 toH potential. Similarly to the above mentioned first output terminal 017 upon becoming L of the first clock signal 1 the output terminal 02 becomes L, but at this time the voltage across the capacitance C3 is kept since the MOS FET 408 is cut off. Nextly, at the time point t3 the MOS FET 409 is ON and the capacitance C3 is charged, and the MOS FET 410 and 411 are cut off. Accordingly, the output terminal 1 is H since it is connected to the second clock signal terminal through the MOS FET 409. At this time, being given H potential at its gate from the output terminal O3, the MOSFET 403 is ON, and the MOS FET 404 turns ON since second clock signal terminal 2 is H. Also, at this time first signal clock 1 is L and MOS FET 404 and 403 are ON, and charge in the capacitance C2 is discharged through the MOSFET 403 and 404, thereby cutting off the MOS FET 405.At the same time, H potential of the output terminal O3 charges the capacitor C4 through MOS FET 412 which is switched on by H potential of the clock signal 2 By repeating the above mentioned operations, pulse potential input to the input terminal fST in turn makes the output terminals Oli 02, O3 ... to H potential responding to incoming of the pulses of clock signals 1 and The above explanation is made for clock signals 91 and 2 shown in FIG. 6, but in actual operation of FIG. 3 the clock signals 1 and 2 of modified timing as shown inFIG. 6 A and FIG. 6 B should be used, and the output signals 01 2 3 4 ... are obtained as shown in FIG. 6 A and FIG.6 B . And by using the output signals of FIG. 6 A in a first field of the interlace and the output signal of FIG. 6 B in the second field, respectively, a desired operation ofFIG 3 is obtainable. That is, the vertical shift register 302 produces output pulses O1, 3 5 ... at each pulses of the second clock signal 2 and issues output pulses 02, 2 O4i ... at pulses of the first clock signal And by inversing the order of phase of the first clock signal 1 and the second clock signal 2 as shown in FIG. 6 A and FIG. 6 B , pulsetrain of output signals at output terminals O1, 2 3 04 ... is obtainable as shown in FIG. 6 A and FIG. 6 B . That is, in the first field shown in FIG. 6 A , input signal ST fed into the vertical shift register 302 at the time point of the pulse of the.first clock signal 1 is output to the first output terminal 1 at the time point of the pulse of the second clock signal 2 after one horizontal scanning time period H, and to the output terminal O2 2 the pulse is issued at the time point of a pulse in the second clock signal 2 immediately after the above mentioned output to the first output terminal 01. And with respect to the output terminals O3 and O4, the above mentioned steps at the output terminals Ol and 2 repeat in the same way.Accordingly, the output signals are issued, making signal pairs of pair Ol and 2 pair O3 and O4, ... repeating at every time period of one horizontal scanning. In the second field shown in FIG. 6 B , input signal fsT7fed into the vertical shift register 302 at the time point of the pulse of the first clock signal 1 is output to the first output terminal Ol at the time point of the pulse of the second clock signal after one horizontal scanning time period H, and to the output terminal O2 the pulse is issued at the time point of a pulse in the second clock signal 2 immediately after the above mentioned output to the first output terminal 01. And with respect to the output terminals O4 and O5, the above mentioned steps at the output terminals 0 and 2 nd 03 repeat in the same way. Accordingly, the output signals are issued making such sianal pairs as pair 2 and O3, pair O4 and 0 O5, ...,repeating at an 4 d O . . .repeating at every time period of one horizontal scanning. Overall explanation of the solid state imaging apparatus of FIG. 3 is elucidated hereafter. Objective image projected on the photodiodes 305 is converted into electric signal by the photodiode 305, and the electric signal is read out through a first selection gate 315 controlled by control signal even through a first horizontal line 307 L1 , and through a vertical line 306 Q1 and further through a second selection gate 303 to a first output terminal 308. Output signal from the photodiode 305 of the second line is similarly read out through another first selection gate 316, through another vertical line l2 and further through another second selection gate 304 to a second output terminal 309.The second selection gates 303 and 304 are controlled by a horizontal shift register 301, thereby horizontally scanning the output signal in the horizontal direction. The vertical shift register 302, as has been elucidated, is driven in the manner as elucidated with reference to FIG. 6 A and FIG. 6 B . Accordingly, as has been elucidated with reference to FIG. 4 and FIG. 6 A andFIG. 6 B , the control signal impressed on the horizontal lines 307 are impressed on a pair of L1 and L2, a next pair of L3 and L4, further next pair of L5 and L6 ... in the first field. And in the second field, control pulses are impressed on a pair of L2 and L3, another pair of 114 and L5, ... . Thus the above mentioned simultaneous twoline vertical scanning is made.Since the control output signal from the output terminals 01, 2 3 ... are directly given to the horizontal lines L1, L2, L3 respectively, the horizontal lines receive vertical control signals 1 2 031 4 ... of FIG. 6 A or FIG. 6 B . That is in a manner that the control signal pairs Ol and 02,or O3 and O4 , ... ofFIG. 6 A , or O2 and O3, or 04 and O5,... in FIG. 6 B are given with small time differences between the pulses within each pair as shown in FIG. 6 A and FIG. 6 B . That is, only one control signal from the vertical shift register 302 is given to horizontal line group 307 at one time, and therefore every photodiodes 305, 305 ... are given with equal charges through stray capacities from the horizontal lines, and therefore no flickering is substantially produced. Incidentally, in FIG. 6 A and FIG. 6 B , the starting signal ST has covered . timing of both pulses of each prior of the clock signals 1 and 2 but apart from the above example, it is only necessary that the starting signal ST should be in synchronism merely to the first clock signal 1 And the first pulse of the second clock signal 27which is within a timid covered by the duty time of the signal pulse of the starting signal fSTvis not necessarily required. As has been elucidated, the embodiment of FIG. 3 has no shortcoming of the flickering and furthermore, switching devices which has been necessitated between the output terminals of the vertical shift register and the horizontal lines can be eliminated. The read out signals of a photodiode 305 and a next photodiode 305 are given to the output terminals 308 and. 309 through the first selection switches 315 and 316, and second selection switches 303 and 304, respectively, by controlling of a corresponding stage of the horizontal shift register 301. And the two read out signals at the output terminals 308 and 309 which are read out by two pulses in the same pair, such as Ol and for O3 and 04 inFIG. 6 A , or 2 and 03,or O4 and 0, in FIG. 6 B , are always summed up by a circuit not shown in FIG. 3 to produce one signal of a picture element of one horizontal line of the two line scanning.Since all the signals are used after summing up two signals of neighboring lines at corresponding horizontal position, even if some spurious signal is generated, for instance, due to noises given through stray capacities or the like, the summing up of the two signals substantially eliminates adverse effect of such spurious signal in the reproduced picture. In the example of FIG. 3 FIG. 4 to be oper ated as shown in FIG. 6 A and FIG. 6 B , horizontal lines of neighboring dispositions are connected to corresponding ones of the output terminals 02, 04 ... and the output terminals 01 03 ..., thus utilizing all the output terminals of the vertical shift register 302, which hitherto are not utilized in the conventional circuit. Therefore, substantially the same shift register as the prior art circuit can be used. Clock signals 1 and 2 of FIG. 6 A and FIG. 6 B can be produced, for instance, by using a circuit shown in FIG. 7 wherein double phase driving pulses a and b are interchangedly issued by means of control signal fF H, L . In embodying the present invention the same effect is obtainable even by connecting the horizontal line 111, 112, ... and output terminals 01, 02 ... in the combination Ol to L 03 to L2 O5 to L3 O2 to L1O4 to L2 6 to L3 EMI16.1 .............. 1 , or .............. 2 . In the above mentioned cases of connections, utility of the shift register is equal to that of the conventional shift register, and only odd number output or even number output of the shift register are utilized. In this case, the input clock signals to the vertical shift register are as shown in FIG. 8 A and FIG. 8 B which show the cases of utilizing the odd number output 011 031 5 ... of the shift register. the circuit configurations for the example of FIG. 8 A and FIG. 8 B are shown in FIG. 8 C and FIG. 8 D , respectively. In FIG. 8 C , wherein the shift register 302 has about 2n stages, line L1, L2, L3 ... are connected to the output terminals 01, 031 05 . .In FIG. 8 D , the output connection of the shift register 302 is made between even number output terminals and sequential horizontal lines, that is, output terminals 021 041 06 ... are connected to the horizontal lines L1, L2, L3 ... In the examples of FIG. 8 C and FIG. 8 D , the first clock signal 1 and the second clock signal 2 each has two pulses within every horizontal scanning period time, thereby shifting the shift register 302 for two steps in each horizontal scanning time, thereby sending two paired pulsesO1 and O3, or 05 and O7, or 03 and O5, or O7 and 09 ... to paired neighboring two horizontal lines. The switching for the fields is made by shifting the phase of the ST pulses with respect to the clock signals 1 and 2 as shown in FIG. 8 A and FIG. 8 B .Thus in FIG. 8 A , within one horizontal scanning line time period H, pair pulses O1 and O3, or O5 and 07...as in FIG. 8 A or the pair pulses O3 and 05, or O7 and O9 ... as in FIG. 8 B are obtainable. Instead of the above mentioned example of FIG. 8 A and FIG. 8 B , where pulse fST has duty time and phase such as to cover the timing of pulses of the clock signals 1 and 2,the duty time ofthe pulse fST may be such that it covers only the pulse of the first clock signal 1 and it is sufficient that the duty time of the pulse fST covers only the timing of a pulse of the first clock signal 1 In the case of FIG. 8 B , the first pulses of 1 and 2 do nothing in the shift register, accordingly these first pulses may be omitted. FIG. 9 shows a modired example of the clock signals wherein clock signal 2 is only an inversed signal to the clock signal of 1 In such case the clock signal generator can be simplified. Instead of the direct coupling of the output terminals of the vertical shift register 302 or 302 and the horizontal lines L1, L2, L3 ... , connection between the shift register output terminals and the horizontal lines can be made with a buffer circuit inbetween as shown inFIG. 10 or FIG. 11. In FIG. 10, the buffer circuit 2000 has source todrain series connected MOS FET 1001 1002, 1001 1002 and gate of the first MOS FETs 1001, 1001 ... are connected to the output terminal Ol 02.. of the shift register 302, and gates of the other MOS FETs 1002, 1002 ... are common connected to the clock signal input terminalAnd sources of the MOS FET 1001, 1001 ... are connected to positive power source terminal. And junction points 1 2 ... between the source drain series connection are connected to the horizontal lines L1, L2 . . This circuit can provide the same control signals as the preceding examples and further enables to adjust DC mean potential of the horizontal lines. FIG. 11 shows still another modification which has another buffer circuit 2001 between the shift register and the horizontal lines. The buffer circuit comprises a set of latches 1105, 1105 Each latch 1105 ... comprises MOS FET 1101, 1102, 1103 and capacitor 1104, wherein a pair of clock signals 3 and 3 which is inverse to 3, are impressed, and thereby the output pulses of the shift register 302 are latched. The transistors 1101, 1102 and 1103 perform similar functions as those of transistors 400, 401, 401, 402 and C1 of FIG. 4.Each of the circuits 1105, 1105 , 1105 ... performs such function that under the impression of the clock pulse f3, input signal is applied across the capacitor C through the transistor 1101, and under impression of the clock pulse 3 the signal across the capacitor 1104 is read out to the output terminal Ollr and the output is given as the potential of the pulse 3 which is given through the transistor 1102.Accordingly, the pulse 3 should cover the timing of the inverse signal of the logic sum of the signals 1 and 2. For instance, if clock signal pulses 2 and 3 as shown in FIG. 11 are used, then output pulses of the additional shift registers 1105 1005 1005 ... are issued in synchronism with the clock signal 3. Accordingly, the horizontal lines can receive the control signals in the same way as that of the preceding examples. In the examples FIG. 10 and FIG. 11, vertical control voltages to be impressed on the horizontal lines L1, L2, L3 ... are all equal. Accordingly, reading out conditions for all of one horizontal array of the photo electric devices are equal each other. As has been elucidated, in case of two line simultaneous reading of the picture elements since two sequential horizontal scanning output signals are utilized after combining together, even though the signal levels of L1, L3, Lg ... and the signal level of 112, L4, L6 ... are different from each other, the signals to form picture signals are sum of the signals on L1 and L2, or L3 and L4, or ... .Therefore, no adverse fractuation of brightness takes place. On the contrary if output signals of a horizontal row of the photoelectric devices are utilized independently, as has been elucidated with reference to the prior art of FIG. 2, differences of brightness due to differences of stray capacitances cause undesirable brightness fractuation. For instance, two line scanning is made by impressing the vertical control signals on L1 and L2, or L3 and L4, or 115 and L6, ..., then the combined horizontal scanning signals necessarily include difference between signals produced by scanning respective horizontal lines.Therefore, as has been elucidated, when the differences of the influences of the vertical control scanning signals are not desirable, it is necessary to use the circuit ofFIG. 8, FIG. 10 or FIG. 11, wherein the difference of influences of the vertical control signals are eliminated. In case of FIG. 8, FIG. 10 and fig. 11, the brightness fractuation problems have been overcome. However, in case of FIG. 8 circuit, number of stage of the vertical shift register 302 become twice as large as the number of the vertical shift register of FIG. 2. But in the circuits of FIG. 10 and FIG. 11, the number of stages of the vertical shift registers are the same as that of FIG. 2, accordingly the circuit configuration and cost is moderate. Furthermore, in the circuits of FIG. 10 and FIG.11, the circuit is advantageous with regard to driving pulse voltage. That is, in the circuit of FIG. 10, in order to turn on MOS FET, for instance 1001, it is necessary to provide a driving pulse which is higher by threshold voltage of the MOS FET above that of the output terminal 1 of the shift register. On the other hand in the example of FIG. 11, bootstrap circuit is constituted by a capacitor 1104, therefore the voltage of the MOS FET 1102 easily turns on the MOS FET 1102 if the output potential of the shift register Ol is higher than the threshold value. As a result, in case equal voltages are impressed on the horizontal lines L1, L2, L3 ..., the voltages of the clock signal pulses 1 and 2 to be impressed on the shift register 302 can be made lower in FIG. 11 in comparison with the case of the FIG. 10.
