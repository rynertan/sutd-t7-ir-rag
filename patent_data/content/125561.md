# Data processing system having multi buffer adapter between a system channel and an input output bus.

## Abstract
A data processing system 10 has a block multiplexed system channel 30 coupled to a processing engine 20 and a byte multiplexed bus 50 coupled to multiple I O devices 40 . A multi buffer adapter 60 transfers data by cycle steal direct memory access operations between the channel 30 and the bus 50 . The adapter has multiple buffers 62 switchable to the channel 30 in a burst mode by a channel interface 61 and to the bus 50 in a byte mode by a device level interface 63 .
