The compounds of formula I of the present invention are useful in the treatment of various memory dysfunctions characterized by decreased cholinergic function, such as Alzheimer s disease. This utility is manifested by the ability of these compounds to inhibit the enzyme cholinesterase and thereby increase acetylcholine levels in the brain. Additionally, some of the compounds of this invention exhibit antidepressant activities, which activities being particularly helpful for patients suffering from Alzheimer s disease. Further, the compounds of this invention are in general less toxic and have a broader therapeutic window than heretofore known compounds such as tacrine and physostigmine, making them more therapeutically acceptable. The ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase was determined by the photometric method of Ellman et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. This utility is further demonstrated by the ability of these compounds to restore cholinergically deficient memory in the Dark Avoidance Assay, where they are in general active over a broader dose range than heretofore known compounds, a distinct therapeutic advantage. In this assay mice are tested for their ability to remember an unpleasant stimulus for a period of 24 hours. A mouse is placed in a chamber that contains a dark compartment a strong incandescent light drives it to the dark compartment, where an electric shock is administered through metal plates on the floor. The animal is removed from the testing apparatus and tested again, 24 hours later, for the ability to remember the electric shock. If scopolamine, an anticholinergic that is known to cause memory impairment, is administered before an animal s initial exposure to the test chamber, the animal re enters the dark compartment shortly after being placed in the test chamber 24 hours later. This effect of scopolamine is blocked by an active test compound, resulting in a greater interval before re entry into the dark compartment. The results for an active compound are expressed as the percent of a group of animals in which the effect of scopolamine is blocked, as manifested by an increased interval between being placed in the test chamber and re entering the dark compartment. Effective quantities of the compounds of the invention may be administered to a patient by any of the various methods, for example, orally as in capsules or tablets, parenterally in the form of sterile solutions or suspensions, and in some cases intravenously in the form of sterile solutions. The free base final products, while effective themselves, may be formulated and administered in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts for purposes of stability, convenience of crystallization, increased solubility and the like. Acids useful for preparing the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the invention include inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric and perchloric acids, as well as organic acids such as tartaric, citric, acetic, succinic, maleic, fumaric and oxalic acids.

For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compounds of the invention may be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers or chewing gum. These preparations should contain at least .5 of active compound, but may be varied depending upon the particular form and may conveniently be between 4 to about 7 of the weight of the unit. The amount of active compound in such compositions is such that a suitable dosage will be obtained.
