# A sitting device.

## Abstract
A sitting device 1 with a seat 4 , the inclination of which may be altered relative to a floor supporting means 5 arranged below and substantially in front of said seat for the knee or calf portions of the user. The supporting means are arranged at the front portion of the frame 2 of the device in the form of two cushions spaced apart to provide a free space accessible to the legs of the user from the front and in a direction towards the seat. The sitting device may have a back rest. The seat may be fixedly connected to the frame, and the frame provided with generally curved runners 3 to contact the floor and said supporting means arranged at the front ends of the runners. The runners may at a middle portion thereof have curved transition between front and back portions of the runners. Instead of the seat being fixedly connected with respect to the runners, the seat may be hingedly connected to the frame and be forwardly tiltable.
