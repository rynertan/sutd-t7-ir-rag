# Automatic sampling arrangement.

## Abstract
In automatic sampling arrangements for supplying liq uid samples to analytical instruments, it is convenient to have the samples in open bottles 21 in circular ranks 16, 17 in a turntable 1 indexed in rotation under a sampling mechanism 27 . It is desirable to maintain the turntable ho rizontal while being inserted into a compartment 4 con taining the sampling mechanism and a turntable drive as sembly 24 . Also, for easy operation, it is desirable that the turntable need not be registered accurately in the compart ment. The arrangement is constructed so that the turntable is inserted, via an aperture 6 into the compartment in a di rection perpendicular to its axis of rotation. The turntable is located by three bearing surfaces 29, 31 and 24 which en gage the circumference of the turntable, the driving as sembly 24 being one of the bearing surfaces and also en gaging said circumference to rotate the turntable. One of the bearing surfaces 31 is movable from a first position in which it engages said circumference to a second position clear of the aperture to allow insertion or withdrawal of the turntable.
