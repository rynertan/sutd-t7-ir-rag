# Graphic display area classification.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are provided for classifying areas on a raster type display unit. As shown, the unit has a scan video processor SVP which presents graphic data from picture element stores ST1 ST4 for display on a video monitor VM . The problem is to identify areas defined by a closed boundary e.g. for filling in such areas. Boundary data are entered, e.g. by vector generator VG , into a first polygon store PST which has a plurality of memory locations each corresponding to a respective dot position of the display field, and at least one seed point is identified. Each dot position is then examined to see whether there exists a connected path, not including a boundary position, from it to a seed point, and if there is, this fact is recorded in a second, fill store FST . The criterion for deciding whether or not a path is connected depends on the definition of what constitutes a closed boundary.
