# Loop seal assembly.

## Abstract
Reflective type insulation is utilized to elevate the temperature in the loop seal piping of a loop seal of a pressurizer. Damage to safety valve components and down stream piping caused by water in the piping is substantially reduced by exposing the loop seal piping to heat gain from a portion of the outer surface of the pressurizer. Safety valve allowable sustained operating temperature requirements are considered in the insulation system design.
