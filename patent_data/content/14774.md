## Description
APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF DATA INFORMATION The invention relates to an apparatus and a method for the transmission of management data information from fue3 stations or depots spread over a large area to a central point, where data processing takes place, all fuel stations on depots just as the central points having a normally operating telephone connection. An important example of locations spread over a sarge area s a network of service stations for road traffic in a district. Such a network may comprise many dozens of stations, which are managed and must be supplied from a central point, the district office. Many data play a role here, such as stocks of the various products, quantities delivered, distribution of customer calls over a given time, money received, etc.Such data are generally entered on lists and are very important for efficient management. It may also provide a sounder basis for the optimization of the supply. It is essential that the data should be available at a central point and this can be done by having normal telephone calls between each fuel station or depot and the central point.However, this is a very digressive way. The apparatus and method according to the invention remove these difficulties and the invention provides the means with which these data can be transmitted in an effective, inexpensive and flexible way. The invention therefore is characterized in that a switching device is present at the fuel station or depot just as at the central point, said switching device upon activation, connects said relevant fuel station or depot with the central point and data processing device by way of the telephone line, whereas a simultaneous blocking of the telephone apparatus at the central point and at the fuel station or depot exists, as long as the data processing device is linked with the fuel station or depot and in that each fuel station or depot is equipped with a memory for the temporary recording of information to be transmitted to the central point, whereas said memory is connected with a receiver at the central point through the telephone line by way of said switching device to be activated by means of an activating device related to said fuel station or depot, and in that further a signal element is present at the fuel station or depot, said element swerving to reset the switching device of the fuel station or depot after finishing reading out, and in that a signal element being present at the central point, said element before reading out acting upon said signal element at the fuel station or depot by way of the telephone line by means of a special signal, and a reset device for the switching device at tb,ecentral point after reading out also being present. Said special signal may be a signal to which the normal telephone apparatus is not sensitive. Considerable advantages are achieved with this apparatus.Use is made of existing telephone lines with which each location is equipped in any cas. During transmission of the information normal telephone services at the location concerned are not available. This is hardly a restriction, since depending on the information to be transmitted reading takes only a few seconds and at most one minute. As a rule it will be sufficient to read once every 24 hours. In addition, it is of course possible to do this out of business hours, since it can all be done automatically. When an installation is called from the central point and the telephone at the location is found to be engaged, the telephone conversation at the location is not broken, but the location s concerned is are called again after termination of one round of readings until all data have been collected.The normal telephone bell may ring when a location is called for reading, but this is not necessary.When the connection has been made, a special alarm signal is given, for instance an alternating current of a certain frequency, to which the switching device reacts. The switching device may contain a bi stable switching element, equipped with a signal identification device. Calling the locations one after the other may very conveniently be done by an automatic selector. The apparatus according to the invention is very flexible as regards its potentialities, because any normal telephone connection may be used. Only a minor operation is necessary to connect a location to the reading apparatus. The memory in the location can be fed with information in any convenient way. As a rule, a minicomputer will be used here to code the information by conversion into a series of pulses and to direct the information to the desired place in memory. Certain data which are constantly available, such as the level in the underground tanks of a service station, do not pass through the memory until the reading. Other data such as the distribution of sales over the day will obviously have to be collected and stored. The data to be registered may be conducted to the input of the memory fully automatically and by known means. Obviously, this may also be done entirely or partly by human action. At the central point the incoming information is decoded in a suitable way and processed, as a rule by a computer. An apparatus according to the invention is also very suitable for other applications, such as reading of results from widely spread test stations at drilling locations., at depots, at tank farms or for the transmission of data from, for instance, branch offices of a bank to a central point. The invention will now be further explained with the aid of a block scheme according to the attached drawing. In Fig. 1 number 1 indicates a telephone line which may connect a central point I with a location II. Telephone line 1 runs via a normal exchange, not further indicated here. Switch 2, in the normal position, connects telephone apparatus 3 with telephone line 1. The same is done by switch It with telephone apparatus 5. Switch 2 can be put in the desired positions by actuator 6. The required signals are emitted by computer 7 via line 8. When actuator 6 puts switch 2 in the position not drawn. telephone apparatus 3 is dnscon nected. Subsequently, computer 7 emits pulses via line 9 with which location II is called. This is done by emitting the pulses for the normal subscriberss number. Moreover, frequency generator tone generator 10 is switched on at the right moment. This frequency generator produces, for instance, a frequency of 1300 Hz.The connection with location II has meanwhile been made.Frequency detector tone detector 11 recognizes the emitted frequency of 1300 Hz and activates actuator 12, which puts switch It in the position not drawn. Telephone apparatus 5 is thus disconnected and telephone line 1 is connected with element 13, which contains, inter alia, a signal converter, a memory and a pulse generator. For a short time a reply frequency of for instance 2100 Hz is emitted by element 13 to the central point. Receiver lIt reacts to it by instructing computer 7 to carry out the program of data reading. These data are transmitted via receiver 14 to computer 7. By decoding and further processing the data become available in the desired form. An end of message signal from element 13 puts switch It back in the position drawn. The same happens to switch 2 with an end signal from computer 7. The normal telephone connection is now available again. Line 15 indicates the place where the data to be transmitted from the meters and other sources. not drawn here, are conducted to element 13. Broken lines 16 and 17 indicate that the parts inside these lines have been assembled in boxes, which can be connected, via the external connections shown, to parts and lines as indicated.
