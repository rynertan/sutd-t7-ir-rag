## Abstract
An optical filter member 31 composed of a plurality of ND filters 31a, 31b, 31c having different transmission factors and arranged circumferentially at regular intervals is disposed between a light source 32 and a light guide 11a of an endoscope 11 . When the optical filter member 31 is rotated, a light beam with periodically varying luminance is transmitted through the light guide 11a to illuminate a subject 35 inside a body cavity. Images of the subject corresponding to different luminances are converted sever ally into video signals by a television camera 13 . A signal component within a given level range is extracted from each of these video signals by a limiter 21 . The signal compo nents of the video signals are composed into video data to be supplied to a display 27 . The display 27 indicates the video data as an image with proper contrast.
