## Description
PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF AN OPTIMALLY ACTIVE LACTONE OF A CYCLOPROPANE CARBOXYLIC ACID The present invention relates to the manufacture of the optically active gamma lactone of lR,cis 2, 2 dimethyl 3 hydroxymethyl cyclopropane 1 carboxylic acid hereinafter referred to as optically active 1R, cis gamma lactone or optically active V lactone and more particularly to the synthesis of an optically active 6 lactone from optically active car 3 en 5 one. The optically inactive lactone or cis 2,2 dimethyl 3 hydroxy methyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid, having the formulaEMI1.1 is a known compound which may be manufactured by a multi step process. It is a well known intermediate for the manufacture of optically inactive methyl cis 2,2 dimethyl 3 formyl cyclopropane carboxylate of the formula II below, itself a valuable intermediate for the synthesis of optically inactive cis chrysanthemic acid of the formula III below see A Krief et al Tet. Lett 3915 1976 , and the pyrethroid acid of formula IV below, see J. Martel et al, DOS 2827627 1979 , Roussel Uclaf.EMI1.2 X CH3 or H X Cl or Br and R H The aforesaid optically active y lactone is also convenient starting material for the manufacture of optically active 1R, cis pyrethroid acid of formulaIV which can be converted in an to an optically active 1Rcis synthetic pyrethroid having the formula III above, where X C1 andEMI2.1 or X C1 or Br andThe above optically active 1R, cis synthetic pyrethroids possess more insecticidal activity than the corresponding optically inactive compounds. The present invention provides a process for producing the said optically active gamma lactone which is short and commercially convenient. The new process avoids the use of a hazardous ozonoiysis reaction as in prior art processes for the manufacture from 3 carene of various intermediates useful for the manufacture of pyrethroid insecticides. The process of the present invention for the manufacture of optically active lactone of 1R, cis 2,2 dimethyl 3 hydroxymethyl cyclopropane 1 carboxylic acid comprises oxidising optically active car 3 en 5one of formula EMI2.2 to form optically active lR, cis 2,2 dimethyl 3 2 oxopropyl cyclopropane l carboxylic acid of formula EMI2.3 oxidising the said compound of formula VI to form IR, R cis 2,2 dimeEhyl 3 acetoxymethyl cyclopropane l carboxylic acid of formula EMI2.4 and hydrolysing the compound of formula VII to form the optically active lactone. The compound of formula V may be obtained by known methods, such as oxidation of 3 carene formula of the formulaEMI3.1 with air in the presence of a catalyst as described inU.S. Patent 4,393,244. The invention, thus, also provides a short process for the manufacture from 3 carene of the optically active compound of formula .VI which in the prior art has been manufactured by multi step processes, see Matsui et al, Agric. Biol. Chem. Jap. 21, 784 1965 R. B. Mitra et al ind. J. Chew. 208 436 1981 VI , W. Cocker et al, J.C.S. Perkin I, 332 1975 . The first oxidation reaction to make the intermediate compound of formula VI may be conducted in the liquid phase, at ambient temperature, using known oxidants, such as potassium permanganate, mixture of potassium permanganate chromic acid, potassium permanganate potassium dichromate or sodium dichromate , potassium permanganate sodium periodate and the like, in solvents such as water, acetone acetic acid water, or acetic acid water mixture. The compound of formula VI is oxidised to the carboxylate derivative, preferably the acetate derivative of the formula VII with known oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide, per acids such as m chloroperbenzoic acid, perbenzoic acid, perphthalic acid, peracetic acid and the like in suitable chlorinated solvents such as methylene chloride, chloroform or acetic acid at room temperature. Hydrolysis of the carboxylate of the formula viz to the said optically active lactone of formula I is conducted preferably in the same reaction zone or vessel as the said oxidation with per acids, preferably under acidic condition using aqueous inorganic acids such as sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid or the like, in polarsolvents such as methanol, ethanol, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, acetic acid or the like. The invention is illustrated by the followingExamples.

Example 2 lactone of 1R cis dimethyl 3 hydroxymethyl cyclspropane l carboxvlic acid To a solution of the product from Example 1 5.1 g, 0.03 mole in dichloromethane 10 ml was added with stirring at ambient temperature a solution of 85 m chloroperbenzoic acid 7.2 g, 0.036 mole in dichloromethane 20 ml . The reaction mixture was stirred for 72 h. The precipitated m chlorobenzoic acid was filtered off.
