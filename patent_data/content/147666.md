# Method of converting a precursor ceramic solid into a solid ceramic hydronium conductor.

## Abstract
A method of converting a feed solid polycrystalline of beta alumina into a hydronium conductor requires the preselection of an appropriate feed ceramic preferably with a chemical forumula Na0.6K0.4 2O 3 w o MgO beta beta sec Al2O3 and with a f beta of 0.37 0.03 wherein CHEM The crystallographic lattice is altered by placing the solid feed ceramic in an ionic solution or melt containing two or more ionic species of different ionic radii the composition of the melt or solution being written M1, M2 M3... X where M1 and M2 and M3 etc. are ions of dissimilar size and as examples sodium, potassium, lithium and hydronium ions. After a time the material is removed, washed and subjected to a field effect exchange whereby the desired hydronium conducting solid ceramic having the following chemical composition is achieved H3O _a Na _b K _c 2O Z beta beta sec Al2O3 where a b c 0 l and a b c l and Z is a stabilizer of the beta sec phase.
