# A FOAM COMPOSITION AND USE THEREOF

## Abstract
A method of producing a phenolic foam composition comprises reacting A an aqueous solution of a reactive phenolic resin having 65 85 wt. solid solution B a foaming agent and C a reactive acid hardener wherein the ratio of component A to component B is from 4.5 1 to 9.3 1 and the ratio of component A to component C is from 6.5 1 to 7.5 1. The phenolic foam composition which has excellent fire resistance and very low thermal conductivity is useful in the manufacture of wall or ceiling boards for use in the building industry.
