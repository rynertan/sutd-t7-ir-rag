# AROMATIC AMINO ACID PRODUCING MICROORGANISMS

## Abstract
An isolated microbial gene that specifies the biosynthesis of a 3 deoxy 2 keto D arabinoheptulosonic acid 7 phosphate DAHP synthetase, which is resistant to feedback inhibition by aromatic amino acids plasmids containing such a gene and microorganisms transformed thereby.
