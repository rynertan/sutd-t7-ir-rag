## Description
STYRENIC POLYMER FOAMS HAVING IMPROVED FLAMMABILITY CHkRACTERISTICS AND METHOD FOR PREPARING SkNE This invention relates to styrenic polymer foams having improved flammability characteristics and to a method for preparing same. Extruded foams of styrenic polymers are known and are highly desirable for many applications such as thermal insulation, packaging and the like. In such applications, it is generally desirable that the styrenic polymer foams exhibit the best practicable flammability characteristics i.e., the lowest practicable propensity to ignite and or to support combustion once ignited . A number of prior art approaches for improving the flammability characteristics of styrenic polymer foams have been suggested. One approach for improving flammability characteristics involves the incorporation of relatively large quantities of a halogen containing compound into the foam as a flame retardant component.Alternatively, the incorporation of a combination of a relatively smaller amount of the halogen containing compound with an organic peroxide compound or, in combination with iron naphthenate, a chlorine compound e.g., chlorinated paraffin in an amount sufficient to provide at least 2 percent by weight of chlorine content based upon the polymer composition have been proposed to improve flammability characteristics. See, for example, U.S. Patent 3,595,815 .Unfortunately, such prior art approaches toward improved flammability characteristics can introduce troublesome processing problems and or detrimentally affect one or more other important styrenic polymer foam properties such as decreasing ultraviolet stability decreasing polymer stability and thus increasing degradation and decreasing foam strength increasing brittleness discoloring the foam decreasing heat distortion temperature, etc. In view of the foregoing, it would be highly desirable to provide a styrenic polymer foam having improved flammability characteristics and a method for preparing these foams while at the same time minimizing or at least significantly reducing the aforementioned attendant disadvantages of the various prior art approaches. Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention is a styrenic polymer foam having improved flammability characteristics. The styrenic polymer foam is characterized by the presence of at least one non waxy flame retarding agent and from 0.03 to less than 2 weight percent of a waxy material having a melting point of less than 1400C, which waxy material, in the specific amount employed, imparts improved flammability characteristics to the styrenic polymer foam without significantly increasing the cell size of the foam during foam preparation. In another aspect, the present invention is a method for preparing a styrenic polymer foam having improved flammability characteristics.The method is of the type wherein a heat plastified styrenic polymer gel containing at least one volatile fluid foaming agent and at least one non waxy flame retarding agent is expressed from a die into a region of reduced pressure, the expressed gel expands into cellular form and is cooled to a temperature at which the expanded cellular gel is self supporting. The method is characterized by the incorporation into the heat plastified unfoamed gel of from 0.03 to less than 2 weight percent, based upon the styrenic polymer weight, of a waxy material which has a melting point below about 1400C and which imparts improved flammability characteristics to the resulting styrenic polymer foam without significantly increasing the cell size thereof. As used herein, reference to improving the flammability characteristics , improved flammability characteristics , flame retardant and like phrases is meant to connote a measurably reduced propensity of a foam sample to ignite or a reduced propensity of such foam sample to sustain combustion if ignited when exposed to a small scale ignition source such as a Bunsen burner and, of course, such reduced propensity is propensity measured relative to that of a sample of foam comparable to that tested except for the absence therefrom of the aforementioned waxy material component of the present invention. Naturally, with regard to the foregoing flammability criterion, it must be recognized that all known synthetic hydrocarbon polymers will burn when subjected to a sufficiently intense source of heat.Accordingly, the small scale ignition tests employed herein may not reflect the properties of the polymer foams hereunder under actual fire conditions. Styrenic polymers suitable for use in the practice of the present invention include styrene or substituted styrene homopolymers e.g., polystyrene, poly vinyl toluene , etc. copolymers of styrene and a substituted styrene and copolymers of styrene or a substituted styrene with one or more comonomers polymerizable therewith e.g., acrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate, acrylic acid etc. . Preferred styrenic polymers for use herein include polystyrene and copolymers of a major proportion e.g., 75 weight percent or more of styrene with a minor proportion e.g., up to about 25 weight percent of one or more other monomers polymerizable therewith. Waxy materials suitable for use in the practice of the present invention include both natural and synthetic waxes including both the halogenated, e.g., chlorinated, and non halogenated versions thereof or mixtures thereof which improves the flowability of the styrenic polymer melt under combustion conditions. For this purpose, the wax employed can have a melting point above or below the foaming temperature of the styrenic polymer composition employed. However, inasmuch as the use of from about 0.01 to 5 weight parts per 100 weight parts of polymer of waxes melting below the foaming temperature for purposes of enlarging the cell size of the foam prepared from various polymeric materials is disclosed by K.W. Suh and C. Amos inU.S.Patent No. 4,229,396, the focus of the present invention is directed to those waxy materials or mixtures of waxy materials which impart improved flammability characteristics without significantly enlarging the cell size of the resultant styrenic polymer foams. A limited number of waxy materials specifically, several waxy halogenated compounds such as various chlorinated paraffins, e.g.,Chlorowax 70S which melts at a temperature of about 750C which melt below the foaming temperature employed in the preparation of most styrenic polymer foams exhibit these properties. In this regard, the waxy halogenated material is presumed to improve the flammability characteristics of the foam when the propensity of the foam to ignite is reduced more than that expected due to the mere increase in the halogen content of the foam composition by the addition of the waxy halogenated material. More typically, the waxy materials or mixtures employed herein are those waxy materials which melt at or above the foaming temperature of the styrenic polymer composition employed.Accordingly, inasmuch as foamable styrenic polymer compositions are generally foamed in the range from 1150C to 125 C, the waxy materials envisioned for use in the present invention are those having a melting point of at least 1150C, Preferably such waxy materials have a melting point of from 1150C to 1400C, Representative of waxes having a melting point within this temperature range include Polywax 2000, Polywax 1000,Polywax E 2020, Estawax 20, Estawax 25, Cardipol 0 10, Cardipol 0 20, Cincinnati Millacron 240, Halscarbon Wax 12 00, Santowax P, CasawaxC103, Casawax A93 G, Casawax A93 B, Halowax 1013, Petrolite C 403, Ralowax 1014, Abril lODS and mixtures of two or more waxes which individual waxes may or may not melt within the specified temperature range which wax mixture melts within the specified temperature range. The aforementioned waxy materials or mixture of waxy materials are employed in the practice of the present invention in an amount of from 0.03 to less than 2 weight percent based upon the weight of the styrenic polymer with the use of larger amounts thereof being generally undesirable due to attendant disadvantageous impact upon the heat distortion temperature of the resultant styrenic polymer foam.Preferably such waxy material is employed in an amount ranging from 0.05 to 2.0 weight percent based upon the weight of the styrenic polymer employed. An especially preferred range is from 0.1 to 1.5 with a most preferred range being from 0.1 to 1.0, weight percent based upon the weight of styrenic polymer employed. The non waxy flame retarding agents suitably employed in thepresent invention include non waxy flame retarding agents conventionally employed in styrenic polymer foams such as the non waxy halogenated flame retarding agents e.g., monochloropentabromocyclohexane, tetra bromobutane, dibromoethylbenzene, dibromopropanol, hexachloro cyclopentadiene, hexabromocyclododecane and the like . Preferred flame retarding agents are hexabromcyclododecane and monochloropentabromocyclohexane.The flame retarding agent is employed in the normal amounts e.g., from 0.5 to 10, preferably from 0.5 to 5, weight percent based upon the weight of the styrenic polymer employed . Naturally, since the indicated conventional flame retarding component employed herein is required to be a non waxy substance, it will be readily recognized that halogenated waxes such as chlorinated paraffins are not the sort of materials to be employed as that particular component of the present invention. Accordingly, it will be similarly apparent that this non waxy flame retarding component will always be different than the waxy component employed herein. The styrenic polymer foams of the present invention can be prepared by an extrusion foaming process or by a suspension process for making expandable styrenic polymer beads. The advantages of the present invention are particularly evident, as compared to the use of peroxide materials to improve the flammability characteristics of the styrenic polymer foams in extrusion foaming processes. Specifically, the waxy materials described herein are suitably employed in extrusion foaming processes whereas most organic free radical initiators decompose under extrusion conditions employed in the preparation of many styrenic polymer foams and can not therefore be suitably employed in that process. In the extrusion foaming process, a heat plastified styrenic polymer gel containing a volatile fluid foaming agent, at least one flame retarding agent and from 0.03 to 2 weight percent based on polymer weight of the hereinabove described waxy material is expressed from a die into a region of reduced pressure such that the expressed gel expands into cellular form. The resulting expressed product is cooled to a temperature at which the expanded cellular gel is self supporting. In the practice of the present invention, any volatile fluid blowing or expanding agents capable of forming the desired cellular foam can be employed as the volatile fluid foaming agent. The individual ingredients comprising the foamable composition can be combined in any convenient fashion. For example, the waxy material, optionally, as a mixture with the retarding agent or other adjuncts employed in the preparation of the foam and preferably in the form of a concentrate of the waxy material in a styrenic polymer may be mixed with the heat plastified gel or blended with the granular resinous styrenic polymer prior to being heat plastified in the extruder. The waxy material may be added to the polymer before or after the addition of the volatile fluid foaming agent, either before or after the resinous material has been heat plastified.Alternatively, in a process wherein the volatile fluid foaming agent is being added to a heat plastified gel within an extruder, the waxy material can be conveniently admixed with the blowing agent and both components added to the extruder simultaneously. The improved flammability characteristics of the styrenic polymer foams of the present invention are exhibited by the following example.The example is meant to illustrate, but not limit, the invention.EXAMPLE Various styrenic polymer foams Sample Nos. 1 7 are prepared from mixtures consisting of polystyrene, barium stearate about 0.075 weight percent based on the weight of the polystyrene polymer , magnesium oxide about 0.015 to 0.03 weight percent based upon the weight of the polystyrene polymer , flame retarding agent monochloropentabromocyclo hexane and wax, in the form of a 5 percent polymer concentrate, as specified in the accompanying Tables I, II and III by feeding the mixture to an extruder and melting the mixture at a temperature of 2000C and a pressure of from 1500 to 2000 pounds per square inch.The blowing agent employed is a blend of equal weight parts of methyl chloride and dichlorodifluormethane. It is introduced into the polymer melt in the melting section of. the extruder and the resulting mixture is thoroughly mixed and then cooled to the foaming temperature 1150 to 1250C . The mixture is then extruded through a slit die at about 400 600 pounds per square inch and expanded between a pair of substantially parallel plates to form the foam into a rectangular cross section. Styrenic polymer foams Comparative Samples A C are prepared using identical techniques except that no waxy material was incorporated within the foamable mixtures. The flammability characteristics of the resulting samples are evaluated by holding, at horizontal position, test pieces 1 4 inch thick, 1 inch wide and 6 inches long in the flame of a horizontally positioned micro burner for 1.5 seconds1 removing the burner and noting the time for the sample to extinguish. In such flammability testing, 6 test pieces are cut from each sample and average extinguishment times are reported in Table 1.

However, this amount of the C 400 wax increases the cell size of the resulting foam. Therefore, it is not an example of the present invention since the present invention contemplates using only waxes and amounts of said waxes sufficient to improve flammability characteristics without increasing cell size of the foam.

The samples of Table III were additionally checked for flammability with a slightly different test method which generally corresponded to the test known as the French Flame Persistency Test CSTB . Three bar shaped test pieces were cut from each sample board tested. The three specimens measured about 8 to 10 inches in the direction horizontal to extrusion, 35 mm in the extruded direction and 30 mm in the direction vertical to extrusion. The flame of a propane butane bunsen burner, leaning diagonally at a 450 angle toward the end of the horizontally positioned specimen, was held in contact with the end of the specimen for 5 seconds following the retreating end as it melted and burned away. After 5 seconds the flame was removed and the time required for the burning specimen to extinguish was then recorded.This procedure, termed an attack was repeated until the specimen was consumed, usually about 6 to 8 attacks. The average extinguishment time for all the attacks on all of the three specimens is shown for each sample in Table III, labeled CSTB Time. The results of this CSTB testing are summarized in Table III below.
