# Method and apparatus for producing finished foam plastic containers.

## Abstract
The present invention is directed to an improved appara tus and method for manufacturing completed foam plastic containers. An endless mandrel chain 46 carries cup forming mandrels FM along a manufacturing path. After each mandrel is preheated, a bottom blank BD is placed on the mandrel bottom and held there by a vacuum. A cylindrical blank 10C formed from longitudinally stretch oriented foam sheet mate rial is then placed onto the mandrel. This cylindrical blank 10C is tightly tamped onto the mandrel FM and is clamped in place. Radiant heat is then used to shrink form a finished con tainer. The bottom is then sealed to the cylindrical blank and the mandrel is transferred to a curling assembly TCT where the top edge portion of each finished container is lubricated and then curled to form a finished rim. The apparatus of the present invention may form containers having a dual tapered configuration which allows the containers to be more tightly stacked.
