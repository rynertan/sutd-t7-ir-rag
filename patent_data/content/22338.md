# Forming machine including rotary drive mechanism.

## Abstract
A forming machine 10 is disclosed as including a rotary drive mechanism 30 that provides accurate control of the degree to which forming is performed. The drive mechanism 30 includes a pair of drive members 34 mounted for movement with a pair of elongated dies that are preferably embodied as die racks 22, 24 mounted on lower and upper bases 12, 14 of the machine 10 . A toothed drive gear 32 is meshed with drive teeth 52 on each of the drive members 34 and is rotatably driven by a drive spindle to thereby move the drive members 34 and hence the dies 22, 24 in order to form a workpiece mounted between the dies 22, 24 . The drive mechanism 30 has particular utility in a machine for forming a thin walled annular sleeve of a workpiece mounted on a toothed mandrel 38 between the dies 22, 24 . An automatic loader 40 is preferably utilized to mount the workpiece on the mandrel 38 such that movement of the dies 22, 24 engages the die and mandrel teeth 124 with the workpiece sleeve therebetween in order to provide the forming.
