These and other objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the description of the invention which follows and from the claims.DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The alkoxylated tertiary amine compounds prepared by the process of the present invention have the general formula EMI3.1 wherein R is a straight or branched chain alkyl group having from 1 to 11, preferably from 6 to 10 carbon atoms, a cyclic alkyl group having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably from 5 to 6 carbon atoms, an aryl group having up to 12 carbon atoms, preferably 6 to 10 carbon atoms, or an aralkyl or alkaryl group having up to 18 carbon atoms, preferably 7 to 12 carbon atoms, R1 is a single unit or a series of units of the formula EMI3.2 wherein in each unit R5 is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and a straight or branched chain alkyl group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and x is an integerof from 0 to 40, preferably from 3 to 20, R2 is hydrogen or a straight or branched chain alkyl group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and R3 and R4 are each independently selected from the group consisting of straight and branched chain alkyl groups having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 8 carbon atoms, cyclic alkyl groups having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably 5 to 6, 1 to 4 carbon atom alkyl substituted or unsubstituted benzyl groups and allyl. The alkoxylated tertiary amine compounds are prepared by reacting an alcohol or mixtures of alcohols with an alkylene oxide to prepare an oxyalkylated alcohol followed by catalytic amination of the oxyalkylated alcoho with a secondary amine such as a dialkyl, dicyclic alkyl, dibenzyl or diallyl amine under increased temperatures and pressure. The oxyalkylation reaction is conducted by methods well known in the art by reacting an appropriate alcohol such as, for example, methanol, etc. or the short chain plasticizer range linear Ziegler type alcohols containing various mixtures of C6 through C10 alcohols with an alkylen oxide, such as propylene oxide in the presence of an alkali metal or alkaline earth catalyst as taught, for example in the U. S. Patent Nos. 2,508,035 2,617,830 2,671,115 and 3,382,285 and incorporated herein by reference. Typical of such Ziegler alcohols, which are also employed in the instant invention, are the SEPAL 810 or 610 and ALFOL 810 or 610 types which are mixtures of predominately C8 andC10 straight chain alcohols sold commercially, for example, by the Ethyl Corporation and the Continental Oil Company respectively. The alcohols which may be reacted with the alkylene oxides .to prepare the oxyalkylated alcohols for further processing include any aliphatic or branched monohydric alcohol containing from 1 to 11 carbon atoms, cyclic alcohols, aryl alcohols as well as aralkyl and alkaryl alcohols as defined by R in the above formula. Representative alcohols include, for example, methyl, ethyl, n iso sec and tert butyl, amyl, hexyl, octyl, nonyl, n and isopropyl, decyl, and benzyl alcohols, cyclohexanol, 2ethyl hexanol, methyl cyclohexanol, 3 methyl butanol, 1heptanol and the like or mixtures thereof. The alkylene oxides which may be employed to prepare the oxyalkylated alcohols include, for example, ethylene and propylene oxide and the higher alkylene oxides, i.e., containing from 3 to 12 carbon atoms. Preferred among the oxides is propylene oxide. Illustrative higher alkylene oxides include, for example, isobutylene oxide, 1,2 epoxybutane, 2,3 epoxybutane, 2,3 dimethyl 2,3 epoxybutane, 2 methyl 2,3 epoxypentane, 1,2 epoxypentane, 5methyl 1,2 epoxyheptane, 1,2 epoxyoctane, 2,4,4 trimethyl 1, 2 epoxypentane, 2,4, 4 trimethyl 2,3 epoxypentane, 1,2 epoxynonane, 1,2 epoxydecane, 1,2 epoxydodecane, 3 ethoxy 4propyl 3,4 epoxyheptane, and the like or mixtures thereof. In general, the oxyalkylated alcohol formation with, for example propylene oxide, is carried out at temperatures in the range of from about 700C to 1500C preferably 90 C to 1000C under moderately elevated pressures of from about atmospheric to 500 psig, preferably from 50 to 100 psig, and in the presence of between about 0.01 to 1, preferably 0.2 to 0.3 weight of total reactants of an alkalinereacting material or catalyst such as sodium, potassium, calcium, barium and strontium hydroxides.In general a controlled amount of an alkylene, oxide or admixture thereon is slowly contacted with the alcohol reactant for a period ranging up to about 20 hours in an amount sufficient to prepare the desired oxyalkylated reaction product mixtureOn completion of the oxyalkylation reaction, the crude reaction product containing the catalyst is normally treat with an inorganic acid or acid fqrming material to neutral the reaction product after which itisfiltered to produce a finished oxyalkylated product. If desired the oxyalkylation of the alcohol may be carried out in the presence of a suitable inert solvent such as toluene, benzene, xylene, tetrahydrofuran, heptane, hexane, pentane, octane, etc. which are free of water. Preparation of the alkoxylated tertiary amine involves the novel process of aminating the oxyalkylated alcohol with a secondary amine in the presence of from about 0.5 to 20 weight 8, preferably 2.5 to 10 weight of amination catalyst based on the total reaction mixture.Any amination catalyst known in the art may be employed, such as, for example, Raney Nickel, supported noble metals, and catalysts containing Cu, Cr and promoters such as nickel however, catalysts containing CuO and Cur203 in various ratios, Cu Cr supported on magnesium aluminate spinel and ruthenium on activated carbon are preferred catalysts. The secondary amines which may be used to aminate the oxyalkylated alcohol include, for example, dimethylamine, diethylamine, di n propylamine, di ipropylamine, di n butylaruine, di n amylamine, di n hexylamine, di n octylamine, di nonylamine, di n decylamine, di i octylamine, di benzylamine, dimethylbenzylamine, diethylbenzylamine, dicyclohexylamine, dicyclopentylamine, and diallylamine. The amination reaction of oxyalkylated alcohols employing secondary amines iS conducted at a temperature withir the range of from about 1500C to 3250C with a preferred range being from 1750C to 2750C. The pressure may be varied from about 50 psig to 30000 psig with the preferred range being 100 psig to 250 psig. Although not required, solvents, if desired, which are chemically inert to the components of the reacting system may be employed in the reductive amination reaction.Suitable solvents include, for example, heptane, pentane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene, etc. The reaction time is generally dependent upon the oxyalkylated alcohol and secondary amine being reacted, temperature and pressure and on the amount of catalyst employed as well as the type of equipment being employed.Reaction times will vary dependent on whether the process is continuous, semi continuous or batch.

A wide variety of alkoxylated amines can be prepared by the process of this invention. The following Examples are provided to illustrate the process of the present invention in accordance with th principles of this invention, but are not to be construed as limiting the invention in any way except as indicated by the appended claims. EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of Oxyalkylated Alcohols General All oxyalkylation reactions were carried out in a 2 gallon stirred stainless steel autoclave. A 0.25 percent catalyst solution was prepared using the desired alcohol admixture and potassium hydroxide by preheating at 75 100eC. Water was removed under vacuum and the catalyst solution was charged hot under dry nitrogen into the autoclave. The remaining alcohol was added to the reactor followed by a purge with dry nitrogen. The react was heated to 95 C and dry alkylene oxide in the appropri stoichiometry was slowly added over a period of from 24 t 48 hours using a pressure demand control valve system to control the addition rate.A reference pressure was set at 60 psig and if the reactor pressure dropped below the reference pressure the control valve opened and more alkylene oxide was charged to the reactor. When the pressure increased to greater than 60 psig, the valve closed. The alkylene oxide was contained in a hoke that was suspended on a weight load cell, thereby permitting the charging of the correct amount of alkylene oxide. Since the hoke had an 80 psig nitrogen pressure head, the overall reactor pressure increased to 80 psig when all the liquid alkylene oxide was pushed out of the load cell hoke into the reactor.When the reaction was complete the product was removed hot from the reactor and was treated with magnesium silicate 4 grams per 250 grams of product for 2 hours at 120iC in order to remove the catalyst. The resulting product was vacuum filtered through a bed of diatomaceous earth at 60800C to provide the pure oligomeric polyol. Hydroxyl number,VPO molecular weight, GPC analyses and 13C NMR were employed to determine and characterize the product oligomers. In general, for the C6 C10 plasticizer range alcohols and other short chain alcohols, sufficient alkylene oxide is employed in the oxyalkylation reaction to effect preparation of an oxyalkylated derivative admixture, having an average number of alkylene oxide units per molecule in the product of between 3 and 40, preferably between 5 and 20. EXAMPLE 2 Amination Catalyst Preparation One of the catalysts used to prepare the alkoxylated tertiary amines of the invention employed magnesium aluminate spinel as a base support material. The catalyst was composed of a magnesium aluminate spinel containing 2025 weight based on the weight of the catalyst of copper oxide CuO and 1.0 2.0 weight , based on the total weight of the catalyst, of chromium trioxide cur203 , which typically was prepared by dissolving 337.5 gram of aluminum nitrate Al NO3 3.9H20 in 800 ml. of water at ambient temperature and pressure and dissolving 115.1 grams of magnesium nitrate Mg NO3 2.6H20 in 800 ml. of water.The two solutions were combined with stirring and then slowly added to 500 ml of water in a sitrred mixing tank while adding 1.35 liters of concentrated ammonium hydroxide to the mixing tank at a rate sufficient to maintain a pH of 10.0 to 12.0. The resulting precipitate was filtered followed by washing with 1 liter of distilled water in 500 ml intervals. The wet cake of catalyst was dried at 1200C and sieved to 10 mesh followed by calcination overnight at 5000C. The calcinated base material was impregnated with 32.8 mls of an aqueous solution containing copper nitrate equivalent to 11.4 grams copper oxide and chromium nitrate equivalent to .52 grams of chromite trioxide.The impregnated catalyst was dried at 1200C and calcined in air for one 1 hour at 400 C. The resulting catalyst contained 22 weight copper oxide and 1 weight chromium trioxide on the magnesium aluminate spinel base support. EXAMPLE 3 Amination of Alkoxylated Alcohols 100 CC. of the catalyst prepared according toExample 2 was packed into a 36 by 1 stainless steel fixed bed reactor. The catalyst was prereduced with hydrogen at 2500C prior to use in the amination reaction. Evolution of water from the reaction was used to follow the amination process. Hydrogen, dialkylamine, and alkoxylated oligomer alcohol were fed to the reactor at a 5 2 1 molar ratio using .75 2.0 hourly space velocity at a 2250C reaction temperature. The gases leaving the reactor were passed through a heated transfer line to a separator to disengage the alkoxylated tertiary amine product. 13C NMR of a typical reaction mixture, which utilized the SEPAL 810 C8 C10 POi8OH alkoxylated oligomer alcohol in the feed indicated a 95 conversion.Selectivity to the alkoxylated tertiary amine was 95 , other by products were 4 alkoxylated secondary amine EPAL C8 C10 0 PO18N CH3 H and 1 alkoxylated primary amine EPALz C8 C10 0 PO38 NH2. EXAMPLES 4 38 In Examples 4 38 which follow in table form, the batch reaction amination procedure of Example 3 was repeated using various oxyalkylated alcohols and secondary amine reactants. The reactions were carried out in a stirred 300 CC stainless steel autoclave for a period of from 4 to 8 hours under a continuous hydrogen flow of from 300 to 600 ml min. The oxyalkylated oligomers .20 moles were charged to the reactor followed by heating to the reaction temperature indicated under a continuous flow of hydrogen. The secondary amine feed was initiated, once temperature was obtained, at a rate of .23 moles hour.In Examples 4 to 26 and Examples 33 to 38, 5 weight percent of a catalyst of 80 CuO and 20 Cr203 was employed.Examples 27 and 28 employed 2.5 wt. and 10 wt. of the same catalyst respectively. Example 29 used 5 wt. of a catalyst of 70 CuO and 30 Cr203. Example 30 used 5 wt. of a catalyst of 60 CuO and 40 Cr203. Example 31 used 5 wt. of copper chromite supported on magnesium aluminate spinel and in Example 32 a catalyst of 10 ruthenium on activated carbon was employed. The products were analyzed by NMR and titration methods to determine conversion and t selectivity to the alkoxylated tertiary amine and byproduct primary and secondary amines. The reaction conditions and reactants according to the following equation are set forth in Table 1.EMI12.1 wherein R, R1, R2, R3, R4 and x are as above described.The results of the reactions showing conversion and selectivity are summarized in Table 2.
