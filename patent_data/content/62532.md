# Process for the production of discontinuous cellulose fibers coated with plasticized vinyl chloride polymer.

## Abstract
The process comprises slurrying discontinuous cellu lose fibers in water, contacting the fibers with a mixture of an aqueous dispersion of a vinyl chloride polymer and a plasticizer, causing the mixture to deposit on the fibers so as to coat the fibers, and drying the fibers. The non aqueous portion of the mixture is present in an amount of at least 25 parts per 100 parts of fibers by weight, and the weight ratio of plasticizer to vinyl chloride polymer in the mixture is from 2 1 to 25 1. The discontinuous fibers thus treated can be dispersed into a matrix comprising plasticized vinyl chloride polymer with a minimum of mixing, and the improved com posites thus produced contain a minimum of clumps of undispersed fibers.
