# Radio paging system capable of transmitting common information and receiver therefor.

## Abstract
The radio paging system comprises an encoder 33 pro ducing after a first code a string of address code and message code which follows the address code, and producing a string of information codes after a second code a transmitter 4 for transmitting a string of codes produced by the encoder 33 and a paging receiver 5 with a display for receiving the transmitted codes, upon detection of the first code, producing an alert and displaying the message codes only when the address signal which follows the first code is identical with a particular address code and, upon detection of the second code, displaying the information codes which follow the second code. This radio paging system offers an information service without lowering the channel utilization efficiency despite the use of POCSAG code.
