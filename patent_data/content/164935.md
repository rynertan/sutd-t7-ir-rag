# A pneumatic control assembly for a pneumatic cylinder.

## Abstract
A pneumatic control assembly for a pneumatic cylinder having cylinder ports at the opposite ends thereof wherein the control assembly includes a valve body clamped directly to the pneumatic cylinder by a stud extending completely through the valve body and threadedly engaging the bore in the cylinder to provide the only means for maintaining the valve body attached to the pneumatic cylinder. An identical stud extends through an adapter to engage the other port in the cylinder and a pilot body is connected to the valve body by screws and includes electrically actuated solenoids for conducting pilot pressure to the valve body for allowing the full pressure to enter and exhaust from the respective ports in the cylinder to move the piston therein back and forth. The valve body has two coupling ports extending completely therethrough for receiving the mounting stud in either position to vary the position at which the valve body may be attached to the cylinder with a sealing plug disposed in the other coupling port whereby the entire assembly may be attached to various different cylinders of different lengths with only the stud members extending into threaded en gagement with the cylinder ports.
