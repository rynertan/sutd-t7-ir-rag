## Description
Sealing ringThe invention relates to a sealing ring adapted to seal off a space between two pipes installed concentrically about each other, the front face of said ring comprising an open recess designed to form two legs of a joining body in a C shaped cross sectional surface of the ring, such as is disclosed in Netherlands patent application 6503163.The legs of the cross sectional C shaped section in this known sealing ring which may consist of plastics, are in an unstressed condition of the ring positioned slightly diverging from each other. After the instalment of the ring said legs will adjoin an inner pipe and an outer pipe in a tensioned condition, so that the space between the concentric pipes is sealed off and a penetration of moisture is prevented. As this known sealing ring is also used as a spacer means its material shoud have form stabilized properties.It is further desired that the material of the sealing ring be flexible, so as to ensure a good seal against the penetration of moisture into the space between the concentric pipes so that the insulating properties of thermic insulating material situated in said space are maintained. It is, however, a disadvantage of sealing rings of flexible, easily deformable material, that their instalment is rather difficult, whilst the functional properties of the spacer means between the two pipes are considerably reduced.It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel sealing which possesses excellent sealing properties and is yet easily to be mounted, whilst in addition a certain form stability can be obtained so that the sealing ring can also be used as a spacer means.This is attain d according to the invention with a sealing ring of the kind as described hereinbefore, which is characterized in that said ring is a sleeve of a flexible resilient material, a formstabilized ring fitting in the recess, the legs adjoining the latter after the sleeve has been installed.The advart ge of this feature is that both the sealing ring and the form stabilized ring can be easily mounted upon the inner pipe and subsequently be pressed further into the space between the inner pipe and the outer pipe by performing an axial pressure upon the forr. stabil zed ring, the use of the latter causing the concentric configuration of the sealing ring of flexible resilient material with respect to the pipes, to be maintained.The invention also relates to a pipe assembly provided with a sealing ring according to he invention.The present invention is illustrated with the aid of the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 is an axial section through the ends of two pipes installed concentrically about each other, the space between said pipes being provided with thermic insulating material, and a sealing ring according to the invention Figure 1 is half an axial section of two concentric pipes, with a section of he sealing ring of fig. t prior to an instalrsent between the pipes, and Figure 3 is a similar section as fig. 2, the sealing ring, however, bein shown in a modified embodiment.In insulated pipes, for example for conveying hot water, a fluid pipe 1 is used with a concentric tubular casing 2. The space between the pipe 1 and casing 2 is filled with a thermic insulating material 3. To prevent moisture to arrive at the insulating material from the ends of the pipes e.g. at couplings or other joining means, a sealing ring is used in the form of a sleeve 4. One front face of the sealing ring or sleeve 4 comprises an open recess designed to form two legs 6a and 6b of a joining body in a C shaped crosssectional surface of the ring which is a sleeve of flexible resilient material cooperating with a form stabilized ring 5 fitting in said recess, the legs 6a and 6b adjoining the latter when the sleeve has been mounted depicted in the cross section of fig. 1 .As is evident from the latter figure at the sides not facing the recess, legs 6a and 6b comprise protruding tongues 7 which form circumferential ribs at the inner and outer circumference of the ring.From figs. 2 and 3 it appears that legs 6a and 6b converge towards their joining body in case of an unstressed position of sleeve 4.In fig. 2 the joining body between the two legs 6a and 6b has a curved shape, while the form stabilized ring 5 comprises a curved front surface adapted to the curved shape of the joining body facing the recess.In a modified embodiment at least one of the legs 6a and 6b comprises a tongue 10, directed towards the other leg at the recess at distance from the joining body, said tongue forming a circumferental rib and fitting across a frort surface of the form stabilized ring 5 situated in the recess. Fig. 3 shows a tongue 10 installed at both legs 6a and 6b. In this embodiment the ends of the legs 6a and 6b extend tapering and form diverging end parts of the sleeve as also shown in fig. 1.Installing the sealing ring according to the invention proceeds as follows. The recess of the sleeve 4 is provided with a formstabilized ring 5 and this assembly is slid upon the projecting outer circumference 8 of the inner pipe or fluid pipe 1, leg 6a then adjoining the inner circumference of the form stabilized ring 5.Subsequently, the pressing procedure of the assembly of sleeve 4 and ring 5 is continued until leg 6b contacts the inner circumference 9 of the tubular casing 2. Leg 6b then adjoins the outer circumference of the form stabilized ring 5. The installed position is shown in fig. 1. If necessary, the instalment of the sleeve with the formstabilized ring in said space between the fluid pipe 1 and the tubular casing 2, may be performed by means of a separate pressure ring in the form of a pipe end. After having retracted said pipe end the tongue s will enclose the form stabilized ring 5 see also fig. 3 . The front surface of the form stabilized ring 5 not facing the sleeve, may be provided with a circumferential collar 11, which fits against the front surface of the outer pipe or tubular casing 2 see the dot dashline in fig. 2 . The latter feature is of importance in the event that a branch pipe to be provided with an insulating casing at the branch connection, is connected to the fluid pipe 1. The pressures occurring as a result of the branch connection, may then be transmitted to the tubular casing 2 via the circumferential collar 11, thus causing any displacements of the branch pipes to be absorbed by the said tubular casing 2.It is observed that the reference numerals in the claims are not intended to restrict the scope thereof, but are only denoted for clarification.
