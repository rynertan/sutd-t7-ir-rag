# A DEVICE FOR CLAMPING TOOLS

## Abstract
A device for clamping tools, such as a shank end mill, comprises an adjusting nut 1 having a bore for receiving and actuating an adapter sleeve for mechanical clamping of the tool. The adusting nut has at least one pressure medium chamber 7, 8 accommodating a piston 12 and opening into the bore where it is sealed by means of a membrane 9 adapted to rest against the adapter sleeve. A complementary unit 13 is mounted on said adjusting nut for displacing said piston within said chamber, thereby to effect pressure medium controlled, complementary clamping of the tool.
