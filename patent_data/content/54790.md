# Spectral shift reactor control method.

## Abstract
A method of operating a nuclear reactor having a core and coolant displacer elements arranged in the core wherein is established a reactor coolant temperature set point at which it is desired to operate said reactor and first reactor coolant temperature band limits are provided within which said set point is located and it is desired to operate said reactor characterized in that said reactor coolant displacer elements are moved relative to the reactor core for adjusting the volume of reactor coolant in said core as said reactor coolant temperature approaches said first band limits thereby to maintain said reactor coolant temperature near said set point and within said first band limits.
