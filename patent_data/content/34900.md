# Civil engineering and construction machinery with hydraulic drive system.

## Abstract
Hydraulic drive system 60 including at least one hyd raulic pump 120 driven by a prime mover 10 , at least one hydraulic actuator connected to the hydraulic pump, and at least one hydraulic cylinder 6 , the hydraulic actuator and hydraulic cylinder being adapted to operate movable mem bers 4 . The drive system 60 is provided with a hydraulic pump motor 72 driven by the prime mover 10 , first conduit means 64, 82 for connecting the pump motor to one side of the cylinder 6 which moves a movable member 4 in a direction in which the potential energy thereof increases in magnitude upon feeding liquid under pressure thereinto, second conduit means 62, 116 for connecting the other side of the cylinder 6 to a reservoir 16 , and means 74, 78, 88, 94, 96, 100 for controlling the pump motor 72 in such a manner that it functions as a motor when the operator operates the system to move the movable member 4 in a direction in which the potential energy thereof is reduced in magnitude.
