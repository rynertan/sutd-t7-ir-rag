# Chip catching washers.

## Abstract
Self drilling screws and other fastening devices tend to leave drill chips on outer surfaces of metal cladding sheets through which they pass and these chips can corrode and cause deterioration of such sheets. This problem is solved in accordance with the present invention by provid ing a washer 20 through which the fastening device 10 may pass and which includes a cavity 33 which captures and retains drill chips as they are formed. The washer 20 may be positively locatable on the drill point 15 of the fastening member 10 and the cavity 33 can be formed by a skirt region adapted to surround the fastening device 10 . In one aspect, the cavity 33 may include a mastic or like material 22 capable of securely holding drill chips.
