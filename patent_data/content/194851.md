## Description
The invention described herein was made in the course of work under a grant or award from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. The present invention is directed to a therapeutic method for treating human tumors. More specifically, the present invention is directed to a method of treating human tumors with monoclonal antibodies in combination with lentinan. In previous studies it has been shown that murine monoclonal antibodies MAb of IgG2a isotype that bind to human tumor cells spe cifically inhibit growth of the tumor cells in nude mice. Recently, a Mab of IgG3 isotype has also been shown to be effective. Herlyn et al., 1980 It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of tumor therapy. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of tumor therapy employing MAbs in which the therapeutic effects of the MAbs are enhanced. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a method of tumor therapy in which the therapeutic effect of MAbs is enhanced by the stimulation of macrophages. These and other objects of the present invention are achieved by a therapeutic method for human tumors comprising administering to a tumor bearing patient β 1 3 glucan lentinan in an amount sufficient to stimulate macrophage activity and administering to said patient anti tumor monoclonal antibodies after said lentinan administration, said monoclonal antibodies having an isotype selected from the group consisting of IgG2a and IgG3, and binding an antigen on the surface of said patient s tumor cells. It has been discovered that the stimulation of macrophages Generally, the therapeutic method of the present invention com prises first administering lentinan to a tumor bearing patient to stimulate macrophages, and then administering anti tumor MAbs to the patient. Lentinan is a neutral polysaccharide whose physical and chem ical properties are fully characterized. Briefly, it is isolated from a hot water extract from the fruit body of The use of lentinan as a macrophage potentiator has been found to be preferred to other possible potentiators because it is a relatively safe compound to administer to patients. Furthermore, it is more effective than thioglycollate. Other agents, such as BCG and C. parvum, do not activate macrophages for tumor cell lysis by IgG2a MAbs. The effectiveness of the therapeutic regimen of the present invention is dependent upon the timing and dosages of lentinan to the patient. Animal studies indicate that there is an optimal dose of lentinan with higher doses resulting in a decrease in macrophage activation. Other animal studies have indicated that the timing of lentinan administration is an important factor bearing upon the effectiveness of the therapy. Generally, optimal macrophage activation was observed from about 3 to about 5 days following the adminstra tion of lentinan. These time periods are based upon results of animal studies and may be varied somewhat as additional clinical data on humans is available. One skilled in the art, however, being aware that there is an optimal dosage and that there are timing effects in animal studies will be able to establish an optimal dosage and timing of lentinan administration for human patients through routine clinical trials. After a macrophage stimulating quantity of lentinan has been administered to a patient, anti tumor MAbs are administered to the patient The preparation of MAbs for immortal cell lines are well known in the art. For example, immortal, antibody producing cell lines can be produced from normal B cells by hybridoma technology, Epstein Barr virus transformation, or transformation with oncgenic DNA. Those that are skilled in the art are familar with the use of MAbs in tumor therapy and the establishment of optimal dosages through routine clinical trials is well within the skill of the art. See Pharmaceutical products are contemplated to carry out the anti tumor therapy of the present invention. Such products comprise the two components, lentinan and anti tumor monoclonal antibodies. The components should be kept separately, but may be packaged and sold as a kit or individually. The lentinan can be packaged in lyophilized form. The monoclonal antibodies can be pack aged in a suitable physiological buffer, such as physiological saline, and should be kept frozen. The lyophilized lentinan can be reconstituted into liquid form by dissolving in a suitable excipient such as sterile water, less than two weeks before intended use. Once reconstituted, the lentinan solution should be kept refrigerated and in the dark, as it is light sensitive. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients for administration to human patients are well known in the art. The choice of an appropriate excipient is well within the skill of the clinician or pharmacist. A suitable amount of the pharmaceutical product for a single dosage administration is between about 0.5 and 3.5 mg of beta 1 3 glucan lentinan and between about 100 and 500 mg of anti tumor monoclonal anti bodies. Although applicants do not wish to be bound by this theory, it is believed that lentinan indirectly enhances anti tumor cytotoxic effects of macrophages by direct activation of the alternate pathway of the complement system and or by stimulating helper T cells. The possible T cell dependency is supported by the failure to find enhancing effects in athymic mice implanted with human tumors and treated with MAb. The following examples are presented for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. Melanoma cell line WM 9, colorectal carcinoma cell line SW1116 and pancreatic carcinoma cell line Capan have been described. The MAbs included in this study are listed in Table 1. They were produced against colorectal carcinomas, melanomas and pancreatic carcinomas and have been described in detail previously. Preparation of thioglycollate elicited CBA macrophages adherent to wells of microtiter plates has been described. Lentinan activated macrophages were obtained from 6 to 10 week old CBA mice by intraperitoneal i.p. injection of 2.5 mg kg body weight BW of lentinan Ajinomoto Co., Tokyo, Japan unless otherwise stated. Macrophages were collected at various times thereafter and plated as described for thioglycollate elicited macrophages. The ADMC assay with methyl ³H thymidine labeled target cells was performed as described. Binding of iodinated MAbs to Fc receptors on thioglycollate or lentinan activated macrophages was determined by adding to the adher ent macrophages either various amounts of ¹²⁵I MAb or constant amounts of ¹²⁵I MAb mixed with increasing amounts of unlabeled MAb as described. Unkeless et al., 1975 J. Exp. Med. Data were analyzed using the Student s t test. A probability of less than 5 p less than 0.05 was considered significant. Between 0.25 and 5 mg lentinan per kg were administered to mice i.p. ADMC reactivity of peritoneal macrophages against colorectal carcinoma cells SW 1116 coated with MAb 17 1A was assayed 3 days later at two different effector to target E T cell ratios. As can be seen from Fig. 1, the ADMC levels were highest when lentinan was used at 2.5 mg kg BW, and E T cell ratio was 50. Whereas ADMC values increased over the entire dosage range at the lower E T cell ratio of 10, these values were significantly p less than 0.05 lower than those obtained at an E T cell ratio of 50. Therefore, in the ADMC assays described below, macrophages were stimulated by injection of 2.5 mg lentinan per kg BW and E T cell ratios of 50 were used. Increasing the E T cell ratios above 50 did not result in higher ADMC values. Non stimulated resident macrophages caused only 20 and 0 lysis in the presence of MAb 17 1A at E T cell ratios of 50 and 10, respectively. Peritoneal macrophages were assayed for ADMC reactivity, 3, 5, 8 and 11 days following i.p. injection of 2.5 mg lentinan per kg BW. As can be seen from Fig. 2, ADMC activity of macrophages in the presence of specific MAb was highest 5 days following injection of lentinan, whereas values obtained in presence of control MAb did not differ on the various days tested. The increase in the percentage of non phagocytic cells in the macrophage preparations from day 5 after the injection of lentinan might account for the decrease in macrophage activity with time. Therefore, macrophages were generally collected 3 5 days following the injection of lentinan. ADMC reactivity of lentinan stimulated macrophages was compared with the reactivity of thioglycollate elicited macrophages which have been used by us previously to demonstrate ADMC reactivity of IgG2A MAbs. ADMC reactivities of MAbs produced against various human tumors and representing 6 different isotypes are presented in Table I. Lentinan activated macrophages were used as effector cells. In these assays, all the IgG2a and IgG3 MAbs and some of the IgGl MAbs were reactive whereas IgG2b, IgA and IgM MAbs were non reactive. Lentinan and thioglycollate stimulated macrophages bound 2.8 and 3.8 10⁴ molecules of MAb 17 1A per macrophage, respectively. These values did not differ significantly p less than 0.05 . The asso ciation constants were 0.2 10⁸ mole ¹ for both types of macrophages. Since variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art, it is intended that this invention be limited only by the scope of the appended claims.
