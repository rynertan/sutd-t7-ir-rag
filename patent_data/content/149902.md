# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING FUEL TO AN ENGINE DURING COOLANT FAILURE

## Abstract
A fuel control system for an internal combustion engine senses a failure in the coolant system and supplies fuel alternately to each of the two cylinder banks for predeter mined periods of time so that one of the cylinder banks is supplied with an air and fuel mixture to power the engine and the other one of the cylinder banks is supplied with air only to be cooled thereby to extend the safe operating time of the engine. The air fuel ratio of the mixture supplied to the bank provided with a combustible mixture is adjusted to limit the speed of the vehicle to further extend the safe operating time of the engine.
