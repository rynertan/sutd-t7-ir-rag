# Leak proof electrochemical cell.

## Abstract
A leak proof cell comprising a positive can and a negative collector fitted in the opening of the positive can, a gasket made of a synthetic resin being set in the space between the positive can and the negative collector to prevent the leakage of any liquid material in the cell, characterized in that the degree of crystallinity of the gasket set in the cell is at least 10 higher than that of the gasket immediately after molding.
