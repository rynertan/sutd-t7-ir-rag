# AIR DUCT ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
In an air duct assembly, the air duct is integrally provided with a harness sheath which is formed with a laterally openable, longitudinal slit adapted to permit the harness to be inserted in the sheath and retained therein. The harness sheath may be molded, integrally with the air duct, of a polyethylene resin by means of blow molding, for example.
