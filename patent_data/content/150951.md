# Aerobic digestion of sludge.

## Abstract
In the aerobic digestion of sludges, particularly but not exclusively primary sedimentation sewage sludges, a layer of sludge foam is deliberately maintained over the sludge surface to improve the efficiency of the process. The layer of foam may have a volume of at least 50 of that of the sludge. The diges tion process is effected in a digester 70 , in which the horizon tal cross sectional area increases with increasing height. The amount of foam may be reduced as necessary by in jecting sludge directly into the foam to cause local collapse thereof 79, 80 .
