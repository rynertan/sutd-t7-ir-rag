# Improvements in and relating to breathing apparatus.

## Abstract
A self rescue breathing apparatus has a radialflow purifier 3 connected between a mouthpiece and a breathing bag 10. An outer plenum of the purifier is open at both ends, a central con duit is open only at the breathing bag end. Flap valves 50A and 50B control the flow of gas so that exhaled breath passes radi ally inwards through the purifying medium which gas for in halation passes freely up the outer plenum, reducing both the resistance to flow and the heating of the inhaled gas that the purifier which works by exothermic chemical reaction would otherwise cause.
