## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor laser structure and, more particularly, to a semiconductor laser array which includes a current confinement structure and a built in refractive index difference, the refractive index being the vaule of the real part only. A semiconductor laser has widely been used as a light source in an optical information processing system such as an optical disc system and a laser printer. A rapid processing is required in such an optical information processing system as the amount of information to be handled increases. To ensure the rapid processing, the semiconductor laser must emit the laser beam at a high power level in a stable operating range. However, in the conventional semiconductor laser having a single active region, the practical maximum output is around 50 mW. To enhance the output level, a laser device has been proposed, wherein a plurality of semiconductor lasers are aligned in a parallel fashion, and the plurality of semiconductor lasers are optically, phase coupled to each other so as to emit the laser beam in a single phase. This is referred to as the phase coupled laser array. However, in the semiconductor laser array of the gain guide type, the gain is substantially reduced at the coupling region positioned between the adjacent two laser emitting regions and, therefore, the electric field has the phase difference of 180 degrees at the ajacent two laser emitting regions. The far field pattern has a plurality of peaks as shown in FIGURE 1. Thus, the semiconductor laser array of the gain guide type can not endure the practical use. To improve the above mentioned problems, a semiconductor laser array of the index guide type has been proposed. For example, D. E. Ackley et al of Hewlett Packard Laboratories proposed a semiconductor laser array of the leaky mode built in type Appl. Phys. Letters, 39 1 , 1 July 1981. P27 . The proposed laser array ensures an effective coupling of the laser emitting regions, but has two peaks in the far field pattern because of the leaky mode. D. Botez et al of RCA Laboratories proposed a CSP LOC Channeled Substrate Large Optical Cavity laser document of IOOC, 1983. 29B5 2 . The proposed semiconductor laser utilizes the distribution of effective refractive index which is formed by the coupling to the GaAs substrate. The region disposed between the adjacent two laser emitting regions has a high absorption coefficient. The refractive index difference is not obtained when the absorption coefficient is minimized. Accordingly, it is difficult to reduce the phase difference between the adjacent two laser emitting regions to zero. D. E. Ackley of Hewlett Packard Laboratories further proposed the semiconductor laser array of the ridge type Appl. Phys. Letters, 42 2 , 15 January 1983. P152 . Each pair of the adjacent two laser emitting regions has the phase difference of 180 degrees because of the high absorption caused by the electrode disposed at the coupling region of the adjacent two laser emitting regions. E. Kapon et al of California Institute of Technology disclosed an integrated semiconductor laser phased array of the gain guided type having separate contacts for each laser element Appl. Phys. Letters, 44 2 , 15 January 1984. P157 . The individual laser stripes were delineated by using proton implantation and the separate contacting was accomplished by employing two level metalisation. The different laser currents were varied for different results. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a semiconductor laser array comprising In particular, there is provided a semiconductor laser array comprising Further embodiments of the invention are set out in the dependent claims. The present invention will be better understood from the detailed description given hereinbelow and the accompanying drawings which are given by way of illustration only, and thus are not limitative of the present invention and wherein FIGURE 2 shows an embodiment of a semiconductor laser array of the present invention. A semiconductor laser array of the present invention includes a p GaAs substrate 1, a p Ga The AlAs mole fractions of the respective layers must satisfy the following conditions. Each stripe 7 forms the current confinement structure which defines each laser emitting region 9. The active layer 3 included in the laser emitting region 9 emits the laser beam. The regions disposed between the adjacent two laser emitting regions 9 function as optical coupling regions 10 at which the laser beam is optically phase coupled. The laser emitting region 9 and the optical coupling region 10 have the refractive indexes of the real part only, which differ from each other. The refractive index difference should be greater than the reduction of the refractive index 1.3 x 10 Â³ caused by the current injection. The optical guide layer 4 is provided for facilitating the control of the refractive index difference between the laser emitting region 9 and the optical coupling region 10, and for enhancing the optical coupling efficiency between the adjacent laser emitting regions 9. Theoretically, the optical guide layer 4 can be omitted. A semiconductor laser array including five 5 stripes 7 is formed as an example. Figure 3 shows the optical output characteristic of this example, and Figure 4 shows the far field pattern of this example. Figure 4 shows that each laser emitting region 9 is connected to the next laser emitting region 9 with the phase difference of zero degree.
