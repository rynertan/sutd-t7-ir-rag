# Recording digital information signals.

## Abstract
In a system for recording and reproducing digital signals on a magnetic tape 2 using a rotary head 1A, 1B , in which the signals are recorded as a series of oblique tracks 5A, 5B with out guard bands, a pilot signal that controls tracking alignment of a playback head 1A, 1B is recorded at a particular position in a specific pilot signal record region, different from the infor mation signal record region. An erase signal having various recording lengths is also recorded in the pilot signal region such that a start position of the erase signal corresponds substan tially to a centre portion of the pilot signal on the adjacent track 5A, 5B . When the recorded tracks are reproduced by a play back head 1A, 1B having a tracing width greateer than the track width, the pilot signals from the adjacent tracks 5A, 5B will be sampled by sampling pulses generated in response to the reproduced erase signal and compared in level, and the comparison output will be used to control the tracking align ment of the playback head 1A, 1B .
