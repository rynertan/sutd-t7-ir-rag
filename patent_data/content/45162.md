# Sorel cement composition.

## Abstract
A process for producing magnesium oxychioride hydrate cements which involves forming a mixture of water, magne sium chloride hydrate and magnesium oxide in which a minor portion of the magnesium oxide is treated to render it initially substantially unreactive with the magnesium chloride hydrate but capable of slowly reacting with the magnesium chloride hy drate after the initial exotherm reaction of the reactive portion of the magnesium oxide with the magnesium chloride hydrate.
