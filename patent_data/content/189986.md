# Coextruded multilayer sheet and tough sleeve label made therefrom.

## Abstract
A coextruded multilayer sheet adapted to form a sleeve label for a container, characterized by a polystyrene foam layer adapted to be wrapped next to the container and a solid skin layer, the solid skin layer being extruded from a blend comprising about 50 to 70 parts by weight of linear low density polyethylene, and about 20 to 60 parts by weight of a block copolymer of styrene and butadiene, the amount of block copolymer being sufficient to balance the adhesion between the foam layer and the skin layer at the interface thereof, the adhesion being enough to prevent premature delamination and tearing and the adhesion being low enough to enhance the toughness of the label and also a container with such a sleeve label.
