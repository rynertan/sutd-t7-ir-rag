## Description
The present invention relates to interleukin 1 hereinafter IL 1 , and more particularly to purified IL 1 and a process for purifying IL 1 to homogeneity. IL 1, formally known in the literature as lymphocyte activating factor or LAF, is a hormone produced by macrophages while undergoing an immune response. This protein factor regulates a wide range of immunological and non immunological responses. For instance, it is considered that IL 1 mediates activities referred to as endogenous or leukocytic pyrogen, B cell activating factor BAF , epidermal cell thymocyte activating factor ETAF , leukocyte endogenous mediator LEM , bone resorption factor active in rheumatoid arthritis, and a variety of other activities. As such, IL 1 shows promise for therapeutic mediation of immune response, which is defined herein to include the aforementioned activities. Although researchers have identified many of the biological properties of IL 1, the chemical nature of this hormone is not well understood. To date, this has been hampered, at least in part, by the unavailability of sufficient quantities of IL 1 in purified form to carry out necessary investigations. Attempts have been made in the past to purify and partially characterize IL 1 derived from both human and murine sources. For instance, Mizel, 122 In a subsequent communication Mizel et al., 126 Blyden et al., 118 Crude IL 1 prepared from human leukocytes by Togawa et al., 122 Lachman, 42 The availability of adequate quantities of homogeneous human IL 1 could be valuable in investigations and possible treatment of autoimmune disorders such as arthritis and lupus erythmatosis. Also, human IL 1 in greater purity and larger quantities than heretofore available, could prove useful in achieving successful wound and burn healing. One potential method of providing relatively large quantities of homogeneous human IL 1 is through recombinant DNA techniques. Recombinant DNA techniques have been developed for economically producing a desired protein once the gene coding for the protein has been isolated and identified. A discussion of such recombinant DNA techniques for protein production is set forth in the editorial and supporting papers in Vol. 196 of The present invention relates to IL 1, the purification of human IL 1 to homogeneity and the determination of the amino acid composition and partial amino acid sequence of the homogeneous IL 1. In accordance with the present invention, crude preparations of IL 1 were purified by a combination of ion exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography procedures. The affinity chromatography portion of the purification process employed a dye ligand coupled to an insoluble matrix. Based on the prior art, it is contemplated that the same purification process may be successfully employed for IL 1 from other mammalian species, such as murine, bovine or porcine IL 1. Once purified to homogeneity, the amino acid composition and sequence of the IL 1 molecule was analyzed. The amino acid composition of the molecule was ascertained by use of an amino acid analyzer. The amino acid sequence of the N terminal portion of IL 1 molecule was determined by direct Edman degradation technique and also by initially fractionating the molecule, separating the fragments by high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC and then analyzing the HPLC fractions that were found to contain IL 1 peptides by the Edman degradation method. A gene coding for human IL 1 was isolated from a cDNA library with a synthetic oligonucleotide probe corresponding to a portion of the amino acid sequence of human IL 1 as determined above. Total human RNA was extracted from cells thought to produce relatively high levels of IL 1. Polyadenylated mRNA was isolated from the total RNA extract. A cDNA library was constructed by reversed transcription of size separated polyadenylated mRNA with reverse transcriptase. The DNA was rendered double stranded with DNA polymerase I and inserted into an appropriate cloning vector. Resultant recombinant cloning vectors were used to transform an appropriate host. Transformed hosts were identified and grouped into pools. Plasmid DNA prepared from these pools was hybridized with the oligonucleotide probe that had been radiolabeled. The pool s of clones that gave a positive signal to the probe was identified and then the putative pool subdivided and the hybridization screen repeated. By this procedure, a single transformant was eventually identified. Plasmid DNA was prepared from this transformant and characterized by restriction endonuclease digestion. The IL 1 gene was sequenced to establish its nucleic acid and amino acid compositions. Also the IL 1 gene was cloned in an The details of typical embodiments of the present invention will be described in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which Crude preparations of IL 1 are prepared from peripheral blood leukocytes. The leukocytes are separated from whole blood by well known techniques, such as by centrifugation over a volume of Ficoll Hypaque solution. The leukocytes removed from the blood are cultured Rather than being obtained from leukocytes removed from whole blood, IL 1 can alternatively be prepared from monocytes derived from any monocyte rich source. Such monocyte sources include monocytic leukemic spleen cells, lymph cells and alevolar macrophages. The medium used to culture the peripheral blood leukocytes may consist of commercially available media, such as Eagle s Minimum Essential Medium MEM or Roswell Park Memorial Institute RPMI medium. Additives, which may be individually or in combination added to the culture medium, include glutamine, HEPES buffer and various antibiotics, such as gentamycin, penicillin and streptomycin. In the past, serum also has been commonly used as an additive. However, applicants have discovered that in the procedures of the present invention, purification of IL 1 from the culture supernatant is facilitated if serum is not used in the culture. Although not employing serum has been found to result in a three to five fold reduction in the quantity of IL 1 produced in culture, the absence of serum also results in a 100 fold reduction in total protein produced, which lessens the complications involved in the purification of the IL 1. Preferable stimulating agents used in conjunction with the present invention include The process of culturing the leukocytes to induce secretion of IL 1 may be carried out in various environmental conditions. Preferably, however, the cultures are maintained in the temperature range of approximately 35 38 C in a humidified atmosphere of approximately 5 10 CO₂ in air. The quantity of IL 1 released by stimulation of peripheral blood leukocytes with an activating agent varies with time. Applicants have found that optimum levels of IL 1 expression are reached at approximately 24 72 hours after stimulation. A thymocyte proliferation assay, an IL 1 conversion assay and a protein assay are employed in conjunction with the present invention to monitor the IL 1 activity level and the protein content of the samples during the purification, cloning and IL 1 expression procedures of the present invention. Also, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS PAGE and two dimensional gel electrophoresis are used to analyze the IL 1 activity during the purification process. This assay involves ascertaining the capacity of a sample of IL 1 to induce proliferation of thymocytes derived from CD 1 mice. In this assay, approximately 1 x 10⁶ thymocytes obtained from 10 to 12 week old CD 1 mice Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Wilmington, MA are seeded in round bottom microplate wells Corning Plastics Corning, New York in the presence of three fold serial dilutions of IL 1 containing samples. The thymocytes are cultured in 150 microliters ul of MEM containing 50 units milliliter U ml penicillin, 50 micrograms milliliter ug ml streptomycin, 2 millimolar mM glutamine, 0.2 mM gentamycin, 10 mM HEPES buffer, jointly referred to as Supplemented MEM , pH 7.4, together with 3 v v human serum and 10 ⁵ molar M 2 mercaptoethanol. The samples are cultured for 72 hours at 37 C in an atmosphere of 5 CO₂ in air. Thereafter the cultures are pulsed for approximately 4 hours with 0.5 microcuries uCi of tritiated thymodine ³H Tdr , New England Nuclear, Boston. Massachusetts, 2 Ci mM specific activity , after which the cultures are harvested onto glass fiber filter strips, for instance with the aid of a multiple automated sample harvester. ³H Tdr incorporation is then measured by liquid scintillation counting. Details of this procedure are disclosed in Gillis et al., 120 By this thymocyte proliferation assay procedure, only the CD 1 thymocytes cultured in the presence of IL 1 incorporate ³H Tdr in a dose dependent manner. CD 1 cells cultured in the absence of IL 1 incorporate only background levels of ³H Tdr. IL 1 activity is calculated from the linear portion of the ³H Tdr incorporation data in a manner similar to the procedure used by Gillis et al., A second alternative assay for IL 1 activity may be employed which takes advantage of the fact that IL 1 was found by applicants to convert an interleukin 2 IL 2 nonproducer murine tumor cell line, LBRM 33 145, to an IL 2 producer. In this assay LBRM 33 1A5 cells, ATCC No. CRL 8079, are inactivated by addition of 50 ug ml of mitomycin C and incubated for 1 hour at 37 C. 100 ul of the inactivated LBRM 33 1A5 cells 5 x 10⁵ cells ml are cultured in 96 well flat bottomed plates in the presence of an equal volume of the mitogen, phytohemagglutinin PHA 1 final concentration together with serial dilutions of IL 1 containing fluid samples. After 6 24 hours, the existence of IL 2 activity, generated by IL 1 triggered, mitomycin C inhibited LBRM 33 1A5 cells and thus IL 1 activity , is directly ascertained by adding 50 ul of IL 2 dependent CTLL 2 cells 8 x 10⁴ cells ml . The microwell cultures are then incubated for 20 additional hours followed by a 4 hour pulse with 0.5 uCi of ³H Tdr New England Nuclear, Boston, MA, 2 Ci mM specific activity . Thereafter, the thymidine pulsed cultures are harvested onto glass fiber filter strips with the aid of a multiple automated sample harvester MASH II Microbiological Associates, Bethesda, MD . ³H Tdr incorporation is measured by liquid scintillation counting. Details of this procedure are set forth in Gillis et al. The protein content of the purification samples is determined by Biorad protein assay which is commercially available from Biorad, Richmond, California. This assay employs bovine serum albumin as a standard. The principles and details of this assay are discussed in Bradford, 72 The culture supernatant and chromatography column fractions are analyzed by SDS PAGE to monitor the purification procedures of the present invention. This assay is conducted according to the gel stacking procedure of Laemmli, 227 The particular assay samples that contain a high salt concentration are initially dialyzed against 0.001 SDS in 0.1 mM NH₄HCO₃ and then dried under a vacuum. The dried residue is dissolved in a reducing buffer 2 SDS , 1 2 mercaptoethanol prior to the SDS PAGE process. After completion of the purification procedures of the present invention, the IL 1 is analyzed by two dimensional polacrylamide gel electrophoresis by the method described in Sammons et al., 2 The supernatant resulting from the blood leukocyte culture as prepared by the above procedure is purified by cation exchange chromatography, anion exchange chromatography, and affinity chromatography employing a dye ligand coupled to a column matrix. All chromatography fractions are assayed for IL 1 activity and protein concentration. Where appropriate, pH and conductivity are measured. Following each chromatography step, samples are analyzed by SDS PAGE. In addition, after completion of the affinity chromatography procedure, active fractions are analyzed by two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as discussed above. A suitable column for the cation exchange chromatograpy process is composed of sulfopropyl Sephadex C 25 Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, New Jersey . Preferably, the column is equilibrated with buffer prior to application of the IL 1 sample and then washed with the same or different buffer after the IL 1 sample has been applied to the column to remove nonbound protein without elution of IL 1 activity. Elution of the IL 1 from the column is carried out with a buffered elutant of sufficient pH to disassociate the IL 1 from the column. The pooled active fractions from the cation exchange chromatography procedure are further purified by anion exchange chromatography. Applicants have found that a suitable column material for this purpose is DEAE Sephacel. The DEAE Sephacel column is equilibrated with a buffer and the sample concentrate applied to the column. Elution is initially carried out with the starting buffer and then subsequently with a linear salt gradient in the same buffer. Fractions are collected and analyzed as discussed above. The IL 1 in the pooled active fractions from the DEAE Sephacel column is further purified by affinity column chromatography employing a synthetic triazinyl textile dye ligand coupled to a support matrix. Various dye colors may be employed including blue or red. The dye is coupled to an appropriate column matrix composed of, for instance, agarose, polyacrylamide, cellulose or silica based inorganic materials via an ether linkage to the trazine ring or alternatively via a primary amine or an anthraquinone group of the dye. Rather than being bound directly to a support matrix, the dye can be bound to high molecular weight dextran with the dextran then immobilized to a column matrix. Partial chemical structures of blue and red dye ligands coupled to a matrix are shown in FIGURES 1 and 2, respectively. It is to be understood that these dye structures can be modified to form analogs, for instance by exchanging the positions of the sulfonated anthraquinone group relative to the triazine ring or by substituting a sulfonate salt for the sulfonic acid substituents. See Fulton, Prior to applying the IL 1 containing fractions purified over SP Sephadex and DEAE Sephacel to the dye ligand column, it may be necessary to lower the ionic strength of the pooled active fractions. Also, the presence of a divalent cation, such as Mg or Ca , may enhance the binding of IL 1 to the dye ligand. The column is equilibrated with an appropriate buffer, such as Tris HCL, and then the pooled DEAE fractions containing IL 1 activity are applied to the column. Thereafter, the column is washed with the same starting buffer and then elution is carried out with a linear salt gradient in the same buffer or a specific soluble ligand. Fractions are collected and analyzed as discussed above. Applicants have discovered that red triazinyl textile dye, when used under the stated column conditions, is especially highly specific for binding IL 1. A commercial brand of this red dye corresponding to FIGURE 2 is Procion red reactive red 120 Imperial Chemical Industries . Applicants have also discovered that blue triazinyl textile dye when used under the stated column conditions is also highly specific for binding IL 1, i.e. approximately 80 as specific as red triazinyl textile dye. A commercial brand of blue dye is Cibacron Blue 36A Ciba AG . By the aforementioned purification process, applicants have purified human IL 1 protein to greater than 99 purity while maintaining a high yield of about 53 from the starting supernatant. By the above described assay procedures, applicants have determined that human IL 1 is composed of a singular molecular weight specie of approximately 17,500 daltons molecular weight. This molecular weight is substantially heavier than previously reported for either human or murine IL 1. Moreover, contrary to reports of other observers, no other molecular weight species of IL 1 were found by applicants. See Lachman, In addition to making possible the biological study of IL 1 free from contamination by other proteins, the ability to prepare homogeneous IL 1 has enabled applicants to determine the amino acid composition of the IL 1 molecule. This information may be employed to assist in the cloning of the IL 1 gene and the production of large quantities of pure IL 1 for clinical trials and ultimately for clinical use. Samples of purified IL 1 from the affinity chromatography procedure are analyzed for amino acid composition with an automated analyzer using ninhydrin detection. Observed peaks are integrated with commercially available recording integrator. Through this technique, applicants have determined the amino acid composition of the IL 1 molecule as summarized in Table I in Example 4, below. Since the amino acid residue cysteine Cys is unstable to hydrolysis, this residue is not detected by automated ninhydrin analysis. The presence of the Cys residue was detected by the amino acid sequencing analysis, discussed below. Also, automated ninhydrin analysis does not distinguish aspartic acid residues from asparagine residues nor does it distinguish glutamic acid residues from glutamine residues. However, from the amino acid sequencing analysis, discussed below, an asparagine residue and six glutamine residues were detected in a N terminal portion of the IL 1 molecule consisting of 42 amino acid residues . Thus, in Table I the aspartic acid and asparagine residues are listed together, as are the glutamic acid and glutamine residues. Applicants have also investigated the amino acid sequence of the IL 1 molecule. Applicants have discovered that in the purified IL 1 prepared by the procedures set forth above, the N terminus of this molecule is partially blocked. As such, the molecule is not readily amenable to the chemical analysis technique employed in automated amino acid sequencing apparatuses, and thus the amino acid sequence of the entire molecule could not be determined by standard analysis procedures. As a result, applicants employed a combination of two techniques to analyze the sequence of the N terminal portion of the protein molecule. As a first technique applicants subjected a rather large sample of over 11 ug of IL 1, as purified to homogeneity by the aforediscussed methods, to amino terminal Edman degradation sequence analysis with an automated sequencing apparatus. By this technique the first 20 residues of the N terminal portion of the IL 1 molecule was found to be composed of the following sequence NH₂ Ala Pro Val Arg Ser Leu Asn Cys Thr Leu Arg Asp Ser Gln Gln Lys Ser Leu Val Met. The 8th residue was deduced to be Cys. In the eighth cycle of the automated sequencing procedure no other residue was obtained in high yield, which points to the conclusion that the eighth residue is composed of Cys which is not affirmatively detected by Edman degradation , a glycosylated threonine residue or a glycosylated serine Ser residue. These later two possibilities were elmininated since, as discussed below, no glucosamine or galactosamine was observed from the amino acid composition analysis. This leads to the conclusion that the 8th residue is composed of Cys. As a second amino acid sequence analysis technique, applicants fractionated the molecule at the argine residues with the enzyme trypsin. To prevent the trypsin from also cleaving the IL 1 molecule at the lysine sites, the side chains of the lysine molecule were protected with a specific blocking agent. Preferably, the trypsin is treated with L 1 tosylamin S phenylethylchloromethylketone TPCK to deactivate other contaminating enzymes, such as chymotryspin, that may also be present, thereby minimizing the possibility that the IL 1 protein will be cleaved at other residues. It is to be understood that rather than employing trypsin, other enzymes may be used to cleave the IL 1 molecules at other residue sites. After cleavage of the IL 1 molecule, the resulting peptides were separated on the basis of hydrophobocity by HPLC procedures. The HPLC technique used in the present invention preferably employs a reversed phase, octadecyl bonded silica column having a pore size sufficiently large to be optimally utilized with the proteineaceous IL 1 peptides, i.e., a pore size of at least 300 A. Suitable reversed phase HPLC columns for use in the practice of the present invention are articles of commerce. A preferred column for this purpose is the Vydac 218 TP reversed phase column commercially available from Separations Group, Hesperia, California. This column consists of octadecyl silane groups covalently bonded by means of a siloxane silican oxygen silicaon bond to the surface of the 300 A pore diameter silica gel which has been classified to a mean particle size of 5 microns. It is to be understood that the use of other reversed phase columns is within the scope of the present invention. The IL 1 peptides that are bonded to the octadecyl column are eluted by the use of a linear gradient of acetonitrile. A preferred gradient for this purpose is a 0 to 95 v v acetonitrile gradient in trifluoroacetic acid TFA , pH 2.0. The eluted peptides can be conveniently monitored with commercially available detection systems. For example, the relative protein concentration in the fractions eluted from the HPLC columns can be determined by measuring absorbance of the eluted material with an automated ultraviolet light spectrophotometer, at 230 nanometers wavelength. A suitable automated ultraviolet light absorbance detection apparatus is available from Waters Associates, Millford, Maine. Alternatively, protein elution can be monitored with an automated fluorescence detection system, as described by Stein and Moschera, 78 The eluted HPLC fractions are analyzed in sequence by gel eletrophoresis, discussed above, to determine the number of peptides contained in each of the HPLC fractions. Thereafter, the peptides are concentrated The first four residues of the amino terminal portion of this amino acid fragment corresponds with the last four residues of the C terminal portion of the sequence determined above by automated Edman degradation technique, thus leading to the conclusion that the first 42 residues of the N terminal portion of the Il 1 molecule is composed of the following sequence NH₂ Ala Pro Val Arg Ser Leu Asn Cys Thr Leu Arg Asp Ser Gln Gln Lys Ser Leu Val Met Ser Gly Pro Tyr Glu Leu Lys Ala Leu His Leu Gln Gly Gln Asp Met Glu Gln Gln Val Val Phe Total RNA from human IL 1 producing cells is extracted by standard methods, such as disclosed by Chirgwin et al., 18 As is well known, when extracting RNA from cells, it is important to minimize ribonuclease RNase activity during the initial stages of extraction. One manner in which this is accomplished is to denature the cellular protein, including the RNase, at a rate that exceeds the rate of RNA hydrolysis by RNase. In the procedures of Chirgwin et al., Next, polyadenylated mRNA is separated from the extracted protein. Although several techniques have been developed to carry out this separation process, one preferred method is to chromatograph the polyadenylated mRNA on oligo dT cellulose as described by Edmonds et al., 68 The polyadenylated mRNA is then sized by electrophoresis through methylmercury agarose gel fractions corresponding to different size classes of mRNA and then translated In the A library of double stranded cDNA corresponding to the mRNA, as prepared and assayed above, is constructed by known techniques employing the enzyme reverse transcriptase. One such procedure which may be employed in conjunction with the present invention is detailed by Maniatis et al., It is to be understood that alternative standard procedures may be employed to prepare double stranded cDNA from mRNA. One such alternative technique is disclosed by Land et al., 9 Next, the double stranded cDNA is inserted within a cloning vector which is used to transform compatible prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells for replication of the vector. Thereafter, the transformants are identified and plasmid DNA prepared therefrom. Various cloning vectors may be utilized. Although the preference is for a plasmid, the vector may be a bacteriophage or a cosmid. If cloning occurs in mammalian cells, viruses also can be used as vectors. If a plasmid is employed, it may be obtained from a natural source or artificially synthesized. The particular plasmid chosen should be compatible with the contemplated transformation host, whether a bacteria such as If If a bacteriophage is used instead of a plasmid, such phages should have substantially the same characteristics noted above for selection of plasmids This includes the existence of a phenotypic marker and ligatable termini for attachment of foreign genes. Preferably, the double stranded cDNA, having blunt ends, is inserted into a plasmid vector by homopolymeric tailing. As is well known in the art, in this technique, complementary homopolymer tracks are added to the strands of the cDNA and to the plasmid DNA. The vector and double stranded cDNA are then joined together by hydrogen bonding between complementary homopolymeric tails to form open, circular hybrid molecules capable of transforming host cells, such as In one procedure for homopolymeric tailing, approximately 50 to 150 dA nucleotide residues are added to the 3 ends of linearized plasmid DNA. A similar number of dT nucleotide residues are added to the 3 ends of the double stranded cDNA and then the cDNA and plasmid joined together. In an alternative and preferred method, dG tails are added to the 3 ends of the cloning vector that has been cleaved with an appropriate restriction enzyme. For instance, if the pBR322 plasmid is employed, the restriction enzyme Pst I may be used to digest the plasmid at the ampicillin resistant gene. Complementary dC tails are added to the 3 ends of the double stranded cDNA prior to insertion of the cDNA segment in the plasmid with an appropriate annealing buffer. It is to be understood that the double stranded cDNA may be inserted within plasmid cloning vectors by other various standard methods. One such alternative technique involves attaching synthesized nucleotide linkers to the ends of the cDNA strands by using DNA ligase. The linkers are cleaved with a restriction enzyme to generate cohesive termini for insertion within a plasmid cleaved with the same restriction enzyme. Scheller et al., 196 The recombinant DNA plasmids, as prepared above, are used to transform host cells. Although the host may be any appropriate prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell, it is preferably a well defined bacteria, such as If In transformation protocols, including those disclosed by Maniatis et al., A radiolabeled synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to part of the N terminal portion of the amino acid sequence of human IL 1 molecule, as determined above, is used as a probe to screen the cDNA library. The hybridization of the synthetic oligonucleotide probe with plasmid cDNA prepared from the library clones is subsequently identified by autoradiography. The N terminal portion of the amino acid composition of IL 1 molecule was determined above as composed of the residues NH₂ Ala Pro Val Arg Ser Leu Asn Cys Thr Leu Arg Asp Ser Gly Gln Lys Ser Leu Val Met Ser Gly Pro Tyr Glu Leu Lys Ala Leu His Leu Gln Gly Gln Asp Met Glu Gln Gln Val. This sequence information is employed as the basis for the synthetic oligonucleotide probe. Applicants developed a synthetic oligonucleotide from the above amino acid sequence for use as a probe to screen plasmid DNA thought to contain the IL 1 gene. The probe is composed of the following sequence which corresponds to the antisense sequence coded for by the above amino acid sequence downstream from the first Met residue 5 AC TTG TTG TTC CAT GTC TTG GCC TTG CAG GTG CAG GGC TTT CAG TTC GTA GGG GCC GGA CAT 3 . This probe has the advantage of being short enough to be easily synthesized, while being long enough to contain sufficient information to be useful as a probe for the IL 1 gene. Although the described oligonucleotide sequence is a preferred composition of the synthetic probe of the present invention, it is to be understood that probes of other compositions corresponding to other segments of N terminal amino acid sequence of the IL 1 molecule can be employed without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The synthetic oligonucleotide probes may be chemically synthesized by well known techniques, such as by phosphodiester or triester methods. The details of the triester synthesis technique are set forth in Sood et al., 4 In the screening procedure of the present invention, the transformants are pooled into groups each composed of approximately 2,000 transformants. The replicated plasmids are extracted from the transformants using any one of several well known techniques, such as by alkaline lysis. Plasmid DNA is prepared by cleaving the plasmids at the Pvu II and Hind III restriction sites, both being unique sites on the hybrid plasmid. The resulting DNA segments are fractionated by electrophoresis on agarose gel and then directly analyzed by Southern blotting as described in Southern, 98 The particular pool s of clones that give a signal following autoradiography are plated out and used in direct bacterial colony hybridization on a nitrocellulose filter with the same above identified oligonucleotide probes. After completion of the hybridization, the nitrocellulose filter is monitored by autoradiography to identify the largest colony. In the present invention, applicants discovered one such colony. Plasmid DNA designated as IL 1 X 14 is prepared from the particular positive colony identified. The plasmid DNA prepared above is characterized by restriction enzyme mapping. Various strategies for restriction enzyme mapping are discussed by Maniatis et al., The mapped plasmid cDNA illustrated in FIGURE 3 was sequenced using the chair termination method. This method of nucleotide sequencing was originated by Sanger et al., 70 The DNA and corresponding amino acid sequences of the plasmid cDNA in FIGURE 3, as determined by the above techniques, is illustrated in FIGURE 4. The nucleotides are numbered from the beginning of the sequence shown in FIGURE 4. The amino acids are numbered beginning from the mature NH₂ terminus of the IL 1 protein, i.e., the Ala residue, marked with an arrow, and extending to the Ser residue No. 153 located adjacent the termination codon TAA. The coding region of the IL 1 gene, extending from the Ala codon to the TAG termination codon, is shown as a box portion in FIGURE 3. The restriction enzyme cleaving sites identified in FIGURE 3 are also indicated in FIGURE 4. In preparation for the sequencing procedures, the plasmid cDNA section shown in FIGURE 3 is digested with various restriction endonucleases and then the resulting DNA fragments cloned into M13 phage vectors to form single stranded DNA templates. A universal primer is used to sequence upstream and downstream from intermediate locations of the sense and antisense strands. Rather than relying on the sequencing results obtained from sequencing the entire length of the fragments with a single chain termination procedure, additional synthetically produced primers are used to initiate the chain termination procedure from other intermediate locations along the lengths of the strands. By this process, both strands of the plasmid cDNA shown in FIGURE 3 are sequenced in overlapping fashion, thereby serving to redundantly confirm the sequences. It is to be understood that rather than employing the chain termination technique outlined above, other known methods may be utilized to sequence the IL 1 gene. For instance, the chemical degradation method of Maxam and Gilbert as set forth in 74 Amino acid sequence studies of IL 1 prepared as above and purified were conducted according to the method of Stern et al., To determine whether the cDNA coding region of the IL 1 X 14 clone could encode functional IL 1, the clone is expressed in a prokaryotic eukaryotic host system. A hybrid cDNA fragment containing the coding region of the IL 1 X 14 clone is inserted into a shuttle expression vector having two sets of replication sequences, a first sequence for amplification of the vector in prokaryotic host cells, and a second sequence for high level expression of the foreign structural protein, i.e., IL 1, in eukaryotic host cells. The transformed eukaryotic host cells are harvested and assayed for expression of mature IL 1 by use of the above detailed thymocyte proliferation assay and IL 2 conversion assay. Various types of shuttle vectors have been developed. A common type includes an origin of replication and promoter sequences that signal DNA replication in prokaryotic cells, typically A preferable shuttle vector for carrying out the present invention is designated as pY ADH. As illustrated schematically in FIGURE 5, the pY ADH plasmid includes an origin of replication from plasmid pBR322 for high copy DNA expression in As illustrated in FIGURE 5, the pY ADH IL 1 plasmid is prepared as an expression vector for expression of IL 1 gene by insertion of the coding region of the IL 1 gene in plasmid pY ADH. Samples of this shuttle vector are on deposit with the American Type Culture Collection ATCC , 12361 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Maryland 20852, under Accession No. 39967. This deposit was made on 21st December 1984 and is of plasmid pY ADH IL 1 in The IL 1 cDNA fragment together with the synthetic oligonucleotide are inserted in shuttle vector pY ADH which previously has been digested with appropriate restriction enzymes corresponding to the configurations of the 5 terminal of the synthetic oligonucleotide and the 3 terminal of the major IL 1 cDNA fragment. The resultant recombinant shuttle vector pY ADH IL 1 is used to transform a prokaryotic host, e.g., The processes and products of the present invention are further illustrated by the following examples. Leukocyte concentrates of a volume of 350 400 ml, obtained from human whole blood mixture from Portland, Oregon Red Cross , were mixed with and diluted in Ca , Mg free phosphate buffered saline PBS layered onto Histopaque Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO and then centrifuged at 600 x g for 30 minutes at room temperature. The interface layer, consisting of the leukocytes, was recovered, washed with PBS and centrifuged at 400 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature. The cells were washed two more times in Ca , Mg free PBS and centrifuged at 200 x g for 10 minutes after each washing. The resulting mononuclear cells in a concentration of 2 x 10⁶ cells ml, were cultured in spinner flasks in MEM Medium. The medium was supplemented with 50 U ml penicillin, 50 ug ml streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, 0.2 mM gentamycin, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. The cells were stimulated into IL 1 production by the addition of 0.01 mg ml of heat inactivated, formalin fixed, IL 1 containing supernatants, as prepared in Example 1, were purified by cation exchange chromatography and anion exchange chromatography. These chromatography procedures were performed at 4 C and the gels used therein were pretreated with 0.1 Triton X and 10 v v fetal calf serum to reduce non specific absorption of IL 1 activity to the resins. Prior to the chromatography procedures, the culture supernatant was assayed, as described above. The crude IL 1 solutions were found to have a typical total activity of 1.98 x 10⁷U, a specific activity of 6.37 x 10⁴U mg of sample and a total protein content of 3.11 x 10⁵ug. The ionic strength of the culture supernatant was adjusted by addition of 1 M sodium citrite buffer, pH 4.0, to a final concentration of 10 mM citrite and also was reduced to a pH of 4.0 with concentrated HCl. The supernatant as thus adjusted was applied to 30 x 1.6 cm column of sulfopropyl Sephadex SPS C 25 Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, NJ which had been previously equilibrated with the same buffer together with 150 mM NaCl, pH 4.0. The culture supernatant was applied to the column at a rate of 400 ml hour. After loading was completed, the column was washed with 10 column volumes of 10 mM 2 N morpholino ethanesulfonic acid MES buffer, pH 5.0, to remove unbound protein. The bound protein was then eluted from the column with four column volumes of 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.1, applied to the column at a rate of 50 ml hour. The pH of a column was found to rise after application of approximately three column volumes of the eluant thereby resulting in elution of the IL 1 peak. Column fractions were collected and assayed, as discussed above. Applicants found that the IL 1 eluted from the cation exchange column exhibited an activity of approximately 1.1 x 10⁷U and specific activity of approximately 2.10 x 10⁵U mg thereby achieving approximately a three fold increase in IL 1 activity while retaining approxmately 56 of the initial IL 1. Also, approximately 80 of the contaminating proteins were removed by the cationic exchange chromatography procedure. The pooled concentrate from the cation exchange column was further purified by anion exchange chromatography on a column of DEAE Sephacel Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, NJ . The DEAE Sephacel column was equilibrated with 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.1. Since the IL 1 was eluted off the SPS column with this same equilibration buffer, the SPS pool was loaded directly onto the DEAE Sephacel column at a rate of 20 ml hr, thereby avoiding any loss of activity by dialysis. After loading, the column was washed with five column volumes of the same equilibrating buffer and then elution was carried out with a linear gradient of four column volumes of 0 400 mM NaCl in 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.1. Applicants found that the IL 1 activity eluted in a sharp peak at 0.08 0.12 M NaCl. SDS PAGE analysis of the elution fractions revealed some high molecular weight contaminants as well as three major bands of molecular weights of approximately 17,500, 15,000 and 12,000 daltons. Analysis of the column eluate revealed a total activity of 7.75 x 10⁶U, a specific activity of 2.58 x 10⁶U mg, total protein of 3 x 10³ug and a yield of approximately 39 . The active fractions from Example 2 was pooled for further purification by affinity chromatography technique employing a 10 x 1.6 cm column of the dye ligand Procion red dye coupled to an agarose matrix Bethesda Research Laboratories, Bethesda, MD, Cat. No. 5926 SA that had been preequilibrated in 10 mM Tris HCl buffer, pH 8.1. To optimize the binding of the IL 1 to the dye ligand column, the ionic strength of the DEAE Sephacel pool was lowered to below 40 mM by dilution of the pool 1 4 in 10 mM Tris HCl buffer, pH 8.1. The dye ligand column was initially washed with four column volume of the same starting buffer to remove unbound protein and then elution is carried out with a linear gradient composed of fifteen column volumes of 0 to 1.0 M NaCl in 10 mM Tris HCl buffer, pH 8.1. Applicants have found that the IL 1 activity typically was eluted in a sharp peak at 0.50 0.55 M NaCl. Column fractions were collected and assayed as described above. SDS PAGE analysis of the IL 1 active fractions revealed a single protein band having a molecular weight of approximately 17,500 daltons. The high molecular weight bands, noted above, were eluted in the flow through from column and the lower molecular weight bands of 15,000 and 12,000 daltons were eluted at a higher salt concentration. Assays conducted on the active IL 1 fractions revealed a total activity of the IL 1 of about 6.2 x 10⁶U, a specific activity of about 9.5 x 10⁸U mg, and a total protein content of approximately 6.5 ug. This equates to an overall purity of IL 1 of greater than 99 and a yield of approximately 31 from the starting supernatants. It is clear from the single protein band which resulted from the SDS PAGE and silver staining of the fractions collected after dye ligand affinity chromatography, and also from the specific activities of the fractions analyzed, that essential homogenity of the IL 1 molecule was achieved by the present invention while maintaining a high yield of the IL 1. The homogeneous IL 1 obtained from the dye ligand affinity chromatography was also analyzed by two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis together with silver staining, as noted above. This procedure consistently yielded four staining spots at exactly the same molecular weight, i.e., 17,500 daltons and stained the same color in silver stain. The spots were always in the same position and the same relative proportions regardless of which lot of starting supernatant was used. The most intense spot has indicated a pI of 6.3 5.9. The other three spots stain less intensely as the pH gradient becomes more acid. These results indicate that human IL 1 exists As an alternative to Example 3, active fractions from Example 2 are pooled and then further purified by essentially the same affinity chromatography technique used in Example 3 with the exception that the dye ligand was composed of Cibacron Blue 36A dye cross linked to an agarose matrix Bethesda Research Laboratories, Bethesda, MD, Cat. No. 5904 SA . Assays conducted on the active fractions revealed a total activity of the IL 1 of about 5.0 x 10⁶ U and a specific activity of about 7.6 x 10⁸ U mg. which is approximately 80 of the activity present in the red dye derived IL 1. To achieve greater purity, the active fractions from the blue dye ligand affinity chromatograhy can be collected and the process repeated. Purified IL 1 from Example 3 or 4 was boiled The amino acid composition of human IL 1 as determined by the present technique is set forth in Table I below. As indicated by Table I, no glucosamine or galactosamine has been observed from the above amino acid analysis which corresponds with applicants prior findings that human IL 1 migrates as a single molecular weight species on polyacrylamide gels. One or both of these observations would likely be contrary if human IL 1 includes attached carbohydrate moieties. Thus, it is unlikely that human IL 1 is a glycoprotein. Fractions containing homogenious IL 1 from the dye ligand affinity chromatography procedures of Examples 3 or 4 initially were diluted 10 fold with deionized distilled water, adjusted to pH 4.0 with 1 N HCL and then applied to a 0.5 ml bed volume SPS C 25 chromatography column. Prior to the application of the IL 1, the column was equilibrated with a buffer composed of 0.1 M sodium citrate, 0.05 M NaCl, pH 4.0. After loading of the IL 1, the column was washed with 10 ml of the same equilibration buffer followed with 20 ml of deionized, distilled water. Thereafter, the IL 1 was eluted with 10 mM sodium borate, pH 9.0. In a first sequencing analysis procedure, 11.1 ug of homogeneous IL 1, as concentrated above, was dried under vacuum and then subjected directly to automated amino terminal Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems Model 470 protein sequencer. By this process applicants discovered that the N terminal portion of the IL 1 molecule is composed of the following sequence of amino acid residues NH₂ Ala Pro Val Arg Ser Leu Asn Cys Thr Leu Arg Asp Ser Glu Gln Lys Ser Leu Val Met Next, 2 ug of TPCK treated trypsin Worthington in 10 ul of 10 mM HCl, pH 2.0 was added to the reaction mixture to cleave the IL 1 molecule at the arginine residues. After addition of the trypsin, the mixture was gently stirred for 5 seconds and then incubated at 37 C for two hours. After completion of the incubation period, an additional 2 ug of TPCK treated trypsin was added and the mixture incubated at 37 C for an additional 2 hours. The mixture was then cooled to room temperature and adjusted to pH 2.5 with 90 formic acid Baker . After standing for 4 hours at room temperature, the acidified mixture was diluted by adding 0.5 ml of 6 M guanidine HCl and then injected onto a 4.6 x 250 mm Vydac 218 TP column, which previously had been equilibrated with 0.1 TFA v v in water, at a flow rate of about 1 ml min. with a Beckman Model 112 pump Beckman Instruments, Division of Smith Kline Beckman . The loaded column was initially washed with 0.1 TFA v v in water to remove non bound components and then the IL 1 peptides were eluted from the column with a linear gradient of 0 100 acetonitrile in 0.1 TFA v v at a rate of 0.5 min. at a now rate of 1 ml min. The elution of the peptides was detected by ultraviolet light spectrophotometry at 230 nanometers wavelength. Individual fractions or pools composed of two or more fractions containing IL 1 peptides were sequenced by automated amino terminal Edman degradation. Prior to the sequencing, the HPLC fractions containing IL 1 were analyzed by gel electrophoresis to determine the number of peptides in each fraction. Thereafter, the peptides were concentrated Mononuclear cells prepared as discussed above in the first paragraph of Example 1 were added to plastic culture flasks in RPMI 1640 medium together with 10 fetal bovine serum v v . Following a two hour incubation at 37 C, nonadherent cells were decantled and the flasks were then replenished with additional serum supplemented RPMI 1640 medium containing 20 ug ml Total RNA was extracted from the adherent mononuclear cells by the method as described by Chirgwin et al., Thereafter, polyadenylated mRNA was separated from the extracted protein on an oligo dT cellulose chromatography column using the method disclosed by Maniatis et al., The polyadenylated mRNA was sized by electrophoresis through methylmercury agarose. Gel fractions corresponding to different size classes of mRNA were then translated A library of double stranded cDNA corresponding to the mRNA was prepared from the purified mRNA in Example 7 by employing the standard procedure detailed by Maniatis et al., The double stranded cDNA was fractionated into size classes by Sephacryl S 400 Pharmacia Fine Chemicals column chromatography and monitored by analysis using alkaline agarose electrophoresis employing end labeled fragments of pBR322 DNA as molecular weight markers. DNA strands having a length of less than 500 bp were culled out to avoid needless cloning of these undersized cDNA fractions. The double stranded cDNA fractions, as prepared above, were inserted into the Pst I site of the pBR322 plasmid Pharmacia Fine Chemicals by the method disclosed by Maniatis et al., The recombinant plasmids were transformed into A synthetic oligonucleotide was employed as a probe in screening the cDNA library prepared as set forth above in Example 8. The probe was composed of the following composition 5 AC TTG TTG TTC CAT GTC TTG GCC TTG CAG GTG CAG GGC TTT CAG TTC GTA GGG GCC GGA CAT 3 . The oligonucleotide probe was chemically synthesized by triester method as detailed by Sood et al., After chemical synthesis has been completed, the 5 ends of the oligonucleotide probes were labeled with ³²P. To facilitate labeling, the 5 ends of the oligonucleotide were synthesized with OH termini, thereby eliminating the phosphatese treatment which typically must be employed when labeling DNA fragments. The labeling protocol included adding 1 ul of the synthetic oligonucleotides to 16 ul of ³²P ATP 3000 ci mM , 1 ul 10 U of T4 polynucleotide kinase and 2 ul of 10 x kinase buffer I. The 10 x kinase buffer I was composed of 0.5 M Tris Cl pH 7.6 , 0.1 M MgCl₂, 50 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM spermidine and 1 mM ETDA. The reaction was carried out at 37 C for 30 minutes, and thereafter the synthesized oligonucleotides were extracted with phenol chloroform. The labeled probes were separated from unlabeled oligonucleotides by chromatography on or centrifugation through Sephadex G 50 columns Pharmacia Fine Chemicals . To facilitate initial screening of the cDNA library prepared in Example 9 above, the transformed bacteria cultures were pooled into groups each having approximately 2,000 transformants different clones. Plasmid DNA was removed from samples of the host bacteria by standard alkaline lysis method detailed by Ish Horowicz and Burke, 9 Next, the plasmid digests were fractionated by electrophoresis through 0.8 agarose gel with markers of appropriate size. The agarose gel was blotted onto nitrocellulose filter using the standard method described by Southern, The bound DNA was next hybridized with the labeled oligonucleotide probes. Briefly, the baked nitrocellulose was presoaked in 6 x saline sodium citrate SSC 20 X SSC is composed of 175.3 g of NaCl and 88.2 g of sodium citrate in 800 ml of H₂O, with pH adjusted to 7.0 with 10N NaOH and then incubated at 50 C for 2 4 hours in prehybridization buffer composed of 6 x SSC, 0.5 NP40 detergent, 0.1 sareosyl, 5 x Denhardt s solution 0.02 Ficoll, 0.02 polyvinyl pyrrolidone, 0.02 BSA and 100 ug ml denatured salmon sperm DNA Sigma Type III, sodium salt . The filter was then incubated overnight at 50 C with the ³²P labeled oligonucleotide probe 10⁶ cpm ug from Example 3 in hybridizing solution as above. After overnight hybridization, the filter was washed extensively with 6 x SSC at room temperature and then for 5 minutes at 50 C with 6 x SSC. After air drying, the filter was subjected to autoradiography at 70 C. From the autoradiography, applicants found several hybridizing bands. The pool of clones from which the plasmid DNA that produced the hybridizing bands was plated out and then used in direct bacterial colony hybridization on nitrocellulose paper with the labeled oligonucleotide probe under the same hybridizing conditions as above. By this process, a single positive colony was identified. Plasmid, designated as IL 1 X 14, was prepared from the identified positive colony by the procedures set forth in Example 10. Samples of the IL 1 X 14 plasmid transformed into By this procedure, applicants have partially mapped the restriction sites, as shown in FIGURE 3, of the IL 1 X 14 plasmid in the region of the IL 1 gene. The numbers shown between the restriction sites of the gene correspond to the approximate distances between the sites, in base pairs. The DNA segment shown in FIGURE 3 was sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method essentially as described in the Amersham Handbook, The synthetic universal primer 5 CCCAGTCACGACGTT 3 P L Biochemicals, Milwaukee, Wisconsin , was annealed to the single strand DNA templates and used to prime DNA synthesis upstream and downstream from a location between nucleotides 476 and 477 FIGURE 4 as described above at page 19. Thereafter, the extension fragments were size separated by gel electrophoresis and autoradiographed from which the nucleotide sequences of the fragments were deduced. Three additional primers were employed to prime synthesis from intermediate locations along the sense strands of the DNA segment in FIGURE 4. A primer having the composition 5 CTGGAGAGTGTAGATCC 3 , corresponding to nucleotides 671 through 688 FIGURE 4 , was used to prime synthesis of the sense strand in the downstream direction from nucleotide No. 688. The composition of this primer strand was established from the sequencing information previously obtained by use of the universal primer. A second synthetic primer of the composition 5 GATATAACTGACTTCAC 3 corresponding to nucleotides 851 through 868 in FIGURE 4 was used in sequencing the sense strand in the downstream direction from nucleotide No. 868. A third primer having the sequence 5 GATTCGTAGCTGGATGC 3 corresponding to nucleotides No. 235 through No. 218 was employed to sequence the antisense strand in the upstream direction from nucleotide No. 218. By the above walk down method, both strands of the plasmid cDNA in FIGURE 3 were sequenced in an overlapping, redundant manner thereby confirming their nucleotide sequence. It is to be understood that other synthetic primers could have been employed to initiate chain extensions from other locations along the strands without departing from the scope of the present invention. The above primer strands were chemically synthesized by triester method as detailed by Sood et al., Deoxyadenosine 5 alpha ³⁵S thio triphosphate hereinafter dATP alpha ³⁵S was used as the radioactive label in the dideoxy sequencing reactions. Also, rather than using the gel set forth at page 36 of the Amersham Handbook, a 6 polyacrylamide gel was employed 6 polyacrylmide gel, 0.4 mm thick, containing 7 M, urea 100 mM Tris borate pH 8.1 , and 2 mM EDTA . As noted above, the nucleotide sequence of the plasmid DNA in FIGURE 3 is illustrated in FIGURE 4. This segment of DNA was found to include the region of the IL 1 gene coding for mature IL 1. The nucleotides are numbered from the beginning of the DNA segment in FIGURE 4. The corresponding amino acids, as determined by the nucleotide sequence and by protein sequence analysis, are set forth above the appropriate codons. The amino acid composition of the IL 1 gene extends from the mature NH₂ terminus of the IL 1 molecule, i.e., the Ala residue, as marked with an arrow in FIGURE 4 from which the numbering of the amino acid residues begins , to the Ser residue No. 153 immediately preceding the termination codon TAA. Various restriction enzyme cleaving sites are also indicated in FIGURE 4. The coding region of the IL 1 gene in FIGURE 4 is illustrated as a boxed section in FIGURE 3. Amino acid sequence studies of IL 1 were conducted according to the method of Stern et al., The coding region of the IL 1 gene was removed from the cDNA clone of FIGURE 3 and then inserted into the pY ADH shuttle vector to form the recombinant expression plasmid pY ADH IL 1. The restructuring scheme for preparing the pY ADH IL 1 shuttle expression vector is shown in FIGURE 5. This plasmid was amplified in A major portion of the coding region of the IL 1 gene from the Hpa II site base 457 in FIGURE 4 to the 3 flanking region of the gene was removed from the cDNA plasmid segment illustrated in FIGURES 3 and 4 by use of the Hpa II and Pst I restriction enzymes in the standard protocol set forth in Maniatis et al., A synthetic oligonucleotide was chemically synthesized to add back the 5 terminal portion of the coding region of the IL 1 gene and also to create a translation initiation codon at the 5 end of the coding region. The composition of the oligonucleotide, as shown in Table II below, includes an Eco RI cohesive 5 terminal followed by an ATG initiation codon and then the 5 end of the coding region of the IL 1 gene to the Hpa II site . Although the oligonucleotide shown in Table II was chemically synthesized by triester technique as detailed by Sood et al., Also, rather than cleaving the coding region of the IL 1 gene at the Hpa II site, the plasmid cDNA in FIGURE 4 could be cleaved at a restriction enzyme site in the 5 flanking region of the gene. Thereafter, the nucleotides of the flanking region can be sequentially removed by standard techniques. The pY ADH shuttle vector was prepared for ligation to the synthetic oligonucleotide and the excised major portion of the coding region of the IL 1 gene by digestion of the vector to completion with the restriction endonucleases Eco RI and Stu I by standard techniques, as set forth in Maniatis et al., As shown in FIGURE 5, the synthetic DNA oligomer, the excised major portion of the coding region of the IL 1 gene and the desired linearized pY ADH fragment were ligated together in a reaction mixture composed of 100 ug of the pY ADH vector fragment Eco RI Stu I , 40 ug of the major IL 1 cDNA fragment Hpa II, Pst I blunt , 5 ug of synthetic oligonucleotide Eco R I Hpa II , 1 ul of T4 DNA ligase and sufficient T4 ligase buffer 0.4 M Tris pH 7.4 , 0.1 M MgCl₂, 0.1 M dithiothreitol, 10 mM spermidine, 10 mM ATP and 1 mg ml BSA to form a 20 ul reaction volume. The reaction was carried out by incubation at 15 C for 15 hours. The resulting recombinant plasmid, designated as pY ADH IL 1, was then transformed into The amplified pY ADH IL 1 plasmid, as prepared above, was then employed to transform the protase deficient yeast strain 20B 12 The yeast cells were then concentrated by resuspending in 20 ml of SED 1 M sorbitol, 25 mM ETDA pH 8.0 , and 50 mM, dithiothreitol and incubated for 10 minutes at 30 C. The cell buffer mixture was then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 300 X g. The pellet was washed once with 200 ml of 1 M sorbitol and the cells resuspended in 20 ml of SCE 1 M sorbitol, 0.1 M sodium citrate pH 5.8 , 0.1 M ETDA . Glusulase, to break down the cell walls, in an amount of 0.2 ml was added to the solution and then the solution incubated at 30 C for 30 minutes with occasional gentle shaking. The presence of spheroplasts was assayed by diluting 10 ul of yeast cells into a drop 5 sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS wt. vol. on a microscope slide to observe for ghosts at 400 X phase contrast. The cell mixture was then centrifuged at 300 X g for 3 minutes. The resulting pellet was twice washed with 20 ml of 1 M sorbitol. The pellet was then washed once with STC 1 M sorbitol, 10 mM CaCl, 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 . The yeast spheroplasts were then transformed with the previously prepared plasmid vector in a procedure adapted from Beggs, 275 Thereafter, the protoplast DNA mixture was plated in the presence of yeast minimal medium containing 1.2 M sorbitol and 3 agar at 45 C and without tryptophan. The minimal medium was composed of 0.67 Difco yeast, Nitrogen Base, 0.5 casamino acids, 2 glucose. By maintaining the protoplast DNA mixture in this medium, only transformants survived, i.e., those that contained the Trp 1 gene. Prior to biological assay, the transformants were inoculated from the minimal medium into rich medium 1 yeast extract, 2 peptone, 2 glucose and grown at 30 C for 15 20 hours until the late exponential phase. At the time of harvest, the protease inhibitor phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride PMSF was added to 1 mM. The culture was then centrifuged at 400 X g to pellet the cells. Thereafter, the cells were washed once in 0.1 vol. cold H₂O. For breakage, the cells were resuspended in 0.01 vol. cold H₂O containing 1 mM PMSF and vortexed with glass beads 1 3 vol. for 2 minutes. The cell debris and glass beads were pelleted by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was found to exhibit IL 1 activity. This was ascertained by utilizing the supernate in both of the thymocyte proliferation and IL 1 conversion assays, discussed above. It will readily be appreciated that alternative sections of the IL 1 gene shown in Figure 4, which sections contain the coding region of the gene, also can be expressed. To this end, the pY ADH IL 1 plasmid can be digested with StuI and Eco R1 restriction endonucleases to remove the particular portion of the IL 1 gene identified above, thereby resulting in the original pY ADH plasmid. Thereafter, another section of the IL 1 gene can be ligated to the pY ADH plasmid by standard techniques, as set forth in Maniatus et. al., supra at 104.
