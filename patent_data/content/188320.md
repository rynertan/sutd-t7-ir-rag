# Electrolytic cell for sea water.

## Abstract
An electrolytic cell 1 whereby sea water is electrolyzed to form an aqueous hypochlorite solution with reduced formation of interfering deposits on the electrodes. The cell comprises a plurality of electrolytic cell units 4 having a pair of cathodes 6,6a and an anode 5 placed between the cathodes, an electrolyte inlet 8 at the lower part of an end frame 2 , and an electrolyte outlet 9 at the upper part of an end frame 2a . One of a pair of cathodes has an aperture 10 at a position corresponding to the inlet 8 , and the other cathode has an aperture 11 at a position corresponding to the outlet 9 . The anode has apertures 12 at the position corresponding to the inlet and outlet.
