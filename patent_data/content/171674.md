## Abstract
The electronic apparatus particularly suitable for processing, memorising, utilising and returning electrical signals and coded messages, comprises essentially two sections A, B , the first A constituting a self contained, self powered information unit provided with circuits for the reception of coded messages via wire and or via the ether, decoding circuits for said messages, and monitoring circuits and or circuits for automatically checking correct operation, the second B constituted essentially by a plurality of different units B1, B2, B3, B4 to which, singularly and or simultaneously, the first section A can be connected for the transfer, processing, recording and utilisation of the signals provided by said section A in relation to the specific function to be performed, and for the deactivation of said section A .
