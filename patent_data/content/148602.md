# TRANSFER LAMINATION OF CONDUCTIVE METAL LAYERS

## Abstract
Conductive metallic layers which are substantially continu ous and pin hole free are adhesively bonded to a dielectric support e.g. epoxy glass prepreg by using a transfer laminate. The transfer laminate comprises a release coated carrier film, a metallic layer and an adhesive. After being bonded to the support, the carrier film is stripped therefrom to bond the metallic layer to the support. In fig. 1 a transfer laminate comprises a carrier film 11, a release coating 12 bonded to one side of the carrier film, an adherent metal layer 13, and an adhesive layer 14.
