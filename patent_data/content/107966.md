# Load cell and method for its manufacture.

## Abstract
The load sensitive element 2 of a load cell 1 is provided with reduced thickness portions 5b, 6b for endow ing the cell with flexibility, and a strain gauge 7 is bonded to each reduced thickness portion. A deposited aluminium tape or film 8 comprising a substrate and a deposited aluminium layer provided on the substrate, is bonded over each strain gauge 7 by using an adhesive, thereby covering each strain gauge with a deposited aluminum layer to protect the strain gauge against moisture.
