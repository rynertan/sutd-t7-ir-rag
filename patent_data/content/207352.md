# Probing control method and apparatus for mechanism with multiple degree of freedom.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for probing control for use in aligning an object, the apparatus comprising a mechanism 6 ,7,8,9 having n degrees of free dom and adopted for controlling the object 1 n pieces of actuators 11,12,13 for actuating the mechanism detecting means 14 for detecting change in the output from the object 1 in response to the operation of each actuator 11,12,13 and control means 15 for computing a command for each actuator 11,12,13 in accordance with a change in the output detected by the detecting means 14 and amount of move ment of the mechanism 6 7,8,9 , and for controlling each actuator 11,12,13 in accordance with the command such that the output from the object 1 takes the maximum value.
