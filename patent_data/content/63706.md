# TANDEM DRIVE AXLE SYSTEM

## Abstract
An improved tandem drive axle system is of the type which is capable of supplying input torque from a vehicle power source to first and second rear drive axles and a front drive axle. The input torque is divided through a differential gear set to allow power to be transmitted from one of the side gears thereof to the second rear drive axle. An output gear associated with the other side gear is capable of transmitting at least a portion of the output torque therefrom to a first gear which is operably coupled to the first rear drive axle. An idler gear is also in driving engagement with the output gear and, in turn, drives a second gear which is selectively coupled to the front drive axle to transmit the remainder of the output torque from the output gear. If the second gear is selectively uncoupled from the forward drive axle, the idler gear and the second gear are allowed to free run.
