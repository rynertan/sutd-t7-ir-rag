# CASSEGRAIN ANTENNA FOR TVRO APPLICATION

## Abstract
An antenna is of the Cassegrain type with a main reflector, subreflector and horn, all circularly symmetric. The horn is corrugated and profiled with the near field focal point of the feed deep within the horn. The main reflector and subreflector are shaped in accordance with the horn pattern to optimize the energy distribution over the aperture of the main reflector. The subreflector, horn, and superstructure of the main reflector may all be of plastic molded construction.
