# Row sensing apparatus for a crop harvester.

## Abstract
A forage harvester 11 , pulled via its tongue 16 by a tractor, has dividers 19, 21 between which a crop row 18 is received, and each divider 19, 21 has a row sensing unit 41, 43 bolted to it. The crop row passes between a pair of arms 47, 48 of the unit. An arm 47, 48 is deflected when the machine is misaligned with the row 18 , the arm 47, 48 having an upright pivot shaft 79 which turns with it. The shaft 79 carries an actuator plate 95 which closes a switch 145 to trigger a guidance control circuit 45 to steer the harvester by way of a piston and cylinder 33 moving the tongue 16 to return the harvester to alignment with the crop row 18 . A housing 149 is provided for covering the switch 145, 147 and the top of the pivot shaft 79 . The switch 145, 147 is mounted on a floor 151 of the housing 149 . The pivot shaft 79 extends through the floor 151 and is partly surrounded by a first wall 153 of the housing, the wall 153 opening toward the switch 145, 147 . The housing 149 has a removable cover 157 which completes the enclosure of the switch 145, 147 .
