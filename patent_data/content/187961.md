## Description
The present invention relates to a satellite scrambling communication network using georgraphically separated uplinks to provide scrambled video and audio signals and descrambling control data to separate individual subscribers and to separate TV distribution systems. From EP A 0 099 691 a method for encrypting a line scanned television signal and an encrypting and decrypting apparatus are known in which each line of the signal has a first period during which video information is present and a second period where no video information is present and in which said television signal is encrypted in accordance with an encryption key including line storage by varying the durations of at least some of said second periods to both increase and decrease the same in accordance with said encryption key, the extent of variations in the durations of said second period being such that over a predetermined period of time the total of increases in said durations equals the total of decreases in said durations. This document shows control data in the form of an encryption key which is a part of a satellite transmission. Although an encryption key at the transmitter and a decryption key at the receiver are disclosed, it is not mentioned that such key is distributed by satellite, let alone by additional satellite uplinks. From WO A 8301881 a security system for SSTV encryption is known in which the distribution of a decryption key is made by satellite. From GB A 2 132 860 a conditional access broadcast transmission system is known in which the receiver includes a descrambler circuit which is enabled by descrambler control signals received from a conditional access sub system. The descrambler control signals are derived from off air control data signals by a decryption circuit responsive to a key. The key is formed in each receiver in a matrix by combining a personal identification number with a conditional access sub system code read from a respective store. The appropriate code is selected by further broadcast data. Alternatively, a pre payment or direct debit accounting system can be used. It is the object of the present invention to provide a satellite scrambling communication network of the afore mentioned type in which a business control center provides a master data stream which is used to control the descrambling of television signals at multiple individual subscribers and to control geographically separated satellite uplinks so that the uplinks may separately communicate their signals to affiliate cable systems and to the multiple individual subscribers. This object is attained by the features, of Claim 1. Preferred embodiments of the invention are made the subject matter of the dependent claims. The invention makes it possible to transmit the master data stream controlling both the individual subscribers and the uplinks to the satellite by one uplink, which master data stream is then transmitted by the satellite to all of the other uplinks, regardless of geographic location, with each of the uplinks adding its own supplementary data to control its own cable affiliates. Furthermore, one satellite uplink may transfer the master data stream and individual geographically separated uplinks may provide supplementary data to control their own cable affiliates. With the invention, it is possible that an entire network be controlled from one place and with geographically separated uplinks, each of which is adding supplementary television channels. This is different from the prior art in which use of a satellite for secure television comnunication is disclosed and in which transmitting the encryption key may be made via satellite or other means, e.g. by mail or by code cards purchased at respective retailers and adapted to be inserted in a decoder and comprising the key for enabling the decoder to make the received TV signal readable. The invention will now be further explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. The invention is illustrated diagrammatically in the following drawings wherein The present application relates to the distribution of premium television communications and specifically to a satellite communication network in which premium television programs, voice and data communications normally with the video signal scrambled and the audio and data encrypted, are transmitted to multiple individual subscribers by a communication satellite and to cable television distribution systems which will then distribute such signals to subscribers over cable or microwave facilities. Although the following description will use the phrase television communications, this is meant to include broadly video, voice and data communications from many sourcces, and also to include addressable secure communication systems. At the present time there is a vast number of cable systems throughout the United States which transmit over a variety of channels, such TV communications network programs, locally originated programs and premium programs, such as movies or the like, which are supplied to the cable systems by commercial programmers. Each of the premium programmers rents or owns a transponder on one or more of the available communication satellites so that the one or more channels transmitted from the programmer by its uplink can then be received by one or more of the cable systems geographically separated around the country. In effect, each premium programmer has an uplink by which it communicates to a communication satellite so that its affiliate cable systems may receive the premium programming for distribution to cable customers. Although we use the term cable, it should be understood that this also includes microwave and other types of distribution systems. The control of the television channels by the premium programmer is such that only those affiliate or cable systems associated with the programmer or those who pay to receive the service can receive and properly decode the scrambled signals. This system works satisfactorily, without any central control, but it does not provide any central supervision whereby individual subscribers may directly receive premium programming from a satellite and there are many individual subscribers who are in locations where there is no access to cable facilities or who may be unwilling to subscribe to a cable system and pay the consequent monthly rental fee when they are only interested in premium programming such as movies and special events. Accordingly, there is a very substantial market for direct communication of television communications to individual subscribers or individual network members. At the same time, there is a need for controlling and coordinating the distribution of signals by satellite to provide a more cost efficient communication network. The present invention provides a means whereby from a centrally located control center, a master data stream is provided to control the access of individual subscribers or subscriber groups or networks to all of the premium programming which may be available on any one or all of the uplinks geographically separated around the United States. The master data stream is also used to provide a means for control of the individual uplinks, each one under the control of a specific premium programmer so that the individual uplinks can provide restricted access to those cable systems which desire their service. In effect, the master data stream controls the individual subscribers, their addressing and encryption codes and thus decoding of premium program signals from all of the uplinks around the country. The master data stream also allocates channels for the programmer uplinks to prevent overlap and conflict between channels. The master data stream is supplemented by each premium programmer to an extent that permits such premium programmer to control its own cable system affiliates. Thus, one network combines a plurality of television communication channels, as many as 50 or more, from a variety of geographically separated uplinks, each one separately controlled by a premium programmer, to enable a combination of this vast array of television communications to be available to individual subscribers around the country and to be independently and separately available to various cable systems. In Figure 1, the business control center is indicated at 10 and includes a master control computer which will have address information, video scrambling codes and encryption data for each of the home subscribers who are equipped to receive signals from the satellite diagrammatically illustrated at 12. The type of scrambling system may vary widely and one appropriate system for the scrambling of video and audio signals is that disclosed in U. S. Patents 4,424,532, 4,353,088, 4,340,906, 4,336,553, 4,323,922 and 4,112,464. Other types of audio and video scrambling and encryption systems may also be used, but the above patents disclose a system now used by the assignee of the present application. At the control center 10 master control computer 14 provides the master data stream which, as illustrated in Figure 2, will include the encryption keys and associated address information for all of the home subscribers, and a tiering control or channel allocation for all of the geographically separated uplinks. The master data stream will be sent to a master encoder 16 which may be physically located at one of the geographically separated uplinks, in this case, an uplink designated uplink A. Uplink A will provide an input to the master encoder of one or more TV channels, as well as providing supplementary control data, which will enable the cable affiliates served by uplink A and which subscribe to its premium programming, to receive and utilize the scrambled television communications broadcast by uplink A. Uplink A has an affiliate control computer 18 which provides the supplementary data to the master encoder where the affiliate control data is combined with the master data stream and then transmitted by an antenna 20 at uplink A to communication satellite 12. As illustrated in the time diagram of Figure 2, the master data stream includes the common encryption keys which will be sent directly to the individual home subscribers, tiering control or channel allocation signal, and subscriber control and address information. The tiering control or channel allocation signal will provide for each of the individual uplinks to add supplementary data for control of their individual affiliate cable systems. As illustrated in Figure 2, uplink A has a time slot A wherein its supplementary data may be added. What is transmitted from antenna 20 of uplink A is the master data stream, the supplementary data stream from uplink A and the TV channels normally broadcast from uplink A to the communication satellite. The master data stream includes address and decoding control information whereby each individual home subscriber or subscriber network receives what premium programming it desires to receive and is willing to pay for. This may include the TV communication channels broadcast by any one or all of the various uplinks and this distribution is controlled by the master data stream provided by the business control center, which master data stream is sent to the satellite by uplink A. An antenna 22, diagrammatic represents one subscriber s antenna and the antenna is connected to a receiver decoder 24 which in turn is connected to the subscriber s television receiver 26. Thus, the receiver decoder of each individual subscriber will be controlled by the master data stream so that a particular subscriber may descramble and decrypt those television channels which it has agreed to pay for. The information transmitted from antenna 20 of uplink A to the communication satellite is also received by the antennas of geographically separated additional uplinks, indicated at 28 and 30. Each of these antennas may represent an uplink which may be located in any part of the United States and which will use communication satellite 12 to broadcast television communications to affiliate cable systems. The uplink associated with antenna 28, designated uplink B, includes a repeater decoder 32, an affiliate control computer 34 and an encoder repeater 36. The signal received by antenna 28 is that transmitted by uplink A antenna 20. The repeater decoder 32 removes the TV signals from uplink A and passes the master data stream to encoder repeater 36. The supplementary address and authorization data for uplink B is provided by affiliate control computer 34 to encoder 36. The TV channels allocated to uplink B and its supplementary data will be sent from encoder repeater 36 to the antenna for broadcast to the satellite so that the premium channels of uplink B can be available to its affiliate cable systems and to those home subscribers who are willing to pay for it. Thus, the signal received from the satellite by those uplinks other than the uplink transmitting the master data stream use the received data stream to control channel allocation. Each uplink supplements the master data stream with the control signals necessary to control access of the cable systems which can receive and utilize the premium programming broadcast by a particular uplink. As shown in Figure 2, there is a time slot for the supplementary data from each uplink. The supplementary data streams from each uplink may be as shown in Figure 2 and such may be transmitted in channel or out of channel. In the alternative, the master and supplementary data streams may use designated lines in the vertical blanking interval or in the horizontal blanking interval. In one system lines 7 and 8 of the vertical blanking interval may be used by each uplink to communicate with its affiliates and lines 1 5 of the vertical blanking interval may be used for the waste data stream to transmit address and decoding information to individual subscribers. In another alternative, the master and supplementary data streams may be carried by a subcarrier of either the video or audio signal. There may be as many uplinks as there are available transponders on the satellite and these uplinks may be at any geographical location within the United States. The master data stream provides the control for the individual subscribers and controls the channel allocation of the individual uplinks which themselves are controlled by particular premium programmers. Each of the uplinks adds its own supplementary data for use by its affiliate cable systems so that only those television communications desired by a specific cable system will be received and utilized by it. A typical community cable system is indicated generally at 40 and includes an antenna 42 and a plurality of receivers 44, one designated for each of the uplinks. With each receiver there is a decoder 46 which is to decode the signals from a particular uplink. Thus, a cable community affiliate may receive programs from all of the premium programming uplinks or from as few such uplinks as it desires. What is received by each cable system 40 is controlled by the supplementary data added at each of the uplinks.
