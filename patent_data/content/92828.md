# Fuel injection control apparatus for internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
A fuel injection control apparatus for controlling the amount and the timing of fuel injection with the said of a microcomputer 102 includes a hot wire type flow sensor 24 for detecting an instantaneous intake air flow velocity within an intake air passage 6 of an internal combustion engine. The output signal of the hot wire type flow sensor 24 is sampled at every predetermined crank angle or at every predetermined time point to be stored in a RAM 106 . The time at which the instantaneous velocity of the intake air flow within the intake passage 6 becomes maximum is detected. The fuel injection timing of a fuel injection valve 12 disposed in the intake passage is so controlled that the fuel injection is terminated around the time point at which the instantaneous intake air flow velocity is maximum.
