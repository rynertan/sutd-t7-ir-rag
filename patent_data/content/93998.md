# Photoradiator.

## Abstract
A photoradiator 10 in the form of an elongate light conducting member 12 is formed with at least one strip of light diffusing material 14 , spiral groove or annular groove, which serves as light radiating means. Light L input into one end of the light conductor is routed therethrough to be radiated radially outwardly of the light conductor by the radiating means. Despite a small diameter and flexibility of the light conductor, the grooves, either spiral or annular, are formed accurately and efficiently with the light conductor held stable in position. The light radiation efficiency is in creased by a flat reflector 16 located at the other end of the light conductor, the pitch p of the radiating means which progressively decreases toward the other end of the light conductor, and or, in the case of grooves, the depth of the radiating means which progressively increases toward the other end of the light conductor. A protective casing 18 hermetrically encloses the periphery of the light conductor at a spacing therefrom.
