## Description
This invention relates to an improved structure for continuously distributing hot water evenly across the top face of a fill assembly in a crossflow water cooling tower. Evaporative water cooling towers conven tionally include a heat exchanging fill assembly which gravitationally receives a stream of hot water to be cooled by flow of ambient derived air there through. Within the fill assembly, air is brought into sensible heat exchange relationship in a manner to effect the most efficient cooling of the water possible considering factors such as overall tower cost, pumping head of the water to be cooled, the water temperature range for the particular applica tion, geographical sites of the tower. The means for inducing air flow may comprise a natural draft, hyperbolic tower structure, but, more commonly, a motor driven fan is utilized because the hyperbolic tower requires a large amount of space as well as capital outlay. Moreover, the fan can be selective ly controlled to operate only when needed to main tain the necessary air flow through the tower in relation to the air and water temperatures, whereas the natural draft tower, in contrast, must be sized for all ambient temperatures to which the tower will be subjected. Mechanical draft cooling towers often are arranged in partitioned cells. The fill assembly of each cell is arranged in a pair of opposed, upright banks supported by tower framework, and each cell typically has a single, horizontally disposed fan which overlies a plenum between the banks. Hot water to be cooled is delivered through piping to a distribution basin which overlies each bank of fill assembly. Subsequently, the water exits the basin in the form of a plurality of streams or sprays gravitationally delivered from metering nozzles or discharge orifices in the basin bottom and which impinge on the upper adjacent face of the fill assembly for break up into droplets or division into films for more effective heat transfer. Finally, the cooled water is gathered in a cold water collec tion reservoir underlying the fill assembly for ultimate return to the point of use. It is the functional objective of the distribution basin provided in conventional towers to receive the incoming stream of hot water and direct the same toward all of the metering nozzles such that the latter are then operable to equally discharge the water evenly over the top face of the underlying fill assembly. Water flow rates within the tower can be on the order of 1,000 to 10,000 gallons a minute or more. Depending on overall tower size, the upper face of the fill assembly may be of such horizontal dimensions that some of the metering nozzles are disposed at significant dis tances from the inlet pipe supplying the hot water. The flow rates of this magnitude applied to an open top distribution basin of simple, U shaped construc tion results in a steady state water depth being shallower near the pipe inlet than adjacent the ends of the basin, when it is assumed that the metering nozzles are of equivalent diameter and spaced at uniform intervals. Furthermore, the kinetic energy of the water discharging from the pipe often is of such a magnitiude that very turbulent hot water basin flows are experienced, possibly resulting in loss of water due to splashing. Also, turbulent flows cause unsteady water levels in the basin such that the static head applied to each nozzle is variable, rendering the nozzle discharge flow rate uneven, if not substantially unpredicatable. Furthermore, high velocity flows over the nozzles can reduce nozzle flow rates and increase uneven water distribution. In an effort to distribute the incoming hot water to all of the metering nozzles equally, prior art cooling towers have occasionally been provided with a distribution basin having an up standing, centrally disposed partition which, in turn, has an upper weir edge. The partition has a longitudinal axis parallel to the elongated sides of the basin, and nozzles are located in the basin bottom on both sides of the partition. In opera tion, the incoming hot water is directed toward one side of the weir such that the chamber bounded by the partition and an adjacent basin side operates as a flume to carry water throughout the length of the latter. As the flume fills with water, the latter overflows the weir and spills into the remaining areas of the basin. As can be appreciated, water levels in this type of flume are higher than the water levels in the remainder of the basin. Con sequently, the metering nozzles in the bottom of the flume are subjected to a higher static head than the remaining nozzles in the basin and, to compensate for this head difference, nozzles within the flume are typically provided with a smaller opening than the nozzles in the remaining basin areas. However, such compensation requires extensive mathematical calculations for proper nozzle sizing under ideal water flow rates. Additionally, when the tower is operating under a reduced water flow such mathemati cal compensation is in error, often resulting in a portion of the nozzles receiving all or a signifi cantly larger proportion of the hot water to the exclusion of a remaining portion of the metering nozzles. Obviously, such construction substantially reduces tower efficiencies. It has also been suggested in the past to provide a distribution structure wherein a flume is positioned externally of the basin in side by side relationship. However, location of such a flume on the inboard side of the fill assembly adjacent the distribution basin interferes with the air pathways through the central portion of the tower. By con trast, placement of such a side by side flume on the outboard side of the fill assembly adjacent the basin interrupts the clean, aesthetically pleasing lines of the tower wall. In either case, this type of flume requires an additional, extensive support structure and, by necessity, thereby increases the overall size and cost of the tower correspondingly. The hot water supply and distribution structure of the present invention overcomes the above noted disadvantages of the prior art by pro vision of a novel flume that is disposed substanti ally within and along the length of a distribution basin. The flume is operable to direct the incoming flow of hot water to all areas of the basin such that the static head of water is equal for each of the metering nozzles. In more detail, the flume is an elongated, U shaped, open topped water conduit provided with a plurality of legs which support the flume in spaced disposition from the bottom of the basin. Hot water is received within the flume in a central stilling chamber which is horizontally aligned with the flume but preferably is offset from the longitudinal axis of the same. Adjacent the stilling chamber, turbu lence of the water stream is reduced significantly due to 1 a relatively sharp, 90 change in flow direction as the water descends vertically from the control valve and then horizontally enters the stilling chamber, and 2 horizontal, 90 deflection of the flow stream as the latter exits the stilling chamber and divides into equal, opposite streams for subsequent movement toward either end of the flume. As the water travels longitudinally in the flume, the level rises therein until the water flows over a pair of weirs or sidewalls which extend horizontally along a substantial length of the flume. The weirs are operable to deliver the water into the underlying basin evenly and equally along the entire length of the latter whereby the basin water level is substantially uniform throughout. As a result, the metering nozzles which direct the water in the basin to the fill assembly are invari ably subjected to equivalent static head regardless of water flow rates, whereby each of the nozzles can be provided with equal effective openings. Advantageously, the legs of the flume are U shaped in cross section and moled integrally with the flume bottom so that each of the legs presents a chamber in communication with the remaining water retaining areas of the flume. The chamber in the legs impedes the flow of water in the flume, and thus further reduces turbulence such that near laminar conditions can be approached. Noteworthy is the fact that the distribu tion structure of the instant invention is disposed at substantially the same height as typical distri bution basins of prior art construction. Conse quently, pumping as well as piping costs are not higher than those incurred in past constructions. Furthermore, the flume is very easy to install and eliminates the necessity of engineering and building a partitioned basin having a vast number of varying sized nozzles. Referring now to Figs. 1 2, a mechanical draft crossflow water cooling tower is broadly designated by the numeral 10 and conventionally is partitioned into individually operable cells 11. The tower 10 includes a foundation 12 which supports a cold water collection reservoir 14 common to or for each of the cells 11. Internally, the tower has a framework 16 which surrounds a pair of spaced, opposed, outwardly inclined banks of fill assemblies 18 only one being shown , while external casing 20 is secured to the framework 16 except for an area in front of each of the fill assemblies 18 that defines respective opposed air inlets 22. Within each cell 11, air is drawn through opposed fill assemblies 18 and into a plenum 24, and thence is drawn upwardly by means of a fan 26 which is powered through a shaft 28 by a motor 30. An upright, venturi shaped cylinder 32 circumscribes the fan 26 and is positioned atop the tower 10 on a series of horizontal joists 34 of the framework 16. Hot water is supplied to each of the cells 11 through an upstanding pipe not shown which is connected at its uppermost end to a tee 36, viewing Figs. 1 2. One side of the tee 36 communicates with a control valve 38 while the opposite side of the tee 36 is connected to a horizontal pipe 40 that is, in turn, coupled at its opposite end to a control valve 42. Water discharged from the control valve 38, 42 subsequently enters distribution structures 44, 46 which horizontally direct the flow in even fashion for subsequent, uniform gravitational des cent through the fill assemblies 18 and toward the collection reservoir 14. As seen in Fig. 2, the distribution struc ture 44 on each side of the cell 11 is comprised of an elongated distribution basin 46 which extends horitzontally over the entire top face of the fill assembly 18. Referring to Figs. 4 and 5, the basin 46 is generally U shaped in transverse cross section and has a pair of spaced, parallel sides 48, 50 which are joined to a flat bottom 52. A plurality of discharge orifices or metering nozzles 54 are spaced at uniform intervals along the bottom 52 above the fill assembly 18 and each of the nozzles 54 is advantageously provided with an identical effective cross sectional opening. The distribution structure 44 also in cludes an elongated distribution flume 56 which extends horizontally the length of the tower cell 11, as illustrated best in Fig. 2. Referring to Fig. 5, it will be seen that the flume 56 overlies the basin 46 and is generally disposed within the confines of the latter. Furthermore, the longi tudinal axis of the flume 56 is parallel but offset from the longitudinal axis of the basin 46. The flume 56 includes a bottom panel 58 which interconnects a pair of spaced, opposed, upright walls 60, 62. Both of the walls 60, 62 terminate at their uppermost portions in opposed, outwardly curved edges or weirs 64, 66 respectively. Referring now to Fig. 6, the flume 56 is advantageously molded of a glass fiber reinforced synthetic resin material such as polyester with the bottom panel 58 being provided with a plurality of spaced, integral, elongated legs 68 that support the flume 56 in spaced disposition above the bottom 52 of the basin 46. The longitudinal axis of each of the legs 68 is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the flume 56. Each of the legs 68 is also generally U shaped in transverse, cross sectional configuration such that an elongated cavity 70 is defined therein which is in communication with a flume channel 72, the latter of which is bounded generally by the sidewalls 60, 62 and the portions of the panel 58 which are between the legs 68. Furthermore, a pair of holes 73 are disposed in a lowermost portion of each of the legs 68 in order to drain standing water in the flume 56 whenever oper ation of the tower 10 is halted. Each flume channel 72 communicates with a laterally adjacent stilling chamber 74 which is positioned below the outlet of a respective control valve 38 or 42. As shown in Fig. 4, the stilling chamber 74 has a leg 76 that is generally similar in shape to each of the legs 68. A cover 78, as shown in Fig. 4 6, is located over the stilling chamber 74 to confine water emerging from control valve 42. The cover 78 also extends over a central area of the flume 56 adjacent the chamber 74, but is elevated somewhat in this area to provide an escape for water overflowing a proximal portion of the weir 64. A shield or de flector 80 depends vertically from the elevated portion of the cover 78 to control splashing of water exiting from the stilling chamber 74. By way of comparison, Fig. 3 depicts a typical prior art distribution structure 90 which includes a basin 92 that is divided by an upstanding partition or weir 94 which defines a flume 96 and an adjacent outer basin or aqueduct 98. Both the flume 96 and the aqueduct 98 extend the entire length of the elongated basin 92 in disposition overlying a fill assembly not shown . A plurality of spaced apart nozzles 100 are located in a bottom portion of the flume 96, while a quantity of nozzles 102 are provided in a lower portion of the aqueduct 98. Additionally, a cover 104 extends across the flume 96 to retard excess splashing. In use, a continuous stream of hot water to be cooled flows out of the control valves 38, 42, necessarily adjusted to maintain equivalent water flow rates to each tower cell 11. As depicted by the arrows in Fig. 4, water exiting from the valves 42 descends into the stilling chamber 74 and subse quently enters the flume 56 whereupon the flow divides and substantially equal quantities of the water are sent in opposite directions along the length of the flume channel 72. After initial startup, the water fills the flume 56, then continually overflows above the weirs 64, 66 and spills into the basin 46. The horizontal nature and equivalent height of the weirs 64, 66 insures that the hot water will flow equally into the basin 46 along the entire length of the latter. Optionally, the sidewalls 60, 62 may be provided with vertically adjustable weir plates for the purpose of water management under reduced flow rate conditions. As depicted in Fig. 5, the water static head over each of the nozzles 54 will be equivalent, including those nozzles that are disposed beneath the lower panel 58. As such, all of the nozzles 54 throughout the basin 46 may be provided with equiva lent effective openings. In the prior art distribution structure 90 as shown in Fig. 3, the flume 96 occupies portion of the basin 92 and simultaneously directs water over the weir 94 while discharging water through the nozzles 100. Thus, the prior art basin 92 is hydraulically complex and to a degree unpredictable since the nozzles 100 in the flume 96 must be of an appropriate size so as to pass a certain percentage of the water to the underlying fill assembly as well as develop a high enough head over the weir 94 to convey a complementary percentage of water into the adjacent aqueduct 98. As such, the nozzles 100 by necessity must be provided with smaller openings than the nozzles 102. Unfortunately, engineering calculations to determine the openings of the noz zles 100, 102 must be based on a specified flow rate and, as a result, the distribution structure 90 can not direct water evenly to the underlying fill assembly when variable water flow rates are encoun tered, or such rates are above or below the rate for which the nozzles were especially sized. The flume 56 of the instant invention, in cooperation with the stilling chamber 74, is also operable to greatly dissipate the kinetic energy of the incoming water from the control valve 42. As seen in Fig. 4, the water exiting the valve 42 is confined by the cover 78 within the stilling chamber 74 while experiencing a sharp 90 angular deflec tion. Immediately downstream, the water enters the T shaped intersection of the flume 56 with the stilling chamber 74, whereupon one half of the flow is horizontally directed at a 90 angle toward the left while the remaining portion of the water is deflected 90 horizontally to the right. Further more, the cavity 70 in each of the legs 68 is oper able to also reduce turbulence in the flowing stream, whereby water in the flume approaches lamin ar conditions. Consequently, water exiting the flume 56 over the weir 64, 66 will be distributed evenly along the basin 46 by virtue of the fact that splashing and wave motion has been largely elimi nated. Also noteworthy is the fact that utiliza tion of the flume 56 within the basin 46 offers flexibility of design as well as construction. Specifically, the flume 56 having specified dimen sions may be utilized in a basin 46 of any width and may be easily retrofitted into existing towers. The flume 56 requires no expensive or extensive support structure and does not occupy valuable space within the plenum 24. Additionally, the provision of a stilling chamber 74 disposed laterally of the flume 56 enables identical distribution structure 44 to be utilized on both sides of the tower, regardless of the fact that the control valve 38 is, by necessity, positioned in a different orientaion than the control valve 42, as will be evident by reference to Fig. 2.
