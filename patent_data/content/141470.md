## Description
This invention relates to stable manganese adjuncts for use as a bleach catalyst, and to solid particulate bleaching and or detergent compositions comprising said adjuncts. In U.S. Patent 3,156,654 and European Patent Application 72166 there is disclosed that heavy metals not only catalyse peroxide decomposition but can also act under certain conditions to enhance the oxidising bleaching activity of peroxide bleaching agents. In European Patent Application N 0 082 563 there are described the outstanding properties of manganese as a bleach catalyst and its advantageous use in low to medium temperature bleaching and detergent compositions containing a carbonate builder. Catalytic heavy metal cations, when incorporated in bleaching and detergent compositions in conjunction with a peroxide bleaching agent, tend to cause bleach loss during storage due to possible catalyst bleach interaction. From internal experiments it has been established that in the case of manganese two problems can occur on storage as a result of manganese incorporation in fabric washing powder compositions containing a peroxide bleaching agent, i.e. In European Patent Application N 0 072 166 it is proposed to pre complex the catalytic heavy metal cation with a sequestrant and dry mix it in particulate form with the remainder of the composition for improving composition storage stability. It is further stated that the complex of catalytic heavy metal cation and sequestrant can be agglomerated in a matrix of pyrophosphates, orthophosphates, acid orthophosphates and triphosphates. Applicants have tested these methods and found none of them to be effective to overcome the above mentioned problems connected with manganese incorporation in fabric washing detergent compositions containing a peroxide bleach, especially when the detergent composition also comprises a carbonate builder, such as sodium carbonate. The above techniques of the art are ineffective to solve both the instability problem and the manganese dioxide formation in the pack. The procedure as described in EP 72166 has been copied with respect to manganese,, i.e. spray on of Mn EDTA complex onto sodium triphosphate. As expected, this material was not storage stable in a bleach containing detergent composition. Brown spots accompanied by rapid bleach loss were observed after storage for only 3 days at 37 C 70 RH in a laminated carton pack. It has now been found that a stable manganese adjunct which is particularly, but not exclusively, suitable and effective for use in carbonate built detergent bleach compositions without causing the above mentioned problems can be obtained by having a manganese II cation bound to a ligand forming either 1 a true complex compound, 2 a water insoluble salt compound or 3 an ion binding compound by adsorption, which compound is protectively coated with a matrix of water soluble or water dispersible material. Mixtures of ligands can also be used. Especially suitable are mixtures of zeolite and sodium tripolyphosphate. The protective coating for forming the matrix is a water soluble or water dispersible material and will generally have a melting point higher than 30 C, preferably higher than 40 C. Suitable protective coating materials may be selected from the group of organic homopolymers or heteropolymers, organic nonionic compounds, long chain C₁₀ C₂₂ fatty acids and fatty acid soaps, and the so called glassy sodium phosphates of the following molecular structure wherein the average value of n is from about 10 to 30. Examples of suitable organic homo or heteropolymers are modified starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinylalcohol, and sodium carboxymethylcellulose. Suitable nonionic compounds are for example polyethylene glycols having a molecular weight of from 1000 to 5000 C₁₅ C₂₄ fatty alcohols or C₈ C₁₂alkylphenols having from about 10 to 60 ethylene oxide units and the long chain fatty acid alkylolamides, such as coconut fatty acid monoethanolamide. The protective coating for forming the matrix of water soluble or water dispersible material can be applied by any suitable coating or encapsulation technique. As such can be named co spray drying spray cooling extrusion and any other granulation technique, for example by spraying a liquefied form of the water soluble or water dispersible material by melting or in aqueous dissolution onto a moving bed of manganese ligand compound particles, or by dispersing the manganese ligand compound particles in a solvent containing the protective coating material followed by solvent removal. The material comprising the protective coating may not only be incorporated in the coating layer, but may also find use as a component of the core. One of the problems that can be encountered during coating encapsulation is agglomeration of the powder particles. It was considered that this problem could be overcome by absorbing an aqueous manganese complex solution e.g. Mn EDTA on a porous support such as silica, zeolite or alumina. Coagulation of the adjunct particles during the subsequent coating step would thus be minimised, as the support would be capable of absorbing relatively large quantities of aqueous polymeric solutions or molten coatings. This technique will have the additional advantage of omitting the energy expensive spray drying step. Accordingly, the invention provides a manganese adjunct which can be safely and stably used as a bleach catalyst in built detergent bleach compositions comprising peroxide bleaching agent without causing bleach instability problems and the formation of MnO₂ in the pack or upon powder dissolution, in which the adjunct comprises a manganese II cation bound to a ligand forming a true complex compound, a water insoluble salt compound or an ion binding compound by adsorption, which compound is protectively coated with a matrix of a water soluble or water dispersible material having a melting point higher than 30 C, selected from the group consisting of organic homopolymers or heteropolymers, organic nonionic compounds, long chain C₁₀ C₂₂ fatty acids and fatty acid soaps and glassy sodium phosphates. Advantageously the matrix of water soluble or waterdispersible material forming the protective coating will comprise from about 5 to about 50 , preferably from about 30 to about 50 by weight of the adjunct. A preferred ligand is a water soluble complexing agent, highly preferred being those forming a particularly strong complex with manganese II having a stability constant of the Mn II complex greater than 10⁷, particularly greater than 10¹⁰ up to about 10¹⁶, such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid EDTA and diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid DETPA . Another preferred ligand is zeolite. Without wishing to be bound to any theory, it is believed that the need to complex or bind the manganese II cation with a suitable ligand is to prevent the release of Mn OH ₂ MnO₂ in the dispenser. A preferred protective coating material used for preparing the manganese adjunct of the invention is glassy sodium phosphate as hereinbefore defined, having an average value of n of about 10, which is also known as sodium hexametaphosphate or Graham s salt. This salt is for example, commercially available under the trade name of Calgon supplied by Albright Wilson. Other preferred protective coating are fatty acids and soaps. As already explained before, the manganese adjunct of the present invention can be used as a peroxide bleach catalyst in any type of detergent compositions, especially in carbonate built detergent compositions. Alternatively, the manganese adjunct of the invention may be presented in separate packages with or without a peroxide bleach and or a carbonate ion producing compound, e.g. in unit sachets or tea bag type packages, for use as a bleach additive in fabric washing processes. Accordingly, in another aspect of the invention a detergent bleaching composition is provided comprising from 2 to 99.95 by weight of a peroxide bleaching agent and a manganese adjunct as hereinbefore described in an amount such that the composition contains from 0.005 to 5 by weight of manganese II cation. The detergent bleach composition may further comprise a surface active detergent material which may be anionic, nonionic, cationic or zwitterionic in nature or mixtures thereof, in an amount of from about 2 to 40 by weight of the composition. Additionally, the composition may incorporate inorganic or organic detergency builders or mixtures thereof in amounts up to about 80 by weight, preferably from 1 to 60 by weight, and also other ingredients normally used in fabric washing compositions, including other types of bleaches and bleach activators as desired. A preferred detergent bleach composition will comprise a carbonate builder, a peroxide bleaching agent and a manganese adjunct as described hereinbefore. Examples of carbonate builders include sodium carbonate and calcite. Such compositions will normally comprise 1 50 by weight of a carbonate builder, 2 35 by weight of a peroxide bleaching agent an manganese adjunct in an amount of about 0.005 5 by weight expressed as Mn² Examples of peroxide bleaching agents include hydrogen peroxide adducts such as the alkali metal perborates, percarbonates, persilicates and perpyrophosphates, which liberate hydrogen peroxide in solution, the sodium salts being preferred. To ensure complete complexation, a 2 1 molar excess of EDTA was used and the EDTA acid partially neutralized with sodium hydroxide, both to reduce the slurry moisture content to about 40 by weight and to impart rapid dissolution properties to the final complexed product. The process involved adding sodium hydroxide 6 moles to an aqueous dispersion of EDTA acid 2 moles in a stirred crutcher. The slurry moisture content at this point was 40 and the pH 8.5. A solution of manganous sulphate 1 mole was then added and the whole was spray dried to yield a white water soluble powder containing about 6.0 by weight of Mn² In the same manner, manganese complexes were prepared with nitrilotriacetic acid NTA , diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid DETPA , diethylene triamine pentamethylene phosphonic acid DETMP , ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid EDTMP and trisodium nitrilotri methylene phosphonate. To recover the product, further drying may be applied by e.g. freeze drying or by rotary evaporation Although complexation of manganese by this route avoids the risk of brown staining on dissolution, severe storage problems were encountered when the above complex was stored in carbonate built detergent powder compositions containing a sodium percarbonate bleach. Complete bleach loss was observed after two weeks storage in non laminated packs at 37 C 70 RH see Figure 1 , and moreover it was accompanied by oxidation of the EDTA and release of the manganese to form MnO₂. In the absence of bleach the manganese complex is completely stable. Mn EDTA has been stored in a base detergent formulation in an open beaker for 12 months at 37 C 70 RH without any apparent degradation. Figure 1 shows percarbonate bleach losses in sodium carbonate built detergent powder compositions with Mn EDTA complex during storage conducted over 10 weeks at 37 C 70 RH curve I and 28 C 70 RH curve II , as compared to control powders without manganese catalyst at 37 C 70 RH curve III and 28 C 70 RH curve IV . 2 Three different routes for protecting the manganese complex were tried All three adjuncts dissolved readily in cold water and exhibited a manganese catalysed bleaching effect. The results of storage trials, conducted over 10 weeks at 37 C 70 RH and 28 C 70 RH in non laminated packs and polythene bags, showed that all three coating materials gave a considerable improvement in bleach composition stability over the unprotected controls. Figure 2 shows sodium percarbonate bleach loss in a sodium carbonate built detergent powder containing manganese adjunct i stored in non laminated packs curve I and polythene bags curve II conducted over 10 weeks at 37 C 70 RH. Figure 3 shows the results of storage trials conducted with manganese adjunct i similar to Figure 2, but at 28 C 70 RH curve I in non laminated packs and curve II in polythene bags. Figure 4 shows sodium percarbonate bleach loss in a sodium carbonate built detergent powder containing manganese adjunct ii stored in non laminated packs curve I and polythene bags curve II conducted over 10 weeks at 37 C 70 RH. Figures 5 and 6 show the results of storage trials conducted over 10 weeks with sodium carbonate built detergent powders containing sodium percarbonate bleach and manganese adjunct obtained from process iii at 28 C 70 RH and 37 C 70 RH, respectively, compared with control compositions without manganese catalyst. Curves I for compositions manganese adjunct curves II for control compositions without manganese catalyst . Storage trials with the manganese adjunct obtained from process iii showed that sodium percarbonate losses were very little if any more than with a manganese free control formulation at 28 C 70 RH see Figure 5 . In addition, no MnO₂ was observed even after ten weeks at 37 C 70 RH in a non laminated carton. The manganese EDTA complex of Example 1 1 was dried to a moisture content of less than 1 in an oven at 135 C. The original moisture level of the spray dried material varied from batch to batch and ranged from 0.8 to 6 . The complex 60 g was intimately mixed for 20 30 minutes in a rotating drum with 10 g of a fine grade of silica Gasil HPV ex Crosfields , which had a particle size of 75 µm. The resultant powder was transferred to a polyethylene beaker 2 litres , and covered with a sealing film layer to prevent adjunct loss during coating. A solution of sodium hexametaphosphate 15 g in 25 ml of demineralised water was sprayed onto the powder from a pressurised Humbrol paint sprayer, through a 4 cm diameter hole in the centre of the film. The beaker was rotated during this operation so that a thin continuous curtain of powder was always presented to the atomised glassy sodium phosphate solution. After coating, the product was spread out evenly on a flat tray and allowed to air dry and harden up over a period of four days. Coarse particles were removed after this period on a 1700 µm sieve. The final product had a moisture content of about 10 and contained about 4 manganese. Experimental evidence to date suggests that it is important not to heat the particles during coating or drying steps, as this could lead to increased perturbation of the outer layer and consequently to poor storage characteristics. The fine grade silica acts as a water sink and thus prevents excessive agglomeration of the complex particles during coating. Manganese adjuncts were prepared from the following manganese ligand combinations provided with different coating materials, The zeolite used was a 4A type and has an Al to Si ratio of 1 1 and an ion exchange capacity of 3.5.10 ³ moles of Mn² An aqueous solution of manganous sulphate tetrahydrate 22.3 g 0.1 moles was added with stirring to a solution of tetrasodium pyrophosphate decahydrate 22.3 g 0.05 moles in 200 ml of demineralised water. The resultant fine white precipitate was filtered under vacuum and washed with acetone. The crude pyrophosphate 15.6 g 92.3 yield was dispersed in demineralised water and heated to boiling point. This solution was then filtered hot so that the water soluble sodium sulphate impurity would be removed in the filtrate. The yield of manganous pyrophosphate after oven drying was 14.7 g 87 . Analysis indicated that the product was Mn₂P₂O₇ 3H₂O. An aqueous solution of MnSO₄ 4H₂O 5 x 10 ³ molar was added to a solution of sodium laurate 1.2 x 10 ² molar . The white precipitate formed on addition was filtered under vacuum, and washed with demineralised water and finally with acetone. Three coating materials were used i a soap, based on a 70 30 lauric oleic fatty acid mix ii hardened tallow fatty acid HTFA and iii coconut fatty acid ethanolamide CEA . All three coatings were applied in a similar manner. The manganese source 1 5 was dispersed in an organic solvent containing either soap, HTFA or CEA. The solvent was then removed under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator, leaving a dry white granular powder with a nominal coating to inner core ratio of about 30 70. 98 g of manganese EDTA granules 1 having an average particle size of 250 µm were dispersed in a solution of isopropyl alcohol water 95 5 300 ml and soap 42 g . The solvent was removed under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator, leaving soap coated Mn EDTA. The final traces of IPA water were co distilled with a small amount of acetone 100 ml . 140 g of manganese zeolite 3 containing approximately 1 manganese was dispersed in petroleum ether, hexane fraction, 300 ml and hardened tallow fatty acid 60 g . The hexane was removed under vacuum with a rotary evaporator. The last traces of hexane were again co distilled with acetone, leaving a dry white powder. Care was taken during the distillation step to ensure that the melting point of the fatty acid 56 C was not exceeded. 98 g of manganese EDTA granules 1 having an average particle size of 250 µm were dispersed in a solution of CEA 42 g in isopropyl alcohol 300 ml . The solvent was removed under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator, leaving CEA coated Mn EDTA. The final traces of IPA were co distilled with a small amount 100 ml of acetone. The storage stability of the adjuncts of Example V was assessed in two product formulations A and B . The rate of bleach sodium perborate monohydrate decomposition was monitored over a period of two months, and compared with a manganese free control. The products were stored at 37 C 70 RH and 28 C 70 RH in small 56 g wax laminated cartons. The results are shown in Tables 1 3. Stability of sodium perborate monohydrate in a carbonate base formulation A . Conditions 28 C 70 RH wax laminated cartons. Stability of perborate monohydrate in a carbonate base formulation A . Conditions 37 C 70 RH wax laminated carton. Stability of perborate monohydrate in product formulation B . Conditions four weeks at 37 C 70 RH and 28 C 70 RH, in wax laminated cartons. Examination of the products described in Tables 1 3 after storage did not reveal any powder discolouration, or darkening of the adjunct particles, except in the cases of the Optimisation studies indicated that a coating level of 30 by weight was near the lower limit for the organic coating material used in the tests. Reduction of the soap level to 25 on a manganese EDTA support resulted in a 66 loss of perborate after 4 weeks at 28 C 70 RH, whereas a 50 coating gave perfect protection under the same conditions see Tables 1, 2 and 3 . Bleaching experiments were carried out with powder formulations A , B and C containing manganese adjuncts of Example V, in a Tergotometer isothermal wash at 25 C, using water of 15 French hardness and a product concentration of 6 g l. Powder formulations without manganese adjunct and with a non coated manganese adjunct were used for comparison. The results are shown in the following Tables 4 6. Bleaching of standard tea stained test cotton with powder formulation A expressed as ΔR₄₆₀ Bleaching of standard tea stained test cotton with powder formulation B , expressed as ΔR₄₆₀ Bleaching of standard tea stained test cotton with powder formulation C , expressed as ΔR₄₆₀ The above results demonstrate that the presence of coating did not significantly affect the release of the Mn² Other manganese adjuncts according to the invention were prepared
