# Profiling grinding wheels.

## Abstract
A method of profiling a grinding wheel, containing a superabrasive e.g. diamond in a brittle bond, comprises rolling a profiled crushing roll against the working surface of the wheel and applying a hard wire e.g. steel brush to the working surface of the wheel as it rotates. The brush may be pneumatically loaded against the wheel and coolant applied to the working surface of the wheel at a place after that where the brush is applied but before the area of contact with the crushing roll.

## Description
PROFILING GRINDING WHEELS The invention concerns the profiling of grinding wheels containing superabrasives such as cubic boron nitride CBN or diamond. Such grinding wheels are part cularly useful for grinding profiles in components of such hard materials as hardened high speed steel ano tungsten carbide, especially where consistently high dimensional and geometric accuracy and maintenance of surface integrity are important. Grinding wheels having CBN or diamond in a brittle metallic bond are known and it is known to profile such wheels by use of a crushing roll, which may be of hardened high speed steel or tungsten carbide. To assist the profiling operation it is common practice to apply a dressing stick, e.g. of aluminium oxide, to the wheel to aid removal of bond material. The crushing time required for an initial profiling operation is usually quite long and typically involves the consumption of several dressing sticks and the crushing has to be discontinued each time a dressing stick is expended and replaced by a new dressing stick. According to the present invention a method of profiling a grinding wheel containing a superabrasive in 2 brittle bond comprises rolling a profiled crushing roll against the working surface of the wheel ano applying a hard wire brush to that surface as it rotates. The brush is thought to function in rather a different way from a dressing stick. rather than merely abrading the bond material it is thought that the brush actually breaks away bond material at the surface, already weakened by the action of the crushing roll. The use of the hard wire brush enables substantial advantages to be achieved as compared with the knawn practice of using a dressing stick. First, the brush can readily be so made that it is far more durable than a dressing stick and a single brush can serve for an entire profiling oper ion thereby avoiding the celays and work involved in changing dressing sticks during a profiling operation. Secondly, in addition to avoiding delays as just mentioned, the brush can actually function far more effectively than a dressing stick and thereby enable the time needed for a profiling operation to be considereably further reduced.Thirdly, because of the resilience o f the wires of the brush, quite. unlike a dressing stick, the wires can be flexed against the wheel and maintained in more effective contact than a dressing stick.Fourthly, because of the durability of the brush and the fact that suitable brushes ry be made inexpensively, costs can be reduced as ccr red with the use of dressing sticks, particularly as a single brush may remain in good condition for use in the re profiling of a wheel on a number of occasions. Fifthly, for a given profiling operation, less detritus results from the wearing down of the brush than from a dressing stick and in any event the detritus is less troublesome and easier to remove. The bond material in the wheel to be profiled may be metallic as in well kne brittle bonded CBN and diamond grinding wheels but the method of the invention is also applicable to wheels having other brittle bonds, in particular brittle vitrified bonds. The wires of the brush are preferably of hardened steel. The brush is loa ed against the wheel, with wires of the brush flexed against the wheel, so that wires of the brush advance into the wheel profile as it is created by means of the crushing roll and the wires are progressively worn down.The brush may be Icaded against the wheel by means of a spring or hydraulically but preferably the loading is achieve pneumati celly. lather than having the brush generally stationary, it may be rotatable t the wires extencing generally radially an In this case the brush is so driven as to cause relative movement at the area of contact with the wheel, preferably by driving the brush so as to move in the opposite direction to the wheel at the area of contact. Ignoring the fact that in use wires of the brush are to some extent flexed against the wheel, it is preferred that the wires should be generally racial in relation to the wheel at the area of contact. In the method it is greatly preferred that coolant should be applied to the surface of the wheel at a position after the place where the b rush Is applied bLt before the area of contact with the crushing roll. It is particularly preferred that the coolant should be applied under pressure as a jet, preferably generally counter to the direction of rotation of the wheel and preferably ststantially tangential to the wheel surface. In the method coolant is preferably also applied at the area of contact between the wheel and the crushing rzll ano coolant may be applied here at bot sides o, the contact area i.e. both where the wheel arid roll come tc5ether ano whEre they part The invention is further described with reference to the accompanying schematic drawing which shows an assembly as used in the method of the invention. In the drawing, grinding wheel 1 is the wheel being profiled and it contains CBN or diamond in a brittle bond. The grinding wheel 1 is forced against profiled crushing roll 2 of hardened high speed steel or tungsten caroioe and, as profiling progresses, is radially advanec towards the crushing roll. The crushing roll 2 is rotated about its axis and causes rotation of the grinding wheel 1 about its axis, the direction of rotation being indicated by arrows 3 and 4. Pressed against the grinding wheel 1 is a wire brush 5 having spring steel wires 6 thickness about 0.4 mm set in a block 7. The block 7 is removably held in a yoke 8 by means of bolts not shown and urged towards the grinding wheel 1 by piston rod 9 extenoing from pneumatic cylinder 10 mounted on support 11. By line 12 air at a controllable, known pressure may be supplied to the o lInder 10. As indicated schematically by arrowed line 13, coolant liquid is applied under pressure as a jet to the surface of the grinding wheel 1 at a place after passing the brush 5 but before the wheel surface reaches the place of contact with the crushing roll 2. At the place of contact between the girding wheel 1 and the crushing roll 2, coolant is applied as indicated by arrowed line 14. In the profiling of 2 new wheel, the brush 5 is inItially loaded relatively lightly against the wheel 1 e.g. using a pressure of 100 kFa 1 bar . As the wheel oevelops the desired profile and the brush is advanced, the brush acquires a corresponding profile, the area of contact between the brush and wheel increases ano a higher pressure e.g. 200 itto 300 kPa.may b used but not so high as to cause stopping of the wheel. The rate of advance of the brush towards the wheel is preferably about twice the rate of advance of the wheel towards the crushing roll. Once the wheel has the desired profile and the trash a ccrrespcnding profile, the brush can be usec again in subsequently re profiling the same wheel after it has undergone use and ceased to have the exact profile required. Alternatively, the used brush may be ground flat with an abrasive wheel and used again in profiling a different grinding wheel.
