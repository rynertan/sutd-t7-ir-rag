# Process for the immobilisation of microorganisms on a plastic carrier, a plastic carrier on which microorganisms have been immobilised and the use of it in biological reactors.

## Abstract
Process for the immobilisation of one or more hydrocar bon utilising microorganism on a plastic carrier in which the immobilisation is carried out in an aqueous nutrient medium to which a minor amount of a water immiscible hydrocarbon sub strate has been added. Further plastic carriers on which micro organisms have been immobilised and the use of the latter have been described.
