# Polymerizable 3 aroyloxyphenyl carbamates and methods for their preparation and use.

## Abstract
Novel polymerizable 3 aroyloxyphenyl carbamates such as 3 benzoyloxyphenyl 2 methacryloxyethylcarbamate form addition polymers which are useful as surface coatings for res inous especially polycarbonate articles. The coatings protect the resinous articles against discoloration as the result of ul traviolet radiation induced degradation and also may serve as primers for abrasion resistant coatings such as silicone hard coats.
