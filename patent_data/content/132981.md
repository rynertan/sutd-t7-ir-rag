# Hypotriglyceridemically active polysaccharides.

## Abstract
A hypotriglyceridemically active polysaccharide having the following characteristics a Specific rotatory power α D²⁹ 190.1 1.8 w v solution b Molecular weight by gel filtration 14,000 3,000 c Sugar composition weight percent by gas chromatography This hypotriglyceridemically active polysaccharide can be prepared by cultivating a microorganism belonging to the genus Streptococcus in an adequate culture medium there for and collecting the hypotriglyceridemically active polysaccharide from the cultured cells of the microorganism and or the supernatant of the culture broth. The present hypotriglyceridemically active polysaccharide can be used as an active ingredient of a hypotriglyceridemic or antithero sclerotic pharmaceutical composition together with phar maceutically acceptable carrier therefor to form a hypotrigly ceridemic or antiatherosclerotic pharmaceutical composition, which is suitable for oral administration to mammals.
