# Drag reduction agents for aqueous salt solutions.

## Abstract
The present invention involves the use of improved drag reduction agents for aqueous solutions which comprises a polymeric complex which is a terpolymer of acrylamide metal or amine styrene sulfonate methacrylamidopropy ltrimethyl ammonium chloride. MAPTAC . The metal stryene sulfonate is an anionic monomer, while MAPTAC is cationically charged. These acrylamide based polyampholytes have approximately 1 to 50 mole of the cationic moiety present within the macromolecular structure. These groups are not necessarily present in an equimolar charge ratio. The excess undissociated charge allows for facile dispensability or solubility of the polyam pholytes into fresh water.
