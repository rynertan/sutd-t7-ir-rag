## Description
SCPr INSTALLATIONS Previously proposed installations for emergency evacuation of a person or persons from an exit opening above a surface, for example an exit opening in a building, include a closure for an exit opening pivotable about a vertical axis between a closed position in which the closure closes the exit opening and an open position in which the closure opens the exit opening. An inflatable escape slide falls out of the closure on opening and is inflated frcm an inflation system arranged away from the closure. Such an installation has the disadvantage that the remote location of the inflation system makes installation difficult and that the underside of the inflated escape slide is, in the case of a fire in a building, exposed to heat from parts of the building beneath the escape slide. An object of the invention is to provide an escape installation for emergency evacuation of a person or persons which is self contained and therefore easily installed and which is readily used by evacuees. According to the invention, there is provided an escape installation for emergency evacuation of a person or persons from an exit opening above a surface, the installation comprising an escape slide assembly having a mounting for connection at or adjacent a lower edge of the exit opening to allow pivotal movement of the assembly about a horizontal or substantially horizontal axis between an open position and a closed position in which the escape slide assembly closes or sub stantially closes the exit opening, the escape slide assembly including an escape slide having inflatable side walls between which extends a slideway, the escape slide being uninflated in the closed position of the assembly, the installation being operable in emergency to release the escape slide assembly from the closed position, the escape slide assembly upon release, pivoting to the open position to open the exit opening, an inflation system of the installation being actuated on operation of the installation to inflate the escape slide and to deploy the escape slide thus providing a slideway extending from the exit opening to the surface beneath the exit opening, the initial length of the escape slide from the exit opening overlying the remainder of the open escape slide assembly. The following is a more detailed description of one embodiment of the invention, by way of example, reference being made to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is an elevation of an escape installation in a closed position and mounted over, and viewed from the exterior of an exit opening from a building, Figure 2 is a section on the line II II ofFigure 1, Figure 3 is a section on the line III III of Figure 1, Figure 4 is an elevation of the escape installation of Figures 1 to 3 in the closed position, the view being partially broken away and being from the interior of the exit opening, Figure 5 is a perspective view of the exit opening showing the escape installation of Figures 1 to 4 in an open position, Figure 6 is a side elevation of an inflated and deployed escape slide of the escape installation of Figures 1 to 5, and Figure 7 is an elevation of the inflated and deployed escape slide of Figure 6. Referring first to Figures 1 to 4, the escape installation comprises a fixed frame 10 and a movable escape slide assembly 11. The frame 10 is rectangular see Figure 1 is made from rolled steel members and is fixed securely in a corresponding rectangular aperture forming an exit opening 12 from a building 13. It will be appreciated that the frame can equally well be fixed in an exit opening in the side of a ship or in an exit opening in an aircraft or indeed any exit opening arranged above a surface. The escape slide assembly 11 comprises a casing 14 carrying at a lower edge thereof mountings 15 for the pivotal connection of the casing 14 to the frame 10 for movement of the casing 14 about a horizontal axis between a closed position, shown inFigures 1 to 4, and an open position, shown inFigure 5. In the closed position, a seal 16 provided along the vertical side edges and the top edges of the casing 14 seals against the building 13 to close the exit opening from the exterior see Figures 1 to 3 . As shown in Figures 3 and 4, a fabric cover connected to the upper edge of the casing 14 covers the interior face of the casing 14. The casing 14 is held in the closed position by a latch 18 see Figure 4 which can be released by an operating handle 19, normally enclosed in a breakable giass case not shown to prevent inadvertent operation. The casing 14 includes a recess holding a package 20 containing a folded, deflated escape slide, described in more detail hereinafter. The recess also holds two side screens 21 and a safety strap 22 whose construction and operation are also described in more detail hereinafter. Further, an inflation system for the escape slide is carried in the recess and comprises a cylinder of compressed gas 23 connected to the packaged escape slide through an operating head 24. In use, in an emergency such as a fire in the building, the glass of the casing around the handle 19 is broken using a small hammer provided adjacent the handle 19. The handle 19 is then pulled to release the latch 18 and allow the casing 10 to pivot under the off centre weight of the slide package 20 see Figure 3 . The two side screens 21 are triangular in shape each side screen 21 has one edge connected to a vertical side edge of the frame and another side edge connected to the adjacent vertical side edge of the casing 14. The safety strap 22 has an end connected to each screen at a point adjacent the vertical sides of the frame 10 and midway between the top and bottom of the frame 10. A further strap 25 Csee Figure 7 is connected between the safety strap 22 and a Velcro Trade Mark strip 26 closing the package 20. Thus, as the casing 14 opens, the side screens 21 are pulled from the recess and the safety strap 22 deploys across the exit opening 12 to prevent passage through the exit opening see Figures 5 and 7 . The movement of the package 20 away from the safety strap 22 causes the further strap 25 to pull open the Velcro CTrade Mark strip 26 thus opening the package 20. At the same time, the opening of the casing 14 causes the cover 17 to be thrown away from the casing 14 to uncover the package 20. The side screens 21 limit the opening of the casing by their dimensions and they also serve to decelerate the casing 14 by their wind resistance.Further deceleration is achieved by break ties 27 provided on the screens 21 which part under the load imposed by the falling casing 14. In this way, the casing 14 is halted in the open position shown inFigure 5. As the casing 14 halts, the inertia of the packed deflated escape slide 28 throws the escape slide 28 out of the open package 20 and over the outerrst edge of the casing 14. This movement of the packaged escape slide 27 pulls a lanyard not shown connected between the escape slide 21 and the operating head 24 to withdraw a slug Cnot shown in the operating head 24 and open the gas cylinder 23. Should th s lanyard not function, a manually operated lanyard not shown is provided for withdrawing the slug. The 7ithdrawal of the slug allows gas under pressure to pass fro the cylinder 23 through a hose 29 and a pressure regulator Cnot shown to aspirators mounted on the escape slide 28. The high pressure gas passing through the aspirators induces further external air to enter the escape slide 28 to inflate the escape slide 28 to its working pressure. The escape slide 28 is packed to ensure that it is positioned correctly in front of the exit opening 12. This correct positioning is assisted by a strap not shown which passes around the deflated slide and remains in position until sufficient pressure is attained in the escape slide during inflation to part a break tie in the strap to allow the slide to deploy with sufficient momentum to ensure correct positioning of the inflated escape slide on the ground. Referring to Figures 6 and 7, the escape slide 28 comprises inflatable side tubes 30 between which is stretched a slideway 31, having deceleration patch 32 adjacent the ground. When the escape slide 28 is fully inflated, the safety strap 22 is removed and a person or persons evacuate the building by sitting on the slideway 30 and sliding down the slideway 30. The side screens 21 are made from a fire retardent material to protect an evacuee from smoke and flames and they also serve to stabilize the escape slide 28 in high winds. The cover 17 is also a fire retardent material and the casing 14 and the cover 17 hanging from the end of the casing in the open position protect the underneath surface of the escape slide 28 from heat. The height of the side tubes 30 together with the side screens 21 provide psychological reassurance for reluctant evacuees. The deceleration patch 32 slows evacuees before they reach the ground.When the installation described above with reference to the drawings is installed in a building, it may be installed in an existing door aperture or in a specific prepared position. The frame 10 may be placed in any position in a building which allows access to the ground, such as a balcony, roof or wall.
