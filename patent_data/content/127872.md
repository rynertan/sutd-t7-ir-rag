# Arrangement for the treatment of a moving material web.

## Abstract
Arrangements for the treatment of a moving material web by means of an air flow are used for example in the packaging industry for the drying of packing material in web shape. In this process the web passes through a chamber provided with inlet and outlet for the air, and at high air velocities the web is affected in an undesirable manner so that an uneven, unstable movement is imparted to it. In the arrangement in accordance with the invention this is avoided by means of a baffle plate 9 placed at an angle in relation to the web between the web 4 and the outlet 8 which causes a partial vacuum which balances the web and gives it a calm and steady movement through the chamber 1 .
