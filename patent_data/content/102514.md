# Adjustable chain anchor for lift trucks.

## Abstract
The lift system for the mast assembly of a lift truck normally includes at least one hydraulic cylinder and a pair of lift chains for selectively raising and lowering a movable assembly upright or carriage assembly on a fixed upright assembly. The tension in the lift chains must be precisely set and periodically adjusted by use of an adjustable anchor, including a bolt threadably mounted on the fixed upright assembly and connected to the chain. Space limitations in present day mast assemblies have dictated the need for an adjustable chain anchor that is compact and is designed to be conveniently mounted on an upper end of the fixed upright assembly for ready access. The adjustable chain anchor 19 of this invention solves this problem by provid ing a cam member 26 adapted to be rotated to adjust chain tension in response to selective rotation of an end of the chain 17 about a fixed pivot axis A .
