# Process for preparing amino acids and their esters.

## Abstract
An improved process is described for preparing amino acids with high optical yield, the process being based on an initial asymmetric hydrogenation of a suitable olefin unsaturated prochiral or raceme compound for example alpha acetamido cinnamic acid in the case of L N,acetylphenylalanine, in the presence of a catalyst constituted by a compound of a transition metal with asymmetric aminophosphines, in particular a rhodium complex. The hydrogenation reaction is followed by treating the final product with a solvent mixture constituted by an alcohol and a halogenated hydrocarbon, which favours the removal of the catalyst residue and simultaneously increases the optical yield of the required amino acid. The invention also provides for the preparation of amino acid esters from the corresponding N acylamino acids without the intermediate separation of the relative amino acid. The transformation takes place in a single step which comprises the deacylation of the amino group and the esterification of the carboxyl function, in the presence of a catalyst.

## Description
This invention relates to an improved process for preparing amino acids or their derivatives, the process comprising an initial asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral or raceme olefin unsatursted compounds in the presence of a catalyst constituted by a compound of a transition metal with asymmetric aminophosphines, followed by treating the final product with a suitable solvent mixture constituted by sn alcohol and a halogenated hydrocarbon.The industrial preparation of optically active organic compounds with a high degree of optical purity, such as levorotatory amino acids, is still almost exclusively carried out by biochemical or microbiological processes.Up to a few years ago, no purely chemical methods were known which in terms of process economy and optical efficiency could complete with the aforesaid methods, these latter demanding rigorous procedures and careful monitoring in relation to the final purification.However, the discovery of new homogeneous catalytic systems of high stereospecificity and the considerable developments in the synthesis of asymmetric phosphines have led to the preparation of chiral transition metal complexes having good stereoselectivity in the hydrogenation of prochiral olefins.For example, U.K. Patent Nr. 1.580.461 granted on February 11, 1981 describes a new class of optically active compounds which are very useful in the asymmetric hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds. The said application relates to a particular class of amino derivatives of phosphorus of formula PR1 ER K in which x in R1 is alkyl, arylthio, alkylphosphino, arylphosphino, aminophosphino or the like x varies from 0 to 2 and NOR 2 are optically active groups deriving from amino compounds. These compounds constitute a large category of mono and polydentate binders able to coordinate transition metals and thus form compounds capable of asymmetrically hydrogenating prochiral or raceme olefins suitable transition metals include Ru, Rh, Pt, M Fe, Ti and V amongst others.According to this patent application, the hydrogenation reaction is carried out at a molar ratio of substrate to catalyst which varies between 10,000 and 10, and at a temperature of between 70 and 200 0C. The applicant has now discovered that which constitutes the subject matter of the present invention, namely that it is possibly to considerably improve the optical yield of the aforesaid asymmetric hydrogenation reactions if this reaction is followed by special treatment of the obtained product with a suitable solvent mixture which, in addition to favouring the removal of any catalyst residues, leads to a considerable increase in the optical efficiency of the preceding hydrogew ation reaction.The present invention therefore firstly provides a process for preparing optically active amino acids, consisting of a preliminary asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral and raceme olefin unsaturated compounds in the presence of a catalytic system constituted by a transition metal compound, followed by treating the obtained product with a mixture comprising at least one alcohol and at least one halogenated hydrocarbon.Any transition metal compound known for this purpose can be used for carrying out the preliminary hydrogenation, even though the use of compounds described in the aforesaid patent has proved particularly advantageous. Likewise, said process is valid for preparing every type of amino acid and its respective derivatives, but because of the great economical and commercial interest, the applicant has considered it useful to stress the preparation of L phenylalanine and its derivatives. It will however be simple for the expert of the art to extrapolate the necessary conditions for preparing other amino acids, and the present invention is applicable to all the different initial substrates concerned.If amino acid derivatives are to be prepared, the amino acid can be easily obtained by well known routine reactions.Thus, as stated the asymmetric hydrogenation reaction is carried out in the presence of a transition metal compound known for this purpose. The reaction is carried out in particular in the presence of a complex of a transition metal with asymmetric aminophosphines chosen from those satisfying the formula PR1 NR2R3 x 3 x in which R is an alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, alkylthio, arylthio, alkylphosphino or aminophosphino group x varies from 0 to 2 R2 and R3, which can be the same or different, can be an alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, arylalkyl or cycloalkyl radical, at least one of the two containing one or more non raceme chiral centres in the particular case of phenylalanine, the use of rhodium complexes has proved advantageous.The hydrogenation reaction is carried out in an alcoholic solvent at a temperature of between 700 C and 2000C, with a molar unsaturated substrate .catalytic complex ratio exceeding 10, and variable up to and well beyond 20,000.The reaction mixture obtained in this manner, and comprising the required product, the solvent and catalyst, can be treated so as to separate the product, this latter then being treated with a special solvent mixture consisting of at least one alcohol an one hydrocarbon, or alternatively this latter can be added to the alcoholic mixture originating from the introductory asymmetric hydrogenation reaction.To obtain the required effects, i.e. removal of the catalyst residue which is as complete as possible together with increase in the optical yield, the ratio of the alcoholic component in the mixture to the hydrocarbon component must be kept between 1 1 and 1 50, the optimum ratio being related to the concentration of the raceme substance.The present invention also provides a method for optically enriching a given amino acid, comprising treating this latter with a solvent mixture consisting of at least one alcohol and one halogenated hydrocarbon in a molar ratio varying from 1 1 to 1 50, refluxing this mixture, cooling it, then filtering off the solid product and washing it with the halogenated hydrocarbon. Alcohols which can be used include all low boiling alcohols, particularly ethyl alcohol, and the halogenated hydrocarbon can be advantageously chosen from those having a low number of carbon atoms, such as chloroform or methylene chloride.The applicant has also found that amino acid esters can be prepared from the corresponding N acylamino acids in a single stage without previously separating the intermediate. The direct transformation which is possible in this way comprises deacylation of the amino group and esterification of the carboxyl function, with considerable advantages both from the operational and from the overall yield aspects. The general scheme is as follows EMI5.1 where R R R1, H, alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl etc.n 0, 1, 2, 3 etc. Hx Bronsted or Lewis acid.The reaction is carried out in the presence of an acid catalyst, and from the reaction scheme it is apparent that the alcohol in the presence of the acid catalyst performs the double role of esterifying agent reaction A and solvolysis agent reaction B .The entire method of operation will be apparent from the following examples, which however in no way limit the scope of the present invention, which is of completely general application.EXAMPLE l The synthesis of L phenylalanine will be described, this taking place by the following series of reactionsEMI6.1 tb SEP NHCOCH SEP Gat SEP NHCOCH tb CH CZ SEP H2 SEP CH2 CH tb SEP COOH SEP COOH tb EMI6.2 The catalyst used in the hydrogenation stage is RhPNNP Diene X whereRh is rhodium PNNP N, N,N bis R methylbenzyl N,N bis diphenylphosphino ethylenediamine can be C104 , PF6 , or BF4Diene is norbornadiene NBA or cyclooctadiene COD .a Preparation of alpha acetamidocinnamic acidA mixture consisting of 58.5 g 0.5 moles of acetylglycine, 30 g 0.37 moles of anhydrous sodium acetate, 79 g 0.74 moles of freshly distilled benzaldehyde, and 134 g 1.25 moles of 95 acetic anhydride are dissolved in a suitable flask of 1 litre capacity.

EXAMPLE 2 50 g 0.241 moles of N acetylphenylalanine of optical purity are sre dissolved in 400 ml of anhydrous methanol. The resultant solution is cooled to OOC with ice and treated with 30 g of anhydrous hydrochloric acid gas. 29.4 g 0.277 moles of acetone dimethyl acetal are then added to the solution, and the resultant solution heated under reflux in a fractional distillation apparatus. The solution is kept at temperature for 20 hours, during which 70 80 ml of the solvent are removed periodically by fractional distillation.In this manner, the methyl ester of the acetic acid which forms as a result of reaction B is removed from the reaction medium, as is the acetone resulting from the reaction between acetone dimethyl acetal and the water which forms as a result of reaction A. In this manner, the equilibrium of both reactions is advantageously displaced in the required direc tion.The Llphenylalsnine hydrochloride is isolated by evaporating the solvent, and the incorporated hydrochloric acid is removed by dissolving plus evaporation carried out four times with 50 ml portions of methanol each time. In this manner 47.8 g of L.phenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride are obtained with an optical purity equal to that of the starting substance. Yield 93 .EXAMPLE 3 31.5 g 0.241 moles of Nlacetyl Llalanine are reacted with 300 ml of anhydrous ethanol and 25 g of HC1 gas in the manner described in example 1, but without adding acetone dimethyl acetal0In this case, both the water formed in accordance with reaction A and the ethyl acetate formed in accordance with reaction B are directly removed as such as a result of the formation of the ternary azeotrope with ethanol.In this manner, 33.3 g of L alanine ethyl ester hydrochloride are obtained with a yield of 90 .EXAMPLE 4 28 g 0.24 moles of Nlacetylglycine in 250 ml of anhydrous methanol are reacted with 25 g of anhydrous HC1 gas in the manner described in example 1. 27 g of glycine methyl ester hydrochloride are obtained, with a yield of 89 . EXAMPLE 5 100 g 0.843 mol of N acetylphenylalanine having an optical purity of 97 are dissolved in 800 mls of methanol. There are added thereto 100 g of H2S04 96 purity, density 1.83 and the solution is refluxed.Refluxing is continued for 25 hours during which provision is made to recover, by azeotropic distillation with methanol, the methyl ester of the acetic acid as it is formed, this operation being carried out periodically. By so doing, the reaction equilibrium B page 2 is quantitatively shifted towards the right, whereas the water as formed by the reaction A is bound by the sulphuric acid which is present in the reaction medium. On completion of the reaction, the volume of the solution is reduced to one sixth of its original volume. Neutralization is made with aqueous ammonia until a pH of 9 is obtained. The aqueous solution is thrice extracted with dichloroethane using a 200 ml portion each time. In the organic phase, which is cooled to OOC with an ice bath, anh. gaseous hydrogen chloride is caused to bubble. The hydrochloride of the L phenylalanine which has thus been formed, is collected on a filter, washed with bichloroethane and dried.There are obtained 92 g of product, the optical yield being 99 .The yield is 89 of the theory.
