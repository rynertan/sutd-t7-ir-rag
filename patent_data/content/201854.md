# Ring laser angular rate sensor.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a ring laser angular rate sensor having a plurality of intersecting bores 12 in a block 10 . The in tersecting bores are sealed by mirror assemblies 14 via a thermally formed hermetic seal. Furthermore, electrodes 16, 18, 20 also are connected to the block 10 via thermally formed hermetic seals.
