## Description
DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS HAVING T2ROVED BLT5ACIJINC EFFECT This invention relates to detergent compositions1 and, in particular, to detergent compositions adapted for fabric washing. It is known that laundry compositions function more efficiently in soft water than in water containing significant amounts of dissolved hardness cations such as calcium ion, magnesium ion and the like. Zeolites or other cation exchange materials were frequently used to pre soften water. Such pre softening procedures require an additional expense to the user occasioned by the need to purchase the softener appliance. The most usual means whereby fabrics can be optionally laundered under hard water conditions involves the use of water soluble builder salts and or chelators to sequester the undesirable hardness cations and to effectively remove them from interaction with the fabrics and detergent materials in the laundering liquor. The most efficacious material of this type has been sodium tripolyphosphate and this builder has been in almost universal use during the last ten years. However, the use of such water soluble builders, especially phosphates, introduces into the water supply certain materials which, in improperly treated sewage effluents, may be undesirable. Accordingly, a means for providing water softening builders in detergent compositions without the need for such large quantities of soluble builder additives is desirable. Avariety of methods have been suggested for providing builder and water sofloniong action concurrently with the washing cycle of a home wundering operation, but without the need for water soluble detergent additives. One recently developed method for removing water heidness cations in detergent solutions invelves the use of certain water insoluble synthetic aluminonilicates in detergent compositions. A multitude of patent applicatiions have appeared in recent years relating to these materials.Among these can be mentioned British Patent SpecificationsNo.1,429,143 No.1,473,201 and No.13,473,202 GermanOffenlegungsschriften No.2,259,685 and No.2,532,501 Dutch Patent Application No. 75,11455 U.S. Patent No.3,985,669 and Belgian Patent No.835,492. Despite the advances which have been trade in replacing phosrte builders by aliminosilicate materials, it is in practice found that detergent compositions built with aluminosilicates are still deficient in a number of areas of detergency performance compared with the commerical phosphate built detergents of today. One such area of deficiency is in the field o oxidizable stain cleansing. In part this deficiency would appear to reflect the poorer peptizing ability of aluminosilicate materials.Also of importance, however, is the fact that aluminosilicates and perbleach components such as perborates, can interact antagonistically, thereby reducing the bleaching effectiveness of compositions containing these materials, The essence of the present invention lies in the discovery that compositions hased on certain crystalline aluininosilicates and having specifically defined low levels of polyphosphonate sequestering agents and specific in use pH characteristics, have excellent all round detergency performance and especially good cleaning performance on oxidizable type stains. Moreover, these benefits are delivered in the absence of per bleach components so that the invention makes it possible to reduce or to eliminate such materials entirely. Furthermore, unlike traditional compositions based on per bleach materials which have optimum effectiveness at a pH well above the optimum pH 8 to 9 of convention enzyme components, the instant compositions have optimum bleach effectiveness at about the same pH as these enzyme materials making it possible to secure excellent bleaching and enzyme performance from a single composition. Polyphosphonates have already been suggested for use in detergent compositions containing aluminosilicate. For example,German Offenlegungsschrift 2,544,035, 2,539,071 and 2,527,388, all disclose the use of various polyphosphonates notably as dispersing agents in aluminosilicate built products. However, it appears that the usefulness of polyphosphonates in improving bleachable stain performance in low pH aluminosilicate built products has not hitherto been recognized. Accordingly, the present invention provides a detergent composition comprising a from 2 to 75 of a surfactant selected from anionic, nonionic, zwitterionic and amphoteric surfactants and mixtures thereof b from 5 to 60 of a water insoluble crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange material of the formula Mz A102 z SiO2 y X H20 wherein M is a calcium exchange cation z and y are integers of at least 6 the molar ratio of z to y is in the range from 1.0 to about 0.5 and X is an integer from about 15 to 264 said aluminosilicate ion exchange material having a particle size diameter from about 0.1 to about 10 microns c from 0.01 to 4 by weight of a polyphosphonic acid or salt thereof, and d a pH regulating agent in an amount such that a 1 aqueous solution of the detergent composition has a pH in the range from 7.0 to 9.5. Tile various essential and optional components of the composition of the invention will now be discussed.Organic Detergent The detergent active component of the present compositions can be anionic, nonionic ampholytic or zwitterionic in nature or can be mixtures thereef. The detergent compositions of the invention contain the active system in an amoumt of from about 2 to about 75 by weight. For solid granular composition, the active system is generally in the range from about 4 to about 30 , more, preferably from about 6 to about 15 of the compositionsIn liquid compositions, higher active contents, for example about 20 to about 70 are normally employed.

Soaps can be intde by direct saponification of fats and soils or by neutralization of free fatty acids. Particularly useful are tlie sodium and potassium salts of the mixtures of fatty acids derived from coconut oil and tallow,ie. sodium or potassium tal low and coconut soap. A highly preferred cis of anionic detergents includes water soluble salts, particulary the alkali metal, ammonium and alkylolammonium salts, of organic sulfuric rcactioll products having in their molecular structure an alkyl group containing from about 8 to about 22, especially rom about 10 to about 20 carbon atoms and a sulfonic acid or sulfuric acid ester group.

Such nonionic surfactants are preferred from the point of view of providing good to excellent detergency performance on fatty and greasy soils, and in the presence of hardness sensitive anionic surfactants such as alkyl benzene sulphonates. The preferred surfactants are prepared from primary alcohols which are either linear such as those derived from natural fats of prepared by the Ziegler process from ethylene, eg. myristyl, cetyl, stearyl alcohols , or partly branched such as the Dobanols and Neodols which have about 25 2 methyl branching Dobanol and Neodol being Trade Names of Shell or Synperonics, which are understood to have about 50 2 methyl branching Synperionic is a trade name of I.C.I. or the primary alcohols having more than 50 branched chain structure sold under the Trade Name Lial by Liquichimica.

Mixtures of any of the foregoing phosphonic acids and or salts can be used in the compositions of this invention.Methods of preparing these classes of materials are described in U.S. Patent No. 3,488,419. For the purpose of this invention, it is preferred that the polyphosphonates are free of hydroxyl groups. Another useful and preferred class of polyphosphonates are the amino poly alkylene phosphonates , particularly those having the general formulaEMI12.1 wherein n is anintegral number from 0 to 14, and each R is individually hydrogen or CM2P03H2 or a water soluble salt thereof, provided that at least half of the radicals represented by R are CH2PO3H2 radicals or water soluble salts thereof. Especially preferred is the polyphosphonate having the general formula EMI13.1 wherein each R1 is CH2PO3H2 or a water soluble salt thereof and m is from 0 to 2. Examples of compounds within this class are aminotri methylenephosphorlic acid , ethylene diamine tetra methylenephosphonic acid and diethylene triamine penta methylene phosphonic acid .Of these, ethylene diamine tetra methylene phosphonic acid is the most beneficial and is preferred. Preferred polyphosphonates can also be defined in terms of their calcium and iron sequestering ability as reflected in their calcium and iron logarithmic stability constants, PKCa and pKFe3 . These are defined by reference to the equilibrium.EMI13.2 where M is the metal cation and A is the polyphosphonate anion predominating in aqueous solution at the in use pH of the detergent composition. The equilibrium constant is therefore Km and pK log10 KPreferably, the polyphosphonate has a PKCa of less than about 6, more preferably less than about 5 and especially less than about 4. The value of pKF 3 , on the other hand is preferably greater than about 6, more preferablyqreater than about 9, and especially greater than about 12. Literature values of stability constants are taken where possible, see Stability Constants of Metal Ion Complexes, SpecialPublication No 25, the Chemical Society, London .Otherwise, the stability constant is defined at 250C and at 0.1 molar KCl, using a glass electrode method of measurement as described in Complexation in Analytical Chemistry by Anders Ringbcm 1963 The pH Regulating Agent The pli rogulating agent can be selected from inorganic or organic acids or cid salts or mixtures of such materials. A preferred inorganic agent is sodium or potassium bicarbonate.Suitable organic agents include lactic acid, glycoilic acid and ether derivatives thereof as disclosed in Belgium Patents S21t36S, 821,39 and 821,370 succinic acid, malonic acid ethylenedioxy diacetic acid, maleic acid, diglyollic acid, tartaric acid, tartronic acid and fumar.c acid citric acid, aconitic acid, citraconic acid carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, lactoxysuccinic acid, and 2 oxa 1,1,3 propane tricarboxylic acid oxydisuccinic acid, 1,1,2,2 ethane tetracarboxylic acid, 1,1,3,3 propane tetracarboxylic acrid and 1,1,2,3 propane tetracarboxylic acid cyclopentane cis, cis, cis tetracarboxylic acid, cyclopentadienide pentacarboxylic acid, 2,3,4,5 tetrahydrofuran cis, cis, cis tetracarboxylic acid, 2,5 tetrahydrofuran cis dicarboxylic acid, 1,2,3,4,5,6 hexane hexacarboxylic acid, mellitic acid, pyromellitic acid and the phthalic acid derivatives disclosed in British Patent 1,425,343 and the acid salts of the above organic acids. Of the above, the preferred organic acids are citric, glycollic and lactic acids. The pH regulating agent is present in an amount sufficient to provide a pF in 1 aqueous solution of the detergent composition, in the range from about 7 to 9.5, preferably from about 7 to 9, especially from about 7.5 to 8.5. Generally, from about 5 to 25 , especially from about 10 to 20 of the regulating agent is sufficient for this purpose.The Aluminosilicate Builder The aluminosilicate ion exchange materials used herein are prepared by a process which results in the formation of materials which are particularly suitable for use as detergency builders and water softeners.Specifically, the aluminosilicates herein have both a higher calcium ion exchange capacity and a higher exchange rate than similar materials previously suggested as detcrgency builders. Such high calcium ion exchange rate and capacity appear to be a function of several interrelated factors which resuit from the method of preparing said aluminosilicate ion exchange materials. It is highly preferred that these ion exchange builder materials are in the sodium form . A second essential feature of the ion exchange builder materials herein is that they be in a hydrated form ie. contain 10 to 28 , preferably 10 to 22 of water. Highly preferred aluminosilicates herein frequently contain from about 18 to about 22 water in their crystal matrix. It has been found, for example, that less highly hydrated aluminosilicates, eg. those containing about 6 water, do not function effectively as ion exchange builders when employed in the context of a laundry detergent composit ion. A third essential feature of the ion exchange builder materials herein is their particle size range. Proper selection of small particle sizes results in fast, highly efficient builder materials. The method set forth below for preparing the aluminosilicates herein takes into consideration all of the foregoing essential elements. First, the method avoids contamination of the aluminosilicate product by cations other than sodium. For example, product washing steps involving acids or bases other than sodium hydroxide are avoided. Second, the process is designed to form the aluminosilicate in its most highly hydrated form. Hence, high temperature heating and drying are avoided. Third, the process is designed to form the aluminosilicate materials in a finely divided state having a narrow range of small particle sizes. Of course, additional grinding operations can be employed to still further reduce the particle size. However, the need for such mechanical reduction steps is substantially lessened by the process herein. The aluminosilicates herein are prepared accoraing a dis olv sodium aluminate Na AlO2 in water to homogen add solution b add sol hydroxide to the sodium aluminate solution add water a at a weight ratio of NHO2 Na AlO2 of1 1,8 preferred maistain the temperature of the solution at about 50 C untill allthe NaOH dissolves and a homogeneour solution fea c add soddium silicate Na2 SiO3 having a SiO2 Na2O weight ratio of 3.2 to 1 to the solution of step b to provide a solution having a weight ratio of Na2SiO3 NaOH of 1,14 1 and a weight ratio of Na2SiO3 NaAlO2 of 0,63 1 d heat the mixture prepared in step c to about 90 C 100 C and maintain at this temperature range for about one hour. In a preferred ambodiment, the mixture of step c is cooled to a temperature below about 25 C, preferably in the range from 17 C to 23 C, and maintained at that temperature for a period from about 25 hours to about 500 hours, preferably from about 75 hours to about 200 hours. The mixture resulting from stcp d is cooled to a temperature of about 50 C and thereafter filtered to colicct the desired aluminosilicate solids. If the low temperature 25 C crystallization technique is used, then the precipitate is filtered without additonal preparatory steps. The filter cake can optionally be washed free of excess base deionized water wash pre ferred to avoid cation contamination . The filter cake is dried to a moisture content of 18 to 22 by weight using a tempZrature below about 150 C to avoid excessive dehydration. Preferably, the drying is performed at 100 C 105 C. Following is a typical pilot plant scale preparation of the aluminosilicates herein. PREPARATION OF ALUMINOSILICATE BUILDER Pounds Pounds Wt.

Water insoluble aluminosilicates having a molar ratio of A102 SiO2 smaller than 1, ie. in between 1.0 and about 0.5, preferably in between 1.0 and about 0.8, can be prepared in a similar manner. These aluminosilicate ion exchange materials A102 SiO2 1 are also capable of effectively reducing the free polyvalent hardness metal ion content of aqueous washing liquor in a manner substantially similar to the aluminosilicate ion exchange material having a molar ratio of A102 SiO2 1 as described hereinbefore. Examples of aliminosilicates having a molar ratio AlO2 SiO2 1, suitable for use in the instant compositions include 86 F A102 86 5i02 166 .264 H20 and Na6 . A102 6 SiO2 10 .15 H20 Although completely hydrated aluminosilicate ion exchange materials are preferred herein, it is recognised that the partially dehydrated aluminosilicates having the general formula given hereinbefore are also excellently suitabl for rapidly and effectively reducing the water hardness during the laundering operation. Of course, in the process of preparing the instant aluminosilicate ion exchange material, reaction crystallization parameter fluctuations can result in such partially hydrated materials.As pointed out previoisly, aluminosilicates having about 6 or less water do out function effectively ion the intended purpose in laundering com ext. The water insoluble, inorganic aluminosilicate ion exchange materials prepared in the feregoing manner are characterized by a particle size diameter from about 0,1 micron to about 10 microns. Preferred ion exchange materials have a particle size diameter from about 0.2 micron to about 10 microns. The term particle size diameter herein represents the number average particle size diameter of a given ion exchange ranterial as determined by conventional analytical technique such as, for exa .ple, microscopic determination, scanning electron microscope SEM . Preferred detergent compositions of the present invention contain from 1QE to 50 of the aluminosilicate, more preferably frcIr. 15 to 25 .Optional Components It is to be understood that granular compositions of the invention can be supplemented by all manner of detergent components, either by including such components in the aqueous slurry for spray dring or by admixing such components with the compositions of the invention after the drying step. Soil suspending agents at about 0.18 to 10 by weight such as water soluble salts of carboxymethyl cellulose, carboxyhxdroxymethylcellulose, and polyethylene glycols having a molecular weight of about 400 to 10,000 are common compoments of the present invetnion. Dyes, pigment optical brighteners, and perfumes can be added in varying amounts asdesired. Other materials such as fluorescers, anti septies, germicides, enzymes in minor amounts, anti caking agent suct as sodium sulfosuccinate, and sodium benzoate may also be added. Enzymes suitable for use herein include thore discussed in U.S. Patents 3,519,570 and 3,553,139 to Mccarty and McCarty et al issued 7 July, 1970 and 5 January, 1971 respectively.Particularly preferred are proteolytic enzymes having maximum intrinsic enzyme activity in the ranee from about pi 8 to about pH 9, especially preparations derived from B. subtilis such as ALCALIQSE Registered TradeMark manufactured by Novo Industri A.S, Copenhagen,Denmark, and MAXATASE Registered Trade Mark manufactured by GIST BROCADES N.V. Delft. These can be used in levels from about 0.1 to about 2 by weight of the composotion. Bleaches such as perborates and percarbonates and activators therefor can also be added to the instant composition, although it is a feature of the invention that such materials can be reduced in level or eliminated entirely.Suitably, therefore, per bleaches can be present in amounts up to about 15 , especially up to about 10 by weight of the compositions. An optional but highly desirable ingredient of the present compositions is from 0,1 to 3 of a polymeric material having a molecular weight of from 2000 to 2,000,000 and which is a copolymer of maleic acid or anhydride and a polymerisable monomer selected from compounds of formula EMI22.1 wherein R1 is CH3 or a C2 to C12 alkyl group EMI22.2 wherein R2 is H or CH3 and R3 is H, or a C1 to C10 alkyl group EMI22.3 wherein each of R4 and R5 is H or an alkyl group such that R4 and R5 together have 0 to 10 carbon atoms EMI22.4 and vi mixtures of any two or more thereof, said copolymers being potionally wholly or partly neutralised at the carboxyl groups by sodium or potassium. Preferred examples of polycarboxylates in the above classes are polymaleic acid acrylic acid copolymer, 70 30 acrylic acid hydroxy ethyl maleat copoly or, 11 styrene maleic acid copolymer, propylene maleic acid copolymer, isobutylene maleic acid copolymer, diisobutylene maleic acid copolymer, methylvinylether maleic acf.d copolymer, ethylvinylether maleic acid copolymer, ethylene maleic acid copolymer and vinyl pyrrolidone maleic acid copolymer.The preferred material is a methylvinylether maleic acid copolymer having an average molecular weight from 12000 to 1,500,000.
