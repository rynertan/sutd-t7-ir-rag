## Description
SYNERGISTIC HERBICIDAL COMPOSITIONS Background of the Invention The protection of crops fran weeds and other vegetation which inhibit croD growth is 3 constantly recurrina problem in aqriculture. To help combat this problem researchers in the field of synthetic chemistry have produced an extensive variety of chemicals and chemical formulations effective in the control of such unwanted growth, Chemical herbicides of many types have been disclosed in the literature and a lame number are in commercial use. In sone cases, active herbicides have been shown to be more effective in combination than when applied individually. The result is often termed synergism, since the combination demonstrates a Potency or activity level exceeding that which it would be expected to have, based on a knowledae of the individual potencies of the canponents. The present invention resides in the discovery that certain thiolcarbanates and certain benzene derivatives, alreadv known individually for their herbicidal potency, display this syneraisn when applied in ccmbination. Prior Art The e two classes of compounds forming the canposition which are the subject of the present invention are independently known in the art for their effects on plant qrowth. Thiolcarbanates are disclosed as herbicides in U.S. Patent Nos.3,185,720 Tilles et al., Mav 25, 1965 , 3,198,786 Tilles et al., Auq. 3, 1965 , and 2,913,327 Tilles et al., Nov. 17, 1959 .

The compositions of the present invention show synerqistic activity as herbicides in controllina the growth of undesirable vegetation when applied to such vegetation in pre or postemeraence application. The compositions are generally embodied in formulations which contain inert or occasionallv active inqredients or diluent carriers in addition to the active compounds. Examples of such ingredients or carriers are water, organic solvents, surface active agents, oil, water in oil emulsions, wetting aaents, dispersina agents, and emulsifvina aqents. The herbicidal formulations aenerally take the form of wettable powders, solutions or emulsifiable concentrates. Wettable powders are finely divided compositions comprising a particulate carrier impregnated with the herbicidal compound and additionally containing one or more surface active aaents. The surface active anent promotes raid dispersion of the powder in aaueous medium to form stable, sprayahle suspensions.A wide variety of surface active agents can be used, for example, long chain fatty alcohols and alkali metal salts of the sulfated fatty alcohols salts of sulfonic acid esters of long chain fatty acids and polyhydric alcohols, in which the alcohol soups are free, omega substituted polyethylene glvcols of relatively lona chain length. The herbicidal compositions can also be applied to the foliage in the form of a solution in a suitable solvent. Solvents frequently used in herbicidal formulations include kerosene, fuel oil, xylene, petroleum fractions with boilina ranges above xylene, and aromatic petroleum fractions rich in methylated naohthalenes. The e most preferred formulations are emulsifiable concentrates which consist of an oil solution of the herbicide alona with an emulsify inq aaent. Prior to use the concentrate is diluted with water to form. a suspended emulsion of oil droplets. The emulsifiers used are usuallv a mixture of anionic and nonionic surfactants. other additives such as spreading agents and stickers can be included in the emulsifiable concentrate. The formulations described above can be applied to the vegeta tion sought to be controlled in anv conventional manner either before or after the vegetation has emeraed from the soil. The vegetation can be in any stave of developnent after emergence, ranging fran seedlings to fully arown plants. Application can be achieved by anv conventional tedhniaue such as the use of ground spraying equipment or airvraft nimuted sprayers.Various other application techniques will be apparent to one skilled in the pesticide art.
