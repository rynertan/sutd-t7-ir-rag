# Process for purifying rare earth compositions.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for purifying a composition comprising at least one rare earth element. The process is useful for removing radioactive impurities. The process comprises the steps of 1 forming an aqueous solution of the composition to be purified having a pH between 4.0 and 6.5 2 precipitating a portion of the rare earth ions and the radioactive impurities by adding to the solution, while maintaining the pH between 4.0 and 6.5 i a soluble barium or strontium salt ii a soluble aluminium, magnesium or zirconium salt iii a selective precipitating agent and iv a sulphate ion providing salt. The preferred selective precipitating agent is 8 hydroxyquinoline. After precipitation, the process is completed by the steps of 3 separating the solution from the precipitate and 4 recovering a purified rare earth material from the solution. The process produces highly purified rare earth materials which can be used to form phosphors for X ray intensifying screens.
