# Closure and nozzle system for container for air curable material.

## Abstract
An improved closure and nozzle system for con tainers for air curable materials such as cartridges for sealant and caulking compounds is disclosed. A con tainer 11 such as a caulking cartridge is provided with a threaded neck 14 for attachment of a correspondingly threaded nozzle 12 having a tapered tip portion 22 designed to be cut off to provide a desired orifice size. A cap 13 having a snap fit ring 24 is designed to mate with a corresponding snap fit ring 23 on the nozzle 12 short of the tip 22 and also having a threaded external portion 26 designed to mate with the container neck 14 so that the cartridge can be resealed after opening.
