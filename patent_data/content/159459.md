# Production of tool steels using chemically prepared V2O3 as a vanadium additive.

## Abstract
Process for producing tool steel wherein a vandadium additive consisting essentially of chemically prepared, sub stantially pure V₂O₃ is added to a molten steel having a carbon content above about 0.35 wt. and containing sili con in an amount of from about 0.15 to about 3.0 wt. and wherein a slag covering the molten steel contains CaO and SiO₂ in a weight ratio CaO SiO₂ which is equal to or greater than unity.
