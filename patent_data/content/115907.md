# COMBUSTION ROUGHNESS SERVO CONTROL TO CONTROL FUEL AIR METERING OR EGR METERING TO AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE

## Abstract
A servo control which adjusts the supply of combustion diluent either excess air or EGR upwards until the statistical variation of flame speed achieves a set limit. The system is intended as a control coefficient input to an automatic control system capable of more rapid dynamic response than the roughness controller itself. For engines characterized by ex ceptional homogeneity and in cylinder flow control, control of flame speed variability up to set limit nearly minimizes NO
