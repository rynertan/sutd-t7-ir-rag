An oscillator 18 , asynchronous with a horizontal synchronizing component of the video signal being a free running oscillator or an oscillator locked to a multiple of the color subcarrier frequency of the video signal , supplies a clock signal to the character generator for controlling the tim ing of displayed character elements. A delay circuit 600 , cou pled in the clock signal input path to the character generator 36 or Fig. 1 to the output of the character generator, imparts an effective delay to the character elements dependent on the time relationship between the clock signals as produced by the oscillator and the horizontal synchronizing component of the video signal. The delay compensates for temporal and spatial distortions of displayed characters which otherwise could occur.

## Description
TELEVISION DISPLAY APPARATUS HAVING CHARACTER GENERATOR WITH NON LINE LOCKED CLOCK. This invention relates to television display apparatus of the type having a character generator for producing alphanumeric or graphic characters in raster scan form for display along with or in place of a received picture signal and which includes a clock for controlling the timing of picture elements produced by the character generator. Raster scan caption generators are useful in television receivers and monitors for displaying various types of information such as teletext data, time and channel settings, computer data and so on. In a typical generator individual alphanumeric characters or graphic symbols herein referred to generically as characters are represented by a dot matrix pattern stored in a read only memory ROM . A character is generated for display by transferring a desired dot pattern from the ROM to a high speed buffer and sequentially shifting the character dots or pixels picture elements out of the buffer with a pixel or dot clock. The serial signal, thus formed, is applied to a kinescope in a timed relation to the vertical and horizontal sweep so as to display the dot matrix pattern at a desired location on the raster. It is known that the clock which determines the pixel timing may be either line locked or burst locked . A line locked clock is one which is synchronized to operate at a frequency which is an integral multiple of the horizontal line frequency.The advantage of line locking the pixel clock is that each character dot of the caption signal will have a stable position on a displayed line even though the line frequency may vary. If, for example, the line frequency decreases making the sweep longer, the dot clock frequency will also decrease proportionately, thereby increasing the pixel period to compensate for the longer sweep time. The net effect for a line locked pixel clock is that variations of the pixel width and position due to variations in the horizontal line frequency are relatively unnoticeable. This is a distinct advantage when displaying captions along with a video signal provided by a source which may have a non standard or unstable line frequency e.g., a video tape recorder, video disc player, etc. . Notwithstanding the advantages of line locking the character generator dot clock, there are applications where it is advantageous to employ burst locking instead. In a burst locked system, the clock used for pixel timing is locked to a multiple of the color subcarrier frequency by means of a burst keyed phase locked loop PLL . An advantage of burst locking is that conventional color television receivers include a color oscillator locked to incoming burst thereby eliminating the need for a separate high frequency dot clock for the character generator. The color subcarrier reference frequency is also useful for decoding teletext data transmitted during the vertical blanking interval of received video signals Burst locked clocking is particularly important in digital television receivers where the composite video signal is sampled and converted to digital form for processing.In such systems the use of a clock locked to the color subcarrier reference frequency aids in minimizing cross color effects and other undesirable artifacts in displayed images and simplifies chroma demodulation. An integrated circuit which includes a teletext decoder and a character generator that is switchable between teletext input provided by the teletext decoder and an external data input and which is intended for use with a burst locked clock is described at pages 139 141 of the data book entitled DIGIT 2000 VLSI DIGITALTV SYSTEM published September 1981, by Deutsche ITTIndustries GmbH. The present invention resides,inone aspect, in the recognition of a problem which can occur in television systems of the type. wherein the clock for the character generator is locked to a multiple of the color subcarrier frequency rather than to a multiple of the line scanning horizontal synchronizing frequency. The problem, explained in detail subsequently with reference to FIGURES 1A, 1B and 2, is manifested as temporal and spatial distortions of displayed characters which can occur when receiving non standard video signals. A non standard video signal, as used herein, is defined as one wherein the ratio of the color subcarrier frequency to the horizontal line frequency does not conform to a specific fixed standard e.g. 227.5 1 for NTSC or 283.75 1 forPAL .Sources which may produce non standard signals include video tape recorders, video disc players, video game units, home computers, etc. In another known form of on screen display OSD character generator used in television receivers, an inductance capacitance LC or resistance capacitance RC oscillator is used for providing the clock signal which determines the timing of character elements or pixels provided by the character generator. The oscillator frequency about 5MHz determines the width of the smallest element of displayed characters. In this form the oscillator is line locked with the horizontal scanning signal to avoid a ragged or noisy appearance of vertical edges of displayed characters. Typically the oscillator is of the µ start stop kind which is disabled during the presence of the horizontal synchronizing pulse and enabled dt the termination of the synchronizing pulse. Where the oscillator is included on the same integrated circuit with the OSD character generator, two pins of the integrated circuit must be dedicated to providing connections for discrete external frequency determining components e.g., RL or Re elements . These external components of the oscillator present a potential source of radiation which may interfere with other signals in the receiver and so require filtering to prevent artifacts from appearing in displayed images. A further problem is that tolerance variations of the LC or RC oscillator components may require a factory adjustment for correct positioning of displayed characters. Also, changes in operating temperature and aging of circuit components can result in noticeable changes in the horizontal position of displayed characters.Further disadvantages are that at least one of the oscillator elements in the known system must be frequency adjustable and the external elements require printed circuit board space for mounting which adds to the overall cost of theOSD feature of the television receiver. Television receivers are known which include a 4 MRz crystal oscillator as a signal source for a frequency synthesis type of tuner. Receivers are under consideration wherein on screen display logic is to be included on the same integrated circuit as the frequency synthesis tuning system. In view of the foregoing, it is herein recognized that it would be advantageous to use the existing 4 MHz crystal oscillator as a clock source for theOSD character generator. Heretofore, this possibility has not been considered to be practical for various reasons.For example, the 4 MHz oscillator must be running continuously to satisfy the requirements of the tuning system. But even if it were possible some way to re design the frequency synthesizer logic to work with a start stop oscillator, a crystal oscillator cannot be started quickly enough to meet the needs of the OSD generator because of the very high IQII of the crystal.When a typical crystal oscillator is enabled the oscillations build up slowly in a period of time measured in milliseconds. This is simply too slow to meet the clock timing requirements of an OSD character generator. The present invention is therefore directed, in another aspect, to meeting the need for a reduction in line to line variations in the timing of character elements provided by a character generator in a television receiver where the character generator is clocked by a free running oscillator. As used herein, free running means that the oscillator is not locked to the line frequency of the video input signal supplied to the receiver although it may have a very stable and accurate frequency . A receiver embodying the invention comprises a a video processing means coupled to supply a video output signal to a display means, the video output signal having a horizontal synchronizing component. An oscillator means provides a clock signal that is not synchronous with the horizontal synchronizing component of the video output signal. A character generator means supplies a character signal in raster scan form to the display means for display with the video output signal, each line of the character signal comprising a plurality of character elements. The character generator means has a timing clock input coupled via a clock signal path to the oscillator means for controlling the timing of the character elements in accordance with the clock signal.A synchronization means is provided for imparting a delay to the presentation of said character signal to the display means in response to the time relationship between the clock signal and the horizontal synchronizing component of the video signal. To this end, a controlled delay may be interposed in the clock signal path for effectively imparting delay to the clock signal supplied to the character generator means. Alternatively, where appropriate, a controlled delay may be interposed between the character generator means and. the display device. The first aspect of the invention concerning a television display apparatus having a character generator driven by a burst locked clock, is illustrated by the first group of the accompanying drawings on sheets 1 6, in which FIGURES 1A, 1B, and 2 are diagrams illustrating certain aspects of the problem to which this aspect of the invention is addressed FIGURE 3 is a block diagram of a digital television receiver embodying the invention FIGURE 4 is a detailed block diagram of portions of the receiver of FIGURE 3 FIGURE 5 is a detailed block diagram of a delay element suitable for use in the receiver ofFIGURE 1 and FIGURE 6 is a block diagram illustrating a modification of the receiver of FIGURE 1. The second aspect of the invention, concerning the use of a free running oscillator to provide the clock signals, is illustrated in the second group of drawings on sheets 7 9, in which FIGURE 1 is a block diagram of a television receiver embodying the invention FIGURE 2 is a detailed block diagram of clock delay and control elements of the receiver ofFIGURE 1 and FIGURE 3 is a waveform diagram illustrating certain aspects of operation of the delay and control elements of FIGURE 2 . Considering now the first aspect in more detail, in FIGURE 2 waveform B represents the output of a clock that is phase locked to operate at four times the frequency of the color burst component of a video signal represented by waveform A for the case where the video signal conforms to the NTSC standard in which there are exactly 227.5 cycles of the color subcarrier per line.As shown, there are exactly 910 clock cycles during one line interval and thus the position tX of the first clock pulse No. 1 with respect to the center of the horizontal synchronizing pulse is the same in line N as it is in the following line, N 1. Thus, if the clock were used to time the pixels produced by a character generator in a receiver in which the horizontal sweep was locked to the line rate of waveform A, then the displayed character dots1 would be properly vertically aligned. For example, a character dot initiated by a given clock pulse on line N would be in exactly the same display position on the next line N 1 as illustrated in FIGURE 1A.For this standard signal case, the skew or timing difference X between the clock and the horizontal synchronizing signal is of no consequence because it is constant from line to line. For non standard signals, as hereinbefore defined, the skew is not constant from line to line waveform C of FIGURE 2 and this changing skew or phrase slip causes spatial and temporal distortion of characters as shown in FIGURE 1B. This results because the defection system is locked to sync waveform A but the pixel clock, being locked to burst, is continuously precessing or slipping by an amount Y with respect to sync for non standard signals waveform C . This makes the displayed character pixels precess, also, with respect to deflection. When a full cycle of clock is slipped , an abrupt discontinuity will occur jump , FIGURE 1B and this discontinuity will move vertically up or down the displayed characters because it will occur on different lines of different fields.These distortions are illustrated in FIGURE 1B. The problem of temporal and spatial distortion of displayed characters is solved, in accordance with the invention, in the receiver of FIGURE 3 by measuring the skew and effectively imparting delay to the characters in accordance with the skew measurement. By this means the character pixel positions are caused to effectively track the skew, and thus assume a fixed position on a line for both standard and non standard signals even though the clock is not locked to the horizontal synchronizing component of the video input signal. The receiver includes an antenna ANT. input terminal 10 coupled via a tuner, IF amplifier and video detection unit 12 of conventional design to the input of an analog to digital converter 14. Unit 12 processes RF modulated video signals applied to terminal 10 to provide a baseband analog video signal S1 which is converted to digital form signal S2 in A D converter 14. The RF signal may be either a standard broadcast signal provided by an antenna or cable source or it may be a non standard signal as hereinbefore defined provided by a tape recorder, video game, computer or other source. An auxilliary AUX. input terminal 16 is provided for obtaining the analog baseband video signal S1 from a source having provisions for baseband video output. The digitized video signal S2 is applied to a clock 18, to a. video processor 20 and to a horizontal vertical synchronizing H V SYNC unit 22 via a bus 24. Clock 18 comprises a burst keyed phase lock loop PLL and provides a clock CL output signal having a frequency locked to a multiple e.g., four times of the frequency of the chroma subcarrier component of video signal S2. For NTSC and PAL standard signals, the clock frequencies are about 14.318 NRz and 17.734 MHz respectively. For SECAM systems the clock would be locked to four times the center frequency of the SECAM bell filter e.g., about 17.144 MHz . The clock signal CL is supplied via a bus 26 indicated by arrow heads to A D converter 14 for controlling the sampling of signal S2 and is also applied along with digitized video signal S2 to a digital video processor 20 where signal CL controls the timing of various processing functions e.g., color separation, peaking, contrast control, hue and saturation control etc. provided by processor 20. The aforementioned data book describes a complete digital television receiver including digital video processor for NTSC, PAL and SECAM standards that are suitable for use as processor 20. The processed digital video signal S3 provided by processor 20 is converted to analog RGB form in a digital to analog D A converter and matrix unit 28 and the RGB signals s4 are applied by three RGB amplifiers in unit 30 to a kinescope 32 to be displayed. Deflection signals for kinescope 32 are generated by the horizontal vertical synchronizing unit 22 and amplified in a drive unit 34. Characters for display on kinescope 32 are provided by a character generator 36 having a clock input coupled via bus 26 to the output of clock 18 for controlling the timing of the character dots or picture elements pixels and a data input 38 for connection to a suitable source of data to be displayed e.g., a teletext decoder, time clock, channel indicator, external computer, etc. .The character signal S5 produced by generator 36 comprises, illustratively, R,G,B and blanking signals and is applied to the R,G and B amplifiers in unit 30 via a delay unit 40. The blanking signal is used to blank the processed video signal S4 in unit 30 in locations where characters are being displayed. Generator 36 and units 22, 30 and 34 are of conventional design and may be implemented as described in the aforementioned data book. The function of delay unit 40, in accordance with the invention, is to impart an effective delay to characters provided by generator 36 where the delay is proportional to the skew between clock signal CL and the horizontal synchronizing component of the digitized video signal S2. In this example of the invention, the skew compensating delay is realized by delaying the output signal S5 R,G,B and blanking produced by character generator 36. A similar result may be obtained, as will be discussed in connection with FIGURE 6, by applying the skew compensating delay to the clock signal CL supplied to generator 36. The skew data, for either case, is from a phase comparator in synchronizing unit 22 which provides a number which represents a fraction of a clock period.This fraction is the portion of a clock cycle equal to the time difference between the center of the horizontal synchronizing pulse and the last clock edge positive transition which precedes the center as illustrated by interval X in FIGURE 2B or interval X Y in FIGURE 2C.Alternatively, one may select another point in the horizontal synchronizing pulse or blanking period to make the skew measurement. An advantage of using the center of the sync pulse as compared, for example, with using only one edge, is that when the center is used the pulse may be more narrowly filtered which would disturb the accuracy of using an edge and the center calculated by averaging the leading and trailing edges, thereby reducing the effects of noise in the measurement. FIGURE 4 is a detailed block diagram of delay unit 40 and synchronizing unit 22 of the receiver ofFIGURE 1. Unit 40 comprises four individual variable delay units 402 408 having respective inputs coupled to receive the R, G, B and blanking signals S5 IN from character generator 36 and having outputs coupled to supply the skew compensated R,G,B and blanking signals S5OUT to amplifier 30. The delay control terminals of units 402 408 are all connected to a 5 bit bus 410 for receiving the skew data from unit 22. As previously explained, unit 40 shifts delays the character data by an amount proportional to the clock CL skew with respect to horizontal sync.The skew measurement is made in unit 22 at the start of each line, averaged to reduce noise effects and the delay compensation of unit 40 is set to the averaged skew value thereby effectively compensating for the effect of clock phase precession when receiving a non standard video input signal. The block diagram of unit 22 is a simplified representation of the type MAA 2500 Deflection ProcessorUnit integrated circuit which is described in more detail in the aforementioned ITT databook. Unit 22 includes elements for making the skew measurements, averaging them and disabling the skew data when standard signals are being received. In unit 22 the video signal S2 is applied to a sync separator unit 420 which supplies a vertical sync signal, V, to a vertical processing unit 422 and a horizontal sync signal, H, to a programmable divider 424, to a standard signal detector 426 and to phase comparator I 428. Unit 422 includes suitable vertical pulse integration and synchronization circuits for processing the vertical sync signal V for application to kinescope 32. Unit 424 divides the clock signal to provide line rate output pulses P which are compared by phase comparator I 428 with the sync pulses of video signal S2. The phase comparator output signal S6 is applied to a loop filter and skew data processing unit 430 in which a low pass filter averages the phase measurements. The integer portion S7 of the averaged signal is applied via bus 431 to divider 424 to change the division factor in a sense to phase lock pulse P to the incoming sync component of video signal S2. When locked, pulse P will differ in timing from sync by no more than a fraction df one cycle of the clock signal CL. The fractional portion of each phase measurement represents the time interval between the clock signal CL and horizontal sync in terms of fractions of a clock cycle.The skew data signal, which represents the line by line precession of the clock signal relative to sync, is predicted for a given line by storing the fractional portion of the average phase measurement from the previous line and adding the stored number to the previous skew data value. The fractional portion of the resultant sum is applied as the current skew data signal S8 to delay unit 40. If an overflow results from the sum, then the S7 signal is incremented by one to delay pulse P by one integer clock cycle. The skew data signal thus formed is also applied to phase comparators 428 and 432 to provide fine resolution of the phase comparison since the pulse P only occurs on clock edges and thus represents coarse phase information.The standard signal detector 426 is in essence a lock detector which disables loop filter 430 when the ratio existing between the color subcarrier frequency and the horizontal frequency corresponds to a standard ratio 910 1 for NTSC or 1135 1 for PAL . For the purpose of equalizing phase changes in the horizontal output stage due to switching response tolerances or loading of the deflection circuits, the pulse Itpll passes through a further phase lock loop comprising phase comparator II 432, loop filter 434 and delay unit 436. In the phase comparator II 432, the phase position between the output signal of the programmable divider 424 and the leading edge of the horizontal flyback pulse is measured with fine resolution being provided by the skew data signal S8 .The deviation from the desired phase position is filtered in filter 434 and fed to delay unit 436 which phase shifts the pulse P to provide the horizontal drive signal H out for the horizontal driver in such a way that the horizontal flyback pulse acquires a fixed phase position with respect to pulse P which, in turn, retains a fixed phase position with respect to the horizontal sync component of the video signal. To avoid phase jitter in the horizontal PLL circuit, unit 436 includes an additional gate delay line for pulse P which is controlled by the skew data signal S8 to provide a fine resolution of the horizontal drive signal. Delay units 402 408 of FIGURE 4 for the receiver of FIGURE 1 may be implemented as shown in FIGURE 5. The 5 bit skew data bus 410 is applied to a 1 of 32 decoder 502 which supplies decoder outputs via bus 504 to a multiplex switch 506. An input signal to be delayed e.g., R,G,B or blanking is applied to the input terminal 505 a cascade connection of delay elements 508 512 N which may be passive devices e.g., R C networks or active devices e.g., non inverting gates or buffer amplifiers .The outputs or taps of the cascade connection are coupled to the inputs of switch 506 which couples the output of a selected element to an output terminal 514 in response to the decoded skew data supplied by bus 504. If, for example, the skew data is zero, switch 506 couples input terminal 505 to output terminal 414. If the data value is 3 00011 binary , switch 506 couples the output of element 512 to terminal 514 thereby imparting a delay to the input signal of three units . A unit delay, illustratively, may be on the order of one sixteenth of the period of clock signal CL e.g., about four nanoseconds for a 14.3 MHz clock to thereby provide a total delay range of about two full clock periods. FIGURE 6 represents a modification of the receiver of FIGURE 1 wherein the output signal S5 of character generator 36 is effectively delayed by delaying the clock signal CL supplied to generator 36 rather than delaying the individual R,G,B and blanking output signalsS5. This is done by connecting the output of generator 36 directly to the R,G,B amplifier unit 30 and interposing a delay unit 600 in the clock line bus 26 for generator 36. Delay unit 600 illustratively, may be of the type shown in FIGURE 5. Turning now to the aspect of the invention illustrated by FIGURES 1 3 , the receiver of FIGURE li includes an antenna input terminal 110 for connection to a source of RF modulated video signals such as a standard broadcast signal, a cable signal or the RF output of a video tape recorder, a video disc player, computer, a video game unit or the like. Terminal 110 is coupled to the input of a voltage controlled tuner E2 which is able to select a particular one of a relatively large number of television channels by tuning control voltage on signal Sl1 supplied thereto.The tuning control signal Sl1 is provided by means of a conventional FS frequency synthesis tuning logic units4 e.g., a phase lock loop, PLL . Unitll4 multiples the frequency of a reference signal S2lprovided by a crystal oscillator 116 by a number related to the desired television channel selected by the user of the receiver. The frequency of the crystal 118 which controls oscillator 26 is typically about 4 MHz e.g., .3.90625 MHz for NTSC standard TV Channel assignments. The output signal S3 of tuner 112 is an IF intermediate frequency signal corresponding to the TV channel selected by the user of the receiver by means of tuning logic unitll4 and is applied to a video processing unit 320 which includes a conventional IF amplifier, video detector and other video signal processing circuits e.g., hue and saturation controls, AGC circuits, etc. . Unit20 includes an auxiliary AUX. input terminal for connection to a source of baseband video input signal in so called monitor applications when the tuner 112 is not used.The processed baseband video signal 541 provided by unitl20 is applied to a conventional synchronizing unit 122 and to a display unitl24 e.g., a kinescope, projection unit or the like . Unit22 generates vertical synchronizing signals VS and horizontal synchronizing signals HS for display unitl24 so as to display the signal S4lin conventional raster scan form on unit 124. The receiver includes a raster scan character generator 126 having an input terminal128 for connection to a source of character data e.g., time, channel identification, teletext, etc. to be displayed on unitl24 along with or in place of the video signal S41 and an output for supplying the character data signal S51 in raster scan form to unit 124. Generator 126 is of conventional design and includes inputs coupled to receive the vertical and horizontal synchronizing signals VS andHS, respectively provided by synchronizing unit22 for controlling the position of alphanumeric data or graphic symbols to be displayed on unitl24. In accordance with this aspect of the invention, the timing of individual character elements i.e., character dots or pixels of the character signal SSlis controlled by means of a high frequency clock signal S6 derived from the free running oscillatorll6. The term free running as used herein, means that oscillatoril6, although very stable and accurate, is not synchronized with the horizontal synchronizing component of the video signal S41 and therefore the clock signal S2t has an indeterminate phase or timing relationship with the horizontal synchronizing component HS of video signal S41 The clock signal 56 is produced by applying the crystal oscillator signal 521 to a delay unitl30 which generates a plurality of phases of the 4 MHz clock signal S21. In essence, control unit140 compares the horizontal synchronizing signal HS with the output signal S7lof delay unit30 to identify the particular one.of the multi phase clock signals which happens to be most closely in phase with a specified point on the horizontal synchronizing signal waveform as will be explained subsequently. Unit 240 supplies a clock delay identification signal S81 to a delay selector unitl50 which, in turn, selects the most closely in phase one of the delayed clock signals 571 for application to the clock input terminal 127 of character generatorl26. Summarizing the foregoing, control unit 140 in combination with delay unit 130 measures the phase or time difference between a given point on the horizontal synchronizing signal HS and the clock signal S2 at the start of each line and, by means of delay selector150, effectively imparts a delay to the signal S2 to maintain the phase of the clock signal S61 supplied to generator126 relatively constant with respect to the horizontal synchronizing signal HS on a line by line basis. The jitter or line to line timing variations of the processed delayed clock signal 56 is proportional to the number of phases of the signal 57 produced in delay unit 130.If, for example, a clock cycle is divided into eight phases, then the maximum line to line jitter of displayed character dots or pixels produced by generatorl26 will correspond to only one eighth of one clock cycle.Accordingly, even though the clock signal S2 is not phase locked to the horizontal synchronizing signal.HS, characters displayed on unit which is synchronized with HS will have a uniform vertical alignment. Thus, in the receiver of FIGURE 1 a separate line locked oscillator is not needed for character generation.Moreover, the on screen display logic elements 030, 140, 150, 6 may be incorporated on the same integrated circuit as the FS tuning logic unit 114 thereby eliminating the need for any additional clock input pins for the character generator 126. FIGURE 2 is a detailed logic diagram illustrating a. specific implementation of units 30,140 and 350 of FIGURE l. The delay unit 130 comprises a cascade connection of eight delay elements 201 208 having an input coupled to receive the 4 MBz clock signal S2land output taps for providing individual phases of the clock signal Pl P9 . The total delay of the delay line should be somewhat greater than the period of one 1 cycle of the 4 MHz clock signal S21, e.g., about 300 to 400 nanoseconds. Such a delay can be realized in a polysilicon signal path of appropriate length on an NMOS integrated circuit.Alternatively, the desired delay may be implemented by means of a series of inverters, two 2 between each tap point. As illustrated in FIGURE 31, each section 201 208 of delay line 130 delays the 4 MHz clock signal 4S2 by about 45 nanoseconds. Shorter or longer delays can be utilized depending on how many different phases are desired for reducing the edge jitter of displayed characters. Since, as a practical matter, a delay of exactly 45 nanoseconds cannot be controlled precisely from unit to unit in a conventional manufacturing process or may be subject to variation with temperature or voltage, the logic circuits are designed to accommodate reasonable changes in the delays. Specifically, the total nominal delay of unitl30 is selected to be about 315 nanoseconds which is longer than the 250 nanoseconds period of the 4 MHz clock signal S2lto allow for delay line tolerance variations. Unit40, comprises eight AND gates 211 218, each having a first input coupled to receive the horizontal synchronizing signal HS, a second input coupled to receive a respective one of the clock signal S2 phases P1 P9 and an output coupled to the clock input C of a respective one of eight data D type flip flops 221 228 The data D input of each flip flop is connected to a source not shown of positive potential corresponding to a logic 1 value. Each flip flop has a reset input R coupled to the true Q output of the immediately following flip flop with the reset input of the last flip flop 228 beingcoupled.to receive the output of delay element 208 i.e., phase P9 . Delay selector units50 comprises eight AND gates 231 238, each having a first input coupled to receive a respective one of the clock phase signals P1 P8 and having a second input coupled to receive a corresponding one of the flip flop output signals Q1 Q8. Gate 231, for example, receives P1 and Q1 as inputs. The remaining gates are similarly connected. All outputs of gates 231 238 are applied to an eight input NOR gate 240 which has an output coupled to the clock C input of a D flip flop 250. An inverter 260 applies the Q output of flip flop 250 to its D data input to condition flip flop 250 to divide the frequency of the pulses applied to its clock input by two. The clock phase P9 is applied to the reset input of flip flop 250 to provide a consistent starting phase for the division process. In operation, delay unit 130 provides the nine phases of the clock signal S2las previously noted. When the horizontal synchronizing signal is high i.e., sync tip interval, FIGURE 31 gates 211 218 are all primed to apply respective ones of clock phases Pl P9 to the clock input terminals of flip flops 221 228. Since each flip flop resets the one preceding it, the flip flops are clocked sequentially by the phase signals to provide Q output signals as shown in FIGURE At time T1 the horizontal synchronizing pulse HS makes a transition to logic zero thereby disabling each ofAND GATES 211 218. As a result the sequential clocking of flip flops 221 228 stops and all retain their state at the time T1 when the sync pulse ended . From the wave formsQ1 Q8 it is seen that at time TI only flip flops 222 Q1 and 227 Q7 were in a SET condition. This enables AND gates 232 and 237. The remaining AND gates 231, 233 236 and 238 are all disabled since the corresponding flip flops are reset. During the interval T1 T2 the outputs of all disabled gates are zero and the outputs of the two primed gates 232 and 237 are high because in this interval clock phases P2 and P7 are both high. Accordingly, the output of NOR gate 240 is low logic zero . At this time flip flop 250 is in a reset condition having been reset from the last horizontal synchronizing pulse supplied to its reset input. At times T2 T3 clock phase P2 and phaseP7 are both low thereby disabling gates 232 and 237. For this condition all eight inputs to NOR gate 240 are low and the output of gate 240 makes a positive transition and remains high until clock phase P7 disables gate 237 at time T3. Flip flop 250 is triggered by the positive transition of the output of gate 240 to provide the first half cycle of the output clock signal S61 Thereafter, for the remainder of the line, flip flop 250 is triggered clocked by the trailing edge of clock phase P2 which, as shown, is the closest phase of signal S2lwith respect to the signal HS at the moment of the negative transition of signal HS. Since there is a constant delay of one half of one cycle of signal S2lin clocking flip flop 250, the phase of the output clock signal S7lis delayed with respect to the trailing edge of signal HS by 125 nanoseconds. The pulse to pulse jitter of signal 571 corresponds to the delay time of one stage of unit 130 which, in this example of the invention, is 45 nanoseconds.
