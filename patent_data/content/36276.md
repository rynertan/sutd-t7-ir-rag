# Fire detection system.

## Abstract
A fire detection system has at least one fire sensor Sal , a receiver 1 including a power source 9 connected to the fire sensor Sal for supplying a power source voltage to the fire sensor Sal and a receiving relay RLa for receiving a fire detection signal from the fire sensor Sal , and at least one power signal line La,Lo for coupling the fire sensor Sal to the receiver 1 . The receiver 1 comprises a timer 2 for producing a clock signal throughout the day and commanding means 4 for providing at least one predetermined detection sensitivity change command for the fire sensor Sal , which command varies according to the time of day in response to the clock signal from the timer 2 . The fire sensor Sal comprises sensitivity change control means 14,12 for changng the detection sensitivity of the fire sensor Sal in response to the detection sensitivity change command from the commanding means 4 . The fire detection sensitivity of the fire sensor Sal is varied in accordance with predictive fire damage conditions predetermined in view of people s activities during the time of day. The system can achieve an early discovery of fire to minimize the fire damage.
