# Variable speed induction motor drive.

## Abstract
An inverter 200 controls an induction motor 202 in response to signals from a power factor control circuit 203 . The power factor control circuit receives signals related to motor terminal voltages and multi plexes them to a comparator 80 . The inverter and multiplexor 207 are sequenced each time the compara tor 80 input reaches a reference level. The frequency of the inverter 200 is thus self generated. The power factor of the system can be controlled to implement a variety of control strategies.
