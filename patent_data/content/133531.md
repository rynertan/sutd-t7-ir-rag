# Immobilization of biocatalysts.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method for the immobilization of an enzyme producing microorganism or an enzyme produced thereby. The method involves fiocculating the biocatalyst with polyethylenimine and adding chitosan and glutaral dehyde to form a reaction product. In a preferred embodi ment, the reaction product is extruded onto the revolving plate of a spheronizing device to form spherical enzyme aggregates having enhanced physical and biocatalytic prop erties.
