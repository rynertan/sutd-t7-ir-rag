# Production of alkali metal chlorides.

## Abstract
When alkali metal aluminosilicates are heated with calcium and or magnesium chloride to a temperature at which the latter is liquid reaction occurs with formation of a liquid phase which is a glass. When this glass is cooled and leached with water the alkali metal can be recovered as the corresponding chloride from the aqueous eluate. Since the aluminosilicates occur naturally this provides a ready means of recovering potassium and lithium from their aluminosilicates. The reaction is also applicable to various kinds of waste products such as fly ash.

## Description
PIODUCTION OF ALKALI NATAL CIILOjT T S This invention relates to the production of an alkali metal chloride from materials comprising an alkali metal aluminosilicate. Of particular interest is the production of potassium chloride from naturally occurring and waste materials comprising a potassium aluminosilicate. Potassium is one of the most common elements present in the crust of the earth. It occurs in varying proportions in a wide variety of minerals. Only a small number of such deposits are workable however. These are deposits of potassium chloride with sodium chloride and or water soluble magnesium compounds which have been formed by the evaporation of prehistoric lakes.Such deposits occur for example at Stassfurt, Alsace, in the Ural Mountains and at Searles Lake, California.Such deposits are worked by mining by conventional underground methods or by solution mining, followed by appropriate end treatment depending upon the intended use of the crude material. Thus the potassium content may be raised by leaching the product with hot water and crystallising the resulting solution. Alternatively separation of finely divided material slurried in water and aerated in the presence of fatty acid amines is reported to be capable of producing material 97 o pure. Deposits comprising potassium chloride are, at the present time, the only ones which have been extensively worked and since the extent thereof is limited, the composition variable and the demand for potassium and its salts is constantly increasing it would be desirable to develop alternative sources of compounds containing this important element in or near the major consuming countries. Amongst the available minerals containing potassium there are a number of minerals which may be designated as alkali metal aluminosilicates and amongst these are several in which the predominating alkali metal is potassium. These are potential sources of potassium. It is accordingly one object of the invention to provide a method by which the potassium or other alkali metal present in such minerals may be substantially wholly made available in soluble form. The present invention provides a process for the production of an aqueous solution of an alkali metal chloride from an alkali metal aluminosilicatecontaining material characterised in that a mixture of said aluminosilicate in finely divided form and calcium and or magnesium chloride, is heated at a temperature at which said chloride or chlorides is molten for a time sufficient to effect substantial conversion thereof to a glass, cooling said glass and leaching the cooled glass with water. The preferred starting materials are the potassium aluminosilicates which include the potassium felspars, the potassium felspathoids leucite and the potassium micas. The potassium felspars include orthoclase and microcline they are common in igneous and metamorphic rocks and in felspathic shales. These felspars may contain small proportions of sodium and some iron. However in a potassium felspar the potassium content, on a molar or weight basis, is much greater than that of sodium. Leucite is another potassium aluminosilicate which has however a hither proportion of alumina and X 20 relative to silica than the potassium felspars. The potassium micas are materials such as wliite mica or muscovite.Such micas contain free hydroxyl groups and correspond substantially to the formula EAl2AlSi301o oH 2 The felspathic shales of interest are those in which the rock is wholly or preponderantly a potassium felspar. In addition to tie above naturally occurring materials certain by products are available in industry in large quantities which comprise aluinosili cates and which are a potential source of potassium.The most important of these is fly ash obtained by the combustion of coal principally from electricity generating stations other potential sources are peat ash, wood ash aid colliery waste. The aluminosilicate materials are used in a finely divided form. It is presently preferred to use a material which passes a No. 16 British StandardSieve. Finer material such as a material substantially all of which passes a No. 60 or a No. 150 BritishStandard Sieve can be used but such a degree of fineness has been found not to be necessary for the present purpose. For this purpose the minerals require to be ground but fly ash is sufficiently fine as it is. With regard to the calcium chloride which may be used large quantities of this are available as a waste product, for example, the effluent from theSolvay process for the manufacture of sodium carbonate from sodium chloride. This effluent is a mixture of calcium chloride with a minor proportion of sodium chloride. This material is frequently available as an aqueous solution which can be made into a slurry with the finely divided potassium or other. alkali metal aluminosilicate and then dried. It is not necessary to separate the sodium chloride since mixtures of sodium chloride and calcium chloride fuse at lower temperatures than does either salt when pure and this enables the desired reaction between calcium chloride and potassium or other alkali metal aluminosilicate to commence at a lower temperature than it would in the absence of sodium chloride.However when it is preferred not to introduce sodium chloride into the reaction mixture crystalline calcium chloride dihydrate can be used and admixed with the finely divided aluminosilicate material. Regarding tlle magnesium chloride which may also be used, substantial quantities of this are available in certain localities in the form of bitterns, a residue obtained in t ie production of sblar salt. If desired, calcium and magnesium. chlorides may be used in admixture, e.g. as Solvay effluent admixed with bitterns. Varying proportions of calcium and or magnesium chloride to the aluminosilicate material have been used. the best rocs lots have been obtained when equal proportions by wet t of calcium chloride, reckoned as the dihydrate, and aluminosilicate are used. Whilst larger proportions of calcium chloride relative to aluminosilicate can be used, e.g. 1 .20 proportions by weight, there appears to be no advantage and the presence of the additional unreacted calcium and or magnesium chloride in the aqueous solution obtained on leaching the reaction product may constitute t disadvantage. To obtain a good recovery of alkali metal chlorides it appears necessary to use at least 80p by weight of calcium chloride based upon the aluminosilicate material used. The reaction which occurs is a quite vigorous one with formation of a liquid phase. At elevated temperatures alkali metal is lost as alkali metal chloride and consequently heating should be discontinued when a sufficient conversion has occurred. The minimum practical temperature for most materials is 800 C but as this will require a relatively long hcat ing period temperatures of 900 to 10000C are preferred.In the case of fly ash somewhat lower temperatures can be used and the minimum practical temperature is about 700 C. It should be appreciated that the finer the starting material the more rapid is the reaction and the greater the loss by volatilisation if the reaction mixture is overheated. Accordingly to obtain maximum recovery of alkali metal in solution, particle size, temperature of heating and heating time should be correlated. For example, doubling the heating time without reducing the temperature may result in the loss of as much as one third of the potassium chloride produced due to volatilisation. A heating time of 30 minutes at 1000 C has been found to be a useful one using equal weights of raw feed stock and pure calcium chloride. However longer heating periods will result in loss by volatilisation at this temperature.A heating time of one hour at 900 C also gives useful results using equal weights of starting materials and has been found to produce a calcium compound or compounds which is are less soluble in water than the calcium compound or compounds produced at 10000C. A convenient range of times and temperatures is from 850 10500C with times of from 0.3 to 2 hours te shorter times being used with the higher temperatures and vice versa. Calcium chloride melts at 772 C and magnesium chloride at 7040C and it is believed that this fact has a bearing upon the nature of the reaction which takes place. An attempt to replace a part of the calcium chloride by calcium carbonate was unsuccessful and actually led to a diminution in the yield of potassium chloride when reactions were carried out under the same conditions. The results obtained showed that crushed calcium carbonate merely acted as a diluent under the conditions envisaged and played no other part in the reaction. Sodium chloride, because it forms eutectic mixtures, is of benefit in reducing reaction temperatures. After the reaction has taken place the reaction mixture is then cooled and leached wit water. The product may be broken up into small pif es before leaching is undertalcen or it may be quenched. The water used for leaching may be at a superambient temperature. When substantial quantities of material are to be leached this may be carried out as a cour.ter current operation. The reaction between alkali metal aluminosilicates and calcium a.ld or magnesium chloride occurs with all the alkali metals.If the material is high in lithium, such as spodumene rubidium and or caesium, such as pollucite aluminosilicates these metals may be released and recovered as the chlorides by the same process as that used for the more connonly occurring potassium. The concentration of alkali metal chloride in the aqueous leach liquors may be increased by evapora tion of the liquors by heating with or without vacuum, Owing to the much greater solubility of calcium chloride than the a4kalimetal clllonides, the latter crystallises first and may be separated by fractional crystallisation. If theSe crystals are then separated and the liquors obtained cooled, calcium chloride crystallises and may then be separated it is suit able for use in treating a further batch of alumino silicate material. Separation of individual alkali metal chlorides in crystalline form may also be effected by froth flotation employing a reagent such as a sulphonated long chain fatty alcohol which imparts hydrophobic properties to them in varying degrees. The process of tho invention will now be illus trated by certain specific Examples. In Examples 1 4 five different kinds of material containing potassium alumino silicates were tested these are set out inTable I.

Example I Mixtures of microcline and calcium chloride in different ratios by weight were investigated. The mixtures were first prepared as an aqueous slurry, dried and then heated to 9000C for the time indicated inTable II, the product cooled and leached with water.The potassium content of the leach liquors was then estimated by flame photometry and or by atomic absorption. The following results were obtained.

Whilst heating to 70000C for 0.5 hour gave a higher recovery than heating to 900 C for 1.0 hour surprisingly the coarser particulate material gave a higher recovery than the finer materials employed. This is attributed to volatilisation or possible loss as dust from the reaction melt or both. Example 4 It has been indicated that when the reaction is carried out at 10000C more water soluble calcium is present in the leached product than when the reaction is carried out at 900 C for a longer time. This is illustrated by the following tests. The material used was microcline grade C. Equal weights of this material and calcium chloride dihydrate were heated to 9000C for 1 hour and 100000 for 0.5 hour respectively. The leach liquors were analysed to determine the contents of potassium chloride and calcium chloride per unit volume.The following results were obtained.

This suggests that more than one reaction is tasking place and that the rates of the reactions differ. Example 5 Mixtures of crushed muscovite mica and calcium chloride in different ratios by weight were investigated.The mixtures were prepared as aqueous slurries, dried and then heated to the indicated temperatures, the product cooled and leached with water. The potassium content of the leach liquors was estimated by flame photometry. The following results were obtained.

Example 6 As previously pointed out Solvay effluent normally consists of a mixture of calcium chloride and sodium chloride. The sodium chloride content may be substantial and may approximate that of a eutectic mixture of minimum melting point when evaporated to dryness. Using samples of the same muscovite as that used in Example 5 a series of mixtures were prepared containing 50.79 g by weight of the muscovite, 32.50,o by weight of anhydrous calcium chloride and 15.8 by weight of sodium chloride. The following results were obtained.

The recorded yield of greater than 100 in the last run is attributed to interference from other ions in the procedures used. Example 7 Another sample of fly ash was used which analysed average of two analyses 3.08 by weight of potassium. No grinding was necessary. Mixtures were prepared by slurrying the asb with calcium chloride, drying and then heating to the indicated temperatures, the product cooled and leached with water. The potassium content of the leach liquors was estimated. The following results were obtained.

It is to be borne in mind that the potassium is almost certainly combined in several different kinds of compounds, including silicates, in fly ash and the conditions employed are those which will ensure reaction of the potassium aluminosilicates present. Example 8 Experiments similar to those reported underExample 6 were carried out using fly ash. The mixtures used contained 50.7 by weight of fly ash, 32.5 by weight of anhydrous calcium chloride and 15.8 by weight of sodium chloride. The following results were obtained.

Example 9 Samples of spodumene which passed a No. 60British Standard Nesh were heated with a calcium chloride dihydrate and b a mixture of calcium chloride and a minor proportion of sodium chloride in the proportion of equal amounts by weight, based upon the calcium chlorideat 1000 C for 0.5 hour, cooled and leached with water. The resulting solutions contained 30.9 and 31.9 , by weight of the lithium present in the starting material as lithium chloride. Example 10 A sample of muscovite mica which passed a No. 60British Standard Mesh was heated with a mixture of magnesium chloride and a minor proportion of sodium chloride in the proportion of equal amounts by weight, based upon the magnesium chloride, at 10000C for 0.5 hour, cooled and leached with water,The resulting solution contained 44.5 by weight of the potassium present ir the starting material as potassium chloride. It will be appreciated from the above that this invention enables materials which are at present regarded as waste materials to be utilised as a source of potassium. The potassium containing material may be an ash derived by the combustion of a carbonaceous material. The calcium chloridecontaining material may be Solvay effluent of which large quantities are at present availalzAe wherever sodium carbonate is manufactured. Thus the invention provides the opportunity to use two different kinds of waste materials to produce a material viz. a potassium salt solution, for which there are many uses.
