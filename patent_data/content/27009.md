# Process for producing fluorinated polymer having ion exchange groups.

## Abstract
A fluorinated copolymer having ion exchange groups is produced by copolymerizing a fluorinated ethylenic unsatura ted monomer and a functional monomer having a carboxylic acid group or another functional group which can be conver ted into a carboxylic acid group in an aqueous medium in the presence of a polymerization initiator source and in the pre sence of a specific molecular weight regulator. The specific molecular weight regulator is selected from aliphatic alkanes, alicyclic alkanes and water soluble organic solvents and con trols the molecular weight without lowering the copolymeriza tion velocity or the stability of the aqueous latex.
