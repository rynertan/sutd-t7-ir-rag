N AMINO OR HYDROXY PHENETHYLI 1,2,3, 4 TETRAHYDROISOQUINOLINES, PRECURSORS THEREOF, AND METHODS OF PREPARATION FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates broadly to pharmaceutical compositions, to their administration as analgesic agents and to their preparation. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION More specifically, the invention pertains to new 1,2,3 ,4 tetrahydroisoquinolines of the formula 1 EMI2.1 wherein R1 and R2 respectively are hydrogen, hydroxy or alkoxy of 1 to 4 carbon atoms R3 and R4 respectively are hydrogen or alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and R5 is hydroxy, nitro orEMI2.2 wherein R6 and R7 respectively are hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or RCOwherein R is hydrogen or alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The compounds have been found to possess analgesic activity, but are devoid of the opiate type effects of narcotic analgesics. Accordingly, the invention also includes pharmaceutical preparations containing one or more of the above compounds as an active ingredient and to methods for administering the same. Being organic bases, the compounds of this invention readily form salts with organic and inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, maleic, tartaric, sulfuric, and other non toxic acids to form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. It is intended that isomers, racemates and optically active forms of any of the compounds of formula 1 are also included within the scope of the invention. Particularly satisfactory compounds from the point of view of analgesia are compounds in which Rl and R2 are methoxy, R3 is hydrogen, R4 is CH3, and k5 is NH2 orNHCH3. BACKGROUND A. Brossi et al, Analgetics, Editor, G. DeStevens,,Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 5, Academic Press pp 281 330, report central analgesic effects of l substituted phenyl ethyl 1,2 3 ,4 tetrahydroisoquinolines. The optimal analgesic activity was achieved by compounds of the formula 2 EMI3.1 in which R1 is CH3 and R2 is Cl or N02. Compounds in which R2 is NH2 or substituted amino were not reported.The authors also report one compound having a structure corresponding to formula 1 , supra, in which R1 and R2 are methoxy, R3 is hydrogen, R4 is CH3 and R5 is p chloro. This compound is reported not to exhibit analgesic properties. METHODS OF PREPARATION The compounds of this invention can be synthesized in accordance with the procedures outlined below.Illustrative techniques are shown in the reaction schemes and in the specific non limiting Examples. Temperatures are in degrees centigrade unless otherwise indicated. EMI4.1 EMI5.1 The intermediate 3,4 dihydroisoquinoline III is prepared by the Bischler Napieralski reaction of theN acetyl compound II which itself can be prepared by acetylation of 3,4 dimethoxyphenethylamine I .Reduction of III to the 1,2,3,4 tetrahydroisoquinoline IV is accomplished by either of two methods, sodium borohydride in methanol or catalytic hydrogenation over palladium charcoal catalyst. The former method is preferred for larger scale reactions. The tetrahydroisoquinoline IV is acylated with 4 nitrophenylacetic acid in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide to give the amide V , which is converted by either of two methods A or B to the aminophenethyl derivative VII .The preferred route A is to reduce the amide carbonyl with borane and, subsequently, to reduce the nitro group catalytically with hydrogen over palladium carbon.Alternatively, route B reduces the nitro group first by catalytic hydrogenation to give VIII and then the carbonyl function with borane. Compound VII is obtained as the free base which can then be converted to the desired salt form. Using appropriately substituted reagents, other analogs can be prepared by those skilled in the art of organic chemistry. The reactions outlined above through the preparation of compound IV are well known in the art. The reactions indicated thereafter are known in the art in a general sense only.

In addition, gross behavioral and toxicological effects as well as general pharmacological profiling were evaluated in mice by the intraperitoneal route of administration. In mice, two test procedures designed to detect analgesic activity were used the phenylbenzoquinone PBQ writhing test and the hot plate test. In the PBQ procedure, the drugs were injected 15 minutes before an intraperitoneal injection of PBQ was made for the subcutaneous studies and 30 minutes before the PBQ for the oral studies. Animals who failed to writhe in the 5 to 15 minute interval following the PBQ injection were considered protected from the pain. In the hot plate test, subjects were placed on the surface of a hot copper plate maintained at 54.5 1.00C. For the oral studies drugs were injected 30 minutes before testing on the hot plate. Drugged animals whose reaction time consisting of paw licking or jumping behavior was equal to or greater than 2 seconds over the average of an untreated control group of mice were considered to be protected from the pain. In rats, two procedures designed to detect analgesic activity were used the hot plate test and the tail flick test. In the hot plate test, rats were placed on the surface of a copper plate maintained at 54.5 1.00C and their response latency again consisting of paw licking or jumping behavior determined at 60 minutes and again at 30 minutes before drug injection. These response times were again determined 30 and 60 minutes after drug injection and animals whose response latencies were equal to or greater than three seconds over the second pre treatment trial i.e., the one done 30 minutes before dosing were considered protected from the pain.In the tail flick procedure, a high intensity light beam was focused on the blackened portion of the rat s tail and the reaction time, i.e., latency to move its tail, was measured before and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after drug administration. A subject was considered protected from the pain stimulus whenEMI34.1 where PO is the individual post treatment value and Pra the pre treatment value.
