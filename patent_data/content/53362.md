# Process for the production of lithographic printing plates and light sensitive materials for use therein.

## Abstract
A process for the production of lithographic print ing plates, and a light sensitive material for use in the process are described. The light sensitive material com prises an electrically conductive support having a hydro philic surface, and a positive type light sensitive layer and a photoconductive insulative layer on the support, wherein the positive type light sensitive layer and the photoconductive insulative layer are provided on the support as a unit layer or individually in that order, and the photoconductive insulative layer can be charged either positively or negatively. The desired lithographic printing plate can be prepared by treating the light sensitive material by the simple process of the inven tion.
