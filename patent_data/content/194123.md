# Modular distribution frame with protector structure and module for use therein.

## Abstract
A modular distribution frame for use in telecommunications is disclosed. The frame incorporates a overload protector element 32 which utilizes a printed circuit board as a primary contact structure. The frame is constructed of a number of individual modules 20 , each of which is front accessible for use in both wiring and test access. The structure incorporates a reversible wire guide to facilitate wiring of a module from either the right or left hand side of a particular mounting bracket 12 . The individual modules also use split cylinder insulation displacement connectors 46 which are readily accessible from the front of the module and terminate in spring fingers 50 which make contact to the overload protector elements.
