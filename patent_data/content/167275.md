# Semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory device includes an address change detection circuit TR₀, TR₁... and a pulse width control circuit PWC . The pulse width control circuit PWC inhibits the passage of write enable signals WE having a short pulse width for a predetermined time period after a change of address has occurred. After the predetermined period has elapsed the operation of the pulse width control circuit PWC is overridden and thus the write cycle time is reduced.
