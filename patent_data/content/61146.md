# NON VERBAL COMMUNICATION DEVICE

## Abstract
A device for facilitating non verbal communications between individuals. The device includes a two sided panel containing a plurality of message blocks which are selective ly illuminated by the individuals in a variety of modes. In a first mode, the message blocks are sequentially scanned in one of two patterns, with scan direction and termination being controlled by actuating a switch. In a second mode, a transparent, direct select keyboard is placed over the mes sage blocks and individual message blocks are selected by touching the keyboard in front of the block to be selected. Finally, the position of the illuminated message block may be controlled by a joy stick. The message blocks on the panel are printed on removable overlays which are specially adapted for various situations. The overlays carry identifying markings which are automatically read by the device so that the messages on the overlay, which are stored in non volatile memory, can be correlated to their position on the panel. The overlays include a number of special function blocks which, when selected, cause the device to operate a wheelchair, sound an audio alarm, communicate with a computer or other device through a serial I O port, or communicate ultrasonically with external devices. Each message block may include several different messages, with the message selected in that block being designated by a corresponding level selection block. The messages may be either letters or words, and the combination of letters and words may be accumulated in an alphanumeric display or a printer.
