# Alkyl perfluoro omega 2 iodoethoxy compounds and vinyl ethers therefrom.

## Abstract
Alkyl perfluoro Ï‰ 2 iodoethoxy compounds, vinyl ethers made therefrom, and a process for preparing the iodo compounds. The vinyl ether monomers when copolymerized with halogenated I olefins are useful to form elastomers, rigid articles, or membranes and films having ion exchange prop erties.
