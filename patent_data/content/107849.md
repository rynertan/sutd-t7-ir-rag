# A CYLINDER AND DIAL CIRCULAR KNITTING MACHINE PARTICULARLY FOR KNITTING HOSIERY

## Abstract
In a circular knitting machine of the cylinder and dial type, specially useful for knitting hosiery, the dial 5 is driven rotatively through a link rod 8 provided in the cylinder 2 interior and being rotatively rigid with the dial 5 . The link rod 8 is journaled about an axis perpendicular to the machine axis 12 , and has a bottom end engageable with a longitudinal inner groove 11 of the cylinder 2 . An actuating rod 14 , which is journaled with its bottom end to the link rod 8 and axially displaceable, permits the link rod 8 to be shifted between a position of engagement with the cylinder 2 and a position of disengagement therefrom, whereat the knitted fabric 9 may be discharged from the machine. In the engagement position, the fabric 9 is laid progressively onto the link rod 8 which, accordingly, will also drive the fabric 9 rotatively.
