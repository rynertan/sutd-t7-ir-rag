# FERRITE CORE MAGNETIC HEAD ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A magnetic head assembly includes a ferrite core 10 sandwiched between two ceramic layers 12, 14 . Alumina films 11, 13, 15, 17 are deposited by sputtering on the sides of the ferrite core and on the ceramic layers in one embodi ment, and on the ferrite core only in another embodiment, which are then bonded to form an integral head assembly. Slots 20, 22, 24, 26 to provide flying height control are formed in the air bearing surface of the ceramic layers. The process of making the assembly includes the steps of sputter etching the ferrite and ceramic prior to the deposition of the alumina.
