# Laminar electrical cells and batteries.

## Abstract
Laminar electrical cells and batteries of the LeClanche type especially adapted for service at high drain rates with var iable duty cycles by the inclusion of cathodes formed as slur ries of MnO₂ and carbon particles in an electrolyte comprising, by weight, about 2 of NH₄Cl, about 25 ZnCl₂, and the bal ance water with a minor amount of mercuric chloride.
