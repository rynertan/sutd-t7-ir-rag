# METHOD FOR QUANTITATIVELY DETERMINING THE LEVEL OF HEMOGLOBIN IN A BIOLOGICAL SAMPLE

## Abstract
A method of quantitatively determining the amount of hemoglobin in a biological material which includes the steps of preparing a test sample of the biological material by removing contaminating elements such as sources of interfering fluores cence, converting the hemoglobin in the test sample to por phyrin, performing an extraction step for the purpose of sepa rating the porphyrins derived from hemoglobin from various contaminants and determining the level of porphyrin in the test sample by means such as fluorescence assay.
