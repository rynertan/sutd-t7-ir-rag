# Apparatus for inserting wires into electrical contacts.

## Abstract
An electrical connector 82 having slotted plate contacts 84 arranged in two rows there along is supported beween heel blocks 52 and 72 on an anvil 40 , blocks 134 each carrying a wire insertion tooling assembly and being mounted on an arm 102 of a yoke, are transported along the anvil 40 by a stepping motor not shown connected to the yoke. Each tooling assembly is actuable to force a wire into the slot of a contact 84 when the tooling assembly is opposite to that contact. In order to align each tooling assembly with its associated contacts 84 despite warpage of the housing 83 of the con nector 82 , each tooling assembly is provided with an align ing plate 122 which rides on a longitudinal flange 88 of the connector housing 83 , the tooling assembly being capable of limited movement at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the anvil 40 .
