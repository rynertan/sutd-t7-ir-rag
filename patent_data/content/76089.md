## Description
ACTIVE COMPOUNDS This invention relates to novel compounds to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and to a process for their preparation. Racemic 3 3 hydroxyphenyl N n propylpiperidine 3 PPP is a known dopamine agonist which at lower dosages acts predominantly at presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors.At higher dosages one enantiomer acts as a postsynaptic dopamine agonist, whilst the other acts as a pOstynaptic dopamine antagonist.

The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I , which process comprises the reduction of a compound of the formula XXVIII EMI23.2 wherein E isEMI23.3 orEMI23.4 wherein the variables are as hereinbefore defined. R10 is hydroxyl or protected hydroxyl R11 is hydrogen, C14 alkyl, hydroxyl or protected hydroxyl R3 is R5 as defined in formula I or C17 alkanoyl a group CO CH2 xR13 where x is O or 1 and R13 is as defined in formula I or a group CO CH2 yR14 where y is O or 1 and R14 is as defined in formula I excluding C25 alkenyl and the remaining variables are as defined in formula I and as necessary converting R3 to R5 as desired or necessary converting R10 or R to R1 or R 11 11 1 2 respectively optionally converting R5 to other R5 and optionally salifying the resulting compound of the formula I . An R10 or R11 protected hydroxyl group is a conventional group readily convertible after a desired reaction to a hydroxyl group, and examples include C 1 4 alkoxy and in vivo hydrolysable acyloxy as defined and described for R1 and R2 in and under formula I and benzyloxy optionally substituted in the phenyl ring as for R5 when benzyl or phenethyl. Reduction may conveniently be effected in a single step using a metal electron acceptor reductive couple, such as lithium in liquid ammonia. When lithium liquid ammonia is used the reaction is conveniently quenched on completion using ammonium chloride. Alternatively, the reduction may be effected in two steps without necessarily isolating the relevant intermediate. Compounds of the formula XVII I may be converted by dehydration to compounds of formula XXIX EMI25.1 wherein the variables are as defined in formula XVIII Dehydration may be effected using a dilute strong acid, for example a dilute mineral acid such as dilute sulphuric acid. Moderate heating to a non extreme elevated temperatures for example between ambient and 900C, is advantageous.Extremes of acidity and temperature may cause polymerisation of the product and should therefore be avoided. Other suitable acids include strong organic acids in organic solvents, such as tosic acid in toluene. The compound of the formula XXIX is then reduced and as necessary R3 converted to R5, as desired or necessary,R10 or R11 converted to R1 or R2 respectively or R5 to otherR5 and the resulting compound of the formula I optionally salified. This process step forms an aspect of the present invention. The reduction of the compound of the formula XXIX is conveniently effected with conventional transition metal catalysed hydrogenation using mild reaction conditions whenR3 is optionally substituted benzyl as defined or R10 or R11 is optionally substituted benzyloxy as defined, and if it is desired to avoid removal of R3, R10 or R11. Platinum oxide or rhodium catalyst at atmospheric pressure or a slight excess thereover is suitable. For other R3, R10 or R11, or if R3,R10 or R11 retention is not desired, less mild conditions may be used, for example palladium or platinum charcoal, at atmospheric pressure or a slight excess thereover. Ambient temperatures are apt, as are dry inert polar solvents, such as dry ethanol.If R3 optionally substituted henzvl is removed the resultant secondary amine NH may be converted toNR5 by conventional alkylation or by acylation and reduction. When R3 is C 1 7 alkanoyl, C3 8 cycloalkyl C 1 2 alkanoyl or C37 alkenoyl, conversion to the corresponding R5 may be effected by reductive acylation, for example by reaction with the corresponding acid in the presence of an inorganic hydride reductant such as sodium borohydride. Conversion to R5 methyl may be effected with formaldehyde in the presence of a mild reductant such as sodium cyanoborohydride in an inert highly polar solvent such as acetonitrile. When R3 is aryl C 1 2 alkanoyl as defined it is more convenient to effect acylation with the acyl halide and to reduce the product with a strong inorganic hydride reductant such as lithium aluminium hydride. When R10 or R11 when a protected hydroxyl group, is of the form R120, where R12 is C 1 4 alkyl, conversion of 10 or R11 to R1 or R2 hydroxyl respectively is conveniently carried out by treatment with pyridine hydrochloride, boron tribromide or boron triiodide or iodotrimethylsilane, or by warming with aqueous hydrobromic acid, When R12 is C1 6 alkanoyl or benzoyl optionally substituted as defined deprotection may be effected conventionally, for example by acidic or basic hydrolysis. When R12 is optionally substituted benzyl as defined above conversion is conveniently effected by conventional methods such as transition metal catalysed hydrogenolysis using for example palladium or platinum charcoal, at atmospheric pressure or a slight excess thereover. This method is not apt for R5 optionally substituted benzyl, which will also tend to be removed. Compounds of the formula I wherein R1 and optionally R2 are C1 4 alkoxy or in vivo hydrolysable acyloxy are derivable from those wherein R1 and R2 are hydroxy by conventional O alkylation or esterification reactions respectively. The reaction may be carried out under conventionalO alkylation conditions, using a compound of the formulaR12 1Q where R112 is C 1 4 alkyl and Q is a group readily displaced by a nucleophile. Suitable examples of Q include halide such as C1, Br or I or labile sulphonate groups such s OSO2CH3 or OSO2.C6H4.p CH3. The reaction is generally effected in an inert solvent, at a non extreme temperature such as ambient or slightly elevated temperature, for example solvent reflux temperature. It will be appreciated by the skilled man thatO alkylation of compounds of the formula I may also lead to quaternary N alkylation of the NR5 moiety unless theN atom is protected, for example by carrying out acylation in the presence of a strong acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, so that the nitrogen function is protected by protonation.The acid may conveniently also act as the solvent. For in vivo hydrolysable esters the reaction may be carried out under conventional esterification condition using a compound of the formula Rê12W wherein Rê12 is an acyl group capable of forming an in vivo hydrolysable acyloxy group and W is for example halide, such as chloride acyloxy, such as C14 alkanoyloxy or hydroxyl. R2 may typically be the acyl group corresponding 12 to R1 and R2 in vivo hydrolysable acyloxy groups described under formula I . When W is halide the reaction is generally carried out in the presence of a base when W is hydroxyl it is generally effected in the presence of a dehydrating agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The reaction is generally effected in an inert solvent at non extreme temperatures such as ambient or slightly elevated temperature, for example solvent reflux temperature. It will be appreciated that all the above interconversions may also be carried out in intermediates which are not of formula I or in the compounds of formulae XXVIII or XXIX themselves. From the foregoing it will be appreciated that this invention also provides a third process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which process comprises the deprotection of a compound of the formula XXX . EMI29.1 wherein R10 is protected hydroxy R1 is hydrogen, C14 alkyl or protected hydroxy 11 and the remaining variables are as defined in formula I and thereafter optionally O alkylating or O acylating with an acyl group capable of forming an in vivo hydrolysable acyloxy group, the resultant compound and optionally salifying the resultant compound. Suitable process conditions are as so described for the relevant first process steps hereinbefore. The reduction of the compound of formula XXIX may remove benzyl groups as defined. The present invention thus provides a fourth process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I , comprising reacting a compound of formula XXXI . EMI30.1 with a compound of the formula XXXII Q R3 XXXII wherein R10 is hydroxy or protected hydroxy R11 is hydrogen, C14 alkyl, hydroxy or protected hydroxy Q is a group readily displaceable by a nucleophile and the remaining variables are as hereinbefore defined and as necessary converting R3 to R 5. as desired or necessary converting R10 or R11 to R1 orR2 respectively converting R1, R2 or R5 to other R1, R2 or R5 and optionally salifying the resulting compound of the formula I . Suitable examples of Q include halide such as C1, Br or I, when R3 is R5 as defined Q may also be labile sulphonyloxy such as OS02CH3 or OSO2. C6H4.p.CH3, when R3 is other than R5 Q may also be C1 6 alkanoyloxy such as acetoxy, or hydroxy. The condensation of the compounds of the formulae XXXI and XXXII is conveniently effected in an inert aprotic solvent such as an ether, for example THF, or a halohydrocarbon, for example dichloromethane, or in a mixture of such solvents, at a non extreme temperature. Compounds of formula XXXI are novel, and as such form an aspect of the invention. The reaction generally eliminates an acid, and it is thus often preferable to effect it in the presence of a base such as a mild inorganic base, for example potassium carbonate or a stronger organic base, for example triethylamine. The variable interconversions may be effected as hereinbefore described. The acid addition salts of compounds of the formula I may be prepared in entirely conventional manner by reacting a compound of the formula I in base form with the chosen acid. The compound of formula XXVIII is conveniently prepared as described hereinafter and reacted in situ without intermediate isolation. Compounds of the formula XXVIII may be prepared by the reaction of a compound of formula XXXIII EMI31.1 wherein R10 is protected hydroxyl R11 is hydrogen, C1 4 alkyl or protected hydroxyl and M is a magnesium II halide group, preferably magnesium II bromide, or lithium with a compound of the formula XXXIV EMI32.1 or wherein the variables are as defined in formula I , and thereafter as defined or necessary converting R1 or R1 10 11 to R10 or R11 as defined. When M is a magnesium II halide group, the compound of formula XXVIII may be prepared in situ under conventional conditions for Grignard reagents. Those are reaction of the halide, preferably the bromide, corresponding to the compound of formula XXXIII with a molar equivalent or excess of dry, grease free magnesium particles in a dry ether, for example THF dimethoxyethane or diethyl ether, free of protic solvents. THF is a preferred solvent. The presence of trace quantities of dibromoethane may be advantageous.Ambient and non extreme depressed temperatures are suitable, for example between ambient and 150C, although gentle initiative heating may be advantageous. When M is lithium, the compound of formula XXVIII may be prepared in situ under conventional indirect metallation conditions, for example by reaction of the above corresponding halide, preferably the bromide with n butyl lithium.Temperatures of ambient to 600C are suitable. The completed reaction is conveniently quenched with water. It will be appreciated that any hydroxy group in R6 is best protected and if desired deprotected after the coupling, as described hereinbefore. Compounds of the formula XXXIII are derivable by conventional metallation or Grignard reactions from the corresponding compound where M is replaced by halide, preferably bromide. These corresponding halo compounds are known compounds or derivable conventionally from or preparable analogously to known compounds. Depending on reaction steric factors the compounds of the formulae I or XXVIII , XXX and XXXI may be synthesised having an axial or equatorial substitution orientation at the azabicycle 2 position, or as a mixture of such forms in infinitely variable ratio. By way of example the reduction of a compound of the formula may give a mixture of both isomers. Such mixtures may be separated conventionally, e.g. by chromatography or fractional crystallisation. The latter method on an acid addition salt is especially useful where the corresponding compound of formula XXVIII is liquid under ambient conditions. When reaction conditions cause the production of the axial isomer, this may if desired be converted to the corresponding equatorial isomer by treatment with a strong base, for example butyl lithium, optionally complexed with tetramethylethylenediamine. Each such diastereomer also exists in two enantiomeric forms by virtue of the non symmetric substitution of the azabicycle. Specific enantiomers may be obtained by using chiral starting materials, or compounds of the formula I may be synthesised from racemic intermediates and their enantiomers resolved conventionally e.g. by salification with a chiral acid and salt separation. It is often convenient to synthesise the compounds of the formula I non stereospecifically and non chirally from diastereomeric and or enantiomeric mixtures and to separate and or resolve the compounds of the formula I . Compounds of the formula XXXIV may be synthesised from compounds of the formula XXXV EMI34.1 wherein the variables are as hereinbefore defined, by the following conventional steps EMI34.2 remainder of rings omitted for clarity Compounds of the formula XXXV may be synthesised from compounds of the formula XXXVI EMI35.1 wherein R17 is an organyl radical for example C14 alkyl and the remaining variables are as hereinbefore defined, by the following conventional steps EMI35.2 The dehydration step may be effected as described hereinbefore for compounds of formulae XXIX . Compounds of formula XXXVI wherein E is EMI35.3 as defined may be prepared by the reaction of a compound of formula XXXVII . H2N R5 XXXVII wherein R3 is as hereinbefore defined, with a corresponding dialdehyde of formula XXXVIII EMI36.1 and an acetone 1,3 dicarboxylic monoester, such as a C14 alkyl monoester, and thereafter if necessary converting R5 to R3, by conventional methods. The reaction is an example of the Robinson Schopf reaction and is preferably carried out at a pH of 5 in a solution of sodium acetate buffer in water. Compounds of formula XXXVII and 1,3 acetone dicarboxylic acid monoesters are known compounds. The compounds of formula XXXVIII,are known or can be prepared analogously to the preparation of known compounds. Compounds of formula XXXVI , wherein, when n 0, one of R6 and R7 is 1 4 alkyl and the other is hydrogen or C14 alkyl, and wherein, when n 1, R6, R7 and R8 are as hereinbefore defined, and R5 is as hereinbefore defined, can be prepared by reacting a known compound of formulaEMI36.2 wherein R6 to R8 and n are as defined, with a compound of formula XXXVII EMI37.1 wherein R5 is as hereinbefore defined, and an acetone 1,3dicarboxylic acid monoester under the same Robinson Schopf conditions, and thereafter if desired converting R5 to R3. Compounds of formula XXXIX , wherein one of R6 and R7 is C 1 4 alkyl and the other is hydrogen or C1 4 alkyl and n is 0, can be prepared by the hydrolysis of a compound of formula XL EMI37.2 wherein one of R6 and R1 is C1 4 alkyl and 6 7 1 4 kyl and the other is hydrogen or C14 alkyl. The compound of formula XL can be prepared by the catalytic hydrogenation of a compound of formula XLI EMI37.3 1 1 wherein R6 and R7 are as defined for formula XL . The catalytic hydrogenation is usually carried out with hydrogen and palladium on charcoal in methanol. Compounds of formula XXXVI , wherein one of R6 and R7 is hydroxy and the other is hydrogen or C 1 4 alkyl and n is 0, can be prepared by the acid hydrolysis of a compound of formula XLII EMI38.1 2 2 wherein one of R6 and R7 is hydrogen and the other is hydrogen or C 1 4 alkyl. Compounds of formula XLI and XLII can be prepared from a compound of formula XLIII EMI38.2 2 2 1 1 wherein R6 and R7 are either respectively R6 and R7 as 2 defined for formula XL or are respectively R6 and R7 as defined for formula XLII , by reaction with bromine and methanol followed by basification. The reaction of a compound of formula XLIII with bromine and methanol is normally carried out at about 400C, and the subsequent basification is carried out with ammonia or sodium carbonate. Compounds of formula X.XXIX , wherein n is 1 and R6,R7 and R8 are as hereinbefore defined, can be prepared by acidolysis of a compound of formula XLIV EMI39.1 wherein R6 to R8 are as hereinbefore defined, when n 1, in accordance with the procedure described by K. Alder et al in Annal., 626, 73 1959 . Compounds of formula XLIV are known compounds or are derivable therefrom or can be prepared analogously to the preparation of known, structurally similar compounds. The compounds of the formula I are dopamine agonists. Some are also adrenoceptor agonists. The compounds may act at both presynaptic and postsynaptic receptors. Depending on their balance between action at presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors and action at postsynaptic dopamine receptors respectively, the compounds may be used in the treatment of central nervous system disorders related to excess dopamine release, such as psychosis, for example schizophrenia, and Huntington s chorea, and hyperkinetic and dyskinetic disorders, or in the treatment of central nervous system disorders related to deficient dopamine release, such as Parkinson s disease and hyperprolactinaemic syndromes,. As dopamine agonists, the compouns may also be used as mood modifiers in the treatment of CNS disorders, in particular the treatment of anxiety. In common with other agonists, including the enantiomer of the presynaptically acting dopamine agonist 3 PPP, compounds of the formula I may be dopamine antagonists, in particular acting post synaptically, at higher doses, that is at doses towards the upper end of the dosage ranges mentioned hereinafter. As post synaptic dopamine antagonists the compounds may be used in the treatment of dopamine excess related disorders, such as described above. The particular profile of any given compound may be readily ascertained by routine pharmacological tests of the types described hereinafter or well known to the skilled man.Thus for example agonist activity at presynaptic autoreceptors may be ascertained by the compounds inhibition of spontaneous climbing behaviour in the mouse agonist activity at postsynaptic receptors by an increase in spontaneous climbing behaviour in the mouse and antagonist activity at postsynaptic receptors by inhibition of apomorphine dopamine agonist induced climbing in the mouse. Compounds of the formula X are believed to have an activity profile in which presynaptic agonist activity predominates, in some cases to the extent that they may be regarded as selectively presynaptic. The invention therefore also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula I , a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a solvate of the compound or its salt, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such compositions may be adapted for oral or parenteral administration, and as such may be in the form of tablets, capsules, oral liquid preparations, powders, granules, lozenges, reconstitutable powders, injectable and infusable solutions or suspensions the compositions may also be in the form of suppositories.Normally, orally adminsitrable compositions are preferred. Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dose presentation form, and may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, fillers, tabletting lubricants, disintegrants and acceptable wetting agents and the like. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice.Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspension, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, or may be presented in a dry product of reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additivies such as suspending agents, emulsifying agents, non aqueous vehicles which may include edible oils , preservatives, and if desired conventional flavouring or colouring agents. For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilising the compound of the formula I and a sterile vehicle. The compound, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparation solutions the compound can be dissolved for injection and filter sterilisied before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, preservatives and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilised by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound. As is common practice, the compositions will usually be accompanied by written or printed directions for use in the medical treatment concerned. It will of course be realised that the precise dosage used in the treatment of any of the hereinbefore described disorders will depend on the actual compound of the formula I used, and also on other factors such as the seriousness of the disorder being treated. The invention further provides a method of treatment of dopamine dependent CNS disorders in mammals including humans comprising the administration of an effective amount of a compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a solvate of compound or salt.The effective amount will depend in the usual way on a number of factors such as the nature and severity of the malady to be treated, the weight of the sufferer, and actual compound used. However by way of illustration, unit doses will suitably contain 0.01 to 20mg of the compound of formula I , for example 0.02 to 1Omg. Again by way of illustration, such unit doses will suitably be administered more than once a day, for example, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 times a day, in such a way that the total daily dose is suitably in the range 0.0005 to 1Omg kg per day.

It is believed that this inhibitory effect is mediated by stimulation of presynaptic dopaminergic autoreceptors, i.e. receptors whose stimulation results in inhibition of dopamine synthesis and electrical activity of dopamine neurones. Spontaneous climbing behaviour was assessed by the method of M.P. Martres et al., Brain Research, 1977, 136, 319. This involves the monitoring of the frequency of climbing behaviour of mice in inverted food hoppers over a 10 minute period commencing 3 minutes after subcutaneous administration of compound. A climb is defined as the mouse having all four feet off the ground. Experiments are carried out with a minimum of 5 groups of 10 mice, one group acting as control. The number of climbs exhibited by the drug treated group is expressed as a percentage change from the number exhibited by the control group.
