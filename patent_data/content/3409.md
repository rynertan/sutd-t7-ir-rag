## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING 4 AMINO METHYLBICYCLO 2,2,2 OCTOL1 CARBONYLIC ACID AND INTERMEDIATE COMPOUND TRIFLUOR This invention relates to the production of 4 aminomethylbicyclo 2,2,2 octane 1 carboxylic acid, which in known useful compound having a high anti plasmin activity. The conventional process for producing 4 aminomethylbicyclo 2,2,2 octane 1 carboxylic acid comprises desulfurizing the bisethylenethioketal of an ester of bicyclo 2,2,2 octa 2,5dione 1,4 dicarboxylic acid to form a bicyclo 2,2,2 octane1,4 dicarboxylic ester, partially hydrolysing this compound, forming the corresponding amide, dehydrating the amide, hydrolysing to ferm 4 cyanobicyclo 2,2,2 octane 1 carboxylic acid, and reducing the latter see United States Patent No 3,634,499, issued January 11, 1972 for further details of This process . Bowever, this process is not industrially advatageous because it consists of many steps and rencires complicated operation, and o erall yield of the end product is poor. For exarple, according to the process disclosed in United StatesPatent No. 3,634,499, the preparation of the intermediate bicyclo 2,2,2 octane 1,4 dicarboxylic acid ester requires many steps as well as the use of various auxiliary materials such as ethanol 1,2 dithiol, which is toxic, Raney mickel, which is used in a large amount, and chlorocarbonic ester, which is expensive. In addition, fire more steps are needed for producing the end product from the intermediate ester. Intensive investigations have been carried out to find processes for producing 4 aminomethylbicyclo 2,2,2 octane lcarboxylic acid without using the above described disadvantageous interDediate compound. The present invention is based on the discovery that by reacting 4 cyanocyclohexa l,3 diene l carboxylic acid or a lower alkyl ester thereof Formula I with ethylene to form 4 cyanobicyclo 2,2,2 oct 2 en 1 carboxylic acid or a lower alkyl ester thereof Formula II and catalytically reducing and where the ester is used hydrolysing the compound of Formula II, the end compound represented by Formula IV can quite easily be obtained as shorn below.EMI2.1 in each formula, R is hydrogen or a lower alkyl group The intermediate compounds, 4 cyanobicyclo 2,2,2 oct 2 en 1carboxylic acid and its lower alkyl esters, have previously been prepared according to the methods described in J. Org. Chem., 30, 1431 1965 and J. Org. Chem., 32, 3344 1967 , but these methods are not satisfactory. The lower alkyl groups mentioned herein are preferably methyl or ethyl but may contain up to 5 or 6 carbon atoms. The first step of the process of this invention involves the reaction for forming the bicyclo 2,2,2 octane ring. The mechanism of this process is the so called DielsAlder Reaction. A similar example to the reaction of the present invention is disclosed in Example 4 of U.S. Patent No.3,688,005, issued August 29, 1972, in which methyl 4 cyanocyclo hexa l, 3 diene l carboxylate is reacted with vinyl chloride to produce l cyano 4 methoxycarbonyl 5 or 6 chlorobicyclo 2,2,2 oct 2 ene. The industrial advantage of this process is not clear insofar as it is difficult to determine the reaction pressure accurately because complicated equipment must be used moreover, this document makes no mention of the yield of the end product. In the Diels Alder reaction, the atmosphere of electrons around the two carbon atoms at the double bond site associated with the reaction should be unstable. Alternatively, these two carbon atoms should be easily chargeable, either positively or negatively, by an electron attracting or electron repelling functional substituent linked to these carbon atoms. Such a substituent may be a halogen atom or a cyano group.The best knows example of a dienophile is maleic acid anhydride. A symetrical molecule such as unsubstituted ethylene would therefore be thought to be rather unsuitable because its dienophilic activity would be expected to be lower than that of, say, vinyl chloride Accordingly, to obtain satisfactory results using ethylene as he dienophile would not be expected from consideration of the prior reaction using vinyl chloride.The aforementioned reference, J. Org. Chem., 0, 1431 1965 discloses a method of producing 1,4 disubstituted bicyclo 2,2,2 oct 2 en by using ethylene as the dienophile. but this method requires the use of a special high pressure reactor since the reaction of 1,3 cyclohexadiene 1,4 dicarboxylate with ethylene to yield dimethyl hicyclo 2,2,2 oct 22 en 1,4 dicarbolrylate requires a pressure as high as 1000 kg cm2. Under consideration of such conventional techniques, it was believed that the reaction of ethylene with 4 cyanocyclohexa 1,3 diene 1 carboxylic acids would not proceed at all, or would require a very high pressure, or would not produce the end product in a high yield. Surprisingly however, it turned out that the 4 cyanobicyclo 2,2,2 oct 2 ene l carboxylic acids would be obtained in a high yield under a pressure very much lower than had been expected. To be more specific, the minimum pressure required for the reaction involved in the process of the present invention is 30 kg cmê. The preferred range is form 60 to 300 kg cmê. The reaction proceeds at a temperature of 100 to 250 C under a pressure within the range defined above and provides a high yield of the end product. A special apparatus is therefore not required but a conventional pressure vessel can be used. The reaction of the present invention may proceed with or without a solvent or catalyst.The purpose of optionally adding a catalyst is to accelerate the rate of the reaction, and suitable catalysts include Lewis acids.Examples of suitable solvents, if used, are aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and stlene, halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform and dichlorethane, and hydrocarbons such as hexane and pentane. aydroquinonc or t butvlcatechol may also be used to prevent the occurrence of polymerization. The second step of the process of this invention is a catalytic reduction, in which the compound of Formula II, dissolved in an organic solvent that may or may not contain a small amount of water, such as methanole, ethanol, butanol, ether, dioxane or tetrahydrofuran is catalytically reduced in a hydrogen atmosphere in the presence of a metal catalyst such as platinum, platinum oxide, ruthenium, Panes nickel, or Raney cobalt so as to simul taneously effect the reduction of the cyano group and the reduction of bicyclo 2,2,2 octene to bicyclo 2,2,2 octane, with the result that the compound of Formula III is obtained. It is sometimes advantageous to use platinum or platinum oxide in the presence of acidic materials such as hydrochloric acid and acetic acid, and also to use ruthenium, Raney nickel or Raney cobalt in the presence of alkaline materials such as ammonia and sodium carbonate.Additionally, when using certain kinds of catalyst, the reduction may be advantageously carried out under pressure or at elevated temperatures. The third step of the process of this invention compriscs bydrolysing the compound III , when the ester group is present, in the presence of an acid or alkali to provide salt of the end compound IV . When the salt is neutralized by a conventional method, for example, using an ion exchange resin, the compound is obtained in its free form. Therefore, according to the process of this invention, the end compound IV , which it has conventionally required many steps to produce, can be manufactured by fewer steps without using a special reactor of the type that withstands a pressure as high as 1000 atmospheres. In this connection, the comppund I used as the starting material for the process of this invention can be easily prepared by the following method. 4 Cyanocyclohexane 1 carboxylic acid chloride is bromi nated to form 1,4 dibromo 4 cyanocyclohexane 1 carboxylic acid chloride, esterified with methanol, treated kith pyridine to remove the hydrogen bromide so as to provide methyl 4 cyanocyclohexa 1,3 diene 1 carboxylate boiling point 101 103 C 1 .
