# Process for producing cyclodextrins.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for producing cyc lodextrins without using any organic solvents i.e. by non solvent process. According to this invention, a sugar solution containing cyclodextrins and reducing sugars as primary ingredients is brought into contact with i a hydrophobic, synthetic adsorption resin comprising a porous polymer, ii a strongly acidic cation exchange resin or iii a strongly acidic catton exchange resin followed by gel resin particles, to thereby isolate α, β or γ cyclodextrins or a mixture thereof from the sugar solution.
