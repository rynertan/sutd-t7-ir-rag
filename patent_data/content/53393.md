The editing device 4, as shown in FIG. 3 in detail, comprises an analyzing processing unit 43 for carrying out analyzation according to a work 40 and a constant file 41 with data from the floppy disk 3 as input data, to form a layout data file 42 as intermediate data an editing processing unit 46 for setting up notes and symbols according to the constant file 41 and the layout data file 42, to form a correction file 45 a correcting processing unit 48 for processing correction data 47 to adjust the positions of notes or the like in the correction file 45 and an outputting processing unit 49 for setting up data from the correction file 45 according to the constant file 41 and outputting the data thus set up to the magnetic tape 5. The input data 31 are to specify a layout container, and kinds and positions of notes to be set up.The constant file 41 includes common information such as film sizes and note points sizes which can be changed as desired. The layout data file 42 is an input file to the editing processing unit 46, which includes edition instruction information and data groups. The correction file 45 includes edition result information which is edited by the editing processing unit 46, carrying out the proof of note positions or the like.The music codes MC stored in the magnetic tape 5 are inputted to the photo composing machine 7 where they are printed on a file or a photographic printing paper. A fundamental layout function according to the invention will be described. Four film sizes, A4, A5, B4 and B5 are employed in the invention and are selectively used. A reference point RP for setting positions on a page is set at an upper left position on a page which is so set that its longer sides are vertical as shown in FIG. 4. The music layout container can set at a given position x1, Y1 x2, y2 or x3, y3 from the reference point RP that is, it can set a stage, large staff, score, record, bar, record length and record width as desired. As shown in the part A of FIG. 4, the term stage is intended to mean the combination of a plurality of staffs for a performance with a plurality of musical instruments the term large staff is intended to mean the combination of a violin staff and a buss staff for a performance with the piano and the organ the term score is intended to mean the combination of some staffs for a chorus music or concerted music performance and the term record is intended to mean each staff in a stage. The space between records is referred to as a record space . Furthermore, the term bar is intended to mean the space between adjacent bars in a record. The length of a bar is referred to as a bar length . The term record length is intended to mean a length in a direction in which notes in a record are described. The term record width is equal to the distance between the first and fifth lines of a staff. The bar can be divided into equal parts according to beats, and each part is referred to as a column . The length of a column is referred to as a column length . The layout container is set according to the stage start point x,y , the record width, the number of records, the record space, the record length, the number of stages, and the stage space. The layout is carried out by repeatedly setting the same layout container until the music is ended. Only the number of stages and the stage start point x,y for page 1 can be changed. The number of bars in each stage is determined in editing however, the stage may be changed forcibly by specify ing more than one bar. The tops of records in a stage are connected with one continuous line DS which may be called a stage top line DS , and the score and the large staff are connected with a bracket DG and a brace CG, respectively.In the case where the score and the large staff are overlapped, they are set up in the order of a bracket and a brace, and their layout positions are at fixed distances from the stage start point. The record is provided by drawing five parallel lines the width of each line being fixed according to the record width as long as the record length from the line DS. A tone symbol is set at the top of the record. That is, a violin symbol, bass symbol, alto symbol, tenor symbol, soprano symbol, mezzo soprano symbol and baritone symbol are selectively specified to be set at the top of the record. In the case where a temporary tone symbol is present between notes in a record, the tone symbol for the next record and so forth is changed to the temporary tone symbol, and its layout position is fixed according to the record width. Three different symbols, sharp num , flat b and natural Q are employed as key signatures. The editing processing unit 46 determines the key signature layout position according to the tone symbol and the number of layout positions. Only the natural and sharp symbols or the natural and flat symbols may exist mixedly, and the layout is started with the natural symbol.The layout is effected in units of bars, and it is not carried out if a key signature in a record is the same as that in the preceding record. Numerals 1 , 2 , , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 or 64 can be used as the denominator of a beat symbol, and any integer of from 1 to 50 can be used as the numerator.The layout of the beat symbol is effected for each bar, but if a beat symbol in a bar is the same as that in the preceding bar, the layout of the beat symbol is not carried out for that bar. Two beat symbols can be laid out simultaneously. In the case where the key signature is changed beginning from the top bar in the next stage, a new key signature is set in the end of the record of that stage. In the case where the beat symbol is changed beginning from the top bar in the next stage, a new beat symbol is set at the end of the record of that stage.When both the key signature and the beat symbol are changed,a new key signature and a new beat symbol are set. A bar line is drawn at the end of a bar. A vertical line as shown in the part A of FIG. 5, a double vertical line as shown in the part B , repeat marks as shown in the parts C through F , a double bar as shown in the part G and a dummy bar line not printed are selectively specified. A bar line in a large staff is one ruler line. In the case where a bar line at the end of a record is the repeat mark as shown in the part D of FIG. 5, it is changed into a vertical line, and the repeat mark as shown in the part D of FIG. 5 is set at the top of the next bar. In the case where a bar line at the end of a bar is the repeat mark as shown in the part F of FIG. 5, it is changed into the repeat mark as shown in the part C , and the repeat mark in the part D is set at the top of the next bar. Simple notes, simple rests, dotted notes, dotted, rests, double dotted notes, and double dotted rests can be set. The simple notes of from a whole note to a 64th note can be set, and the simple rests of from a whole rest to a 64th note can be set. The dotted notes of from a dotted whole note to a dotted 64th note can be set. The dotted rests of from a dotted whole rest to a dotted 64th rest, the double dotted notes of from a double dotted whole note to a double dotted 64th note, and the double dotted rests of from a double dotted whole rest to a double dotted 64th rest can be set. It should be noted that all kinds of printing patterns are not provided for the notes. A note is formed by combining a note head, a note tail and a dot. The vertical line of a note is formed by a ruler line.Printing patterns are provided for the rests except for the dots. A basic column length in a bar can be calculated from the following expression 1 Basic column length basic note x space shortest note in bar 1 where the space is the distance between the heads of adjacent shortest notes, and the basic note is the note which is indicated by the denominator of a beat symbol. The basic measure length can be obtained by multiplying the basic column length by the number of the beat, and further adding a key signature, a time signature or some space within the measure, if necessary. In the case where a stage consists of a plurality of records, the basic bar lengths of the records are obtained, and the longest of the basic bar lengths is employed as the basic bar length of that bar. The layout position of the top note in a bar is on the column start point in the direction x of the first column and is therefore not affected by a temporary symbol or an ornament note.The layout positions of the notes in a bar are determined relative to the respective column start points. The length of a note set the position of a note to be set next can be obtained from the following expression 2 Length basic column length x basic note set note ...................... 2 In the case where the sum of lengths exceeds the basic column length, a value obtained by subtracting the basic column length from the sum of lengths represents a layout relative position from the column start point of the next column. The layout position of a rest is as shown in FIG. 6. The dots of dotted notes are put rightside of the note when the note head locates between lines, and are put between lines when the note head locates on a line. A note vertical line is extended upwardly or downwardly, and the direction of a note vertical line can be determined according to the results of edition and can be changed for each bar. As a result of the edition, where a note head is above the third line, the note vertical line is extended downwardly where it is below the third line, the note vertical line is extended upwardly and where it is on the third line, the note vertical line is extended downwardly. A plurality of notes different in pitch which can be produced simultaneously for instance with the piano can be handled as one note cf. Al in the part A of FIG. 1 . However, these notes are set beginning with the lowest note. If there is a second difference between adjacent notes, the notes are set on both sides of the note vertical line. In the case where the direction of the note vertical line is determined according to the edition, the layout of the notes is determined according to where the average of the pitches of the notes is located in the staff. The layout is carried out for each bar. The first bars in the records of a stage are set up beginning with the top record, and similarly the second bars and the third bars and so forth are set up as 1 2 3 4 5 6 in the part A of FIG. 1 . In the case where a note or a note head is set above or below the staff, an additional line AL is inserted as shown in the part C of FIG. 1 however, where a note is set immediately above or below the staff, no additional line is inserted.Five kinds of temporary symbols sharp, flat, natural, double sharp and double flat symbols are available.These symbols are set at the left sides of respective notes or note heads . In the case where temporary symbols are set for plural notes different in pitch, the temporary symbols should be set in a lateral direction beginning with the note which is highest in pitch. However, in the case where the difference in pitch is of the fifth, the temporary symbols are set vertically.If there is no space for setting a temporary symbols for a note between that note and the preceding note, then the layout position of that note, the column length and the bar length should be changed. If a temporary symbol should be set for a note which is on the column start point, the column start point after that column and the column length of the preceding column should be changed.If it is required to set a temporary symbol for a note located in a column, then the layout positions of notes after that note in the column, the column length of the column and the column start points of the succeeding columns should be changed. Three kinds of ornament notes S1 in the part B of FIG. 1 and S2 in the part C of FIG. 1 long appoggiatura, short appoggiatura andsdouble appogiatura are available. The space between double appoggiatura notes is a half 1 2 of the space which is obtained by calculating the lengths of the notes as those of ordinary notes. A temporary symbol accompanying an ornament note is set similarly as in the case where it accompanies an ordinary note. Now, the edition and layout of a serial note will be described. There are two types of serial notes one of which is shown as R1 in FIG. 1 B , and the other is shown as R2 in FIG.1 C . The former will be referred to as a serial note 1 , and the latter as a serial note 2 . In the edition of a serial note 1, the note vertical lines of the two notes at both ends are connected with a line. First, the angle a of the line KL is obtained from the following expression 3 EMI13.1 ............... 3 where a is the distance between two notes, and b is the difference in level between the tops of the note ertical lines, as shown in FIG. 7. The two notes are connected with the line KL at the obtained angle a . Then, the coordinates x,y of the two notes are determined with a bar start point as the original point 0. It is assumed that the coordinates Pn of the n th note in a serial note is xn,yn . In the case of a pure tone, the note coordinate position is at the note head and in the case of a chord, the coordinate position is at the average thereof.A left average coordinates PL xL,yL and a right average coordinates PR xR,yR will be defined as follows If the number of notes is represented by N, then N 2m or N 2m 1 where m is the natural number EMI14.1 tb xL SEP x tb XL SEP SEP xl tb SEP SEP n SEP SEP 1 tb m tb JL SEP m SEP ss tb OR SEP ON tb SEP N tb SEP n SEP SEP m l SEP n tb When SEP N SEP SEP 2m, SEP m SEP 5 tb SEP N tb SEP C SEP m SEP Y, tb When SEP N SEP SEP 2m SEP SEP 1, SEP YR SEP SEP n m SEP n tb SEP m SEP tb The inclination a of the line is yR yL alpha .............. 6 xR xL Thirteen inclination 6 10, 5 10, .... and 6 10 of the line can be actually printed.Among these inclinations, one most closest to the expression 6 is employed. If, even when an inclination is calculated as 0 10, the value of the expression 6 is not zero 0 , then a minimum inclination 1 10 or 1 10 is employed.Furthermore, when the value Yn is naturally increased or decreased as shown in the part A or B of FIG. 9, the minimum inclination value is set to 1 10 or 1 10, in order that the line inclination is made smaller than the inclination of a line which connects the note heads as shown in the part A of FIG. 10 or that the line is set horizontal irrespective the positions of the two notes at both ends. In the case where a serial note consists of notes different in duration time, the range is obtained according to the length of longer notes, and is set to a note immediately before another note which is longer than the note to be lately set as shown in FIG. 11 A , B , and where a shorter note exists separately this note is set as a note of predetermined length without connecting vertical lines of notes as shown in FIG. 12 A through D . The note vertical lines in the serial note 1 may be extended upwardly or downwardly. The layout position of the serial note 2 is set similarly as in the ordinary note however, the notes in the range are handled as a beat number different from the ordinary one, and the column length of that column and the column start points of the succeeding columns are renewed.The centers of the top and last notes in the range are connected withEMI16.1 , and a serial note number 1, 2, 3 .... or 9 is set in the blank at the center of ll EMI16.2 . When notes are set in a record, the record may have a blank region at the end portion. The blank region is equally distributed over the bars therein, so that the record ends are in alignment with one another.In the case of the ordinary record, the blank region at the end portion is equally distributed over the bars in the record, and a part of the blank region distributed to a bar is proportionally distributed between the notes with the shorted note as a reference. Adjustment of the last record is carried out according to a predetermined allowance PL and the length EL of a blank region at the end portion of the record. In the case of PL 5 EL, similarly as in the case of the abovedescribed ordinary record, the blank region is allowed to be absorbed by the bars. In the case of PL EL, adjustment of the blank region is not carried out that is, the length of the last record is reduced. In the case of a sheet music including at least two parts in one record similarly as in a chorus music, the parts are edited as different bars and combined together cf. FIG. 13 . In combination of bars smaller than a beat number, the shortage is complemented with a dummy rest. The dummy rest is not outputted on a film or a printing paper a blank region corresponding to the duration of the dummy rest is obtained, and the next note dummy rest is set. In addition to notes, other various symbols concerning tone stresses and durations must be used to form a sheet music. These will be described below For the entirety of a music, only a speed symbol is employed. The layout position is at the fixed position of the first bar in the first record as indicated by HE in the part A of FIG. 1. A symbol such as segno or fermata pause accompanying a bar is set with the center of the symbol above the bar line as indicated by SN in the part B of FIG. 1. In the case of a double bar, the layout is made with the rear edge of the character aligned with the bar line. A symbol such as D.S. dal segno , D.C. da capo or Fine fine is set with the rear edge of the symbol below the bar line as indicated by A2 in the part B of FIG. 1.A symbol v breathing is set on the fifth line and between the relevant note and the preceding note, as indicated by A3 in the part B of FIG. 1.An arpeggio symbolEMI17.1 orEMI17.2 is set at the left handed side of a note as indicated by A4 in the part C of FIG. 1. The length of the symbol should be equal to the distance between note heads, and in the case where a temporary symbol such as a sharp symbol is used, the arpeggio symbol is set at the lefthanded side of the temporary symbol. Symbols 5 sforzando , . staccato , v 11staccatissimo11 and tenuto are set at a predetermined distance from the heads or the vertical line tops of respective notes cf. A5 in the part C of FIG. 1 . Other symbols such as f forte , ff fortissimo , p piano , pp panissimo , mf mezzo forte and mp mezzo forte are set at a predetermined distance from the heads or the vertical line tops of respective notes, similarly as in the case of the above described symbol however, if the position is in the record, then the position should be at a predetermined distance from the fifth or first line. Symbols which should be set for a plurality of notes, such as crescendo , decrescendo and octave are set at a predetermined distance from the heads or the vertical line tops of the notes in the range however, if the position is in the record, then the position should be at a predetermined distance from the fifth or first line. The layout is made in such a manner that the character pattern is extended from the left edge of the top note in the range to the right edge of the last note.In the case where the layout is over a plurality of stages, it is divided into two parts in such a manner that the first part is extended from the top note in the range to the record end, and the second part is extended from a start point at a predetermined distance from the same record start point in the next stage to the last note in the range, as indicated by A5 in the parts A and B of FIG. 1. In the case of tremolo , the note or notes are performed quickly and repeatedly. Tremolo includes one or two sounds. If tremolo is treated as normal notes, its resultant set becomes not matchable to time signature so that tremolo consisting of one sound is adjusted to the note to be actually outputted when inputted. The position of the note to be set next is determined according to the note used for calculating the length. Tremolo consisting of two sounds is set by obtaining the angle between two notes in a manner similar to that of serial notes aforementioned, and then connecting the tops of the vertical lines of the notes to draw a lateral line, besides putting other lines shorter than the lateral line by a predetermined length at the center of the notes.Furthermore, where all notes are treated as tremolo , three declined lines are set between the notes and the length of the lateral lines is determined by the value of the constant file. The text is set to the positions corresponding to respective notes and printed out. An initial set data picture consists of a common information picture and a record information picture for specified records, and the contents are retyped as the data are inputted successively according to the cursor. Where an input item is omitted, the cursor is advanced to the next item by depressing a predetermined key. Initially set items are inputted when input requests are indicated on the picture.The music data input device 1 inputs data according to the following procedure Item Input Method 1 Music start Predetermined key 2 Job name Eight English numbers or less, top character 3 Film size 4 Start point x Point value of three digits or less 5 Stage length Point value of three digits or less 6 Music top indent Point value of three digits or less 7 Layout of page 1 a Start point y Point value of three digits or less b Number of stages Value of 30 or less c Stage space Point value of three digits or less 8 Layout of ordinary pages a Start point Y Point value of three digits or less b Number of stages Value of 30 or less c Stage space Point value of three digits or less 9 Music end adjustment dataPoint value of three digits or less 10 Minimum bar length Point value of three digits or less 11 Shortened note space Point value of three digits or less 12 Speed symbol Note duration, and value of three digits or less 13 Number of records Value of 30 or less 14 Score Start record number, and end record number 15 Large staff Start record number, and end record number 16 Record width 1 5 code section 17 Tone symbol Key operation 18 Beat symbol Key operation 19 Key signature Key operation 20 Record space Point value of three digits or less 21 Symbol point 1 3 code selection 22 Data input mode 1 and 2 code selection The data inputted according to the above described procedure are processed by the data processing device 2. A process code PC outputted by the data processing device 2 is stored in the floppy disk 3, and is then stored in the magnetic tape 5 after being edited by the editing device 4. When the data in the magnetic tape 5 is inputted to the photo composing machine 7, a printing pattern stored in the font memory 6 is read out according to the data thus inputted, and a block copy 8 is formed using the printing pattern. Note patterns as the printing patterns are, for instance, as shown in the parts A through F of FIG. 16. By using these patterns notes are formed. As shown in FIG. 17, the sheet music printing system comprises an operating panel 10 having a forwardly inclined surface a music data input device 11 1 a display device CRT 12 and a memory control circuit 13 . The music data input device is a desk type one in which operating keys 100 are operated to apply various music symbols and printing instructions to the data processing device 2. The display device 12 performs a display operation according to a predetermined program for introducing initial set data inputs and music data inputs. The memory control circuit 13 stores music data from the music data input device 11 and causes the display device 12 to display the data in its message area. The memory control circuit 13 further operates to display the data at a predetermined position after confirming it, and to transfer the data to the floppy disk 3.Thus, the sheet music printing system follows instructions from the display device 12, and inputs printing music data successively while confirming the instruction, to for printing music codes. The kinds of operating keys 100 and the arrangement thereof are as shown in FIG. 18. The arrangement of the system is as shown in FIG. 19. The output of the music data 11 is applied to the data processing device 2. The data processing device 2 in cooperation with memory 13 and a memory control circuit 14 causes the display device 12 to perform necessary guide display and input display. According to the inputted data, data are outputted to the floppy disk 3 and a sheet tape 5A. The editing device 4 is illustrated in FIG. 3 in detail. Referring to data processing for note layout and for distributing a blank region at the end of a record over bars, music data inputting will be described. The music data inputting operation is divided into an initial setting operation and a data inputting operation. The flow chart of the initial setting operation is as shown in FIG. 20.

operating the keys is displayed in the message area 122 on the screen, and is then moved to a predetermined display position on the screen by operating the key K63 after being confirmed that it is correct. That is, data inputted from the music data inputting device 1 is applied to the memory control circuit 14, so as to confirm whether it is correct or not. The correct data is inputted into the floppy disk 3 and is moved to a predetermined display position on the screen. The area 123 is used to display the messages of sequence errors or key input errors. FIG. 23 shows another example of the operating panel in FIG. 17. The operating panel has scale keys K1 through R14 generally indicated at 110 and octave selection keys K21 through K23 generally indicated at 120 . The octave selection keys K21, K22 and K23 are respectively for low scale, home position and high scale. Therefore, with one scale key 110 a wide scale can be obtained.The kind of a selected octave selection key 120 is displayed on the display device 12. In FIG. 23, the keys K3 A through K9 G provide one octave scale, the keys K1 F and K2 G provide a scale lower by one octave, and the keys K10 A throughK14 E provide a scale higher by one octave. In the above described arrangement, music data are successively inputted by operation of the operating keys 100 of the music data inputting device, while note data are inputted by operation of the scale keys 110 and the octave selection keys 120 shown in FIG. 23 and note keys not shown . In inputting the note data, the staff 121 is displayed on the screen of the display device 12, and a key signature separately specified by key operation is also displayed on the screen, as shown in FIG. 24. An octave display region 123 is provided at the left end of a region adapted to display these note data, so as to display a selected one of the octave selection keys 120 . When the key K22 for specifying an ordinary octave range I in FIG. 25 is selected a mark H is displayed in the octave display region 123.When the key K21 for specifying a lower octave range II in FIG. 25 is selected, a mark is displayed. When the key K23 for specifying a higher octave range III in FIG. 25 is selected, a mark is displayed. Thus, the kind of an octave selection key 120 selected can be detected immediately by referring to the mark H , or displayed in the octave display region 123. On the other hand, the scale keys 110 can provide a wide range of interval with the aid of selection of one of the octave selection keys 120 . For instance, when the key K22 HOME is selected, the intervals F to E at the HOME position as indicated by I in FIG.25 can be inputted. When the key K21 is selected, the intervals C , D and E lower by one octave than those corresponding to the keys K5, K6 and K7 at the HOME position can be inputted, as indicated by II inFIG. 25. When the key K23 is selected, the intervals F through 9 higher by one octave than those corresponding to the keys K8 through Kll at the HOME position can be inputted. Thus, according to the invention, intervals corresponding to three octaves as indicated at RS in FIG. 25 can be inputted by combining the scale keys 110 corresponding to two octaves and three different octave selection keys 120 , which contributes to reduce the number of keys. Furthermore, since a selected one of the octave selection keys K21,K22 and K23 120 is displayed on the display device 12, the music data can be correctly inputted at all times.
