## Description
The present invention relates to compounds having use in agriculture. There are many publications disclosing triazole and imidazole derivatives as fungicides and plant growth regulators. Relatively few however disclose compounds in which a substituted thio group is attached to the carbon carrying the azole group. Publications describing compounds of this type include G.B. Patent 1419734, EP 752, EP 89703, Japanese Kokai 57150675, 57149279 and 55124769. The present invention relates to a novel group of azole derivatives of this type having valuable biological activity. Thus according to the invention there is provided a compound of formula IEMI1.1 where i Az is l imidazolyl or 1 1,2,4 triazolyl ii R1 and R5 are aryl, cycloalkyl or optionally substituted alkyl iii R4is hydrogen, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, optionally substituted alkyl, aryl, optionally substituted alkanoyl, optionally substituted benzoyl, alkoxycarbonyl or optionally substituted carbamoyl iv n is 0,1 or 2 v a R2 is hydrogen, optionally substituted alkyl. cycloalkyl or alkenyl and R is hydrogen or optionally substituted alkyl, or b R2 and R3 form a double bond vi when R2 is optionally substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl or alkenyl and Az is l 1,2,4 triazolyl , R3 and R4 can also form a double bond together with acid addition salts, complexes of these compounds with metal salts, with the provisos a at least one of R2, R3 and R4 is not hydrogen, b when R1 is aryl and R2 and R3 are hydrogen, R4 is not alkoxymethyl, c when R1is aryl or aralkyl, R2 and R3 are hydrogen and R5 is unsubstituted alkyl, R4 is not alkanoyl, and d when R2 is substituted benzyl and R3 and R4 form a double bond, 5 is not tertiary butyl. The complexes are usually with a salt of formula in which M is a divalent metal cation, e.g. copper, calcium, cobalt, nickel or preferably manganese, and A is an anion, e.g. chloride, nitrate or a hydrocarbon sulphonate e.g. dodecylbenzenesulphonate. The molar ratio of the compound to metal salt is usually 2 or 4 to 1.Acid addition salts are usually formed with strong inorganic or organic acids e.g. hydrochloric acid or oxalic acid. Generally however the compounds are used as the free base. Aryl groups are usually optionally substituted phenyl but may also include other aromatic groups such as naphthyl and heterocyclic aromatic groups which may be substituted, such as pyridyl, pyrimidyl, triazolyl, imidazolyl, thienyl and furanyl. When the aryl is substituted, the substituents may include halogen, hydroxy alkyl, alkoxy, cyano, nitro, aryl, or aryloxy. Preferred substituents are halogen, especially chlorine. Any alkyl and alkoxy groups are generally of 1 to 8, e.g. 1 to 4, carbon atoms and may be substituted e.g. by halogen, especially fluorine or chlorine, alkoxy. alkoxycarbonyl, 1,3 dioxolan 2 yl, alkanoyloxy or aryl. Alkenyl groups are generally of 2 to 4 carbon atoms. Cycloalkyl groups are usually of 3 to 7 carbon atoms. Az is preferably 1 1,2,4 triazolyl and n is preferably 0. Of the other groups, R1 is preferablyC3 5 alkyl. especially tertiary butyl. or halophenyl.especially 4 chloro or 2,4 dichlorophenyl Rê, when not forming a double bond, is preferably hydrogen, methyl or ethyl R3, when not forming a double bond, is preferably hydrogen or methyl R4 is preferably alkyl. e.g. C1 4 alkyl, optionally substituted by phenoxy, halophenyl, 1,3 dioxolan 2 yl, halophenyl. hydroxy, alkoxycarbonyl or alkanoyloxy and R5is preferably alkyl. e.g. C1 4 alkyl. or phenyl, substituted by halogen, e.g. 4 chloro , 2,4 dichloro or 4 bromophenyl , haloalkoxy, e.g.difluoromethoxy, or trifluoromethyl. A particularly preferred group of compounds is that where Az is 1 1,2,4 triazolyl , n is 0, R1is C45 alkyl or halophenyl, Rê and R3 are hydrogen or methyl or together form a double bond, R4 is C1 4 alkyl and R5 is C1 4 alkyl or halophenyl. The compounds of the invention have activity as fungicides. especially against fungal diseases of plants, e.g. mildews, such as powdery mildews and particularly barley powdery mildew ErssiPhe araminis , rice blast PYricularia oryzae , wheat brown rust Puccinia recondita , potato blight Phytophthora infestans and vine downy mildew PlasmoPora viticola . The invention thus also provides a method of combating fungi at a locus infested or liable to be infested therewith, which comprises applying to the locus a compound of formula I. Some of the compounds of the invention are effective in controlling the growth of a wide variety of crops, especially to cause height reduction without any detrimental effect on the health and vigour of the plants. The invention thus also includes a method of controlling plant growth by applying to the plant a growth regulating amount of a compound of formula I. This aspect of the invention is applicable to both mono and dicotyledonous plants, e.g. mung beans, soybeans, barley, wheat, rice. sugarbeet, cotton, sunflowers, pot plants, such as chrysanthemums, turf grass, top fruit e.g.apples , vegetables and woody ornamentals. In some cases,the products can encourage the formation of extra shoots or tillers e.g. on cereals. The invention also provides an agricultural composition comprising a compound of formula I in admixture with an agronomically acceptable diluent or carrier. The composition of the invention may of course include more than one compound of the invention. In addition the composition can comprise one or more additional active ingredients, for example compounds known to possess plant growth regulant, herbicidal, fungicidal, insecticidal or acaricidal properties.

The diluent or carrier in the composition of the invention can be a solid or a liquid optionally in association with a surface active agent, for example a dispersing agent, emulsifying agent or wetting agent.Suitable surface active agents include anionic compounds such as a carboxylate, for example a metal carboxylate of a long chain fatty acid an N acylsarcosinate mono or di esters of phosphoric acid with fatty alcohol ethoxylates or salts of such esters fatty alcohol sulphates such as sodium dodecyl sulphate a sodium octadecyl sulphate or sodium cetyl sulphate ethoxylated fatty alcohol sulphates ethoxylated alkylphenol sulphates lignin sulphonates petroleum sulphonates alkyl aryl sulphonates such as alkyl benzene sulphonates or lower alkylnaphthalene sulphonates. e.g.butyl naphthalene sulphonate salts of sulphonated naphthalene formaldehyde condensates salts of sulphonated phenol formaldehyde condensates or more complex sulphonates such as the amide sulphonates, e.g. the sulphonated condensation product of oleic acid andN methyl taurine or the dialkyl sulphosuccinates, e.g. the sodium sulphonate of dioctyl succinate. Nonionic agents include condensation products of fatty acid esters, fatty alcohols, fatty acid amides or fatty alkyl or alkenyl substituted phenols with ethylene oxide, fatty esters of polyhydric alcohol ethers, e.g. sorbitan fatty acid esters, condensation products of such esters with ethylene oxide, e.g. polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, acetylenic glycols such as 2,4,7,9 tetramethyl 5 decyn 4,7 diol, or ethoxylated acetylenic glycols. Examples of a cationic surface active agent include, for instance, an aliphatic mono , di , or polyamine as an acetate, naphthenate or oleate an oxygen containing amine such as an amine oxide or polyoxyethylene alkylamine an amide linked amide prepared by the condensation of a carboxylic acid with a di or polyamine or a quaternary ammonium salt. The compositions of the invention can take any form known in the art for the formulation of fungicidal, plant growth regulant and similar compounds, for example, a solution, a dispersion, an aqueous emulsion, a dusting powder, a seed dressing, a fumigant, a smoke, a dispersible powder, an emulsifiable concentrate or granules. Moreover it can be in a suitable form for direct application or as a concentrate or primary composition which requires dilution with a suitable quantity of water or other diluent before application. As a dispersion, the composition comprises a compound of the invention dispersed in a liquid medium, preferably water. It is often convenient to supply the consumer with a primary composition which can be diluted with water to form a dispersion having the desired concentration The primary composition can be provided in any one of the following forms. It can be a dispersible solution which comprises a compound of the invention dissolved in a water miscible solvent with the addition of a dispersing agent. A further alternative comprises a compound of the invention in the form of a finely ground powder in association with a dispersing agent and intimately mixed with water to give a paste or cream which can if desired be added to an emulsion of oil in water to give a dispersion of active ingredient in an aqueous oil emulsion. An emulsifiable concentrate comprises a compound of the invention dissolved in a water immiscible solvent which is formed into an emulsion with water in the presence of an emulsifying agent. A dusting powder comprises a compound of the invention intimately mixed and ground with a solid pulverulent diluent, for example, kaolin. A granular solid comprises a compound of the invention associated with similar diluents to those which may be employed in dusting powders, but the mixture is granulated by known methods. Alternatively it comprises the active ingredient adsorbed or absorbed on a pre granular diluent, for example, Fuller s earth, attapulgite or limestone grit. A wettable powder usually comprises the active ingredient in admixture with a suitable surfactant and an inert powder diluent such as china clay. Another suitable concentrate is a flowable suspension concentrate which is formed by grinding the compound with water, a wetting agent and a suspending agent. The concentration of the active ingredient in the composition of the present invention, as applied to plants is preferably within the range of 0.01 to 3.0 per cent by weight, especially 0.01 to 1.0 per cent by weight. In a primary composition the amount of active ingredient can vary widely and can be, for example, from 5 to 95 per cent by weight of the composition. In the method of the invention the compound is generally applied to seeds, plants or their habitat. Thus, the compound can be applied directly to the soil before, at or after drilling so that the presence of active compound in the soil can control the growth of fungi which may attack seeds. When the soil is treated directly the active compound can be applied in any manner which allows it to be intimately mixed with the soil such as by spraying, by broadcasting a solid form of granules, or by applying the active ingredient at the same time as drilling by inserting it in the same drill as the seeds. A suitable applications rate is within the range of from 0.05 to 20 kg per hectare, more preferably from 0.1 to 10 kg per hectare. Alternatively the active compound can be applied directly to the plant by, for example. spraying or dusting either at the time when the fungus has begun to appear on the plant or before the appearance of fungus as as protective measure. In both such cases the preferred mode of application is by foliar spraying. It is generally important to obtain good control of fungi in the early stages of plant growth as this is the time when the plant can be most severely damaged. For cereal crops such as wheat, barley and oats it is often desirable to spray the plant at cr before growth stage 5 although additional treatments by spraying when the plant is more mature can augment resistance to the growth or spread of fungi. The spray or dust can conveniently contain a pre or post emergence herbicide if this is thought necessary.Sometimes, it is practicable to treat the roots of a plant before or during planting, for example, by dipping the roots in a suitable liquid or solid composition. When the active compound is applied directly to the plant a suitable rate of application is from 0.01 to 10 kg. per hectare, preferably from 0.05 to 5 kg per hectare. When the compounds of the invention are used as growth regulators they are usually best applied during the vegetative stages of growth at similar rates as above. In the case of crops such as legumes, cotton and sunflowers, application preferably takes place during the late vegetative stage of growth, or just prior to or just after the onset of flowering. In the case of cereals, pot plants and turf, earlier application. during the early vegetative stage of growth. is more appropriate. The compounds of the invention may be prepared in variety of ways as shown by the following reaction sequences. X halogen EMI13.1 Compounds in which n is 1 may be obtained by oxidising compounds of formula I in which n is 0. Compounds in which n is 2 may be obtained by oxidising compounds of formula I in which n is 0 or 1. As oxidising agent there may be used a per acid, e.g. 3 chloroperbenzoic acid. The molar amount of oxidising agent will usually determine the degree of oxidation. Salts can be prepared by reacting the free base with a suitable acid e.g. hydrochloric acid. Complexes can be prepared by reacting the base with a suitable metal salt e.g. manganese II chloride. The invention is illustrated in the followingExamples.
