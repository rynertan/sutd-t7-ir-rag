## Description
OPEN MIXER FOR THE PROCESSING OF RUBBER AND PLASTICS,PROVIDED WITH AN ADDITIONAL ROLL The present invention deals with an open type mixer for rubber and plastics processing, which is provided with an additional roll. It is known that open mills or mixers are essential in the processing of rubber and plastic material to obtain mixes with the desired compound and degree of homogeneity and temperature. They may be used either as a first stage of processing, as they receive the mix components directly from a hopper, or as second stage downstream of a closed Banbury type mixer, in which case they have also a cooling function. Inside thereof in fact a cooling fluid flows, usually water. It is however known that these prior art mixers require a number of subsequent passages of the same compound batch, before the latter can be considered ready to be used in a rubber moulding press. Furthermore, if the compound batch has already passed upstream through a closed mixer, in any case a multiplicity of passes will be necessary to reduce the mix temperature. In order to reduce the working time, it would be possible to cause the same compound batch to pass subsequently through at least a second open mixer, operating in series with the first one, but the costs and dimensions involved would be excessive, thus seriously affecting the overall economy of the process. It has now been conceived, and forms the object of the present invention, an improved open mixer which comprises a third additional roll, substantially positioned under the other two, therefore such as to increase the overall dimensions of the mixer in height direction only. With such an additional cylinder the compound processing and the desired temperature are obtained in a substantially shorter time, thus with a considerable increase of the production per hour in comparison with the conventional two roll mixers. The improved mixer according to the present invention comprises two internally cooled rolls which are rotatable about two horizontal and parallel axes, at least one of which can be adjusted as to the distance thereof from the axis of the other roll, possibly mutually engaging along a pair of cylinder generating lines, and is characterized by comprising a third additional roll also having a horizontal rotation axis, parallel and positioned at a lower height than the other two rolls, this roll also being internally cooled and provided with approachment means and adjusting means for a fine adjustment of the distance from one of said upper rolls, possibly engaging with the latter along a pair of generating lines, the three rolls being all independently motor driven, whereby each pair of mutually engaged rolls show an opposite direction of rotation and the roll having the lowest peripheral speed is one of the two upper rolls. According to a particular aspect of the present invention the axes of the two upper rolls are positioned on a plane inclined to the horizontal and the one mounted at a lower level of the two can come into contact with the third additional roll. Furthermore, in a cross section view, the angle between the lines joining the centre of the roll engageable with the other two and the centre of the other two rolls, is comprised between 600 and 1200 and preferably from 800 to 900. Again preferably said intermediate roll will be the one on which the mix sheet is formed and therefore the roll provided with the lowest peripheral speed. Eurther features and advantages of the present invention will be clear to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of an embodiment thereof, given by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein FIGURE 1 is a side end view of the improved mixer according to the invention FIGURE 2 is a diagrammatic cross sectional view taken in an intermediate position along the three rolls and FIGURE 3 is a partial cross sectional view along the line III III of Fig. 1. With reference to the drawings, the improved mixer according to the present invention comprises, in addition to the two upper rolls 1 and 2 being mutually parallel and mounted with horizontal axes, a third roll 3 mounted at a lower height than the other two.Preferably, according to the invention, the rolls 1 and 2 are positioned at different heights, but the plane comprising their axes is inclined to the horizontal by an angle a having preferably a value between 7 and 100, as is better seen in Fig. 2, which shows the geometry of their placement, in such a way that the roll 2 is mounted at a higher level than the roll 1. The latter, as it is known, has quick approachment means in relationship with the fixedly mounted roll 2 and e.g. formed as a cylinder and piston 4, as well as adjusting means for a fine adjustment of the distance, such as of the screw type, not shown in the drawing. The third additional roll 3 is mounted under the other two, this also on quick approachment means as cylinder and piston 5, being similar to the means 4 of roll 1. The adjustment of the distance between roll 3 and roll 1, until possibly coming into contact along a generating line of each roll, is again controlled by a fine adjustment device, such as of the screw type, also not shown like for adjusting the distance between rolls 1 and 2. In this way the three rolls may be mutually engaged in pairs and in the shown embodiment the intermediate roll 1 engages the other two rolls. With reference to Fig. 2, if the cross section centres of the three rolls are joined together, a triangle is obtained wherein the angle ss corresponding to the centre of roll 1 is, according to the invention, in the range between 600 and 1200 and preferably between 800 and 900. These values of angle ss correspond to a more advanta geous positioning of the roll 3 to accomplish the mixer action both for a better homogenization of the mix components and for a quick cooling when the material to be processed is fed from a first closed mixer, where its temperature has increased. All the three rolls are in fact run across, in a known manner, by the flow of a cooling fluid, such as water, through pipe fittings 7 CFig. 3 . As shown in Fig. 1, the intermediate roll 1 is that on which the mix sheet M is formed, whose thickness will be a function of the nip distance existing between this roll and the other two and adjustable, as previously described, by means of screw devices associated with the quick advancement means 4 and 5. Two scrapers 6, 6a are provided on the other two rolls and mounted slight ly downstream of the zone of contact with the intermediate roll 1, when considering the rotation directions as indicated on the drawing. It should be appreciated that at the nip or contact point between two rolls, the movement of their periphery will be in the same direction, whereby the rotations of two mutually co operating rolls are of opposite direction, whereas are the same for the rolls 2 and 3 which are spaced apart. As the compound to be processed is fed from the top to the nip zone between rolls 1 and 2, it is obvious that these will have the directions of rotation shown in the drawing, namely counterclockwise for the roll 1 and clockwise for the roll 2, so that the compound then passes through the nip zone between the intermediate roll 1 and the additional roll 3, this latter having again a clockwise direction of rotation. As to the speed, the roll on which the sheet of mix is being formed the intermediate roll 1 in this case will have the lowest peripheral speed, whereas the other two will have slightly higher peripheral speeds to give the compound a certain amount of rub. This amount shall be greater for the first roll which comes into contact with the sheet of compound and smaller for the other roll, that is the additional roll 3. Therefore this latter will have preferably a peripheral speed comprised between the slowest one of roll 1 of the order of 15 rpm and the faster speed of roll 2. Should the rolls have all the same diameter, one can make mention of rotational speed instead of peripheral speed. It is obvious that if the device is in a completely retreated position, so as to allow no possibility for the compound to be processed in the nip between the rolls 1 and 3, the mixer would operate again conventionally with two rolls. With reference to Fig. 3, the mounting details, although diagrammatic of the two rolls 1 and 3 are shown. The first one can slide with a reciprocating horizontal motion, being thrusted by the cylinder piston 4, here not shown, along guides 8 and integrally with the pipe fitting 7 for feeding the coolant fluid. The additional roll 3 can instead slide vertically or in an inclined direction having a substantial vertical component, being also integral with the associate fitting 7, along the guide 9, as urged by the thrust of the cylinder piston 5, not shown here, but fixed to the sliding block 9a. Possible additions and or modifications can be performed by those skilled in the art to the described and illustrated embodiment of the improved mixer according to the present invention without departing from the scope of the inventon itself.
