# Method and apparatus for measuring chromatic dispersion coefficient.

## Abstract
A measuring system operated by an optical transmitter 91 an optical spectrum analyzing part 93 receiving an input optical signal branched from the optical transmitter an optical receiver 92 for connecting with, via an optical fiber to be measured, the optical transmitter and a data proces sing part 94 operative to produce a chromatic dispersion coefficient to be measured, by comparing a calculated baseband characteristic, derived from data concerning the optical transmitter 91 and the optical spectrum analyzing part 93 , with an actual baseband characteristic obtained in the optical receiver.
