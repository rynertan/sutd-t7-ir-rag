# Craze resistant transparent resinous copolymers.

## Abstract
Resinous polymodal block copolymers of such as buta diene and styrene which are craze resistant, transparent, and substantially colour free, and methods of producing the block copolymers. The copolymers are prepared by sequential charge copolymerization modes comprising the solution polymerization of at least two charges each of a conjugated diene, a monovinylarene, and a monoalkali metal initiator, at least one charge of conjugated diene monomer precedes the last charge of monoalkali metal initiator, at least one charge each of monovinylarene and of conjugated diene follows the last charge of monoalkali metal initiator, and the final charge of monomer is a charge of conjugated diene monomer, such that the number of charges of each of said components is not more than three, and the total of the charges of the three components is 8 or 9.
