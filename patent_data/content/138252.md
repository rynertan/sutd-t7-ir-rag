## Abstract
A liquid, homogeneous mixture for use in the LSC Liquid Scintillation Counting analysis technique, comprising a scintil lation liquid, a scintillator and a surfactant, which mixture in cludes one or more phosphoric acid esters having formula 1 and or formula 2 of the sheet of formulae, in which R , R and R represent an organic group, which phosphor acid esters are neutralized to a pH, at which the neutralization product comprises a mono and or diphosphate with an alkaline mate rial having a pK
