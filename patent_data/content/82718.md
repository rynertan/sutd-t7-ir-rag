# Ink jet printing head.

## Abstract
The printing head 12 comprises an insulating container 14 for conductive ink 16 which is expelled through a fine nozzle 18 when a voltage pulse is applied between an electrode 56, 57, 40 and a counter electrode 22 . Capillary passages 51, 50 lead to the nozzle 18 to allow formation of an ink meniscus 23 right up until exhaustion of the ink. A vent 69 keeps the pressure inside the container constant. The head 12 is snap fitted onto a carriage with a conductive plate abutted by the counter electrode 20 and a spring contacting the external part 40 of the electrode. This plate and spring are fed by way of conductive elements sliding along conductive carriage guides.
