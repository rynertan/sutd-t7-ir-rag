## Description
Device for successive display of different images. The invention relates to a device for the successive display of different images, for example, in the form of pictures, texts and the like, comprising a frame and image members adapted to turn about axes of rotation and journalled in said frame, said image members having a plurality of image faces at an angle to one another and being adjustable in the frame in a manner such that each time a plurality of image faces of adjacent image members display the desired image, each image member comprising a plurality of lamellae extending at least substantially parallel to the axes of rotation and being provided on both sides with an image face, said lamellae being arranged in the image member so as to be rotatable through 1800 about their longitudinal axes and being supported by supporting members forming part of the image member and being rotatable about the axis of rotation of the image member, there being provided setting means with the aid of which each lamella is turned about its longitudinal axis during the turn of the image member concerned. From British Patent Specification 1,551,230 such a device is known in which the lamellae are turned about their longitudinal axes occupying a fixed position in the image member. In order to allow a turn of a given 0 lamella through 180 neighbouring lamellae have to be turned to and fro, which involves a comparatively complicated driving mechanism for the lamellae. Apart therefrom it will not be possible in practice to use lamellae of such a width that the lamellae of neighbouring image members coming into view adjoin one another at least substantially, since with such a broad design of the lamellae the lamellae of a given image member can practically not be turned one along the other. In order to obviate this inconvenience French Patent Specification 433,182 proposes a construction of a similar device in which each lamella is subdivided into two parts which are relatively slidable in the direction of width of the lamella. This brings about a still more complicated mechanism for turning the lamellae and for setting the parts of the lamellae relatively to one another.Due to the complication of the known constructions they are not only expensive, but also highly susceptible of wear so that maintenance is also expensive. According to the invention the lamellae are capable of reciprocating with respect to the supporting members in a direction away from the axis of rotation and in a direction towards the axis of rotation, whilst guide means are provided with the aid of which each lamella as a unit is guided between two consecutive positions in which it is located on the front side of the device, gradually in a direction away from the axis of rotation and subsequently in a direction toward the axis of rotation, whilst the lamellae and the frame of the device are provided with relatively co ope rating cams and or stops causing a turn of the lamella concerned about its longitudinal axis during the reciprocatory movement of the lamella with respect to the axis of rotation. By using the construction embodying the invention a simple design of the device can be obtained in which the means for displacing and turning the lamellae can be constructed in a simple manner and the lamellae, without the need for composing them from several parts, can have such a width that the lamellae forming a picture or the like getting into view in neighbouring image members adjoin one another at least substantially. The invention will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying Figures which schematically show an embodiment of the construction in accordance with the invention. Fig. 1 is a front view of part of a device embodying the invention. Fig. 2 is a plan view of an image member comprising three lamellae. Fig. 3 is an elevational view of a catching member for the lamellae. Fig. 4 is an elevational view of a guide curve for the lamellae in which the turn of a lamella about its longitudinal axis is represented in different positions. Referring to Fig. 1, the device embodying the invention comprises a frame 1 in the form of a framework accommodating a plurality of image mem bers 3 adapted to turn about vertical, relatively parallel axes of rotation 2. Although in the embodiment shown the image members 3 can turn about vertical axes of rotation 2, it will be obvious that the axes of rotation may be arranged, as an alternative, at a different angle, for example, in horizontal positions. The shafts 4 of the image members arranged coaxially with the axes 2 can be simultaneously turned with the aid of a driving motor 5 and a transmission mechanism 6. In the embodiment shown an image member of the kind schematically shown in Fig. 2 comprises three lamellae 7, 8 and 9, which are provided at their ends with stub shafts 10, which are coaxial with the longitudinal axes of the lamellae extending parallel to the axes of rotation 2 so that the lamellae are capable of turning about their longitudinal axes in the image member 3 concerned. The stub shafts 10 fastened to the lower and top ends of the lamellae 7 to 9 are arranged in slots 11 in plate shaped catches 12 fastened near the top and bottom ends of the lamellae to the shaft 4. From Fig. 3 it will be apparent that the slots relatively off set through an angle of 1200 about the centre line 2 of the shaft 4 extend in a radial direction with respect to the centre line 2 of the shaft 4.Therefore, the stub shafts 10 are capable of sliding to and fro in the slots 11 with respect to the shaft 4. At least near one end of each display member 3 a guide curve 13 is stationarily arranged for the stub shafts 10 located at the end concerned, the arrangement being such that the stub shafts 10 concerned will move through the curve during the turn of the image member 3 concerned. Referring to Fig. 4 the lamella 7 extends parallel to the front side of the device. From this Figure it will furthermore be apparent that the curve or groove 13, in which the ends of the pins 10 are moving during operation, is concentric by its part 14 directed towards the front side of the device with the shaft 4 through an angle of about 2100. The ends of the part 14 of the curve 13 concentric with the rotary shaft 4 are adjoined by parts 15 and 16 being at least substantially at right angles to the front side of the device, which parts communicate with one another through a curved part 17 of the groove.Near said curved part 17 of the groove four stops 18 are fixed in the device so that these stops 18 are arranged symmetrically to a plane at right angels to the front side of the device and going through the axis of rotation 2 of the image member 3 concerned. Each la mella is provided at the end concerned with a cam 19 co operating with the fixed stops 18 concerned. From Figs. 2 and 4 it will be apparent that when an image member is turned with the aid of the driving motor 5 through 1200, the lamella 7 will get into the position 7 shown in Fig. 4, whereas the lamella 9 gets at the front side of the device. Upon a further turn of the image member the stub shafts 10 fastened to the lamella 7 are compelled to move through the groove 13, whilst the stub shafts concerned are displaced in the slots 11. The cam 19 fastened to the lamella 7 will co operate with the stops 18 so that , as is shown in Fig. 4, the lamella 7 is gradually turned through an angle of 1200 about its longitudinal axis into the position 7 . When the lamella has attained the postion 7 , this lamella will again lie at the front of the device after a next turn of the image member 3 through an angle of 1200. Owing to the turn descirbed of the lamella 7 about its longitudinal axis the image face A first visible is replaced by the image face B at the front of the device. During operation, when the image members 3 are turning, all lamellae are turned about their longitudinal axes and in the embodiment shown in total six different image faces will be consecutively displaced on the front side of the device. By using the turning mechanism descirbed above in which the lamellae are not only turned about their longitudinal axes but also shifted with respect to a central shaft 4 of the image member, it remains possible to maintain a compactconstructionof the device, whilst the image surfaces visible at the front in neighbouring lamellae at least substantially join one another by their longitudinal edges. As a matter of course, many variations and or supplements are possible within the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the lamellae may have a different shape than the rhombic form shown in theFigures, whey may be rectangular or elliptical. The drive of the lamellae may be constructed in any desired manner. In the drive shown all image members are turning in the same direction, but as an alternative a drive is conceivable in which adjacent image members turn in opposite senses.It will be obvious that also in these cases the construction embodying the invention can be used by correctly arranging the various image faces on the various lamellae. The figures used in the claims are only meant to explain more clearly the intention of the invention and are not supposed to be any restriction concerning the interpretation of the invention.
