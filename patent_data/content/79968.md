# METHOD FOR TREATING A WASTE GAS FROM CHLORINATION FURNACE.

## Abstract
A waste gas containing COâ‚‚ as a major component and harmful substances such as chlorides, discharged from a chlorination furnace for producing titanium tetrachloride or zirconium tetrachloride, is washed with water, for example, in a water washing tower, and water is removed from the washed waste gas till its dew point becomes 5 C or lower, followed by adsorption treatment of the gas in an active carbon tower. Thus, the concentration of chlorides in the waste gas can be reduced as low as 5 ppm or lower in terms of HCI .
