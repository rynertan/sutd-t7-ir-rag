# Isomerization of xylene.

## Abstract
In a process for isomerization xylenes which comprises contacting an aromatic hydrocarbon stock mainly containing xylene isomers not attaining a thermodynamic equilibrium composition with a catalyst composition containing a crystal line aluminosilicate at an elevated temperature in the vapor phase in the presence of hydrogen, the improvement wherein said catalyst composition comprises a crystalline aluminosili cate having a silica alumina mole ratio of at least 10 and contains at least two metals which are a platinum and b at least one metal selected from the group consisting of titanium, chromium, zinc, gallium, germanium, strontium, yttrium, zirconium, molybdenum, palladium, tin, barium, cesium, cerium, tungsten, osmium, lead, cadmium, mercury, indium, lanthanum, beryllium, lithium and rubidium.
