# Manufacture of imidazolines.

## Abstract
The reaction between a fatty acid RCOOH and a diamine H₂NCH₂CH₂NHR₁ wherein R represents an aliphatic group comprising from 8 to 22 carbon atoms and R₁ represents a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl or alkenyl group comprising from 1 to 4 carbon atoms so as to produce an imidazoline is carried out using a moderate initial excess of diamine and when necessary reducing the pressure logarithmically with respect to time until the reaction is completed. The formation of undesirable diamide impurities is avoided while using economic quantities of diamine and non specialised equipment. The processes can be carried out without any monitoring of the progress of the reaction by skilled personnel being required and if through error progress is unsatisfactory a single readjustment can serve to carry the reaction to completion.

## Description
This invention relates to novel methods and apparatus for carrying out and controlling the condensation reaction between a fatty acid and an ethylene diamine to produce an imidazo7ine compound. The imidazolines in question are those having the general formula EMI1.1 wherein R represents an aliphatic group which comprises from 8 to 22 carbon atoms per molecule and R1 represents a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl or alkenyl group comprising from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The preparation of such compounds by the condensation of a fatty acid RCOOH with a diamine H2NCH2CH2NHR1 has been described in UnitedStates Patent 2,267,965. The reaction proceeds substantially according to the equation RCOOH H2NCH2CH2NHR1EMI1.2 RCONHCH2CH2NHR1 H20EMI1.3 A problem in carrying out this reaction is that the diamine is relatively volatile under the conditions used and tends to distil out of the reaction system with the water of reaction which is necessarily removed from the system. This is a particular problem since as the proportion of amine present drops the intermediate amido amine increasingly tends to react with a further molecule of acid to form a diamide.Where the imidazoline product is subsequently converted into a derivative which is useful as a surface active agent such as those described inUnited States Patents 2,528,378, 2,773,068 and 3,738,996 and incorporated into an aqueous composition the diamide impurity separates from the solution as a white, cloudy material which detracts from the ideal sparkling clear nature of the product. In British Patent 1,187,131 it is suggested that in order to minimise the formation of diamide the reaction should be carried substantially to completion in the presence of at least an 8 molar excess of the diamine. This is achieved by the repeated addition of small quantities of amine to the reactor. A variety of techniques can be adopted in order to maintain the excess of diamine. The reaction can be carried out using a very large initial excess of diamine so that the required excess quantities are present even at the end of the reaction provision can be made to supply fresh diamine to the reaction vessel as the reaction proceeds or an extremely efficient fractionating system can be fitted so as to prevent the escape of any significant quantity of diamine. In a commercial scale manufacturing operation the first method is unattractive for economic reasons whilst the second and third require that the progress of the reaction be monitored extremely carefully.During the reaction the pressure must be reduced in order to remove the water of reaction. If this is done too quickly the boil up rate of the liquid increases in an uncontrollable manner and if it is done too slowly distilliation ceases and the reaction time is extended. Such techniques pose problems of plant control. We have now discovered a method for controlling the reaction between a fatty acid and a diamine so as to produce a product having a low content of diamide which requires only a moderate initial excess of diamine and avoids the necessity of replenishing the diamine during the course of the reaction. Our invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound having the formula EMI2.1 wherein R and R1 are as hereinbefore defined which comprises heating a fatty acid RCOOH in the presence of an excess of a diamine H2NCH2CH2NR until at least 1.8 moles of water per mole of acid have been evolved, the pressure being reduced as necessary from its initial value to a final value in the range 5 to 50 mm of mercury in a substantially logarithmic manner with respect to time. Surprisingly this pattern of the variation of pressure with time controls the vapour temperature so as to minimise excessive boil up and hence loss of diamine whilst maintaining a steady reaction rate.The initial excess of diamine required to ensure than an excess is present throughout the reaction can be reduced from the very high levels required in previous processes which were not be monitored to a level of from 12 to 30 expressed as moles of diamine to moles of acid without producing a product comprising too high a proportion of di amine. Furthermore the reaction can be carried out by unskilled personnel or more preferably by employing automatic equipment programmed to reduce the pressure in a logarithmic manner. The reaction is carried out at a temperature of greater than 150VC but less than boiling point of the amine under the conditions employed.Preferably the temperature in the pot is maintained in the range 1700 to 2200C, most preferably 1800 to 200 C. The novel procedures are conveniently carried out by charging approximate quantities of acid and diamine to a closed vessel equipped with external or internal heating means a fractionating condenser and a source of vacuum. The temperature of the reactants is raised to the desired level sufficiently slowly so as to minimise frothing. During or after but preferably before this operation the vessel is evacuated so as to reduce the pressure to a preselected initial level which ensures adequate evaporation of water so that the reaction proceeds at a satisfactory rate whilst minimising the evaporation of amine.A suitable level can be ascertained by experiment using a particular reaction system but we have found the following correlation to represent convenient temperature pressure setting EMI4.1 tb Temperature SEP C SEP Pressure SEP mn SEP Hg tb SEP 200 SEP 200 SEP mm tb SEP 175 SEP 150 SEP mm tb SEP 150 SEP 100 SEP mm tb The reaction will commence at higher pressures but will not proceed toward completion with any great rapidity. However if the indicated temperatures and pressures are employed and maintained up to 50 of the reaction may take place without any further reduction in pressure being required. When the reaction slows which is indicated by a rise in vapour temperature, the pressure is reduced logarithmically with respect to time.The time necessary to complete the reaction to the required degree is also determined by experiment.In general, when operating in our preferred temperature ranges, total reaction times of from 12 to 24 hours may be required, the pressure being reduced over a period of from 6 to 18 hours of that time. For a reaction carried out using a particular fractionating system the pressure at any given time t can be calculated from the equation LogxP LogPo LoglO .A.t where P0 is the pressure when time t is 0, x is the base upon which the logarithm is expressed and A represents a constant. When the pressure P is expressed as millimetres of mercury absolute and the time t in hours we have found that values of A from 0.03 to 0.4 lead to the formation of products containing acceptably low quantities of diamide in acceptable short periods of time. Preferably A takes a value of from 0.06 to 0.25. We have found that variations in either logxP or of the constant A of 10 from the ideal value for a particular system can be tolerated without leading to undesirably high rates of boil up or prolonging the reaction unduly. In practice some deviation of logxP is enevitable whilst the tolerence allowed in selecting a value of A is useful in avoiding tedious evaluation of the ideal value. Where the rate of boil up during the reaction becomes too high or too slow thereby prolonging the reaction the rate of pressure reduction may be adjusted accordingly. Thus in effect in such a circumstance the rate of reduction is recalculated on the basis of a fresh set of P0 and to values corresponding to the point reached during the reaction. Such techniques are less preferred since they require that the progress of the reaction should be monitored.Normally in a particular system no more than two and certainly no more than five such adjustments should be necessary. In fact it may well be preferable to allow the rate of boil to exceed the optimum for a short time since any deficiencies in the product of that particular reaction can be remedied by blending it with the product of other more successful reactions, rather than to monitor the progress of the reaction and the pressure on frequent occasions. The preferred fatty acids for use in the processes of our invention are those in which R represents an alkyl, alkenyl or cycloalkyl group comprising from 8 to 22 carbon atoms. Conveniently such acids are obtained from natural sources and comprise mixtures of acids in which the nature of the group R varies. Suitable acids include caproic, heptylic, capryllic, undecylic, lauric, palmitic, stearic, isosteari c,ethylhexanonic , behenic, arachic, cerotic, oleic, erucic, linoleic, linolenic and ricinoleic acids. Natural mixtures useful include the so called coconut acids, palm oil acids and tallow acids. Preferably such acids comprise an average of, from 10 to 18 most preferably 12 to 14 carbon atoms per molecule. The diamine reactants preferred for present use are those whereinR1 represents a alkyl, hydroxy alkyl or amino alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Preferably R1 represents a hydroxy alkyl group having from 2 to 4 carbon atoms. Most preferably R1 represents a hydroxy ethyl group CH2CH2CH. Thus the most preferred diamine from which the imidazoline is derived is N 2 aminoethyl ethanolamine. The invention is illustrated by following example EXAMPLE I A stirred jacketed reactor was charged with 68 kg lauric acid and 46.1 kg ami noethyl ethanol amine.
