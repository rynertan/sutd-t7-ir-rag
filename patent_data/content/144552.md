## Description
DISC BRAKE CORROSION BARRIER This invention relates to a disc brake corrosion barrier for a land located within the bore of the housing containing the disc brake piston. Disc brake assemblies include a piston located within a bore of the housingr the piston being inserted within the bore and movable relative to the housing in order to engage the brake shoe pads with the disc of the brake assembly. With the emphasis upon lighter components for automotive vehicles in order to increase mileage and performance, pistons for disc brake assemblies have been manufactured of phenolic materials which produce lightweight, reliable and effective pistons. The phenolic pistons are inexpensive, lighter, and insulate the brake fluid from heat generated during brake operation, the heat generated creating a sufficiently high temperature to boil the brake fluid and thereby create air bubbles in the fluid, which can lead to brake failure. Phenolic or plastic pistons are widely used in disc brake assemblies. However, the standard dise brake assembly typically includes an interior seal groove located within the mouth or opening of the housing bore, and an exterior boot seal opening located at the bore opening.The interior seal groove and exterior boot seal opening are separated by a land. An interior seal ring is disposed within the interior seal groove and a flexible exterior boot seal has one end received within the exterior boot seal opening, the two seals being separated by the land.The phenolic piston is disposed within the bore, whereby the surface of the piston engages both the interior and exterior seals and the land located therebetween. Although the seals protect the housing bore from contaminant materials, moisture and fluids still enter the bore because elthey the boot seal is improperly installed, is made of a permeable material, or is damaged during operation. It is common for corrosion to develop on the perimeter or surface of the land. This corrosion buildup engages the surface of the piston during operation of the disc brake assembly, and digs into or gouges the piston surface to the extent that it is not uncommon for the piston to experience lockup after braking has ceased.Upon lockup, the piston is held in an extended position which may result in dragging of the brake shoes on the rotor of the disic brake. Numerous means for sealing the housing bore have been proposed in the prior art. Meyer et al. U. S. PatentNo. 4,039,053 entitled PROTECTING DEVICE FOR THE CYLINDRICAL SLIDING SURFACES OF A DISC BRAKE and issued August 2, 1977, discloses an exterior seal device used at the mouth or opening of the bore Kawaguchi et al. U. S. PatentNo. 4,156,532 entitled, SEALING DEVICE FOR AN AUTOMOBILEDISC BRAKE and issued May 29, 1979, discloses a design for the interior annular seal received in the interior seal groove and flexible disc brake boot seals are disclosed byBrainard et al. U. S. Patent No. 4,270,442 entitled DISCBRAKE BOOT , issued June 2, 1981, and Alexander et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,327,925 entitled DISC BRAKE BOOT SEALMETHOD AND ARTICLE and issued May 4, 1982. However, the prior art has failed to provide a solution to the corrosion buildupproblem experie nced by the land disposed between the interior seal groove and exterior boot seal opening. The present invention provides a corrosionresistant barrier which prevents oxidation of the land and sub sequent lockup of the phenolic piston, while providing a low friction surface for engagement with the slidable phenolic piston. A protective barrier is disposed about the perimeter or surface of the land to provide protection from moisture and prevent corrosive buildup, and provide the low friction surface for engagement with the surface of phenolic piston, to preclude lockup of the piston with the housing bore. The barrier may comprise a flexible annular seal having a U shaped groove about the circumference thereof, which may be snap fitted into engagement with the land. Alternatively, the protective barrier may be coated onto the perimeter of the land, by spray methods well known in the art.The protective barrier comprises a protective phenolic material such as polytetrafluoroethylene, commonly known as Teflon R , a registered trademark of E. I. Dupont d Nemours, Co. The invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings wherein Figure 1 is a section view of a disc brake assembly Figure 2 is an enlarged cross sectional view taken of the encircled area of Figure 1 and Figure 3 is an isometric view of a protective annular seal in accordance with the present invention. Referring now to the drawings and in particular toFigure 1, the disc brake assembly is referenced generally by numeral 10. Disc brake assembly 10 includes a housing 11 with arm 12 extending over a rotor 22 and aligned with a friction element 18. The housing 11 includes a housing bore 14 receiving a piston 16 therein, piston 16 being aligned with a friction element 20. During braking, piston 16 moves toward the rotor 22 to bias the friction element 20 into engagement with the rotor. Reaction forces acting through the arm 12 move the housing 11 to bias the outer friction element 18 into engagement with rotor 22. Engagement of the friction elements with the rotor creates braking torque which is transmitted to a torque plate arm 25. Housing bore 14 includes an opening 30 with a pair of seal receiving openings located adjacent the opening 30. Located within bore opening 30 is interior seal groove 40 with an annular seal 42 received in groove 40. Exterior boot seal opening 50 is located at bore opening 30 and receives end 62 of flexible boot seal 60. The opposite end 64 of boot seal 60 engages the circumference of piston 16 and is displaced therewith during movement of the piston relative to housing 11. Seal opening 50 and seal groove 40 cooperate to define a land 70 disposed between the opening and groove. The land 70 extends circumferentially about the bore 14, and in prior art designs engages the surface of piston 16. This is a standard construction for many different disc brake assemblies. Disposed about the perimeter or surface of the land 70 is a protective barrier 80. As shown in the enlarged illustration of Figure 2, protective barrier 80 completely covers the land to provide corrosion protection and a low friction surface engaging the surface of piston 16. The protective barrier should provide not only low friction engagement with the surface of the pis n but also provide complete sealing of the land from moisture and other fluids which would cause oxidation of the land, the subsequent corrosive buildup or oxidation causing a biting into or gouging of the piston surface and piston lockup during or after operation of the disc brake assembly.A phenolic material such as polytetrafluoroethylene, commonly known as Teflon R , provides an excellent corrosionresistant material which effects low friction engagement with the surface wall of the piston. Figure 3 illustrates an embodiment of the protective barrier 80. The barrier may comprise a flexible, annular barrier 90 made of polytetrafluoroethylene and having a U shaped groove 92 about its circumference. The barrier 90 may be simply snap fitted into engagement with land 70. Another form of the present invention which will provide complete encasement of the land by a protective barrier such as polytetrafluoroethylene, comprises spraying the protective material onto the land in order to protectively coat it from the effects of oxidation. The spraying may be accomplished by methods well known in the art, utilizing the usual masking techniques to protect the other portions of the bore and housing that are not to be sprayed and protectively coated. The present invention provides an inexpensive, easily manufactured and assembled protective barrier for protecting the land of a disc brake construction from the deteriorating effects of oxidation, which so often leads to lockup of the piston when braking has ceased. The phenolic material comprising polytetrafluoroethylene may be applied not only by spray coating, but a flexible, annular barrier may be snap fitted into engagement with the land. The protective barrier has sufficient density so that it will not be extruded outwardly by the seals which engage the sides of the protective barrier, and will provide excellent protection from oxidation. There are many other modifications feasible by one skilled in the art and these modifications are covered by the appended claims.
