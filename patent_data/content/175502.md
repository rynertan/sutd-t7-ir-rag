# A discharge tube for a high pressure metal vapour discharge lamp and a method of manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A discharge tube for a high pressure metal vapour dis charge lamp has a translucent alumina tubular body 6 and end plates 1, 1 bonded to respective end portions of the body 6 . To improve its resistance to chemical corrosion, the lower end plate 1 is bonded to the alumina tubular body 6 at the same time as the green or calcined body 6 is rendered translucent by firing. The second end plate 1 which also carries an elec trode support member 3 is bonded to the other end of the translucent alumina tubular body by means of a frit 7 .
