# Mechanical seal assembly with coolant circulation structure.

## Abstract
Shaft 12 rotates within a gland ring 17 and carries a first rotating seal ring which engages an axial end face of a stationary seal ring mounted in the gland ring 17 and a second rotating sealing ring which engages an opposite end face of a second stationary seal ring. An annular channel 32 is defined between the stationary seal rings for the flow of coolant from inlet 36 to outlet 37 . Flow of coolant in a closed circuit through heat exchanger 39 is maintained solely by rotation of the shaft since a dam 41 prevents flow from the outlet 37 to the inlet 36 around the shaft and the inclined end faces 43 and 44 of the dam deflect the coolant into and out of the channel 32 . The arrangement operates in both directions of rotation of the shaft, the coolant flow being in opposite directions around the circuit. While designed for a double or tandem seal the coolant circulation can also be used with a single seal.
