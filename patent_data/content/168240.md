# FASTENER ASSEMBLY WITH HEAT SHRINKABLE FILM COVER

## Abstract
An elongate fastener assembly 10 comprising a flexible polymeric backing strip 12 from which project a multiplicity of headed stems 18 adapted to engage loops on materials pressed against the heads 20, and an open porous perma nent attachment layer 22 attached to the surface of the backing strip 12 opposite the stems 18 which has sufficient open area to receive foam to permanently attach the fastener assembly 10 to a foamed article. The fastener assembly 10 has a heat shrinkable film cover means overlaying the heads 20 attached to the edges of the backing strip 12 that will shrink transversely to expose the heads 20 upon the application of heat.
