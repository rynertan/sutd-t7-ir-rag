# A drill boom arrangement.

## Abstract
A drill boom arrangement comprises a boom proper 10 that is universally pivotably mounted on a support plate 13 . The boom is swingable by means of two hydraulic cylinders 16, 17 that are coupled between the support plate and the boom to form a tripod with the boom. The hydraulic cylinders are located on each side of a vertical plane through the boom. A boom head 24 is universally pivotably mounted on the outer end of the boom 10 and it carries a feed beam 40 for a rock drill 41 . The boom head is swingable by means of two hydraulic cylinders 27, 28 that are coupled between the boom and the boom head to form another tripod with the boom. These two tripods have similar geometry but the hydraulic cylinders of one tripod is located under the boom and the hydraulic cylinders of the other tripod is located above the boom. The left hand hydraulic cylinder of one tripod is hydraulically coupled in series with the right hand hydraulic cylinder of the other tripod and vice versa so as to provide for parallel displacement of the feed beam when the boom is being swung.
