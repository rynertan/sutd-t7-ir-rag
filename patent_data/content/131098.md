# A TRANSLATION ROTATION POSITIONING DEVICE

## Abstract
This is a device that enables one to control the translation and rotation of an element 15A, B relative to a light beam 38. The device has a rotatable member 12 having a plurality of position identifying circumferentially spaced openings 14A, B, C, D therein as well as code aperture 16A, B, C for the transmission of a light beam. The rotatable member 12 is mounted on a rotating mounting 20 driven from a motor 26. The mounting 20 is carried by a housing 22 which can be translated by motor 34. The code apertures 16 are read by an optical head 18 and the positional information used in the control of motor 26.
