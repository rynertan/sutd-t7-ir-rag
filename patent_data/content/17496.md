# Blasting cartridge, its manufacture and its use in priming ANFO.

## Abstract
A blasting cartridge 1 has a tubular chamber 4 containing a water bearing blasting agent, and a longitudinal tunnel 6 adjacent to the tubular chamber 4 and integral therewith. Preferably, the tunnel 6 is full length and con tinuous and has holes 11 for threading a detonating cord 17 therethrough and for holding the cord firmly against the tubular chamber 4 for the cord priming of the cartridges. In primer assemblies, the tunnel 6 also can be used to hold a cap or booster 12 in place, and for lacing cap wires 13 or a low energy detonating cord. A preferred cartridge is made continuously in a series by wrapping a web of film having a row of holes along one edge so as to form a tube and an outer flap containing the holes, and sealing the tube and the flap so as to form a tunnel containing the holes in its outer portion, the wrapping being performed so that either the inner or outer portion of the tunnel is circumferentially longer than the other.
