# DIAGNOSTIC DEVICE FOR A SYSTEM FOR CONTROLLING THE STOPPING AND RESTARTING OF AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE FOR MOTOR VEHICLES

## Abstract
The device allows the monitoring and diagnosis of the functioning of a system comprising a plurality of electrical sensors 3, 4 which produce two level signals indicative of the condition of members which control the running of the engine and or of respective monitored parameters or ranges, and an electronic monitoring and control unit 5 with a microprocessor 6 , connected at input to the sensors 3,4 and at output actuators 8 for causing the engine to stop and restart. The diagnostic device also includes interrogation means 6 for carrying out a succession of sequential cyclical scans of the outputs of at least some of the sensors 3, 4 , and for generating, at each scan, a serial signal A comprising a plurality of two level signal portions, each indicative of the level of signal produced at the output of a respective sensor 3, 4 . A signalling device 2 is electrically connectible to the interrogation means 6 to convert the portions of the serial signal A into corresponding perceptible signals and permit the functioning of the stop start device to the minitored and diagnosed.
