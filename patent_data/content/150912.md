# ANESTHESIA TUBING CONNECTIONS

## Abstract
Improved connectors are disclosed for a Bain anesthesi ology circuit. At the end remote from the patient, positive con nections are made to the anesthesiology gas supply tube. The construction of the fitting 44 for the exhaust is such as to apply a crank action, facilitating tight insertion of the fitting 44 into an exhaust connector. At the patient end a positive locking connection is made to the endotracheal tube or the like, and a secure connection permitting a certain degree of turning without twisting of the inner tube 72 is provided.
