## Description
Process for producing a printed circuit boardThe present invention relates to a process for producing a printed circuit board, and particularly to an improvement of a process for producing a printed circuit board wherein a conductive circuit is directly formed on an insulating substrate by nonelectrolytic plating.In recent years, there has been developed an art for producing a printed circuit board by directly and selectively depositing catalytically active metal particles on a substrate by a photochemical reaction and then immersing the substrate in a non electrolytic plating solution to form a circuit conductor only at portions where the metal particles are precipitated this art will hereinafter be referred to as photo forming , without using a copper clad laminated board, an etching resist, a plating resist or a catalyst containing substrate.This photo forming method comprises forming on the entire insulating substrate having a through hole, a light sensitive material layer which contains a metal capable of constituing catalytic nuclei for non electrolytic plating, in a reducible oxidized state and a light sensitive substance i.e. a light sensitive reducing agent capable of forming a reducing agent upon absorption of radiant energy, then selectively exposing portions expected to form a circuit, thereby to reductively precipitate metal particles which are catalytically active for the non electrolytic plating, and then immersing thus treated substrate in a nonelectrolytic plating solution to form a circuit conductor on the portion where the metal particles are precipitated U.S. Patent No. 3,772,078 .A typical example of this method will be described as follows a An insulating substrate having a through hole is coated on its surface and on the inner wall surface of the through hole, with an aqueous light sensitive solution containing a light sensitive reducing agent composition such as a copper salt and a surface active agent, and then dried.b A negative film is directly overlaid on this substrate, and exposure is conducted by a ultraviolet ray thereby to precipitate metal particles such as copper, which constitute catalytic nuclei for plating.c After removing the negative film, non reacted light sensitive material remaining on the surface of the substrate is washed off with water.d The substrate is immersed in a non electrolytic plating solution and plating copper is precipitated on the metal particles, whereby a conductor circuit is obtained.In the production of a printed circuit board by such a photo forming method, there is a drawback that nonplated fine portions hereinafter referred to as plating voids 1 will be left on the inner surface of the through hole, and the reliability of the electric connection of the through hole will thereby be impaird, although there is no problem for the formation of the circuit on the flat surface of the substrate.The present invention is intended to eliminate such a drawback inherent to the conventional photo forming method, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a process for producing a printed circuit board, whereby it is possible to effectively carry out the formation of a circuit at the through hole portion, thereby ensuring the reliability of the electric connection of the through hole portion of the circuit board.From a study of the cause for the formation of plating voids at the through hole portion in the production of a printed circuit board according to the conventional photo forming method, it has been found that the formation of plating voids are based on the following cause. Namely, even when a light is radiated from both sides of the insulating substrate, no adequate light will reach the inside of a bore constituting the through hole which is a cylindrical pass through bore, whereby the exposure will be inadequate and the precipitation of the metal particles will be insufficient. Thus, non plated fine portions i.e. plating voids are likely to be left.The present inventors have conducted extensive researches on the process for producing a printed circuit board by the photo forming method comprising the above steps a to d , whereupon it has been found that the above object can be attained by depositing fine particles of a light sensitive oxide semiconductor on the inner wall surface of the pass through bore constituting the through hole, prior to the application of the aqueous light sensitive material solution. Thus, the present invention has been accomplished.According to the present invention, there is provided a process for producing a printed circuit board, comprising A a step of providing an adhesive layer on one side or both sides of an insulating substrates B a step of roughening, and imparting a hydrophilic property to, the surface of said adhesive layer by a physical or chemical method D a step of forming on the substrate a light sensitive material layer containing a metal in a reducible oxidized state capable of forming catalytic nuclei for non electrolytic plating, and a light sensitive reducing agent E a step of reductively precipitating metal particles constituting catalytic nuclei by selectively exposing said light sensitive material layer andF a step of forming a conductor circuit layer by nonelectrolytic plating after removing non exposed portions of said light sensitive material layer wherein the improvement comprises providing between the step B and the step D , a step C of depositing fine particles of a light sensitive metal oxide semiconductor on at least the inner wall surface of a through hole.As the insulating substrate which is used in the present invention, there may be mentioned a plastic plate, a ceramic plate, a laminated board containing a resin, or a metal plate coated on its surface with an insulating layer.As the adhesive which is provided on the abovementioned insulating substrate according to the present invention, there may be mentioned an adhesive comprising a polyester as the main component, an adhesive comprising an epoxy resin as the main component, an adhesive comprising a phenol resin as the main component, an adhesive comprising a polyvinyl acetate as the main component, and an adhesive comprising a diene type synthetic rubber as the main component. The adhesive comprising a diene type synthetic rubber as the main component is particularly desirable for the reason that a superior firm adhesion is thereby obtainable.As the adhesive containing such a diene type synthetic rubber, there are, for instance, a butadiene polymer, a butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer, an isoprene rubber, a chloroprene rubber, an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer or a mixture of two or more of these substances, or a proper mixture of these substances with a thermosetting resin such as an epoxy resin or a phenol resin or a reinforcing material such as silica gel, zirconium silicate or magnesium silicate. Thus, in the case where the adhesives containing these diene type synthetic rubbers are employed, a high adhesion is given to the circuit layer which is important for a printed circuit. The adhesives are applied to predetermined portions of the substrate in a form of a solution, and hardened by heating. The method for roughening and imparting a hydrophilic property to the surface of the adhesive layer thus formed, may be a chemical or phisical method. As the chemical method, there may be mentioned, roughening by ethcing with use of an oxidizing agent such as chromic acid, a chromate, a permanganate, chromic acid sulfuric acid, or chromic acid sulfuric acid phosphoric acid. The chromic acid sulfuric acid system is particularly desirable for the reason that the plated layer thereby obtained will give a strong adhesion. Further, as the physical method, there may be mentioned, a mechanical roughening method such as a liquid honing or a blast method, a ultraviolet ray radiation method, etching by sputtering, a discharge treatment method such as corona, or a plasma treating method.As the light sensitive metal oxide semiconductor to be used in the present invention, there may be mentioned, titanium dioxide TiO2 , zinc oxide Z nO , tin dioxide SnO2 or silica SiO2 . In this case, the term light sensitive is meant in a broad sense for the sensitivity to a electromagnetic radiation such as a visible ray, a ultraviolet ray, a X ray, or electron rays. It is assumed that the metal oxide semiconductor serves to catalytically assist the reaction of the light sensitive material which will be described hereinafter. Accordingly, the amount of its deposition may be very small and yet it is possible to facilitate the reaction of the light sensitive reducing agent to precipitate an adequate amount of metal catalytic nuclei even when the amount of light reaching the inner wall of the bore constituting the through hole is slight.There are various possible methods to deposit the light sensitive metal oxide semiconductor on the inner wall of the bore constituting the through hole.However, a simple and practical method may be such that a powder of said semiconductor is despersed in water to obtain a suspension, and the entire substrate is immersed in the suspension and then dried. At the time of dispersing it in water, a proper surface active agent may preferably be used. According to this method, a desirable phenomenon takes place such that during the process of drying after the immersing, the semiconductor powder deposits in a relatively thick state on the inner wall of the through hole or therearound. Further, the semiconductor powder deposits also on the entire surface of the substrate, and this does not bring about any problem.The finer the powder of the light sensitive metal oxide semiconductor is, the more uniformly it can be deposited, and the better the dispersion and the floating condition become when it is dispersed to form a suspension. As such a semiconductor powder, there is, for instance, a commercially available powder having a particle size of about 0.03 to 0.5 pm, which is useful for the process of the present invention.The amount of deposition of the light sensitive metal oxide semiconductor on the inner wall surface of the through hole may be very small. In the case where the substrate is immersed in the suspension as mentioned above, it will suffice to use a suspension wherein the semiconductor powder is dispersed in an amount of e.g.from 0.5 to 5 parts by weight into 100 parts by weight of water.In the present invention, as the metal which is contained in the light sensitive material layer formed on the insulating substrate having deposited thereon the above mentioned light sensitive oxide semiconductor and which is in a reducible oxidized state and serves as a catalyst for non electrolytic plating, there may be used salts of gold, silver, platinum, palladium, copper, nickel, cobalt and iron. As the light sensitive reducing agent, there may be used aromatic diazo compounds, iron salts, anthraquinone derivatives, azido compounds, etc. Further, reduction facilitating agents, surface active agents or solvents such as pentaerythritol, or sorbitol, may properly be incorporated. The substrate is immersed in the above mentioned light sensitive solution, and then dried to form a light sensitive material layer on the entire surface.Then, a ultraviolet ray is selectively radiated to this substrate with use of e.g. a negative film, to form plated catalytically active metal particles in a desired circuit pattern. The light source may be a diffusion type light source or a parallel light source. However, in a case of forming fine patterns, the parallel light source is desirable.In the present invention, the non electrolytic plating to form, by precipitation, a conductive circuit along the selectively exposed portion, is carried out by the use of, for instance, a non electrolytic copper plating solution, a non electrolytic nickel plating solution or a non electrolytic gold plating solution. Thus, as the non electrolytic plating solution, a non electrolytic copper solution is suitable, and as its composition, there may be mentioned, for instance, a copper sulfate ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid formaldehyde system, or the same system suitably incorporated with sodium hydroxide, dipyridyl, or polyethylene oxide as the case requires. Further, as the plating conditions, it is usual that the bath temperature is from 50 to 780C and a pH is from 12.0 to 13.0.As described hereinabove, according to the present invention, in the production of a printed circuit board by a phto forming method, fine particles of the light sensitive metal oxide semiconductor are deposited on the inner wall surface of the through hole, whereby the sensitivity of the light sensitive material layer formed on the inner wall of the bore constituting the through hole is increased, and accordingly the photochemical reaction can adequately be proceeded even with a small amount of exposure. This is due to the fact that upon exposure, the light sensitive oxide semiconductor is capable of reductively precipitating the metal contained in the light sensitive solution in an oxidized state. Thus, it is possible to adequately precipitate metal particles serving as a plating catalyst at the inner wall of the through hole, and to eliminate the formation of plating voids.Thus, the process of the present invention may be said to be a process for producing a highly dependable printed circuit board superior in the reliability of the connection of the through hole, based on the photoforming method.Now, Examples of the present invention will be described below Example 1.An adhesive having the following composition was applied to both sides of a paper epoxy type laminated board, and heated at 1100C for 20 minutes and then at l700C for further 40 minutes for hardening, whereby an adhesive hardened layer having a thickness of about 40 microns was formed. Then, a pass through bore which constitutes a through hole was formed.Composition of the adhesive Nitrile rubber A methylethyl ketone solution containing 20 by weight of HYCAR 1072 Trade name, produced by Nippon Zeon Co., Ltd. ........... 250 parts by weight Phenol resin A methanol solution containing 50 by weight of NIKANOL PR 1440M Trade name, produced by Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc. ....... 50 parts by weight Epoxy resin A methylethyl ketone solution containing 80 by weight of EPICOAT 1001 Trade name, produced by Shell Petrochemical Co., Ltd. ...,....... 31 parts by weight Acid anhydride type hardener A butyl cellosolve solution containing 20 by weight of KAYAHARD CLA Trade name, produced by Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd. .... 13 parts by weight Silica powder Trade name num 200, produced by Nippon Aerozil Co., Ltd. .... 10 parts by weightThe substrate formed with the above adhesive layer was imr mersed in an oxidizing agent solution comprising 75 g l of chromic acid anhydride, 300 mQ Q of concentrated sulfuric acid, the rest being water, for 15 minutes, whereby the entire surface was roughened by the oxidizing treatment.
