# PROCESS FOR MAKING A MASK USED IN X RAY PHOTOLITHOGRAPHY

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a mask for use in x ray photo lithography includes the steps of coating a set of wafers 20 with boron nitride 22 . The tension in the boron nitride is measured by using a capacitive probe 26 to measure bowing in a set of test wafers. The remaining wafers are attached to a pyrex ring 28 , and the boron nitride is removed from one side of the wafers. A circular hole is then etched in the wafer, and a layer of tantalum 32 and gold 34 are formed on the remaining boron nitride membrane. The gold 34 is patterned via a sputter etching process. Power is reduced at the end of the sputter etching process slowly to reduce mechanical stress in the mask. The tantalum 32 is then etched via a reactive ion etching process. In this way, an x ray transparent boron nitride membrane is used to support x ray opaque gold.
