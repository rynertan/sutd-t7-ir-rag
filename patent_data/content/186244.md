## Description
The present invention relates to an edible fat, to margarines and reduced fat spreads containing said fat and to a process for producing said fat. There is a need of margarines and reduced fat spreads of the low calorie type which have a good consistency, which means a good spreadability, plasticity and toughness, which are stable under distribution conditions, under conditions prevailing in the refrigerator and on the table at home. It is further important that such products display a good melting behaviour on consumption, which means that little or no waxiness is perceived, and good coolness properties, which means that the products melt quickly under the temperature and shear conditions prevailing in the mouth, giving an oral response similar to that perceived on consumption of dairy butter. There is also a need of an economical process for producing fats which can be used in said margarines and reduced fat spreads, which means that relatively cheap ingredients and simple operations should be used. In particular, the amount of fats to be fractionated should be kept at a minimum and the use of lauric fats should, if possible, be reduced to a minimum. Applicants have found fat blends and a process for producing such which meet the above desiderata to a great extent. The fat blends according to the invention have the following characteristics The fat blends may further comprise lower melting triglycerides such as U₃ and SU₂ triglycerides which are liquid at 10 C and do not substantially contribute to the structure of the fat blend. The fat blends of the present invention preferably display the following fat solids profile expressed in percentages of crystallized fat at the given temperatures, measured by nuclear magnetic resonance NMR as described in Fette, Seifen, Anstrichmittel, The perception of waxiness on consumption of edible spreads produced from the fat blends according to the invention is avoided owing to the low N₃₅ value. The requirement regarding N₃₅ is met be ensuring that the level of triglycerides S₃ from 3 saturated fatty acids containing 16 or more carbon atoms plus triglycerides S₂E from 2 saturated fatty acids containing 16 or more carbon atoms and 1 unsaturated fatty acid in the trans configuration containing 16 or more carbon atoms, is kept at a minimum and particularly between 1 and 10 . The level of fat solids at 20 C is important for the stand up properties, the plasticity, the storage stability and the coolness of the product. The requirement regarding the N₂₀ value is mainly achieved by ensuring that the fat blend contains a relatively high level of triglycerides S₂U from 2 saturated fatty acids containing 16 or more carbon atoms and 1 mono cis or polyunsaturated fatty acid with 18 or more carbon atoms ranging from 12 35 in view of their high solubility at 20 C in oils , and particularly between 15 and 35 . The role of S₂U triglycerides can partly be taken by S₂M triglycerides. The level of S₂M triglycerides will generally not exceed 10 and will preferably range from 0 to 7 . For achieving butter like consistency, the level of fat solids at 10 C should preferably be higher than 30 as high as acceptable , but should remain below 60 . The requirement with respect to the N₁₀ value is met by ensuring that the sum of the levels of triglycerides S₃ from 3 saturated C₁₆ or more fatty acids, triglycerides S₂E from 2 saturated C₁₆ or more fatty acids and 1 unsaturated trans fatty acid, triglycerides SE₂ from 1 saturated C₁₆ or more fatty acids and 2 trans unsaturated fatty acids and triglycerides S₂U as hereinbefore defined ranges from 30 to 60 . Applicants have further found that, in order to exploit the function of the S₂U triglycerides in the best possible way, the ratio of symmetrical to asymmetrical S₂U triglycerides should vary between 0.6 and 2.0, preferably between 0.8 and 1.8. Within this ratio the best possible combination of good stand up property at 20 C and good plasticity at about 10 C are achieved. The fat blends according to the invention can be used for producing edible emulsion spreads, particularly W O emulsions of the margarine or reduced fat spread type containing 20 to 70 fat, in a way known The present invention also relates to a process for producing the above defined fat blends, which process comprises mixing Fat a comprises one or more hydrogenated fats which may be randomly interesterified. In this fat the ratio of the triglycerides SSE SEE generally ranges from 1 3 to 3 1, and preferably from 1 2.5 to 2.5 1. Fat a preferably constitutes 5 60 of the total fat blend. Fat a is preferably selected such that it contains less than 20 S₂U triglycerides. Fat a is, for instance, obtainable by random interesterification of a mixture of a liquid oil hydrogenated under conditions conducive to the formation of trans fatty acids, e.g. using a sulphur poisoned nickel catalyst at relatively high temperatures about 180 C , and palm fat. The preferred ratio of hydrogenated oil to palm fat is about 80 20. Random interesterification is carried out in a way known The liquid oil which is subjected to hydrogenation may consist of soybean oil, rapeseed oil, maize oil, sunflower oil, grapeseed oil, safflower oil, etc. Hydrogenation is usually carried out to a melting point ranging from 30 to 45 C. It is, of course, possible first to interesterify the liquid oil and the palm fat and subsequently to hydrogenate the interesterified mixture to the desired melting point. Another example of a suitable component a consists of a palm olein fraction, e.g. obtained by dry fractionation of palm oil at a temperature between 24 and 38 C, separating the olein from the high melting stearin and subsequently hydrogenating the palm olein to a level of trans preferably exceeding 30 and preferably ranging from 50 to 60 . Still another example of component a may consist of a palm mid fraction obtained by dry or wet fractionation and which is subsequently hydrogenated. Dry fractionation can be carried out, for instance, as described in EP 0078568. Component b can be a mixture of symmetrical triglycerides or a natural mixture of triglycerides from e.g. palm oil, cottonseed oil, tallow, shea fat, cocoa butter or olein fractions thereof or mixtures of these oils and fats. The olein fractions can be obtained by fractionation in the absence of a solvent dry fractionation , in the presence of a solvent such as acetone or hexane or in the presence of an aqueous solution containing a detergent Lanza fractionation . Preferably dry fractionation is applied, since it is cheaper and less complex. For instance, palm oil can be fractionated at a temperature between 24 and 38 C into a higher melting fraction stearin , which is separated, and into an olein fraction, which can be isolated and used as component b as such or mixed with e.g. a tallow olein, non fractionated palm oil or cottonseed oil. Component b can constitute 5 to 40 of the total fat blend. Component c is obtainable, for instance, by interesterification of a mixture of non hydrogenated triglycerides from saturated fatty acids with a chain length of 16 or more carbon atoms and cis unsaturated fatty acids with a chain length of 16 or more carbon atoms, said saturated fatty acids constituting 25 to 55 of the total amount of fatty acids. Said interesterified mixture may be fractionated, if necessary, to reduce the level of triglycerides S₃ from 3 saturated C₁₆ or higher fatty acids to less than about 6 . Component c is preferably substantially free from trans fatty acids. A suitable component c may include an olein obtained by randomly interesterifying palm oil and dry fractionating the interesterified mixture to obtain the olein and a stearin which is discarded or used in subsequent interesterification batches with adjusted fatty acid composition. Component c may comprise an interesterified mixture of one or more oils such as rapeseed oil, maize oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil, safflower oil, etc., part of which may be hydrogenated, such as soybean oil hydrogenated to a melting point of 60 C, palm fat hydrogenated to a melting point of 58 C or a palm stearin. To a mixture of components a b c up to 25 of a liquid oil or fat e having a melting point not exceeding 28 C can be added. Examples of e may include laurics such as coconut fat, palmkernel fat, babassu fat, murmuru fat, ouricurum fat, etc. The use of such lauric fats is preferably limited to 0 to 10 , since at higher levels butter likeness decreases. The rest of the added fat will then consist of an oil liquid at 20 C, such as sunflower oil or soybean oil. A preferred process according to the present invention involves using a level of fractionated fat not exceeding 50 . This means that fats b and c or mixtures thereof when present as e.g. oleins are used in amounts lower than 50 , preferably lower than 40 and ideally in amounts which may range from 10 to 40 . The invention will now be illustrated in the following examples. In these examples and in the specification all percentages are by weight. A fat blend was produced from 15 of fat component a , 35 of fat component b and 50 of fat component c .
