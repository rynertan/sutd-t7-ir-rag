## Description
Title An auxiliary circuit in a circuitry comprising C MOS integrated circuit components.The invention relates to a circuit comprising one or more IC components of the C MOS type, means being provided to detect failures in the components of the circuit. Such circuits are generally used in control circuits of control processes of various nature. As an example, reference may be made to a control circuit for an electronic burner ignition device. The so called double fail safe principle may be used as a provision for detecting failures in the components of the circuit. This principle means that two identical circuits must be provided, connected in parallel, in which the outputs of the corresponding sections of the circuits are compared by a comparator and in which a signal, unequal to zero, is considered as a failure. One of the parallel connected circuits may be considered as the proper control circuit, while the other performs the function of a comparing circuit. A disadvantage of this principle is, that the failure chance is doubled, while both circuits are to be adjusted precisely one with respect to the other. In addition, this detection principle involves substantial increase of the cost price in comparison with a single circuit. The invention aims at overcoming the above mentioned disadvantage and for this purpuse it makes use of the property, that the IC s of theC MOS type, applied in the circuit, have a low and controlled current collection and that a failure of such an IC is expressed in a significant increase of the current collection. The fail safe circuit proposed by the invention is characterized by auxiliary circuit for detecting failures, which is adapted to monitor the current collection by the circuit, and to generate a failure signal, as soon as the monitored current collection exceeds a pre adjusted thresholdlevel. The said auxiliary circuit may be realised in a simple and inexpensive way. In a practical embodiment, the auxiliary circuit includes a voltageregulator, having its control input connected to a thyristor, by which the voltage regulator may be switched on and off respectively a transistor with an adjustment circuit, adapted to make the transistor issue a signal,as soon as the current collection by the circuit exceeds a pre adjusted thresholdlevel, resulting in the voltage regulator and the power supply of the circuit being switched off. Prefarebly, the components of the auxiliary circuit are selected and connected in such a way, that in the event of a failure in one of the components of the auxiliary circuit, the power supply of the circuit will be switched off in the same way, as described above with reference to the main circuit. The invention will be hereinafter further described with referance to the drawing, in which a practical embodiment of the auxiliary circuit is shown. The circuit shown in the drawing is supplied by a supply voltage V0, which in praxis may have a value between 15 and 24V. The voltage Vg is transferred to a fixed voltage of 12V by the voltage regulator ICI and the resistors R1 and R4. The resistors R1 and R4 are selected in such a way, that there will be a voltage V2 of 1O,8V across the resistor R1. Upon the supply voltage V0 being switched on, the capacitor C3 will cause the vol tage V1 to increase slowly to a value of 12V. The voltage V1 is supplied to a 12V failure relay, so as to energize the latter.The voltage V1 is also connected to the positive supply termfnal of the circuit X, via resistor R5. The circuit X comprises logic ICTs of the C MOS type. The negative supply terminal of the circuit X is connected to the zero voltage of the power supply. Under normal conditions, i.e. without failures in the compo nents, the current f low I1 received by the circuit X will be very small.The voltage difference V, VB between the emitter and base of the transistorTr will than be much smaller than IV, due to which the transistor Tr will be in its blockingetate. There will be no collectorcurrent IC tlowing. The diode D2 in this example used as a zener of 0,7V is applied to get a better adjustment of the voltage VE and of the threshold level, at which the transistor Tr begins to conduct. The gate current 1G to the thyristor Th received from circuit X through the resistors R2 and R3 is below the thres hold level, at which the thyristor begins to conduct, sothat the thyristor Th is blocked. As soon as a failure appears in the circuit X the current flow I1 will increase to a value far above 1000 A. The voltage drop across resistor R5 will increase to such an extent, that the base voltage Vg of the transis tor will become at least 0,6V below the emitter voltage VE, sothat the tran sistor Tr will get in the conduction state. As a result of this a current IC begins to flow, which controls the thyristor Th, via the current divider achieved by the resistors K3 and R2. The current divider R3, R2 ensures that the inputcurrent of the thyristor Th, which is applied via transistor Tr froe the 12V power supply, will not becone too high.The gate current 1G will now have a value above the threshold level, at which the thyristor gets in the conduction state thus the thysristor Th begins to conduct. The capacitor C1 ensures that the transistor Tr will put enough energy into the gate of Th, sothat the thyristor Th will get into conduction immediately and without oscillation phenomena. The resistor R1 is now short circuited by the thyristor Th, due to which the output voltage Vl of the voltage regulator decreases rapidly to 1,2V. The power supply of the circuit X is thereby interrupted. The decrease of V1 causes the failure relay 12V ,fed by the voltage V1, to drop, and this may control a secundairy circuit, indicating a failure in the circuit X, for example by means of a sound or lightsignal. The auxiliary circuit further comprises a zenerdiode D1 of 15V and a capacitor C2. The capacitor C2 provides that the currentpulses caused by switching actions in the circuit X will not cause the transistor Tr to come into conduction, so that false control signals to the thyristor Th are avoided. The zenerdiode D1 contributes a protection against a too high value of the supply voltage V1. When the voltage V1 becomes too high, the diodeD1 controls the thyristor Th, due to which the latter Th gets into conduction and the supply voltage will be interrupted. Upon removal of the failure in the circuit X the thyristor may be reset into the blocking state by depressing a reset button, which will short circuit the thyristor, whereafter the voltage V1 may rise again to 12v, as soon as the reset button is released. It is an advantage of the above auxiliary circuit that in case of failures in the components of the auxiliary circuit itself appearing as an interruption or short circuiting , a similar effect will occur, as described above with reference to failures in the components of the circuit X .The supply voltage of the circuit X will then also be interrupted. It may be understood, that the auxiliary circuit according to the invention is applicable in circuits for various purposes and that the values of the components of the implementation shown are used for illustra tion only.
