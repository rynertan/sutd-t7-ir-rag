# Improved polyphenylene ether compositions.

## Abstract
Improved polyphenylene ether compositions are de scribed. These compositions contain an amount of talc filler effective to provide an UL arc tracking rate of less than 1 inch minute. Improvement in the impact strength and other physical properties of these compositions may be obtained through incorporation of low molecular weight terblock copolymer having polystyrene endblocks and a rubber midblock.
