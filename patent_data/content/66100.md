# Method to improve subbing polyester support bases, subbed polyester support bases and photographic films comprising said improved support bases.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to an improved photo graphic polyester support base coated with a first hydropho bic subbing layer and a second hydrophilic subbing layer, the improvement consisting of having said second subbing layer derived from a hardener containing, aqueous coating composition including 1 gelatin, 2 a vinyl addition polym er compound and 3 a low viscosity highly sulfonated water soluble polyacetal compound derived from the reaction of an aldehyde sulfonic acid compound with a polyvinyl alcohol compound, the relative quantities of said gelatin and vinyl addition polymer compound to the polyacetal compound being such is to provide good adhesion characteristics without any significant loss in antistatic properties.
