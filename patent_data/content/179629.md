# Packet switching system.

## Abstract
In a packet switching system in which both data and speech packets are handled, speech packets, which have to be handled in a real time way, may be subjected to unacceptable delay if the medium is busy with a data packet when a speech packet is to be sent. This is because a data packet is relatively long, which would produce an unacceptable delay. To overcome this, if a speech packet arrives when a data packet is partly sent, the sending of the data packet is interrupted, and the speech packet is sent, and the residue of the data packet is sent when the transmission medium is free of speech. This residue is provided with a new header and handled as if it is a new data packet.
