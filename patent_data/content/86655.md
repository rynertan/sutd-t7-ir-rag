# Flame retardant polyorganosiloxane resin compositions.

## Abstract
Translucent polyorganosiloxane resin compositions ex hibiting acceptable levels of flame retardancy contain from 1 to 10 based on resin weight, of an organic halogen source in combination with finely divided glass particles. Translucent substrates coated with these resin compositions can be used in the exterior portions of buildings intended to be heated at least in part by solar energy.
