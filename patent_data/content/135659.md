## Description
DESCRIPTION IRRADIATION OF A POLYAMIDE COMPOSITION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to irradiation of a polyamide composition more particularly this invention relates to irradiating a polyamide composition which contains a hindered phenol compound. The treatment of polymeric materials with radiation has been reviewed by Zimmerman, J., In the RadiationChemistry of Macromolecules by Malcolm Dole, AcademicPress, N.Y. 1973. Abramova et al., Radiolysis and Radiation inducedOxidation of Polycaproamide in the Presence of SomeAntioxidants , European Polymer Journal Supplement, 1969, pp. 511 515, Pergamon Press, England, reviews the stabilizing effect of secondary aromatic amines and substituted phenols on the radiolysis and radiationinduced oxidation of polyepsiloncaproamide. Of particular interest in this study was the use of a hindered or substituted phenol, 2,2 methylene bis4 methyl 6 tert butyl phenol. This was included in a group of antioxidants used to prevent thermal oxidation of polyamides. The study was conducted using films of polyepsiloncaproamide which were 2 to 6 micrometers thick.The stabilizing action of the hindered phenol, 2,2 methylene bis 4 methyl 6 tert butyl phenol was found to be less than a variety of other materials tried and the stabilizing action only at the limit of the accuracy of measurement. Presently medical devices, such as syringes, are sterilized using ethylene oxide. However, ethylene oxide is a suspected carcinogen, and it has been projected that its use will be phased out in the next several years. Sterilization of various devices is expected to be conducted by the use of high energy radiation. Devices to be sterilized include devices made at least in part of polyamides. It is also contemplated that articles to be sterilized will be packaged in packages made at least in part of polyamides. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is a method comprising the step of irradiating a composition comprising a polymer, preferably a polyamide and a hindered phenol having the formula EMI2.1 wherein R1 is methyl, ethyl or an alpha branched alkyl group of from 3 10 carbons, R2 is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or an alpha branched alkyl group of from 3 10 carbons, x is from 2 6, n is from 2 6, it is recognized that when n is greater than one the alkyl phenol groups can vary in structure, and Z is selected from the group consisting of alkylenes, arylenes1 cyanurates, esters, amines, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, amides wherein the basic amide structure isEMI2.2 and mixtures thereof.Two preferred hindered phenols are EMI2.3 wherein x is 2 to 6 and y is 2 to 10 EMI3.1 wherein x is 2 to 6 and y is 2 to 10. The method of the present invention is particularly useful in sterilizing the polyamide composition and or articles made of the polyamide composition and in particular film. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present invention relates to the of irradiation of a composition comprising a polymer, preferably a polyamide and a hindered phenol. The hindered phenol has the general formula EMI3.2 wherein R1 is methyl, ethyl or an alpha branched alkyl group of from 3 10 carbons, R2 is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, or an alpha branched alkyl group of from 3 10 carbons, x is from 2 6, n is from 2 6, it is recognized that when n is greater than one the alkyl phenol groups can vary in structure, and Z is selected from groups consisting of alkylene, arylenes, cyanurates, esters, amines, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus, amides wherein the basic amide structure isEMI3.3 and mixtures thereof.The term polyamide used in the present invention is intended to include long chain synthetic polymers which have regularly recurring amide groups as an integral part of the main polymer chain, and hence, includes amide ester copolymers. Suitable polyamides can be prepared by polymerization of a difunctional monomer or equivalently, its cyclized lactam e.g., epsilon aminocaproic acid or caprolactam, respectively or by the reaction of a conjugate pair of monomers, for example, a diamide and a dicarboxylic acid e.g., hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid , or a linear amino aliphatic acid such as ll amino undecanoic acid.Suitable polylactams can be produced by the polymerization of lactam monomers of the formulaEMI4.1 where R is an alkylene group having from 3 to 12 or more carbon atoms, preferably from 5 to 12 carbon atoms. A preferred monomer is epsiloncaprolactam having 5 carbon atoms in the alkylene group. Lactam monomers in addition to epsiloncaprolactam include pyrollidone, piperdone, valerolactam, caprolactam, lauryllactam, etc.Also included are copolymers of two or more of the above or similar lactam monomers. Suitable diamines useful in the polymerization of polyamides include propanediamine, hexamethylenediamine, octamethylenediamine, etc. Suitable polycarboxylic acids include acids such as adipic acid, pimelic, suberic, sebacic, dodecanonic, etc. Also included are copolymers or blends of polyamides of the above two categories. Polyamides useful in the composition of the present invention preferably are polyepsiloncaprolactam, polyhexamethyleneadipamide, or mixtures thereof. Typically, the number average molecular weight of these polymers is between about 10,000 and about 50,000, preferably 15,000 to 40,000, and more preferably 20,000 to 30,000. This is because mechanical properties improve rapidly up to about 20,000 and processing starts becoming more difficult after 30,000. Polyepsiloncaprolactam or polyhexamethylene adipamide suitable for use herein can contain a variety of terminal functionality. Preferred terminal functionality is that containing a A carboxyl group attached to both ends of the polyamide chain b A carboxyl group attached to one end and an acetamide group attached to the other end of the polyamide chain c An amino group attached to both ends of the polyamide chain and d A carboxyl group attached to one end and an amino group attached to the other end of the polyamide chain. In addition to the polyamides discussed above, polyamide copolymers are useful in the alloys of the present invention. For the purpose of the present invention polyamide copolymers include polymers having two or more different monomers. Useful copolymers include but are not limited to the copolymers of epsilon caprolactam, and hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid epsilon caprolactam and ll amino undecanoic acid epsilon caprolactam and 12 amino dodecanonic acid hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid, and ll amino undecanoic acid and hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid, and 12 amino dodecanonic acid. Polyamide copolymers also include block copolymers such as copolymers containing polyamide blocks and polyether blocks. Useful polyamides include amorphous polyamides.Included in the amorphous polyamide polymers are copolymers of caprolactam, terephthalic acid and bis paminocyclohexyl methane with terephthalic acid or isophthalic acid. Useful amorphous polyamide copolymers are those disclosed in U.S. Serial No. 336,976, filedJanuary 4, 1982. A preferred copolymer contains 90 mol percent caprolactam, 5 mol percent terephthalic acid and 5 mol percent bis p aminocyclohexyl methane. Typical amorphous polyamide copolymers include Amidele transparent nylon sold by Union Carbide clear nylon 6 sold by Dynamit Nobel Chemikaliens TransparentPolyamide 55t with aliphatic, cycloaliphatic acid and aromatic basic components sold by Emser Industries and Durethan transparent polyamide containing isophorone diamine and isophthalic acid. The composition of the present invention includes the hindered phenol as described above. There can be up to 10 percent, preferably 0.01 to 10 percent, more preferably 0.02 to 3 percent, and most preferably 0.1 to 0.5 of the hindered phenol. Useful hindered phenols which come within the above noted formula are described in U.S. Patent No. 3,644,482 and U.S. Patent No.3,285,855 both hereby incorporated herein by reference. Two particularly preferred hindered phenols which are useful in the composition used in the method of the present invention includeEMI6.1 wherein x is 2 to 6 and y is 2 to 10,preferably used in the form of Irganoxe 1098 which has the formula EMI7.1 wherein x is 2 to 6 and y is 2 to 10, preferably used in the form of Goodrighte 3125 which has the formula EMI7.2 The composition of the present invention has been found to be able to be irradiated by ionizing radiation such as gamma radiation, election beam radiation, and xray beams, and maintain its physical properties, including viscosity, tensile properties, and film toughness. The composition of the present invention can be irradiated prior to forming, or formed and subsequently irradiated.The composition of the present invention can be irradiated in any suitable form including extrusions, moldings, film, and film and sheet laminations. Examples of the irradiation of the composition of the present invention include incidental irradiation of polyamide packages containing articles to be irradiated. Typical of such packages are film packets containing medical related articles, such as syringes, to be sterilized by radiation. The composition of the present invention can be used to make molded articles such as medical equipment to be sterilized. Articles made of the composition can be used in environments where they are exposed to irradiation. The composition can be irradiated in an oxygen containing environment. However, it has been found that in the absence of oxygen the composition of the present invention maintains its properties to a greater degree than in the presence of oxygen. Properties which are particularly affected include the viscosity and toughness. The effects of oxygen can be observed by comparing film irradiated in sheet form where there is greater surface exposure to oxygen with film on a roll where the film in the inner wrappings of the roll is shielded from exposure to oxygen by the outer wrappings. Film laminates including coextruded films containing at least one layer of the composition used in the present invention are preferred materials for use in packaging articles to be sterilized. A typical film laminate is a coextruded laminate of having outer layers of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer sandwiching an inner layer of the composition of the present invention. This is particularly useful since the outer layers act as a barrier to oxygen reaching the inner polyamide composition. The radiation for use to irradiate the composition of the present invention is ionizing radiation such as gamma radiation, electron beam radiation, and x radiation. The amount of radiation which the composition of the present invention can withstand depends on the configuration. In the form of a thin film, retention of properties is improved with doses of radiation up to 15Megarads Mrads , preferably 0.01 to 15 Mrads, more preferably 0.5 to 8 Mrads can. Most preferably doses of 2 to 5 Mrads is used in sterilization operations. Such operations can be for as long as necessary to sterilize. Typical conditions are 0.5 Mrads per hour.Preferably, the amount of radiation dose which can be used is up to an amount which will enable the composition of the present invention to maintain greater than 50 percent of its elongation as measured on a film according to ASTM Test No. D882 or ASTM Test No. D638. The radiation for use in sterilization processes is preferably gamma radiation by exposure to cobalt 60 Co60 gamma rays . The exposure of polyamides to radiation results in the generation of free radicals on the carbon atom adza cent to the nitrogen atom as discussed in Zimmerman, ibid., pp. 121 122. It is indicated that a variety of reaction sequences can subsequently occur. Reference is particularly made to Niman, M.B., Aging and Stabilization of Polymers, Consultants Bureau Enterprises, Inc.,NY, 1965, p. 235 and Saunders, K.J., Organic PolymerChemistry, Chapel and Hall, London, 1973, pp. 187 188.These references indicate that among the reactions which can occur in the absence of oxygen are chain cleavage and cross linking. In the presence of oxygen a variety of cleavage reactions can occur. The presence of oxygen has been found to accelerate the cleavage reactions relative to the cross linking reactions. The hindered phenols used in the method of the present invention are believed to intercept the peroxy radicals and reduce the cleavage reactions. Several examples are set forth below to illustrate the nature of the invention and the manner of carrying it out. However, the invention should not be considered as being limited to the details thereof. Irradiation experiments were conducted at IsomedixCorporation in Parsippany, New Jersey. Gamma radiation was used from a cobalt 60 Co60 source. Dosimeters were used by Isomedix to measure the radiation doses.They were accurate to about i .2 Mrad. Samples were rotated every .5 Mrad about every hour of exposure to reduce non uniformities of irradiation. The doses given by Isomedix are the minimum doses for each nominal value. For example, doses of 1.5, 3.0 and 5.0 Mrads are minimum doses with the maximum dose as much as 10 of the nominal value. The nylon used in the examples of the present invention was polyepsiloncaprolactam Nylon 6 . The nylon was irradiated in two different ways. The first or roll method was to irradiate the nylon while it was on the wind up roll. Except for the very outer layers of the roll, this method resulted in irradiation under conditions of minimal exposure to oxygen. The second or sheet method of radiation was conducted on 8 1 2 x 11 21.59 cm x 27.94 cm film sheets which had been cut from the roll. The films were placed between sheets of white paper, placed in envelopes between 10 and 50 sheets to an envelope and placed in a large cardboard box for irradiation. The irradiation of film in this manner resulted in a much higher degree of exposure to oxygen from the air surrounding each individual film. The films were prepared from polyepsiloncaprolactam pellets which were mixed with an appropriate amount of stabilizer in powder form. The pellet and powder mixture was shaken to insure a fairly uniform coating of the pellets. The coated pellets were then extruded and cast to form films. EXAMPLES 1 2 Nylon 6 compositions were made by first extruding the nylon pellets which had been physically blended with the powdered stabilizer through a 1 1 2 inch 3.81 cm Davis Standard Extruder with a barrel temperature of 5000F 2600C to 5100F 265.60C , a die temperature of 5000F 2600C to 5100F 265.60C , and a rate of 50 pounds 22.7 kg per hour. The blend was then dried followed by reextrusion through a 2 inch 5.1 cm single screw extruder with Zone 1 5100F 265.60C , Zone 2 5000F 2600C Zone 3 5000F 260.00C , Zone 4 4800F 248.90C . The extruded film was fed to a quench roll at 1800F 82.20C using a film die. The Nylon 6 has a formic acid viscosity of 75 and was sold as CAPRONe 8207F Nylon 6 produced by Allied Corporation. Comparative 1 was 100 percent Nylon 6.Example 1 was a blend of 99 by weight of Nylon 6 and 1 by weight of Irganox 1098 having the formula EMI11.1 Example 2 was 99 of Nylon 6 plus 1 of Irganox 1010 having the formula EMI11.2 The compositions were formed into film which was 2.5 mils 5x10 2 mm thick. The film was 12 inches 305 cm wide and 300 to 400 feet 91.4 to 121.9 m of film were formed into rolls. Each roll had an outer diameter of about 5 inches 12.7 cm and was on a 3 inch 7.6 cm cardboard tube. The rolls were irradiated at radiation levels of 0, 1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 Mrads as discussed above. The effect of radiation on the viscosity of the film is summarized in Table 1 below. The reduced viscosity was measured in m cresol solution of the polymer at a concentration C of 0.52 g dL at 250C.The specific viscosity, nSp, was calculated from the relative flow times of sample solution and pure solvent minus one, i.e. t sample tsOlvent l .

The Instron head speed was 1.0 in min. All of the films were between 2.2 and 3.3 mils 5.6 x 10 2 and 8.4 x 10 2mum thick. The results are summarized in Table 2 below.

There was about a 10 drop in Break Elongation and about a 15 drop in Tensile Strength at 4.5 Mrads. There was generally a slight improvement in Break Elongation andTensile Strength when using the stabilizers. Toughness data was calculated for 2.5 mil 6.4 x 10 2 mm film irradiated on a roll. The toughness is the BEssBSX106. The percent toughness retained is the average toughness retained for toughness in the machine and transverse directions. It is calculated by toughness at a given irradiation divided by toughness with no radiation times 100. The results are summarized in Tables 3 and 4 below.

EXAMPLES 3 4 A series of films was prepared in the same manner as those in Examples 1 and 2. These films were irradiated on the roll with minimum oxygen exposure.The films were between 1.0 and 1.2 mils 2.5 x 10 2 and 3.0 x 10 2 mm thick. Viscosity was measured in the same manner as in Examples 1 and 2 and is summarized inTable 5.

This may be due to slightly more oxygen exposure to the 1 mil 2.5 x 10 2 mm film than the 2.5 mil 6.4 x 10 2 mm film. An increasing viscosity at the 5.0 Mrad versus 3.0 Mrad suggests the cross linking reaction at this point are increasing molecular weight faster than chain scission is decreasing the molecular weight.

In Examples 1 and 2 the film tested had a thickness of 2.5 mils 6.4 x 10 2 mm compared to 1 mil 2.5 x 10 2 mm in Examples 3 and 4. It is noted that the film tested was of poorer quality. It is speculated that the poorer values may be due in part to the thinner films being more accessible to oxygen due to their higher surface to volume ratio.However, the addition of the stabilizer improved the toughness retention at all measured exposures in Examples 3 and.

EXAMPLES 26 28 In Examples 26 28 a one mil 2.5 x 10 2 mm layer of the polyamide compositions containing CAPRON 8207Nylon 6 8207 was coextruded between Wimil 3.8 x 10 2 mm layers of an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer EVA sold by Chemplex as Plexar I and having 5 mol percent vinyl acetate. The polyamide composition was first mixed under the same conditions as in described inExample 1. The polyamide composition was extruded through a 1 3 4 inch 1.91 cm diameter nominal Reifenhouser extruder operating at a screw speed of about 43 rpm and a temperature profile of Zone 1 4000F 2040C , Zone 24700F 2430C , Zone 3 5100F 2660C , and the adaptorZone at 4900F 2540C . The extruder motor drive load amperage was about 11 amps. The Plexar I was extruded through a 2 1 2 inch 6.35 cm diameter Davis Standard Extruder operating at a screw speed of about 31 rpm and a temperature profile of Zone 1 2000F 930C , Zone 2 3600F 1820C , Zone 34450F 2290C and Zone 5 4750F 2460C . The motor drive load amperage was about 45 amps. The extrudate from the extruders was passed to a coextrusion feedblock operating at adaptor zone temperatures of Zone 1 4750F 2460C , Zone 2 4840F 2510C , andZone 3 4890F 2540C . The laminate from the coextrusion adaptor went to a die having three zones at Zone 1 4870F 2530C r Zone 2 4870F 2530C , and Zone 3 4860F 2520C . The coextruded film was then cast on a roll at 800F, followed by a cooling roll at 800F, and another roll at 700F. The film was irradiated in sheet form and tested in accordance with the procedures of Examples 5 7.
