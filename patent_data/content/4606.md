## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING ANILINE COMPOUNDS This invention relates to preparation of thioalkyl aniline compounds which are useful as intermediates in the preparation of anthelmintic, antibacterial and fungicidal agents. Recently, a number of patents have described anthelmintics of the benzimidazole type. Examples are U. S. 3,956,499, U. S. 3,915,896, U. S. 3,095,991,U. S. 3,682,952, Dutch Application 75 06095, BritishPatent 1,424,773, etc. Despite the disclosures of these patents, the present method for the preparation of such intermediates useful in such applications have not been heretofore disclosed. In the prior art is shown methods of preparing alkyl aryl sulfides by the reaction of aryl thiocyanates with alcohols in the presence of alkali metal cyanides.Thus, Tanaka Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan , 44, pp. 2815 2820 1971 reacted o chlorophenyl thiocyanate and n propanol in the presence of sodium cyanide and obtained o chlorophenyl propyl sulfide in a yield of 29 percent. When the reaction was carried out in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide, a yield of 50 percent was realized. Tanaka also studied the reaction of diaryl disulfides with the cyanide ion and with dimethyl sulfide to obtain aryl alkyl sulfides, e.g. phenyl methyl sulfide Bulletin of the Ckemcal Society of Japan , 45, pp. 536539 1971 . The present invention is directed to an improved process for making a specific class of alkyl aryl viz., alkyl aminoaryl sulfides, or as designated herein thioalkyl aniline compounds, and especially thioalkyl ntroaniline products. In one form the present invention comprises the production of thioalkyl aniline compounds by the reaction of a thiocyano aniline and an alcohol in the presence of an alkali metal cyanide and a dipolar aprotic solvent improved in that an alkyl halide reactant is also provided.Another form of the invention comprises the production of the desired thioalkyl aniline compound products by reacting a thiocyano aniline with an alcohol and an alkyl halide in the presence of an alkali metal cyanide, a water immiscible solvent, and a phase transfer catalyst. In a further improved variation of this form, the invention is further characterized in that the phase transfer catalyst is a polymer bound phase transfer catalyst. The thioalkyl aniline compounds produced by the process of this invention can employ an alkyl group having from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms. Preferably, only carbon and hydrogen are present in the structure of the alkyl group. Accordingly, groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl and isobutyl groups can be used in the thioalkyl aniline compounds of the present invention. Additionally, the aromatic ring of such thioalkyl aniline compounds can have such substituents as halo, nitro, amino and similar functional groups substituted on the benzene ring nucleus in the 2, 3, 5 or 6 position, positions 1 and 4 being reserved for the amino and thio groups, respectively. Therefore, the compounds produced by the process of this invention can be 4 thiomethyl 2 nitroaniline, 4 thioethyl 2 nitroaniline, 4 thiopropyl 2 nitroaniline, 4 thiobutyl 2 nitroaniline, 4 thiopropyl 3 nitroaniline, 4 thioethyl 3 chloroaniline, 4 thiobutyl 5 nitroaniline, 4 thiomethyl 6 nitroaniline, 4 thioethyl 2 bromoaniline, 4 thiopropyl 3 aminoaniline, and the like. Of course, as indicated hereinabove, other groups which are innocuous to the cyanide displacement can be substituted for the nitro group in the same or different positions. Most preferred of the compounds produced by the present process is 4 thiopropyl 2 nitroaniline because of its use as an intermediate in the synthesis of effective anthelmintics. The above compounds are prepared by reaction of 4 thiocyano aniline compounds which are known intermediates for antibacterial compounds with an alcohol or other source of alkyl groups suitable for the formation of compounds of this invention in the presence of an equivalent of an alkali metal cyanide. In the present invention, the alcohol employed is one source of alkyl groups in the thioalkyl or aniline compounds produced by the present process. Thus, methanol, ethanol, n propanol, isopropanol, n butanol and the like may be used. As another source or alkyl groups,areusedthe alkyl halides. For example, alkyl chloride and alkyl bromide, such as methyl chloride, ethyl bromide, n propyl chloride, n propyl bromide, n propyl iodide, n butyl chloride, n butyl bromide, and the like are useful. Any of the halides can be employed so long as no substantially adverse reaction with starting materials, intermediates or product is evidenced although propyl bromide and propyl chloride are preferred because of good results and low cost Most efficacious has been the combination of alcohol and alkyl halide.Any of the foregoing alcohols and alkyl halides can be used in about any relative amount. However, best results have been achieved when about molar equivalent quantities are employed. Most preferably, there is employed n propanol with n propyl bromide. Most highly preferred is the use of propanol and propyl bromide in molar equivalent ratios. It has also been found that a dipolar aprotic solvent is effective to facilitate dissolution of the alkali metal cyanide into the reaction mixture. Many such solvents are known and commercially available. As examples, there may be mentioned dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl formamide, hexamethyl phosphoramide, etc. Any of these which does not interfere with the reaction and easily accomplishes dissolution of the alkali metal cyanide into the reaction mixture can be used. Although dipolar aprotic solvents provide advantageous process results, they suffer from the disadvantages of being expensive, high boiling and water soluble which makes product recovery and solvent recycle difficult.Therefore, an alternative process of this invention includes a process for preparing a thioalkyl aniline by reacting a thiocyano aniline with an alcohol and an alkyl halide in the presence of an aqueous alkali metal cyanide, a water immiscible solvent and a phase transfer catalyst.Catalysts useful in the process of the present invention are, in general, any compound having the general formula R 4MX which provides the reaction system the ion where M is a Group V A element of Periodic Chart of theElements, Fisher Scientific Company, Chicago, Illinois, 1955 nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth one, two or three of the R groups are lower alkyl having from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms, benzyl or phenyl, or monolower alkyl substituted benzyl or phenyl each of the R groups is alkyl having from 2 to about 20 carbon atoms, benzyl or phenyl and wherein X is a chlorine, iodine or bromine atom or a hydroxy or bisulfate group.Preferred R 4MX compounds are those wherein the total number of carbon atoms in the R 4 portion are from about 10 to about 30, preferably from about 12 to about 20, or from about 12 to about 16, especially those wherein the R groups are acyclic groups. Preferred compounds are the ammonium or phosphonium compounds. Suitable phenyl groups are unsubstituted or substituted with compatible substituents which do not react adversely in the system. Preferably, the substitution on the phenyl groups is limited to that containing only hydrogen and carbon atoms such as lower alkyl groups having from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms, particularly methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl groups. Typical catalyst compounds include tributyl methyl ammonium chloride 13 carbon atoms in the R 4 portion , tributyl methyl phosphonium chloride, tributyl methyl ammonium iodide, tributyl methyl phosphonium bromide, tributyl methyl ammonium hydroxide, tributyl ethyl ammonium iodide 14 carbon atoms in the R 4 portion , tributyl ethyl ammonium bromide, tributyl ethyl ammonium chloride, tributyl methyl arsenic chloride, tributyl methyl antimony chloride, tributyl methyl bismuth chloride, dodecyltrimethyl ammonium chloride, didecyldimethyl ammonium chloride, tetraphenyl ammonium chloride and the like.Other suitable catalysts are tripropyl butyl ammonium chloride, tripropyl butyl ammonium bromide, tripropyl butyl ammonium iodide and the like. Other suitable catalysts are tripropyl pentyl ammonium chloride, tripropyl pentyl ammonium bromide, tripropyl pentyl ammonium iodide and the like. Other suitable catalysts are tripropyl hexyl ammonium chloride, tripropyl hexyl ammonium bromide, tripropyl phenyl ammonium chloride, dipropyl methyl ethyl ammonium chloride, dimethyl ethyl phenyl ammonium chloride, tripropyl phenyl ammonium iodide, tributyltetradecyl phosphonium bromide Bu3C14H29PBr and the like. The phase transfer catalyst provides reaction at the interface between reactants in the aqueous phase and the organic phase. The organic phase may be provided in a water immiscible solvent. For reactions of this type it has been found that a halohydrocarhon solvent provides good water immiscibility, substantial inertness to reactants and products and good stability at reaction temperatures.Preferred halohydrocarbon solvents have a boiling point greater than about 200 C at atmospheric pressure to provide good agitation during reaction, such as by refluxing.Typical of such water immiscible solvents are methylene chloride, chloroform, chlorobenzene, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, and the like. Most preferred is methylene chloride because of its availability and utility. In another aspect of the process of this invention, it has been found that recovery of the catalyst, recycle to subsequent reactions and easily handled product solutions are advantageously obtained when the phase transfer catalyst is immobilized or bound to a solid substrate, such as a polymer which is not dissolved in either the aqueous or organic phase. Such a most highly preferred catalyst while maintaining yields equivalent to soluble phase transfer catalysts, do not become inactivated.when chemically attached to the polymer substrate, are not lost during separation of the phases and are easily recovered for clean up and recycle. For convenience, such catalysts will be referred to as polymer bound phase transfer catalysts.The polymer portion of polymer bound phase transfer catalyst is the organophilic portion and provides a solid substrate upon which the hydrophilic active portion of the polymer bound phase transfer catalyst is attached. Any polymer, including copolymers, ternary polyaers and the like can be employed providing they have the porosity, handling ability, physical integrity during reaction to form the phase transfer catalyst and chemical properties.Preferably, it has been found that a ch lormethylstyrene divinyl benzene copolymer, cqmmercially available fromBio Rad Laboratories, Richmond, Cslifofniatundet the tradename Chloromethyl Biobeads provides a suitable substrate for the preparation of the polyter bound phase transfer catalyst used in the process of this invention,The above mentioned copolymer is reacted with, among others, a tertiary amine to form the polymer bound phase transfer catalyst. Such tertiary amines, as are suitable in the formation of the quaternary salt catalysts of formula R 4MX described hereinabove, are useful for the preparation of the polymer bound phase transfer catalyst.For example, tertiary alkyl amines having from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms in one or more of the alkyl groups, or benzyl phenyl groups in the tertiary amine are useful. Preferably, each alkyl group has from 1 to about 12 carbon atoms and, more preferably, from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms in each alkyl group. Typical examples are trimethyl amine, triethyl amine, tripropyl amine, tributyl amfne and the like, all as hereinbefore mentioned with respect to the quaternary salt catalyst. Preferred examples of such amines areN,N dimethyl n butyl amine and tri n butyl amine, The polymer bound phase transfer catalysts useful in this invention can be prepared according to the method ofRegen, J. Org. Chem., Vol. 42, No. S, 1977, pp. 875 879. The polymer bound phase transfer catalyst used in the process of this invention was prepared by soaking the Chloromethyl Biobeads in tetrahydrofuran until swollen.Then, a 50 to 100 percent molar excess of the N,N dimethyln butylamine was added and the reaction tnixture was refluxed for 12 hours. The solids were filtered off, washed and dried overnight. The polymer bound phase transfer catalyst was then ready for use as shown in Example 10. The amount of catalyst used is, in general, an effective amount to achieve at least some catalytic effect however, in general, one does not use more catalyst than is necessary to achieve a reasonable reaction rate since such usually involves the monopolization of reactor volume, needless expense and the like. In general, the amount of catalyst used ranges from about 0.1 to about 10 mol percent based on the 4 thiocyano 2 nitroaniline reactant with from about 1 to about 5 percent being preferred. Preferred catalysts contain a total of from about 12 to about 16 carbon atoms total in the R groups, especially those in which all R groups are not the same, since several such catalysts have an excellent relationship between the solubilities thereof in the reaction system as well as in water wash systems useful to remove catalyst residue from the product.Other criteria considered in the selection of catalysts include initial cost and ease of preparation. Outstanding catalysts are tetrabutyl ammonium bromide and tributyl methyl ammonium chloride, since they are readily prepared by a comparatively easy process known conventionally to one skilled in the art. In each type of reaction alternatively described hereinabove, an alkali metal cyanide is employed. Preferably, the alkali metal cyanide is sodium or potassium cyanide. In the reactions employing a dipolar aprotic solvent the alkali metal cyanide is used per se, but when a phase transfer catalyst is employed the alkali metal cyanide may be an aqueous alkali metal cyanide. The process for preparing the intermediates can be best illustrated by reference to a specific example. Since 4 thiopropyl 2 nitroaniline is typical of such intermediates, it will be used to illustrate the process for preparation of such useful compounds in the following examples. EXAMPLE 1 A 0.40 g portion of powdered sodium cyanide was dissolved in a solution of 2.93 g of n propanol and 8 ml of dimethylsulfoxide. Then, to the reactor was added 1.56 g of 4 thiocyano 2 nitroaniline and the reaction mass was stirred at room temperature. Another 0.4 g of powdered sodium cyanide was added after 105 minutes and dissolved into the reaction mass. Then, 145 minutes after the start of the reaction, 5 ml of propyl bromide was added to the reaction mixture which became thick and formed a porous solid so that the agitator blade was prevented from stirring. An additional 10 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide solvent was added.Workup of the reaction mixture by adding methylene chloride and extracting three times with water, followed by drying over sodium sulfate, showed the yield to be 98.6 of desired 4 thiopropyl 2nitroaniline as determined by vapor phase chromatograph with internal standard.EXAMPLE 2 Following the procedure of Example 1, except that propyl chloride and dimethyl formamide are used in place of propyl bromide and dimethyl sulfoxide, There was added 0.62 g of propanol, 0.81 g of propyl chloride and 0.122 g of biphenyl as an internal standard in dimethyl formamide. A 0.26 g portion of solid sodium cyanide was added to the solution and then I g of 4 thiocyano 2 nitroaniline was added to the reaction mixture which was stirred at room temperature. After 45 minutes, a sample analyzed by vapor phase chromatography showed 58 yield of 4 thiopropyl 2 nitroaniline. A yield of 67 4 thiopropyl 2 nitroaniline was obtained in a sample analyzed by vapor phase chromatography after 1 hour and 15 minutes.Then, an additional 1.21 g of propyl chloride was added to the reaction mixtrue to hasten reaction. One hour later, a 71 yield of 4 thiopropyl 2 nitroaniline was determined by vapor phase chromatography. EXAMPLE 3 A 0.30 g portion of powdered sodium cyanide was dissolved in a solution of 1.85 g of n propanol in 10 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide. A 0.119 g portion of biphenyl was added as an internal standard to follow the reaction progress. Then1 4 thiocyano 2 nitroaniline in the amount of 1 g was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature. After 15 minutes from completion of the addition, the yield of 4 thiopropyl 2 nitroaniiine was 27 . After one hour the yield was 31 . Since product formation had nearly stopped, 3.78 g of n propyl bromide was added to the reaction mixture. Forty five minutes later the yield of 4 thiopropyl 2 nitraniline was 75 . EXAMPLE 4 A 1 g portion of 4 thiocyano 2 nitroaniline, 0.16 of of tetrabutyl ammonium bromide as a catalyst, 0.117 g of biphenyl, 1.86 g of n propanol, and 3.79 g of n propyl bromide were dissolved in 10 ml of refluxing methylene chloride. To the refluxing reaction mixture was then added a 1.56 g portion of sodium cyanide as 6.16 g of a 25 aqueous solution. The reaction mixture was refluxed using a 500 C oil bath and moderate agitation. The reaction mixture turns a burgundy red after one or two minutes. The following time yield relationship was observed by taking samples and analyzing by vapor phase chromatography. Time 4 Thiopropyl 2 nitroaniline Min. Yield 30 59 105 85 150 92 215 93 The reaction was stopped and the layers separated without emulsions. The organic layer was dried and the solvent evaporated on a rotary evaporator to obtain the crude product. EXAMPLE 5 The procedure of Example 4 was followed except that n propyl bromide was replaced by 2.42 g of n propyl chloride and 0.102 g of biphenyl were employed as the internal standard. After addition of all the reagents in the same amounts as Example 4, with the exceptions noted above, the reaction mixture forms an orange precipitate. After 1 hour and 15 minutes, the yield of product 4 thiopropyl 2nitroaniline is 18 . After 160 minutes, the yield of 4 thiopropyl 2 nitroaniline is only 20 . A solid was separated from the reaction mixture and was not further characterized.EXAMPLE 6 A 1 g portion of 4 thiocyano 2 nitroaniline, 0.16 g of tetrabutyl ammonium bromide, 1.865 g of n propanol and 3.791 g of n propyl bromide was dissolved in 10 ml of refluxing methylene chloride. Then, 0.114 g of biphenyl was added as an internal standard to follow the reaction via vapor phase chromatograph. A 6 g portion of 25.3 aqueous sodium cyanide 1.51 g of sodium cyanide was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was refluxed on an oil bath at 500 C with moderate agitation. The yield of 4 thiopropyl 2 nitroanillne was followed during the course of the reaction and after 30 minutes the yield of 4 thiopropyl 2 nitroaniline was 68.4 . After 2 hours, the yield was 91.1 .The reaction was stopped after 3 hours and 10 minutes and the yield was 87.7 EXAMPLE 7 This example is similar to Example 6, except that 1 mole of the catalyst tetrabutyl ammonium bromide based on the starting 4 thiocyano 2 nitroaniline is employed. A 1 g portion of 4 thiocyano 2 nitroaniline, 0.016 g of tetrabutyl ammonium bromide, 1.86 g of n propanol, 0.114 g of biphenyl and 3.79 g of n propyl bromide were dissolved in 10 ml of refluxing methylene chloride. Then, 6 g of 25.3 aqueous sodium cyanide containing 1.51 g of sodium cyanide was added to the reactor.The reaction mixture was refluxed using a 500 C oil bath and moderate agitationThe reaction progress was followed on the vapor phase chromatograph with the following results Reaction Time After Addition 4 Thiopropyl 2 nitroaniline hrs. Yield 0.5 7 1.0 19 2.0 40 3.0 54 5.0 72 5.75 61Trouble was experienced with the vapor phase chromatograph columns. On changing the columns, the final yield of a sample of this experiment was 85 of 4 thiopropyl 2 nitroaniline.EXAMPLE 8 This experiment is similar to Example 6, except that 1 mole of methyl tributyl ammonium chloride catalyst based on 4 thiocyano 2 nitroaniline is employed. The reagents as in Example 7 wereused except that 0.131 g of biphenyl was added as an internal standard and 0.012 g of the methyl tributyl ammonium chloride was employed instead of the tetrabutyl ammonium bromide. Following the same procedure as in Example 7, the following readings were made by the vapor phase chromatograph with time Time 4 Thiopropyl 2 nitroaniline Hrs. Yield 1 24 2 42 4 64 5 72 6 77EXAMPLE 9 A 2 g portion of 4 thiocyano 2 nitroaniline, 0.16 g of a 75 wt aqueous solution of methyl tributyl ammonium chloride equivalent to 5 mol based on the 4 thiocyany2 nitroaniline , 3.72 n propanol and 7.58 g of n propyl bromide was dissolved in 20 ml of refluxing methylene chloride. A 12 g portion of 25.3 wt aqueous sodium cyanide 3.04 g of sodium cyanide was added. The reaction mixture was refluxed using 500 C oil bath and moderate agitation. The reaction was stopped after 4 hours and the phases were separated. High pressure liquid chromatographic HPLC analysis determined a yield of 97 of 4thiopropyl 2 nitroaniline. In a separate experiment under identical conditions, a 97 yield of 4 thiopropyl 2 nitroaniline was determined using the internal standard vapor phase chromatographic analysis method. The product can be purified by column chromatography and recrystallized from toluene hexane solvent mixture.The orange needles of 4 thiopropyl 2 nitroaniline melt at 36.5 38 C. Infrared and NMR analysis confirm the structure. Alternatively, the product can be purified so as to recycle the aqueous phase and recover unreacted n propanol, n propyl bromide and methylene chloride. this involves an initial phase separation followed by flash of the methylene chlroide and unreacted n propanol and n propyl bromide.EXAMPLE 10 A flask was charged with 1 0 g of 4 thiocyano 2 nitroaniline, 6.0 g of an aqueous solution containing 25 sodium cyanide, 10 ml of methylene chloride, 0.22 g of polymerbound phase transfer catalyst, prepared as described hereinabove, containing 1.19 meq. of quaternary nitrogens per gram of catalyst, 1.85 g of n propanol, 3.78 g of n propyl bromide, and 0.105 g of biphenyl as an internal standard.The stirred reaction mixture was placed in a 500 C oil bath for 6 hours. The catalyst was filtered and washed with methylene chloride . The methylene chloride layer was separated from the aqueous layer and analyzed by gas chromatography. The yield of 4 thiopropyl 2 nitroaniline was 89. The process is not limited to a tetrabutyl ammonium bromide, methyl tributyl ammonium chloride or polymerbound phase transfer catalyst. Any compound known for this type of activity can be used. Many phase transfer catalysts are effective, such as the ammonium or phosphonium salts known to skilled practitioners to be effective as phase transfer catalysts. Similarly, solvents other than methylene chloride can be used. Further, the reaction temperature can be varied. Additionally, reaction times can be decreased by running the above reaction in an appropriate pressure vessel at pressures greater than atmospheric pressure. Reaction times can also be increased or decreased, depending on catalyst concentration.
