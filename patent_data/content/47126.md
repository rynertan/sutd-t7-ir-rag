# Improved calcium sulphonate process.

## Abstract
In producing basic Calcium Sulphonate by carbonating mixtures of sulphonic acids, calcium hydroxide, alcohols and toluene the use of a narrowly defined temperature profile during carbonation enables product of improved oil solubil ity and viscosity to be obtained as well as leading to improved filterability.
