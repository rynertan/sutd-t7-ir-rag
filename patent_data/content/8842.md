# Burner for gaseous fuels of differing calorific values using preheated combustion air.

## Abstract
A multi fuel gas burner using preheated forced draft air, comprising a cylindrical inner burner tube 12 , supported by the wall of a furnace 34 and inserted into an opening in the wall, means 94, 95, 96 and 97 being provided to inject through the upstream end combustion air preheated to a selected temperature and compressed to a selected pressure. The downstream end of the inner burner tube is closed and a plurality of longitudinal slots 72 are circumferentially spaced in the wall of the tube at the closed end. Means 18 are provided to inject rich fuel gas up to 3,500 btu cu feet under selected pressure into the inner burner tube along its axis. An outer burner tube 22 axially surrounds the inner burner tube and forms an annular passage 49 therebetween. Means 28 are also provided to pass low pressure, lean, combustible gas of as low as 50 btu cu feet down the annular passage 49 and outwardly through a circumferential slot 56 at the end of the outer burner tube inside the furnace. The hot combustion air and rich gas flowing through the inner tube and radially outwardly and rearwardly through the plurality of slots, flow against the mix with the lean gas flowing outwardly through the circumferential slot, and burn against the surface 38 of a tile 36 , having a central opening, through which the burner is inserted into the furnace.
