# Ultra low flowrate liquid distributor system.

## Abstract
Liquid distributor for a packed column wherein a uniform liquid distribution pattern is obtained at ultra slow distributing flowrates. The distributor comprises 1 an array of spaced, enclosed, horizontal distributor tubes 20 capable of maintaining liquid to be distributed under pressure 2 horizontal transfer tubes 21 connecting the distributor tubes 3 vertical pipelets 24 of predetermined inside diameter and length inserted through the bottoms of the distributor tubes and extending above the bottom of tubes but not to the top of the tubes to avoid being stopped up by debris in the liquid and 4 a liquid feed means 28 . For feeds containing both liquid and vapor phases, a reservoir 18 is provided above the distributor so that the vapor phase of the feed entering the reservoir can escape the liquid phase leaving the liquid phase to flow down a conduit 22 into the distributor tubes, said conduit being of predetermined height above the tubes so as to provide liquid under constant pressure to the distributor tubes
