# A reversible unidirectional fluid flow pump.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a reversible unidirectional flow liquid pump. The pump includes a pumping assembly comprising a gerotor type of gear set 46, 50 , and has its inlet 66 68 in series fluid flow connection with a valve 70 adapted, upon reversal of the direction of pump rotation, to cause a hydraulic lock to be formed in the gear set whereby the pumping assembly is repositioned such as to ensure continued unidirectional liquid flow despite the reversal of rotation. The pump, which is particularly suitable for use as an oil pump in refrigerant compressors, does not rely upon friction in repositioning the pumping assembly.
