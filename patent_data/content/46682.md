# Single channel duplex communication system.

## Abstract
A single channel duplex transmitter receiver utilising digital FSK signals. An analogue to digital converter 2 frequency modulates a local oscillator 5 the output of which is coupled via a mixer combiner splitter network 6 to an aerial 7 . FSK signals received from the aerial are mixed with the local oscillator output in network 6 to provide quadra ture signals which are low pass filtered 8, 9 before being demodulated in a zero IF demodulator 10 to give a digital output. To avoid unwanted sidetone the output of the A D converter 2 is fed through a delay 12 to a digital network 11 where it is subtracted from the corresponding signals fed back through the demodulator 10 . The digital signals are then fed to a D A converter 13 .
