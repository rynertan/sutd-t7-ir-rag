## Abstract
The rear wheels 40 of a vehicle are turned in response to the turning of the front wheels 5 upon operation of the steering wheel 1 . A rack member in housing 7 is provided to be operatively connected with a movable member in housing 3 of the front wheel steering system 1a, 2, 3, 4a, b which is moved right and left in response to operation of the steering wheel 1 so that the rack member is moved together with the movable member. The rack member in housing 7 is in mesh with a pinion fixed to an end of an output shaft 8a whose rotation is transmitted to the rear wheel steering system 17, 18, 19 as steering force for moving it by way of a transmission shaft 10 .
