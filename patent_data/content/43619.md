# Backlash free shear joint.

## Abstract
Side plate members 22, 23 have a connecting clevis 24 at one end and portions 20, 21 which en circle and clear the hub 10 of a flanged hub member at the other end. Shear pins 28, 30 are mounted in holes provided in the flange 18 and side plates 22, 23 such that relative motion between the hub and clevis is prohibited. The side plate members are flexible along the axis of the pins to prevent galling or reseizing caused by the rough edges of fractured pins.
