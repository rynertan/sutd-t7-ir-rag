# Purification of hydrogen.

## Abstract
A moist hydrogen stream in which carbon oxides have been made innocuous by methanation over catalyst 18 is cooled to below dewpoint at 20 and depleted of water in separator 22 . It is dried in one of driers 28 and compressed at 32 . From compressor 32 a part stream is taken at 35 , heated at 40 and passed through a further, water loaded drier 28 to regenerate its charge. The resulting moist gas is recycled to the inlet of methanation catalyst 18 .
