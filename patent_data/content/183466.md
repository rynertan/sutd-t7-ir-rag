## Description
This invention relates to a process for the production of a dispersion of a water soluble polymer, which polymers are widely used, for example as flocculating agents for waste water treatment, dehydrating agents, chemicals for use in paper making processes, dispersion stabilizers for various suspensions, soil improvers and so on. Heretofore, as processes for the production of water soluble polymers used in such fields as those described above, there have been proposed, for example, stationary polymerization in an aqueous solution, water in oil type emulsion polymerization Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. 102388 1979 , and suspension polymerization in a hydrophobic solvent Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. 69196 1979 . Furthermore, Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. 70489 1975 discloses precipitation polymerization in an aqueous solution of a salt and Japanese Patent Publication No. 14907 1971 discloses polymerization in an aqueous solution mainly comprising acrylic acid a a low pH and containing a salt. In stationary polymerization in an aqueous solution, because the polymerization is conducted at a monomer concentration of 10 by weight or more in order to obtain a polymer of a high molecular weight, the product is in hydrated gel form and hence cannot be easily dissolved as such and therefore it is necessary either to dilute and sell the same as a flowable, low concentration product or to dry it to a powder. Where it is put on the market at a low concentration, the transport cost is increased, whereas the heat energy required for drying to a powder is great. Also, three dimensional crosslinking is brought about by heating and an undesirable water insoluble part is produced. The water in oil type emulsion is inflammable and also has the disadvantage that valuable organic solvents are wastefully consumed. With the suspension polymerization in a hydrophobic solvent, because inflammable substances such as cyclohexane and toluene are used, there is the disadvantage that an enormous cost is required for the production apparatus. Although precipitation polymerization in an aqueous salt solution is low in equipment cost and is a good process, it has the drawback that the polymer formed tends to stick together and grow into a mass, rendering handling very difficult. In the process described in Japanese Patent Publication No. 14907 1971, the dispersion is stable only under acidic conditions, and when the carboxyl groups are dissociated, it turns to a gel. However, since an anionic flocculating agent generally manifests its effect by dissociating the carboxyl groups and extending the polymer chain, the acidic flocculating agent does not manifest a satisfactory effect if not neutralized before use except in the case where it is used in an alkaline solution at a high pH. Furthermore, it is difficult using this process to produce a polymer flocculating agent having a degree of anionization of 15 mole or less which is most effective as a flocculating agent. FR A 2251367 discloses the production of a polymer dispersion by a process whereby a water soluble monomer is dissolved in an organic phase, which organic phase comprises a suspension of droplets in an aqueous salt solution. The salt is present in the aqueous phase to prevent the water soluble monomer from dissolving in the aqueous phase. The monomer is cross linked in the organic phase to produce a dispersion of microfine, substantially spherical, polymer beads in the aqueous phase. It is an object of the present invention to enable the provision of a process for the preparation of a water soluble polymer dispersion whereby the above disadvantages may be overcome or at least mitigated. This invention accordingly provides a method of obtaining a dispersion of a water soluble polymer by dissolving a monomer in an aqueous salt solution and conducting polymerization while depositing the polymer as fine particles in the presence of a dispersant. The aqueous salt solution is required to dissolve the monomer and precipitate the polymer. As the dispersant, a polymer electrolyte soluble in an aqueous salt solution is effective. Where the deposited polymer is an anionic or cationic polymer electrolyte, the polymer electrolyte used as the dispersant is required to have charges of the same kind as the deposited polymer. The amount of the dispersant used should be 0.1 by weight or more based on the aqueous salt solution. The polymer dispersion obtained is of low viscosity and has good flowability, and thus is convenient for transport by pumping or dissolution. Since no organic solvent us used, there is no risk of inflammability and also the cost is low. The invention relates in a preferred aspect to a process for the production of an easily flowable water soluble polymer dispersion which comprises polymerizing an acrylic water soluble monomer A while depositing the polymer with stirring in an aqueous salt solution, in the presence of a dispersant B . The acrylic water soluble monomer employed in the present invention is at least one water soluble monomer A of the general formula I , While one or a combination of two or more of the above described monomers may be selected, since the polymerization is conducted while depositing the polymer, there is one requisite that the formed polymer of the monomer A not be soluble in the aqueous salt solution. As regards the cationic monomers of the formula I , a highly hydrophobic benzyl group is attached to the amino group, and, as a result, the monomers of the formula I do not dissolve in the aqueous salt solution even in homopolymerization and may be used at proportions in a wide range. Further, since this invention relates to a process for the production of a water soluble polymer, as long as the polymer of the water soluble monomer A is water soluble, the combination of the monomers is not restricted to those described above. For example, a monomer having solubility in water to some degree such as acrylonitrile etc. may also be used as long as the copolymer with the water soluble monomer A is water soluble. There is a requirement that the aqueous salt solution which is a dispersion medium for the polymerization should not dissolve the polymerization product. Representative salts include sodium sulfate, ammonium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, aluminium sulfate, While the concentration of the aqueous salt solution is not particularly restricted and varies depending on the molar ratio of the ionic monomers and the salt used, the range of from 15 by weight to the upper limit of solubility is generally preferred. Further, it is also possible to reduce the viscosity of the dispersion by further adding the salt in the range of solubility to the dispersion after polymerization. The amount of the dispersant used is preferably 0,1 by weight or more based on the aqueous salt solution, and with less than 0.1 , the formed polymer cannot be obtained in a dispersed form and sticks to each other to grow into a bigger mass, and thus it is not preferred. The polymer electrolyte to be present as the dispersant on polymerization is not particularly restricted as long as it is soluble in the aqueous salt solution used for polymerization. Where the formed polymer is cationic, then a cationic polymer electrolyte is preferred. The anionic polymer electrolyte is preferably a polymer of an acrylic acid alkali metal salt, a 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid alkali metal salt, or a copolymer containing at least 30 mole thereof, and the cationic polymer electrolyte is preferably a polymer of one or more cationic monomers of the following formula III or a copolymer containing 20 mole or more thereof While representative examples of the cationic monomers of the formula III include dimethylaminoethyl meth acrylate, dimethylaminopropyl meth acrylate, dimethylaminohydropropyl meth acrylate and those obtained by quaternizing those with methyl chloride, dimethylsulfuric acid etc., monomers satisfying the formula III may all be used. The polymerizing method is outlined below, and more detail will be later described in the examples. A predetermined acrylic water soluble monomer A is charged into an aqueous salt solution in which a dispersant has been already dissolved, oxygen is displaced by nitrogen gas, then a polymerization initiator Is added, and the polymerization is started with stirring. When the polymerization reaches completion, polymer particles of a particle diameter of 1mm or less may be obtained In a dispersed form. The monomer concentration at that time Is In the range of 5 parts by weight or more based on 100 parts by weight of the aqueous salt solution, and If it is less than 5 parts by weight, there is no superiority to aqueous solution polymerization. On the other hand, the upper limit is where the flowablity of the product is lost. The polymerization temperature varies depending on the kind of polymerization initiator and is not particularly restricted as long as the initiator functions well. Further, the polymerization initiator is not particularly restricted, and, for example, the conventionally employed redox type, azo type etc. may be used. This invention is more particularly described by the following examples, but it should be unerstood that this invention is not limited to these examples.
