# Method for feeding chemicals into a system.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a system characterized by a main line carrying a first fluid therethrough, control means and means for selectively introducing a second fluid into said main line, there being a shunt line of a substantially lower flow rate than said main line and arranged to receive a reference fluid therethrough, said reference fluid having known characteristics, said shunt line including injection means for introducing said second fluid therein and for uniformly mixing said second fluid with the fluid flowing through said shunt line, said shunt line including first sensing means located upstream of said injection means for measuring a steady state parameter of the fluid flowing thereby and second sensing means located downstream of said injecting means for measuring said steady state parameter of the fluid flowing thereby, said control means being coupled to said injecting means for controlling the introduction of said second fluid into said shunt line in response to said sensed parameters. There is also provided a method of accurately mixing a predetermined amount of one fluid with another fluid, characterised in that said other fluid flows through a main line, there being provided a second line in shunt with said main line, said second line being arranged to be selectively placed in fluid communication with said main line, said second line having a substantially lower flow rate than said main line, providing a first reference fluid having known characteristics through said shunt line and measuring a predetermined parameter thereof, injecting said one fluid into said shunt line so that said fluids are homogenously mixed, measuring a predetermined parameter of said homogenous mixture and calculating when said predetermined amount of said one fluid has been injected in response to said sensed parameters, and stopping said injection at that time.
