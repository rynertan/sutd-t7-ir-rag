## Description
POLYMER HAVING ISOTHIANAPHTKENE STRUCTURE AND ELECEFROCHROMIC DISPLAY With the latest remarkable developments in lighter. ng, thinning ov miniaturization of electric and electronic instruments, not only lightening, thinning or miniaturization of various conductive materials used therein but also new development of these materials per se have been desired. Various sulfur containing heterocyclic polymers are known including polymers from thiophene, U.S. Patent No. 2,552,796 and U.S. Patent No. 2,658,902 polymers from dibenzothiophee, U.S. Patent No. 3,585,163 polymers from vinyl bithiophene,U.S. Patent No. 3,615,384 polymers from various substituted thiophenes, U.S. Patent No. 3,725,362 polymers from 2 bromc 8 hydroxyr5,5 dioxodibenzothiophene, U.S. Patent No. 3,775,368 and polymers from tetrathiapentalene, U.S. Patent No. 4,111,857. Within the rapidly expanding field of polymeric conductors Proceedings of the International Conference on the Physics and Chemistry of Polymeric Conductors , J. Physique. Colloque, 1983, C 3 , the poly heterocycles have received attention because they are easily prepared in film form and are considerably more stable to atmospheric exposure than poly acetylene or poly phenylene . For use in stabilizing a semiconductor surface, see R. Noufi et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 1981, Vol. 183, 184 and references therein. A further extension of this work is our recent entry into the study of poly thiophene . Extensive investigations on new conductive high polymers have been conducted. For example, polyacetylenes are under investigation for their possible availability as electrode materials of secondary batteries since they show excellent conductivities as high as 102 to 103 s cm by doping iodine or arsenic pentafluoride cf. SyntheticMetals, ob1 . 1, No. 2, 101 1979 1980 , and excellent charge discharge characteristics. Further, use of poly acetylenes as materials for solar batteries is also under investigation because of their light absorption characteristics close to those of sun light. However, the polyacetylenes are disadvantageous in that they are per se susceptible to oxidation and doped polyacetylenes are extremely sensitive to humidity. Polythiophenes are studied not orly as conductive materials or as battery electrode materials because of their specific electronic structure having a conjugated structure similar to that of cis form polyacetylenes and containing a sulfur atom, but also as electrochromic materials making use of color changes in a doped state. For example, A. M. Druy, et al reported that 2,2 bithienyl is electrochemically polymerized to form a polymer having a color which reversibly varies from blue in an oxidized state to red in a reduced state and such a polymer is useful as an electrochromic material making use of the reversibility of the color change cf.Journal de Physique, Vol. 44, No. 6, C3 595 1983 . In the light of the above described problems, the present inventors have conducted extensive investiga tios and, as a result, found that a polymer having an isothianaphthene structure is a very stable compound even in air and capable of reversibly varying its color in the course of oxidation or reduction in such a stable manner as sufficient to allow repeated use thereof and it is a novel polymer that can easily show conductivities higher than 10 2 s cm upon doping general dopants and, thus accomplished the present invention. According to the present invention, we have now synthesized poly isothIanaphthene , a polymer of a nonclassical thiophene M.. P. Cava et al., Acc. Chem. Res., 1975, Vol. 8, 139 . While not bound by any theory, we believe that poly isothianaphthene exhibits higher stability and perhaps conductivity than poly thiophene because the resonance contributors lc and Id shown in Figure 1 are important in the stabilization of open shell species lc and delocalization along the backbone ld is responsible for high electrical conductivity. EMI4.1 Figure 1 The analogous resonance structure particularly the analog of Id would not be expected to be as important contributors to the electronic structure of poly thiophene as they are in the case of poly isothianaphthene because of the overwhelming gain in stability resulting from incorporation of the 3,4 bond of thiophene into a benzene ring. In the case of the preparation of poly thiophene , the two simplest methods are anodic polymerization of pure thiophene A. Diaz, Chem. Scripta, 1981, Vol. 17, 145 G. Tourillon et al., J. Electroanal.

Colloquy, 1983,Vol. C 3, 595 and the electrolysis is carried out at relatively low applied voltages 3.5 V . From a practical point of view, the anodic polymerization is the more desirable it is simple and the product appears in the form of a relatively tough, blue black film. The chemically coupled product is of more academic interest since it is crystalline and its nurberaverage molecular weight is known but it is invariably produced in powder form. We have found that the most desirable approach to poly isothianaphthene is through the electrochemical coupling of isothianaphthene. Monomer prepared according to J. A. Gadysz et al., Tetrahedron, 1979, Vol. 35, 2239 11. P. Cava et al., J. Amber. Chem. Soc., 1959, Vol. 81, 4266 M. P. Cava et al., J. Orc. Chem., 1971, Vol. 36, 3932. In this patent, we present procedures electrochemical and chemical for the preparation of poly isothianaphthene .As will be shown below, electrochemical polymerization to yield the desired unsaturated polymer is possible only under rather specific conditions. As is well known, liquid crystal display devices have recently been developed as display devices requiring low energy and been widely used in various applications.However, liquid crystal devices have a problem of dependence on a visual angle and also are disadvantageous in that the display is poor in sharpness no memory function is provided display cannot be obtained over a large surface area 6ndfe like. In order to eliminate these disadvantages, studies have extensively been conducted onECD devices of low energy type making use of the so called electrochromism in which light absorption characteristics vary due to application of voltage or electric current. Electrochrornic materials which can be used in the ECD advices are classified into inorganic materials and organic materials. The inorganic materials that are considered usable mainly include oxides of transition metals, a specific example is wolfram oxide, but they are limited in developable colors and also cause electrochemical elution of the membrane or deterioration of electrodes when protons are used as color forming ions, although their response speeds are high. On the other hand, the organic materials include viologen dyes, phthalo cyanine complexes, etc. However, the viologen dyes are disadvantageous in that repeated use thereof results in precipitation of insoluble substances, and the phthalo cyanine complexes have a pending problem of adhesiveness between a vacuum evaporated membrane and a base plate. In addition, electrochromic materials which have recently been proposed include polyanilines as disclosed in A.F. Diaz, et al., Journal of Electro AnalvticalChemistry, Vol. 111, 111 1980 or Yoneyama, et al., ibid., Vol. 161, 419 1984 polypyrroles as disclosed in AF. Diaz, et al., ibid., Vol. 101 1983 and polythiophenes as disclosed in M.A. Druy, et al., Journal de P sicue, Vol. 44, June, page C3 595 1983 or Kaneto et al., Japan Journal of Applied Phvsics, Vol. 23, No. 7, page L412 1983 , but none of them has not yet been put into practical use. In particular, electrochro ric materials are required to exhibit rapid response, provide high contrast, consume low power, develop excellent color tones and the like.Furthermore, an electrochromic material capable of developing a colorless tone will greatly contribute to broadening the utility of the device.However, any of these hetero conjugated type high molecular weight materials are colored in the course of conversion from an oxidized state into a reduced state. Methods for increasing contrast by, for example, employing a white background plate, have been attacked but still not reached completion. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Briefly, the present invention comprises a polymer having an isothianaphthene structure represented by the formula Ia and or Ib EMI8.1 wherein R1 and R2 each represents a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon residue having 1 to 5 carbon atoms such as methyl, methoxy and thiomethyl, with the proviso that R1 and R2 may link together to form, along with the benzene ring, a fused ring which is naphthalene X is sulfur, selenium or tellurium Y represents an anion of an electrolyte z represents a number from 0.01 to 1 showing a ratio of the anion per mol of a monomer and n represents a number of from 5 to 500 showing a degree of polymerization. An electrochromic display wherein a high molecular weight conductive membrane formed on a conductive transparent base is used as a display base and an opposing electrode is arranged thereunder via a liquid electrolyte, which is characterized in that said high molecular weight conductive membrane is a polymer having an isothianaphthene structure and capable of being reversibly oxidized or reduced. The above described polymer can be used in the electric and electronic fields as electrodes or electrochromic display elements, or for the production of solar batteries, electric splicing, fixing and conversion devices of electromagnetic wires, or as reversible oxidationreduction systems. The polymers according to the present invention can easily be synthesized by various polymerization methods. Poly isothianaphthene and related polymers are preparec by several different approaches. Electrochemical polymerizatior of isothianaphthene is strongly electrolyte dependent. Nuclecphilic anions Br , C1 allow formation of poly isothianaphthene . The latter, either in a Bronsted acid S04nH20 doped for or chloride doped form is a better conductor than polythiophene by ca. one order of magnitude. For example, 1, 3 dihydroisothianaphthene 2 oxide or a derivative thereof represented by the fcrmula IIa EMI9.1 is reacted in a solvent having a dehydrating and oxidizing effect, such as concentrated sulfuric acid, to form the desired polymer. Further, the desired polymer can also be obtained by subjecting isothianaphthene or a derivative thereof represented by the formula lib EMI10.1 which is obtainable, for example, by dehydration and sublimation of the compound represented by the formula Ila on alumina, to i electrochemical polymerization in an aprotic solvent in the presence of an electrolyte ii cationic polymerization in the presence or absence of a solvent, followed by reacting the resulting dihydro type polymer with an oxidizing agent for dehydrogenation iii oxidative polymerization or a like method. Solvents which can be used in the abovedescribed polyerization of monomers are not particularly restricted and can properly be selected according to the method of polymerization. In general, in the case when the isothianaphthene or its derivative represented by the formula lib is electrochemically polymerized in the presence of an electrolyte, aprotic solvents, such as acetonitrile, benzonitrile, propionitrile, dioxane, tetra hydrofuran, sulforan, propylene carbonate, etc., can be used.In the case when isothianaphthene or its derivative of the formula lib is cationically polymerized, solvents usable include dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane, tetrafluoroethane, nitromethane, nitroethane, nitrobenzene, carbon disulfide, etc. In the case when te dihydroisothianaphthene 2 oxide or its derivative of the formula IIa is dehydration polymerization, solvents such as concentrated sulfuric acid and poly phosphoric acic can be used.Further, when the isothianaphthene or its derivatIve of the formula IIb is subjected to oxidative addition polymerization, a combination of the solvents used in the cationic polymerization and Friedel Crafts catalysts can be used. Polymerization temperatures which can be used in the abovedescribed polymerization of monomers can be determined according to the respective polymerization methods and are not particularly critical, but it is generally desirable to carry out the polymerization et temperatures ranging from 80 to 200 C. The polymerization time can be determined depending on the method and temperature of polymerization, the structure of monomers, etc., but it is usually preferable to conduct polymerization for a period of from 0.25 hours to 200 hours. The above described monomer compounds represented by the for mulae via and IIb can be synthesized according to known processes, for example, the processes described in XI.P. Cava, at al., Journal of American Chemical Society Vol. 81 4266 1959 and M.P. Cava, at al., Journal of Organic Chemistry, Vol. 36, No. 25, 3932 1971 . Further, in order to increase yields of 1,3dihydroisothianaphthene, a method of using solubilized lithium sulfide which can be obtained by reacting lithium triethyl borohydride with sulfur is proposed in J. A. Gradysz, et al., Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 35, 2329 1979 . The invention also includes the preparation of this novel polymer. It is an object of our invention to provide a novel polymer. It is a more particular object of this invention to provide a novel electrically conductive polymer. It is also an object of this invention to provide novel means for obtaining novel polyisothianaphthene type polymers. These and other objects and advantages of our invention will be aPparent from the more detailed description which follows.

Moreover, the poly isothianaphthene of this invention is a particularly interesting polymer1 for its transparency is not lost even in further oxidized state.Therefore, the polymers having an isothianaphthene structure according to the present invention are greatly useful in the electric and electronic industries, for example, as electrodes1 electrochroic display elements, solar batteries, electric splicing, fixing and conversion devices of electromagnetic wires as well as reversible o.xidation reduction systems. The present invention will now be illustrated in greater detail by way of examples, but it should be understood that these examples are not limiting the scope of the present invention. In the following examples, nuclear magnetic resonance spectra 1H NMR were measured by means of a spectrophotometer EM 360A manufactured by Varian Analytical Div. using TMS as an internal standard, and infrared absorption IR spectra were measured by means of a spectrophotometer of Model 281 manufactured by ThePerkin Elmer Corp. EXAMPLE I Preparation of Polyisothianaphthcne by Treating 1,3tahydroisothianaphthene 2 Oxide in Concd. Sulfuric Acid a Synthesis of 1,3 Dihydroisothianaphthene 2 Oxide To 200 ml of a solution containing 1 moi 1 of lithium triethyl borohydride was added 3.21 g 0.1 mol CT powderous sulfur placed in a Schlenk flask at room tr..perature under a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction . nediately took place, and the sulfur powder was dissolved to form a yellow suspension. This suspension came a pale yellow clear solution upon contact with a trace amount of air. Separately, into a 2 liter volume four necked flask equipped with a dropping funnel, a stirrer, a tmermometer and an inlet for introducing nitrogen were charged 26.4 g 0.1 mol of o xylylene dibromide and 1 utter of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran under a nitrogen atmipsphere to form a solution. While stirring, the above prepared tetrahydrofuran solution of lithium sulfide was aaded thereto dropwise at room temperature over a period c 1.5 hours. Thereafter, the tetrahydrofuran was reroved b distillation under reduced pressure and the residue was further distilled to obtain 10.9 g yield 80t of colorless 1,3 dihydroisothianaphthene having a boiling point of 74 76 C 3 mmHg.The IR spectrum of the product showed absorptions based on the phenyl group at 3060, 3326, 1582 and 1485 cm 1 absorption based on the methylene c oup at 2910, 2840 and 1450 cm 1 absorption based on in plane deformation of 1,2 substituted phenyl at 1195 cm absorption of o substituted phenyl at 760 cm 1 and absorption of sulfide at 740 cm 1. The results of NMR spectrum 1H NMR measurement in CDCl3 with TMS as an internal standard are as follows 4.22 s, 4H 7.20 s, ZH This compound a as very imbile and changed fre yellow to black even when preserved under light screening and sealing. Then, the thus obtained 1 ,3 dihydroisothia naphthene was added to 450 ml of previously prepared 50 methanol aqueous solution having dissolved therein 18.6 g 0.086 mol of sodium metaiodate, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12 hours. The formed precipitate was separated by filtration. The filter cake was washed with 50 ml of methanol, and the washing and the filtrate were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure. The thus formed yellowish white solid was recrystallized from ethyl acetate cyclohexane to obtain slightly yellow tinged crystals having a melting point of 87 89 C. The resulting crystals were further recrystallized from ethyl acetate cyclohexane to obtain crystals having a melting point of 90 to 910C. The IR spectrum of the crystals showed strong absorption of sulfoxide at 1035 cm 1 in addition to the absorptions of isothia naphthene, and the absorption of sulfide at 740 cm disappeared. The H NNR spectrum measured in CDC13 with T,15 as an internal standard were as follows 4.65 s, 4H 7.20 s, 4H . Elementary Analysis for C 8H8 SO Calcd.

The mixture was allowed to stand at roo temperature for 70 hours, and the substantially solidified system was poured into 400 ml of methanol. The formed brown precipitate was separated by centrifugation, thoroughly washed with water and vacuum dried at 600C over night.The resulting polymer was placed in a So hlet s extractor and extracted successively with methylene chloride and chlorobenzene for 12 hours, respectively, to obtain 203 mg of a chlorobenzene insoluble matter. The IR spectrum of the resulting polymer were as shown in Figure 1. The results of the elementary analysis were C 67.26 H 3.12 and S 23.59 and in fairly agreement with calculated values C 67.19 H 3.32 S 23.54 on the assumption that the repeating unit had the following structure EMI19.1 The electric conductivity dot of the polymer at room temperature was measured by the use of a 4 terminal network conductivity measuring cell and was found to be 2 x 10 2 s cm. EXAMPLE II proparation of Polyisothianaphthene by Oxidation ofPolydihydroisothianaphthene Obtaine by Cat ionic Polymerization of Isothianaphthene with Oxidizing Agent a Synthesis of Isothianaphthene lIb, R1 R2 H Three hundreds milligrams 1.97 mmol of 1,3 dihydroisothianaphthene 2 oxide synthesized according toExample 1 a and 450 mg 4.41 mmol of neutral alumina were thoroughly pulverized and mixed in a mortar, then put in a sublimation apparatus and heated on an oil bath under reduced pressure. There was obtained 250 mg 1.87 mmol of isothianaphthene as white needle crystals at the bottom of a cooling part of the sublimation apparatus.Immediately thereafter, the resulting monomer was dissolved in 5 ml of purified and degassed methylene chloride, and 10 mg of trifluoroacetic acid was added thereto, followed by allowing the mixture to stand overnight. When the reaction mixture was poured into 50 ml of methanol, a white precipitate was obtained. The resulting polymer was soluble in chloroform, chlorobenzene, tetrahydrofuran and N,N dimethylformamide. The IR and spectra spectra of the polymer were as shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. Further, it was confirmed that the polymer had a molecular weight of 2000 as converted to polystyrene by gel permeation chromatography Varian 5000 of a tetrahydrofuran solution of the polymer. The electric conductivity RT of the polymer at room temperature as measured in the same manner as inExample 1 was 1 0 s cm or less. Elementary Analysis for C8H6S Calcd. E C 71.64 H 4.48 S 23.88 Found E C 71.27 H 4.54 S 23.96 The same procedures as described above were repeated except for using methanesulfonic acid as a polymerization initiator in place of trifluoroacetic acid to obtain a polymer. The IR spectrum of the resulting polymer were in complete agreement with that of Figure 2. These polymers were dissolved in 5 ml of chlorobenzene and tre ted with double the molar amount of chloranil to form a black precipitate. The resulting polymer had an electric conductivity aRT of 9 x 10 2 s cm at room temperature, and the electric conductivity of an iodine doped polymer was 9 x 10 1 s cm The IR spectra of the polymer is shown in Figure 4. The polymer after iodine doping did not undergo change of conductivity even when left to stand in air at room temperature fcr 1 week. In the same manner as described above except for using 5 ml of chloroform in place of chlorobenzene and 1,1 times the molar amount of N chlorosuccinimide in place of chloranil, a black polymer having entirely the same IR Spectrum as that shown in Figure 4 was obtained. The conductivity MART of this polymer was found to be 2.6 x, 10 1 s cm. EXAMPLE IIIPreparation of Polyisothianaphthene by One Step Oxidative Polvmerization of Isothianapthene Isothianaphthene was synthesized in the same manner as described in Example 2 a . A mixture of 250 mg of isothianaphthene, 5 ml of anhydrous methylene chloride, 134 mg of anhydrous aluminum chloride and 134 mg of anhydrous cupric chloride was allowed to react at a temperature of 35 to 370C for 1 hour to form a black precipitate. After the reaction mixture as such was maintained at that temperature for 12 hours, the precipitate was treated with a methanol solution having been rendered acidic with hydrochloric acid, thoroughly washed with water and dried. The dried polymer was extracted successively with hot methanol, hot methylene chloride and hot chlorobenzene to obtain 205 mg of a black polymer.The IR spectrum of this product was in complete agreement with Figure 4. The electric conductivity dRT was 2.8 x 10 2 s cm. EXA2 pLE IVPreparation of Polyisothianaphthene by Electrochemical Polymerization of Isothianat hthene F lectrocher ical polymerization of isothianaphthene was carried out by using an electrolytic solution prepared by dissolving an electrolyte indicated in Table 1 below and isothianaphthene in a polar solvent at a prescribed concentration a platinum plate as a sample electrode an aluminum plate as a counter electrode at room temperature at a constant voltage for a prescribed period of time. There was formed a polyisothianaphthene film on the platinum plate anode. The aforesaid electrolytic solution had been subjected in advance to disoxidation by bubbling dry argon gas therethrough for at least 30 minutes.The constant voltage during the polymerization was 1.5 V. The thus formed film was thoroughly washed successively with acetonitrile and methylene chloride and dried in vacuo. The electrical of the film properties were determined, and the results obtained are shown in Table 1 below.

The applied voltage sweep rate was 20 mV sec, and the range of sweep was from 1.0 V to 0.7 V vs. standard calomel electrode . The results obtained are shown in Figure 5. As is shown in Figure 5, the polymer showed an oxidation peak and a reduction peak at 0.58 V and 0.15 V, respectively, and had a color varying from deep blue at a voltage range of from 0.7.V to 0.6 V to etreely transparent light green at a voltage range of from 0.6 V to 1.0 V. These results indicate that the deep blue state is a neutral state of the polymer and that the polymer has a green color of high transparency in the oxidized and doped state.Test of Use as Battery The polyisothianaphthene film obtained inExample 4 1 was cut into pieces of 1 cm wide and 3 cm long. One end of the sample piecewas adhered to a platinum wire using a conductive adhesive, and this sample piece was arranged on each of both surfaces of a lithium foil of the snme size via a 1 mLm thick porous polypropylene partitioning membrane in such a manner that an electrolytic solution could sufficiently impregnated thereinto. The system was then dipped in a propylene carbonate solution containing 0.5 mol l of lithium perchlorate to a depth of 2 cm. The thus prepared battery wherein the poly isothianaphthene was used as a cathode and the lithium foil as an anode was charged at a charging current of 2.0 mA cm2 for 30 minutes in an argon atmosphere.Completion of charging was immediately followed by discharging at a discharging current of 2.0 mA cm2, and at the time when the voltage of the battery fell to 1 V, charging was again performed under the same conditions as described above. When the charge discharge operation was repeated in this manner, 590 times of repetition were recorded until the charge discharge efficiency was reduced to 50 . Further, the charge discharge efficiency on the 5th repetition was 99 . Furthermore, after 48 hour standing of a charged battery, the self discharging rate was 3.2.

Gladysz et al., Tetrahedron, 1979, Vol. 35, 2239 M. P. Cava et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 1959, Vol. 81, 4266 M. P. Cava et al., J. Org. Chem., 1971,Vol. 36, 3932 , and used directly after preparation. The polymer poly dihydroisothianaphthene was obtained by electrochemical oxidation of this monomer in a two electrode, separate compartment cell. Platinum sheet was used as the anode, and oxidized graphite was used as the cathode. The clear colorless solution used for the polymerization contained 0.23 M of isothianaphthene with 0.30 M electrolyte, Bu4NPF6, in acetonitrile. The acetonitrile Mallinckrodt was used directly without further purification.A series of 1.5 V batteries was used as the power supply. All experiments were carried out under dry N2. When 4.5 V was connected across this cell, a lot of white powder appeared near the anode instantly. The batteries were disconnected after ten minutes. This white powder, poly dihydroisothianaphthene , was separated by suction filtration, washed with acetonitrile and diethylether, and dried under vacuum. The resulting solid was purified for elemental analysis by reprecipitation from tetrahydrofuran H2O. observation was that poly isothianaphthene acts as an initiator of cationic polymerization of isothianaphthene. In order to test this hypothesis we exposed freshly prepared solutions of isothianaphthene to the usual catalysts for cationic initiation Bronsted and Lewis acids and found that all polymerized isothianaphthene to different degrees. But by far the most interesting result was with sulfuric acid in methylene chloride.Under these conditions, isothianaphthene was converted to a blue black powder form of poly isothianaphthene doped with hydrated sulfuric acid. Clearly the acid acted not only as catalyst but also as oxidizing agent. A reassuring convergent test for the above hypothesis was that the product of chloranyl dehydrogenation was poly dihydroisothianaphthene and the product of H2504 polymerization exhibited identical infrared spectra.The only reasonable explanation for this observation is that the infrared spectra of doped poly isothianaphthene are dominated by the absorptions due to the conduction electrons and the absorptions due to intramolecular vibrations are weak features of the spectrum. In the absence of additional control experiments, it is difficult to speculate about a specific mechanism to explain this electrolyte effect. We reased that H2SO4 may convert dihydroisothianaphthene S oxide directly into poly isothianaphthene . H2SO4 x H2O y. The addition of solid dihydroisothianaphtheneS oxide to 98 H2SO4 did in fact produce the desired partially doped poly isothianaphthene cf Scheme I, below . Scheme IEMI31.1 In addition, 7,7,8,8 tetracyanoquinodimethane can be used as a catalyst for cationic polymerization. However, the product did not exhibit higher conductivity than any of the other doped poly isothianaphthene compounds, indicating that the acceptor is probably not involved in the conductivity of the solid. Two reasons could be advanced for that observation, the acceptor molecules are probably not stacked in small crystalline regions and or there is complete charge transfer. While the above results explain the nature of the process of formation of poly dihydroisothianaphthene and allow the discovery of a clean procedure for the chemical synthesis of poly isothianaphthene , it still does not offer an entry to the electrochemical polymerization of isothianaphthene. This required the discovery of a method to prevent the catalysis for v dihydroisothianaphthene formation by nascent doped pol shianaphthene . We found that if the reaction medium a species which was more nucleophilic than isothiana pht mense, the propagation step would be interrupted. A test which involved addition of iodide to the anode compart means prior to electrolysis failed because iodide was simply oxi z ed under the electrolysis conditions.However, electrolysis wit I Br, Bu4NBr, or preferably Ph4AsCl produced excellent fiLf Dr. platinum or TOG. The only reasonable explanation for s observation is that the infrared spectra of doped poly irsothianaphthene are dominated by the absorptions due to tone conduction electrons and the absorptions due to intra mol ecular vibrations are weak features of the spectrum. In the abvsence of additional control experiments, it is difficult to speculate about a specific mechanism to explain this electrolyte efrt. A al . Calcd. for CgH6S C, 71.60 H, 4.51 S, 23.89 Found C, 71.27 H, 4.54 S, 23.96 LiBF4 and Bu4NClO4 can be used as the electrolyte for this reaction According to this invention, it has been found that the metastable isothianaphthene can be polymerized to well characterizable highly conducting polymers by at least three different procedures one of these involves the electrochemical preparation of poly dihydroisothianaphthene by the polymerization of isothianaphthene in the presence of nucleophilic anions.It has also been found that poly isothianaphthene is a better conductor than polythiophene. EXAMPLE VII Poly dihydroisotbianahthene By Chemical Cationic Polymerization The monomer isothianaphthene 396 mg, 2.96 m.mol was dissolved in 10 ml methylene chloride which was previously dried over P2Os. When one drop of methanesulfonic acid was added to this solution, there was an instantaneous change in the reaction mixture from colorless to red. This color became violet after 90 minutes. After removal of methylene chloride by evaporation, the residue was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran.And when this solution was poured into methanol, the polymer poly dihydroisothianaphthene precipitated from the solution.This was separated by centrifugation, and dried under vacuum.The infrared spectrum was identical with that of polymer poly dihydroisothianaphthene mentioned above. The following Examples demonstrate the successful practice of the present invention and are not intended to be limiting of the invention. EXAMPLE VIIIDoped Poly isothianaphthene By Electrochemical Polymerization The polymerization procedure was essentially the same as that described above in Example VI for the polymer poly dihydroisothianaphthene . The most important point was the electrolyte.When lithium bromide was used as the electrolyte, a blue film of the doped polymer poly isothianaphthene was grown on the anode conducting glass instantly after connecting a 1.5 V battery. Bu4NBr and Ph4AsCl can also be used as the electrolyte for this reaction. EXAMPLE IXDoped Poly isothianaphthene By Chemical Cationic OxidativePolymerization With Sulfuric Acid Sulfuric acid 5 ml. was added to the monomer isothianaphthene 396 mg. 2.96 m.mol . The monomer color changed from white to reddish black instantly. When the reaction mixture was poured into 400 ml of methanol after overnight stirring, a brown powder, the doped polymer poly isothianaphthene precipitated from this solution. This was separated by centrifugation and extracted with methylene chloride and chlorobenzene using a Soxhlet extraction apparatus, followed by drying under vacuum.This reaction can be also carried out with a suspension of sulfuric acid in methylene chloride. EXAMPLE XDoped Poly isothianaphthene By Chemical Cationic OxidativePolymerization With TCNQ 7,7,8 ,8 Tetracyanoguinodimethane The monomer isothianaphthene 238 ing. 1.77 m.mol was dissolved in 5 ml methylene chloride. After a few mg of TCNQ were added to this solution, its color changed to red very slowly. After overnight stirring, this color became bluish black.Next, more TCNQ which was double the molar quantity of the monomer isothianaphthene, was added to this solution. This was heated up to 1100C and this temperature was kept for 1 hour. When this reaction mixture was poured into methanol, greenish black powder precipitated from this solution. This was washed with methanol and chloro benzene using a Soxhlet extraction apparatus, followed by drying under vacuum. EXAMPLE XIPoly isothianaphthene From Poly dihydroisothianaphthene The polymer poly dihydroisothianaphthene , which was prepared by electrochemical polymerization, was dissolved in hot chlorobenzene. This was a light brown solution. Tetra chloro pbenzoquinone Chloranyl was added to this solution. Immediately the solution color changed to dark green. A powder precipitated from this solution by cooling. This was separated by suction filtration, washed with methanol, and dried under vacuum. All materials which were mentioned in Examples VII to XI showed identical infrared spectra. Thus, the present invention presents three alternative routes to poly isothianaphthene 1. The electrochemical polymerization of isothianaphthene in the presence of nucleophilic anions 2. The chemical polymerization of isothianaphthene or dihydroisothianaphthene S oxide in the presence of cationic polymerization catalysts 3. The dehydrogenation of poly dihydroisothianaphthene . Preliminary results of conductivity measurements are collected in Table II. The band edge of poly isothianaphthene was estimated from transmission through thin films at low doping levels to be ul eV 1.1 . This is nearly 1 eV lower than that of polythiophene 2eV, 62Onm 3.

The experiment of Figure 9 also demonstrates the electrochromic characteristics of the novel polymers of this invention.a 2 probe compaction measurement In Figure 6, we show the electrochromic effect the dopant was C104 . The reference electrode was lithium. The Energy eV refers to the incident radiation, with the 0 to 1 range being in the infrared, 1 to 2 the visible, and 2 and above gradually shifting to the ultraviolet portion of the spectrum. The results shown in Figure 6 furthermore indicate the utility of the polymers of this invention in solar energy conversion devices because the semiconductor energy gap is well matched to the solor spectrum. The present inventors have conducted extensive investigations on electrochromic behaviors of a polymer having an isothianaphthene structure and, as a result, found that the above described polymer is a novel electro chror,ic material which is rapid in response and provides a substantially colorless tone in an oxidized state, and thus accomplished the present invention. This finding is zEmi.tealy surprising because such an electro chrorric material that assumes a substantially colorless tone is not hitherto known. The electrochromic display device ECD according to the present invention comprises a conductive transparent base having provided thereon a high molecular weight conductive membrane and an opposing electrode arranged thereunder via a liquid electrolyte and is characterized in that said high molecular weight conductive membrane is a polymer having an isothianaphtene structure and capable of being reversibly oxidized or reduced. The term liquid electrolyte herein used means a dispersion or solution of a supporting electrolyte in a solvent.Specific Explanation of the Invention The high molecular weight conductive membrane which can be used as an electrochromic layer according to the present invention is a polymer capable of being reversibly oxidized or reduced and having an isothia nal,hthene structure represented by the formula III EMI39.1 wherein R1 and R2 represent hydrogen or hydrocarbon having a carbon number of 1 5, X is sulfur, selenium or tellurium, Y represents an anion, z is a value of 0 0.40 representing the ratio of anion per isothianaphthene structure unit, and n represents the degree of polymerization of 5 500, which is produced by electrochemically polymerizing isothianaphtene compound expressed by the following formula IV EMI39.2 wherein R1, R2 and X are as defined immediately above. Specific examples of the isothianaphthene compound represented by the formula IV include 1,3 isothianaphthene, 5 methyl 1 ,3 isothianaphthene, 5,6dimethylisothianaphthene, 5 ethyl 1 ,3 isothianaphthene, 5 methyl 6 ethyl 1,3 isothianaphthene, etc. Electrochemical polymerization of the abovedescribed isothianapthene compound can be carried out according to the methods generally employed for electrochemical pclyrrerization of thiophene, pyrrole, etc. e.g., the method described in Solid State Corunication, Vol. 46, No. 5, 389 1983 . More specifically, both controlled potential electrolysis or controlled current electrolysis can be employed, and it is desirable to form a polymer embrane on a transparent base by using a conductive transparent base as a sample electrode. The conductive transparent base which can be used in the present invention include the ones comprising a transparent insulator such as glass, polyester film, etc. having vacuum evaporated thereon indium tin oxide, tin oxide, platinum, etc. by sputtering or a like method, which are easily available as commercial products.The polymer membrance formed by electrochemical polymerization has a thickness of from 0.03 to 30 pm, preferably 0.05 to 22 ism, more preferably 0.1 to 10 Xm. The membrane thickness can be controlled by the quantity of electricity applied in the electrochemical polymerization, When the membrane thickness is less than 0.03 m, clear contrast cannot be attained, leading to substantial loss of cor.ercial value as a display material. To the contrary, a thickness exceeding 30 pm provides clear contrast but is unfavorable in view of film strength or response speed. ECD devices can be produced by assembling the thus obtained polymer with an opposing electrode via a liquid electrolyte. The liquid electrolyte which can be used is a dispersion or solution of a supporting electrolyte in a solvent. The supporting electrolyte which can be used in the present invention includes combinations of i anions i.e., tin the fomula III such as halide anions of Va group elements, e.g., PP6 t SbF6 , A.sF6 and SbCl6 halide anions of IIIa Group series element, e.g., EF4 halogen anions, e.g., I I3 , Br and C1 perchloric acid anions, e.g., ClO4 and ii cations such as alkali metal ions, e.g., Li , Na and K quaternary ammonium ions, e.g., Ps4N wherein R represents a hstdro carbon residue having 1 to 20 carbon atoms and phosphonium ions, e.g., C6H5 4P , but these combinations are not limitative.

These supporting electrolytes may be used individually or in combination cf two or more of them if necessary. EF2 anion can also be used in addition to the above enumerated anions. Further, cations which can be used in addition to the above enumerated ones include pyrylium or pyridinium cations represented by the following formula V and carbonium cations represented by the following formula VI or VII EMI42.1 wherein Z represents an oxygen atom or a nitrogen atom R represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 15 carbon atoms or an aryl group having 6 to 75 carbon atoms R represents a halogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms or an aryl group having 6 to 15 carbon atoms m is 0 when Z is an oxygen atom, or m is 1 whenZ is a nitrogen atom and p is O or an integer of from 1 to 5.EMI43.1 an R3, R4 and R5 each represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 15 carbon atoms, an allyl group, an aryl group having 6 to 15 carbon atoms or OR7 wherein R7 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms or an aryl group having 6 to 15 carbon atoms, with proviso that R, R4 and R5 are not hydrogen atoms at 6 the same time and R6 represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 15 carbon atoms or an aryl group having 6 to 15 carbon atoms. The HF2 anion which can be used is usually obtained by dissolving a compound hvdrofluoride represented by the formula VIII , IX or X R 4N HF2 VIII M HF2 IX EMI44.1 wherein R and R each represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 15 carbon atoms or an aryl group having 6 to 15 carbon atoms R represents an alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms or an aryl group having 6 to 15 carbon atoms Z represents an oxygen atom or a nitrogen atom q represents 0 or a positive integer of 5 or less and M represents an alkali metal, as a sQtorting electrolyte in an appropriate solvent.Specific examples of the co. ounds represented by the above forlae VIII , IX and X include H4N.HF2, Bu4N.HF2, Na.HF2, K.HF2, Li.HF2 andEMI44.2 The pyrylium or pyridinium cations represented by the formula III can be obtained by dissolving a salt formed between a cation represented by the formula V and an anion X , e.g., C104 , BF4 , AlCl4 , FeCl4, SnCl5 , PF6 , PCl6 , SbF6 , AsF6 , CF3SO3 , HF2 , etc., as a supporting electrolyte in an appropriate solvent.Specific examples of such a salt are EMI45.1 Specific examples of the carbonium cations represented by the above described formula VI or VII EMI45.2 These carbonium cations can be obtained by dissolving or dispersing a salt formed between such a cation and an anion X i.e., carbonium salt as a supporting electrolyte in an appropriate solvent.

Preferably, the organic solvents herein used are aprotic and have high dielectric constants. For example, ethers, ketones, nitriles, amines, amides, sulfur compounds, phosphoric ester compounds, phosphorous ester compounds, boric ester compounds, chlorinated hydrocarbons, esters, carbonates, nitro compounds and the like can be employed. Of these, ethers, ketones, nitriles, phosphoric ester compounds, phosphorous ester compounds, boric ester compounds, chlorinated hydrocarbons and carbonates are preferred. Specific examples of these solvents include tetrahydrofuran, 2 methyltetrahydrofuran, 1 ,4 dioxane, monoglyme acetonitrile, propionitrile, 4 methyl 2pentanone, butyronitrile, valeronitrile, benzonitrile, 1,2 dichloroethane, 7 butyrolactone, valerolactone, dimethoxyethane, methylformate, propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl thioformaride, ethyl phosphate, methyl phosphate, ethyl phospite, methyl phosphite, 3 methylsulforan, etc.Among these, nitriles and carbonates are especially preferred in order to increase the response speed. These organic solvents may be used alone or in cctination of two or more of them. Depending upon the model of ECD devices used or the kind of electrodes used, oxygen or water present in these solvents or protonic solvents sometimes deteriorate performances of the ECD devices. Such being the case, it is preferable to previously purify the solvents in a usual manner. Further, in the ECD devices of the present invention, organic solvents having merely dispersed there in a supporting electrolyte, or an organic solid electrolyte having high ionic conductivity which is composed of polyethylene oxide and Nal, a CN, etc. can also be used in addition to the above described electrolytes. Concentrations of the supporting electrolyte used in the ECD devices of this invention vary depending on the kind of organic solvents used, current and voltage values of applied electricity, operating temperatures, the kind of supporting electrolytes and the like and, there fore, cannot be generally fixed. The liquid electrolyte may be either homogeneous or heterogeneous, but usually employable concentrations range from 0.001 to 10 mol l.The cm stance between the high molecular weight conductive membrane and an opposing electrode cannot be generally deter ..ined since it varies depending on the kind of supporting electrolytes, current and voltage values of aptlied electricity, the display surface area as an ECD device and the like, but it is preferably from 0.05 to 5 mm.. Further, as an opposing electrode, a variety of materials can be er..loyed according to the end use.That is, in the case when transmitted light is utilized for displaying, the conductive transparent materials as described above are preferably used as opposing electrodes. On the other hand, in the case of utilizing reflected light, it is also possible to use, as opposing electrodes, opao e conductive rterials, such as a metal foil, e.g., nickel or platinum, and gauze. Furthermore, since theECD devices provide a substantially colorless tone, background plates having various color tones can be selected.Thus, the ECD devices obtained by the present invention can be used in a wide application owing to a wide selection of materials to be used. The present invention will now be illustrated in greater detail with reference to examples, but it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to these examples. EXAMPLE XII In an acetonitrile solution containing 0.08 mol l of C6H5 4 PC1 was dissolved 0.0788 mol l of 1,3isothianaphthene the compound of the formula IV wherein R1 R2 H to prepare an electrolyte. Electrochemical polymerization was carried out by using the above electrolyte, a glass plate on which indium tin oxide had been vacuum evaporated as a sample electrode, an aluminum plate as a counter electrode at a current density of 2 mA cm2 at room temperature for 20 minutes.There was obtained an electrochemically lightly doped, deep blue colored polymer on the indium tin oxide deposited glass plate anode. The resulting display base was washed with acetonitrile and dried. The dry thickness of the polymer membrane was 10 Vm. The thus produced display base was immersed in a tetrahydrofuran solution containing 0.53 mol l of LiC104, and electricity was imposed therethrough using Li as a counterelectrode to determine dependence on applied voltage. The results obtained are shown inFigure 6. As can be seen from Figure 6, the polymer had a blue color at 2.50 V vs. Li electrode but turned to transparent pale green at 3.50 V. It was also confirmed that this change was reversible. The, voltammetry as performed using C4H9 4. Ia ClO4 as an electrolyte in acetonitrile at an applied voltage of from 0.7 V to 1.0 V vs. a standard calomel electrode . The results obtained are shown in Figure 7. It can be seen from Figure 7 that the polymer film had a deep blue color at a voltage of from 0.6 V to 0.7 V and changed to a highly transparent pale green color at a voltage of from 0.6 to 1.0 V. According to these results, an ECD device as shown in Figure was produced, and a propylene carbonates solution containing 0.53 mol l of LiEF4 was incorporated therein as a liquid electrolyte and then sealed. Square waves of 0.8 V to 0.4 V were applied to the ECD device at a frequency of 1 Hz to effect a durability test. As a result, no deterioration of the electrochromic material was observed even after 2 x 104 times of coloring and discoloring operations.
