# Electronic image sensing apparatus.

## Abstract
An electronic still camera is disclosed which includes a solid state image sensor such as charge transfer device CTD 10 and a shutter mechanism 14 . For obtaining a still picture of one frame composed of two fields according to an NTSC television system, the shutter mechanism 14 is driven so as to be opened before and after a signal charge read out period of a CTD 10 by a shutter period control circuit 20 . With this arrangement, the field image light is incident on the CTD 10 in every field period.
