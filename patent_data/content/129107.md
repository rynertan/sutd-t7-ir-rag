# Magnetic tape recording and playback system.

## Abstract
A magnetic tape recording and playback system having a tape cassette 50 and battery pack 20 joined by a frangible connection 27 in an integral assembly 10 , wherein for recording the assembly 10 provides battery power to the recorder 40 and the recorder 40 provides recording signals to the cassette 50 and for playback, the battery 20 is broken away from the cassette 50 and discarded and the cassette 50 is inserted into the playback unit 70 , which can accept only the cassette 50 without the battery 20 . This prevents re use of the cassette in the recorder and assures the use of a fresh battery for each recording session.
