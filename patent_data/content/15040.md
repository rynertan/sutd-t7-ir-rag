## Description
This invention relates to a new system for teaching music and to a new electronic device suitable for carrying out and conducting such system. More particularly the invention relates to a new teaching system in which the duty of a music teacher in explaining, demonstrating and exercising the correct correlations between a music lesson on the one hand and music tones or sounds on the other hand, and eventually between music tones and the music notes of said lesson, is taken over by a device establishing automatically such correlations on behalf of the music student. In fact no mechanical or electromechanical provisions are presently known to applicant, carrying out such automatic correlations and providing the music student with direct and automatic information on the correctness of his performances. There are known indeed systems providing a pre established audiovisual correlation between given sets of music tones and music notes, or systems providing automatically visual representation with respect to tones generated on a music instrument, but none of those known systems allowed for an automatic direct and unequivocal correlation between the musical performances of a music student and a given set of musical tones. The invention now provides a means for such automatic direct and unequivocal correlation between music lessons and the performances of a music student.Basically, the system compares the music played by the student with a programmed lesson and gives automatically indications on the errors made by the student. The new music teaching system according to the invention there for establishes a direct and automatic pitch or pitch and rhytm correlation between memory stored sequences of musical tones and or groups of tones, and student played sequences of musical tones and or groups of tones, whereby there is provided a visual indication with respect to the memory stored sequence of musical tones and or groups of tones, as a function of said correlation. The functions thus established and provided in said new music teaching system, may thereby be controlled, carried out and conducted by electronic and or electromechanical means, which may for instance consist of a device as hereinfurther described also in accordance with the invention. According to the music teaching system of the invention, such electronic and or electromechanical means will contain in memory one or more reference sequences of musical tones andlor groups of tones, which constitute the lessons to be learned by the music student, such as melodies, tunes, musical scales, etc... There should thereby of course preferably be provided the possibility to change the lessons stored in the memory of the electronic and or electromechanical means conducting the system of the invention so as to afford unlimited teaching possibilities to said system. In the case of a teaching system according to the invention establishing a pitch and rhythm correlation between the memory stored and student played sequences, there may preferably further be comprised a provision for relative and or absolute tolerance with respect to the rhythm correlations between the memory stored and student played sequences of tones and or groups of tones. In a first prefered embodiment of the invention, the visual indication with respect to the memory stored sequence can in particular consist in showing on a display panel the musical note representation of the correct tones of said correlation between said memory stored sequence and said student played sequence of tones and or groups of tones. In another or a further prefered embodiment of the invention, the visual indication with respect to the memory stored sequence comprises showing an error indication on a display panel with respect to wrongly played tones in said correlation between said memory stored sequence and said student played sequence of tones and or groups of tones. According to the most prefered embodiment of the new music teaching system of this invention, said system will provide the opportunity for performing at will, the following functions reproducing in an audible manner the memory stored sequence of musical tones and or groups of tones reproducing in an audible manner the student played sequence of musical tones and or groups of tones establishing the direct and automatic correlation between said memory stored and student played se qeunces of musical tones and or groups of tones showing in a visible manner on a display, part or the whole of the musical note representation of said memory stored and or student played sequences of musical tones and or groups of tones providing visual indication in said displayed musical note representation, about the correctly and wrongly played tones in said correlation between said memory stored and said student played sequences of musical tones and or groups of tones. It may thereby comprise further provisions for automatically re establishing the further correlation between said memory stored and said student played sequences in spite of previous wrong tones and a limited number of missing andfor exceeding tones in the student played sequence of musical tones and or groups of tones. The invention on the other hand also provides a new electronic music teaching device suitable for carrying out and conducting the system according to the invention, which comprises a microprocessor means, cooperating with said microprocessor, for storing reference sequences of musical tones and or groups of tones and for reproducing said reference sequences means for allowing a user to produce sequences of musical tones and or groups of tones means cooperating with said microprocessor establishing a direct and unequivocal correlation between said user produced sequence and said reference sequence means , cooperating with said microprocessor, for generating visual indication with respect to the re ference sequence of musical tones and or groups of tones, as a function of said correlation between said user produced sequence and said reference sequence. More specifically such new electronic music teaching device may comprise a microprocessor a reader unit, cooperating with said microprocessor, for reading coded reference sequences of musical tones and or groups of tones from suitable software supports, whereby said coded information is stored into memory of the electronic microprocessor system a sound generating system cooperating with said micro processor, adapted to produce musical tones and to reproduce the decoded reference sequence of musical tones from the microprocessor system memory a keyboard cooperating with said sound generating sys tem, for allowing a user to produce audible tones, groups of tones and or sequences of tones and or groups of tones, according to his own selection a display control system, cooperating with said micro processor for generating visual information on a display unit comprised by or connected to said electro nic music device whereby the microprocessor system of the device is programmed so as to allow a direct an unequivocal correlation between the user produced sequence of tones and the reference sequence of tones stored into the microprocessor system memory, thereby operating the display control system to provide visual indication with respect to said reference sequence of tones as a function of said correlation. According to a prefered feature of the invention, the microprocessor of such new music teaching device may in particular comprise a built crystal oscillator, the musical tones being derived from said crystal oscillator by programmable timers. Such programmable timers will allow the generation of tones with a pitch error of less than 0.1 . In a first embodiment of the new device according to the invention, the reader unit thereof may in particular be adapted to read coded reference sequences of musical tones and or groups of tones from magnetic software supports selected from magnetic tapes, magnetic discs, magnetic cards and the like. In another embodiment of the device, the reader unit may on the other hand be adapted to read coded reference sequences of musical tones and or groups of tones from transparent films bearing an optic code with respect to such reference sequence. According to a further embodiment of the new music teaching device of the invention, the means or system for generating visual indication is preferably adapted to operate a display unit built of individual lights, corresponding in one to one correlation to the individual tones or groups of tones of the stored or storable reference sequences, said lights being selectively lightable as a function of the direct and unequivocal correlation between the user produced sequences and the reference sequences of tones or groups of tones, whereby lighted lights correspond to correctly produced tones whereas extinguished lights correspond to wrongly produced tones, or vice versa. Said display unit, built of individual lights may thereby conveniently make part of the device itself. In such case, the device may very suitably correspond to the embodiment in which the reader unit is adapted to read coded reference sequences of musical tones and or groups of tones from transparent films bearing an optic code with respect to such reference sequence, whereby the display unit built of individual lights may very suitably be adapted to receive said transparent film after its passage in said reader unit, said transparent film further bearing a visual image of the musical note representation of the coded reference sequence of musical tones and or groups of tones also borne by said transparent film, whereby the lights of said display unit are so arranged to each correspond respectively to one note or group of notes of said representation, thus allowing lighted indication of said note reprentation as a function of the correlation between the user produced sequences and the reference sequence of tones or groups of tones According to another further embodiment of the new music teaching device of the invention, the means or system for generating visual indication is adapted to operate a cathode ray tube C R T display or television TV screen. Said means or system for generating visual indication may thereby preferably comprise a character generator able to write the characters normally used is musical note representation such as notes, linked notes, clefs, measure signs, mols, sharps, rest signs, restoration signs, measure lines, etc... . It may further also suitably be adapted to generate a special error indication with respect to wrongly produced tones in the correlation between the reference sequence and the user produced sequence. It is a further desirable feature of the invention that the microprocessor system of the music teaching device is also adapted to store the user produced sequence of musical tones and or groups of tones. The new music teaching device according to the invention, may further also very suitably and preferably be adapted to reproduce whenever desired, any stored sequence of tones and or groups of tones, either any stored reference sequence and or any stored user produced sequence . The device according to the invention may also suitably comprise means for selectively limiting the reproduction of a stored sequence of tones and or groups of tones to a section of said sequence. This will enable the music student to specifically re listen and excercise that particular section of the lesson that causes him greater trouble or that he wishes to concentrate himself on, without having to play back again and again the complete sequence of his lesson and or of his exercise Another prefered feature of the invention provides for a metronome timing circuitry in the device cooperating with the microprocessor system, whereby said metronome timing circuitry controls the rhythm correlation between the reference sequence and the user produced sequence of tones and or groups of tones. The device may thereby comprise independant regulation means for said metronome timing circuitry, for speeding up or slowing down of the metronome timing performance, thereby allowing for the speeded up or slowed reproduction of any stored sequence of tones and or groups of tones. Such feature is most convenient in order to allow the music student to adapt the play back speed of the reference sequence and or the re listening of his own exercise sequences, and to adapt the tempo for the execution of his exercises, to his abilities and to his study progress. The metronome performance can thereby consist in audio or visual indications, or both. According to s till another possible feature of the device of the invention, there may be provided means for increasing or decreasing the pitch of all produced andior reproduced tones by one octave, thus increasing the performance range of said music device by two octaves. Apart from its specific function as a teaching device, the device according to the invention may of course in most of its embodiment, be adapted to be useable as a conventional music instrument, by virtue of its means for allowing a user to produce sequences of musical tones, and in particular as a conventional elec tronic organ nin such embodiments comprising a pianotype keyboard therefor. The embodiment of the device, comprising a means or system for generating visual indication which is specifically adapted to operate a cathode ray tube r R T display or television TV screen, may further also very conveniently be adapted to provide visual pitch indication on said CRT display or TV screen, when producing tone and or tone group sequences on said device according to ones own selection i.e. in a mere instrument mode of the device . According to still further features of the invention, the microprocessor system of the new music teaching device is preferably programmed in such manner to automatically reconstruct and re establish the one to one correlation between the reference sequence and the user produced sequence of tones and or groups of tones, in spite of any wrong tones, and a limited number of missing and or exceeding tones in said user produced se quench The new device according to the invention may further be adapted to allow the playing and the correlating of chords or groups of two or more tones at the same time. The latter features of the device will only be limited by the overall capacity of its microprocessor system. Depending on such capacity the device may thus for instance allow the playing of three, six or even more tones at the same time, so that the device may well be used for playing and correlating, i.e. teaching, the execution of two staffs synchronously left and right hand on the organ type embodiments . The characteristics and features of the invention set forth hereabove as well as further features and details thereof, will be explicitated through the following detailed description, in which reference is made to the attached drawings which represent by way of a purely illustrative example one specific embodiment of a music teaching device in accordance with said invention. In these drawings Figure 1 is a view in perspective of a music teaching device in accordance with the invention Figure 2 is an enlarged view of the display unit of the device of figure 1, with partially broken away front cover. The represented embodiment of the invention consisting in a music teaching device generally designated by the reference numeral 1 figure i , appears as an electronic organ adapted to perform the music teaching system in accordance with the invention. The device 1 therefor comprises an the one hand a set of operation means which are conventional for such electronic music instruments1 as well as novel features, in accordance with the invention, with respect to such mere music instrument operation of the device and on the other hand a set of functions and control means which are specific to the music teaching duty of said device. The represented device 1 thus comprises a main power switch 2, and a piano type keyboard 3 inthe present case 27 notes, from f to g2 for allowing the music student or player to play any desired sequence of tones or groups of tones It further comprises an internal loudspeaker 4 and auxiliary sockets 5, 6 and 7 for connecting respectively an external loudspeaker s , an external amplifier and or external headphones. The musical tones of the instrument 1 are derived from a cristal oscillator built in in the microprocessor of the device. In the specific embodiment described here, said microprocessor may for instance cnnsist of a 8048 microprocessor. The device 1 further includes a control panel, generally indicated by the reference numeral 8, which comprises a volume control slider 9, tempo control spiders 10 and 12 for the coarse regu lation slider 10 and the fine regulation slider 12 of the metronome speed between 40 and 240 strokes pro minute a metronome control cursor switch 13, allowing three positions for selecting between an audio mode metronome indication through the internal or external loudspeaker , a visual mode metronome indication through a display light 11 and a mode without metronome indication off. position an octave modifier cursor switch 14 allowing, accor ding to the selected position thereof, to increase, respectively decrease the pitch of each key of the instruments keyboard 3 by exactly one octave, thus broadening the overall performance of the instrument by two octaves an on off cursor switch 15 for adding a vibrato feature known per se for such electronic organ devices to the performance of the instrument keybuttons 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21 for controlling the specific teaching and excersizing duties of the device, in accordance with the music teaching system of the present invention, as explained more in detail therebelow. The specific means in connection with the actual teaching function of the device mainly include a reader display unit generally indicated by the reference numeral 22 in figure 1 and represented in greater detail in figure 2. The reader display unit 22, comprises a reader not appearing on the drawings for reading coded information 23 for a music lesson, from a transparent film card 24 optical code . This coded information is entered and stored into a memory RAM belonging to the microprocessor system of the device, by introducing the card 24 into the reader display unit 22 through a guiding slit 25 therefor. As soon as the card 24 is thus introduced into the device, the lesson tune sequence of musical tones and or groups of tones can be made to be heard and repeated as often as asked for, by actuating the key 18 starting the so called listen mode . Apart from the coded information 23 referred to hereabove, the film card 24 further also bears visual musical note information 26 in connection with the con sidered music lesson. The vizualization of this note representation 26 is performed by means of the display means 27 of the reader display unit 22, and controled by the microprocessor system of the teaching device. The display means is built of two arrays 28 of lights 29 in the present case two arrays of 20 lights individually separated by partition walls 30, and of a diffuser screen 31 bearing the representation of two musical staffs 32. The notes of the musical representation 26 are thereby written in such manner on the film card 24, that when said card 24 is positioned in the readerdisplay unit 22, each note or group of notes finds itself behind the staffs 32 of the diffuser screen 31, in a one to one correspondance with the lights 29 of the display means 27, and that when the lights 29 are off, it is not possible to see the musical note representation. The complete note representation 26 of the lesson may however be displayed by putting the display control switch 16 in on position and actuating the listen modesl key 18. By actuating the key 19 pay mode the music student can try to repeat the music sequence of the lesson on the keyboard 3 of the device. Thereby only those notes which have been correctly played, will appear lighted on the display screen 31, owing to the correlation that is being established by the microprocessor system between the melody played by the student and the reference melody of the lesson stored in the memory of the microprocessor. When the display control switch 16 is in off position, the correctly played notes will light up synchronously with the tones played, but when the display control switch 16 is in on position the correctly played notes will remain proJected on the screen 31, whereby only the wrongly played notes will keep extinguished. When the rhythm correlation key 47 is not in use position, the correlation between the lesson melody and the student melody is only established in connection with the pitch of each tone, but when the rhythm correlation key is in use, the complete correlation in connection with pitch and rhythm is established. The student can have his own played melody repeated as often as desired, by actuating the play back key 20. The displaying of the note representation will thereby perform in exactly the same manner as for the play mode key 19 of the device explained hereabove. The speed of the metronome performance and therefore the speed of the listen mode, and the play back mode n repetitions of stored melodies depending from said metronome performance, can be controled separately for each mode l1listen mode1,, play mode and play back mode by setting the metronome speed control sliders 10 and 12 in the desired position. By actuating the key 21 of the control panel 8, the device will be set in an I instrument mode 11 whereby the reader display unit 22, and the teaching or correlation function of the device will be disconnected. The device will then perform as a mere electronic organ, whereby the volume control 9, metronome control 10, 12 and 13 octave3modification function 14, vibrato function 15, and rhythm speed control function 17 are maintained. In view of the above specification of the invention it must be evident that said invention is not limited to the details disclosed in the specific description hereabove of one embodiment thereof, and that numerous modifications mat he provided to said details and many other embodiments of the invention may be proposed without leaving the general scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.
