# Apparatus and method for preassembling a top nozzle subassembly for a nuclear fuel assembly.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an apparatus for preassembling components of a top nozzle as a subassembly for subsequent mounting thereof on the skeleton of a nuclear fuel assembly, the components comprising a lower adapter plate 30 , guide thimble extensions 26 extending through holes in the adapter plate, an upper bearing plate 34 with passageways 38 for receiving upper end portions of the extensions 26 , hold down springs 46 between the adaptor and bearing plates, and lower and upper retainers 48, 50 cooperable in the finished sub assembly with the adaptor and bearing plates for maintaining the hold down springs partially compressed therebetween. The preassembling apparatus comprises a base 70 with compliant means 74, 76 for yieldingly supporting the lower ends of the guide thimble extensions and biasing the lower re tainers 48 thereon against the adaptor plate locating pins 78 insertable through the passageways of the bearing plate and into the upper end portions of the extensions to provide ax ial alignment and guidance for the latter with respect to the passageways and loading means 80, 86 operable to move the bearing plate toward adapter plate, thereby to compress the hold down springs between the plates and, at the same time, guidedly insert the upper end portions of the extensions into said passageways for connection of said end portions to the upper retainers 50 . An orientation plate 88 has align ment pins 90 which cooperate with scallops 56 in the lower retainers 48 to assure proper alignment of the scallops with fuel rods upon mounting of the subassembly on the fuel assembly skeleton.
