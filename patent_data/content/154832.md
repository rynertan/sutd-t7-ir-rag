# DECONTAMINATION USING ELECTROLYSIS

## Abstract
A method of decontaminating metal surfaces having a ra dioactive coating thereon where the coating contains metal ions, uses an aqueous decontamination solution containing at least one chelate which is passed over the coating to solubilize the metals. The solution is then passed through a porous di rect current electrode to reduce the metal ions in the solution the solution is again passed over the coating. An apparatus for decontaminating metal surfaces using the inventive method in cludes means for circulating the aqueous decontamination so lution among the porous cathode, and the metal surfaces and a container which stores the aqueous decontamination solu tion.
