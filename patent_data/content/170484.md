# ELAPSED TIME INDICATOR

## Abstract
An apparatus for indicating the lapse of a predetermined time period compises an indicator element 7 , which changes from a first state to a second state when an electrical potential difference is applied to it and reverts to the first state when the potential difference falls below a given value, in combination with a circuit with a bleed resistor 9 for controlling as a function of time a potential difference, applied to th indicator element 7 . A cell 1 may apply the potential difference. After a certain period of time the cell 1 will be effectively discharged through the bleed resistor 9 , the potential difference applied to the indicator element 7 will fall causing it to change state and sign 8 will then be visible. This indicates the end of the time period.
