# Transition metal composition, production and use.

## Abstract
A transition metal composition is obtained by treating at least one particulate support material with at least one organomagnesium compound, at least one cleavage agent and at least one transition metal compound of Groups IVA, VA or VIA of the Periodic Table. The support material is typically a metal oxide, such as alumina or silica. The organomagnesium compound is typically a dialkyl magne sium compound such as dibutyl magnesium. The cleavage agent may be an amine, a thioalcohol, an ester, a carboxylic acid or particularly an alcohol such as n butanol. The transition metal compound is added after the organomagne sium compound and the cleavage agent and is typically titanium tetrachloride. The product may be used as a catalyst component to polymerise an olefine monomer such as ethylene.
