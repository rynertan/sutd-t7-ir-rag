## Description
CIRCUIT ASSEMBLY SYSTEM TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention pertains to the field of robotic equipment, and more particularly to robotic systems for assembly of electrical components with printed circuit boards. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Robotic equipment is commonly employed in many industrial applications. In one important application, robotic equipment inserts electronic components into predetermined locations on printed circuit boards.Commonly, the boards are passed along an assembly line on a conveyor. At separate stations along the line, insertion machines insert components of the same type.The robotic equipment of the prior art are generally unable to handle more than one size or shape of components without changing or modifying the machine to accommodate the different part. Thus, a different machine station may typically be employed to insert each different sized or shaped component. This, of course, greatly increases the capital equipment cost of the product insertion line, and increases the physical space needed to house and support the assembly line. For components which have nonstandard shapes and sizes and or for which small quantities are used in the circuit, hand labor is typically employed to finish the insertion process for each board, thus further reducing the speed and efficiency by which the boards may be assembled. Numerous mechanisms are known for automatically clinching component leads which have been inserted through apertures in printed circuit boards. Passive systems are known which move the part so that the leads strike a bending surface, to bend the leads in a manner analogous to the manner in which a paper stapler operates. Active clinchers hold the electrical component stationery, but move a die to deflect the leads in a predetermined direction. The dies employed are often jaw like members which open and close to bend the leads. Typically, the die is particularly adapted to clinching the leads of a predetermined part type, e.g., for a dual inline integrated circuit package, and to bend or clinch all the leads aligned in a row. In large part, the known clincher systems are expensive to manufacture and maintain, and are specialized systems for performing a single predetermined function. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A system for automatic insertion of electrical components into printed circuit boards is disclosed. The system comprises a component presentation robot for delivering a predetermined component to a presentation station, and a component insertion robot for gripping the presented component at the presentation stage, and inserting the component into the circuit board at an insertion station. The presentation robot selects a predetermined electrical component type from one or more component storage areas, and presents the component to a presentation station, which also serves as a lead straightening and cutting station. This station comprises a pair of plates through which an opening pattern of funnel shaped openings have been formed. The lower plate is movable laterally with respect to the upper plate to provide a lead clamping and cutting function. The component presentation robot is adapted to deliver the selected component to the presentation station. The robot then inserts the component leads into corresponding opening patterns formed in the plates and oscillates the component body through a series of predetermined movements, repetitively exercising the leads in relation to the component body.The oscillatory movement is adapted to cause the lead positions to assume an averaged, straightened position. Once the predetermined series of lead straightening movements have been carried out, the presentation robot releases the component, and the lower plate is shifted slightly with respect to the upper plate to clamp the component leads. The component insertion robot then grips the body of the component and a lead cutting operation may be performed, wherein the lower plate is shifted through a shearing movement to shear the leads extending below the first plate. The component insertion robot then inserts the component at a predetermined position on the printed circuit board. One aspect of the invention is a programmable clinching system for clinching leads of inserted components. The clinching system comprises a retractable clinching element mounted on a motor driven carriage assembly for passing the clinching element through a predetermined path of travel adjacent the lower surface of the printed circuit board. The clincher element operates in combination with the component insertion robot so that, as each component is inserted into the board, the clincher element is passed beneath the inserted component in a clinching movement to clinch one or more of the component leads and thereby secure the inserted component in position. The cycle comprising component presentation, lead straightening and cutting, board insertion, and lead clinching is then repeated until all components have been inserted in the board. A conveyor system is employed to transport the fully inserted board away from the insertion station, and to transport an empty board to the insertion station.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The present invention comprises a novel robotic system for insertion of electrical components into printed circuit boards. The following description of the preferred embodiment is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention. Various modifications to the disclosed embodiment will be readily apparent. The invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiment shown, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and novel features of the invention. Referring now to FIG. 1, a perspective view is shown of components of a robotic system in accordance with the present invention. In this embodiment, robot 10 comprises a model RT 3000 robot marketed by Seiko Instruments USAInc. This robot is a programmable, 4 axis DC servo robot with nominal positional repeatability of .001 inches.Robot arm 15 extends from the robot body 20 along axis 25.The arm is selectively extensible and retractable along axis 25, and is rotatable about the center axis 30 of the robot body 20. The body 20 is also selectively extensible and retractable along axis 30 to raise and lower the arm 15. The robot 10 also includes a central controller and a keyboard interface not illustrated in FIG. 1 which allows the system operator to interface with the central controller. As is well known to those skilled in the art, the system controller is programmed to carry out predetermined movements and operational sequences. Thus, the controller is programmed to relate the known position of the leads of the component held at a pickup station to the known location on the circuit board at which the component is to be inserted. The end effector is attached to the extensible end of arm 15. As is well known to those skilled in the art, the end effector is employed to interface with the components to be handled by the robotic system. The components 60 are delivered to a pick up station 70. The robot controller is programmed to cause the robot arm to move the end effector to above the pick up station 70, and then to lower the end effector so as to grip the next component in the conveyor line. The pick up station employs a pneumatically operated component lead clamping vise 60, which clamps the component leads to fix the component at the predetermined pick up point. Illustrating another aspect of the invention, FIGS.2 and 3 are top plan views of an apparatus which is advantageously employed to clinch the leads of components which have been inserted into a printed circuit board, for example, by th above described component insertion robot.In this embodiment, the apparatus comprises a table surface 620 having a large aperture 622 formed therein. A printed circuit board 610 shown in phantom is suspended over the aperture 622 by attachment to elongated support ribs 624, 626. The ribs 624, 626 are preferably adjustable in their position over the aperture 622 so as to accommodate variously sized circuit boards. The surface 620 is translatable along the axis of arrow 624 shown in FIG. 3. As will be described in more detail below, this embodiment comprises means for translating the table surface 20 between the respective positions illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3. With at least one electrical component, inserted in the circuit board 610 and gripped by the insertion robot, a retractable clincher element 650 mounted for translational movement throughout a plane which is parallel to and beneath the printed circuit board travels through a controlled series of predetermined movements to selectively contact and clinch individual leads of the component. As used herein, clinching a component lead refers to the bending of a component lead away from the nominal lead position, perpendicular to the printed circuit board, to a bent or clinched location adjacent the printed circuit board. The clincher element movement is controlled by a processor which is programmed with information defining the desired path the clincher element is to travel. Thus, the system user is able to adapt the system to the clinching requirements for virtually any circuit board and any type of inserted component. To achieve the capability for controllable movement, the clincher element 650 is mounted in an assembly 655, which in turn is carried by an upper carriage assembly 670 supported for lateral movement on a pair of lateral rods 680, 682. The ends of the lateral rods 680, 682 are in turn mounted in first and second lower carriage assemblies 690, 692, respectively, carried for longitudinal movement on opposed longitudinal rods 694, 696. Lateral drive means are provided for driving the upper carriage assembly 670 to traverse the lateral extent of the lateral rods 680, 682. Similarly, longitudinal drive means are provided for driving the lower carriage assemblies 690, 692, which carry the lateral rods 680, 682 and upper carriage assembly 670, to traverse the longitudinal extent of rods 694, 696. The lateral drive means comprises the upper stage stepper motor 702, mounted to carriage 690 by bracket 704.Motor 702 comprises a stepper motor, model M063, marketed by the Superior Electric Company. As shown in FIG. 4, the motor 702 is coupled through motor coupler 703 to the drive shaft of drive pulley 705. Pulley 705 is mounted on bracket 704 for rotation about an axis in line with the axis of the motor 702. Idler pulley 710 is carried by pulley bracket 712 mounted on carriage assembly 692. Idler pulley 710 and drive pulley 705 are mounted for rotation about respective pulley axes which are substantially parallel. A stainless steel cable 714 having a diameter of .065 inches is reeved around the drive pulley 705 and the idler pulley 710, and its ends are secured in cable fixtures 671, 673, which are respectively secured in opposite sides of the upper carriage 670. Rotation movement of the motor shaft causes the drive pulley 705 to rotate. Rotational movement of the drive pulley 705 imparts a driving force to the cable 714, resulting in movement of the upper carriage 70 along the rods 680, 682. So long as there is no cable slippage, the extent of the movement of carriage 70 is precisely related to the rotation of the motor shaft. Thus, each angular movement step by the motor shaft can be translated to a translational movement by the carriage 670. In the disclosed embodiment, each step of the motor 702 results in the translation by .001 inch of carriage 70. The carriage 670 comprises a pair of ball bushing members 670a, 670b and a center carriage bracket 670c fixedly coupling the bushing members and supporting the clinch ball assembly 655. In this embodiment, ball bushing members 670a, 670b comprise Thompson ball bushings, model Super 6, which are mounted on rods 680, 682, which have a diameter of .375 inches. The ball bushings 670a, 760b and the rods 680, 682 are adapted to provide extremely low friction, facilitating linear travel of the carriage along the rods 680, 682. With reference to FIGS. 4 6 and 8, the longitudinal drive means comprises the lower stage stepper motor 723, secured to lower surface 618 by a mounting bracket 724, as shown in FIG. 9. In the disclosed embodiment, motor 620 comprises a model M093 stepper motor marketed by theSuperior Electric Company. The motor shaft 721 is coupled to drive pulley 723 by coupler 722. Drive pulley 723 is rotatably mounted for rotation about the motor shaft axis. As illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5, idler pulleys 726, 727, 728 and 729 are mounted for rotational movement adjacent the motor 720 and ends of longitudinal rods 694 and 696. Idler pulleys 730 and 731 are mounted for rotational movement adjacent the other end of the rods 690 and 692. Cable 725 is reeved about the drive pulley 723 and about upper pulley 727, and end 725a is secured to the carriage 90 by cable bracket 734. On the side of carriage 690 opposite from bracket 735, end 725b of cable 725 is secured to carriage 90 by cable bracket 735. Cable 725 is reeved about idler pulley 729 from drive pulley 723, and is passed to the other end of rod 692 to idler pulley 731. The cable 725 is reeved about pulley 731, and end 725c is secured to carriage 692 by cable bracket 736. On the side of carriage 692, opposite from bracket 736, end 725d of cable 725 is secured by cable bracket 737. From bracket 737, the cable 725 is reeved about idler pulley 728, and passes diagonally downwardly to pulley 726. From pulley 726, the cable 725 passes to the opposite end of rod 690, where it is reeved about pulley 730 and passed to cable bracket 735. The lower carriage assemblies 690, 692 respectively comprise bushing members 690a, 692a, which respectively encircle longitudinal rods 694, 696. In this embodiment, ball bushing members 690a, 692a comprise Thompson ball bushings, model Super 12, and the rod 694, 696 have a diameter of .75 inches. The ball bushings 690a, 692a and the rods 694, 696 are adapted to provide extremely low friction, facilitating linear travel of carriages 690, 692 along the longitudinal extent of the rods 694, 696. The cable and pulley system shown in FIGS. 4 and 5 thus provides a means of converting rotational movement of the motor shaft 721 into translational cable movement.Both carriages 690 and 692 are driven by the cable 725, in response to rotations of the motor shaft 721. As with the lateral drive system, the longitudinal movement of the carriages 690 and 692 is precisely related to the rotational shaft movement of motor 720, with each step of motor 720 resulting in .001 inches of longitudinal movement of the carriages 690, 692 along the rods 694, 696. Thus, by controlling motor 720, clincher ball assembly 655 can be longitudinally positioned. Stepper motors 702 and 720 are controlled by motor drivers, which receive digital drive signals from a system controller. The system controller generates appropriate drive signals to cause the stepper motors to drive the clincher element assembly through a desired path of travel and or to a desired position. In the disclosed embodiment, the clinching element is driven at velocities up to 100 inches per second. Referring now to FIG. 9, the clincher assembly 655 comprises a double acting air cylinder assembly, mounted to the carriage 670. Such air cylinders are commercially available, and in the disclosed embodiment, a Fabco Air model F 7 X, with a 3 4 inch bore and 5 8 inch stroke, is employed. The air cylinder assembly 655 comprises cylinder wall 655a and hollow outer piston rod assembly 655b. The outer piston rod 655b is integrally formed with a piston 655v. A pair of ports 655x, 655y are formed through the wall of the cylinder 655a to communicate with opposing chambers 655m, 655O defined by cylinder 655a, bushings 655e, 655f and piston 655v. The air cylinder assembly is fitted with 0 ring seals 655e at appropriate locations to prevent air leaks.A pair of air lines 655i and 655j communicate with chamber 655m and 655O, respectively through the ports 655x, 655y, and are respectively coupled to sources of air pressure or vacuum. The piston rod assembly 655b is forced upwardly or downwardly in dependence upon the relative pressurization of chambers 655m and 6550. The stroke of the piston rod assembly is nominally five eighth inches in the disclosed embodiment. Thus, by selective pressurization of the respective chambers, the piston rod assembly, to which the clinching element 650 is attached, is forced either into the upward state for clinching or the downward retracted state. In the extended clinching position, the clinching element is directly adjacent the lower surface of the circuit board, almost in contact with the surface. In the retracted position, the clinching element 605 is disposed well beneath the lower surface of the board so as not to contact downwardly extending leads. The clinching element 650 comprises a rounded ball element, having as nominal diameter of 5 16 inches, and is secured to inner rod 655p by threaded securing means or the like. The inner rod member 655p is biased in a concentric relationship with outer rod 655b by elastic centering ring 655h and plastic insulating bushing 655t. A pair of plastic insulating bushings 655e and 655f are employed to located the outer piston rod assembly 655b with respect to the cylinder housing members 655q and 655r. One aspect of the invention is the provision of a tactile sensing means for detecting whether the clinch operation has been successfully performed. The sensor comprises means for sensing for electrical continuity between the outer piston 655b and inner rod member 655p.Due the elasticity of the centering ring 655h, the inner rod may be deflected from its normal concentric position in relation to the outer rod member 655b. When it is deflected, for example, by the deflection force resulting from the collision of a component lead with clinching element 650, electrical continuity is achieved between the inner rod 655p and the end outer member 655b in the region between plastic insulating washer 655g and the elastic centering ring 655h. A monitoring circuit, shown generally in FIG. 9 as circuit 655s, is coupled between the outer rod 655b and the inner rod 655p by wires 655r and 655z, respectively. The clinch system controller monitors the circuit output. Plastic insulating bushing 655t secures the lower ends of the respective inner and outer rod members in electrical isolation in their concentric relationship.Wire 655z is secured to the inner rod member by a pair. of lock nuts 655u. The wires 655r, 655z and the two air lines 655i and 655j are brought away from the air cylinder assembly 655 as an umbilical line, which is trailed or dragged behind the air cylinder as it is moved about by the carriage assemblies. Referring now to FIG. 10, the air cylinder assembly 655 is shown with the clinching element in the extended or clinch state in contact with the lead of an inserted electrical component. The electrical lead exerts a deflection force on the ball 655, which deflects the inner rod 655p with respect to the outer rod 655b so as to achieve electrical continuity between the two members, resulting in a clinching signal from the monitoring circuit. Of course, the clinch ball 655 also exerts a clinch force on the lead, such that the lead is clinched or bent along the underside of 610b of the board 610. FIG. 11 is a cross sectional view taken along line 11 11 of FIG. 10 illustrating the relative position 610b of the clinch ball in relation to the leads of the electrical component and the printed conductors on the underside of the printed circuit board 610. FIG. 7 illustrates one of the two air cylinders which serves to position the table surface 620 in one of the position shown in FIG. 2 or FIG. 3. The upper table surface 620 is supported by conventional means not shown , such as a slide mechanism, for lateral movement with respect to lower table surface 618. Bracket 631 is affixed to table 618 and supports one end of air cylinder 630. Bracket 632a is affixed to the underside of table surface 620, and supports the other end of air cylinder 630. Actuation of the air cylinder 630 exerts a force tending to separate the bracket 632a and the bracket 631, causing the upper surface to slide laterally toward the position illustrated in FIG. 3. A second air cylinder 633, shown in FIG. 4, is configured to provide an oppositely directed force to slide the surface 620 toward the position shown in FIG. 2. Alternatively, a single double acting air cylinder may be employed to slide the table surface between the two positions illustrated inFIGS. 2 and 3. The provision of means to translate the table surface 620, which carries the circuit board, with respect to the clinch element drive system, increases the maximum board size which may be accommodated by the clinch system.A particular board can be disposed at one of the two surface 620 positions, and the components inserted and clinched in the portion of the board accessible to the clinch element. The surface 620 with the board may then be shifted to the second position, and components inserted and clinched in the portion of the board now available to the clinch element. A plurality of position sensors are employed to accurately determine a reference position for the clincher element 650, for example, in relation to the insertion robot system, and provide end of travel information to prevent the clincher element from accidental out of limit contact with other structural elements. Left and right upper stage travel limit sensors 640, 641 comprise photoelectric sensors. The sensors compriseLED light source 640a, 641a and photodetectors 640b, 641b.The sources project respective light beams along axis 640c, 641c which are detected by the respective detectors 640b, 641b. Lateral movement of upper carriage assembly 670 so as to interrupt the light beam on either side causes an out of limit signal to be generated by the appropriate detector 604b or 641b. In the disclosed embodiment, the photoelectric sensors comprise two miniature LED pairs, models L33 and P33 marketed by theSkan A Matic Corporation. The lower stage travel limit sensors comprise Hall effect sensors. A magnet 643 is mounted to lower carriage 692. Hall effect sensors 643a, 643b are mounted to the lower table surface 618 in appropriate locations relating to the upper and lower end of travel limits for the lower carriage 692. As the carriage 692 is passed in close proximity to the one of the Hall effect sensors, its magnetic field triggers the sensor. Sensor 643c is the home or reference position sensor. This position is the reference or start position to which the clinch element is typically set at the commencement of clinch operations for each board. The controller references the various clinch element movements from the home position. FIG. 24 is a control block diagram illustrative of the clincher control system. A system controller 850, which comprises a personal computer system such as the IBMPC personal computer with memory display and keyboard peripherals, provides overall system control. The system controller is coupled to interface device 852 by an RS 2 3 2 interface bus 851. For the disclosed embodiment, the interface device is part of a motor control and drive system for the Superior Electric motors 702, 720 described above. The interface device 852 comprises the Modulynx system controller card, model number lOD 009 marketed by the Superior Electric Company. The interface device 852 is coupled by 50 pin bus 870 to the upper and lower stage drive systems. The upper stage drive system comprises indexer circuit 864, theModulynx indexer card model number IMD 128 and driver card 865, the Modulynx driver card model number DRD 002A. Both devices 864, 865 are marketed by the Superior ElectricCompany. The driver card 865 drives the stepper motor 702. The upper stage travel limit sensors 640b, 641b are coupled through the respective amplifiers 640d, 641d to the indexer card 864. An out of limit signal from one of the sensors provides an interrupt signal stopping the motor 702 from further operation in the out of limit direction. This interrupt provides a soft stop, n i.e., the system controller may drive the clincher assembly 655 up to a travel limit, where the motor is stopped, and then drive the assembly 655 away from the limit. The lower drive system comprises index card 866, also a Modulynx index card model IMD 128, and motor driver 867, a Modulynx driver card, model DRD 003. Bus 873 couples the index card 866 to motor driver 867. Bus 874 couples the motor driver 874 to motor 720. The lower stage travel limit sensors 643a,b are coupled to indexer card 866. An out of limit signal from one of the signals provices an interrupt signal providing a soft stop which stops the motor 720 from further operation in the respective out of limit direction. The home position sensors 643c is coupled to the system controller 850. The system controller 850 also controls the operation of air valves not shown controlling the operation of the air cylinder of the clinch assembly 650. The air valves and air cylinder are indicated in FIG. 24 as block 871. The interface device 852 is further coupled to the clinch tactile sensor circuit 855 through latch circuit 855, comprising a relay, and to the teaching and manual control pendant 858. The sensor 855 provides a feedback signal to the controller 850 indicating whether a desired clinch has occurred. The pendant 858 enables manual operation of the clinch system and, in combination with an operator keyboard comprising the controller 850, provides a means of manually teaching or entering a desired clinch path.The pendant includes four separate switches for X, X, Y, Y movement, a clinch up switch for extending the clinch element 650 into the extended clinch state, a step jog switch to select signal step or jog movement modes, a emergency stop switch and a switch for selecting between manual or processor control. In a typical manual teaching sequence, an identifying number for the component to be clinched is entered into the controller 850 via the keyboard. Then the operator by manually manipulating the X, X, Y, Y controls appropriately, moves the clinch element 650 to the appropriate start position required to initiate the desired clinch path. The start position of the clinch element for this component, in relation to the home position, is then stored in the memory of the controller 850. The controller 850 is adapted to keep track of the position of the clinch element in relation to the system home position by monitoring the number of motor steps and their direction from the home position. If, during the next move, it is desired to clinch a lead of the component, the operator activates the clinch up control on the pendant 858. The appropriate movement controls X, X, Y, Y are then activated to execute the desired clinch path. If the leads are not be clinched during this sequence of moves, the clinch up switch is not activated. In the next step of the teach sequence, the final position of the clinch head and clinch element up or down are stored in the controller memory. The preceding two steps are then repeated to perform all desired clinching movements for the particular component. The entire sequence is then repeated for each of the components on the board requiring clinching. Once the teaching mode is completed for the components inserted on a particular board, the processor 850 will have been provided, for each component, with a component identification number, a clinch path start position, and a plurality of successive intermediate clinch element positions, each with corresponding clinch element positions extended or retracted . These data enable the processor to automatically repeat the clinch element path pattern for each component in a run operation. In a simple run operation, the operator may manually enter into the processor 850 the identification number of the component to be clinched, and then signal to the processor to execute the stored clinch cycle for that component. Under control of the processor 850, the previously stored or taught clinch path of the clinch element will be executed while the element 650 moves up and down as required to clinch the desired leads of the component. The clinch system will typically be operated in cooperation with a component insertion robot, as described above. As each component is inserted into the board, the clinching system will be operated to clinch one or more of the leads of the inserted component. Typically, the entire insertion and clinch operation will be coordinated and executed automatically under control of the processor 850. Moreover, it is expected that the system will be data driven by positional data and cycle instructions provided as a result of computer aided design techniques, rather than by manually teaching each of the movements of the cycle. Referring now to FIG. 12, a perspective view is shown of an embodiment of a component insertion system embodying the invention. In general, the component insertion system comprises a component presentation module which includes a presentation robot 900 for selecting a component from one of a plurality of component feeder devices and providing the selected component to a presentation station for lead straightening and cutting.A component insertion module includes an insertion robot, which retrieves the component at the presentation station and inserts it into the printed circuit board. The component insertion module further comprises a clinching system as described above for clinching the leads of the inserted component. The component presentation module comprises a presentation robot 900 and one or more component feeder devices. Thus, for example, the component presentation module may include tube or stick feeders 907, vibratory bowl feeders 908 910, tape feeders 912, and tray feeders 913. The feeder devices per se are well known and need not be described in further detail. The component presentation robot 900 is adapted to pick up a component from one of the feeder devices and present the component to the presentation station 775.The presentation robot 900 comprises a 4 axis servo robot, marketed by Adept Technology, Inc., Sunnyvale, California, as in the Adept One robot. The system further comprises a printed circuit board locating and transfer system the BLT system which automatically transfer the board into and out of the system work cell. The printed circuit board is precisely located at the insertion station 772 by the BLT system during the assembly cycle so that the board position is precisely registered with respect to the component insertion and clinching operations. In the disclosed embodiment, the board locating and transfer system comprises a printed circuit board conveyor system 750.The conveyor system is adapted to automatically convey the printed circuit board which is mounted on the conveyor into position to and from the insertion station 772. Another aspect of the invention is a means for straightening the component leads and cutting them to a predetermined length. The lead straightening and cutting means comprises a pair of plates disposed at the presentation station, in combination with the presentation robot 900. In accordance with the invention the presentation robot 900 inserts the component leads into oversized lead openings formed in the straightener cutter plates, and then oscillates the component body through a predetermined series of movements, bending the leads back and forth in a repetitive exercising motion so as to straighten the leads. The presentation robot 900 then releases the component body, with its leads clamped in the lead straightening and cutting plates. At this point the component insertion robot 920 moves to the presentation station 775 and its end effector 922 grips the body of the component. If the leads are not to be cut, the lead clamp is released and the part is inserted. However, if the leads are to be cut, the lower plate is moved by a powerful shear cylinder to shear the leads. The component is then inserted by the insertion robot system 920. In this embodiment, robot 920 comprises the Seiko robot system. Another facet of this embodiment is to employ the clinching apparatus described hereinabove to clinch the leads of the components as they are inserted into the printed circuit board. Thus, as each part is inserted into the board, the clincher element is operated through a preprogrammed clinching movement to clinch its leads. The insertion robot then releases that component and returns to the next station. For the embodiment shown in FIG. 12, the rectangular upper table surface 602 as described with respect to the clinching system embodiment shown in FIG. 2 is replaced by elements of the conveyor system. Thus, the system described in FIG. 12 is a general purpose and flexible system adapted to efficiently select a part to be inserted, straighten and cut the leads, and then insert and subsequently clinch the leads to the printed circuit board. The system is highly flexible in that it is not limited to a single board application, but rather is programmable to accommodate a wide variety of printed circuit boards, components, and assembly operations. Moreover, no mechanical changes are required to shift from one type of board to another. So long as the required components are made available at the feeder devices, the system can accommodate different board products simply by modifying the system software. This is a substantial advantage over systems which require mechanical retooling to change over from one product to another. Referring now to FIG. 14, a top view of the conveyor system 750 is illustrated. The conveyor comprises a pair of flexible chains comprising a plurality of linked chain elements which are reeved about idler and drive pulleys disposed along the longitudinal extent of the conveyor. In the disclosed embodiment, the conveyor 750 com prises a pair of elongated side rails 751, 752 mounted in substantially parallel relationship. Each of the side rails 751, 752 comprises a channel whose width is adapted to receive an extending leg of the respective chain element. This is shown, for example, in FIG. 15, a cross sectional view taken along line 25 25 of FIG. 14, wherein an element of chain 755 is shown with a leg member 755a disposed in a receiving channel 752a formed in the side rail 752. In the FIGS. 14 and 18, idler shaft 756 and idler pulleys 757 and 757a, as well as drive shaft 758, drive pulley 759 and drive motor 760 are visible or shown in phantom. The printed circuit boards 770 are received in a board bracket 768 for transport along the conveyor 750.The conveyor 750 is fitted with clamping means for clamping the board bracket 768 in fixed position. The clamping means is illustrated in FIGS. 16 and 17. In the longitudinal cross section of FIG. 16, the upper rail 763 is shown in relation to the elongated side rail 752. The upper rail 763 is mounted for vertical movement on shafts of the air cylinders 764 and 765. Thus, by actuation of the air cylinders 764, 765 the rail 763 may be moved vertically upwardly or downwardly so that in the downward position the board bracket is clamped between the adjacent surfaces of rails 752 and 763. Upper rail 762 is supported in a similar fashion by a corresponding pair of air cylinders. In the horizontal cross sectional view of FIG. 17, the bracket 768 is shown as it is supported between the two conveyor chains 754, 753. The upper rails 763, 766 are illustrated in the raised position with respect to the bracket 768. Thus, by actuation of the pairs of air cylinders supporting the upper rails 763, 766, these rails may be brought into clamping relationship so as to clamp the bracket 768 in a fixed position. The component insertion station is generally indicated by phantom line 772 in FIG. 14. With the printed circuit board 770 held in bracket 768, which is in turn clamped in position by the rail clamp as described above, a clinching system such as has been described with respect to FIGS. 2 11 may be constructed in relation to the insertion station 772. In this application, the table surface 620 of the previous embodiment is replaced with the conveyor system 750 and the bracket 768. The component presentation station 775 FIG. 24 receives the selected component from the presentation robot 900. At this station, the component leads are straightened and cut to a predetermined length. Referring now to FIGS. 19 22, the elements at station 775 comprising the component lead straightener and cutting system are disclosed in simplified form. The lead straightening and cutting system comprises a pair of plates operated in combination with the component presentation robot 900. Straightener plate 778 and shear plate 779 are arranged in a parallel, contiguous relationship. The lateral position of upper plate 778 is fixed. The thickness of straightener plate 778 determines the length of the component leads after the shearing operation. This thickness will depend on the particular application in the disclosed embodiment, plate 778 has a thickness of 3 16 inches. A plurality of funnel shaped openings are formed in the plates 778, 779, defining one or more opening patterns respectively corresponding to the component lead pattern of one or more components. The hole patterns employed in the preferred embodiment extend over a 2 inch by 4 inch rectangular area, to accommodate components as large as 2 inches by 4 inches. There is formed in the plates 778, 779 a plurality of opening patterns which will collectively accommodate the various types of components to be inserted into the particular board, or into a plurality of board types. The system is programmed with information defining the respective position of each opening pattern, and the robot 900 is adapted to insert the respective component into the corresponding opening pattern. The openings formed in straightening plate 778 are funnel shaped, as illustrated in the cross sectional view of FIG. 22. The size of the openings will depend on the diameters of the component leads to be inserted, and the component lead spacing. For components having in line leads, the respective funnel openings may be arranged as series of tangential openings to maximize the ability to insert bent leads into the openings in the straightening plate. A typical opening size is .120 inches at the top of the funnel opening in plate 778, and .067 inches at the bottom of the funnel. Shear plate 779 is mounted in a sliding relationship with respect to straightner plate 778. The position of lower plate 779 in relation to plate 778 is determined by the opposing clamp and shear air cylinders 782 and 784.The air cylinders 782, 784 are secured to opposing ends of lower plate 779 in an axially aligned relationship, as shown in phantom in FIG. 21. With the plates 778, 779 aligned so that the respective openings in each plate are aligned, the presentation robot is adapted to insert the component leads into the appropriate opening pattern in plates. Air cylinder 782 has a diameter of about 1 2 inch, to which a supply of pressurized air at 100 psi is selectively coupled through a valve not shown , to exert a laterally clamping force, typically about 20 pounds on plate 779. The purpose of cylinder 782 is to clamp the leads in position by slightly moving the lower plate in relation to upper plate 778.The clamping force is not sufficient to shear the component leads. The purpose of shear cylinder 784 is to exert a shearing force on the lower plate 779 so as to forceably move the lower plate 779 in relation to upper plate 778 so as to shear the component leads as they extend below the plate 778. In the disclosed embodiment, the air cylinder 784 has a diameter of 4 inches and a 1 8 inch stroke, and is coupled selectively to a 100 psi air supply through an air valve not shown to exert 1200 pounds of cutting forces. Shear cylinder 784 comprises shear arm 784a which is connected to a clevis 779a, secured to the plate 779. The pin 784c extends through slot 784b formed in arm 784a to secure the clevis 779a to the arm 784a. The slot allows free clamping movement of the lower plate 779 caused by actuation of air cylinder 782, without requiring the clamp cylinder 782 to exert enough force to move the shear cylinder 784. A pair of microswitch sensors 790, 791 are appropriately arranged to be triggered by arm 779b mounted to the clevis 779a. Sensor 790 indicates that the plates are in the aligned position, and sensor 791 indicates the end oftravel for the shear motion, providing a positive indication that the shear action has been performed. The lead straightening and cutting system further comprises the presentation robot 900. The robot 900 employs an end effector 905, shown in FIG. 23, mounted on robot arm 901, to grip the components at the feeder devices. The end effector is adapted for a 450 pitch angle to accommodate gravity feeder tracks, and can be actuated to rotate 450 to squarely present the gripped component to the presentation station 775. The end effector body member 906 is adapted to rotate about hinge pin 906a in response to the force executed by the air cylinders 907a, 906b. The air cylinders comprise arms 907c, 907d, which are secured to corresponding clevis members 906b,c formed on body member 906. The end effector components are cooperatively arranged so that the gripping fingers may be disposed at a 45C angle from the horizontal, or at the horizontal plane. The end effector 905 comprises two pairs of fingers, an outer pair 905a, 905b, each formed with a respective protruding tang 905c, 905d, and an inner pair 905e, 905f. The outer fingers 905a, 905b are each mounted for translation in directions normal to the plane of surface 905i, i.e., into and out of the plane defined by surface 905i. Each of fingers 905a, 905b is biased in the extended position illustrated in FIG. 23 by low pressure air cylinders not shown . The inner fingers 905e, 905f are arranged for translation toward and away from each other. Their movement is driven by pneumatic air cylinder means not shown and is synchronized such that each finger is driven inwardly or outwardly in synchronization with the other finger. The fingers 905e, 905f are arranged to exert a strong gripping force on the gripped components, greater than 50 pounds, to firmly grip the component for the lead straightening sequence. The end effector 905 further comprises a hold down pin 905g which is biased in the extended position shown inFIG. 23 by a spring or air cylinder not shown , but which may be depressed inwardly. The end effector further comprises a microswitch sensor 905h mounted to indicate when the inner fingers have fully closed. The sensor 905h thus provides a signal that the fingers 905e, 905f have failed to grip a part, since the fingers do not go the fully closed position when a part has been gripped. The operation of the end effector is more fully described with reference to FIGS. 26 a c . FIG. 26 a illustrates a partial side view of a tube feeder 925, arranged at a 450 angle from the horizontal. A plurality of components 927 having in line leads are stored in tube 927. The feeder 925 includes a central rib 925 d . The leads of the components 927 straddle central rib 925 d .A retainer pin 925 c is passed through the end of rib 925d. A novel aspect is the L shaped spring clip 925a secured by fastener 925b to the body of feeder 925. TheL shaped clip 925a further includes a curved tang 925d, and the elongated side 925e forms a 900 angle with retainer portion 925f. While not visible in the side view, retainer portion 925f is about one third the length of side portion 925e. The purpose of clip 925a is to provide a stop means preventing the leads of components 927 from colliding with pin 925c and thereby bending the leads. With the clip in the position shown in FIG. 26 a the trailing or back edge of the first component is retained inside the tube, preventing the component from tumbling out of the feeder 925 as the components are loaded. Referring now to FIGS. 26 b , c , side views of the end effector 905 and the feeder 925 are shown, with FIG.26 b illustrating an initial contacting position as the end effector initially engages the feeder 925, and FIG.26 c illustrating a fully engaged position for extracting the component. The end effector is moved along axis 925g from the position of FIG. 26 b to that of FIG. 26 c . The outer finger 905a initially engages the clip 925a, and depresses it out of engagement with the body of component 927. Component 927 then slides down the central rib into engagement with pin 925c. As the effector approaches the feeder 925, the tang 905c engages the body of feeder 925, and as the effector 905 moves to the fully engaged position, the outer finger 905a slides inwardly into surface 905i, against the bias of its corresponding air cylinder. In the fully engaged position of FIG. 26 c , the inner jaws 905e, 905f are in position to grip the component 972, the hold down pin 905g having engaged the trailing edge of the component 927 to hold the component down into contact with central rib 925d, allowing the end effector 905 to squarely grip the component 927. As shown in the top view of FIG. 13, the presentation robot 900 selects one component from the plurality of component feeders. The end effector 905 is adapted to securely grip the body of the selected component for the ensuing lead straightening sequence. In this sequence, the presentation robot moves to the presentation station 775, and inserts the component leads into the corresponding opening pattern in the plates 778, 779, which are in the aligned position. With the leads inserted in the funnel openings and their position substantially constrained, the presentation robot executes a predetermined series of oscillating movements moving the component body with respect to the constrained leads. The particular movements are typically empirically determined for each particular component type.A typical series of movements is to repetitively oscillate the component body in four directions X, X, Y, Y, 1 32 inch away from the central inserted position. The oscillatory movements are adapted to flex the leads in one direction for example, X to a minimum yield point, i.e., the deflection at which the lead no longer springs back or returns to its initial position, and then to flex the lead in the opposite direction X from the central position to the opposite yield point.The yield point depends on factors such as the stiffness of the leads and is empirically determined. The leads may then be flexed in the direction Y, Y normal to the first series of movements. More than one series of movements may be required. Upon completion of the oscillatory movements, the leads will be aligned at averaged positions within a few thousandths of an inch from the nominal, perfectly aligned condition. It is desirable to minimize the required oscillations, to minimize the risk of breaking the leads. An aspect of the invention is the flexibility of the system to accommodate virtually any component and straighten its leads sufficiently that the insertion robot can successfully insert the component into the circuit board. Because the funnel openings comprising the opening patterns in the plates 778, 779 are over sized relative to the circuit board opening, the presentation robot is able to insert components into the plates 778, 779 which could not be successfully inserted into the circuit board by the insertion robot because one or more of the component leads are misaligned. FIG. 25 is a block diagram illustrative of the control system for architecture controlling the operation of the component insertion system shown in the perspective view of FIG. 12. In this embodiment, the system controller 850 provides overall control over the entire system. As described above, controller 850 comprises a personal computer station, such as the IBM personal computer, with associated memory, display and keyboard functions, enabling a system operator to interface with the system. In the embodiment, the presentation robot 900, as well as the insertion robot, comprise commercially available systems, and each system includes a robot controller, indicated in FIG. 25 as presentation robot controller 955 and insertion robot controller 960. The system controller is interfaced with the presentation robot controller 955, the insertion robot controller 960 and the clinch system indicated generally as block 965 through interface device 980. Each robot controller is programmed to accept instructions from the system controller 850, and to provide responsive information to the controller 850, via the interface device 980. The component clinch system 965 is directly controlled by the system controller, as described above. The board transfer and locating system, indicated generally in FIG. 25 as block 970, is controlled by the presentation robot controller 955. Thus, controller 955 is adapted to control the operation of the conveyor motor and the air cylinders actuating the clamp mechanism for fixing the location of the board bracket 768 at the insertion station 772. The presentation robot controller 955 is further adapted to control the operation of the lead straightener and cutting system. Thus, the controller 955 controls the function of the clamp and shear cylinders, and monitors the sensors 790, 791. The controller 850 indirectly controls the operation of the presentation robot 900, by interfacing with the robot controller 955. The system controller 850 is programmed to perform such functions as system start up control, data handling, system sequencing, error fielding, and controlling the teaching sequences for the insertion robot and the clinch system. The presentation robot controller 955 includes a peripheral disc drive memory unit, enabling the controller to perform several program functions. The controller 955 controls the movement of the presentation robot arm and end effector, in its part retrieval function. The controller 955 also controls the straightener and cutter operation sequence, and the handshaking performed with the insertion robot to ensure that the operations of the two robots are properly sequenced to avoid collisions. The above functions are performed by one program for the controller. By another program, the controller 955 communicates with the system controller 850 and controls the operation of the board locating and transfer system.Another program is employed for the manual teaching sequence by which the pick up location and presentation location of each component are loaded into memory.Another program performs safety functions to provide for safe operation following emergency stop o the system, and verification that the position data which has been learned by the controller are regionally correct, i.e., not in conflict with the insertion module. The insertion robot controller 960 is adapted to carry out a component pick up and insertion function. The movement of the insertion robot arm and the operation of the end effector are under the control of controller 960.Other functions performed by this controller include part presence sensing, tactile insertion sensing, handshaking with the clinch system, teaching of the insertion movements and testing. It is to be understood that the control system is provided with insertion program information for each type of board to be processed. The information defines the sequence by which the various components are to be inserted into the board and their respective board locations. The control system is further provided with information defining the location of each part feeder device and the appropriate component type provided at that feeder device. The system controller 850 is adapted to coordinate the operation of the above described components of the component insertion systems. A series of steps occurs in sequence. First, the BLT system is operated to convey a circuit board to the insertion station and clamp it in the insertion position. The presentation robot selects the first component from the appropriate feeder device and delivers it to the component presentation station, where the leads are straightened. The presentation robot then releases the component and moves away to select the next component The insertion robot then grips the first component at the presentation station and the leads may then be sheared. The insertion robot then inserts the component at its predetermined location on the board.While the insertion robot grips the component in its inserted position, the clinching element clinches predetermined leads of the component. The insertion robot then returns to the presentation station to grip the next component. These steps are repeated until all the components on the board have been inserted. The BLT system then conveys the finished board away from the insertion station and delivers a new board to the station. For the sake of clarity, specific details concerning the interfacing of the respective controllers 850, 955, 960 have been omitted. For similar reasons, specific details concerning air valves, motor drivers and peripheral devices for interfacing the controller 850 with the various elements of the board transfer and locating system 970 and the lead straightening and cutting system 975 are omitted. Such details will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the above description. An improved component insertion system has been disclosed. The system provides the flexibility of adapting to insertion of different products without mechanical retooling, by changing the controller software. The system enhances the productivity of circuit board assembly lines by substantially reducing the time required to convert the line from assembly of one type of circuit board to another type. Moreover, because retooling is not required, the capital expenditures required to implement an assemble line capable of assembling a plurality of circuit board types may be reduced. It is understood that the above described embodiment is merely illustrative of the many possible specific embodiments which can represent principles of the present invention. Numerous and varied other arrangements can readily be devised in accordance with these principles by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
