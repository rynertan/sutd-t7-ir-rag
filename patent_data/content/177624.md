# Absorption refrigeration process.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a highly efficient refrigeration system and process, driven by low grade heat and operated at pressures substantially below atmospheric, which provides cooling at temperatures generally within the range from about 12 C to about 15 C. Solutions of normally liquid, mutually soluble compounds, having substantially different boiling points, are employed as refrigerant and absorbent. Typically, the absorbent comprises a distillation bottoms fraction containing from about 65 to about 95 mol. of the higher boiling compound and the refrigerant com prises a distillation overhead fraction containing from about 93 to about 99 mol. of the lower boiling compound. Multi effect modes may be employed. This invention also relates to the use of the aforesaid novel refrigeration system is a modified refrigeration system and process, employing two absorption refrigeration cycles in series operation, the first cycle comprising an ammonia aqeous ammonia system and the second cycle comprising the aforesaid novel absorption system and process. Heat pumped up in the first ammonia cycle is absorbed in the second cycle by refrigerant at the coolant temperature achieved therein.
