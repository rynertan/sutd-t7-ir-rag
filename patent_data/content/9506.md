# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING TABLE SALT.

## Abstract
A process for efficiently producing common salt rich in mineral components from the sea water by utilizing natural energy without using petroleum or electricity. According to this process, the sea water is allowed to gradually flow down from an upper portion of a liquid permeable hollow tower, whereby the sea water is concentrated to prepare the brine. To the brine is then added the salt such that components having small degree of solubility are precipitated and sedimented. The resulting brine is then introduced into an evaporator to distill off the water at atmospheric temperature and under atmospheric humidity conditions thereby to obtain the common salt.
