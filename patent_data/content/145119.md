# Apparatus for ion implantation.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a system for implanting ions into a target element including a source arrangement 410 for producing an ion beam a flight tube 421 a beam analyzing arrangement for receiving the ion beam and selectively separating various ion species in the beam on the basis of mass to produce an analyzed beam and a beam resolving arrangement disposed in the path of the analyzed beam for permitting a preselected ion species to pass to the target element. The source arrangement includes an ion source arc chamber 460 having a font plate 495 with a rectangular exit aperture 496 having a width of about five millimetres and a length of 110 millimetres.
