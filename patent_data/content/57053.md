# Helicopter rotors.

## Abstract
The helicopter rotor includes a powered blade fold mechanism adapted to have a rotor blade 16 between a spread operational position and a folded position and at least one lock pin 17 to lock the blade 16 in its spread position. The mechanism includes a rotary power source and a mechanical linkage 23, 25 having an over centre position and adapted so that energisation of the power source in one direction moves the linkage 23, 25 through the over centre position to withdraw the lock pin 17 and fold the blade 16 , and energisation in the other direction moves the blade 16 to the spread position and re inserts the lock pin 17 automatically as the linkage 23, 25 moves back through its over centre position. Lock means may be provided to lock the blade in pitch and, in one embodiment particularly adapted for use in an articulated rotor, the lock means includes pitch, flap and lag locks.
