# Pump control surge reliever system.

## Abstract
A surge control system for a liquid transporting pipeline in cluding a pump. A two way surge reliever valve, preferably of the expansible tube type, is located in a by pass line around the pump and the jacket or control pressure is maintained at the level of an accumulator connected to the pipeline downstream of the pump. The inlet line to the accumulator has a restriction so that when the pump starts, pressure build up in the accumu lator and control jacket is retarded, allowing by pass flow from the downstream side of the pump back to the upstream side. The discharge from the accumulator is full capacity with a one way check valve so that when the pump is stopped, liquid is drawn from the accumulator first to alleviate column separa tion in the downstream pipeline and then to draw down the jacket pressure to allow by pass flow around the pump to further alleviate column separation.

## Description
PUMP CONTROESURGE RELIEVES SYSTEM BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Hydraulic pressure surges are commonly encountered in liquid pipelines when the flow velocity is changed suddenly, as when a blocking valve is closed, or a pump is started up or shut down. Such pressure surges can be either positive or negative in magnitude, depending on the location in the pipeline. Conventional surge relief valves or systems are adapted to protect the pipeline against positive pressure surges only, by diverting a portion of the flowing liquid from the pipeline into a low pressure zone, such as a reservoir or holding tank. Systems of this type are shown in the followingUnited States patents Patent No. 3,911,941 October 14, 1975 Gerbic, et al. Patent No. 3,972,364 August 3, 1976 Brumm Patent No. 3,933,172 January 20, 1976 Allen Patent No. 4,261,387 April 14, 1981 Cohn Patent No. 4,282,757 August 11, 1981 Cohn Patent No. 4,340,079 July 20, 1982 Smith, et al. Negative pressure surges are generally alleviated by injecting air into the pipeline by using a vacuum breaker to relieve a vacuum within the pipeline or by injecting liquid into the piepline from a pressurized vessel, such as an accumulator. A complete surge relief system would require one or more of the aforementioned devices or systems at both the upstream and downstream sides of the equipment that produces the change in flow velocity.However, this would be very costly and would require considerable space to accommodate the equipment. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION It is an object of this invention to provide a surge control system that protects against both and negative pressure surges. It is a further object of this invention to provide a surge relief system that functions also as a pump control means. It is a further object of this invention to provide a surge relief system that protects both the suction and discharge sides of a pump. Other objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the description to follow, particularly when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawing. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A by pass Une is provided around a pump in the pipeline, and installed in the by pass line is a control valve, preferably of the expansible sleeve type wherein a flexible tube is stretched over a barrier across the flow passage to open when pressure in the flow passage exceeds a surrounding pneumatic jacket pressure. The jacket is normally at pump discharge pressure through an accumulator, which is connected from the pipeline downstream of the pump. Hence, in normal operation, both the jacket and the by pass line are at pump discharge pressure and there is no by pass flow. One line from the accumulator to the pipeline is of large capacity and has a one way check valve enabling discharge flow only. A load line connected from the pipeline to the accumulator has a metering valve so that flow to the accumulator is retarded.Hence, at pump start up, pressure in the by pass line increases rapidly, while that in the control valve jacket is retarded by the metering valve. This allows by pass flow from the discharge of the pump back to the suction side, both to relieve a positive pressure surge and to accommodate the pump discharge until same can be accommodated in the pipeline itself. On pump shut down, the liquid is drawn rapidly from the accumulator to fill the void of the liquid column separation and if the void is not satisfied, the low pressure in the pipeline will continue to draw down the jacket pressure until the control valve is opened for by pass flow from the suction side of the pump. This by pass flow is further beneficial in that it relieves the positive pressure surge that occurs on the suction side of the pump as a result of pump shut down. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING The drawing is a schematic illustration of the surge relieving pump control valve system of this invention installed in a pipeline. DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The surge relieving pump control system 10 of this invention is adapted for installation in a pipeline 12 including a pump 14 to which liquid is delivered from the incoming pipeline 16 at some pressure, such as from the liquid head of a storage tank 18 or from a pump not shown further upstream.Tapped into the pipeline from the suction side 16 of the pump 14 to the discharge side 12 is a by pass line 20, 21 in which is installed the control valve 22, which is preferably of the expansible tube type. In the control valve 22, a slotted sleeve 24 is positioned within a housing 26 and has a central circular barrier 28 and upstream and downstream flow slots 30 and 32. A resilient sleeve 34 is stretched over the central barrier 28 to form a seal therearound, and a jacket or control chamber 36 contains a control pressure fluid which prevents flow through the valve 22 unless and until the pressure in the by pass line in either direction 20 or 21 overcomes the pressure in tis jacket 36 by enough to expand the resilient sleeve 34 away from sealing engagement with the central barrier 28. Valves of this type are typified by that shown in U.S. Patent No. 3,272,470 grantedSeptember 13, 1966 to A. U. Bryant. The pressure in control jacket 36 is determined by pressure in an accumulator 38 which is connected to the pipeline at 40 downstream of the pump 14.The accumulator 36 preferably has a liquidgas separator, such as the bladder shown, wherein the pressure of the liquid 50 is transmitted to a gas 52 which, in turn, is connected to the control valve jacket 36 by means of a transfer duct 54. The pipeline accumulator communicating conduit means 40 includes a large capacity discharge pipe 56 having a oneway check valve 58 that enables flow only from the accumulator 38 to the pipeline 12. Also connected to the accumulator is a load line 60 which includes a variable metering valve 62 so that flow from pipeline 12 to the accumulator 38 is retarded to the extent determined by the setting of the metering valve 62. Finally, a small relief valve 64 is provided at the liquid connection to the accumulator 56 for a purpose hereinafter to be described. Operation Prior to pump start up, the accumulator 38 is nearly empty and it, as well as the control valve jacket 36 are at pipeline pressure. Then, as the pump starts, the liquid column in the pipeline begins to accelerate and flow through the accumulator connector line 40 commences. The check valve 58 closes, and flow is restricted to the metering valve 62 while flow at the by pass line 21 downstream of the pump 14 reaches pump discharge pressure very quickly. Initially, therefore, the pressure in the jacket 36 is less than that in the discharge side by pass line 21 and the control valve 22 opens to recirculate liquid back through line 20 to the suction side 16 of the pump 14.Then, as the accumulator continues to fill slowly, the pressure in the jacket 36 also continues to increase to reduce the differential pressure between the by pass line 21 and the jacket 36 so that flow through the control valve 22 is throttled, reducing the recirculating flow to the suction side of the pump 14 as pipeline flow accelerates. Finally, when jacket pressure reaches pump discharge pressure, there is no by pass recirculation. Hence the by pass line 21 functions not only to relieve a pressure surge in the pipeline 12 but functions as a pump control valve to recirculate fluid in a constant delivery pump which may, on start up, exceed the capacity of the pipeline to handle it. When the pump is inactivated, it winds down quickly and the momentum of the liquid column in the downstream pipeline tends to cause column separation at the pump discharge side, which would leave a vacuum behind the column. The creation of a vacuum is dangerous in that it subjects the pipeline to collapsing from external forces and in addition leaves a void for a positive surge return of the liquid column. As the pump discharge pressure falls, the air pressure in the accumulator gas side 52 and the control jacket 36 forces the liquid out of the accumulator 38 quickly through its large discharge line 56 and check valve 58 in an effort to avoid liquid column separation. If the liquid from the accumulator 38 alone fails to fill the void of liquid column separation, the low pipeline pressure continues to draw down the pressure in the accumulator 38 and the control valve jacket 36, so that the pressure in the jacket 36 is less than that in the by pass line 20, same having been built up by positive pressure surge at the suction side of the pump 14 upon stoppage thereof. When this differential pressure becomes sufficient to overcome the tube tension of the expansible tube 34, the control valve 22 opens to by pass liquid from the suction side 16 and around the stopped pump 14, both to relieve the positive surge at the suction side of the pump and to alleviate the negative surge and column separation at the discharge side.As long as the liquid momentum is sufficient to cause liquid separation, the pressure in the jacket 36 should be at or below atmospheric pressure and the static pressure should be sufficient to overcome the tube tension and keep the control valve open for by pass flow around the pump. When the liquid flow finally slows to a condition such that the differential pressure between the by pass line 20 and the control jacket 36 is no longer sufficient to overcome the tube tension, the control valve 22 will close. Finally, in the event that the control valve 22 does not provide sufficient by pass flow to prevent liquid separation in the downstream line 12, the very low pressure in the jacket 36 will allow the control valve 22 to open in the event of a subsequent positive surge caused from liquid rejoining, i.e.surging back to fill the void, and to relieve the positive surge by enabling by pass flow through lines 21 and 20 back into the suction side 16 of the pump. Referring now to the small relief valve 64 mentioned above, this may be set at a pressure just below the noflow head of the pump to limit the pressure in the accumulator 38 and, therefore, the control valve jacket 36.As a result, if there occurs a blockage in the pipeline that would cause the pump discharge pressure to approach the noflow head of the pump it would overcome the limited jacket pressure and open the control valve 22 to recirculate a small flow and prevent the pump from stalling. While this invention has been described in conjunction with a preferred embodiment thereof, it is obvious that modification and changes therein may be made by those skilled in the art to which it pertains without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention, as defined by the claims appended hereto.
