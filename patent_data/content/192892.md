# Method of making an infrared reflective glass sheet.

## Abstract
This disclosure is directed to a method of making an infrared reflective glass sheet. The method has the following steps. The glass sheet formed of soda lime silica glass is selected. The glass sheet is heated to a temperature in a range from 900 to 1100 F. If desired, the sheet glass selected may be selected at the time it is being manufactured in a glass manufacturing operation and it would have upon leaving a process such as a float process a temperature in a range of 900 to 1100 F. An organic metallic ion containing, chlorine free compound is applied to a surface of the glass sheet. Application of this compound forms a metallic oxide seal coating on the surface of the glass sheet. A coating of tin oxide is applied to the metal oxide seal coating. The coating of tin oxide is formed from the decomposition of butyltin trichloride. The glass sheet is cooled to room temperature after application of the metal oxide seal coating and the tin oxide coating thereon.
