# Sampler and an apparatus for hydrogen determination in molten metal.

## Abstract
A sampler for the hydrogen analysis of molten metal includes a vacuum tubular body having a wall formed from an inorganic refractory material, and provided at one end thereof with a suction end which is melted upon immersion in molten metal to form an opening for the suction of molten material. The tubular body contains an inner tube connected to the suction end, formed from a hydrogen permeable material and defining a cavity in which the molten metal drawn thereinto through the suction opening can be solidi fied into a sample having a predetermined shape. The tubular body defines therein a hollow space located con tiguous to the inner tube for collecting the hydrogen released from the sample during its solidification. An apparatus for the hydrogen analysis of molten metal, including such a sampler, is also disclosed.
