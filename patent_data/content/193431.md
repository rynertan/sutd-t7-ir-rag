## Description
Description Monoclonal Antibodies Against Chlamydial Genus Specific Lipopolysaccharide The present invention is onoclonal antibody L2I 6 which specifically binds to a chlamydial genus specific epitope. This epitope, shared by all members of the genus chlamydsa, is located on the liposaccharide LPS antigen the gylolipid group antigen of these obligate intracellular procaryotes. The chlamydial LPSs process at least three distinct antigen domains, two of which are shared by other gram negative organisms. The third, the chlamydial genus specific epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody L2I 6 of the present invention, is common only to members of the genus chlamydia. Part of the difficulty in producing monoclonal antibodies to the chlamydial LPS is that quantitative yields of chlamydial LPS are achieved only when elementary bodies EBs are first reduced and alkylated and then extracted by the hot phenol water procedure.These observations are possibly peculiar to chlamydiae and may reflect the rather unique outer membrane and cell wall structure of these organisms. For example, it has been previously shown that C. trachomatis lacks detectable muramic acid, indicating the absence of a typical peptidoglycan structure. The ability ofChlamydia organisms to maintain a rigid shape in the absence of peptidoglycan is believed to occur via the major outer membrane protein. The chlamydial major outer membrane protein constitutes 65 or more of the total outer membrane protein and is known to be extensively cross linked in the EB form of the parasite by disulfide bonds.The experiments described in the examples indicate that these covalent bonds which occur between this structural protein prevent its complete partitioning into the hot phenol phase, resulting in atypical extraction results i.e., large interface phase . Examination of interface material revealed primarily large amounts of major outer membrane protein and LPS. Reduction of EBs with dithiothreitol significantly increases the yield of chlamydial LPS Table 1 . Chlamydial antigens are immunopathogenetic of disease in many animals and man. However, the characterization of these antigens has been, until recently, most difficult due to the inability to obtain sufficient amounts of uncontaminated antigens.The discovery of hybridema technology makes possible the preparati on of monoclonal antibodies to chlamydia without the need of extensive purification of chlamydial antigens. The present invention discloses one such monoclonal antibody, L2I 6, which specifically binds to the chlamydial lipposaccharide epitope.

Note that the LPS of each chiamydia strain was immunoreactive with monoclonal L2I 6 lanes a through f however, none of the LPSs of the other gramnegative organisms bound monoclonal antibody L2I 6. In wells containing whole cell lysate preparations, approximately 20 g of protein was electrophoresed.Wells with isolate LPS contained ca. 5 g dry weight of LPS. Specific Disclosure Hybridoma supernatants produced as described inExamples 1 and 2 were screened for immunoreactivity to chlamydial antigen s with a solid phase radiometric assay in which were employed HeLa 229 cells infected with the C. trachomatis serovars L2, D, and G B serogroup and R and I C serogroup and C. psittaciMn. Hybridoma supernatants were screened in duplicate against chlamydia infected HeLa cells that had been treated with 0.05 M NalO4 in 0.05 M acetate buffer or acetate buffer only. Treatment with Na 104 was included in the initial screening assay to identify protein Abinding monoclonal antibodies that were reactive against the periodate sensitive antigen s . The results of a typical assay are shown in Fig. 1. Fig.1., lane b, the reactivity of the hybridoma L2I 6 supernatant fluid is shown. The L2I 6 monoclonal antibody reacts with HeLa cells infected with C.psittaci Mn and C. trachomatis serovars L2, D, G, H, and I, but not the infected HeLa cell control. The immunoreactivity of this group reactive epitope is destroyed by prior treatment wiht NaIO4 Fig. 1, lane b . The L21 6 monoclonal antibody is an IgG3 molecule, as determined by double immunodiffus ion analyses in which subclass monospecific qoat anti mouse IgG antiserum is used. The genus specific eptiope recognized by monoclonal antibody Is21 6 and a typespecific epitope located on the chlamydial major outer membrane protein appeared to be immunodominant determinants when Formalin fixed EBs were used as the immunogen.Using the procedures described in the examples, 16 hybridomas secreting chlamydial antibodies were obtained from three different BALB c spleen NSl cell fusions. Six 37 of these hybridomas recognized the periodate sensitive, genus specific epitope, and 8 48 reacted with an L2 serovar specific epitope located on the major outer membrane protein of the organism. All but one of these monoclonal antibodies were of the IgG3 subclass. Location of the genus specific epitope on chlamydial LPS. Immunoblotting analysis was used to determine whether the genus specific epitone recognized by monoclonal antibody L2I 6 was located on chlamydialLPS Fig. 2 . The following preparations were electrophore and immunoblotted i L2 EB whole cell lysate without lanes a and a and with lanes b and b proteinase K treatment and ii phenol waterisolated chlamydial LPS lanes c and c , phenon water extract of the cellular debris recovered after harvesting chlamydiae from infected L cells lanes d and d , and an uninfected L cell control lanes e and e . Several points can be made from the data presented in Fig. 2.First, the silver stained polyacrylamide gel shows that the phenol water isolated chlamydial LAPPS lane c is homogeneous and migrates as a low molecular weight molecule Mrr 10,000 . As shown in the accompanying immunoblot lane c , monoclonal L2I 6 intensely bounds to isolated chlamydial LPS and to material in the whole cell and digested lysates which had similar electrophoretic mobility. These findings show that the genus specific epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody L2I 6 is located on chlamydial LPS. Specificity of monoclonal antibody L2I 6 for chlamydial LPS. The findings presented above show that monoclonal antibody L2I 6 recognized an epitope located on chlamydial LPS. Although preliminary data indicates that this epitope was common to the genus Fig. 1 , the reactivity of monoclonal antibody L2I 6 against each of the 15 C. trachomatis serovars and seven different C.psittaci strains were examined by microimmunofluorescence Table 2 . Antibody L2I 6 reacted at an identical end point titer of 1 320 with the acetonefixed EBs of all chlamydiae tested. For purposes of comparison, the specificity of monoclonal antibodiesL2I 45 and L2I 10 that recognize type specific and subspecies specific epitopes located on the major outer membrane protein, respectively, are also shown in Table 2. Monoclonal antibody H5332 was included as a negative control. These serological data show that antigenic determinant seen by antibody L2I 6 was common to chlamydial isolates of both species. ExamplesExample 1 Organisms. Chlamydia trachomatis was grown inHeLa 229 cells or suspension cultures of mouse L 929 cells, and EBs were purified as previously described inCaldwell et al Infect. Immun. Vol. 31, pp 1161 1176 1981 . Antisera. Hyperimmune rabbit polyclonal antisera against purified EBs were prepared as previously described in Caldwell et al Infect Immun Vol. 35, pp 1024 1031 19.82 . The immunoglobulin G IgG fraction of the ant isera was isolated by adsorption to protein A Sepharose CL 4B Sigma Chemical Co., St.Louts, Mo. . Hybridoma production. Female BALB c mice 3 to 4 weeks of age were immunized with 4.0 x 108 inclusion forming flits of Formalin killed L2 EBs mixed with 0.1 ml of Freund complete adjuvant. Approximately 0.1 ml of adjuvant EB emulsion was administered intramuscularly in a hind leg of each mouse on day 0.On days 14, 21 and 28, 4 x 108 inclusion forming units of Formalin killed L2 serovar was injected intravenously. On day 31, mice were sacrificed and their spleens were removed. Bybridomas of BALB c spleen tells and murine myeloma cells P3 NS 1 Ag 4 1 were prepared as described by Barbour et al. J. Exp. Med., Vol. 156, pp 1312 1324 1982 . Example 2 Selection and cloning hybridomas. Supernatants from wells containing growing hybridomas were assayed by a solid phase radicimmunoassay in which chlamydialinfected HeLa 229 cells were used. Briefly, 5 x 108 229 cells suspended in 100 1 of Eagle minimal essential medium in Hanks balanced salts and supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum were seeded into wells of a 96 well, flat bottomed tissue culture trav. After 24 h, the medium was removed and six rows of 12 wells were infected with Chlamydia psittaci Mn and C. trachomatis strains L2 434 Ru, D UW 3 Cx, a UW 57 Cx, H UW 4 Cx, and I UW 12 Ur. A single row of cells was not infected and served as a HeLa cell control.At 42 h postinfection, the medium was removed from wells containing cells infected with the Mn strain and the L2 serovar. These monolayers were then fixed with 1 ml of absolute methanol for 10 min and washed twice with 1 ml of 30 mM NaPO4 0.15 M NaCl 0.02 NaN3,DB 7.2 phosphate buffered saline PBSi azide . One milliliter of PBS azide was added to wells containing fixed cells, and the trays were then incubated at 370 in 5 CO2 for an additional 24 h. At this time, the remaining monolayers non LGV strains and uninfected control cells were fixed and processed as described above. For screening of chlamydial antibody, supernatant fluid 100 1 from wells containing proliferating hybridomas was inoculated onto fixed HeLa monolayers that were infected with the different chlamydial strains and incubated for 2 h at 370C on an orbital shaker. The fluid was then removed, and each well was washed three times with PBS azide for 10 min per wash. To each well 50 1 of 1251 labeled protein A 5 x 104 cpm was added, and the plates were reincubated at room temperature for 2 h on an orbital shaker.Finally, the iodinated protein A solution was removed, and the wells were washed as described above. The plate was then subjected to autoradiography with KodakX Omat AR film and a Lightning Plus intensifying screen for 12 to 18 h at 680C. Wells demonstrating bound protein A were identified, and the respective supernatant fluids were reassayed by immunoblotting to identify the immunoreactive component see below .Hybridomas of interest were then cloned twice by limiting dilution. Monoclonal antibodies were typed by double lmmunodi ffusion with subclass specific goat anti mouse InG antisera. Example 3 The effect of periodate treatment on chlamydial antigens was determined by the solid phase infectedcell assay described above. Methanol fixed, infectedHeLa 229 cell monolayers were treated with 100 1 of 0.05 M sodium metaperiodate in 0.05 M sodium acetate buffer pH S.5 or buffer alone a 40C for 24 h. The wells were washed with PBS azide and probed with antibody and 1251 labeled protein A as described above. Susceptibility to periodate oxidation was considered positive when periodate pretreatment inhibited or greatly reduced monoclonal antibody binding to chiamydia infected cells as determined by exposure of the autoradiograms. The microimmunofluorescence method of Wang,Excerpts, Medica, R.L. Nichols ed pp 273 288 1971 developed for the serilogical classification of C.trachomatis, was used to determine the chlamydial specificity of monoclonal antibodies. Isolation of chlamydial laPS. EBs were harvested from L 929 cells 42 h after infection. Purified EBs were washed twice with PBS, and the pellet was resuspended in glass distilled water and lyophilized.The dry weight of L2 EBs obtained from a typical harvest of 2 x 109 infected L 929 cells was between 60 and 65 mg. EBs 60 mg dry weight were initially extracted by the PCP method of Galanos et al, Eur. J.Biochem, Vol. 9, pp 245 249 1969 , followed by reextracting the PCP residue by the hot phenol water method of Westphal and Jann, Methods Carbohydr Chem.,Vol. 5, pp 83 91 1965 . The procedure was modified in that ultracentrifugation was extended from 3 to 16 h.Subsequently, EBs were reduced with 50 mM dithiothreitol Sigma in 20 ml of PBS for 30 min at 40C. One milliliter of 1.0 M iodoacetamide in PBS was added, and the mixture was kept at 40C for 1 h. The reduced and alkylated EB suspension was centrifuged at 30,000 x g for 15 min at 40C, and the EB pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of cold distilled water. This suspension was then lyophilized and weighed. The LPS from 32.6 mg dry weight of EBs treated in this manner was readily extracted by the hot phenol water method.The length of ultracentrifugation was again increased to 16 h.Example 4 Immunoblotting. An immunoblot procedure was used in which electrophoretic transfer was done in 25 mM sodium phoshate pH 7.3 at 27 V 0.9 to 1.0 A for 2 h at 170C to RAHY Millipore nitrocellulose paper with aTrans Blot cell Bio Rad Laboratories, Richmond,Calif. . After transfer, the nitrocellulose paper was incubated in 50 mM sodium phosphate 0.15 M NaC10 0.02 NaN3 containing 3 bovine serum albumin for 30 min.The nitrocellulose paper was then incubated with antiserum or monoclonal antibody diluted in PBS bovine serum albumin for 2 to 16 h on a rocker platform Rellco . The nitrocellulose paper was washed three times for 5 to 15 min with PBS, followed by incubation with 125I labeled protein A 5 x 105 cpm ml for 1 h at room temperature. The nitrocellulose paper was then washed in PBS, pressed between sponges, and air dried at 370C. Chlamydial LPS bound very poorly to nitrocellulose paper when buffers containing detergents Tween 20 or Nonidet P 40 were used, and therefore, detergent was omitted from all immunoblotting procedures. Autoradiography was done with Kodak x OmatAR film with a Lightning Plus intensifying screen at 680C for 4 to 12 h.Example 5 Isolation of chlamydial LPSs. The NalO4 sensitivity and the genus prevalence of the epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody L2I 6 indicates that the antigen is the chlamydial glycolipid antigen.Since the chlamydial glycolipid antigen is an LPS molecule, this example describes the isolation of the glycolipid antigen with LPS extraction procedures.Purified EBs were first treated with dithiothreitol, blocked r educed sulfhydryls with jodoacetamide, and then subjected these preparations to both LPS extraction procedures. A total of 0.625 mg of LPS 1.9 yield was recovered from 32.6 mg of reduced and alkylated EBs by the phenol water procedure Table 1 . However, even using reduced and alkylated EBs, we were unable to extract LPS by the Galanos procedure. Characterization of chlamydial LPS is summarized inTable 1. Parallel analyses of S. typhimurium Re LPS were done. Both LPSs and similar activities in aLimulus amoebocyte lysate assay. The KDO values were dissimilar. Although reproducible analytical figures were obtained, they did not indicate the true KDO content of the samples. Not only is KDO labile, it is known that the molar absorption of KDO varies considerably with the presence of substituent 11 .The low values obtained for total carbohydrates in chlamydial and Re LPSs by the phenol sulfuric acid method were at or below the limits of reliability for the assay. The test results were indicative of low hexose contents in both LPSt. Example 6s In order to determine whether this epitope was chiamydia specific or a determinant present on the LPS of other gram negative organisms, the immunoreactivity of antibody L21 6 against six chlamydial isolates, N.gonorrhoeae JS1, S. typhimurium, and Escherichia coil was tested by immunoblotting. Both whole cell lysate preparations and isolated LPS were analyzed for each organism. Additionally, several S. typhimurium strains which represented different LPS chemotypes were tested. These were S. typhimurium smooth, Ra, Rd2, and ReLPSs. Isolated smooth and rough LPS of E. coli 0111 B4 and mutant J5 were also tested. The silver stained profiles and their accompany immunoblot against monoclonal antibody L2I 6 are shown in Fig. 3. The LPS of each chlamydial strain reacted strongly with this antibody lanes a through f however, LPSs from N.gonorrhoeae, S. typhimurium, and E. coli were not reactive lanes g through q . In addition, isolatedLPSs of Coxiella burnetii phase I or II andRickettsia rickettsii did not react with antibody L2I 6 by immunoblotting. These immunological findings show that, at least for the limited number of extracellular and obligate intracellular bacteria examined, the genus specific epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody L2I 6 is unique to chlamydiae and is not shared by the LPS ofother gram negative bacteria.
