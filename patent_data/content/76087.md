# Method and apparatsu for forming a sliver.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for forming a sliver from a web of fibres leaving the upper part of a horizontally extending delivery roller 2 of a cotton type carding machine. The web is delivered downwardly from the upper part of the delivery roller into proximity with a surface of power driven selvedge support means, in one embodiment conveyors 9 and 10 . The surface of the selvedge support means moves at a level below the upper part of the delivery roller in a direction that is generally longitudinal to the delivery roller and into a sliver forming nip 15 . The downwardly travelling web passes through the nip and tension is applied to the web by the action of the nip. The sliver is delivered from the nip 15 and may pass directly to calender rolls 27 immediately downstream of the nip. If parts of the web should break, the selvedge support means will guide these back into the nip to regain normal running.
