# Cathode assembly for glow discharge deposition apparatus.

## Abstract
In a apparatus for glow discharge deposition, process gases are commonly introduced into a deposition chamber from a gas manifold 36 disposed upstream of a substrate. As the process gases are drawn across the surface of the substrate 11 , they are disassociated and recombined under the influence of an electromagnetic field developed by a deposition cathode or microwave generator. By providing a precathode system 62 upstream of the deposition cathode or microwave generator, a impurities in the process gases, b contaiminates from the walls of the deposition chamber and c initially disassociated and recombined process gas compositions may be deposited onto and collected from a collection plate disposed ustream of the substrate 11 . In this manner, the process gases subjected to the upstream electromagnetic field are more easily broken down by the deposition cathode and deposited onto the substrate in desired chemical combinations and compositions so as to provide improved electrical, chemical and optical properties. Also disclosed herein is the use of such a precathode assembly to aid in the high speed deposition of hologeneous, amorphous, powder free semiconductor material of uniform thickness across the entire width of the substrate.
