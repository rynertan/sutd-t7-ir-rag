## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Conventional corticosteroids, such as cortisone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, methylprednisolone, etc., are generally poorly water soluble and therefore not suited for intravenous administration. Several types of soluble C 21 derivatives of such steroids have been disclosed in the patent literature including dicarboxylic acid hemiesters, sulfobenzoates, sulfopropionates, sulfates, phosphates, and aminoalkanoyloxy derivatives. While solubilization can generally be attained quite readily using a variety of such pro moieties, most of the aforementioned derivatives possess other disadvantages limiting their utility as water soluble prodrugs. The term prodrug denotes a derivative of an active drug which is converted after administration back to the active drug.The pro moiety referred to in this application is the fragment attached to the steroid via an ester linkage and removed by ester hydrolysis in vivo. A major problem with many common derivatives is their solution instability. Dicarboxylic acid hemiesters of corticosteroids such as succinate esters, for example, are marketed commercially as lyophilized powders for reconstitution prior to injection due to their solution instability see, for example, E.R. Garrett, J. Pharm. Sci., 51, 445 1962 and J. Med. Pharm. Che. 5, 112 1962 B.D. Anderson and V. Taphouse, J. Pharm. Sci., 70, 1981 R. Yamamoto, S. Fujisawa, and M. Kawamura, Yakugaku Zasshi, 91, 855 1971 B.D. Anderson, et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 72, 448 1983 .Corticosteroid 21 aminoalkyl carboxylate derivatives reported in the literature also undergo rapid hydrolysis in aqueous solution M.Kawamura, R. Yamamoto, and S. Fujisawa, Yakugaku Zasshi, 91, 863 1971 . Certain derivatives which do appear to exhibit better solution stability suffer from other disadvantages. 21 sulfate esters, for example, may not be readily converted to the active parent drug in vivo as suggested by the fact that the 21 sulfate of hydrocortisone is inactive in mice M. Kawamura, R. Yamamoto, and S. Fujisawa, YakugakuZasshi, 91, 871 1971 meta sulfobenzoate esters which have been reported as having improved solution stability M. Kawamura, R. Yamamoto and S. Fujisawa, ibid, French Patent Derwent No. 76199 U are frequently not highly water soluble and thus may have limited utility as injectable prodrugs. Phosphate esters may in some cases possess the requisite solubility, solution stability, and bioconversion rates but exhibit other disadvantages.Several undesirable features of phosphate esters are apparent 1 Phosphate esters are often difficult to purify and are frequently very hygroscopic. 2 The stability of phosphate esters is optimum above pH 7 where other modes of drug degradation may be a problem. Glass surfaces are also more likely to delaminate in alkaline conditions resulting in particulate problems.3 Precipitation of free corticosteroid due to the limited amount of hydrolysis which does occur may limit product shelf life. Solubilization of free corticosteroid due to micelle formation by the intact prodrug is a desirable feature which phosphate esters exhibit to only a limited extent. 4 Concentrated solutions of phosphate esters of corticosteroids exhibit accelerated reaction velocities due to micelle formation, 1im ting shelf life in concentrated solutions G.L. Flynn and D.J. Lamb, J. Harm. Sci. 59, 1433 1970 . Sulfopropionate esters of corticosteroids have also been reported as readily water soluble and as having improved solution stability Derwent AccessionNo. 27789 C . Sulfoacetate esters are also known Derwent 9453F .The present invention provides a novel class of ester prodrugs of corticosteroids which do not possess the typical glucocorticoid activity.FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention is novel ester prodrugs of steroids and formulations thereof which have pharmacologically useful propecties.

Illustrative examples of such acid addi p q tion salts are inorganic salts such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, or phosphate, or organic salts such as acetate, malonate, succinate or sulfonates. Quaternary ammonium salts of compounds ofFormula I containing a terminal amine group may be depicted as follows where R11 isEMI5.1 wherein Y , p, X , q, R12 and R13 have the meanings defined in FormulaI, alkyl has from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and Ra represents an anion, for example R8 is I, Br, Cl, CH3SO3 or CH3COO. To form acid addition salts of the compounds of Formula I containing a terminal amine function, said compounds are treated with suitable pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acids by standard procedures. Suitable inorganic acids are, for example, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, sulfuric or phosphoric acids.Suitable organic acids include carboxylic acids, such as, acetic, propionic, glycolic, lactic, pyruvic, malonic, succinic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, stearic, ascorbic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, benzoic, hydroxybenzoic, phenylacetic, glutamic, glutaric, cinnamic, salicylic, 2 phenoxybenzoic or sulfonic acids such as methane sulfonic, sulfonilic, toluenesulfonic, or 2 hydroxyethanesulfonic. The quaternary ammonium salts are formed by contacting said compounds with a suitable akylating agent such as dimethyl sulfate, dimethyl sulfate, or a suitable alkyl halide such as methyl or ethyl chloride or methyl or ethyl bromide or methyl or ethyl iodide. Also included within the scope of this invention are base addition salts of compounds of Formula I wherein R11 is CH2CH2COOH, Y CH2 n X CH2 mS03W or Z CH2 r9 which are obtained by treating the acid of Formula I with pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic bases by standard procedures. Suitable inorganic bases are, e.g., those of alkali metal hydroxides, such as potassium, sodium, magnesium, and aluminum. Suitable organic bases are physiologically acceptable compounds containing tertiary amine functional groups, e.g., choline OH , trishydroxymethylmethylamine, triethanolamine, or trialkylamines such as triethylamine. The aryl moiety in the R3 group OCOaryl is attached to the carbonyloxy moiety through any of the available ring carbon atoms of said aryl moiety. Any reference herein to compounds of Formula I includes pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof. The compounds of the present invention are useful in treating the following diseases and injuries head trauma, spinal trauma, septic or traumatic shock, stroke, and hemorrhagic shock. In addition utility in cancer as well 2S other disorders or Dhysiological phenomenon dependent on angiogenesis such as embryo implantation antifertility , arthritis, and atherosclerosis is exhibited with these compounds co administered with oral heparin or systemic heparin fragments see J.Folkman, et al., Science 32, 719 725 1983 . The compounds of the present invention possess substantially none of the typical glucocorticoid effects. The compounds of the present invention can be administered orally, intramuscularly, intravenously and by suppository, and the effective dosage range is 60 to 100 mg kg day. Additionally, a dosage regimen of using a loading dose of about 30 mg kg followed by a repetitive as needed maintenance dose of about 15 mg kg may be desirable.The compounds of the present invention may be coadministered with low doses of glucocorticoids. For the treatment of cancer including head tumors and other conditions dependent upon angiogenesis a preferred dosage range is 10 to 100 mg kg day and the preferred route of administration is orally, by suppository or intramuscularly. The utility of the compounds cf the present invention can be demonstrated in various test models as follows For head trauma, mice are struck upon the head with a standard weight which is dropped from a set height. They are then dosed subcutaneously with the test compound. After one hour the motor abilities of the mice are assessed.Active test compounds promote improved motor activity relative to controls. For spinal trauma, see E.D. Hall and J.M. Braughler, Surg.Neurol. 18, 320 327 1982 and J. Neurosurg. 56, 838 844 1982 . Septic traumatic shock is demonstrated in a rat model whereby test com pound is administered and protection of the rats from the lethal effects of endotoxin is measured. For stroke, the carotid arteries of gerbils are ligated for a brief period after which test compound is aaministered subcutaneously. The behavior of the gerbils is observed after a recovery period, and gerbils receiving test compound display a more normal behavior after the recovery period. And for hemorrhagic shock, by published procedures used to evaluate glucocorticoids. The novel compounds of the present invention provide marked advantages over known steroids in that these novel compounds are highly water soluble which facilitates formulation of the compounds and permits long term storage of solutions of said novel compounds. The solution stability of these compounds is due to several features 1 The derivatives are highly soluble in the pH range 3 to 6 which is the pH range in which ester hydrolysis in aqueous solution is minimized. 2 Functional groups which may promote ester hydrolysis through any catalytic or substituent effect are sufficiently distant from the ester linkage that such influences are minimized. 3 The compounds self associate in concentrated solutions to form molecular aggregates which increase the shelf life of formulations by a retarding hydroxide ion catalyzed ester hydrolysis at high concentrations, and b solubilizing any parent steroid present in and resulting from the hydrolysis of a solution of a compound of the present invention. For storage of aqueous solutions of the compounds of Formula I the pH of their solution must be properly controlled. Ideally, the pH will be maintained at a level where the hydrolysis of the ester is at a minimum. This minimum depends to a certain degree on the chemical structure of the pro moiety, the formulation concentration, and the temperature of storage but in general will be at a pH of about 3 to 6 for the compounds of this invention. A pH of 4 to 5 is preferred for compounds wherein R11 is CH2CH2COOH. Most advantageously, buffers should be employed to maintain the pH at or. near the desired level throughout the shelf life of the formulation. Suitable buffers are those which are physiologically acceptable and exhibit sufficient buffer capacity in the pH range 3 6, e.g., acetate, citrate, succinate, or phthalate buffers and the like.The quantity of buffer used is determined by means known in the art and will depend on the pH desired, the concentration of the solution, and the buffering capacity of the buffer. The concentration of the solution stable formulations of the compounds of Formula I depends on the activity level of and the ultimate dose of parent steroid desired. In general the stability of the formulations increases as the concentration of novel ester increases.In essence the solution stable formulations may be as concentrated as viscosity properties permit or until the solubility of the novel ester is exceeded. Sterile aqueous solutions of the compounds of Formula I typically will contain other components such as preservatives, anti oxidants, chelating agents, or other stabilizers. Suitable preservatives can include benzyl alcohol, the parabens, benzalkonium chloride, or benzoic acid. Anti oxidants such as sodium bisulfite, ascorbic acid, propyl 3,4,5 trihydroxy benzoate, and the like may be employed. Chelating agents such as citrate, tarzrate, or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA may be used. Other additives useful as stabilizers of corticosteroid prodrugs e.g., creatinine, polysorbate 80, and the like may be employed. Sterile aqueous solutions of compounds of Formula I can be administered to the patient being treated, i.e., a warn blooded mammal, intramuscularly or intravenously or orally. Additionally conventional solid dosage forms of the compounds of Formula I can be administered orally to the patient being treated. For example, capsules, pills, tablets or powders of the compounds of Formula I can be formulated in unit dosage forms incorporating conventional fillers, dispersants, preservatives and lubricants. Also suppositories providing a sustained release of a compound of Formula I can be formulated using conventional inert materials such as biodegradable polymers or synthetic silicones. The compounds of the present invention are prepared by various routes using conventional procedures. For convenience in describing the preparation of the compounds of Formula I the symbol St is employed to represent that portion of Formula I as depicted by FormulaVII. PREPARATION OF COMPOUNDS OF FORMULA I WHEREIN R11 IS Y CH2 n x cH2 ms03H When Y is oxy, i.e., 0 , equimolar amounts of an intermediate of the formula 02N C 6H4 OCOO CH2 X CH2 SO3H Formula VIII wherein C6H4 is 1,4 phenylene and n, m, and X have the meanings defined in Formula I, and a parent steroid of the formula StOH wherein St has the meaning defined in Formula VII are reacted in a dry aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran THF , dimethylformamide DMF or dimethylsulfoxide DMSO , in the presence of an acylation catalyst such as dimethylaminopyridine DMAP or N methylimidazole. Although the reaction may be performed at room temperature it is convenient to gently warm the reaction mixture to about 500 600C with stirring until all the activated carbonate ester is consumed.The product is purified by pouring the reaction mixture into water with the pH adjusted to 4 and washing with an organic solvent, e.g., ether or ethyl acetate. It is then concentrated by removing the solvent and further purified either as the free acid or as an appropriate salt by crystallization and or chromatography. When Y is a bond equimolar amounts of an intermediate of the formula H C CH2 n X ICH2 m S 3H Formula IX wherein n, m, and X have the meanings defined in Formula I with a 21 iodo or 21 Omesyl derivative of the parent steroid which may be represented respectively by the formulas St Iodo Formula X and St O mesyl Formula XI whereinSt has the meaning defined in Formula VII and mesyl means S 02 CH3 are reacted. When the 21 iodo steroid derivative is employed the reaction proceeds at room temperature, whereas when the 21 0 mesyl steroid derivative is used the reaction is heated to about 600 70 C. The reaction is carried out in a dry aprotic solvent such as DMF in the presence of a sterically hindered tertiary amine such as diisopropylethylamine. The product is isolated by diluting with water, adjusting the pH to 5, washing with an organic solvent, suitably ethyl acetate, and further purifying by recrystallization or chromatography.
