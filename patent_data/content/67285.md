# Self initializing ring counter.

## Abstract
The ring counter of this invention is self initializing and is operable at a clock frequency corresponding to four gate delays and comprises a plurality of master of slave flip flops, in which this high speed capability is attained by using non inverting feedback between the first and last flip flops and by operating the master and slave of each in com plementary fashion without requiring the use of a com plementary clock signal. The non inverting feedback takes advantage of the inherent delay between the response of the complementary outputs of each flip flop.
