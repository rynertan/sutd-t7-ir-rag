It will be understood that for desired insulation the walls of the chamber 120 for receiving the cuvette 110 must be cow plementary to the external configuration of the cuvette ane suc is the case in tlic asscmbly, and hence it will be understood that the chamber 120 is coincident with the line defining the exterior of the cuvette and hence no physically distinct chamber 120 is shown. Further, it will be understood that since the cuvette 110 is of irregular confuguration, the insulator 116 is made in two picces, suitably shaped and assombled together, to provide the intimate contact betwoon the insulator and the cuvette for desired insulation. Electrical circuitry, as indicated by cjeneral numerical designation 130, is included and, is in intimate physical contact with the under side of the transparent cuvette 110 to provide intimate thermal and optical contact between the clectrical circuitry and cuvette.The electrical circuitry 130, as may be best understood from the diagrammatical illustration of FIG. 10, may include a monolithic chip 132, a film heating resistor 133 for jheating the cuvette 110 and seeded culture growth medium received therein to a physiological temperature for the cultivation of microorganisms such as bacteria, a film temperature calibrating resistor 134, a temperature sensing element such as thermistor chip 135 for controlling the heat resistor 133 and thereby controlling to the desired physiological temperature the heat applied to the cuvette and the seeded culture growth medium received therein, a first photoemitter and photodetector pair El and D1, a second photoemitter and photodetector pair E2 and D2, and additional photoemitters E3, E4 and E5.For example, the substrate 131 may be of a melamine fiberglass base, a porcclainized metal base, or a ceramic substrate.

The monolithic chip 132 also may be suitably bonded to the substrate 131 and interconnected to the other electrical elements via bonding wires in the manner well known to those skilled in the Åart. The assembly 100 also includes an optical system for providing an external indication of the growth of the micro organis ..s or bacteria within the closed interior of the selfsufficient incubation assembly. This may be best understood by reference to FIGS. 5 and 10, where three electro optical guides G1, G2 and G3 are shown in physical and electro optical registration and communication with the photoemitters E3, E4 and E5, respectively, and communicate illumination emanating from these photoemitters to the exterior of the assembly to provide an external visual indication of the detection of growth of microorganisms or bacteria deep within the closed exterior of the assembly.The electro optical light guides G1,G2 and G3 may be supported and positioned, for example, by suitable complementary shaped guideways formed in the insulator 16. Referring now more specifically to the structure of the transparent cuvette 110, as may be noted generally from reference to FIGS. 2 and 4, the cuvette is comprised of a top 160 and a bettom 170 each made of suitable transparent material, such as a suitable transparcnt moldable plastic, and adhered together by a suitable adhesive or bonding operation the irregular configuration and closed container aspect of the cuvette 160 require, for cost and convenience of manufacture, that it be made ill to pieces, namely the top 160 and bottom 170,and thereafter asscmbled.Referring specifically to FIGS. 12 15 and the specific structure of the cuvette top 160, it will be noted that the top is provided with a pair of upwardly extending intake or entrance galleries 161 and 16.9 and a pair of shorter and upwardly extending exiting or venting galleries 163 and 164. It will be understood that entrance gallery and venting gallery 161 and 163 are associated with cuvette cell lll and that entrance gallery 162 and venting gallery 164 are associated with cuvette cell 112 hence, the entrance gallery 161 and venting gallery 163 operate as a pair and the entrance gallery 162 and venting gallery 164 operate as a pair.As may be best understood by reference toFIG. 15, and with regard to cell 112, the upper surface of the cell, provided by the lower surface 165 of the top 160, is inclined or angled to insure venting upon filling of the cell with a seeded culture growth liquid medium and in a manner explained in detail later, reflector 166, such as a strip of shiny metal or tape or other suitable surface treatment, is suitably adhered to the top 165 to reflect light from the photoemitter E2 to the photodetector D2 it will be understood that cell 111 is also provided with an inclined top and a reflector 167 as shown in lIC. 1.1 tm,t reflector 1G7 i for reflccting light from the photocmitter El to the photodetector D1. The cuvette bottom 170, as showii in detail in FIGS. 14 19, is provided with a plurality of integrally formed, upwardly extending w 171 176 defining cuvelte cells 111 112 and the space 112 thercbetween. The bottom 170 further includes upwardly extending integrally formed eniscus collimating lens 181 and 182 and integrally formed meniscus collecting lens 183 and 184.It will be understood that the collimating lens 181 and collecting lens 183 are associated with cuvette cell 111 and hence operate as a pair and that collimating lens 182 and collecting lens 184 are associated with cuvette cell 112 and hence operate as a pair it will be still further understood that collimating lens 181 and collecting lens 183 operate or function in cooperation with reflector 167 and that collimating lens 182 and collecting lens 184 operate or function in cooperation with reflector 16 6 as shown in FIG. 25.As is further shown in FIG. 19, the respective axes of the collimating and collecting lens 182 and 184 are disposed at suitable angles with respect to the reflector 166 shown in dashed outline but shown where the reflector 166 is positioned upon assembly of the cuvette top and bottom such that a beam or ray of light collected by lens 182 from photoemitter E2 is focused on the reflector 166 and the reflector reflects the received light along the axis of the collimating lens 184 to the photodetector D2, similarly with regard to collimating and collecting lens 181 and 183, reflector 167 and photoemitter El and photodetector D1. The bottom 170 is provided with locating pins 188189 to establish proper registration of the cuvette 110 with the electrical circuitry 130. The self sufficient incubation assembly may also be provided with a cap indicated by general numerical designation 150 and which cap is shown in detail in FIGS. 6 8. Generally cap 150 has a dual function, namely it seals or closcs the cuvette 110 upon a seeded liquid culture growth medium being received thercin for microorganism cultivation and also interconnccts the electrical circuit y 130 with the battory . Specifically, and referring to FIGS. 6 S, the cap includes a top 151, a plurality of radially disposed and downwnrdly extonding members 153, 15i and 155 for being received i.n correspondingly radially dips posed and downwardly extending slots formed in the top 102 of the asse,llbl 100 as may be best seen in the upper lefthand portion of FIG. 8. Additionally, the cap 150 is provided with a pair of downwardly extending plug mcmbers 157 and 158 for respectively entering and sealing the entrance galleries 161 and 162 as is also shown in FIG. 2.It will be further understood that the cap 150 has two positions, the first position with the arrow 159 of the cap FIG. 6 not aligned with the arrow 119 provided on the top of the assembly as shown in FIG. 1 and in this position the cap does not interconnect the electrical circuitry 130 with the battery 144 and the cap is not locked to the assembly 100.However, upon the seeded liquid culture medium being placed in the cuvette 110 and operation of the assembly being desired, the cap is rotated 1800 to align the arrows 159 and 119 and the cap is inserted into the top portion of the assembly whereupon the plug members 157 and 158 seal the entrance galleries 161 and 162 and the downwardly extending member 154, as shown in FIG. 2, is provided with an inwardly extending slot or groove which is engaged by the outwardly extending resilient member 152, as shown, to loci the cap 150 to the top 102 oE this assembly 100 to close and seal the asscmbly for incubation. Additionally, upon the arrows 159 and 119 being aligned and the cap inserted into the top of the assembly, the downwardly extonding member 155, as may be best seen in FIG. 4, engages a spring meunted electrical conncctor 181 to force the conncctor into engagement with the battery 144 to interconncet the batiory 144 through the clectrical connector 183 to the electrical circuitry 130 to energize the circuit and conanen e incubation. loeferring again to FIG. 2, and to the upper lefthand portion, it will be understood that the top 112 is formed inwardly to provide a receptacle 200 which is provided at its bottom with an integrally moldcd pair of funnels 201 and 202 aligned vertically with the entrance galleries 161 and 162 of the cuvette 110. The operation of the self sufficient incubation assembly 100, and. the present invention will now be described for use as a urinary tract infection kit although it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention is not so limited but is of general use. As is further known to those skilled in the art, bacteria can be classified into two groups,Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria. As is further known to those skilled in the art, urinary tract infection is caused primarily by Gram negative bacteria such as Ecoli however, as is also known, urinary tract infection can be caused by Gram positive bacteria. While virtually all sampled urine contains some bacteria, the levels of bacteria of concern are those levels which are referred to in the art as clinically relevant levels of bacteria, for example 100,000 bacteria per ml, and it is the early detection of the presence of such clinically significant levels of bacteria that is the purpose of urinary tract infection detection apparatus in order that appropriate antibiotics can b prescribed aiid taken before the onset of a virulent bacterial infection. As is further known to those skilled in the art, Gram negative bacteria reproduce facter than Cram positive bacteria,Gram negative bacteria reproducing approximately every 20 minutes while Gram positive bacteria reproduce approximately every 0 minutes, that is at approximately one half the rate of Gram negative bacteria.Hcnce, with this reproduction information, bactoria in a urine sample from a urinary tract suspected of having an infection may be cultivated at a physiological temperature, such as for example 370C or 98.60F, for a given period of time such as for example approximately four hours, and the bacteria level present at the RTI ID 13.27 beginning of the period per ml may be compared with the bacteria present per ml at the end of tfie period and the presence or absence of a clinically significant level of bacteria can be determined. In addition, by knowing the respective reproduction rates of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria, and by comparing the respective growths of such bacteria over the time interval, the logical determination of the presence of a Gram negative infection or of a Gram positive infection can also be determined or clinically inferred. As is further known to those skilled in the art, the growth of bacteria in a sample, such as a seeded liquid culture growth medium, over a given period of time can be determined or measured by the use of a photometer such as a turbidity meter.At tlie beginning of the time interval, the optical density of the sample can be measured by passing a transilluminating beam or ray of light through that sample and the encrgy los due to light scattering of the beam can be measured and recorded. Dacteria, as is known, upon growth or reproduction scatters light and as bacteria in the sample reproduce or proliferate such as in response to cultivation, more light is scattered thereby further incrcasing the optical density of the sample and hence at the cnd of the time interval the transilluminating beam or ray can again be passed through the sample and the increased encrcJy loss caused by increased optical density or light scattering can again be measured and compared vis a vis the earlier measurement.The difference in energy level of the light beam can be used, empirically, and particularly knowing the reproduction rate of the bacteria present, to prpvide a measurement of bacteria growth in the sample over the time interval. It will be further understood that circuitry embodied in the monolithic chip 132 and the photoemitter and photodetector pairs El Dl and E2 D2, in combination with the collimating and collecting lens and reflectors of the transparent cuvette 110 function as a photometer or turbidity meter. Referring now specifically to the operation of the present. invention when used in a urinary tract infection kit, it will be presumed that a urine sample has been taken from a urinary tract suspected of having a urinary tract infection, that the urine sample has been diluted in a suitable liquid culture growth medium, such as eugonic broth, to seed the broth, that the cap 150 of the assembly 100 has been removed, and that the seeded liquid culture growth medium has been poured into the receptacle 200 where it flows through the two funnels 201, 202 where it substantially divides and entcrs into the cells 111 and 112 of the transparent cuvette 110. It will be understood that cell 111 has been prcconditioned to grow only Gram positive bacteria by having a Gram negative inhibitor placed therein such as by coating the walls of cell 111 with sodium aside powder which, as kiiown to those skilled in the art, inhibits the growth of virtually all Gram negative bacteria. However, cell 112 has not been so peconditioned and hence boLh Graze negative and Gram poitive bacteria will grow in cell 112.The cap 150 will taken be placed into the receptacle c 200 with the yarrows 119 and 159 aligned to initiate operation of the assembly by energization of toe electrical circuit 130 as taught above.It will be understood that tlle monolithic chip 132 of the electrical circuitry 130, FIG. 10, lila, have a suitable circuit embodied therein to cause all of the photocmitters E3, E4 and ES to be temporarily activated, or activated in a predetermined sequence, to provide indication to the user that the selfsufficient incubation assembly is functioning thereafter such photoemitters will be extinguished and bacteria cultivation com nenced and continued for a time intcrval. As is further known to those skilled in the art, to provide significant turbidity measurements at the beginning and end of the time interval, the photometer or turbidity meter must be baselined to provide appropriate measurement references against which future measurements may be measured or compared for significant results. Accordingly, the electrical circuitry 130 may be suitably baselined for significant measurements. Referring to FIG. 9, there is shown such baselining circuitry, indicated by general numerical designation 220 which may be used for such baselining, although illustrated as a block diagram in FIG. 9, it may be embodied in the monolithic chip 132 of FIG. 10 in a manner kno .n to those skilled in the art.The baselining circuitry 220 is a dual channel circuit including channel 230 associated with cuvette cell lll and channel 240 associated with cuvette cell 112.Channel 230 includes the series connection of the photoemitter El, photodetector D2, amplifier Al, switching network S1, threshold comparator Tl, start stop logic 232, counter 231, digital to analoy converter 236 and amplifior A2 similarly, the channel 2.10 includes the series connected components as shown.Additionally, the baselining circuit includes the threshold comparators T3 and T4 connected to the decoder 250 which in turn is provided witch three outputs as shown, for providing one of three binary outputs indicative of the bacterial conditions shown, namely no infection, Gram negative infection, or Gram positive infection. Continuing from abovc, it will again be presumed that the circuitry 130 has been energized by the battery 144 duc to the closure of the cap 150 and now the operation of the baselining circuitry 220 and the decoder 250 for providing the bacterial infection indication shown will be described.With regard to baselining channel 230, upon energization the switching network S1 assumes state S1 whereupon photoemitter El has no output and hence photodetector D1 has no input and therefore no output this lack of output will be reflected to amplifier Al and threshold comparator T1 will signal the start stop logic 232 to initiate counting which is then converted, digital to analog by the converter 236, boosted by amplifier A2, and reflected in a gradually increasing light level emanating from the photcemitterEl.At such time the evoked response of the photodetector D1 reaches the preset level of threshold detector T1, the start stop logic is signalled to stop counting thus freezing the output level of the photoemitter El and channel 230 is now baselined similarly, channel 240 is also baselined to the preset level of the threshold detector T2.At the conclusion of the cultiva tion time interval, for example approximately four hours, which tine elapse is built into the circuitry of tic monolithic chip 132 in a manner known to those skilled in the art, the switching network SWl assumes state S2 and the evoked response of the photodetector Dl in response to the output of the photoemitter El transilluminating the cuvette cell 111 is conslected through amplifier Al to threshold comparator T3 and compared with its proset threshold level and if the later evoked response of the photodetector Dl falls below the threshold of threshold comparator T3 a binary 0 signal is transmitted to the docoder 250 to indicate the absence of clinically significant Gram positive bacteria growth in cell 111. However1 if the evoked response of the photodetector Dl is at least equal to or greater than the preset threshold of threshold comparator D3, a binary 1 signal is transmitted to the decoder 250 to indicate the presence of clinically significant Gram positive bacteria growth in cell 111. Sinilarly, threshold comparator T4 is preset to send a binary 0 or 1 signal to the decoder 250 to respectively indicate the absence of clinically significant levels of Gram negative and orGram positive bacteria growth in cell 112 or the presence of clinically significant levels of Gram negative and or Gram. positive bacterial growth in cell 112.It will be understood that the preset threshold levels of the respective threshold comparators will be preset empirically and in accordance with the recognized respective reproduction and growth rates of Gram positive andGram negative bacteria, for example the preset threshold of threshold comparator T4 of channel 240 will be approximately twice the preset level of throshold comparator To of channcl 230 since it is known that Gram negative bactoria grow at appreximatel twice the rate of Gram positive bactoria. The dccoder 250 will interpret or decode the binary 1 or 0 signals received from the respective threshold comparators T3 and T4 to provide an indication of bacterial growth in accordance with the algerithm, sometimes referred to in the art as a truth table, set for in FIG. ll. It will be further understood that the algerithm or truth table of FIG. 11 will also be embodied in suitable circuitry included in tie monolithic chip 132 of the electrical zircuit 130. Referring now to the decoder algorithm of FIG. 11, upon the decoder 250 of FIG. 9 receiving the binary 1 from the output of cell 111 and a binary 0 from the output of cell 112, this will be interpreted and the appropriate photoemitter E4 illw.rinated to indicate the presence of clinically significant levels of Gram positive bacteria in the urine sample. Upon the decoder receiving a binary p from cell 111 and a binary 1 from cell 112, this will be interpreted by the decoder 250 to indicate the presence of clinically significant levels of Gram negative bacterial and photoemitter E4 will be illuminated to provide such indication.Should a binary 0 be received from both cells, this will be decoded to indicate the absence of any clinically significant infection and photoemitter E3 will be illuminated to provide such visual indication. However, it is possible for the decoder to receive a binary 1 from both cell 111 and cell 112 and, as indicated in FIG. 17, this is interpreted or decoded by the decoder 250 to indicate the presence of clinically significant levels of Gram positive bacteria.This results from one of two possible situations and the following logic one possibility is that Gram positive bacteria were pr ent in such large quantity or experienced such large growth dui ing cultivation as to exceed both the preset threshold level of threshold comparator T3 of the Gram positive cell 111 and the preset threshold level of the threshold comparator T3 of theGram positive and or Gram negative bacteria cell 112 the other possibility is that there were m mixed bacteria pres nt, indicating the possibility of a mixed infection, and that the growth of the gram positive bacteria in cell 112 exceeded the threshold of threshold comparator T3 and that there was cither mixed or Gram negative bacteria growth in cell 112 sutficient to exceed the presct threshold of threshold comparator T . In cuch event, as known to those skilled in the art, trcatment for Gram positive bacteria or Gram positive infection is indicated. It will be noted from FIGS. 2, 4, and 5, and from FIG. 10 where cuvette 110, cell 111 and cell 112 are shown in dashed outline, that the electrical circuitry 130 and the temperature control element 135 are in intimate physical contact with the cuvette 110 specifically the underside thereof.Hence, the temperature of the temperature control element 135 will be substantially the same as the temperature of the cuvette and the seeded culture growth medium contained therein whereby improved temperature control of the medium is provided, and the heat of operation of the electrical circuitry 130 will supplement the heat applied by the heating resistor 133 and battery 144 to the cuvette 110 and the seeded culture growth medium received therein whereby the energy required to be supplied by the battery 144 will be less than would be required were the electrical circuitry 130 to be located externally of or the cuvette and not in intimate physical contact therewith. Referring now to FIG. 20, there is shown an altcrnate embodiment of the present invention itcluc1iny a transparent cuvette indicated by general numerical designation 210 in conbiioation with an electrical circuit indicated diagrammatically by general numerical designation 230. Tlie cuvette 210 is pro vided with a bottom portion 211, shown in cross section, and including transparent sidewalls and bottom as shown, and being open. at the top, but which r. ay be provided with a transparcnt top portion substantially the same as one half of the top 1u0 of FIGS. 12 15 and provided with entrance and venting galleries such as galleries 1G1 and 1G3 of FIG. 12, such top not being shown in FIG. 20 for clarity of presentation. The transparcnt cuvette bottom 212 may be provided with integrally formed optical elements such as integrally formed meniscus collimating lens 212 and integrally formed meniscus collecting lens 214 and with their respective axes aligned as indicated by the arrows 215 and 216 of FIG. 20 whereby no reflector is required.The electrical circuit 230, indicated diagrammatically, is functionally substantially the same as the circuit 130, particularly as illustrated in FIG. 10, and insofar as is pertinent to an understanding of the alternate embodiment of FIG. 20 may be provided, inter alia, with a photoemitter 231 and photodetector 233 in intimate optical contact with a respective lens 212 and 214 as illustrated, and a heating resistor indicated diagrammatically by numerical designation 237. As used in the specification and the appended claims, the expression intimate optical contact means that a photoemitter is positioned at a point with respect to its associated optical element to maximize the performance of the ray emanating from the photoemitter and passing through the associated optical element for the intended purpose of the ray and that a photodetector is positioned at a point with respect to its associated optical element to maximize the performance of the ray received and passing thorough the associated optical element for the intended purpose of the ray e.g. the photoemitter El of FIG. 10 and photoemitter 232 of FIG. 20 are positioned at the proper point along tile optical axis of the reslJective collimating lens 181 of the cuvette 110 and collimating lens 212 of cuvette 210 to maximize collimation of the light emitted by the photodetector for transilluminatingtheculture growth medium received by the respective cuvette 110 and 210 and the photodetector D1 ofFIG. 10 and the photodetector 233 of FIG. 20 are positioned along the optical axis of the respective collecting lens 183 and 214 to maximize the collection of the light transilluminating the culture growth medium and exiting the respective cuvette 110 or 210 for photometric measurement. It willvbe further understood by those skilled in the art that many modifications and .variations of the present invention may be made without departing from the spirit and the scope thereof.
