# Device for displaying three dimensional images.

## Abstract
In a device for displaying three dimensional pictures, N with N 2, 3, 4.... recorded images corresponding to different spatial observation positions are displayed on one or more intermediate display screens 3, 4, 5, 82, 83, 84 . The device comprises a viewing screen 6 having lens elements 20, 30 via which corresponding picture segments of the recorded images are displayed. An optical coupling 8, 44 having a plurality of light conductors 8 exists between the viewing screen and the intermediate display screen s . The light conductors unambiguously associate groups of N corresponding picture segments with lens elements of the viewing screen. By means of the device, three dimensional pictures can be observed without further auxiliary means for the viewer.
