# Polyester of 6 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid, para hydroxy benzoic acid, terephthalic acid and resorcinol capable of readily undergoing melt processing to form shaped articles having increased impact strength.

## Abstract
A novel thermotropic polyester is provided which has been found to exhibit an optically anisotropic melt phase at a temperature which enables it readily to undergo melt processing to form quality moulded articles, fibres, etc., which exhibit substantial flexibility. For instance, moulded articles can be prepared having an unusually high impact strength, toughness and high extension in addition to other highly satisfactory mechanical properties. The polyester of the present invention contains recurring 6 oxy 2 naphthoyl and p oxvbenzoyl moieties in addition to terephthaloyl moieties and meta dioxyphenylene moieties in the propor tions indicated. Such meta dioxyphenylene moieties are non symmetrical in structure. The hydrogen atoms present upon the aromatic rings of these moieties optionally may be at least partially substituted as described . The wholly aromatic polyester is capable of forming the desired optically anisotropic melt at a temperature below approximately 350 C. and in a particularly preferred embodiment at a temperature below approximately 325 C.
