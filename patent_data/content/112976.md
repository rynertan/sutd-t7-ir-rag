## Description
The present invention relates to a DNA which, with distinct nucleotide sequence, shows complementarity to human interferon y referred to as IFN y hereinafter messengerRNA referred to as mRNA hereinafter and a recombinant plasmid containing the DNA. The DNA also codes for biologically active IFN y. The present invention also pertains to a microorganism containing the recombinant plasmid, Interferons referred to as IFNs hereinafter are proteins some of which are in glycosylated form with antiviral activity, discovered originally by Isaacs and Lindenmann in 1957. It is known that at least three types of IFN, namely IFN a, IFN 5, IFN y, are produced. Subsequent studies have indicated antitumor activity of the substances in addition to antiviral activity and hence a wide clinical application of these substances is expected.For instance, it has been reported that IFN may be effective against various viral diseases and malignant tumors. However, because of its species specificity, only the IFN of human origin can be applied to human beings. The use of the IFN has been quite limited because of difficulties in mass production. Only recently, recombinant DNA technology has been applied to the production of human IFN a and IFN B by microorganisms such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomvces cerevisiae. For the same reasons, development of technology to produce human IFN y is also in demand. To this end, a novel DNA and recombinant plasmid have been developed for producing human IFN y with ease and in large quantities. It has been reported that IFN y may have more potent antitumor activity compared to other IFNs lProc. Natl.Acad. Sci., USA, 77, 5928 5932 1980 . Recently, cloning and expression of an IFN y cDNA in Escherichia coli as well as the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA have been reported by Gray et al., Nature, 295, 503 1982 . However, possibility for the presence of IFN gamma cDNA sequence which differs from the sequence reported byGray et al., could not be ruled out. If present, the IFN protein coded for by such cDNA could manifest different biological activities and may be of great use for clinical application. In accorcance with the present invention, a DNA which shows complementarity to human IFN Y mRNA is preparea using human IFN Y mRNA as a template and a novel recombinant plasmid containing the DNA is prepared. In addition, the reco,.binant plasmid may be inserted into a host microorganism. The DNA and the recombinant plasmid may be used, inter alia, for amplification of human IFN Y gene in bacteria such as Escnerichia coli. Such bacteria will be useful for the production of human IFN Y in large quantities at low cost. The DNA and the recombinant plasmid of the present invention are prepared by the following general procedure. First, cytoplasmic RNA is extracted from human mononuclear cells induced by a T cell mitogen such as phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A Con A in the presence of a phorbol ester such as 12 O tetradecanoylphorbol 13acetate, mezerein or related compounds thereof. Alternztively, the RNA can be isolated from human T cells or humanT cell lines of the thymus, lymphoblasts and peripheral blood cells induced by other inducers such as Staphylococcal enterotoxin A SEA or B SEB or deacetylthymosin alpha . From this RNA, the human IFN gamma mRNA having poly A poladenylic acid is isolated. A double stranded DNA is synthesized, for example, by reverse transcriptase, with the mRNA preparation having high IFN gamma mRNA activity, as a template. A recombinant is obtained by inserting the synthesized DNA into a vector DNA such as Escherichia coli plasmid DNA by the technique of in vitro DNA recombination. Recombinant plasmids having the inserted DNA which shows complementarity to the human IFN Y mRNA are selected. Fig. 1 is a restriction enonuclease cleavage map of pIFNy G4 cDNA. cDNA of P69 reported by Gray et al. is also illustrated for comparison Fig. 2 represents the complete nucleotide sequence of the cDNA from pIFNy G4 and Fig. 3 illustrates the construction of the plasmid pHGYG4 which is used for the expression of the cDNA in monkey cells. Human mononuclear cells are isolated from lymphocytesrich platelet residues by centrifugation at 400 x g for 30 minutes on a Ficoll Hypaque gradient. The cells are treated with 5 ng ml of a phorbol ester such as 12 O tetradecanoylphorbol 13acetate for 2 hrs. Then a T cell mitogen such as PHA 5 g ml or Con A or the like is added and the mixture is kept at 370C for 20 to 40 hours. Cells are collected and disrupted, and the nuclei are removed. Entire cytoplasmic RNAs are extracted with, for example, phenol. Alternatively cells are disrupted, and both DNAs andRNAs are extracted with, for example, phenol. The DNAs are decomposed with DNAase and removed followed by extracting the RNAs. The thus extracted RNAs are dissolved in a salt solution of NaCl or KC1 at a high concentration such as 0.5M and put on a column of oligo dT cellulose to adsorb mRNA having poly A on the column. Elution is carried out with water, a salt solution at a low concentration such as 10 m Tris HCl buffer, or the like to isolate mRNA having poly A . The isolated mRNA is fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. IFN mRNA activity in each fraction is checked by determining interferon activity antiviral activity of the protein which is synthesized in oocytes of African claw toad Xenopus laevis after microinjecting a part of the mRNA in each fraction. The determination of IFN activity is carried out according to the method described in Japan J. Microbiol. 18, 449 456, 1974 . Then, a DNA showing complementarity to the mRNA is synthesized in vitro by a reverse transcriptase, which is obtained from avian myeloblastosis virus AMV , using, as the template, an mRnA having the highest interferon mRNA activity. The synthesis is carried out as follows. An mRNA is reacted at an appropriate temperature e.g. 41 C for an appropriate period e.g. 90 min. with oligo dT , 1gCl2 e.g. 5 mM , NaCl e.g. 30 mM , mercaptoethanol e.g. 5 M and Tris HCl buffer e.g. pH 8.0, 40 mM using a reverse transcriptase together with deoxyadenosine triphosphate dATP , deoxythymidine triphosphate dTTP , deoxyguanosine triphosphate dGTP and deoxycytidine triphosphate dCTP e.g. 0.5 mM as substrate. The thus obtained reaction product is subjected to deproteinization with, for example, phenol, and the template RNA is removed by alkali or ribonuclease treatment. Double stranded cDNA is synthesized by reverse transcriptase in a similar way as the synthesis of the first strand i.e. single stranded cDNA as describe above except that mRNA and oligo dT are not present. By usingEscherichia coli DNA polymerase I instead of reverse transcriptase, the double stranded cDNA can also be synthesized. The cDNA which is synthesized by the above described procedure is treated with nuclease 51 which can be obtained from Aspergillus oryzae in the presence of ZnC12 e.g. 1 mM , sodium acetate buffer e.g. 0.1 X, pH 4.5 , NaCl e.g. 0.2 etc. Alternatively, couble stranded cDNA can be synthesized as described by Land et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 9, p.2251 2266 1981 The single stranded cDNA is treated by terminal transferase with dCTP as substrate to add deoxycytidyl residues at the 3 end of the cDNA. After deproteinization, the elongated cDNA is incubated with oligo dG 12 18, reverse transcriptase, dATP, dGTP, dCTP and dTTP to synthesize the second strand. Reverse transcrip tase can be replaced by DNA polymerase I in this reaction. On this DNA, deoxyguanyl residues are elongated at both 3 ends of the synthesized DNA by incubating with a terminal transferase purified from calf thvmus in the presence of potassium cacodylate buffer e.g. pH 7.6, 0.14 M , Tris base e.g. 0.03 M , dithiothreitol e.g.0.1 mM , CoCl2 e.g. 1 mM and dGTP e.g. 1 mM at an appropriate temperature e.g. 37 C for an appropriate period e.g.. 20 min. . On the other hand, a plasmid DNA which is used as a vector DNA, e.g. Escherichia coli plasmid pBR322DNA Gene vol.2, p. 95 113 1977 or derivatives thereof is used. The double stranded DNA is inserted into a restriction site of the plasmid. For example, p321, obtained fromP. Berg, Stanford University which is a derivative of pBR322 Okayama Berg Molecular and Cellular Biology, vol. 2, p. 161 170 1982 is treated with Kpnf Klebsielle pneumoniae, Takara Shuzo Co. in a suitable solution, for example Tris HCl buffer e.g. pH 7.5, 6 mM , MgCl2 e.g. 6 mM , NaCl e.g. 6 mM , 2 mercaptoethanol e.g. 6 mM and 0.02 bovine serum albumin to cut a RpnI site in p321.Thereafter deoxycytidyl residues are elongated at both 3 ends in the same way as for the above described synthesized double stranded DNA by using dCTP instead of dGTP as substrate for the terminal transferase. Synthetic double stranded DNA and plasmid DNA which are chain elongated at both 3 ends as described above are incubeted at an appropriate temperature for an appropriate period with Tris HCl buffer e.g. pH 7.5, 50 mM ,NaCl e.g. 0.1 M , EDTA e.g. 5 mM , or the like to form hybrid plasmids Taniguchi et al, Nature vol.274, p. 223 225 1978 . Then, a transformable Escherichia coli strain, e.g. rscherichi2 coli X1776 Molecular Cloning of Recombi nant DNA, Scott, W. A. Werner, R. editors, Academic Press p. 99 114, 1977 is transformed by the hybrid plasmids by the method of Enea et al. J. Mol. Biol., vol. 96, p. 495 509, 1975 or the like. In the novel recombinant plasmid DNA thus obtained, there exists a vector DNA gene, e.g. 5 lactamase enzyme that destroys ampicillin gene derived from Escherichia coli plasmid pBR322. Therefore, the transformed Escherichia coli shows resistance to ampicillin. The following technicue is generally used to pick up a strain with a novel recombinant plasmid DNA having a gene which shows complementarity to the human IFN mRNA among these ampicillin resistant tDR strains. First, 32P labelled DNA is synthesized wit the RNA having IFN mRNA activity described above as a template and the DNA is hybridized with mRNA extracted, without induction by PHA therefore, IFN mRNA synthesis is not induced , from the human mononuclear cells by incubating at a high temperature e.g. 650C in a reaction mixture containing, for example NaCl e.g. 0.5 M . Then, the hybridized DNA Probe A and non hybridized DNA Probe B are separated by hydroxyapatite column chromatography.Next, filter fixed DNAs of transformants are hybridized separately with PRobe B or Probe A according to the technique of Grunstein Hogness Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. vol. 72, p. 3961 3965, 1975 and strains having a DNA hybridizable with Probe B but not or barely with probe A are discerned by autoradiography. Then, plasmid DNA is isolated from each of the discriminated strains and hybridized with mRNA having IFN mRNA activity by incubating at a high temperature e.g.53 C in the presence of 80 w v formamide, 0.4 M NaCl, etc. Since the mPNA hybridized wit cDNA portion of the plas d DNA from the above described strain can be retained on a nitrocellulose filter, whereas unhybridized mRNA can not under certain conditions refer to Example below andNygaard, A. P. Hall, B. D., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Cormun. Vol. 12, p. 98 104, 1963 , this mRNA can be recovered selectively from the filter at a high temperature e.g.60 C in a solution such as 90 . v v formamide and thereafter injected into oocytes of XenoDus laevis. When interferon is synthesized in the oocytes, the DNA used for hybridization must contain a DNA which is complementary to interferon mRNA and by this method, a recombinant plasmidDNA having a gene showing complementarity to the human IFN y mRNA can be isolated. Alternatively, a part of the known DNA sequence of IFN ï is synthesized and used as a probe for the screening.The probe DNA is synthesized by a conventional triester method JACS, 97, 7327 1975 and the screening is carried out by in situ hybridization essentially as described above. The cloned cDNA can be readily expressed in, for example, cultured monkey cells such as CGS 7 cells. Gulzman,Cell, 23, 175, 1981 . The novel recombinant plasmids of the present invention are used for the mass production of IFN Y by a microorganism such as Escherichia coli or eukaryotic cells. One specific embodiment of the present invention is illustrated by the following representative example.Example 1 Induction of IFN Y in human lymphocytes Human mononuclear cells are isolated from lymphocytesrich platelet residues Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A. 78 6 , 3469 3472 1981 by Ficoll Hypaque density gradient centrifugation at 400 x g. 6 x 106 ml mononuclear cells are treated wita 5 ng ml 12 O tetra ecanoylphorbol 13 acetate TPA obtained from Consolidated Midland in RPNI 1640 medium without serum Product of GIBCO for 2 hours. Then, 5 g ml purified phytohemagglutinin PHA is added. After keeping at 370C for 20 to 40 hours, the cells are recovered with a rubber policemen into a physiological saline solution buffered with sodium phosphate. About 4 x 109 cells are pelleted under centrifugation at 800 x g for 5 minutes and resuspended in a physiological saline solution buffered with sodium phosphate.Then, the suspension is dispersed into 80 ml of a mixture of 10 r ice cooled Tris HCl pH 7.5 containing lomM of ribonucleotide vanadyl complex S.L. Berger and C. S.Birkenmeier, Biochemistry 18, 5143 5149 1979 , 10 mMNaCl and 1.5 mM MgCl2 in 150 ml Corex tube. Nondiet P 40 distributed by SIGMA, USA is added to a final concentration of 0.3 v v and the mixture is centrifuged in a Sorvall GS rotor at 300 rpm for 5 minutes to remove nuclei. The super natant is put into a Corex tube containing 4 ml of 10 sodium dodecylsulfate, 4 ml of 2M Tris HCl pH9.0 and 2 ml of 0.25 M EDTA and immediately subjected to extraction with phenol. The extraction is repeated two times and RNA is deposited with ethanol. 250 mg of the thus obtained RNA is dissolved in 10 ml of 1 mM EDTA.After incubation at 650C for 2 minutes, 2.5 ml of a salt solution at a high concentration 0.5 X Tris HCl pH 7.5 , 1 M NaCl, 50 mMEDTA is added to the solution. The mixture is subjected to oligo dT cellulose column P L Biochemicals chromatography. Adsorbed mRNAs having poly A are eluted by a salt solution at a low concentration 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5 or by water to obtain 250 g mRNA having poly A. 2 Fractionation of mRNA by sucrose density gradient centrifugation The mRNA is deposited with ethanol and dissolved in 0.5 ml of 1 mM EDTA. After heating at 700C for 2 minutes, the solution is centrifuged at 26,000 rpm and 4 C for 19 hours in the Hitachi PRS 40 Ti Rotor in 5 to 25 sucrose density gradient prepared in a solution of 50 mM Tris HCl, 0.2 M NaCl and 1 mM EDTA. Ribosomal RNA is centrifuged with another tube for the use of size marker. The former is recovered in 15 fractions and IFN Y mRNA activity is measured in a part of the fractions. The results are illustrated in Table 1.Most IFN gamma mRNA activity is present in fractionNo. 8.

Protein is removed with phenol and RNA is removed by treating at 37 C for 15 hours with 0.3 N NaOH. Then, the cDNA is treated at 370C for 20 minutes with 2 units of terminal transferase product of BethesdaResearch Lab. in 30 l of reaction solution 2.65 g of DMA, 0.14 M potassium cacodylate, 30 mM Tris, 1 mM dCTP, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM CoCl2, pH 7.6 to add about 23 deoxycytidyl residues to the end of the cDNA. 3 p1 of 0.5 M EDTA pH 8.0 is added to stcp the reaction and protein is removed with phenol.Water layers are collected andDNAs are recovered by the addition of ethanol. 2.32 g of the thus recovered DNA is treated at 37 C for 1 hour with the reverse transcriptase reaction solution mentioned above except that the oligo dT is replaced with 1 ug of oligo dG 12 18 Collaborative Research Inc. to obtain 4.24 ug of double stranded DNA dsDNA . Then, 1.78 g of the dsDNA is treated at 37 C for 20 minutes with 1 unit of terminal transferase in 20 l of reaction solution 1.78 g of dsDNA, 0.14 M potassium cacodylate pH 7.6 , 0.03 M Tris HCl, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 rrM CoCl2, 1 mM dCTP to add about 31 deoxycytidyl residues to both 3 ends of the dsDNA. 4 Cloning of dsDNA In this step, 15.6 ug of plasmid p321 is treated at 37 C for 1 hour with Kpn Klebsiella pneumoniae OK8, product of Takara Shuzo Co. in 100 l of reaction solution 6 mM Tris C1 pH 7.5 , 6 mM MgCl2, 6 mM NaCl, 6 mM 2 mercaptoethanol, 0.02 bovine serum albumin to cut a xpn size in plasmid p321.The cut plasmid p321 is treated at 37 C for 20 minutes with 2 units of terminal transferase prod ct of Bethesda Research Lab. in 100 l of reaction solution 15.6 g of DNA, 0.14 M potassium cacodylate, 30 mM Tris NCl pH 7.6 , 1 mM dGTP, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM CoC12 to add about 35 deoxyguanines to both 3 ends of p321 DNA. Then, 80 ny of the thus obtained plasmid DNA and 30 ng of the dsDWA obtained in step 3 are incubated at 650C for 2 minutes, at 460C for 120 minutes, at 370C for 60 minutes and at room temperature for 60 minutes in a solution consisting of 20 mM Tris Hcl pH 7.5 , 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA to hybridize both DNAs. Escherichia coli X1776 ATCC 31244 is transformed with the hydrid DNA by the method of Enea et al. J. Mol. Biol., 96, 495 509 197zXl. About 5,500 of ampicillin resistant ApR strains are isolated. 3,200 strains thereof are chosen and the DNA of each strain is fixed on nitrocellulose filters in duplicate. Then, 6 strains which hybridize at 37 C strongly to a probe oligodeoxynucleotides labelled with 32 PO4, , 32 p TGCCAGGACCCATA, are selectd Grunstein Hogness method, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 72, 3961 1975 . The thus obtained 6 strains are subjected to the same screening method as above at 440C to obtain strongly hybridized plasmid which is named pTFNY G4. 5 ucleotide sequence of the plasmid, pIFNY G4 The cDNA insert of the plasmid pIFN7 G4 obtained above is digested by various restriction endonucleases and its cleavage map is illustrated in Fig. 1. The restriction enzyme cleavage map of the cDNA from plasmid P69 reported byGray et al. Nature, 295, 503 1982 is also presented inFig. 1 for comparison. One notable difference in these two cDNA clones is the presence of an additional Rsa I tproduct of New England Biolabs. U.S.A. site in the clone pIFNY G4 which is not present in the cDRA clone P69 reported by Gray et al. Next, the complete nucleotide secuence of the DNA which is likely to have the nucleotide sequence divergence is determined according to the Maxam Gilbert method Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A. 74, 560 564 1977 . The sequence is set forth in Fig. 2. Part of the sequence which corresponds to the reported N terminal region of the human IFN Y Gray et al., Nature, 295, 503 1982 is presented below.

The replaced amino acid is boxed in Fig. 2. In order to establish that the novel cDNA codes for biologically active human IFN Y, the cDNA was cleaved with Sau3 product of Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. and the DNA which encompasses the entire coding region of the IFN gamma mRNA was introduced into a plasmid pKCR O Hare et al.. Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A., 78, 1527 1981 as illustrated inFig. 3. The cDNA is linked downstream from the SV 40 early promoter to construct plasmid pHGyG4A. The plasmid DNA, pHG gamma G4A, was transfected intoCOS 7 cells by the procedure of McCutchan and Pagano, J.Natl., Cancer Inst., 41, 351 1968 . Seventy two hours after transfection, interferon activity in the culture medium was determined and the results are set forth in Table 2 below. As shown in Table 2, activity characteristic of human IFN gamma was produced in the medium which demonstrates that the cDNA in the novel recombinant plasmid, pIFNY G4, codes for humanIFN Y.
