# Apparatus for measuring the colour of a product.

## Abstract
Apparatus for measuring the colour of a product and method of calibrating same is used for colour grading of products such as fruits, vegetables and food products being processed. The apparatus employs a light source 15 for illuminating the product and means 18 for detect ing light reflected from the product to provide a signal that is a measure of the colour of the product. For calibra tion, a target 35 of known colour is moved in front of the light source and the signal resulting from the light reflected by the target is compared with a reference signal to generate a modifying signal. Means 36 are provided for automatic calibration of the apparatus whereby this modifying signal is stored and thereafter used to adjust all subsequent readout signals.
