# PYROMETER WITH SIGHTING WINDOW CLEANLINESS MONITOR

## Abstract
Coke guide and coke oven infrared pyrometer degrading is minimized to continuously permit better accuracy and reliability in hostile environment of coke mass and heat, dust and or dirt present in many coke plant areas. These benefits are obtained using production worthy pyrometer equipment having a purged pyrometer with any of three window cleaniness monitors to determine errors and automatically correcting for same through self calibration.
