# SELF ALIGNED SILICIDE BASE CONTACT FOR BIPOLAR TRANSISTOSELF ALIGNED SILICIDE BASE CONTACT FOR BIPOLAR TRANSISTOR R

## Abstract
A self aligned silicide base contact structure for a bipolar transistor, and a process for fabricating the structure are disclosed. The structure has four key elements a base region 36, a polycrystalline silicon emitter contact region 50, a spacer oxide 60 and 62, and a base contact 74 formed of metal silicide. The spacer oxide is an insulator that electrical ly isolates the side walls of the emitter contact region from the upper surface of the base region. The spacer oxide is a residual amount of oxide that is left on the side walls of the emitter contact region after anisotropic etching is used to remove most of a covering layer of oxide. The metal silicide base contact is created on an exposed upper surface of the base region, and is formed by first depositing a metal layer on the upper surface of the base region, and then heat treating. Where metal and silicon atoms are in contact, such as along the exposed upper surface of the base region, metal silicide forms.
