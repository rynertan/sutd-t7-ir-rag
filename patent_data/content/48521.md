# NOVEL FUNGUS OF MUCOR MIEHEI AND ITS USE IN OBTAINING A NEW MILK CLOTTING ENZYME

## Abstract
A novel fungus of the species Mucor miehei designated as NRRL 12268 and its variants and mutants capable of producing high yields of enzyme product with a high milk coagulating activity and low proteolytic activity and the enzyme product produced by growing under aerobic condi tions of a culture of Mucor meihei NRRL 12268 in a medium containing appropriate nutrients and recording the result ing enzyme, preferably free of lipase as well as a process for producing cheese by coagulating milk with the said enzyme.
