# Magnet assembly.

## Abstract
A magnet assembly 1 particularly for use in NMR apparatus comprises a first superconducting coil assembly A,A C,C for generating a first magnetic field and a second superconducting coil assembly D F for generating a second magnetic field. The second superconducting coil assembly D F is electrically connected in series with the first super conducting coil assembly A,A C,C . Each coil assembly A,A C, C D F generates magnetic fields where corresponding components are of substantially the same order of magnitude whereby a resultant, uniform magnetic field is generated in a working volume 3 . The second magnetic field opposes the first magnetic field externally of the magnet assembly 1 .
