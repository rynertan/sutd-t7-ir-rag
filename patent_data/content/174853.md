# Radiolabeled antibody fragments.

## Abstract
Methods and reagents for attaching radionuclide metal ions to antibody fragments are disclosed. A coupling agent is employed which contains a maleimidyl group linked, through a divalent organic moiety, to a group capable of forming a chelate complex with the radionuclide metal ion. Antibody fragments labeled with radionuclide metal ions by the disclosed procedure are useful for in vivo diagnostic or therapeutic applications.
