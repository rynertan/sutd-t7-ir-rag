# MANIPULATOR APPARATUS WITH ENERGY EFFICIENT CONTROL

## Abstract
Manipulator apparatus is provided with an energy effi cient control arrangement 100 . The control arrangement in a pont to point mode of operation utilizes a servo valve 18 to selectively admit fluid from a pressurized source at 22 to one end e.g. 14 of a cylinder 12 . A piston 10 is slid ably mounted within the cylinder and connected to move a manipulator arm that is movable in a plurality of axes. The servo valve is closed when a predetermined arm velocity is reached and a bypass valving arrangement 52 is opened to interconnect the ends of the cylinder. At a predetermined position of the manipulator arm, the control arrangement closes the bypass valving arrangement and the manipulator arm is decelerated as the arm approaches the desired final position. The pressurized source includes an accumulator 38 and two high pressure check valves 90, 92 that each connect a respective end of the cylinder to the accumulator when the pressure at the respective end of the cylinder ex ceeds the accumulator pressure to supply pressurized fluid at 44 to other axes of the manipulator.
