# Process for preparing a zeolite of the L type using organic templates.

## Abstract
A zeolite of the L type is prepared by crystallization from a reaction mixture aged at 70 to 260 C containing water, a source of silica or germania, a source of alumina or gallia, a source of potassium and optionally up to 40 mole percent of a source of sodium, based on total mole percent of potassium and sodium , and a salt of a tetraalkylammonium cation wherein at least two alkyl groups have more than one carbon atom. Most preferably the cation is tetraethylammo nium cation.
