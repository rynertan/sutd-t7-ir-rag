Still another aspect of the invention is the compounds represented by formula VII which are useful intermediates for making compounds of formula I .EMI3.1 where A is hydrogen or benzyloxy, and R1 and R2 are as previously defined. DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The broadest aspect of the present invention is the group of compounds represented by the formulaEMI3.2 or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, wherein R1 is alkyl of two to four carbon atoms and R2 is alkyl of three or four carbon atoms or R1 and R2 taken together with N formEMI4.1 wherein n is 0, 1, or 2 and R5 and R6 are each independently lower alkyl or hydrogen R3 is hydrogen or hydroxy R4 is hydrogen, lower alkyl, amino, or lower alkylamino. One preferred subgenus of compounds of formula I is that wherein R3 is hydrogen, particularly where R4 is amino. A preferred compound is that wherein R1 andR2 are each n propyl. Another preferred subgenus of compounds of formula I is that wherein R1 and R2 taken together with N formEMI4.2 where n is 1 and R5 and R6 are methyl. A particularly preferred compound is that wherein R3 is hydrogen andR4 is amino. As used in the specification and the appended claims, unless specified to the contrary, the following terms have the meaning indicated The term lower alkyl refers to a straight or branched chain monovalent substituent consisting solely of carbon and hydrogen, containing no unsaturation and having from one to four carbon atoms. Examples of lower alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, n propyl, i propyl, n butyl, i butyl, s butyl and t butyl. The term hydroxy refers to OH. The term alkylamino refers to an amino group which is mono substituted with a lower alkyl group as defined above. The term pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts refers to salts of the subject compounds which possess the desired pharmacological activity and which are neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable.These salts are formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid or phosphoric acid or organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid and the like. The term opthamologically accept able 1 means suitable for use in the eye. I.e., an opthamologically acceptable carrier does not cause irritation when administered directly to the eye. The term direct administration means administration directly to the eye of the subject, and excludes general systemic administration. Direct administration includes, without limitation, topical application of aqueous solutions and ointments, administration of controlled release devices, and subconjunctival injection. The term treatment as used herein covers any treatment of a disease in a mammal, particularly a human, and includes i preventing the disease from occurring in a subject which may be predisposed to the disease but has not yet been diagnosed as having it ii inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting its development or iii relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease. Certain compounds of formula I wherein R1 andR2 together with N formEMI6.1 where R5 and R6 are not identical may have geometric cis and trans isomers. The wavy lines are used to indicate that either the cis isomer, trans isomer, or a mixture may be used. The isomers may be separated by various methods, for example selective crystallization and column chromatography. Alternatively, the free base e.g., 3,5 dimethylpiperidine may be resolved before it is incorporated into the compound of the invention. The invention includes all geometric isomers of any assymmetric compound of formula I, as well as mixtures thereof. ADMINISTRATION AND FORMULATION Another aspect of the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions useful in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, migraine, and vasospastic disorders, particularly in the treatment of hypertension in a mammalian subject, comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I , or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic carrier.A therapeutically effective amount is that amount which is sufficient to cause the regression or inhibition of the progress of a disease, or to prevent the occurrence of a disease in a subject that is disposed to the disease but not yet diagnosed as having it. Thus, the level of the drug in the formulation can vary from about 5 percent weight W to about 95 W of the drug based on the total formulation and about 5 W to 95SW excipient. Preferably the drug is present at a level of about 10 W to about 70 . Useful pharmaceutical carriers for the preparation of the pharmaceutical compositions hereof can be solids or liquids. Thus, the compositions can take the form of tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained release formulations, solutions, suspensions, elixirs, aerosols, and the like. Carriers can be selected from the various oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, and the like. Water, saline, aqueous dextrose, and glycols are preferred liquid carriers particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, cellulose, talc, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, magnesium stearate, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol, and the like.Other suitable pharmaceutical carriers and their formulations are described in Remington sPharmaceutical Sciences by E. W. Martin, 15th Ed., 1975 . Another aspect of the present invention relates to a method for treating cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, migraine, and vasospastic disorders in a mammalian subject particularly human which method comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I , or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, to a mammal in need thereof. In the practice of the above described method of the present invention a therapeutically effective amount of the compound of formula I or a pharmaceutical composition containing same is administered via any of the usual and acceptable methods known in the art, either singly or in combination with another compound or compounds of the present invention or other pharmaceutical agents. These compounds or compositions can thus be administered orally, systemically e.g., transdermally, intranasally or by suppository or parenterally e.g., intramuscularly, subcutaneously and intravenously , and can be administered either in the form of solid or liquid dosages including tablets, solutions, suspensions, aerosols, and the like, as discussed in more detail above. It is preferred to administer compounds of formula I in which R3 is hydrogen orally.Parenteral administration is preferred for compounds of formula I in which R3 is hydroxy. The formulation can be administered in a single unit dosage form for continuous treatment or in a single unit dosage form ad libitum when relief of symptoms is specifically required. In view of the foregoing as well as in consideration of the degree of severity of the condition being treated, age of subject and so forth, all of which factors are determinable by routine experimentation by one skilled in the art, the effective dosage in accordance herewith can vary over a wide range. Generally, a therapeutically effective amount ranges from about 0.01 to about 10 mg kg body weight per day and preferably, for example, for antihypertensive use, from about 5 to about 50 mg kg body weight per day. In alternative terms, for an average 70 kg adult human subject, a therapeutically effective amount in accordance herewith would be, in preferred embodiments from about 0.7 mg to about 700 mg per day per subject, and preferably form about 35 mg to 350 mg per day per subject. The Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat SHR assay is an accepted test for antihypertensive activity. See, e.g.,J. Roba, et al., Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn., 200, 182 1972 . The compounds of the invention exhibit antihypertensive activity in the 5HR assay. Ophthalmic preparations are sterile products for either topical application to the eyes or instillation into the space cul de sac between the eyeball and the eyelids. Presently available ophthalmic preparations include solutions, suspensions, ointments, and controlled release preparations. Presently available treatments of eye diseases include topically applied ophthalmic drops, solutions, suspensions or ointment or their subconjunctival injection. The composition of this invention comprises a compound of formula I as defined herein or a salt thereof in admixture with an ophthalmologically acceptable excipient. An excipient is ophthalmologically acceptable if it is non irritating to the eye and non toxic at effective levels. The ophthalmic composition may be aqueous or non aqueous, and it may be in the form of a solution, suspension, gel, ointment, slow release polymer, or other. The amount of active ingredient will vary with the particular formulation and disease state but generally will be between 0.001 10 wt vol of active ingredient per individual application dose, preferably between 0.005 7 wt vol. Pharmaceutical ophthalmic compositions are typically provided as sterilized aqueous solutions i.e. eyedrops containing 0.001 to 10 wt vol. most preferably 0.005 to 1 of the active ingredient, along with a suitable buffer, stabilizer, and preservative. The total concentration of solutes should be such that, if possible, the resulting solution is isotonic with the lacrimal fluid though this is not absolutely necessary and has an equivalent pH in the range of pH 6 8 .Typical preservatives sterilants are phenylmercuric acetate, thimerosal, chlorobutanol, and benzalkonium chloride. Typical buffer systems and salts are based on, for example, citrate, borate or phosphate suitable stabilizers include glycerin and polysorbate 80. The aqueous solutions are formulated simply by dissolving the components in a suitable quantity of water, adjusting the pH to about 6.8 8.0, making a final volume adjustment with additional water, and sterilizing the preparation using methods known to those skilled in the art. The dosage level of the resulting composition will, of course, depend on the concentration of the drops, the condition of the subject and the individual magnitude of responses to treatment. However, typical dosage ranges might be about 2 10 drops of 0.1 solution of active ingredient once to three times per day. Most ophthalmic solutions and suspensions contain an aqueous rather than an oily vehicle. Ophthalmic ointments usually contain a white petrolatum mineral oil base, often including anhydrous lanolin, while some have a polyethylene gelled mineral oil base. Solutions are the most commonly used type of preparation for the local medication of eyes. They are easily instilled and rarely cause adverse reactions. The vehicle should not interfere with vision and should not interfere with regeneration of the corneal epithelium. Suspensions have the advantage of more extended action and the disadvantage that it is difficult to avoid the presence of a few particles which are large enough to cause irritation. Eye ointments are sterile preparations for application to the conjunctival sac or lid margin. They have advantages of more prolonged contact and effect, minimal irritation on initial installation, slower movement into lacrimal ducts, greater storage stability, and less likelihood of contamination problems. Their disadvantages are that they produce a film over the eye thereby blurring vision, and may interfere with the firm attachment of new corneal epithelial cells to their normal base. Ointments affect the outside and edges of the eyelids, the conjunctiva, the cornea, and the iris, depending on their ability to penetrate the outer covering of the eyeball. Ophthalmic ointments comprising active ingredients can be used on the outside and edges of the eyelids, the conjunctiva, and the cornea. Most ophthalmic ointments are prepared with a base of white or yellow petrolatum and mineral oil, often with added anhydrous lanolin.Whichever base is selected, it must be nonirritating to the eye, permit diffusion of the drug throughout the secretions bathing the eye, and retain the activity of the medicament for a reasonable period of time under proper storage conditions. Compounds of this invention may also be administered by other nonsystemic modes. Ophthalmic packs may be used to give prolonged contact of the solution with the eye.For example, a cotton pledget saturated with an ophthalmologically suitable solution of a compound of this invention may be inserted into the superior or inferior fornix. Medicated controlled release ophthalmic disks may produce effects both more intense and prolonged than solutions. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,190,642, incorporated herein by reference, which discloses a controlled release device for administering compounds to the eye, which may be useful in the practice of this invention. The compounds of the invention may also be administered by the way of iontophoresis. This procedure keeps the solution in contact with the cornea in an eyecup bearing an electrode. Diffusion of the drug is effected by difference of electrical potential.Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences, 15th Ed., 1489 1504, 1975 . PREPARATION OF THE INVENTION Compounds of formula I are prepared by the reaction sequence shown below. REACTION SEQUENCE IEMI12.1 EMI13.1 EMI14.1 wherein R1, R2, R3, and R4 are as defined above in the broadest aspect of the invention, Ts is tosyl p toluenesulfonyl , A is benzyloxy BzO or hydrogen,BzCl is benzyl chloride, and R is lower alkyl. When compounds in which R3 is hydrogen are desired, steps 1 and 7 are not necessary and are omitted in such cases step 6a, b, c, or d is the final step. For compounds in which R3 is hydroxy, 4 hydroxy3 nitrophenylacetic acid II , available, i.a., fromAldrich Chemical Co., is first converted to the methyl ester, then reacted with an equimolar amount of benzyl chloride, also available, i.a., from Aldrich ChemicalCo., using the Williamson Ether Synthesis to yield a hydroxy protected methyl 4 benzyloxy 3 nitrophenylacetate III, A BzO . The reaction is usually performed using potassium carbonate in refluxing acetonitrile or ethanol. Step 1. The protected nitrophenylacetic acid ester III, A BzO is then reduced, using borane methyl sulfide in a tetrahydrofuran THF solution at room temperature. After acidification with HC1 in methanol, the solution is evaporated, and the product 4 benzyloxy 3 nitrophenylethanol IV, A BzO extracted from aqueous sodium carbonate with diethyl ether Et20 . Similarly, compounds in which A H may be prepared by the same method, substituting 3 nitrophenylacetic acid III, A H for methyl 4 benzyloxy 3 nitrophenylacetate. 3 Nitrophenylacetic acid is available commercially from i.a.Aldrich Chemical Co. Step 2. The 4 benzyloxy 3 nitrophenylethanol IV, A BzO is then reacted with a molar excess of p tolunesulfonyl chloride in pyridine at OOC to produce a 4 benzyloxy3 nitrophenylethyl tosylate V, A BzO . The tosylate V,A BzO is extracted using ethyl acetate. Similarly, compounds in which A H may be prepared by the same method, substituting 3 nitrophenylethanol IV, A H for 4 benzyloxy 3 nitrophenylethanol. Step 3. The tosylate V, A BzO is reacted with an equimolar amount of the desired dialkyl amine or cycloalkyl amine in dimethylformamide DMF at 650C to produce a 2 benzyloxy 5 dialkyl or cycloalkyl aminoethylnitrobenzene VI, A BzO . Similarly, compounds in which A H may be prepared by the same method, substituting 3 nitrophenylethyl tosylate V, A H for 4 benzyloxy 3nitrophenylethyl tosylate.Dialkyl and cycloalkyl amines may be obtained from commercial sources, e.g., AldrichChemical Co., or may be made by methods known in the art. Step 4. The 2 benzyloxy 5 dialkyl or cycloalkyl aminoethylnitrobenzene VI, A BzO is then reduced to a 2 benzyloxy 5 dialkyl or cycloalkyl aminoethylaniline derivative VII, A BzO with hydrazine and Raney nickel in refluxing ethanol at ambient pressure with an equimolar amount of hydrogen, using the general method known for other unrelated compounds. See, e.g., Introduction to Organic Chemistry, by Andrew Streitwieser, Jr., and Clayton H. Heathcock, Ch. 32, p.961 1976 . Similarly, compounds in which A H may be prepared by the same method, substituting 3 dialkyl or cycloalkyl aminoethylnitrobenzene VI, A H for 2 benzyloxy 5 dialkyl or cycloalkyl aminoethyinitrobenzene. Step 5. The sequence is completed by reacting the aniline derivative with an equimolar amount of the appropriate reactive formyl derivative, carboxylic acid derivative, isocyanate, or alkylisocyanate. If a formamido derivative VIIIa, A H or BzO is desired, the novel aniline derivative VII, A H or BzO is reacted at OOC with an equimolar amount of an appropriate reactive formyl derivative e.g., formic acetic anhydride, which may be generated in situ from sodium formate and acetyl chloride, which are commercially available in an appropriate aprotic base. Step 6a. To produce a compound in which R4 is lower alkyl VIIIb, A H or BzO , the aniline derivative VII, A H orBzO is reacted at 250C with an equimolar amount of an appropriate reactive carboxylic acid derivative, especially an acyl halide, in an appropriate aprotic base. Carboxylic acid chlorides are available commercially, or may be prepared from commercially available carboxylic acids by methods known in the art. Step 6b. To produce a ureidobenzene derivative VIIIc, A H orBzO , the aniline derivative VII, A H or BzO is reacted at 250C with an equimolar amount of an appropriate cyanate salt, e.g., potassium cyanate, in an acidic medium. Step 6c. To produce an alkyl ureidobenzene derivative VIlId, A H or BzO , the aniline derivative VII, A H or BzO is reacted at 250C with an equimolar amount of an appropriate alkyl isocyanate, usinp the general method known in the art for unrelated compounds. See, e.g.,Introduction to Organic Chemistry, Streitwieser BR Heathcock, Ch. 27, p. 801. Alkyl isocyanates may be obtained commercially, or may be produced by reacting the appropriate alkyl halide with a reactive cyanate salt. Step 6d. In compounds wherein R3 is hydrogen, Step 6a, b, c, or d produces the compound of formula I directly.Where R3 is hydroxy, it is necessary to remove the benzyloxy protecting group. This may be accomplished by the method described in Catalytic Hydrogenatron inOrganic Synthesis Procedures and Commentarv, M.Freifelder, Wiley, 1978 , p.109, e.g., by catalytic hydrogenolysis of the penultimate compound VIIIa d using palladium on carbon in methanol at ambient temperature and a pressure of 2 atmospheres, affording the compound of the invention I . In summary, compounds of formula I are prepared by the following methods Compounds of formula I in which R3 is H are prepared by reacting a compound of formula VII whereA H with an appropriate reactive formyl derivative, carboxylic acid derivative, isocyanate salt, or alkylisocyanate, to produce the corresponding formanilide derivative, alkanylanilide derivative, ureidobenzene derivative, or alkylurea derivative. These reactions may be performed at atmospheric pressure, and at temperatures between the freezing and boiling points nf the solvents employed, preferably between about 50C and about 110 C, and most preferably at about 250C. Compounds of formula I in which R3 is OH are prepared by performing the same Procedure using a compound of formula VII where A BzO, followed by removal of the protecting benzyloxy group, e.g., by catalytic hydrogenolysis with H2 over palladium on carbon at about 6O0C and pressure of about two atmospheres. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of formula I are prepared by reacting a free base of formula I with an appropriate acid. Free bases of formula I are prepared by reacting an acid addition salt of a compound of formula I with an appropriate base. The following specific description is given to enable those skilled in the art to more clearly understand and practice the invention.

EXAMPLE 9 Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat Assay 24 previously trained adult male spontaneously hypertensive rats were distributed into 6 groups 4 animals per group with approximately equal mean systolic blood pressures. The 6 groups were then studied concurrently in a 2 day compound screening procedure. Test compounds were randomly assigned to each group. 5 groups received potential antihypertensive agents and 1 control group received vehicle only water and Tween . At approximately 17 hours prior to the first day of dosing food was removed from the rat cages. On the morning of Day 1, a group of 4 rats was orally dosed by gavage with 12.5 mg kg or 25 mg kg of 3 2 N,N di npropylaminoethyl ureidobenzene I or other tested compound dissolved suspended in water using 2 3 dropsTween 80 with a homogenizer at concentrations such that 0.1 ml of solution was administered per 10 g of body weight. At 4 1 2 hours post dose, food was put back in the cages and the rats were allowed to eat for 2 1 2 hours, after which food was again removed. On the morning of Day 2, rats were orally dosed as described above. Immediately after dosing, the rats were put in restrainers and placed in a heated chamber 30 1.0 C for four hours. Normal feeding resumed at the end of the study on Day 2. Systolic blood pressure i.e., pressure at the appearance of the first pulse were recorded using photoelectric transducers. The coccygeal arteries of 3 rats in a horizontal group were simultaneously occluded by pump inflated tail cuffs that were automatically inflated to 300 mmHg and then deflated. A pressure curve and tail pulses were simultaneously monitored on an MFE recorder. Four consecutive at 30 second intervals traces were recorded for each rat in a given horizontal group at one, two, three and four hours post compound administration. Subsequent horizontal groups were automatically tested in the same manner. The mean systolic blood pressure SBP of each rat at each observation time was calculated. The SBP of the animals in each dose group were compared to the SBP of the animals in the control group vehicle only at each observation time using a one way analysis of variance test. A compound exhibiting p 0.05 at any observation time was considered to exhibit significant antihypertensive activity. Compounds significantly decreasing blood pressure 20 mmHg or more from control values at all four observation times were considered worthy of further examination. In these instances heart rates were calculated and tested for significant change from control heart rate values using the two tailed test. Pressures were read at hours 1, 2, 3 and 4 after dosing on both days 1 and 2.The compounds of the invention exhibited positive antihypertensive activity in this test as shown in the following table.

EXAMPLE 10 Ocular Irritation Test Each studied compound is tested individually on a single animal by administering, at the same time, into one eye of the animal the ophthalmic solution with the test corpound as an active ingredient and to the other eye only vehicle ophthalmic solution. An irritation, if any, caused by tested compounds is compared to the non irritating effect of the vehicle ophthalmic solution applied to the other eye. Irritation is measured by the number of blinks of each eye during the same time period. Tests are performed on rabbits. Ophthalmic solutions with compounds of the invention as the active ingredient are prepared at concentrations of 0.01 to 0.5 . One drop of the test ophthalmic solution with active ingredient is administered directly into the conjuctival sack of the rabbit s left eye. At the same time one drop of vehicle is administered to the conjunctival sack of the rabbit s right eye. Irritation of each eye is measured by counting the number of blinks for one minute after the application.The results are expressed as the mean number of blinks standard error per eye. The mean number of blinks minute is averaged for the vehicle treatment and compared to the active compound treated eye. Compounds may be similarly tested in mongrel dogs and rhesus monkeys. The compounds of this invention do not elicit any irritation of the eyes, and their effects are comparable to the effect of the vehicle ophthalmic solution without any active compound added. EXAMPLE 11 Reduction Of Intraocular Pressure This example illustrates the effect of compounds of the current invention on intraocular pressure IOP . Two groups of normal albino white New Zealand rabbits are used for this study. Control group 4 animals Experimental group 8 animalsExperimental schedule At time 0, the intraocular pressure of both eyes of each animal in control and experimental groups is determined. All animals receive the treatment either with saline control group or the tested compound experimental group immediately after the 0 hour intraocular pressure reading. The control group receives 50 g of vehicle in each eye, while experimental animals receive SOul of vehicle in the left eyes and 50 1 of 1 solution of the tested compound in the right eyes. Intraocular pressure is measured at 30 minutes, 1, 2, and 4 hours after administration.Experimental Procedure The effects of tested compounds on intraocular pressure IOP of rabbits are determined using a DigilabModel 30D pneuma tonometer. Initial lOP readings are obtained in all animals after the administration of 50 p1 of 0.5 Opthaine proparacaine hydrochloride . A group of 4 rabbits serves as control and is treated with 50 p1 of saline in both eyes. Eight additional rabbits receive 50 p1 of test compound in the right eye, and 50 p1 of drug vehicle in the contralateral left eye.IOP readings are made 30 minutes, 1 hours, 2 hours, and 4 hours after administration. Rabbits are observed for any signs of ocular irritation. This procedure permits the comparison of the active compound treated eyes with the contralateral vehicle treated eyes, and also with saline treated eyes. For purposes of statistical analysis comparisons are made between the IOP values for active compound treated eyes, vehicle treated contralateral eyes and the saline treated eyes. The compounds of formula I are active in this assay as shown in the following table.EMI46.1 TABLE lowering Compound of Blood Pressure R1 R2 R3 R4 Salt 30 min. 1 hr 2 hrs 4 hrs Control 19 19.1 18.9 20.5 Saline vehicle 18.9 19.5 20 20.6N Propyl N Propyl H CH3 HBr 16.4 16.4 18.4 21N Propyl N Propyl H N2 HBr 17 16.1 18.8 20.4N Propyl N butyl H NH2 HC1 15 12.6 12.2 15.2
