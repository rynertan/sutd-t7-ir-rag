# Tone signal generation device for an electronic musical instrument.

## Abstract
A musical tone signal generator for an electronic musical instrument is constructed by a waveshape generator 13, 14 , a function generator 16 and an interpolator 18, 19, 20 . The waveshape generator 13, 14 successively generates adjacent two waveshapes of a plurality of different waveshapes which have been intermittently sampled in an actual produced tone. The function generator 16 generates an interpolation function which is a function of time. The interpolator 18, 19, 20 weights the adjacent two waveshapes in accordance with the interpolation function, combines the weighted two waveshapes and outputs the combined waveshape as a musical tone waveshape to be produced at a rate corresponding to a frequency of the musical tone waveshape. In the waveshape generator 13, 14 , the generation of next two adjacent waveshapes are performed when a value of the interpolation function has become equal to a predetermined value. As a result, it is made possible to obtain a good quality timewise spectrum change of the musical tone waveshape.
