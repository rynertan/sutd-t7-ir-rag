## Description
Eyedroppcr bottle holder The invention relates to an eyedropper bottle stabilizer for administering eyedrops from an ordinary squeeze ttpe dropper bottle. An object of the invention is the provision of a bottle holder that can be used interchangeably with bottles of the same or different sizes, and which preferably can be adjusted to suit an individual patient, alloying safe and accurate administration of drops to the eye of the patient. In the administration of eyedrops, it is important to hold the dispensing tip steady and far enough from the eye to allow the medication to drop directly onto the eyeball and to keep the tip of the dropper bottle from touching the eye. It is important and desirable to drop the medication near the centre of the eye, and to be able to do this using only one hand. In sel aduiinistration of eyedrops, it is necessary to brace that hand against a steady object and at the same time position the dropper bottle tip directly over the centre of the eye. It is desirable, if possible, to position the tip of the dropper bottle directly over the centre of the eye so that the eye receiving the medication can see the drop as it forms and falls. The ordinary eyedroppers or squceze type dropping bottles are convenient. simple to operate, and inexpensive to manufacture.However such devices suffer from the drawback of messiness and unsteadiness of the person who is administering the medication to hint elf A number of devices have been prepared to allow steady, safe, and accurate dispensing Most of these devices suffer from disadvantages such as bulkiness, complicated operation, or high cost of manufacture. In addition, most of the prior art devices suffer from the aspect of being throw away devices.1, That is, the structure which is intended as a means of assisting the patient is an integral part of the administering container and thus when the medication is exhausted, the relatively expensive device must be discarded along with the container. According to one aspect of the Invention there is provided all adjustable eyedropper bottle holder for use in conJunction With a squeeze type eyedropper bottle for dispensing of eyedrops, comprising a nose bridge rest, a spacer bar, a slide channel integral with the nose bridge rest and the spacer bar and a slide bar to slide in close fitting relationship in the slide channel and having at one of its ends means to receive and hold an eyedropper bottle. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided an eyedropper bottle holder for use in conjunction with a squeeze type eyedropper bottle for dispensing of eyedrops, comprising an integral structure including a generally cylindrically shaped eyedropper bottle receptacle and a nose bridge rest having a concave shape to engage the bridge of a patient s nose, the nosebridge rest being displaced from the eyedropper bottle receptacle by an L shaped spacer bar integral at one of its ends with the cylindrically shaped bottle receptacle and at the opposite one of its ends with the nose bridge rest, the lengths of the arms of the Lshaped spacer bar being such that, in the position of use, the eyedropper bottle receptacle is displaced horizontally from the nosebridge rest approximately the distance between the bridge of the nose and the pupil of the eye of a patient and the nose bridge rest is displaced vertically a distance such that the nose bridge rest is slightly farther removed vertically from the base of the eyedropper bottle receptacle than the dropping tip of a squeezetype dropper bottle inserted in the receptacle. One of the prime advantages is that the present device can be used with a standard size and type dropper bottle, and can be used merely by inserting the inexpensive dropper bottle into the holder and using it in the manner subsequently described herein. A furtbcr advantage of one of the preferred enbodiments of the invention is that it may be used with various sizes and types of eyedropper bottle, and can be used by merely inserting the inexpen sive dropper bottle into the holder, adjusting the slide bar in the slide charnel, and using it in the manner subsequently described herein. In addition to being an inexpensive and simple device, the present holder can be lighter than the devices of the prior art and therefore much easier to control by a patient administering medication to himself. The it mention is diagrammatically illustrated by way of example in the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a first embodiment of an eyedropper bottle holder according to the invention Figure 2 is a top view of the eyedrcpper bcttle holder ofFigure 1 figure 3 is a view illustrating use of the eyedropperbottle holder of Figures 1 and 2 by a patient Figure 4 is a perspective view showing use of a second embodiment of an eyedropper bottle holder according to the invention by a patient Figure 5 is a vertical sectional view of said second em bodiment of an eyedropper bottle holder with an eydropper bottle positioned ready for use Figure 6 is a horizontal sectional view of the eyedropperbottle holder of Figure 5 taken on a plane formed by the underside of a slide bar including a bottle holder Figure 7 is a perspective view of the two component parts of said second embodiment of an adjustable eyedropper bottle holder before assembly and Figure 8 is a vertical sectional view of a third embodiment of an eyedropper bottle holder according to the invention showing an adjustable holder to hold a specific size bottle. Referring to Figure t an eyedropper bottle holder is formed of vinyl or low density polyethylene and preferably of a transparent, resilient low density polyethylene. The holder is formed of a single piece of plastics material and comprising a generally cylindrically shaped receptacle 18 having a circumferential wall 20 with a bottom flange 22 extending inwardly from the wall 20. A squeezetype dropper bottle 2 baving a dropper tip 26 is also shown.A horizontal flat spacer bar 16 extends from the receptacle 18 to a vertical flat spacer bar 14s the bar 16 and the bar 1k together forming an L shaped spacer bar terminating in a nose bridge rest 10 integral therewith and having raised ends and a depressed centre 12 to provide a relatively stable rest to engage the bridge of a patient s nose. The vertical spacer bar 14 is of such a length that the nose e n s bridge rest 10 is vertically ly further removed from the base of the bottle receptacle 22 than is the tip 26 of the inserted dropper bottle 24. As illustrated in Figure 3, in use the eyedropper bottle 24 is inserted into the generally cylindrical receptacle 18, the entire holder is inverted and the depressed centre 12 of the nose bridge rest 10 is placed against the bridge of the nose of the patient, the patient having his heid tilted, The horizontal displacement from the centre 12 of the nose bridge rest 10 to the centre of the bottle receptacle 18 is approximately the distance from the bridge of the nose to the pupil of the eye of thc patient being treated. Referring to Figure 4, the second and preferred embodiment of an eyedropper bottle holder is shown in actual use by a patient. The head of the patient is tilted back and the holder and a dropper bottle held therein is inverted and positioned so that the dropperbottle tip is positioned directly over the pupil of the eye being treated. The bottle holder of Fi nres 4 to 7 is adjustable before use by sliding a flat spacer slide bar 34 through a close fitting, rectangularly shaped slide channel 33 in a slide 32 until the horizontal displacement between the depressed centre 29 of a nosebridge rest 30 and the tip 26 of a dropper bottle tip 21s matches the horizontal distance between the patient s nose bridge and the pupil of the eye being treated. The entire holder is fabricated of a resilient translucent or opaque plastics material such as vinyl or low density polyethylene, polypropylene or nylon. The flat slide bar 34 is of rectangular cross sectional and has at one end a circular shaped extension 35 integral with the flat slide bar 34, the extension 35 having an opening therein to receive the neck of an eyedropper bottle 24. The opening is surrounded by an integral collar 36 having slits 37 cut through the collar at regular intervals. The collar 36 is designed to provide a snug fit for the neck of dropper bottles of various sizes, thus providing a versatile bottle holder. The slide 32 is integral with a vertical, flat spaccr bar 31 terminating in the nose bridge rest 30, which is of concave construction so that it can rest in a stable position on the nose of a patient. So that the slide bar 34 can be held in any one of several positions, the surface of the slide bar 34 which is uppermost in the position of use has at least one stop 38 to prevent the slide 32 from slipping off the end of the slide bar 34 or coming into contact with the dropper bottle 24. Said surface is further provided with spaced, transverse ridges or depressions 39 to engage at any one of various stop positions with a raised transverse ridge 40 on the co operating opposing internal surface of the slide channel 33. The vertical spacer bar 31 carrying the nose bridge rest 30 is designed so that the depressed centre 29 of the nose bridge rest 30 is slightly less further displaced vertically from the top surface of the slide bar 34 than is the tip 26 of the dropper bottle 24. In the embodiment of Figure 8, one end of the bottle carrying slide bar 34 is integrally attached to a generally cylindrically shaped receptacle 42 having a flange 41 extending inwardly from the wall of the open ended receptacle 42. In this embodiment, the length of the vertical spacer bar 31 bearing the nose bridge piece 30 is so chosen that the depressed centre 29 of the nose bridge piece 30 is slightly further displaced from the bottle carrying slide bar 7 than is the tip 25 of the dropper bottle. In each of the second and third embodiments, each of the two components, viz the slide 32 and the slide bar 34, 35, are moulded from a single piece of plastics material preferably nylon or alternatively low density polyethylene or polypropylene.
