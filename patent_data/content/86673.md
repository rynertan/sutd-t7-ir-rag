# RADIOGRAPH IDENTIFYING MEANS

## Abstract
A flexible character indentable plastics embossing tape 11 is backed by and bonded to a lead strip not more than 0.025 inches i.e. approximately 0.65 millimetres thick, to form a tape suitable for identifying radiographs. The lead strip 13 is itself backed by a relatively thin and flimsy plastics or fabric strip 5 which, when removed, alloys the lead and hence the lead plastic tape as a whole to be pressure bonded to the surface to be radiographed. A conventional tape embossing gun is used to indent the desired characters in succession, and in order, into the lead backed tape, without necessarily severing the lead and then the backing strip 15 is peeled away to expose the layer 14 of adhesive which pressure bonds the indented tape to the ob ject to be radiographed. X rays incident on the embossed tape will cause the raised characters a to show up dark on the subsequently developed film, whilst the raised side areas b will show up white. Each character will thus stand out on the developed film.
