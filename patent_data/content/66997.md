# Biaxially oriented polyester films.

## Abstract
A biaxially oriented polyester film composed of a poly ester composition comprising A 100 parts by weight of a substantially linear polyalkyl ene terephthalate having ethylene terephthalate as a main structural component B 0.01 to 5 parts by weight of an ester of an aliphatic polyol having at least 4 hydroxyl groups in the molecule with an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid having at least 8 carbon atoms and C not more than 0.8 parts by weight of fine inorganic particles having an average particle diameter of not more than 1 micron and being substantially insoluble in the polyalkylene terephthalate is useful as a base of magnetic tapes.
