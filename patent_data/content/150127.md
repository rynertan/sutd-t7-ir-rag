# SUCTION GENERATING DEVICE, PARTICULARY FOR FLUID SAMPLING

## Abstract
A suction generating device comprises a barrel 10 within which may slide a plunger 26. A chamber 30 within the plunger is so sealed at each end that it increases in volume as the plunger is manually displaced inwardly of the barrel. An inlet 16 of the device is connected to the chamber 30 by a stem 18 so that inward movement of the plunger generates suction at the inlet 16. The device is particularly suited for single handed utilisation as a blood sampling syringe or as a fluid transfer device.
