# Active clearance control.

## Abstract
Active clearance control is effectuated by heating the bore 22 of the high pressure compressor spool 14 so as to expand the compressor disk 54 and labyrinth seals 56 to minimize the gap between the blades 50 and its peripheral seal 52 and labyrinth seal 56 . The high stages of the high spool compressor 14 are selectively bled to achieve the desired gap control over the engine s operating envelope. The bled air is fed into the bore 22 by conducting the air exter nally of the engine s case 20 and admitting it through hollow stator vanes 12 of the low pressure spool 10 and antivortex tubes communicating with a cavity at the bearing supporting the high pressure compressor shaft at a juncture in line with the inlet of the high pressure compressor spool 14 .
