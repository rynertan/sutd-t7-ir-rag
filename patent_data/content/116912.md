# Method of controlling motor speed.

## Abstract
The speed of a motor supported on a supporting base the position of which is changed during operation of the motor is controlled by use of a detector for detecting the degree of angular acceleration of the motor supporting base in a plane normal to the shaft of the motor. The angular acceleration detector is supported on the motor supporting base, and the signal detected thereby is used as one of the speed control command signals.
