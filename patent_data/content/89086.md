# PROCESS FOR FORMING EMULSION EMULSION POLYMERS

## Abstract
Polymer coagulum formation during emulsion emulsion polymerization procedures for forming polymeric material containing rubbery and relatively more rigid polymer com ponents is reduced by conducting the polymerizarion of the rubbery component in two stages. The initial stage involves polymerization of only a portion of the monomer charge in a reaction medium containing adequate surfactant so that the resulting polymer particles do not coalesce. The second stage of the polymerization involves addition of the remain ing monomer without the aadition of additional surfactant to complete polymerization of the rubbery polymer product.
