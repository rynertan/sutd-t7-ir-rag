# Distributed variable band switching system for speech and data.

## Abstract
The system comprises a plurality of nodes N1...Nm , arranged along a folded unidirectional bus 1 and associated each with a plurality of terminals TE1....TEmp . Each node comprises two directional couplers, one AT for transmis sion and the other AR for reception, which are common to all the terminals of the node a detector RRS of the activity generated in the upstream nodes, a detector CS of the activity generated either in the upstream nodes or in the node itself, and a detector CD of collision among terminals belonging to the same node. The detectors RRS, CS, CD are connected to devices AB , provided for in each terminal of the node, which implement an ordered arrangement of the terminals for the data transmission and make it possible to establish synchronous communications channels for speech transmission.
