## Description
The present invention relates to a composition for use in the treatment of haemorrhoids. The ubiquitous problem of haemorrhoids has not heretofore been treated with consistent success, either by surgery or by the use of such remedies as anal creams, jellies and suppositories. Such treatments are clearly symptomatic in character and afford only temporary relief in a majority of cases. The recurrence of the problem is the rule rather than the exception. The desirability of an effective treatment for the cure of haemorrhoids is readily apparent effective and permanent remission is preferable to temporary symptomatic relief. It has been found that certain nerves that are related to the digestive tract in general, and to the colon and rectum in particular, are concentrated in the residuum of the umbilical cord. It has further been found that these nerves can be locally anaesthetized, with the result of rapid remission and apparent cure of haemorrhoids. The umbilical nerves can be suitable anaesthetized by the topical application to the navel of 2 camphanone, which acts as a local anaesthetic, in a suitable carrier. The local anaesthetic should be used in non toxic and non irritating dosage levels, and should be dissolved or disbursed in a suitable medium that will effectively wet the skin so that the anaesthetic can be absorbed therein with maximum effectiveness. The present invention provides a topical pharmaceutical composition for the percutaneous treatment of haemorrhoids in humans, said composition consisting of 5.5 by weight of 2 camphanone as sole active anti haemorrhoidal ingredient and 94.5 by weight of carrier. 2 camphanone is readily absorbed through the skin and serves to effectively anaesthetize the nerve ganglia, is of relatively low toxicity when incorporated in suitable carrier media, and can be readily formulated with a variety of carrier media with few problems of incompatibility, stability, or the production of side effects. The carrier medium can be substantially any conventional carrier that is physically and chemically compatible with 2 camphanone and can be in the form of liquid, cream, ointments, jellies, or sprays. Such topical carrier media are exceptionally well known and need not be discussed in detail. The composition can be applied at any convenient and conventional fashion to the navel, including the use of liquid dropper apparatus, aerosol sprays, solid stick compositions, or simply topical creams that are applied and rubbed into the navel. In more formulations, it is helpful to include a component that causes the composition to readily wet the skin of the patient, although the inclusion of wetting agents in such carrier formulations is usual and wholly conventional. The dosage of application of the formulation is not a narrowly critical variable in the present invention. It has been found that when 2 camphanone is incorporated in the formulation at a level of 5.5 percent by weight, no irritation of the skin or other undesirable side effects will result, regardless of the dosage applied to the navel region. At such concentrations, the minimum dosage for effective results is about the minimum that can conveniently be applied, e.g., in the case of a liquid, one drop is ordinarily sufficient. The operation of the present invention is enhanced, however, by the application of a number of dosages at about 24 hour intervals for a period of about 7 to 10 days. Still better results have been found to occur when the composition is applied topically once daily for about 2 or 3 days, and the routine is then interrupted for a period of 2 or 3 days, and then initiated again for about 7 to 10 days. At the conclusion of the administration as outlined, in most patients, haemorrhoids will have been eliminated, together with itching, pain, bleeding, and other symptoms associated with the condition. Even in patients where the problem is not entirely eliminated at the conclusions of treatment, the symptoms are quite substantially reduced, and will continue to regress without the utilization of further treatment. The operation of the present invention is not clearly understood at present, but it is believed that the local anaesthetic agent operates upon the nerves associated with the umbilical cord residuum in the navel, and that these nerves, by virtue of their involvement in the digestive tract, are associated with the causes of haemorrhoids and related conditions. The mechanism by which the anaesthetic operates upon the nerves and the effect of such anaesthetization upon the digestive tract is at present unknown. Accordingly, applicants do not wish to be bound by any theory of the mode of operation of the composition or the method of the present invention. The composition of the present invention can be understood with reference to the following specific embodiment of Example 1, which is a preferred mode of formulating the composition of the present invention. A solution is formulated comprising 88.5 by weight ethanol U.S.P. 190 Proof 5.5 by weight camphor U.S.P. 1.0 by weight coconut oil, 5.0 by weight Surfa M 801, a proprietary masking and perfuming agent manufactured by Stepan Chemical Company, Maywood, Division, Maywood, New Jersey. In the composition, the coconut oil serves as a wetting agent and causes the composition to readily wet the skin. Camphor is a well known local anaesthetic having a relatively low level of toxicity, while the ethyl alcohol serves as an effective carrier medium, and is believed to contribute to a minor degree to the anaesthetic action of the composition, and in addition, is believed to aid in the penetration of the skin by the camphor. The administration of the composition of the present invention is exemplified by the following example utilizing the composition of Example 1. Again, it should be noted, that the Examples are not intended to define the scope of the invention, but merely to illustrate the composition and method of the present invention. Four patients suffering from haemorrhoids were supplied with the composition of Example 1 in a dropper bottle. Each patient was administered two drops to the navel at bedtime on the first, second and third days, the treatment was suspended on the fourth to sixth days, and then on days seven to thirteen, two drops were applied to the navel each day at bedtime. At the conclusion of the 13th day, treatment was suspended and each patient was examined. Each was found to have normal rectal conditions and reported the elimination of subjective symptoms including pain and itching. One of the patients had suffered from chronic diarrhoea for a substantial period of time. The composition of the present invention proved to eliminate the condition in this case and the patient achieved regularity of bowel movements in addition to the elimination of haemorrhoids.
