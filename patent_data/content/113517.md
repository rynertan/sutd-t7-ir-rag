# Method for forming an isolation region.

## Abstract
A method for forming isolation grooves of submicron width in a semiconductor substrate 1 comprising the steps of forming a metal or a metal silicide layer 2 above the semiconductor substrate 1 then forming a resist layer 3 on the metal or metal silicide layer patterning the resist layer selectively etching the metal or metal silicide layer and the semiconductor substrate by the reactive ion etching process using a mixture of chlorine containing gas and oxygen gas to form a groove 4 in the surface portion of the semiconductor substrate located around the edge of the resist layer and forming an insulating layer in the groove.
