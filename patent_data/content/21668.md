# A machine for folding flexible sheet material.

## Abstract
A machine for folding bags wherein bags are rolled and removed from rolling cages 28, 30 through an opening 32 between the rolling cages. The rolling cages have an internal moving surface extending through an arc of 270 formed by a series of drive rollers 26 mounted on shafts 20 . In order to minimize ballooning of the bag during rolling the moving surface within the rolling cages 28, 30 is extended beyond the rolling cages and into the opening between the rolling cages.
