# Curved glove construction.

## Abstract
Clute cut glove construction is disclosed comprising in part a bottom hand or palm piece including bottom finger pieces F₁,F₂,F₃,F₄ , and a separate back piece 40, 60, 80, 100 for each of the bottom finger pieces. Each back piece 40, 60, 80, 100 further comprises a finger portion B₁,B₂,B₃,B₄ and a hand portion B ₁, B ₂, B ₃,B ₄ . Illustratively, each finger portion B₁,B₂,B₃,B₄ of each back piece 40, 60, 80, 100 is cut to have a longer longitudinal length than the associated bottom finger piece F₁,F₂,F₃,F₄ . Similarly, each finger portion B₁,B₂,B₃,B₄ of each back piece 40, 60, 80, 100 is cut to have a wider width than the associated bottom finger piece F₁,F₂,F₃,F₄ . Furthermore, the width of each back piece 40, 60, 80, 100 is uniquely cut to vary along the length of the finger and hand portions. During stitching of the back and bottom pieces, each portion of the bottom piece is stretched in order to align the edges of each bottom piece with the edges of its associated back piece After the stitching operation, when the glove is no longer stretched, the fingers of the glove have the shape of fingers of a hand and curve inward toward the palm so that in use the glove can be moved to a clasping position without crumpling, creasing, or folding of the finger and palm sections of the glove.
