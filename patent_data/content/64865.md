## Description
DESCRIPTION Instrument Panel This invention relates to instrument panels,especially motor vehicle instrument panels. Conventional motor vehicle instrument panels comprise a display unit having a plurality of adjacent areas which are separately illuminable, for example a speedometer dial, gauges and warning lights. In order to reduce reflections from such instrument panels via the vehicle windscreen at night, it has been proposed to secure a shade comprising a set of horizontal, parallel louvres over the display unit as disclosed in British Patent Specification No. 1285387 . Where the display unit indludes electronic light sources such as vacuum flourescent tubes, light emitting diodes or liquid crystal displays, the intensity of the light source is relatively low and its visibility is significantly reduced in daylight. Hitherto this problem has been solved by positioning the display unit deep within a recess in an instrument panel housing. This is however unsatisfactory in that the display unit is positioned further from the driver s eye, and the necessity ofsproviding a deep recess for the unit places a restriction on the styling of the instrument panel housing. According to the present invention there is provided an instrument panel comprising a display unit having a plurality of illuminable adjacent display areas, and a shade having a plurality of louvres overlying the display unit, characterised in that the shade comprises a grid of intersecting louvres positioned immediately adjacent the display unit and defining apertures of a shape and size corresponding to and registering with the display areas. By providing a grid of intersecting lourvres and matching the apertures therein to the shape and size of the display areas, the shade can be of a relatively shallow depth and still provide adequate shade for each display area. For example we have found that if the shade is positioned immediately adjacent the surface of the display unit, adequate shade can be provided by louvres of from 0.25 to 1.5 cm in depth and a horizontal and vertical spacing of from 1. to 2.5 cm. The configuration of the grid will depend upon the relative shapes and sizes of the display areas. In general however, the display unit can be sub divided into a plurality of rectangular or square display areas. Consequently the shade will usually comprise a grid of intersecting horizontal and vertical louvres. In order to reduce the effects of parallax, the horizontal louvres are preferably arranged in planes which converge towards a predetermined observation region such as the vehicle eyeellipse , ie the elliptical region in which the average vehicle driver s eye is normally positioned. Similarly the vertical louvres are preferably arranged in planes which also converge towards a predetermined observation region such as the eye ellipse. In order to reduce the amount of light reflected normally from the display unit, a layer of transparent material having a nonreflective surface preferably overlies the display unit. The shade is preferably positioned between this layer of transparent material and the surface of the display unit so that the layer prevents dust from settling on the louvres. Although the invention is applicable to instrument panels incorporating any display unit, it is most appropriate for electronic display units. Figure 1 illustrates a side view of a motor vehicle incorporating an instrument panel in accordance with the invention Figure 2 illustrates a plan of the motor vehicle ofFigure 1 Figure 3 illustrates, in perspective, the instrument panel incorporated in the vehicle of Figures 1 and 2, Figure 4 is an enlarged view of part of the panel ofFigure 3. Referring to Figures 1 and 2 of the drawings, a motor vehicle 1 comprises an instrument panel 2 mounted in a housing 3 beneath the windscreen 4 and above the steering column 5. The driver sits rearwardly of the column in a position such that his eye normally lies within the ellipsoidal volume 6 known as the eye ellipse. Referring now to Figures 3 and 4, the instrument panel 2 comprises a display unit 10 which, in the present exar iple,is a vacuum flourescent discharge tube of conventional construction.Electric current is supplied to the unit 10 via terminals 11 sealed into the glass envelope 12 of the unit 10. As best illustrated in Figure 4, the display unit 10 has a plurality of adjacent display areas 15, 16 each of which can be illuminated separately to display information. For example the display area 15 contains an alphanumeric display which, in conjunction with adjacent areas may indicate time, speed, engine speed or distance. Another area 16 contains an indicator light which for example shows the state of illumination of the vehicle headlamp.Immediately adjacent the display unit 10 in contact with the surface of the envelope 12 is a shade 20 which comprises a grid of horizontal and vertical louvres 21, 22 which are of dark, nonreflective material. The horizontal and vertical louvres intersect at 90 to provide an array of rectangular or square apertures 25. The shape and size of the apertures corresponds with the shape and size of the display areas 15, 16 and lie in registry therewith so that each of the display areas 15,16 is visible through a respective one of the apertures 25. louvres 22 are all arranged in planes directed towards the eye eclipse 6 so that the extent to which they obscure the visibility of the display areas 18,16 is minimised. In the present example these planes converge along the lines 26 illustrated inFigure 1. , fl arrangement in which the horizontal louvres 22 are paral el is also possible. Trilarly the vertical louvres 21 are all arranged in planes di ected towards the eye ellipse 6. Since the width of the panel es greater than its height, it is more important than the vert al louvres should be arranged in converging planes, as indic ed by the lines 27 in Figure 2. layer 30 of transparent material overlies the shade 20 so that tzte shade 20 is positioned between the layer 30 and the surface cf the display unit 10. The outer surface 31 of the layer 30 is treated to reduce reflections. This may for example be achieved y coating the outer surface 31 with a layer of conventional non reflective material or etching the outer surface in a known way. In practice the precise dimensions chosen for the size and shape of the apertures and the depth of the louvres will vary according so the size and shape of the display areas. For most purposes ever, rectangular or square display areas will be appropriate, in which case rectangular or square apertures kill be chosen. In most electronic instrument panels individual display areas for nach adphanumeric are not greater than 3 cm square and are ursrally about 1.5 cm square. The vertical and horizontal spacings 5 r the louvres V and h Fig.4 will therefore not normally h exceed 3 . Usually the spacingsi d and v will be from 1 to 2.5 cm and prefe ibly marginally large. than the size of the symbol displayed. For example where a O.5 cm square symbol is used, the spacings v and d are preferably 1.8 cm so that the effects of parralax are reduced. Similarly the depth d of the louvres will vary with the size and shape of the display area 20. Where small display areas are used, the depth d will be shallower. A further factor influencing the depth d is the distortion produced by the non reflective coating on the layer of transparent material 30. In most cases a depth d of 0.25 to 1.5 cm will be appropriate.Preferably the depth d is less than 1 cm and, in the example illustrated, a depth d of 0.8 cm is used It will be appreciated that, in use, the louvres 21,22 and the non reflective coating on the layer 30 reduce the amount of light falling on the display areas and therefore improve the visibility of these areas in daylight. In addition, the horizontal louvres prevent light from the display unit from being reflected off the windscreen 4 as indicated by the line 40 in Fig.1 thereby interferring with the driver s view from the vehicle at night. In an alternative embodiment of the invention not illustrated the shade 20 is incorporated within the envelope 12 of the display unit 10, reducing the depth of the panel.
