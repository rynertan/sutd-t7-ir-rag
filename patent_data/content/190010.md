## Description
The present invention is related to conditioning shampoos which have a dispersed, insoluble, non volatile silicone phase and are stabilized through the use of xanthan gum. Human hair becomes soiled due to its contact with the surrounding atmosphere and, to a greater extent, from sebum secreted by the head. The build up of the sebum causes the hair to have a dirty feel and an unattractive appearance. The soiling of the hair necessitates it being shampooed with frequent regularity. Shampooing the hair cleans by removing excess soil and sebum. However, the shampooing process has disadvantages in that the hair is left in a wet, tangled and generally unmanageable state. A variety of approaches have been developed to alleviate the after shampoo problems. These range from the inclusion of hair conditioning aids in shampoos to post shampoo application of hair conditioners, i.e., hair rinses. Hair rinses typically work by depositing a polymeric film or other material onto the hair. However, such solutions to a very prevalent problem have not been fully satisfactory. For one thing, hair rinses are generally liquid in nature and must be applied in a separate step following the shampooing, left on the hair for a length of time, and rinsed with fresh water. This, of course, is time consuming and is not convenient. While shampoos have been disclosed which contain conditioning aids, they have not been totally satisfactory for a variety of reasons. One problem relates to compatibility problems between good cleaning anionic surfactants and the fatty cationic agents which are good conditioning agents. This has caused other surfactants such as nonionics, amphoterics and zwitterionics to be examined by workers in the field. Many of these efforts are reflected in patents issued in the conditioning shampoo area. See for example The use of these other surfactants solved many of the compatibility problems but still did not provide complete answers in all areas. For instance cationic conditioners may not deliver the desired level of softness desired by users. Materials which can provide increased softness are silicones, both those which are soluble as well as insoluble in the shampoo matrix. Silicones in shampoo compositions have been disclosed in a number of different publications. Such publications include It is an object of the present invention to provide a stable silicone containing conditioning shampoo. It is a further object of the present invention to provide silicone shampoo compositions containing xanthan gum. It is a further object of the present invention to provide shampoos which provide good conditioning e.g., ease of combing, softness, feel, etc. to hair. It is a further object of the present invention to provide an improved method of shampooing and conditioning hair. These and other objects will become readily apparent from the detailed description which follows. Unless otherwise indicated, all percentages and ratios herein are by weight. According to the present invention, there is provided a shampoo composition comprising The essential and optional components of the present invention are given in the following paragraphs. An essential component of the present compositions is a synthetic anionic surfactant. The surfactant is present at a level of from 5 to 50 , preferably from 10 to 30 . Synthetic anionic detergents useful herein are alkyl and alkyl ether sulfates. These materials have the respective formulae ROSO₃M and RO C₂H₄O Specific examples of alkyl ether sulfates of the present invention are sodium coconut alkyl triethylene glycol ether sulfate lithium tallow alkyl triethylene glycol ether sulfate and sodium tallow alkyl hexaoxyethylene sulfate. Highly preferred alkyl ether sulphates are those comprising a mixture of individual compounds, said mixture having an average alkyl chain length of from about 12 to 16 carbon atoms and an average degree of ethoxylation of from about 1 to 4 moles of ethylene oxide. Such a mixture also comprises from about 0 to 20 by weight C₁₂ ₁₃ compounds from 60 to 100 by weight of C₁₄ ₁₅ ₁₆ compounds, from about 0 to 20 by weight of C₁₇ ₁₈ ₁₉ compounds from about 3 to 30 by weight of compounds having a degree of ethoxylation of 0 from about 45 to 90 by weight of compounds having a degree of ethoxylation of from 1 to 4 from about 10 to 25 by weight of compounds having a degree of ethoxylation of from 4 to 8 and from about 0.1 to 15 by weight of compounds having a degree of ethoxylation greater than 8. Additional examples of anionic synthetic detergents which come within the terms of the present invention are the reaction product of fatty acids esterified with isethionic acid and neutralized with sodium hydroxide where, for example, the fatty acids are derived from coconut oil sodium or potassium salts of fatty acid amides of methyl tauride in which the fatty acids, or example, are derived from coconut oil. Other anionic synthetic detergents of this variety are set forth in US A 2,486,921 US A 2,486,922 and US A 2,396,278. Still other anionic synthetic detergents include the class designated as succinamates. This class includes such surface active agents as disodium N octadecylsulfosuccinamate tetrasodium N 1,2 dicarboxyethyl N octadecylsulfo succinamate diamyl ester of sodium sulfosuccinic acid, dihexyl ester of sodium sulfosuccinic acid dioctyl esters of sodium sulfosuccinic acid. Other suitable anionic detergents utilizable herein are olefin sulfonates having about 12 to about 24 carbon atoms. The term olefin sulfonates is used herein to mean compounds which can be produced by the sulfonation of olefins by means of uncomplexed sulfur trioxide, followed by neutralization of the acid reaction mixture in conditions such that any sultones which have been formed in the reaction are hydrolyzed to give the corresponding hydroxy alkanesulfonates. The sulfur trioxide can be liquid or gaseous, and is usually, but not necessarily, diluted by inert diluents, for example by liquid SO₂, chlorinated hydrocarbons, etc., when used in the liquid form, or by air, nitrogen, gaseous SO₂, etc., when used in the gaseous form. The olefins from which the olefin sulfonates are derived are mono olefins having 12 to 24 carbon atoms, preferably 14 to 16 carbon atoms. Preferably, they are straight chain olefins. Examples of suitable 1 olefins include 1 dodecene 1 tetradecene 1 hexadecene 1 octadecene 1 cicosene and 1 tetraeosene. In addition to the true alkene sulfonates and a proportion of hydroxy alkanesulfonates, the olefin sulfonates can contain minor amounts of other materials, such as alkene disulfonates depending upon the reaction conditions, proportion of reactants, the nature of the starting olefins and impurities in the olefin stock and side reactions during the sulfonation process. A specific olefin sulfonate mixture of the above type is described more fully in US A 3,332,880. Another class of anionic organic detergents are the β alkyloxy alkane sulfonates. These compounds have the following formula where R₁ is a straight chain alkyl group having from 6 to 20 carbon atoms, R₂ is a lower alkyl group having from 1 preferred to 3 carbon atoms, and M is a water soluble cation as hereinbefore described. Specific examples of β alkyloxy alkane 1 sulfonates, or alternatively 2 alkyloxy alkane 1 sulfonates, having low hardness calcium ion sensitivity useful herein to provide superior cleaning levels under household washing conditions include potassium β methoxydecanesulfonate, sodium 2 methoxytridecanesulfonate, potassium 2 ethoxytetradecylsulfonate, sodium 2 isopropoxyhexadecylsulfonate, lithium 2 t butoxytetradecylsulfonate, sodium β methoxyoctadecylsulfonate, and ammonium n propoxydodecylsulfonate. Another suitable class of anionic surfactants are the water soluble salts of the organic sulfuric acid reaction products of the general formula wherein R₁ is chosen from the group consisting of a straight or branched chain, saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical having from 8 to 24, preferably 12 to 18, carbon atoms and M is a cation. Important examples are the salts of an organic sulfuric acid reaction product of a hydrocarbon of the methane series, including iso , neo , ineso , and n paraffins, having 8 to 24 carbon atoms, preferably 12 to 18 carbon atoms and a sulfonating agent e.g., SO₃, H₂SO₄, oleum, obtained according to known sulfonation methods, including bleaching and hydrolysis. Preferred are alkali metal and ammonium sulfonated C₁₂ ₁₈ n paraffins. Many additional nonsoap synthetic anionic surfactants are described in McCUTCHEON S, DETERGENTS AND EMULSIFIERS, 1984 ANNUAL, published by Allured Publishing Corporation. Also US A 3,929,678 discloses many other anionic as well as other surfactant types. The above mentioned surfactants can be used alone or in combination in the shampoo compositions of the present invention. The alkyl sulfates, the ethoxylated alkyl sulfates and mixtures thereof are preferred for use herein. The non volatile silicone fluid may be either a polyalkyl siloxane, a polyaryl siloxane, a polyalkylaryl siloxane or a polyether siloxane copolymer and is present at a level of from 0.1 to 10.00 preferably from 0.5 to 5.0 . Mixtures of these fluids may also be used and are preferred in certain executions. The dispersed silicone particles should also be insoluble in the shampoo matrix. This is the meaning of insoluble as used hereinbefore and hereinafter. The essentially non volatile polyalkyl siloxanes that may be used include, for example, polydimethyl siloxanes with viscosities ranging from 5 to 600,000 mm².s ¹ centistokes at 25 C. These siloxanes are available, for example, from the General Electric Company as the Viscasil RTM series and from Dow Corning as the Dow Corning 200 series. The viscosity can be measured by means of a glass capillary viscometer as set forth in Dow Corning Corporate Test Method CTM0004, July,20, 1970. Preferably the viscosity ranges from 350 mm².s ¹ centistokes to 100,000 mm².s ¹ centistokes . The essentially non volatile polyalkylaryl siloxanes that may be used include, for example, polymethylphenylsiloxanes having viscosities of 15 to 65 mm².s ¹ centistokes at 25 C. These siloxanes are available, for example, from the General Electric Company as SF 1075 methyl phenyl fluid or from Dow Corning as 556 Cosmetic Grade Fluid. The essentially non volatile polyether siloxane copolymer that may be used is, for example, a polypropylene oxide modified dimethylpolysiloxane e.g., Dow Corning DC 1248 although ethylene oxide or mixtures of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide may also be used. References disclosing suitable silicones include the previously mentioned Xanthan gum is the agent used in the present compositions to suspend the silicone fluid. This biosynthetic gum material is commercially available and is a heteropolysaccharide with a molecular weight of greater than 1 million. It contains D glucose, D mannose and D glucuronate in the molar ratio of 2.8 2.0 2.0. The polysaccharide is partially acetylated with 4.7 acetyl. This information and other is found in Whistler, Roy L. Editor Water is the last essential component of the present invention and forms the remainder of the composition. It is generally present at a level of from 20 to 95 , preferably from 60 to 85 . The shampoos herein can contain a variety of nonessential optional components suitable for rendering such compositions more acceptable. Such conventional optional ingredients are well known to those skilled in the art, e.g., pearlescent aids such as ethylene glycol distearate preservatives such as benzyl alcohol, methyl paraben, propyl paraben and imidazolidinyl urea cationic surfactants such as cetyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, stearyldimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride, and di partially hydrogenated tallow dimethylammonium chloride thickeners and viscosity modifiers such as a diethanolamide of a long chain fatty acid e.g., PEG 3 lauramide , amine oxides, block polymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide such as Pluronic F88 offered by BASF Wyandotte, fatty alcohols such as cetearyl alcohol, sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, polyvinyl alcohol, and ethyl alcohol pH adjusting agents such as citric acid, succinic acid, phosphoric acid, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, etc. perfumes dyes and, sequestering agents such as disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate. Such agents generally are used individually at a level of from about 0.01 to about 10 , preferably from about 0.5 to about 5.0 by weight of the composition. Another optional ingredient and one preferred for use in certain of the compositions of this invention, is a volatile silicone or a water insoluble hydrocarbon. These agents are disclosed in The pH of the present compositions is not critical and may be in the range of from 4 to about 10. The shampoos of the present invention can be made in the following manner The present compositions are used in a conventional manner for cleaning hair. From 0. 1g to 10g of a composition is applied to hair that has been wetted, generally with water, worked through the hair and then rinsed out. The following Examples further describe and demonstrate the preferred embodiments within the scope of the present invention. The Examples are given solely for the purpose of illustration and are not to be construed as limitations of the present invention as many variations thereof are possible without departing from its scope. The above compositions are stable and deliver good conditioning to hair that is washed with them. If in the compositions other anionic surfactants such as alpha olefin sulfonates or alkyl glyceryl sulfonates, are used in place of those listed, similar results are obtained. Similarly if silicones of other viscosities and types, such as those listed on pages 6 8, are used in place of those listed, similar results are obtained.
