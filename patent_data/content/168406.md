## Description
This invention relates to numerical data processors, and, more particularly, to the generation in a numerical data processor of certain condition codes resulting from defined floating point arithmetic operations. This application has been filed in the United States of America as Patent Application No. 567,830 on January 3, 1984. In integer 2 s complement arithmetic, every reprsentable bit pattern has a numeric value. In the proposed IEEE standard relating to floating point real number system formats, several types of values are defined for purposes of this description, denormalized numbers may be treated the same as very tiny normalized numbers. The currently proposed standard for floating point numbers proposed by the IEEE requires, among other things, that It shall be possible to compare floating point numbers in all supported formats even if the operands formats differ...Four mutually exclusive relations are possible less than , equal , greater than , and unordered . The last case arises when at least one operand is NaN. Every NaN shall compare unordered with everything, including itself. Comparisons shall ignore the sign of zero so 0 0 . In known floating point condition code generation systems, the above relations are generated directly, through the use of complex logic, from the magnitude relationships between the two operands. This requires extensive logical operation and circuitry. Accordingly, it is an object of the instant invention to provide an improved method and apparatus for generating floating point condition codes that can then be used to test for the four required relations. The foregoing object of the instant invention is accomplished by providing a method for producing floating points condition codes resulting from any arithmetic or move operations comprising the steps of Figure 1 is a block diagram of a data processor which utilizes the present invention. Figure 2 is a flow diagram illustrating the instruction processing sequence of the data processor of Figure 1. Figure 3 is a flow diagram detailing the operand tagging sequence in the instruction processing sequence of Figure 2. Figure 4 is a logic diagram showing logic which may be utilized to generate certain condition codes in accordance with the invention. Shown in Figure 1 is a data processor 10 which is constructed in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention. In operation, processor 10 executes instructions generally in accordance with the flow diagram shown in Figure 2. Although processor 10 is capable of executing several different types of instructions, the present invention is primarily directed toward those instructions which specify any of a plurality of different numerical operations to be performed upon an operand which may have any of a plurality of different data formats. for the purposes of the present invention, such numerical operations may be either monadic such as sin, arctan, square root, etc. or dyadic such as add, multiply, etc. while the data formats may be different in length such as byte, word, long word, etc. . Such a processor is also capable of operating on data of different forms such as integer, BCD, floating point, etc. but emphasis will be on floating point operations. Initially, a bus interface unit 12 loads each instruction to be executed by processor 10 into an instruction register 14. Although the bus interface unit 12 could be a bus controller such as that shown and described in US Patent No. 4,348,722, the preferred implementation is in the form of a coprocessor interface such as that shown and described in copending application serial number 485,672 , Zolnowsky et al, filed April 18, 1983 and assigned to the assignee of the present invention. In either form, the bus interface unit 12 initiates instruction execution by enabling a A programmable logic array PLA 16 to provide to a next microaddress multiplexor 18 the microaddress of an execution initiation microsequence. Simultaneously, an A1 PLA 20 selects the microaddress of a preprocessing microsequence appropriate for the particular operation class OP of the instruction i.e. memory to register, register to register or register to memory and, if necessary, the data format of the source operand RX. Assuming that micromachine 22 is initially idle, multiplexor 18 will be enabled to immediately forward the A microaddress to the micromachine 22. In the preferred form, the execution initiation microsequence delays the micromachine 22 until the A1 PLA 20 has had time to resolve, before enabling multiplexor 18 to forward the A1 microaddress to micromachine 22. If the class of the instruction is, for example, memory to register, the preprocessing microsequence called by the A1 PLA 20 will initially direct micromachine 22 to cooperate with the bus interface unit 12 in loading the source operand into one of several operand registers 24. The preprocessing microsequence will then enable micromachine 22 to control an execution unit 26 in a series of operand manipulation steps in order to convert the original source operand into an internal data format. This converted operand is preferrably retained in a working register not shown in execution unit 26. In the preferred form, the particular internal data format will be carefully chosen so as to be a superset of all of the available data formats. for example, assume that operands can be expressed as integers in lengths of one 1 byte, word, long word as base 10 floating point numbers in packed binary coded decimal BCD form or as base 2 floating point numbers in single, double or extended precision. Except for a few special cases, such as inaccuracies which inevitably occur in converting from base 10 floating point to base 2 floating point, an operand in any of these diverse formats can be converted into the base 2 extended precision floating point format without loss of either range or precision. Similarly, after the desired numerical operation has been performed, the result can be converted back into any of these formats while preserving as much range and precision as would have been possible if the operand had not been converted at all. In this example, the base 2 extended precision floating point format is the desired superset and is the preferred internal data format. If the operand which is being loaded from memory is already in base 2 extended precision floating point format, no format conversion as such is required. However, the exponent form used externally is typically biased by the hexidecimal value 3FFF, while the preferred form used within execution unit 26 is biased by 1 in order to facilitate two s complement manipulation. Accordingly, the preprocessing microsequence in the preferred form will direct micromachine 22 to step execution unit 26 through a brief series of manipulations which rebias the exponent of the operand in the working register. Similarly, if the class of instruction is register to register, the preprocessing microsequence will simply direct the micromachine 22 to load an operand from the appropriate one of the operand registers 24 into execution unit 26 and then to step execution unit 26 through the exponent rebiasing sequence. After the operand format conversion or exponent rebiasing is complete, the preprocessing microsequence directs micromachine 22 to tag the resultant operand as to data type. For the purposes of the present invention, the operand can be any of four 4 data types normalized NORM zero ZERO infinity INF or not a number NAN . For an extended precision floating point operand, the normalized data type includes normalized , i.e. having an exponent greater than or equal to the minimum possible exponent but less than the maximum possible exponent and a non zero significand having a most significant bit MSB of one 1 denormalized , i.e. having a minimum exponent and a non zero significand having an MSB of zero and unnormalized , i.e. having an exponent greater than the minimum but less than the maximum and a non zero significand having an MSB of zero . The ZERO data type, on the other hand, has an exponent equal to the minimum and an all zero significand while the INF data type has an exponent equal to the maximum and an all zero fraction. Finally, the NAN data type has an exponent equal to the maximum and a non zero fraction. As shown in Figure 3, the tagging portion of the preprocessing microsequence initially enables micromachine 22 to clear a source operand tag STAG register 28 and a destination operand tag DTAG register 30 by simultaneously asserting both an increment source tag INST signal and an increment destination tag INDT signal to a decoder 32. The tagging microsequence then directs the micromachine 22 to enable execution unit 26 to compare the exponent of the operand to the maximum possible exponent. If execution unit 26 signals not equal , micromachine 22 is then directed to enable execution unit 26 to determine if the significand of the operand is all zeros. One convenient way to perform this test is to complement the significand, add one 1 and watch for a carry out. If execution unit 26 signals no carry out , the significand of the operand must be non zero, and the tagging microsequence, having successfully determined that the operand is normalized, may exit leaving a value of in STAG 28. On the other hand, if execution unit 26 signals carry out , the significand must be zero, and the tagging microsequence will enable micromachine 22 to increment STAG 28 by asserting only INST to decoder 32, and then exiting leaving a value of 1 in STAG 28. If the execution unit 26 signals that the exponent of the operand is equal to the maximum exponent, the tagging microsequence will enable micromachine 22 to increment STAG 28 by two 2 by twice asserting INST to decoder 32. Micromachine 22 is then directed to enable execution unit 26 to determine if the fraction portion of the significand is all zeros. As before, if execution unit 26 signals carry out , the fraction must be zero, and the tagging microsequence, having determined that the operand is infinity, may exit leaving a value of 2 in STAG 28. If, on the other hand, execution unit 26 signals no carry out , the fraction must be non zero, and the tagging microsequence will enable micromachine 22 to increment STAG 28 by asserting INST once to decoder 32, and then exiting leaving a value of 3 in STAG 28. Upon completion of the tagging of the source operand, the preprocessing microsequence enables micromachine 22 to load a destination operand which may be meaningless if the selected operation is not dyadic from the appropriate one of the operand registers 24 into a working register not shown in execution unit 26. The preprocessing microsequence will again execute the tagging microsequence to tag the destination operand. This time, however, the tagging microsequence does not enable micromachine 22 to clear STAG 28 and DTAG 30, but simply proceeds to analyze the destination operand for data type. By the end of the tagging microsequence, the value in DTAG 30 will reflect the appropriate code as described above. Upon completing the tagging of the destination operand, if any, the preprocessing microsequence directs micromachine 22 to enable an A2 PLA 34 to provide the microaddress of an operation execution microsequence which is appropriate for the particular numerical operation indicated in the extension EX portion of the instruction register 14. The preprocessing microsequence will then exit after directing micromachine 22 to enable multiplexor 18 to forward the A2 microaddress. Often, when the operand s have one of the special data types i.e. zero, infinity or NAN , the result of a particular numerical operation will be a default value e.g. zero, infinity, etc. . In order to detect as early as possible such special cases as divide by zero, multiply by infinity or an operand which is a NAN, the operation execution microsequence selected by A2 PLA also depends upon the tag information in STAG 28 and DTAG 30. Assuming initially that the operand s are tagged as normalized, then the A2 PLA will provide the microaddress of the actual operation execution microsequence. Depending upon the selected numerical operation, the operation execution microsequence will enable micromachine 22 to control execution unit 26 in an appropriate series of steps to accomplish the operation. The operation execution microsequence will then direct micromachine 22 to post any exceptions incountered in performing the operation. In the preferred form, such exceptions include overflow, underflow, inexact rounded result , divide by zero, and invalid operation. In contrast, assume now that the operand s are tagged as one of the special data types i.e. zero, infinity or NAN . In this case, the A2 PLA will provide the microaddress of a special operation microsequence which, if appropriate, will simply direct micromachine 22 to store the default result in the destination operand register 24, before posting the corresponding exception if any. From just this aspect of the present invention, three very significant benefits are realized the operation execution microsequences are relieved of the duty of detecting and handling special cases, thus allowing faster operation execution all such special cases are handled very fast since no calculation need be done and substantial microcode space is saved since these special operation microsequences can be shared by all instructions. After posting any exceptions, both the operation execution and special operation microsequences direct micromachine 22 to store the result which is still in a working register not shown in execution unit 26 back into a selected one of the operand registers 24. The micromachine 22 will then be enabled to set the appropriate condition codes and log any posted exceptions into a status register not shown within bus interface unit 12 for use by the user. Multiplexor 18 will then be enabled to forward the A microaddress if and when the next instruction is received for execution. In the preferred form, the clocks are also stopped to save power, and bus interface unit 12 will restart the clocks only when the next instruction has been loaded into instruction register 14. If the instruction class is register to memory, indicating that a previously calculated result is to be stored into memory, the preprocessing microsequence called by the A1 PLA 20 will initially direct micromachine 22 to load a particular source operand from one of the several operand registers 24 into execution unit 26. The preprocessing microsequence will then direct micromachine 22 to perform the tagging microsequence to tag the source operand. Upon completing the tagging of the source operand, the preprocessing microsequence directs micromachine 22 to enable an A3 PLA 36 to provide the microaddress of an operand conversion microsequence which is appropriate for the converting the source operand from the internal data format to the external data format indicated in the instruction. The preprocessing microsequence will then exit after directing micromachine 22 to enable multiplexor 18 to forward the A3 microaddress. Depending upon the selected external data format, the operand conversion microsequence will then enable micromachine 22 to control execution unit 26 in a series of operand manipulation steps in order to convert from the internal data format into a selected one of the several external data formats. The operand conversion microsequence will then direct micromachine 22 to post any exceptions encountered in performing the operation. After posting any exceptions, both the operand conversion microsequence directs micromachine 22 to cooperate with bus interface unit 12 to store the result which is still in a working register not shown in execution unit 26 into a selected location in external memory not shown . The micromachine 22 will then be enabled to set the appropriate condition codes and log any posted exceptions into a status register not shown within bus interface unit 12 for use by the user. Multiplexor 18 will then be enabled to forward the A microaddress if and when the next instruction is received for execution. In the preferred form, the clocks are also stopped to save power, and bus interface unit 12 will restart the clocks only when the next instruction has been loaded into instruction register 14. The condition codes sent to the status register of the bus interface unit 12 contains four condition codes which may be set at the end of all move and arithmetic instructions involving the floating point data registers except for the move multiple instructions. The condition codes are Since data type is closely related to data format, the condition codes may be generated in one of the following ways For an implementation which produces arithmetic results in one of the IEEE standard s rigidly defined basic formats single or double , the following table describes the data type in accordance with the smallest and largest normalized numbers for each format minexp and maxexp , respectively . For an implementation which produces arithmetic results in an extended format which conforms to the IEEE standard s loose definition the preferred definition in the present invention the following applies Since the IEEE standard does not rigidly specify data formats for extended precision, the following only describes the data type definitions of the present invention. The extended format utilizes an explicit integer part bit j . The standard permits an extended format to utilize either an implicit or explicit integer part bit. Also, the standard very loosely defines the reserved exponents used for the zero, infinity, denormalized and NAN data types. This implementation follows the conventions of the basic formats in its choice of reserved exponents for the extended format. However, these techniques could be easily adapted to any extended precision which conforms to the standard. To establish the FPCCs in the extended case Define a floating point mantissa significand as the bit string The following definitions describe hardware elements latches Both C_OUT and MAXEXP could be either the output of a hardware comparator or internal AU conditions. The following equations describe the logic required for setting FPCCs on an implementation which produces extended format results Note that the FPCCs do not distinguish between normalized and denormalized numbers. This capability could easily be implemented by defining an additional hardware element A D FPCC bit would be useful in an implementation which produced results in a basic format. Since the present invention produces results in an extended format, a D bit as defined in this section would only indicate extended precision denormalized numbers which occur very infrequently . As previously noted, the proposed IEEE standard defines the following four relations and mandates their generation only as a result of a floating point compare operation. The processor of the present invention is capable of generating these relations at the end of all move and arithmetic instructions involving the floating point data registers except for the move multiple instructions The unordered relation occurs when one or both of the operands in a floating point compare is a NAN. It is significant that the setting of the condition codes is independent of the operation executed the condition codes simply indicate the data type of any result generated. It has been discovered that by using this set of condition codes the IEEE defined relations can be derived from the data type of the result. This is different from conventional processors where the setting of integer condition codes is dependent upon the These condition codes are used to generate the IEEE relations by using the following formulas Ultimately, in a floating point processor, to be useful, these condition codes and relations are used to cause conditional branches or traps to be taken or identified for each meaningful combination of conditions. In the instant invention, these condition codes are used to affirm or disaffirm 32 predicates. The following table gives the 32 predicates used For a given host processor instruction the predicate of interest is loaded into the Bus Interface Unit 12 by the host processor whereupon the logic shown in Figure 4 combines the predicate and the floating point condition codes FPCCs to generace a T F output to the host. The host processor then uses this output to cause a conditional branch or trap to be taken if true and not taken if false.
