## Description
Advanced composites are high strength high modulus materials which are finding increasing use as structural components in aircraft, automotive, and sporting goods applications. Typically, they comprise structural fibers such as carbon fibers in the form of woven cloth or continuous filaments embedded in a thermosetting resin matrix. In many advanced composites, the matrix contains an epoxide resin and an aromatic amine hardener. Such composites have high compressive strengths, good fatigue characteristics, and low shrinkage during cure. However, since the matrix resins are brittle, the composites have poor impact resistance and tensile properties which do not fully translate the properties of the reinforcing fiber. Thus, there is a need for matrix resins which afford composites with improved impact resistance and tensile properties in combination with the high compressive strengths typical of this class of materials. It has now been found that a composition which contains a specific group of hardeners, an epoxy resin and a thermoplastic polymer, when combined with a structural fiber, produces composites which have improved impact resistance, improved tensile properties and high compressive properties. The composition of this invention comprises The diamine hardeners which are used in this invention are represented by the following general formula wherein the X s are independently selected from a direct bond, O, S, SO₂, COO, C CF₃ ₂, C R₁R₂ ₂ wherein R₁ and R₂ are independently hydrogen or alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The preferred hardeners are selected from one or more of the following compounds These diamines may be used in combination with conventional aromatic diamines. Examples of conventional diamines include 4,4 diaminodiphenyl ether, 4,4 diaminodiphenyl methane, 4,4 diaminodiphenyl sulfone, 3,3 diaminodiphenyl sulfone, m phenylenediamine, p phenylenediamine, 4,4 diaminodiphenylpropane, 4,4 diaminodiphenyl sulfide, 1,4 bis p aminophenoxy benzene, 1,4 bis m aminophenoxy benzene, 1,3 bis m aminophenoxy benzene, and 1,3 bis p aminophenoxy benzene. The compositions according to the present invention also contain where n has a value from about 0 to about 15, or with an epoxidized novolak resin of the formula where The copolymers of the bis 2,3 epoxycyclopentyl ether with ethylene glycol can be those which are described in US Patent 3 398 102. Regarding the components that can be mixed with the bis 2,3 epoxycyclopentyl ether the following should be mentioned Useful polyglycidyl compounds are made via condensation reactions with 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, also known as bisphenol A, and have structure II where n has a value from about 0 to about 15. These epoxides are available commercially under the trade names such as Epon 828 , Epon 1001 , and Epon 1009 from Shell Chemical Co., and as DER 331 , and DER 334 from Dow Chemical Co. The most preferred bisphenol A epoxy resins have an n value between 0 and 10. Polyglycidyl derivative of phenolformaldehyde novolaks The former are commercially available as D.E.N. 431, D.E.N. 438, and D.E.N. 485 obtained from Dow Chemical Co. . The latter are available as, for example, ECN 1235, ECN 1273, and ECN 1299 obtained from Ciba Geigy Corporation, Ardsley, NY . As adducts derived from amines can be used N,N diglycidyl toluidine and N,N,N ,N tetraglycidyl 4,4 diaminodiphenyl methane. Polyhydroxyethers can be used as thermoplastic polymers, e.g. those of formula VIII where R is the residuum of a dihydric phenol such as bisphenol A, hydroquinone, resorcinol, 4,4 biphenol, 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone, 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfide, 4,4 dihydroxy 3,3 ,5,5 tetramethyldiphenyl sulfide, and the like, and the average value of n is between about 8 and about 300. Other suitable thermoplastics include polyetherimides such as the Ultem resins obtained from the General Electric Company polyarylates such as those derived from bisphenol A and isophthalic and terephthalic acid and polysulfones. The composition may additionally contain an accelerator to increase the rate of cure. Accelerators which may be used herein include Lewis acids amine complexes such as BF₃ . monoethylamine, BF₃ . piperidine and BF₃ . 2 methylimidazole amines, such as imidazole, 4 ethyl 2 methylimidazole, 1 methylimidazole, 2 methylimidazole, and N,N dimethylbenzylamine acid salts of tertiary amines, such as the p toluene sulfonic acid imidazole complex and dicyandiamide. The structural fibers which are useful in this invention include carbon, graphite, glass, silicon carbide, poly benzothiazole , poly benzimidazole , poly benzoxazole , alumina, titania, and other ceramic fibers, boron, and aromatic polyamides. These fibers are characterized by a tensile strength of greater than 6.9 . 10³ MPa, a tensile modulus of greater than 13.8 . 10³ MPa, and a decomposition temperature of greater than 200 C. The fibers may be used in the form of continuous tows 1000 to 300,000 filaments each , woven cloth, whiskers, chopped fiber or random mat. The preferred fibers are polyacrylonitrile based carbon fibers, aromatic polyamide fibers, such as Kevlar 49 fiber obtained from E. I. duPont de Nemours, Inc., Wilmington, DE , and silicon carbide fibers. The compositions contain 15 to 60 weight percent, preferably 15 to 50 percent, of hardener i.e., component a , 10 to 60 percent, preferably 15 to 50 percent, of component b, and 1 to 25 percent, preferably 2 to 20 percent by weight of component c. When used in combination with a reinforcing fiber, the resinous portion i.e., a b c comprises between about 15 to about 95 percent by weight of the composition. In a preferred embodiment, the compositions of this invention are used to make prepreg a ready to mold sheet of reinforcement impregnated with partially advanced or B staged resin. Prepreg may be prepared by several techniques known in the art, such as wet winding or hot melt. One way of making impregnated tow or undirectional tape involves passing the fiber through a bath of the epoxy hardener thermoplastic mixture. A non reactive, volatile solvent such as dichloroethane may optionally be included in the resin bath to reduce viscosity. After impregnation, the reinforcement is passed through a die to remove excess resin, sandwiched between plies of release paper, passed through a set of heated rollers, cooled, and taken up on a spool. Alternatively, prepreg may be made by two step process, which in the first step, involves coating a thin film of the epoxy hardener thermoplastic mixture on release paper. In the second step, a ribbon of fibers is sandwiched between two plies of coated release paper and then subjected to heat and pressure for a short period to melt the resin into the fibers. After one ply of release paper is removed, the impregnated tape is wound up on a spool, using the other ply of release paper as a spacer. During both methods of prepreg manufacture, the resin partially advances. Typically prepreg is stored at 17.8 C or below to retard the rate of resin advancement. In some applications it may be desirable to prereact a portion of the epoxy resin with the hardener prior to prepreg manufacture. For example, if an epoxy blend containing 80 percent by weight of bis 2,3 epoxyclyclopentyl ether and 20 percent of a liquid bisphenol A resin is reacted with 4,4 bis 4 amino phenoxy diphenyl sulfone, it is beneficial to prereact the hardener with the bisphenol A epoxy resin prior to addition of bis 2,3 epoxycyclopentyl ether. The prereacted epoxy hardener mixture has a lower melting point than the pure hardener, making it easier to blend with the remaining portion of the epoxy blend. Composites may be prepared by curing preimpregnated reinforcement using heat and pressure. Vacuum bag autoclave cures work well with these reinforced compositions. Laminates may also be prepared via wet layup followed by compression molding, resin transfer molding, or by resin injection, as described in European Patent Application Publication number 0019149 published November 26, 1980. Typical cure temperatures are 27.8 C to 260 C, preferably 66 C to 232 C. The compositions of this invention are well suited for filament winding. In this composite fabrication process, continuous reinforcement in the form of tape or tow either previously impregnated with resin or impregnated during winding is placed over a rotating and removable form or mandrel in a previously determined pattern. Generally the shape is a surface of revolution and contains end closures. When the proper number of layers are applied, the wound form is cured in an oven or autoclave and the mandrel removed. For making preimpregnated tape with tack and drape, the preferred resin composition contains greater than 60 percent by weight of bis 2,3 epoxcyclopentyl ether in the epoxide component, 4,4 bis 3 aminophenoxy diphenyl sulfone i.e. I as the hardener, and a polysulfone such as Udel polysulfone P 1800, obtained from Union Carbide Corp. , or phenoxy resins such as UCAR Phenoxy Resin Type PKHH, obtained from Union Carbide Corp. as the thermoplastic modifier. Coepoxides such as bisphenol A epoxy resins of Formula II where n 0 to 5, or epoxidized novolak resins of Formula III or IV where n 0 to 4 may be blended with bis 2,3 epoxycyclopentyl ether for this application. If additional tack is required, glycidyl amines such as N,N diglycidyl aniline or N,N,N ,N tetraglycidyl 4,4 diaminodiphenyl methane may be used as a coepoxide. In general, prepreg shelf life increases as the proportion of cycloaliphatic epoxy resin in the epoxy component increases. If tack and drape retention over a period of several days is not required, 4,4 bis 4 aminophenoxy diphenyl sulfone or 4 3 aminophenoxy 4 4 aminophenoxy diphenyl sulfone may be used as the hardener. For all prepreg and composite formulations, the preferred molar ratio of N H groups in the hardener to 1,2 epoxide groups in the epoxy resin is 0.6 to 1.5. All thermoplastics used in this invention have number average molecular weights above 1500, and preferably above 2000. Although desirable from a processing point of view, it is not essential that the epoxide hardener thermoplastic mixture be homogeneous. If incompatible thermoplastics are used, they should be ground so that they pass through a 0.59 mm screen, preferably a 0.297 mm screen. When cured, the thermoplastic component may or may not be optically compatible with the epoxide hardener phase. The compositions of this invention may be used to prepare composites for use as aircraft parts such as wing skins, wing to body fairings, floor panels, flaps, and radomes as automotive parts such as driveshafts, bumpers, and springs, and as pressure vessels, tanks and pipes. These composites also suitable for protective armor on military vehicles and sporting goods applications such as golf shafts, tennis racquets, and fishing rods. In addition to their use as matrix resins, these compositions are also suitable for coatings, adhesives, and potting compounds. The following examples serve to give specific illustrations of the practice of this invention but they are not intended in any way to limit the scope of this invention. The following designations used in the Examples have the following meaning The epoxy equivalent weight EEW is the grams of epoxy resin per mole of 1,2 epoxide group. Udel Polysulfone P 1800 obtained from Union Carbide Corporation having a number average molecular weight of about 24,000. Ucar Phenoxy PKHH obtained from Union Carbide Corporation having a number average molecular weight of about 24,000. A solution was prepared by blending 394 g of Polysulfone with 2400 g of bis 2,3 epoxycyclopentyl ether and 600 g of Dow D.E.N. 438 epoxidized novolak resin at 120 C for 1 hour.

A solution of Polysulfone in bis 2,3 epoxycyclopentyl ether was prepared by heating 181.5 g of Polysulfone with 1100 g of the diepoxide for 1.5 hours at 130 C. This solution was cooled to 70 C and was blended with 137.5 g of a bisphenol A epoxy resin EEW 240 and 137.5 g of N,N diglycidyl ortho toluidine Glyamine 135, from F.I.C. Corp. San Francisco, CA . A thermosetting epoxy resin formulation was prepared by combining a 1334 g portion of this solution with 1138 g of 4,4 bis 3 aminophenoxy diphenyl sulfone. A 5 liter flask equipped with a paddle stirrer, nitrogen inlet, thermometer with a Therm o Watch controller, Claisen adapter, 304.8 mm jacketed Vigreux column, Barrett trap, water cooled condenser, a nitrogen inlet, and an electric heating mantle was charged with the following materials The mixture was stirred, purged with nitrogen, and heated to 80 C. Then 229 g of The mixture was then cooled to 70 C and filtered. A 350 g portion of the filtrate was then charged to a 5 liter flask containing 2 liters of methanol. This solution was heated and stirred at reflux as 1300 g of water was added over a 1 hour period. Following addition of water, heating was discontinued, but agitation continued as the contents cooled to room temperature about 25 C . The cooled mixture contained a tan granular solid, which was recovered on a filter, washed once with hot water, and dried in a vacuum oven. The final product weighed 133 g and had a melting range of 150 163 C. It was a mixture of 4,4 bis 4 aminophenoxy diphenyl sulfone, 4,4 bis 3 aminophenoxy diphenyl sulfone and 4 3 aminophenoxy 4 4 aminophenoxy diphenyl sulfone. A solution of bisphenol A polyhydroxyether in bis 2,3 epoxycyclopentyl ether was prepared by heating and stirring 200 g of Phenoxy with 1466 g of the diepoxide at 120 C for 1.8 hr. The resulting solution was cooled to 70 C and blended with 366 g of N,N diglycidyl ortho toluidine Glyamine 135 . A thermosetting resin formulation was prepared by combining 70.0 g of this thermoplastic epoxy resin blend with 70.0 g of 4,4 bis 3 aminophenoxy diphenyl sulfone. Unreinforced castings were prepared from the formulations described in Examples 1 through 4 and 6. Typical castings weighed 100 to 160 g and were made using the proportions given in the above Examples. Casting dimensions were 3.2 203.2 127 to 203.2 mm. The general procedure for making castings was as follows The epoxy resin and thermoplastic were charged to a 3 necked flask equipped with a paddle stirrer. The contents of the flask were heated to 120 C to 130 C and stirred. The amine hardener was added to this solution as a fine powder. It dissolved in about five minutes. The resulting solution was subjected to a vacuum of about 635 mm of mercury for three minutes with agitation, followed by two minutes without agitation. It was then poured into a glass mold with a cavity of dimensions 3.2 203.2 203.2 mm, and cured with a programmed heating cycle 16 to 21 hours at 105 C, 8 hours at 140 C, and finally 16 hours at 175 C. Castings were tested to determine tensile properties, heat deflection temperature and water sensitivity. For the latter, the change in weight on immersion of tensile bars in water after two weeks was recorded. Tensile properties were measured according to ASTM D 638 using a Type 1 dogbone specimen. Heat deflection temperatures were measured according to ASTM D 648 1822 kPa stress . Table I summarizes the properties of unreinforced castings. These materials have low water sensitivity, high tensile strengths, and high tensile moduli compared to castings of many other epoxy formulations. Example 12 describes the preparation of undirectional epoxy graphite prepreg. The epoxy resin formulation described in Example 1 was heated in a flask under nitrogen at 120 5 C for 70 minutes in order to partially advance it. After the solution was cooled to 80 C over a 40 minute period, it was coated on 203.2 mm wide release paper type 2 BKG 1 and 99D, obtained from Daubert Coated Products, Dixon, III. at a coating weight of about 0.58 kg cm². 152.2 mm wide undirectional prepreg tape was made by forming a ribbon from 74 tows of carbon fiber and contacting it between two plies of epoxy coated release paper in a prepreg machine. In the prepreg machine, the sandwich of fiber and coated release paper passed over a series of heated rollers to melt the resin into the fibers. The finished tape contained about 45 percent by weight of fiber. 152.2 mm wide undirectional prepreg tape was prepared using the resin formulations in Examples 2, 3 and 4. A control prepreg Control A was also made. The general procedure is described in Example 12. The heat history of each formulation prior to coating is summarized in Table II. Examples 16 through 19 describe the cured laminates made from the prepreg in Examples 12 through 15. The laminates were cured in an autoclave using bleeder cloths to absorb excess resin. Between 5 and 10 plies of prepreg was used to make each specimen. Tensile properties were measured according to ASTM D3039. Compressive properties were measured using a modified ASTM D695 procedure. Unidirectional graphite epoxy tabs were added to prevent the sample ends from crushing in a noncompressive failure mode. A gage length of approximately 4.83 mm was used. End tabs on compressive samples were adhered using FM 300 film adhesive obtained from American Cyanamid Company, Havre de Grade, MD , which was cured at 177 C for 1 hr. Table III summarizes the longitudinal properties measured on undirectional laminates. It is clear that these compositions have excellent tensile and compressive properties. The tensile properties of laminates made with Fiber B are significantly higher for the resin formulations of this invention than for the laminate made with the Control resin. Examples 20 through 22 show compressive strengths after impact of quasiisotropic laminates fabricated with the compositions of this invention. This test measures the damage tolerance of composites. The latter depends on the choice of matrix resin. All test specimens were made with Fiber B and had dimensions of 152.4 101.6 approximately 5.1 mm. The panels were impacted in the center with a Gardner type Impact Tester Gardner Laboratories, Bethesda, MD having a 15.88 mm diameter spherical indenter. The impact was normal to the plane of the fibers. When impacted, the laminate was simply supported over a 76.2 mm by 127 mm cut out in an aluminum plate with a plywood backup. The impacted panel was tested for residual compressive strength in a steel fixture that constrained the edges from out of plane buckling. In this test, residual compressive strengths decrease as the impact load increases. The preferred samples have the highest residual compressive strengths at a given impact level. It is clear that the residual compressive strengths of laminates made with the compositions of this invention are significantly higher than that of the control. Thus, the compositions of this invention have improved damage tolerance.
