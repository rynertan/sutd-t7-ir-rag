# Rotary actuator.

## Abstract
A rotary actuator 10 is operable under the influence of fluid pressure to rotate a driven member. The rotary actuator 10 includes a drive member 18 which extends into a chamber in a housing. Helical splines 62 interconnect a pis ton 44 and the drive member 18 to rotate the drive member 18 upon axial movement of the piston 44 in the chamber 22 . The piston 44 is held against rotary movement relative to the housing 14 in one embodiment by a pair of rollers 130, 132 that engage tracks 124, 126 disposed on opposite sides of the piston 44 and in another embodiment by a corresponding oval shaped configuration of a portion of the piston and an internal portion of the chamber in the housing. In one embodiment of the invention, a rack gear on the piston rotates a pinion to actuate a valve and restrict fluid flow to the chamber when the piston is approaching an end of stroke position. A one way clutch may be connected with the drive member so that the driven member is only rotated in one direction rather than being oscillated upon back and forth movement of the piston.
