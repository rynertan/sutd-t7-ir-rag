## Description
This invention relates to aqueous dispersions of water insoluble solids, especially pigments, dyestuffs and optical brightening agents. It has been normal practice in the printing of polyester textile materials with disperse dyestuffs tu thicken the print pastes with materials of natural origin, such as alginates, but dissatisfaction with their technical performance coupled with a general world shortage of these natural thickeners has led to an increase in the use of certain synthetic thickening agents, such as polyacrylic acid and its derivatives and homologues, which have recently become available. Although these synthetic thickeners are generally superior to the established natural thickeners in many respects, they have one serious defect in that the viscosity of print pastes made with these thickeners is very sensitive to the presence of ionic species which generally cause a severe depression of viscosity.This defect has caused problems irX the use of synthetic thickeners with print pastes containing disperse dyestuffs. These latter are usually dispersed with anionic dispersing agents and the dispersions therefore contain large quantities of ionic species. The depression of viscosity of print pastes based on synthetic thickeners when ionic species are added can be overcome to some extent by increasing the quantity of the synthetic thickesler but this reduces the commercial acceptability of these thickeners because an important advantage of synthetic thickeners over the natural thickeners is the smaller concentration required, hence the lower cost, to achieve a given viscosity, in the absence of ionic species. A lower level of thickener concentration is also technically desirable because this reduces the amount of washing off required and also reduces interference in the absorption of dyestuff by the textile material. In order to accomodate disperse dyestuff dipsersions in print pastes containing synthetic thickeners it has been proposed to replace the anionic dispersing agents with non ionic dispersing agents, see for example UK 1537374. Non ionic agents have, of course, been used for many years in the stabilisation of pigment dispersions but few of the established non ionic agents have proved to be satisfactory for the preparation of dispersions of disperse dyestuffs and particularly such dispersions which are designed for incorporation in print pastes based on synthetic thickeners. It has been proposed, in Japanese Patent Specification Kokai No.54 30220 Hodogaya to prepare aqueous dispersions of perchlorate salts of basic dyestuffs using poly ethylene oxy derivatives of phenols and naphthols and to use such dispersions in aqueous print pastes containing natural or synthetic thickeners. The print pastes based on synthetic thickeners however contained sufficient thickener 15 to 20 to have thickened a conventional dispersion of a disperse dystuff containing an anionic dispersing agent. Furthermore the present applicants have found that the dispersions disclosed in theJapanese specification cannot be used to prepare print pastes of acceptable viscosity unless excessive quantities of thickener are used i.e. from about 5 to 10 times the normal usage. A serious defect of dispersions based upon non ionic agents, hereinafter referred to as non ionic dispersions , is that they are not sufficiently stable to withstand the more exacting conditions involved in dyeing processes, e.g. higher temperatures, and they may also adversely affect the performance of vat and cellulose reactive dyes which are frequently used in conjunction with disperse dyes in the colouration of polyester cellulose blends. It has been proposed in Japanese Patent Specification Kokai No. 53006689 Kao Soap to prepare dispersions of disperse dyestuffs using as dispersing agents phosphated or sulphated condensates of aromatic compounds with a lower alkylene oxide, the condensates containing at itast 35 alkylene oxy units. It has also been proposed, for example in UK 1518434, UK 2035384A and OLS 2614257, to add aliphatic or long chain alkylphenol sulphated or phosphated ethylene oxide adducts to conventional dispersions of disperse dyes containing anionic dispersing agents in order to improve the storage stability of the dispersions or to reduce the explosion hazards during drying. In UK 1518434 it is also stated that the use of such agents in conventional dispersions enhances the colour yield during pad dyeing. It has now been found that dispersions of disperse dyes which are compatible with synthetic thickening agents and which are also suitable for use in the continuous dyeing of polyester and polyester cellulose textile materials can be prepared using, as dispersing agents, certain aromatic compounds carrying phosphate or sulphate groups These agents are also suitable for use in the preparation of dispersions of other solids. The agents are are hereinafter referred to as crypto ionic to distinguish them from the truly anionic agents which have much stronger ionic activity and from the non ionic agents which have no ionic activity. According to the present invention there is provided an aqueous dispersion of a finely divided, water insoluble solid containing a water soluble, crypto ionic dispersing agent of the formula EMI3.1 wherein R is an aryl or arylene group which is free from aliphatic substituents containing 6 or more carbon atoms Y is O , CH2 0 or CO.O m n is from 3 to 30 p is from 1 to 3 q is 1 or 2 X is SO4 and r is 2 p, or X is P04 and r is 3 p and M is H, NH4, a substituted ammonium radical or an alkali metal. The aryl or arylene group represented by R preferably comprises a single benzene ring or a pair of benzene rings which are fused or linked together either directly or indirectly. The benzene rings may be substituted by non hydrophilic groups other than aliphatic chains containing 6 or more carbon atoms and as examples of such substituents there may be mentioned halogens, particularly chlorine and lower C1 to C4 alkyl groups.Examples of radicals represented by R are phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, chlorophenyl, phenylphenyl, diphenylene, 2,2 bis 4 phenylene propane 2,2 b 4 pp , from bis phenol A, and naphthyl. As examples of the substituted ammonium radicals represented by N there are those derived by neutralisation of aliphatic and aromatic amines and hydroxyamines, which are free from aliphatic chains containing more than 6 carbon atoms, such as C1 to C4 alkylamines, C1 to C4 hydroxyalkylamines, arylamines and pyridine. A preferred species of M is the triethanolammonium radical. It is preferred that n m and that the sum of n and m is from 3 to 25 and more especially from 4 to 15. It is also preferred that m is not greater than 5 and more preferably is zero and that n is from 5 to 10. The dispersing agent may comprise a mixture of compounds in which p is from 1 to 3. The crypto ionic agents may be prepared in a known manner by reacting the appropriate alkylene oxide or oxides with a compound of the formula R Y B 11 q wherein R, Y and q have the meanings defined hereinbefore, and esterifying the polyalkylene oxide condensate with an appropriate oxyphosphorus or oxy sulphur compound, for example, phosphorus pentoxide, chlorosulphonic acid and sulphamic acid. Synthetic methods are described in further detail in Surface ActiveEthylene Oxide Adducts by N.Schonfelt Pergamon, 1969 ,Organophosphorus Compounds by G.M.Kosolapoff Wiley, 1950 andUSP 2758977 Knowles et al . Although the dispersions are particularly suitable for use with synthetic thickeners in the preparation of print pastes and so the preferred solids are disperse dyestuffs, the dispersing agents of formula I are also suitable for use in the preparation of dispersions of other solids such as pigments, particularly organic pigments, optical brightening agents and anthraquinone, the dispersion of anthraquinone being suitable for use in wood pulping operations for promoting delignification. As examples of the water insoluble dyestuffs and pigments which may be incorpbrated in the present dispersions there are mentioned non ionic, organic pigments and disperse dyestuffs of the azo, anthraquinone and phthalocyanine series and inorganic pigments such as metal oxides, iron blues and cadmium yellows. In addition to the dispersing agent of formula I and the water insoluble solid the dispersion may contain other additives such as anti microbials, humectants and other surfactants. If the dispersion is to be used in the preparation of a print paste containing a synthetic thickener it is preferred that such additives are non ionic in order to avoid depression of the viscosity of the print paste. The dispersion preferably contains from 5 to 70 , by weight of the solid, based on the total weight and from 5 to 100 , by weight of the dispersing agent, based on the weight of the solid, especially preferred ranges being from 10 to 60 and from 10 to 70 respectively. The mean diameter of the particles of the solid is preferably below 5 microns and more preferably below 3 microns. The present dispersion may be prepared by any method for the preparation of finely divided dispersions of solids in aqueous media, for example, by grinding the solid together with the dispersing agent in water in a bead or u ball mill until the mean particle diameter of the solid is below 5 microns and more preferbably below 3 microns. As indicated hereinbefore the dispersions of the present invention, wherein the solid is a colourant, i.e. a pigment or a dyestuff, are particularly suitable for the preparation of print pastes and according to a further feature of the present invention there is provided an aqueous print paste comprising afinely divided water insoluble inorganic or non ionic organic colourant, a dispersing agent of Formula I3 and a thickening agent. The term thickening agent includes both natural and synthetic thickening agents and preferred print pastes are those containing a disperse dyestuff and a thickening agent, especially a synthetic thickening agent. The term synthetic thickening agent includes all those agents, suitable for the thickening of print pastes, which are not derived directly from natural products and, as examples there may be mentioned polyacrylates, such as polyacrylic acid and its derivatives and homologues, polyvinyl alcohol and ethylene maleic anhydride co polymers.The term natural thickening agent includes all those agents, suitable for the thickening of print pastes, which are derived directly from natural products and, as examples of natural thickening agents there may be mentioned, locust bean mannogalactau gum, guar gum mannogalactan , sodium algiuates, polysaccharides, starch ethers, hydroxylated and carboxylated starch ethers and oil in water emulsions. Although the present dispersions have been developed, like tha wholly non ionic dispersions, to cope with the increasing use of synthetic thickening agents they show advantages over both the conventional anionic dispersions and the more recently developed non ionic dispersions in print pastes based upon natural thickeners in terms of better colouration yields and or better dispersion stability in the print paste. A print paste based on a natural thickening agent preferably contains from 4 to 5 of the thickening agent whereas one based on a synthetic thickening agent preferably contains from 0.5 to 1.5 of the thickening agent. The weight of colourant may vary within wide limits depending on the depth of shade of print required and preferred proportions of the dispersing agent, in relation to the colourant, are those indicated hereinbefore in respect of the dispersions. The print paste may be prepared in any convenient manner, a preferred method, in the case of a disperse dyestuff dispersion, being to dilute the dispersion with water and to add a concentrated solution of the thickening agent with vigorous agitation. Any other ingredients, such as wetting agents, fixation promotors and preservatives, may then be added Lo the paste. The present dispersions, in which the solid is a disperse dyestuff, are also suitable for use in the continuous dyeing of polyester textile materials and, in conjunction with suitable vat or cellulose reactive dyestuffs, in the continuous dyeing of polyester cellulose blends. Inthe dispersions designed for use in continuous dyeing it is preferred to use agents of formula I in which p is 1. In continuous dyeing procedures it has been found that the present dispersions are superior to non ionic dispersions because the former are more resistant to flocculation in the padding liquor under normal continuous dyeing conditions. It has also been found in the continuous dyeing of polyester cellulose blends with mixtures of disperse and vat dyes that the present dispersions are superior to non ionic dispersions because the latter restrain the vat dyes and reduce the yield of these dyes on the cellulose portion of the blend. An important advantage of the present dispersions over conventional anionic dispersions is that they do not stain either polyester materials or adjacent textile materials which may be coloured in conjunction with polyester. This means that the present dispersions permit the attainment of brighter shades both on polyester material and adjacent materials than is possible with most anionic dispersions which stain textile materials. All aqueous dispersions tend to lose water by evaporation leading to an increase in concentration and ultimately to the deposition of dry solid. To reduce the tendency for evaporation it is customary to add a humectant, usually a polyol, to the dispersion. The most popular humectants are those like glycerol, ethylene glycol and sorbitol, which are rich in primary hydroxyl groups because they not only inhibit evaporation but also,assist in the protection of the dyestuff particles if drying out occurs. A serious problem with such humectants is that they compete with cellulose for cellulose reactive dyes, when these are used in conjunction with disperse dyestuffs for the colouration of polyester cellulose blends, and thus reduce the yield of the cellulose reactive dye on the cellulose. It is therefore desirable to move away from these humectants to those which are much less reactive with cellulose reactive dyestuffs. Suitable less reactive humectants are those low in, or free from, primary hydroxyl groups, such as propylene glycol and dipropylene glycol. Unfortunately these humcectants are incompatible with the conventional anionic dispersing agents when there are only small amounts of water present, i.e. when drying out of the dispersion has occurred, and this results in the failure of the dye to redisperse after the dispersion has dried out. This failure to redisperse leads, in practice, to specking of the textile material during printing and dyeing. The crypto ionic agents used in the present invention are compatible with a wide range of humectants, including propylene and dipropylene glycols, when loss of water occurs.Thus formulations prepared from the present crypto ionic agents and these preferred humectants can readily be redispersed, after drying out, by gentle agitation in water. As they contain the less reactive humectants, these dispersions have a reduced effect on the dyeing yields of cellulose reactive dyes during the one bath, continuous dyeing of polyester cellulose blends. Although most commercially available aqueous dispersions of disperse dyestuffs contain humectants to reduce evaporation, in normal commercial practice it is virtually impossible to prevent evaporation and almost inevitably the user, the dyer or printer, will be faced with the need to redisperse dried out material. The redispersibility of dyestuffs sold in a liquid dispersion is therefore a commercially important property. The crypto ionic agents used in the present dispersions give particularly good protection against drying out so that merely stirring the dried out solid back into the dispersion, or added water, is sufficient to give a fine, deflocculated dispersion which will give dyeings and printings substantially free from specks. The invention is further illustrated by the followingExamples. Unless otherwise stated, all parts and percentages are by weight.Example 1 14.4 G of the dispersing agent of Formula I wherein R is naphth 2 yl, Y is O , m is O, n is 10, q is 1, p is 1,X is P04 and M is H, were dissolved in 20 g of water. The pH was adjusted to 7.0 by the addition of 12.4 g of a 10 solution of ROH and 1.2 g of a 20 solution of potassium 2 phenylphenate. 11.4 G of water and 16.1 g of dipropylene glycol humectant were then added to the solution. 44.5 G of a press paste of the dyestuff, 2 acetylamino 4 N,N di beta methoxycarbonyl ethyl aminoi 4 1 nitroazohenzene, containing 24 g of dyestuff and 20.5 g of water were homogenised into the above solution by mixing for 10 minutes with a high shear Silverson mixer. The dyestuff slurry was stirred in a stainless steel, water cooled vessel with 360 g of 0.35 to 0.5 mm diameter glass beads. Agitation was effected by three axially aligned 60 mm diameter nylon discs mounted 25 mm apart on a common stainless steel shaft rotating at 3000 revolutions per minute. After 40 minutes agitation the mean diameter of the dye stuffs particles was below 2 microns and the dispersion was deflocculated. The dispersion, containing 20 dyestuff and 16 dispersing agent was separated from the glass beads by filtration through a nylon mesh with 50 micron pores.Example 2 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated using as dispersing agent the triethanolamine salt of the dispersing agent used in Example 1 with the addition of 0.1 g of an antifoaming agent Synprol 6PO . The dispersion was ground for a period of 50 minutes after which the mean diameter of the dyestuff particles was less than 2 microns and the dispersion was deflocculated.Example 3 The procedure of Example 2 was repeated omitting the antifoaming agent but adding 0.25 g of xanthanpolysaccharide Kelzan S , under high speed agitation, to the milled dispersion.Example 4 40 G of the dispersing agent described in Example 1 were added to 89 parts of water contained in a 1 litre vessel. The was was adjusted to 7.0 using a 40 aqueous solution of triethanolamine. To this solution were added 56 g of dipropylene glycol humectant and 4 g of a 20 aqueous solution of sodium 2 phenylphenate and the pH re adjusted to 7.0 with dilute acetic acid. 121.2 G of a press paste of the dyestuff, 2 chloro 4 nitrc 6 bromo 4 N N bis 2 methoxycarbonylethyl aminoazo benzene containing 80 parts of dyestuff and 41.2 parts of water, were stirred into the above solution together with sufficient water to raise the contents of the vessel to 400 g and the slurry homogenised for 20 minutes with a high shear mixer Silverson . The slurs was milled with 1200 g of glass beads Ballotini No. 8, 0.3 0.5 mm diameter in a 2 litre stainless steel vessel using a rotor fitted with three 10.3 cm diameter nylon discs set 2.3 cm apart, the rotor revolving at 1840 rpm peripheral speed 12 m sec until the mean diameter of the dyestuff particles, determined by microscopic examination, was between 1 and 3 microns. The milled dispersion was separated from the beads by filtration through nylon mesh with 25 micron pores. This dispersion is hereinafter referred to as Dispersion E4.Example 5 The procedure of Example 4 was repeated except for an increase in the quantity of the dispersing agent to 48 g and the replacement of the 121.2 g of dyestuffs press paste by 148.2 g of a press paste of the dyestuff described in Example 1 containing 80 parts of dyestuff and 68.2 parts of water. This dispersion is hereinafter referred to as Dispersion E5.Example 6 44.2 G of the dispersing agent described in Example 1 were dissolved in 64 parts of water and the pH adjusted to 7.0 with a 40X aqueous solution of triethanolamine. To this solution were added 50 g of dipropylene glycol humectant and 4 g of a 20 aqueous solution of sodium 2 phenylphenate and the pH re adjusted to 7.0 with dilute acetic acid. 174.6 G of a press paste of the dyestuff, 3 4 num methoxyethoxy ethoxycarbonyl phenylazo 4 methyl Scyano 6 hydroxy N ethylpyrid 2 one, containing 110 g of dyestuff, were added to this solution together with sufficient water to raise the total slurry to 400 g. The slurry was homogenised and milled as described in Example 4 and is hereinafter referred to as Dispersion E6. Example 7 33 G of the dispersing agent described in Example 1 were dissolved in 66 g water and the pH adjusted to 7.0 with a 1M aqueous solution of KOH. To this solution are added 57.8 g of glycerol humectant and 4 g of sodium 2 phenylphenate and the pH readjusted to 7.0 with dilute acetic acid. 173.3 G of a press paste of the dyestuff, 2 bromo 4,6 dinitro 2 acetylamino 5 methoxy 4 N methoxyethoxy carbonyl ethylaminoazobenzene containing 66 g of dyestuff, were added to this solution together with sufficient water to raise the total slurry to 400 g. The slurry was homogenised and milled as described in Example 4 and is hereinafter referred to asDispersion E7.

Test 1 Dispersibility Test The quantity of a dispersion which contains 20 g of single strength colour was added to 400 g water in a beaker and stirred for a fixed period with a standardised stirrer the same stirrer and stirring period was used for every assessment . After stirring the dispersion was allowed to stand for 30 seconds and the top 300 g of material decanted, the remainder being filtered through a filter cloth with a mean pore size of 25 microns, under a slight vacuum. The cloth was then air dried and any deposition assessed on a 1 to 5 scale analogous to the Standard Grey Scale in which the rating 1 indicated a complete absence of deposit and the rating 5 a thick deposit over the cloth. For commercial acceptibility, i.e. to pass this test, a dispersion must achieve a rating of 2 3 or lower. Ratings of 3 or above are recorded as failures.Test 2 Redispersibility Test A standard quantity 2g of each dispersion was placed in a 250 ml beaker and swirled around the side until the side of the beaker was evenly wetted by the dispersion to a height of 1 . The beaker was then stored at room temperature until dry to a constant weight. The dry product was then redispersed in 100 ml water at 55 C by repeated transfer of the liquor between two beakers until no further deposited material was removed from the side and base of the beaker. The redispersed material was then filtered, under vacuum, through two 7 cm Whatman No 4 filter papers dressed over a 6 cm diameter 100 mesh gauze and the papers air dried. The deposition was assessed on a 1 to 5 scales inTest 1, with rating 1 indicating complete redispersion and the absence of any coarse particles and rating 5 indicating incomplete redispersion, i.e. material remaining on side or base of beaker and a heavy deposit of coarse particles on the filter paper. To pass this test a dispersion must achieve a rating of 2 3 or lower. Ratings of 3 or above are recorded as failures.

In the following assessments only the underlined portions of the above rating comments are used in the tables of results.Recipe 3 Print Paste with Synthetic Thickener Dispersion 5 parts Thickener 95 parts solution of 2.5 of Lyoprint TFA and 1.0 of Lyoprint yoprint TFB in water 100 partsLyoprint TFA is a high molecular weight polyacrylic acid andLyoprint TFB is a lower molecular weight polyacrylic acid. Both these compounds are obtainable from Ciba Geigy. Lyoprint is a trade mar the property of Ciba Geigy The solution of the thickener was stirred into the dispersion. This print paste was applied to a polyester crepe material using a Zimmer, laboratory, flat bed, printing machine with a bar 6 and a magnet setting of 4. The prints were assessed in the same manner as for Recipes 1 and 2 and the same ratings were used. In the following Assessments the prefix E indicates that the dispersion is an Example of the invention, the prefix CD indicates that the dispersion is not an Example of the invention but for the purpose of comparison and the suffix A indicates that the dispersion was made according to the method of the appropriate Example or Comaparative Dispersion except for omission of the humectant.Assessment of Dispersions E10 and E40 to E44 The dispersions were assessed according to Test 1 for dispersibility and Test 2 for redispersibility and samples of the dispersions were converted into print pastes according to Recipe 1 and Recipe 2 and the print pastes assessed for speckiness of print on a polyester crepe fabric. The results of the assessments are summarised in Table 6.

The results are summarised in Table 7.

Assessment of Dispersions in Continuous Dyeing Various of the present and comparative dispersions were used to prepare dyebaths for continous dyeing and samples of polyester textile material were dyed using the dyebaths under conventional continuous dyeing conditions. The dyeings were assessed for colour strength and the results are summarised inTable 8. Table 8 Dispersion Relative Dyeing strength CD5 100 E4 108.5 E34 108.5 E36 103 E35 103 CD2 90.5 CD6 100 E5 104.5 E10 98 E16 100 E13 103 CD3 92 CD7 100 E6 105 E37 105 E38 105 E39 105 CD4 95 The results shown in Table 8 demonstrate that a range of the present dispersions give dyeings which are equal, or even superior, in strength to conventional anionic dispersions CD5 toCD7 , which are known to have good high temperature stability, in contrast to the dispersions based upon non ionic dispersing agents CD2 to CD4 which give much lower strength dyeings indicating instability in the dyebath.Assessment of Dispersions for Redispersibility Various dispersions falling within the present invention were assessed for redispersibility in accordance with Test 2 and the results are compared in Tables 9 and 10 with the results for certain of the comparative dispersions.

Assessment of Dispersions E4 and E34 to E36 againstDispersions CD2 and CD5 in Dyeing polyester cotton blends in conjunction with Vat dyes A pad liquor was made up with the following formula Dispersion 32.0 g l Vat Dye liquid 20.6 g l Levelling Agent 10.0 g l and applied to a polyester cotton fabric by padding through a horizontal bowl mangle set tp give an expression of pad liquor equal to 55 of the fabric weight. The fabric was then dried by passing through an infra red zone in a baking unit to transfer the disperse dye into the polyester. The vat dye was reduced by padding with a solution of NaOH 80 g l and sodium hydrosulphite 80 g l and steamed for 60 minutes. Oxidation of the vat dye was carried out in a bath containing sodium perborate 3 g l and the fabric then soaped at the boil for 15 minutes.Polyester skeletons were prepared from potions of the dyed materials by dissolving out the cotton with sulphuric acid.The results of the assessments are set out in Table 11. Table 11Dispersion Relative Dyeing Strengths Blend Polyester Skeleton CD5 100 100 E4 95 90 E34 98 100 E35 97 90 E36 100 100 CD2 75 100 The results shown in Table 11 demonstrate the restraining effect of the closely related non ionic ethylene oxide condensate dispersing agents when dispersions containing them are dyed in conjunction with vat dyes. In the case of CD2 which contains as agent a condensate of 2 naphthol with 10 moles of ethylene oxide, the dyeing efficiency is only about 75 of CD, based on a conventional anionic dispersing agent, whereas the present dispersions E to E , and particularly E, which is a phosphated condensate of 2 naphthol with 10 moles of ethylene oxide, all give dyeing which are equal in strength to that of the anionic dispersion.This assessment thus shows the considerable advantage of the present dispersions over the most closely related non ionic dispersions.Assessment of the Agents used for the present Dispersions againstAnionic Agents for Staining In order to assess their fibre staining properties, the agents used in Dispersions E4, E10, E13, E16, CD5 and CD9 were applied to a variety of textile fibres under the appropriate conditions for the application of disperse dyes, but with no disperse dye present in the dyebath. This allowed the effect of the agents on the various fibres to be assessed without masking by the dyestuff. The details of the test procedures are summarised in Table 12. Table 12 Fibre Dyeing Conditions Comments 100 polyester pH 5.5 45 minutes dyed with and without at 1300C EBTA and with and without a reduction clear 55 polyester p11 5.5 45 minutes dyed with and without 45 wool at 106 C EDTA 67 polyester p11 5.5 45 minutes dyed with and without 33 cotton at 1300C EDTA 100 nylon 6,6 pH 5.0 6.0 dyed with and without 60 minutes at 960C EDTA All the dyeings were performed at 4 agent on fibre The agents used in the dispersions of the present invention all gave negligible staining on all the fibres tested. The lignosulphonate agent, from CD9, gave severe staining on all the fibres and although the staining of polyester and polyester cotton was reduced slightly by the presence of EDTA in the dyebath the staining of nylon at pH 5.0 and polyester wool was unaffected by EDTA. Reduction clearing did reduce the staining on polyester. The other anionic agent, from CD5, stained all fibres, although less intensely than the lignosulphonate. The stain is fairly insensitive to the presence of EDTA or changes in pH and reduction clearing does not fully remove the stain from polyester. These result demonstrate the clear advantage of the present agents over the conventional anionic agents which stain not only the fibre being dyed by the dispersion but also adjacent fibres. This advatage allows the production of brighter and clearer shades both on polyester and polyester blends.Assessment of Dispersions in Printing Applications Dispersions E45 and E46 were compared with ComarativeDispersions CD15, CD16, CD17, CD18, CDl9 and CD20 in print applications using print pastes made in accordance with Recipe 1 and Recipe 3 and the prints, on polyester crepe, assessed for speckiness and print definition. The same eight dispersions were also assessed for their performance in the Dispersibility 1 andRedispersibility 2 Tests. The results of the assessments are shown in Table 13.

Two 1 litre pad liquors were made up for each dispersion with the following formulae Content Pad Liquor 1 Pad Liquor 2 Dispersion 32.0 g l 2 g l Cellulose Reactive Dye 20.6 g l Levelling Agent 10.0 g l Fixing Agent 30.0 g l NH4112 P04 4.0 g l and both liquors were applied to separate 100 square inch pieces of a 67 33 polyester cotton blend, by padding with an expression of 55 on weight of fabric. The fabric was dried with IR irradiation and hot air and fixed in a thermosol unit at 2200 C. The dyeings for each dispersion with Pad Liquor 1 were assessed for relative dyeing strength and those with Pad Liquor 2 for dyeing quality, i.e. speckiness of the dyed material using the same scale as for the printed samples given above under Recipes 1 and 2. The results are shown in Table 14. Table 14Dispersion Dyeing Strength Dyeing Quality Pad Liquor 1 Pad Liquor 2 E45 S 90 100 free CD15 S 97 100 specky CD16 S 94 100 very CD17 S 96 100 litt E46 S 92 100 free CD18 100 100 litt CD19 100 i00 specky CD20 100 100 free The dyeing strength results demonstrate the higher dyeing yields achievable with the present dispersions compared with comparable anionic dispersions and also the higher yields achievable with dispersions containing DPG as humectant E45 andCD15 17 compared with those containing glycerol as humectant E46 and CD18 20 . The print quality results demonstrate the superior quality of the dyeings from the present dispersions regardless of of the humectant compared with the dyeings from the anionic dispersions. These results thus demonstrate the greater stability of the present dispersions in the dyebath.
