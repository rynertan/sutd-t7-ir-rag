# A semiconductor light emitting device.

## Abstract
Semiconductor lasers heretofore employed have no mechanism for stabilizing a lateral oscillation mode, and the light emitting region of the laser becomes wider as current increases. That is, the lateral oscillation mode is unstable. To avoid this problem a current rejecting layer 8 and an etch back preventive layer 9 are added to a semiconductor laser provided with a clad layer 2 having a projecting portion 2G, for confining light from an active layer 3, and other por tions from which light leaks. The thicknesses of certain layers, the relationships of forbidden band widths of the layers and their conductivity types are selected so that a current limit function and an optical guide function can be obtained, and the lateral oscillation mode can be stabilized.
