# METHOD AND MACHINE FOR FORMING A WRAP AROUND PACKAGE

## Abstract
Machine and method for forming a wrap around package accommodating a plurality of containers and of the type having a top panel 16 side wall panels 14, 18 and base panels 12, 20 providing a sleeve like structure and end panel structures at each end of the sleeve including an end panel 34,34a and tuck panels 38, 38a 40, 40a joined to the end panel by gusset panels 46, 46a 52, 52a . A first folding step deflects upwardly the side panels of the carton with respect to the top panel thereof in order to cause the tuck flaps to be folded into overlapping relationship with said panels. Thereafter, the side wall panels are caused to be folded downwardly with respect to the top panel whereby the tuck flaps are disposed between the containers being packaged and the side walls and finally the base panels are folded into overlapping relationship beneath the containers.
