# A PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF POLYETHERESTER POLYOLS AND THE PRODUCTS AND USE THEREOF

## Abstract
The invention provides a process for the production of polyetherester polyols which have hydroxyester groups terminally bound via ester groups to high molecular weight polyether polyol segments. These are produced by first reacting high molecular weight polyoxyalkylene ether polyols with molecular weights of from about 400 to 10,000 with an excess of dicarboxylic acids, dicarboxylic acid anhydrides or dicarboxylic acid esters, and then reacting the intermediate product in a further stage with an excess of diols, based on carboxyl groups. The new, high molecular weight polyetherester polyols thus consist of polyoxyalkylene ether segments, which have terminal ester segments in each case with terminal hydroxyl groups per end group. Moreover, the use is claimed of the high molecular weight polyetherester polyols as polyhydroxyl compounds for forming polyurethanes.
