# Wristwatch with pressure sensor.

## Abstract
An electronic diving wristwatch having a pressure sensing depth meter provided in a projection on a case of the watch without interferring with the existing crown, pushbut tons, etc. The depth meter has a piezoelectric type sensing element which produces electrical output in response to the water pressure. The output is converted to a water depth which is displayed in a digital display window of the watch.
