# A belt tracking mechanism e.g. for a belt sander.

## Abstract
A belt centering device automatically operable in a belt sander 10 of the type including spaced apart rolls 24,26 . The centering device is needed to keep the belt 28 from wander ing off a roll. The sander 10 includes adjustable mounting means 32,34 for supporting at least one roll 26 . An endless belt 28 is positioned around the rolls 24,26 and drive means are provided for the rolls 24,26 and belt 28 . Alignment means including a belt edge engaging means 72 are opera tively connected to the roll mounting means 32,34 , and a resilient force is applied by spring 50 to hold the engaging means 72 against a belt edge 74 as the belt 28 is moved by the drive means. This causes the engaging means 72 to follow variations in the belt edge position, and this movement is transmitted to the mounting means 32,34 whereby the variations are compensated.
