## Description
BODY IMPLANTABLE CUSHIONED LEADI. DESCRIPTIONBackground of Prior Art Electrical stimulation of the body for medical purposes is well known in the prior art. An example of a device for this purpose is the well known cardiac pacemaker. In the pacemaker context, as well as other body stimulation contexts, the stimulation is delivered to the desired body site by an electrode component of a lead. A variety of body implantable electrical leads for the delivery of electrical stimulation energy to a desired body site are known in the prior art. Recent years nave seen increased usage of transvenous leads which can deliver the stimulation energy to the desired body site while significantly lowering patient risk and morbidity.For example, the use of a transvenous endocardial lead eliminates the necessity of a thoracotomy while delivering stimulation energy to the heart to provide a pacemaking function. Such endocardial leads may be used for sensing as well as pacing. In many stimulation and sensing contexts, maintenance of a reliable electrical contact at the desired electrode site has proven difficult. Interactions between Ã­edGlead and the body at the contact site can vitiate the desired effects of the stimulation. For example, material reactions may encourage fibrosis. In the pacemaking context, fibrosis is believed to be a major factor in the increase in chronic threshold that is usually experienced. Also, mechanical trauma may result in inflanumation of the tissue to be stimulated. Such inflammation may alter the response of the tissue to the stimulation energy, Doth acutely and chronically. For example, in chronic use of such leads, it has been observed that the contractions of the heart against the distal end of the lead and the axial mechanical ores sure applied thereto ray ti aumatize tJle tissue in contact with the distal end. The traumatized tissue ray form scar tissue around the electrode s to r ltlte the effect of stress placed upon the endocardium below tile tissue damage limit.In cilronic experience, it is observed that the threshold currents sufficient to stimulate tulle heart in crease as the scar tissue is formed until the thickness of the scar tissue stabilizes. The required energy to stimulate the heart is thereby increased because of the additional potential drop across the nonresponsive cardiac cells. A discussion of this mechanism in conjunction with the realization of optimum electrode surface area appears in the paper entitled Comparison of Power Sources forAdvanced Pacemaker Applications by Rasor, Spickler andClabaugh, Proceedings of the Seventh Intersociety EnergyConversion Engineering Conference, January 1972, pages 752 760. Other interactions between the lead and body at the contact site, while not directly affecting the response of the tissue to the stimulation energy, can result in tile occurrence of undesirable events. In some circumstances where electrical stimulation of body tissue is indicated, the tissue to be stimulated is irritable. The placement of a pacemaking lead may induce a cardiac arrhythmia. The presence of the lead may also promote thrombus formation. Pressure induced trauma are known to be the leading cause of enlarged fibrotic encapsulation of the electrode tip. Cardiac tissue is occluded under the tip affecting a diffusion barrier to oxygen and other nutrients carried by the blood while also being deprived of the ability to transfer waste products from the tissue into the blood. A large number of tissue cells are so occluded by existing endocardial electrode tips. Cells of heart tissue must cofl0muni o te with the blood in the ventricles of the heart by way of diffusion due to the lack of capillaries near the endo caraial surface. The interactions noted above have long been recognized and efforts have made to ameliorate their consequences.For example, lads have been configured to reduce mechanical trauma and the response of irritable tissue during lead placement. Materials have been selected for the lead body and electrodes to minimize fibrosis. Thrombus formation may also be countered by the administration of suitable drugs. The administration of drugs to counter tile undesir able interactions between tibe lead and body noted above has not gained widespread acceptance in that it has heretofore required a systemic treatment to counter a localized interaction. Also, lead configuration must take into account other factors such as the efficiency of the delivery of the stimulation energy, the ease of lead placement, maintenance of the desired electrode position and reliability of the lead over extended periods of time. An accommodation of these interests has resulted in leads whose configuration necessarily results in undesirable interactions between the lead and body.Brief Summary of tile Invention The present invention provides a means for adapting presently available body implantable leads so as to ameliorate the effects of undesirable interactions between the lead and the contacted tissue. This is accomplished by providing the electrode contact surface with a cushioning body of a soft, compliant, water swellable, polymeric, water insoluble material inert to body tissues and fluids.The material consists essentially of a hydrogel which is ionically conductive. The hydrogel is permeable to water, oxygen, CO2 and the like so as to allow their diffusion through the cushioning body both to and away from the occluded tissue cells at the contact site. The water permeable hydrogel body is ionically conductive, thereby providing electrical communication between She metal electrode and the tissue. Lastly, due to the cushioning elect provided by the hydrogel body, a barrier is provided between the metal electrode alld the tissue which is capable of reducing mechanical stresses appJ.ieQ to the neart tissue thereby minimizing trauma effects at the contact site.Brief Description of the Drawings Figure 1 illustrates a portion of a body implantable lead constructed in accordance with the preferred bodi tiled or tne present invention. Figure 2 is an end view of the body implantable lead shown in Figure 1.Detailed Description of the Invention Referring to the Figures, there is illustrated a body implantable lead of the transvenous type, constructed in accordance with the invention. The lead body, generally designated 10, is comprised of a coiled, flexible conductor 11 and an overlying sheatii 12. Coiled, flexible conductor 11 may be of any known design and preferably has a central aperture which will accept a stylet not shown to provide stiffness during lead placement, in known manner. The lead body may also be non linear such that stylet insertion will straighten the lead body to facilitate transvenous placement, also in known manner.To facilitate the flexibility requirements of the present invention as well as for reliability considerations, flexi ble conductor 11 may be a multi filar member, three filars being illustrated in the drawing. Conductor 11 is in electrical communication with a tip electrode 13 and a source of stimulation energy not shown for the delivery of stimulation energy to the desired body site. Sheath 12 may be a preformed tubular member, preferably of a body compatible polyurethane, to overlie conductor 11 and pro ide electrical insulation tirerefor, in known nanner.Also, as known in the art, lead body 10 may be tined as indicated at 14 for purposes of fixation upon implantation. In the prior art, many body stimulation leads are formed of a molded silicone. A preferable material for sheath 12 and lead body 10 is a boO y cor. atibIe solw etilane. Such polyuretllanes meet the flexibility requirements of trans venous leads and are typically less thrombogenic than silicone and more resistant to tearing and cutting. In general, the physical characteristics of polyurethane ae more suited to transvenous leads than those of silicone, although silicone or any other body compatible material may be employed in practicing the present invention. Also, as is known in the art, metal electrode 13 may be provided in various configurations. Additionally, various metals may be used, such as stainless steel and titanium. A preferred platinum or platinum alloy tip electrode 13 provides a contact surface 15 as shown in theFigures. Heretofore contact surface 15 has for the most part contacted the tissue at the desired body site directly.Cushioning body 19 is carried and positioned on contacting surface 15 of electrode tip 13 so as to interpose between electrode tip 13 and the body tissue to be contacted.Present commercially available platinum leads may be modified according to the invention by simply attaching a cushioning body to the electrode contact surface or surfaces. Attachment may be accomplished by adhesive bonding, for example as promoted by silane adhesion promoters. A mechanical interlock may also be used. in the drawing, tip 13 is modified by forming invaginations 17 therein to provide attachment by means of mechanical interlock. Cushioning body 19 consists essentially of a hydrogel thick enough to allow for flexible contact between electrode tip 13 and the tissue contact site. Typically, thicknesses will range from about 1 micrometer to 1 millimeter.Such a cushioning body has been found to provide low mechanic cal trauma and high sensing and stimulation effectiveness with endocardial tissue. Cushioning body 19 acts to dampen lead body ,pressure and side to side motion between the electrode and the endocardial wall or other selected body contact site. The cushioning body thus enables a flexible attacllment to cevelop between tne electrode and the lLluerlying tissue. This flexible attachment or link reduces mechanically induced trauma between tissue and the electrode metal tip which is believed to be a cause of increased thickness in the fibrotic encapsulation of electrodes. Hydrogel polymers are ionically conductive, soft, compliant, water swellable and inert to body tissues and flui s. Cushioning body 19 is also ionically conductive and permeable thereby allowing electrical communication between electrode tip 13 and the contacted tissue as well as providing a diffusion path to and away from the occluded tissue site. Generally speaking, a hydrogel having the properties above described will comprise a coherent, three dimensional polymeric network capable of imbibing water without dissolving. Usually, insolubility in water is provided by a crosslinked structure in the polymer. Hydrogels or watercontaining gels may be comprised of water and various chemical substances including gelatin, polysaccharides, crosslinked acrylamide polymers, hydroxyethylmethacrylate polymers, crosslinked polyhydroxyethylacrylate, polymerized, crosslinked 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropane sulfonic acid or one of its salts such as the sodium or potassium type, crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyacrylic acid, copolymers of the aforementioned monomers with each other and copolymers of the aforementioned monomers with other monomers such as styrene or other non hydrogel type monomers. Hydrogels of low conductivity may be made conductive for purposes of this invention by incorporating salts such as sodium chloride or potassium chloride and like electrolytic salts in the hydrogel. This is most easily accomplished by dissolving a salt in a monomer waterInitiator solution and polymerizing. Other methods of preparation may also be used. ile preferred specific hydrogels are crosslinked polyacrylamide and crosslinked polymeri zed 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropane sulfonic acid or one of its salts. volume 15, pastes 273 291 of the Encyclopedia of Polyrer Science Technology 1971 , John Wiley Publishers, provides a section entitled HYDROGELS which describes the preparation of a variety of water imbibing polymers. The content thereof is incorporated herein by reference. ExAMPLE Polyacrylamide Hydrogel The following ingredients were dissolved in 52.5 grams of deionized water 40.0 grams acrylamide, 2.0 grams sodium chloride, 8.0 cc of 1 aqueous solution of methylene bis acrylamide. Nitrogen was vigorously bubbled through the resultant solution for 2.5 minutes. The following reagents were added to the solution simultaneously with stirring 0.5 cc of a .38 solution of potassium bisulfite, 0.5 cc of a .38 solution of potassium persulphate, and 0.5 cc of a .24 solution of ferrous sulfate.

The mold is then removed. A wide variety of lead oonfigurations, including bipolar as well as unipolar, and cushioning body configurations consistent with the tissue contacting requirements of the lead sld with the motion a osorbing requirements of the present invention may be utilized. It is, therefore, to be understood that, within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.
