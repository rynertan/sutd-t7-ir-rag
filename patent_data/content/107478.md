# Dispersing supply device in automatic weighing apparatus.

## Abstract
A dispersing supply device in an automatic weighing appa ratus includes a base plate 7 , a vibrator supported on the base plate by a pair of springs 8 , and a trough 10 supported on the vibrator by groups of leaf springs 23 , the trough being vibrated by the vibrator so as to convey articles from one end of the trough to the other. One dispersing supply device is pro vided for each of a plurality of weighing machines, and is dis posed between the corresponding weighing machine and a dis persing table so as to receive articles from the table and supply them to the weighing machine via the trough. The base plate is formed to include a mounting slot having a first portion of prescribed width and an elongate second portion narrower in width than the first portion. A mounting table to which the dis persing supply device is attached is provided with a projecting pin 20 having a head portion 20a . After the pin is passed through the first portion of the mounting slot provided in the base plate 7 , the base plate is slid to engage the pin with the second portion of the mounting slot, thereby attaching the dis persing supply device to the mounting table. By using such a pin and slot arrangement, the device is made easily demount able and can thus conveniently be removed for cleaning or ad justment.
