# Stable chemical compositions containing chromogenic materials and peroxides, and method for obtaining them.

## Abstract
Chromogenic materials which react to give a color reaction when in the presence of a peroxide ROOR min decomposing to give a radical oxygen are unstable when dissolved to give working solutions for use in chromogenic reactions. Compositions containing in addition to the chromogenic material also a peroxide needed in the said reaction are also unstable, leading to premature appearance of color. Stable chemical compositions containing chromogenic materials and stable compositions containing mixtures of chromogenic materials and peroxides are described, which can be used in chromogenic reactions after having been stored for long periods of time. Also described are stabilizing chemical compositions and methods for obtaining the said stable compositions.
