## Description
A novel process for preparing bromophenyl pyridyl allylaminesDESCRIPTIONTechnical fieldThe present invention relates to a novel process for preparing compounds having therapeutic activity. The invention is further related to the use of a compound as starting material or intermediate in preparation of a therapeutially active compound.Compounds of the formulaEMI1.1 wherein R represents hydrogen or methyl, having valuable therapeutic properties especially as antidepressants are known from Belgian Patent Specifications No. 781.105 andNo. 835.802. Further processes for preparing such compounds are known from the following Swedish patent applications No. 7605779 3, No. 7707707 1 and No. 7707708 9.Disclosure of inventionGeneral outlineA main object of the present invention is to provide a novel process for preparing compounds of formula I above as well as therapeutically acceptable salts thereof, said process having advantages over known processes. A further object is to provide a process for preparation of a compound of formula I in a desired diastereomeric form, and or permitting a stereospecific synthesis of a compound of formula I. Another pbject is to provide a convenient process for conversion between compounds of formula I in which R has different meaning or to enable the introduction or removal of a labelled secondary or tertiary amino function ih a compound of formula I. Further objects of the invention will be evident from the following description.Due to the lack of free rotation in the double bond the compounds of formula I exist in two stereoisomeric forms, that is in cis trans isomers or, according to the IUPAC nomenclature J. Org. Chem. 35, 2849 2867, September 1970 , in an E form and a Z form. The compound may be used therapeutically as a mixture of geometrical isomers or in pureE or Z form. For therapeutic purposes the Z isomers are preferred.The compounds of formula I may be prepared for administration in the form of free bases or their salts with non toxic acids. Some typical examples of these salts are the hydrobromide, hydrochloride, phosphate, sulphate, citrate, tartrate, malate, maleate and oxalate.The novel process of the present invention is characterized in making a reductive amination of an aldehyde of the formulaEMI2.1 with methylamine or dimethylamine in the presence of a reducing agent, to the formation of a compound of formulaI. Theireducing agent can be e.g. Raney nickel, sodium cyanoborohydride, lithium cyanoborohydridet boranes, sodium borohydride, formic acid formates, formamides or alcoholic sodium, alcoholic sodium amalgam, alcoholic metal hydrides or alcoholic potassium hydroxide. Alternatively, the reduction may be accomplished electrolytically with metal cathodes li ke platinum, lead or copper or with a metal acid system having a metal such as zinc.When formic acid is used as reducing agent, initial formation of a formate with the reagent methylamine or dimethylamine is suitably done.Preferably the process of the invention is carried out under non oxygen gas atmosphere at a temperature between 20 and reflux temperature of the solvent used.An important advantage of the process of the invention is providing possibilities of preparing the compound of formula I in a desired diastereomeric form. Thus a diastereomerically pure aldehyde may be aminated infra stereospecific way to the pure or substantially pure isomer of the amine of equal configuration. Preferably such stereospecific reduction is carried out with lithium cyanoborohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride in an alcoholic solution at a pH between 4 and 8 at 0 50 C, most preferably at room temperature, with an excess qf amine. Further, the starting material of formula II may be employed in any desired ratio of diastereomers to the obtention of an end compound of formula I with the same diastereomer ratio.Alternatively, a Z E mixture or a diastereomer of the aldehyde can be reductively aminated in a non specific way, e.g. using formic acid, a formate or formamide as reducing agent, giving an isomeric mixture of the amine from which subsequently any desired isomer can be.isolated. Such conditions can be especially useful when isomer conversion is desired. Thus, from a mother lye containing the E form of a compound of formula I an isomeric mixture of said compound may be prepared via the aldehyde, and the Z form may be isolated.An unexpected advantage of the invention is that the aldehyde of formula II is a stable and storable intermediate. This fact renders the process especially useful for production in a commercial scale. A further related advantage is that the aldehyde of formula II is preparable from a corresponding primary, secondary or tertiary allylamine as will be described below. This provides a practically advantageous process for conversion between different allylamines, one or both of which may satisfy formula I above. Interconversion between differentcompounds of formula I can thus conveniently be made, and further the amino funciton may be replaced with a labelled amino function, such as a tritium labelled amine, or such labelled amino function may be removed. In this respect the invention provides an efficient tool for pharmacological research. Starting materials Preparation of the starting materials for the process of the invention according to the formula II may be carried out as outlined below. Thus the starting material may be prepared by oxidation of a compound of formulaEMI4.1 wherein W is OH or a leaving group Y, NR R , NR H, NH2 orEMI5.1 wherein R and R are alkyl groups having 1 4 carbon atoms with reagents such as man.ganese dioxide, dimethyl sulfoxide, silver I , s ilver II , iron III , chromium trioxide reagents, aluminium alkoxides, nickel peroxide, lead tetraacetate and 2,3 dichloro 5,6 dicyano benzoquinone or by oxidation in one step from a compound of the formulaEMI5.2 wherein W is as defined above and preferable is OH or a leaving group Y, with an appropriate reagent mentioned above, such as chromic acid sulfuric acid. With appropriate choice of NR R or NR H the compounds of formula III also satisfy formula I. Thereby a conversion between different compounds of formula I is made possible, especially a stereospecific such conversion.The intermediate alcoholic of formula III and IV may be prepared by methods known in the art.A carboxylic acid may be prepared by further oxidation of the aldehyde mentioned above. Such carboxylic acid can be used for reductive amination to a compound of formula I.Working ExamplesPreparation of starting materialsExample A E 3 4 Oromophenyl 3 3 pyridyl 2 propenal A mixture of 2.0 g 16.3 mmol E 3 4 bromophenyl N,N dimethyl 3 3 pyridyl allylamine UV Table 1 and 10 g manganese dioxide Merck, gefallt in 40 ml chloroform was stirred at reflux under nitrogen.
