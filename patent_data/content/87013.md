# Durable primer composition.

## Abstract
A primer composition which has excellent durability when immersed in water is made from a silicone modified epoxy resin, an aminoxy silicon compound, and an organoti tanate. The primer composition is particularly useful for bonding room temperature vulcanizable silicone rubber or room temperature vulcanizable silicone modified organic rubber to building substrate materials.
