# Ink jet printers with ink drop compensation and method of ink drop compensation.

## Abstract
The flight path of drops from an ink jet printer nozzle are corrected to reduce print position error on the print media. It has ben found that drops as far as 30 drop positions ahead of a particular drop in the ink stream can have an effect on the flight path of that particular drop to the print media. Using a memory to store 2³⁰ compensation values to correct the flight of the drop for all possible combinations of drop patterns in the ink stream is not practical. A smaller number of compensation values are used to correct the flight path by grouping the drops remote in position from the drop being compensated into blocks of drops and treating each entire block of drops as contributing one effect on the flight of the drop. Accordingly, drops D₁ to D₇ close to the compensated drop are treated as having an individual effect on the flight path while drops remote from the compensated drop R are grouped into one or more blocks A, B, C and each block is treated as having a single effect on the compensated drop R.
