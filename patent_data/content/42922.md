## Description
INFRARED AND VISIBLE DUAL DYE INK FOR INK JET PRINTERS Description Technical FieldThis invention relates to inks for ink jet printing, and, more specifically, to a dual dye ink having good absorbence of light in both the visible and the infrared range. Background ArtInk formulations for jet printing ink require many different characteristics which have not been found in a suitable ink having a single dye. One important characteristic where machine character recognition is to be conducted is absorbence in the infrared range, specifically 800 to 900 millimicrons nm . This is because silicon photoconductors used in character recognition often have peak responses in that range.Absorbence in the visible range remains important so that the printing may be read conventionally. In U.S. Patent No.3,870,528 operative inks are disclosed having two dyes, nigrosine to absorb infrared radiation and Direct Black 4 or DirectBlack 38 to absorb in the visible range. The formulations of that patent would no longer be considered for actual use because both the Direct Black 4 and the Direct Black 38 are not now readily commercially available.Jet printing inks optimally satisfy a number of demanding criteria including 1 permanence after printing, particularly including resistance to water 2 virtually total freedom from agglomeration, both during use and in their storage environment 3 low toxicity 4 ideal characteristics of electrical conductivity, drop formation, and flight characteristics to conform with the printer design 5 consistent maintenance of desirable characteristics in varying environments where the ink might be stored or used 6 and economic and technical feasibility of manufacture and use of the ink in large quantities.A number of desirable characteristics, such as resistance to microorganisms and water fastness, are primarily obtained by the action of certain ingredients in the preferred formulations, as will be disclosed in detail below. Unless otherwise noted, the use of such ingredients for such purposes was prior to the present invention and forms no part of it, except in combinations specifically including the two specified dyes, the use of the two specified dyes together being considered the essential contribution of this invention. Also, the use of two dyes together in an ink formulation appears in various forms in the prior art, U.S. Patent No. 3,870,528, mentioned in the foregoing, being cited as the best convenient and tangible illustration as it is published and involves jet ink having absorbence at two frequencies, the same objectives to which this invention is directed.Federal Republic of Germany Patent 2,818,573, publishedFebruary 11, 1978, discloses ink jet printing inks in which the dye is Sulfur Black 1 alone. Some example formulas include N methyl 2 pyrrolidone, said to be a component of an anti foaming agent mixture, and sodium carbonate. Formulations closely similar to those disclosed herein employing only Direct Black 19 as the dye were known prior to the present invention. Although similar formulations employingDirect Black 163 were not necessarily known and successfully tested, it is acknowledged that the possibility of substitution of a new Direct Black dye, such as D.B. 163, for a previously used Direct Black dye, would be routinely considered by those in the field of development of improved inks for ink jet printers. Summary of the InventionThe object of the invention is therefore an infrared and visible dual dye ink comprising Sulfur Black 1 and a dye selected from the group consisting of Direct Black 163 and Direct Black 19. Included in the ink are materials the formation of agglomerations. Description of the InventionIn the following, reference to the Color Index refers to the well known, authoritative publication by that name published by the Society of Dyes and Colorists in cooperation with theAmerican Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists.Direct Black 163 is not found in the 19th edition, the most recent, but is found in Additions and Amendments, Number 15,April 1975 at page 523.Direct Black 163 is defined as a trisazo dye It is obtained from Sandoz, Inc.The structure of Direct Black 19 is disclosed in the ColorIndex. It is a highly resonant polyazo molecule with nitrogen and sulfonate substituents.The empirical formula of Sulfur Black 1 is discussed in theColor Index, along with the manufacturing process.These dyes are obtained from normal commercial sources. It will be understood, however, that the demanding characteristics of jet ink typically require more than routine commercial purity. The Direct Black 163 and Direct Black 19 dyes may be washed satisfactorily in moderately polar solvents, such as methanol. The preferred source, however, of the adequately pure dyes for this invention is by obtaining exceptionally purified dyes from the commercial supplier. The typical problem when purity is marginally less than adequate is one of agglomerations forming with or by action of the impurities.Direct Black 163 of adequately high purity is obtained fromSandoz, Inc. by purchase of that firm s Carta Black 2GT, 200 . The 200 designation refers to a ratio of dye to salts which has been found to indicate adequate purity for the purposes of this invention. Direct Black 19 sf adequately high purity is obtained fromSandoz, Inc. by purchase of that firm s Carta Black BI. TheBI is a designation which has become a specific identification to that firm of a dye manufactured to have a specific level of purity, which is of adequate purity for the purposes of this invention.Sulfur Black 1 of adequately high purity is obtained from theSodyeco Division of Martin Marietta Corporation by specifying the dye as manufactured to the highest level of purity available in amounts of any bulk from Sodyeco.Sodium Omadine is a brand named biocide of Olin Corporation.It is used to prevent the growth of microscopic organisms that could clog filters and printer mechanisms. Chemically, it is 90 sodium 2 pyridinethiol l oxide and 10 inert ingredients.Hampene 220 is a brand named sequestering agent of W. R. Grace and Company. It is used to sequester heavy metals in the ink which might otherwise form insoluble precipitates. Chemically, it is tetra sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate. Carbowax 200 is a brand named product of Union Carbide Corporation. It is used to prevent the formation of a hard crust on the nozzle tip as water evaporates during shutdown. Such a crust hinders stream start up. Chemically, it is polyethylene glycol of 200 average molecular weight. Many other similar materials known in this art can be substituted for theCarbowax 200.N methyl 2 pyrrolidone is the chemical name for a material used in these formulas as solvent for the dyes.The 2MB is a water fastness agent and has some anti crusting activity it is a polyamine having full substitution of the primary nitrogens. Specifically, , it is a 2 hydroxyethyl substituted polyethyleneimine having 7 or more nitrogen atoms per molecule. The material is a product of Cordova Chemical Company. Waterfastness is the characteristic of resistance of printing to wet rubbing and other water exposure.Butyl Cellosolve is a well known brand named product used as a paper penetrant. Chemically, it is ethylene glycol monobutyl ether. Many other similar materials known in this art can be substituted for the Butyl Cellosolve.Sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate function as buffers.

Glass containers are not used to avoid silicon contamination. The ink components are thoroughly mixed and the composition is then filtered to remove any particulate matter in the composition greater than 0.22 microns to ensure that the nozzle of the printer will remain unobstructed during printing.CharacteristicsThe inks of all of the examples have the desired satisfactory optical properties in both the visual and infrared ranges.Printing by the inks can be read by silicon photoconductors having peak responses in the 800 to 900 nm range without enhancement of contrast by special filters. If necessary and otherwise desirable, enhancement of contrast in the infrared range is achieved by increasing the amount of Sulfur Black in the ink formula. Both inks function and respond well during actual printing.The ink of Example I is preferred. It resists agglomeration when left in contact with a nozzle of commerical acetal resin, an environment which does occur in jet printers.It will be apparent that skilled jet ink chemists can modify the disclosed formulas greatly, particularly with respect to the non dye ingredients, while employing the basic contributions of the present invention, and that, accordingly, patent coverage should not be limited to the specific examples disclosed, but should be as provided by law, with particular reference to the following claims.
