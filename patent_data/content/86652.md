# Apparatus for biaxial blow moulding a hollow bottle shaped container of synthetic resin.

## Abstract
An apparatus for biaxial blow molding in a hollow bottle shaped container of a synthetic resin which has a bottom mold having an upper surface becoming the bottom mold surface of the bottle shaped container and a cylinder chamber formed therein, a bottom protruding pin having an upper end face form ing part of the bottom mold surface of the bottom mold and a piston portion formed at the bottom end thereof and tele scopically moved back and forth in the cylinder chamber of the bottom mold, and an elastic member disposed in the cylinder chamber of the bottom mold for urging the bottom protruding pin forwardly when the member is contacted with the piston portion of the bottom protruding pin in such a manner that the tension of the member is weaker than the pressure of com pressed air to be blown into the molds. This apparatus is oper ated by a method of biaxial blow molding the hollow bottle shaped container of a synthetic resin of the invention. Thus, the bottom of the blow molded piece of parison adhered to the bottom of the blowing mold at the time of blow molding can be readily released from upon opening of the split molds after the piece is completely blow molded.
