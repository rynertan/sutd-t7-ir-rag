## Description
The present invention relates to tissue degenerative inflammatory diseases, specifically periodontal disease and osteoarthritis, and to the prevention, treatment and amelioration thereof, employing a novel combination of natural substances for such purpose. Periodontal disease is an inflammatory disorder of the gums variously referred to as gum disease, periodontitis, and gingivitis. With the use of fluoride in drinking water and the daily use of toothpaste to help reduce tooth loss due to decay, gum disease has become the largest cause of tooth loss in the adult population of the United States, accounting for approximately 70 of such losses. The disorder results from the accumulation of plaque, particularly within the gum line, which, unless effectively removed, produces a chronic inflammatory process of the gingiva that spreads and destroys the connective tissues supporting the tooth as well as the tooth itself. Effective removal of plaque is difficult even with a vigorous and sustained program of brushing and flossing, and it has become clear that for effective control of periodontal disease, a more specific treating agent is needed. Another inflammatory disease which effects degeneration of connective tissues is osteoarthritis. Although the cause of osteoarthritis is obviously different from periodontal disease, the pathogenesis is much the same localized chronic inflammation with concomitant connective tissue degeneration. In periodontal disease, the body s response to the bacterial plaque results in an enzymatic attempt by the inflammatory cells to destroy the bacteria, and because this attack is non specific it also destroys adjacent normal tissues of the host, thereby forming periodontal pockets which provide a nitch for bacteria which are again attacked by inflammatory cells of the body to further erode the connective tissues surrounding the teeth. In osteoarthritis, the body s inflammatory response is localized in the joints. The body s inflammatory response is triggered by the presence of intracellular proteins released from the body s cells which have been injured or destroyed by wear and tear or by injury in athletes in skeletal joints. The body s inflammatory response leads to further erosion and tissue destruction, first wearing away connective tissues cartilage in the joint and then progressively the articular surfaces of the bones. Thus while periodontal disease and osteoarthritis are of radically different etiology, the pathogenesis of each parallels the other. And it is not unreasonable that compositions found effective to prevent or treat one of those tissue destructive inflammatory diseases would be found to have similar efficacy in treatment of the other. It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a composition for preventing and treating tissue destructive anti inflammatory diseases including periodontal disease and osteoarthritis. Another object is to provide a combination of natural substances useful for preventing and ameliorating the effects of such diseases. Other objects of the invention and its advantages over the prior art are apparent from the following description and claims. The present invention is grounded on applicant s discovery that the progression of tissue destructive inflammatory disease can be favorably affected by oral administration of a composition comprising a mild anti inflammatory agent and substances which accelerate fibrous connective tissue growth to replace connective tissue damaged by the disease. While the present composition is particularly directed at treatment of human disease it finds parallel application for veterinary use. The present composition comprises the daily oral administration of four substances a source of biologically available calcium ascorbic acid a precursor or stimulant of epinephrine or nor epinephrine production selected from tyrosine and phenylalanine and a mild anti inflammatory substance selected from the anti inflammatory members of the group consisting of simple sugars, amino sugars, amino acids, and derivatives thereof. The calcium source can be administered independent of the other substances administered in accordance with this process. The calcium source can be in the form of a dietary supplement or in the form of known dietary sources of biologically available calcium and should be administered in an amount sufficient to provide at least 10 milligrams of biologically available calcium per kilogram of body weight. In accordance with the invention, a powder base is provided having the following composition for the treatment of existing periodontal disease Bone meal, or the equivalent, serves as a source of calcium for tooth regeneration, as a general cleansing agent, and as a filler. Equivalent substances include the art recognized biologically compatible calcium salts, representative of which are calcium gluconate, calcium carbonate, tricalcium and dicalcium phosphate, dolomite and the like. The calcium component is not critical to the efficacy of the above composition where the afflicted individual undergoing treatment is receiving adequate biologically available calcium through other calcium sources either in the form of calcium containing dietary supplements or simply by having adequate dietary sources of calcium in the diet. Dietary sources of calcium include milk, cheese, collard greens, canned sardines, tofu made with calcium salt, cooked spinach, ice cream, cottage cheese, cooked soybeans, cooked frozen broccoli, cooked legumes, eggs, and bread or other products made with milk or milk solids. An average adult requires between about 500 and 1500 milligrams day of biologically available calcium. This can be translated into a calcium intake requirement of at least 10 milligrams of biologically available calcium per kilogram of body weight. Generally a person or animal undergoing treatment with the present composition should have a daily calcium intake, either by dietary supplement or by normal dietary consumption of calcium containing foods, of between about 10 and about 25, more preferably between about 15 and about 20 milligrams of, biologically available calcium per kilogram of body weight. Glucosamine, preferably used in the form of the salt with hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, or other biocompatible acid, is known to have an anti inflammatory effect when taken orally. Tapadinhas et al., Ascorbic acid is the only ingredient in the above formulation which is disclosed in the scientific literature as having been used in the treatment of periodontal disease. A study reported in 1964 showed that oral ingestion of ascorbic acid, combined with scaling of calculus from the periodontal disease sites, gave a greater increase in tooth stability than either treatment alone, bath of which showed a small beneficial effect. El Ashiry et al., As a precursor of epinephrine, tyrosine is a preferred substance for use in the present invention, because it has been shown in tissue culture to promote proliferation of the type of cell fibroblasts which are involved in the healing of periodontal tissue. Litvin, The composition described above is effective for the treatment and alleviation of periodontal disease. For preventing the disease or, after treatment has relieved the inflammatory condition which characterizes the disease, the composition is suitably modified by replacing the glucosamine or other anti inflammatory sugar or amino sugar with an amino acid having an anti inflammatory effect. For this purpose, cysteine is preferred because it is bactericidal against Further in accordance with the present invention a composition useful for the treatment of tissue degenerative inflammatory disease in animals afflicted with such disease or disposed to development of such disease comprises, in parts per weight ascorbic acid, 1 to 5 parts a precursor or stimulant of epinephrine or nor epinephrine production selected from tyrosine or phenylalanine, 0.5 to 2.5 parts and an anti inflammatory substance, 1 to 5 parts, said anti inflammatory substance being selected from the amino sugars, glucosamine, D mannosamine, D galactosamine, their biocompatible acid addition salts, glucosamine 6 phosphate, N acetyl D glucosamine, N acetyl D galactosamine, UDP N acetylglucosamine the sugars 2 deoxy D glucose, 2 deoxy D galactose and mannose and the amino acids cysteine, creatine, creatinine, L tryptophan, valine, alanine, glycine, glutamine, aspartic acid and S methylcysteine. Where the composition is to be administered for the treatment of tissue degenerative inflammatory disease in animals whose normal dietary intake of calcium containing food is not sufficient to provide an average of at least 10 milligrams of biologically available calcium for every kilogram of animal body weight, said composition should include, in addition, a calcium source providing 2 to 10 parts by weight biologically available calcium. For treatment of periodontal disease the present composition can include optional ingredients, such as fluoride ion sources, sudsing agents, flavoring agents, sweetening agents, anti calculus agents, anti plaque agents, coloring agents and opacifying agents, as described in Denny US A 4 254 101. When prepared in the form of a powder useful for treatment of periodontal disease, the present composition can be used by applying it with a soft toothbrush into the gingival tooth junction twice per day, followed, if desired, by rinsing. It can also be used in the form of a paste or gel, in which the total concentration of the composition can be as low as about 5 by weight. For use in treating periodontal disease, the powder form is advantageously used, without dilution. The preventative formulation, for example with cysteine in place of glucosamine, can be used as a matrix, blown in with a periojet at the time of surgery to promote healing and also to provide a better attachment for tissue. The composition for treatment of periodontal disease in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention can be formulated as a toothpaste or a gel by milling in a conventional manner with an appropriate amount of glycerol, sorbital, and water, plus a thickening agent for example, xanthan gum to produce the desired consistency, plus an opacifying agent if the toothpaste form is desired. These formulations are used in a conventional manner with care to work the material into the gingival tooth junction. In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, osteoarthritis, a tissue destructive inflammatory disease characterized by a chronic inflammation of the connective tissue surrounding skeletal joints, is treated to reduce or prevent the tissue degenerative effects of the inflammatory disease and to promote connective tissue regrowth. This is accomplished in accordance with the present invention by the oral administration of the following substances to an animal or person afflicted with such disease or disposed to the development of such disease, in the relative mass proportions indicated ascorbic acid, 1 to 5 parts biologically available calcium, 2 to 10 parts a precursor or stimulant of epinephrine or nor epinephrine selected from tyrosine and phenylalanine, 0.5 to 2.5 parts and an anti inflammatory substance, 1 to 5 parts, said anti inflammatory substance being selected from the above recited amino sugars, amino sugar derivatives and acid addition salts thereof, sugars, sugar derivatives and amino acids. The biologically available calcium component can, as in the case of the above described method for treatment of periodontal disease, be supplied through normal dietary consumption of foods containing biologically available calcium or by consumption of calcium containing dietary supplements. The present composition can be administered in combination as a single composition including the substances with or without calcium depending on the person s or animal s existing diet in the relative mass proportions indicated. The composition can be formulated into a pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form for oral ingestion for example, powder, tablet or capsules using art recognized drug formulation techniques. Such dosage forms can contain from 250 milligrams to 1,000 milligrams of the present composition. Alternatively each of the substances comprising the present composition can be formulated individually into dosage forms suitable for oral administration and said individual dosage forms administered in combination in amounts effective to reduce or prevent the tissue degenerative effects of the inflammatory disease and to promote connective tissue regrowth. Thus treatment of osteoarthritis in a person or animal afflicted with such disease or disposed to the development of such disease can be accomplished in accordance with the present method comprising daily oral administration of 300 to 2,000 milligrams of ascorbic acid, a calcium source providing from 500 to 1,500 milligrams of biologically available calcium from 250 milligrams to 1,000 milligrams of tyrosine or phenylalanine and from 300 milligrams to 2,000 milligrams of a mild anti inflammatory substance as defined hereinabove. Alternatively, preferred dosage levels on a mg Kg of body weight basis are ascorbic acid, 5 to 25 mg Kg, more preferably 10 to 20 mg Kg biologically available calcium, 10 to 40 mg Kg, more preferably 15 to 30 mg Kg tyrosine or phenylalanine, 3 to 15 mg Kg, more preferably 5 to 10 mg Kg and an anti inflammatory substance as disclosed hereinabove, 5 to 25 mg Kg, more preferably 10 to 20 mg Kg. The preferred daily dose for any particular animal or person afflicted with osteoarthritis would depend on the degree to which the disease has progressed at the time treatment is initiated. Thus for preventative purposes in individuals who have perhaps had past occurrences of the disease or, for example, in the case of athletes who subject their joints to continual stress and strain thereby initiating a potentially progressive inflammatory situation, dosages at the lower end of the above cited dosage ranges are appropriate. In cases of advanced osteoarthritis, on the other hand, dosages in the mid to upper portions of the above described dosage ranges would be appropriate. Moreover, in cases of advanced osteoarthritis the present composition and method is advisably used in combination with an art recognized non steroidal analgesic anti inflammatory agent such as aspirin, ibuprofen, fenoprofen calcium, tolmetin sodium, indomethacin, piroxicam, naproxen and sulindac. The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples, none of which are to be construed as limiting the invention in any respect. Examples 1 3 below exemplify compositions in accordance with the present invention. Examples 4 and 5 illustrate formulations of the composition of Example 1 for use in treatment of periodontal disease. The following example reports the results of a clinical study of a composition of the present invention in the treatment of advanced periodontal disease. The patients in this study had all been referred for periodontal surgery because of advanced disease. Selection for the study was conditioned on two factors 1 no immediate necessity for the surgery and 2 willingness to learn to use the required brushing technique, as described in the publication The Realistic Way to Dental Wellness, by John H. Duffy, D.D.S., Realistic Hygiene, Inc., 2354 Highway AB, McFarland, Wisconsin 53558, U.S.A. 1978 . Parallel groups of controls and test patients were selected on the basis of being as clinically similar as possible. As exceptions, two patients were chosen who had earlier refused to have surgery and had been dry brushing without dentifrice or any other material added to the mouth with proper technique under periodontal supervision for eighteen months and two years, respectively, without much impact on their disease. These two patients were chosen as test patients to study the beneficial effects of brushing alone as compared with short term use of the powder of the present invention. Both control and test patients practiced dry brushing for a minimum of three weeks to assure that they were using the proper brushing techniques, acceptable to the periodontist conducting the study. After the initial period, in which brushing techniques were evaluated and mistakes corrected, the controls were instructed to continue brushing twice a day, while the test patients were told to brush twice daily using a powder having the following composition Progress was measured by using a University of Wisconsin periodontal probe to measure any difference in pocket depth from the beginning of the study until its conclusion. The pocket is the space between gum and tooth in periodontal disease which does not exist in healthy gums, providing a site for bacterial infection and inflammation which destroys the surrounding gum and osseous support for the tooth, and eventually causes the tooth itself to be lost. Pocket depth measurements were made on four sides of each tooth. All four readings for each tooth were then added together for all of the teeth of a given patient, and the result was divided by the total number of the patient s teeth varying from patient to patient to give an average score per tooth for the sum of the pocket depths on the four sides. A decrease in average pocket depth thus would represent an improvement in the patient s condition and a positive response to the treatment being employed. Because brushing is a one handed operation, usually done with the same hand by a given patient, the brushing tends to be more effective on the side opposite the brushing hand, with the result that periodontal disease tends to be less advanced on that side. For the same reason, the treatment carried out in the present invention also tends to by unsymmetrical. Because of this effect, data were accumulated separately for the left and right sides of the patients mouths in order to rule out any resulting bias in the results. As the accompanying tables show, there is no consistent relationship between the effects of proper brushing alone and time of brushing, with some patients showing considerable improvement while others showed deterioration. Indeed, in the control group there was not even a good correlation in the results on each side of the mouth, except that the left side averaged a greater improvement, as would be expected since the subjects were right handed. On the other hand, in the test group no patient got worse, and the average decrease in pocket depth was approximately tenfold that seen with brushing alone. In addition, slightly greater improvement was seen on the right side, suggesting that the powder had compensated for the effects of unequal brushing. During the course of this trial, all patients were evaluated at frequent intervals every three weeks or so to make sure that their conditions did not worsen, which would have made immediate surgery necessary. One patient MS C had already had surgery on the right side of her mouth and wished to delay the surgery on the left side. She was put on the powder after only one month of brushing with the powder, she improved so dramatically that surgery on the left side may no longer be necessary. MS A was the first patient in the study, and several different proportions of ingredients in the powder were tested on him until an optimum formulation was found, as judged by a maximum suppression of inflammation. This was the formulation thereafter used on MS A and adopted for all of the other patients in the study. The time shown below in Tables 3 and 4 for MS A s use of the powder are for his use of the optimum formulation, and, to simplify comparisons, all improvements achieved prior to MS A s use of the final formulation are ascribed inaccurately to brushing alone i.e., dry brushing. Thus, for MS A , the improvement attributed to four months of brushing alone actually included two months of brushing with powder having varying proportions of ingredients. To avoid this inaccuracy, the results of the study are also reported at the bottom of Tables 3 and 4 without the data from MS A . This more critical treatment of the data demonstrates even more impressively the effect of the powder on periodontal disease. Although the only parameter which could be objectively quantified here was pocket depth, it was noted that the degree of grossly observable inflammation decreased in parallel with the degree of decrease in pocket depth. In summary, the results of this clinical trial show that the powder formulation employed is effective in the treatment of periodontal disease, either to decrease inflammation prior to surgery or, in some cases, to even replace surgery. The following Examples 7 11 illustrate application of the present method to the treatment of osteoarthritis. An Old English Sheepdog was born with congenital hip dysplasia which improved upon splinting , developed severe secondary degenerative osteoarthritis when she was five years old, resulting in significant apparent pain on walking and an inability to run or jump. An x ray of her pelvis revealed severe joint degeneration and advanced osteoarthritis. She was started on one aspirin per day, which appeared to offer some relief from pain but the dog s movements were still very limited. By the time the dog was seven years old she was severely lame. The dog was started on a daily dose of 250 mg tyrosine, 100 mg vitamin C, and 500 mg glucosamine. No calcium supplement was used since the dog received a bone meal supplement in her diet. After six months on that treatment the dog was able to move without pain. After three years on the medication she was completely ambulatory, with her only limitation being lateral movement of her rear legs. There was some apparent stiffness consistent with connective tissue growth supporting the femur in the greatest weight bearing area. An x ray of the animal taken after three years showed that while there was little change in bony degradation, therefore indicating that the reversal of symptomology was due to the ingrowth of dense connective tissue growth in and around the afflicted joints. During the second year the vitamin C tyrosine glucosamine supplement was withheld for several days to see if it was necessary to be taken on a daily basis. After two days the dog began showing pain requiring that the supplement be immediately reinstituted. Also, because of the advanced stage of her disease, the single aspirin a day was continued throughout treatment with the supplement. A 66 year old woman with osteoarthritis of the cervical spine, secondary to osteoporosis had been experiencing severe pain for almost a year. She was treated in accordance with the present composition by daily oral administration of the following substances 500 mg tyrosine, 1000 mg vitamin C, 1000 mg glucosamine, and 1500 mg calcium carbonate. After six months on this regimen which also included 3 600 mg Nalfon A 73 year old man with diagnosed osteoarthritis of the spine and right hip had been taking non steroidal anti inflammatory medications for two years first Motrin, then Naproxyn, then Feldene . However, his condition deteriorated so much and his pain so great that he was unable to leave his apartment. He began taking daily in combination 500 mg tyrosine, 1000 mg glucosamine, and 1000 mg vitamin C. He maintained a high calcium diet. After taking the composition for a year together with a standard non steroidal anti inflammatory medication Nalfon, 1200 mg day he became completely symptom free, and remained symptom free for a period of six months following the time he stopped taking the substances in accordance with this method. Upon reoccurrence of his discomfort he resumed treatment in accordance with the present method and after three weeks was once again symptom free. A 53 year old woman was diagnosed as having osteoarthritis of the right hip and given standard non steroidal anti inflammatory therapy Nalfon, 300 mg, 4 times per day . Although she initially experienced subjective improvement, some six months later her condition deteriorated to the extent that 600 mg Nalfon, four times daily, was required for function, but she was still in considerable pain and unable to walk without a severe limp. Nine months after the original diagnosis, x rays of her pelvis revealed complete destruction of the cartilage in her hip so that bone was rubbing on bone this was responsible for her severe symptomology. She was told that the only relief for her advanced disease was total hip replacement. While contemplating surgery, she began to take the present composition in the highest daily dose which applicant would recommend in accordance with the present composition 1000 mg tyrosine, 2000 mg vitamin C, 2000 mg glucosamine and 1500 mg calcium carbonate in addition to a high calcium diet . After three days on this composition she began to experience slight pain relief, after one month considerable pain relief and significantly increased mobility, and after two months pain was diminishing to the point where she began to lower her Nalfon dose. She now walks without a limp, but after five months, still requires treatment in accordance with the present composition in addition to 3 600 mg Nalfon daily.
