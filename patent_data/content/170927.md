# Detergent compositions.

## Abstract
A shampoo composition in gel form contains a detergent, from 0.1 to 5 by weight of hydroxy propyl guar gum or hy droxy ethyl cellulose, and an antidandruff agent. The guar gum or hydroxy ethyl cellulose helps to stabilise the viscosity of the composition.

## Description
DETERGENT COMPOSITIONSThe present invention relates to detergent compositions and in particular to gel shampoo compositions.Gel shampoo compositions are known in the cosmetic art to be compositions which have an aesthetically pleasing appearance and consistency. They may be dispensed from a range of devices including bottles, pump packs, tubs or tubes, and are particularly suitable for dispensing from tubes.Our published UK Patent Application No.2107586 discloses a gel shampoo composition having two contiguous gel bodies, one containing detergent, the other containing an insoluble anti dandruff agent, zinc pyridinethione herein referred to asZPT . The high viscosity of the gel body enables the insoluble anti dandruff agent to be suspended therein without the need for a suspending agent.A disadvantage of gel compositions is that they tend to show large variations in viscosity during manufacture. The observed variations are known to be caused by small variations in the concentrations of inorganic ions in the composition and hence variations in the concentrations of those constituents which are sources of such ions. A major source of inorganic ions in shampoo compositions is the detergent, which is usually an anionic detergent. The concentrations of ions tend to vary from batch to batch of detergent making it difficult to control these concentrations during manufacture. It would be most advantageous therefore if a less sensitive rigid gel composition could be identified.It has now suprisingly been found that the incorporation of certain humectant polymers into the gel composition provides a composition with a viscosity which is much less sensitive to variations in the levels of constituent inorganic ions.The term humectant polymer1 is used herein to mean a polymer having an affinity for water and the ability to regulate the free water content of the medium in which it is incorporated. According to the present invention there is provided a shampoo composition in gel form comprising a detergent, from 0.1 to 5 by weight of a stabilising humectant polymer selected from non ionic guar gums, hydroxy C1 6 alkyl ethers and hydroxy C16 alkyl esters of cellulose, and a cosmetically acceptable excipient.The composition of the invention may also contain an anti dandruff agent.Preferred humectant polymers include hydroxy propyl guar gum and hydroxy ethyl cellulose.A particularly preferred form of hydroxy propyl guar gum is that marketed under the Trade Name ofJaguar HP 60, and a preferred form of hydroxy ethyl cellulose is that marketed under the Trade name ofNatrosol 250 HHR.The composition of the invention preferably contains about 0.58 w w of the humectant polymer.The anti dandruff agent may be soluble or insoluble in the composition of the invention although preferred anti dandruff agents are insoluble. A particularly preferred anti dandruff agent is ZPT, and this is suitably present in the composition in an amount of 0.18 to 2.5 by weight of the total composition.Suitably the composition is contained in a bottle, pump pack, tub or tube, preferably in a collapsible tube.In one preferred aspect, the composition of the invention comprises a first gel body containing the detergent and the humectant polymer and a second gel body contiguous with the first gel body, containing the anti dandruff agent and, optionally, the same humectant polymer.Suitably the first gel body is transparent or translucent and the second gel body is substantially opaque.In the aforementioned preferred aspect of the invention the composition is suitably contained in a tube or other container which is preferably collapsible, so that when the composition is discharged from the container the two gel bodies remain in contact with each other and form a self supporting gel structure. The consistencies of the two gel bodies should be sufficiently firm to hold the bodies together in position, and yet be easily extrudable through, for example, the nozzle of a tube. Preferably, the two gel bodies have substantially identical rheological properties.The weight ratios of the two bodies can vary within wide limits. For example, the weight ratio of the first gel body to the second gel body may be from about 1 9 to 9 1. A particularly suitable ratio is 1 1. The distribution of the two gel bodies can also vary widely in order to give different visual patterns. For example, one gel body may be completely contained within the other gel body, or one gel may be partly contained in the other gel body to form a stripe or stripes.The desired rheological properties of the gel bodies may be achieved by incorporating suitable thickening materials into the bodies. For example, the bodies may be thickened with a gum or thickening agent of either natural, or synthetic origin. Suitable thickening agents are, for example, proteins, silicas, alginates, sodium magnesium silicates, acrylic acid co polymers and maleic anhydride co polymers.It has been found desirable to use as a thickening agent a material which has secondary detergent and or foam stabilising properties. One or more such foam stabiliser thickener materials may be present in each gel body, and preferred materials are lauric isopropanolamide and coconut monoethanolamide. The amount of such a foam stabiliser thickener is preferably from 0.5 to 7.0 by weight of the total composition.Preferably each gel body contains one or more agents designed to improve the cosmetic condition of the hair after shampooing, by enhancing feel and gloss and reducing electrostatic flyaway. Such agents may comprise wholly or in part the detergent materials described above as providing a foam stabilising or thickening effect, or may comprise other agents with surface active properties or certain polymeric materials. Suitable surface active materials are certain salts of ethoxylated fatty alcohol phosphate esters, particularly an oleyl alcohol derived material marketed under the trade name Briphos 03D. Suitable polymeric materials are cat ironic cellulosic resins marketed under the trade name Polymer JR 125,400 or 30M or quaternary of a vinyl pyrolidone copolymer marketed under the trade name Gafquat. 755N. A particularly effective material is a cationic guar gum sold under the trade name Jaguar C 13 S byMeyhall Chemicals Ltd. This may be present in either or both gel bodies in an amount from 0.1 to 5.0 by weight of the total composition.The compositions according to the invention may include any conventional detergent well known in the art. For shampoo compositions, it is usual to use an anionic detergent, for example alkali metal, ammonium or hydroxyalkylamine salts of alkyl sulphate or alkyl ether sulphates, alkyl benzene sulphonates, alkyl sulphones,oC alkenyl sulphonates, polyoxyethylenealkyl sulphonates and polyoxyethylenalkylphenylsulphates.However, non ionic and amphoteric detergents may also be used. A preferred detergent comprises sodium lauryl ether sulphate. The shampoo composition of the invention preferably contains from 5 to 25 w w of detergent based upon 100 active material .The composition of the invention may also contain various conventional accessory ingredients such as perfumes, colouring materials and preservatives.The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a detergent composition, which comprises a. admixing the humectant polymer and the detergent in water, suitably at an elevated temperature preferably 70 to 75 C b. and optionally adding the anti dandruff agent.Additional ingredients such as thickening agents, foam stabilisers, conditioning agents, opacifying agents, dyes, perfumes and preservatives may be added at any convenient time during the process.Suitably the dyes, perfumes and preservatives are added after the addition of the anti dandruff agent preferably at ambient or slightly above ambient temperature. In a further aspect the present invention also provides a process for the preparation of the aforementioned preferred form of the composition, wherein the first gel body is prepared according to step a and may optionally include additional water the second gel body is prepared according to steps a and b .In the preferred form of the present invention the compositions may be made by charging a suitable container with the two gel bodies, using the method and apparatus described in British PatentSpecification No. 962,757.The present invention will now be illustrated by the following Examples.
