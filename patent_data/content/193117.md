## Description
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, and more particularly, to a method of manufacturing an MOS type transistor. Recently, an MOS type transistor using a p pocket structure to prevent the microdevice punch through effect without increasing the impurity concentration in a channel region has been proposed. A method of manufacturing an MOS transistor having such a structure will be explained below with reference to Figs. 1A and 1B. Element isolation region 2 is formed on the surface of p type semiconductor substrate 1. Gate electrode 4, of polycrystalline silicon, is then formed on substrate 1 through gate oxide film 3. Shallow n type regions 5a and 5b are formed by ion implanting arsenic in substrate 1, using gate electrode 4 as a mask. Boron is then ion implanted in substrate 1 at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV and a dose of 3 10¹² cm² to form p type regions 6a and 6b Fig. 1A . CVD SiO₂ layer 7 is deposited over the entire surface of the resultant structure. Layer 7 is then removed using reactive ion etching RIE so that it remains on only the side walls of gate electrode 4 and gate oxide film 3. N type regions 8a and 8b are then formed by ion implanting phosphorus in substrate 1, using remaining SiO₂ layer 7 and gate electrode 4 as masks. Source region 9 consists of regions 5a and 8a, and drain region 10 consists of regions 5b and 8b. P type regions, so called p pocket regions 11a and 11b, are then formed beneath regions 5a and 5b. Protective film 12 is formed over the entire resultant structure. Contact holes 13 are then formed by selectively removing portions of protective film 12 corresponding to regions 8a and 8b. Finally, Aℓ electrodes 14 are formed in contact holes 13, thus forming an MOS transistor having an LDD lightly doped drain structure Fig. 1B . With the conventional manufacturing method described above, however, when ion implantation is performed using gate electrode 4 as a mask, ions not only reach the prospective formation areas for the source and drain regions, but also penetrate through gate electrode 4 and gate insulating film 3 into the underlying substrate. This results in the so called channeling phenomenon, which causes the problem of variations in the threshold voltage of the transistor. When a p pocket region is formed by ion implanting, at a high acceleration voltage, boron which has a small atomic radius, the channeling phenomenon is particularly notable. It is possible to prevent this ion penetration by increasing the film thickness of gate electrode 4. In this case, however, taking into account the formation of uniformly patterned gate electrode 4 and element evenness, it is not possible to increase the thickness of electrode 4 beyond a certain limit, the ceiling of which is 400 to 600 nm 4,000 to 6,000 Å . As a result, variations in threshold voltage cannot be eliminated. The article in the Journal of the Electromechanical Society, Vol. 127, pages 206 210 1980 describes arsenic ion channeling through single crystal silicon. Polycrystalline silicon gates are reported to form large grains during heavy implantation which have reduced stopping power. The formation of a surface amorphous layer is considered not sufficient to prevent channeling. The article in Transactions of the Metallurgical Society of AIME, Vol.245, pages 469 473 1969 describes experiments which produce high crystallographic disorder in single crystal silicon by heavy implantation to reduce channelling to an insignificant minimum. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device which prevents the penetration of ions through an ion implantation mask during ion implantation. According to the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, comprising the steps of forming an insulating film on forming an insulating film on a semiconductor substrate forming a polycrystalline silicon layer on said insulating film performing ion implantation in said polycrystalline silicon layer to convert all of said polycrystalline silicon layer or a predetermined thickness of said polycrystalline silicon layer into an amorphous silicon layer patterning said polycrystalline silicon layer, either all of which or a predetermined thickness of which, has been converted into an amorphous silicon layer and ion implanting an impurity in said semiconductor substrate using said patterned layer as a mask. According to the method of the present invention, a polycrystalline silicon layer is converted into an amorphous silicon layer by ion implanting an impurity in the polycrystalline silicon layer. For use as the impurity, an atom which has a large atomic radius and which can therefore easily convert polycrystalline silicon to amorphous silicon is preferable. An n type impurity is preferable, because with p type ions, the resistance of amorphous silicon increases undesirably. Preferable atoms are silicon, fluorine, phosphorus, arsenic, and argon atoms. The acceleration voltage and ion dose for ion implantation need only be sufficient to convert at least a portion of the polycrstalline silicon layer, whose thickness is predetermined, to an amorphous silicon layer. The method of the present invention can be applied not only to the manufacture of a MOS transistor, but also to the formation of an electrode of a capacitor formed together on a single substrate with a device requiring ion implantation. Impurity penetration can, in this application, be prevented in the same manner as described above. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which An embodiment of the present invention, applied to the manufacture of an n channel MOS transistor having an LDD p pocket structure, will be described below with reference to Figs. 2A to 2F. Element isolation region 22 was first formed on the surface of p type 100 silicon substrate 21 outside the element region thereof by selective oxidation Fig. 2A . Oxide film 23 having a thickness 25nm of 250 Å was then formed on the entire surface of substrate 21 in an oxygen atmosphere. Undoped , 400 nm 4,000 Å thick polysilicon layer 24 was formed. Phosphorus was then diffused into layer 24 using the POCℓ₃ diffusion method Fig. 2B , and silicon was ion implanted into the entire surface of layer 24 at an acceleration voltage of 180 kV and a dose of 2 10¹⁵ cm². As a result, the region from the surface of layer 24 to a depth of 250 nm 2,500 Å thereof was converted to amorphous silicon layer 25 Fig. 2C . Layer 25, layer 24, and oxide film 23 were then properly etched using photolithography, RIE, or a similar method, and gate electrode 26 and gate oxide film 27 were formed. Boron doped layers 28a and 28b were formed by ion implanting boron for p pocket formation in substrate 21 at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV and a dose of 3 10¹² cm². Phosphorus doped layers 29a and 29b were then formed by ion implanting phosphorus for n type region formation at an acceleration voltage of 35 kV and a dose of 2 10¹³ cm². Next, CVD SiO₂ film 30 was deposited to a thickness of 300 nm 3,000 Å over the entire surface of the resultant structure. Etching was performed using an RIE technique, so that portions of SiO₂ film 30 were left on only the side walls of gate electrode 26 and gate oxide film 27. Arsenic doped layers 31a and 31b were then formed by ion implanting arsenic for the formation of an n type region at an acceleration voltage of 40 kV and a dose of 5 10¹⁵ cm², using film 30 and electrode 26 as a mask Fig. 2E . PSG phosphosilicate glass film 32 was deposited to a thickness of 500 nm 5,000 Å over the entire surface of the structure as a protective film. Annealing was then performed in a nitrogen atmosphere at a temperature of 900 C for 20 minutes in order to electrically activate the ion implanted impurities. This resulted in the formation of source region 35, consisting of regions 33a and region 34a drain region 36, consisting of regions 33b and 34b, and p pockets 37a and 37b. At the same time, the upper portion of the amorphous silicon layer of gate electrode 26 was converted into a polycrystalline silicon layer. The surface resistance of gate electrode 26 did not increase. Contact holes 38 were then formed by selectively removing portions of PSG film 32 corresponding to regions 34a and 34b. Aluminum was deposited to a thickness of about 1.0 µm over the entire surface, and patterned to obtain Aℓ electrode 39, resulting in an n channel MOS transistor having an LDD p pocket structure Fig. 2F . According to the above embodiment, undoped polycrystalline silicon layer 24 was formed on silicon substrate 21 through oxide film 23. Phosphorus was then diffused in silicon layer 24 using a POCℓ₃ technique, and amorphous silicon layer 25 was formed by ion implanting silicon in the upper portion of layer 24. As a result, the penetration of boron ions through gate electrode 26 and gate oxide film 27 into substrate 21 during the ion implantation of boron for p pocket formation can be prevented. In other words, the boron ions are stopped at the polycrystalline silicon layer or the amorphous silicon layer of gate electrode 26, thus preventing the channeling phenomenon and guaranteeing a constant threshold voltage. In the embodiment described above, phosphorus was used as an impurity to convert a polycrystalline silicon layer into an n conductivity type layer, but boron or the like can also be used to convert the layer into a p conductivity type layer. In the embodiment described above, only the upper portion of the polycrystalline layer was converted into an amorphous silicon layer, but it is also possible to convert the entire polycrystalline layer into an amorphous silicon layer. In the embodiment described above, the present invention was applied to the manufacture of an n channel MOS transistor having an LDD p pocket structure. The present invention, however, is not limited to this. It is equally effective in the prevention of ion penetration through the gate electrode and the like during ion implantation of boron for forming p channel source and drain regions in a CMOS IC, in which n and p channel transistors are formed together on the same substrate.
