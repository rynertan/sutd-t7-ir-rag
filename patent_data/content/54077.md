# Method of transmitting information between stations attached to a unidirectional transmission ring.

## Abstract
In a ring communication system comprising several stations, access to the ring is granted to one station at a time by a circulating token indication. A method is provided guaranteeing a transmission opportunity for synchronous or circuit switched data in periodic time intervals to authorized stations. A CS monitor station issues a frame header which is marked in a specific bit position to allow only authorized stations to transmit their synchronous data together with a destination address. In a first embodiment, a single frame comprises a plurality of slots each having a free busy indication, a destination address field and a field for synchronous data, and each authorized station can occupy one such slot. In a second embodiment, a marked frame can be used by only one authorized station for transmitting synchronous data, but a new marked frame header is reissued until all authorized stations around the ring have transmitted synchronous data.
