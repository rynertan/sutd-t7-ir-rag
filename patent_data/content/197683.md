# Package forming apparatus, method and carton.

## Abstract
This relates to providing internal compression in pack ages of the type utilizing a wrap around carton. Instead of the utilizing locking cut outs provided for receiving articles to be packaged, special compression cuts are formed in the closure panels of a wrap around carton so that the compress ion cuts are independent of the locking cut outs thereby permitting one chain and lug arrangement to be utilized in conjunction with numerous types of packages. The lugs 82 are carried by compression chains 78, 80 located in a plane below the support plane of the articles to be packaged with the lugs being pivotally mounted on pins and normally having downwardly sloping positions for engaging in the compression cuts when the closure flaps are in their generally vertical depending position. The lugs are swing able upwardly to generally horizontal positions with the closure panels. Each lug carries a finger having a nose particularly configurated for automatically entering and centering within a compression cut.
