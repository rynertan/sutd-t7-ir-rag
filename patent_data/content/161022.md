## Description
CESCRIPTION This invention relates to a device for ectiveting the manual control in en electrically controlled window regulator. any types of electrical window regulator devices for motor cars are being provided at the present time, which are intended to be installed both as a first installation and as an accessory. In both cases there arises the problem of providing the device with a manual control adapted to operate as an alternative of the electric control when this latter fails or is cocked. Usually the alternative manual controls are formed by a clutch member actuated by a crank which disconnects the electric control, thus allowing a person to translate the glass by operating the crank. These devices are not easy to be used inasmuch as they require a considerable continuous stress onto the crank with the consequent uncomfortableness for the person who has to operate the crank. It S an cbject of the present invention to provide a device for reactivating the manual control as an alternative of the electric control, which will be of simple construction and easy to operate without requiring high stresses from the user and at the same time will be extremely reliable for any necessity of use. To attain these and further objects which will be more clearly apparent from the folllowing description the invention proposes to provide a device for activating the manual control in an electrically controlled window regulator of the type in which the window glass translation electric control is actuated by a motor operated manually in a suitable manner, which controls the translation of the glass by means of kinematic mechanisms comprising a worm screw gear assembly and in which the worm screw is rotated by the motor through a flexible control and the gear puts into axial rotation a member which produces the vertical translational movement of the glass, characterized in that between the gear and the said member there are interposed a sleeve and a bushing, rigidly connected to one another to rotate together, the said bushing being in constant rigid connection with said member the sleeve being pushed ty resilient means intc rlid rotational engagement with the gear manually controlled crank mecslen sms bEing provided for disengaging the sleeve from the gear against the action of said resilient means in order to transmit the rotational movement directly to the said member through said crank mechanism with the interposition of the sleeve. The invention will now be described with reference to the annexed drawings, in which Figure 1 is a partially sectional front view of the device, Figure 2 is a cross sectional view along line Il Il of Fig. 1, showing the two operative conditions of the electric and the manual controls of the window regulator device, and Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the crank used for actuating the manual control. The electrically controlled window regulator is generally and conven tionally formed by a body 10,mounted within the door of the vehicle,in which a worm screw 11 is rotationslly mounted this latter is rotated by an electric motor not shown through a suitable flsxible control 12. Engaged with the screw 11 is a gear 13 rotationally mounted on a sleeve 14, The gear 13 and the sleeve 14 are provided with axial and radial toothings 1c and 16, respectively, far o mutual engagement in order to render them rigidly connected to one another during the electricelly controlled cperatlor cf the window regulator. The sleeve 14, in its turn, is rotatably connected in a rigid manner to a bushing 17 by means of splined coupling 18. Th,e sleeve 17, still by means of a splined coupling 19, will in its turr be rigidly connected for rotate to a pivot not shown which through known kinematic mechanisrr.s produces the vertical translation of the glass of the window. The body 10 is mounted in a recess of the inner panel 2e of the door, with the interposition of a disc 21, on a circumferential relief 22 of which the said body is applied in a snapping fashion. Also formed in the disc21 is e circumferential groove 23 for the insertion, still in e snapping fashion, cf a concealing plaque 24 for concealing the described assembly frcm the ins de of the vehicle.The operation of the electric control is as follows By cperating the special pushbutton disposed in the position of easier acces for the user, the motor puts into rotation the screw 11 and, consequently, the sleeve 14 and the bushing 17, this latter producing the up and down movement of the window glass. The continuous meshing of the gear 13 with the sleeve 14 during the operation of the device or even during the rest stage of this latter is ensured by a spring 25 inserted between reliefs of the two members which pushes axially the sleeve 14 so as to make it abut against the gear 13 with constant meshing of the respective teeth 15 and 16.In case of a failure of the electrically controlled device, provision is made for removing the plaque 24 from the disc 23 and inserting, into the opening thus formed, e crenk assembly formed by ring 26 into which there is inserted a lever 27 rotatably retained by e Seger cone 28. The user. in order to actuate the mechanical control, will carry out the combination of twe movements. The first movement is a pressure onto the crank assembly which. as can be seen in the upper half of the Fig. 2, gives rise to thE translation cf the sleeve 14 against the action of the spring 2 until producing the 4sengagement of the teeth 15 and 16 and, hence, the disengagement of the sleeve 14 from the gear 13.The second movement is the rotation of the lever 27 which, as can be seen in Fig. 2, inserts with its central portion into the coupling 1e of the sleeve 14, thus rendering rigidly connected to rotate with one another the sleeve 14 and the lever 27. Sr.e the sleeve 14, in its turn. continues to be rigidly connected to rotate together with the bushing 19, the rotational movement is transmitted directly from the lever 27 to the bushing 19 and from this latter to the kinematic translation mechanism of the glass. tbe electric control being thusdisinserted owing to the disengagement of the sleeve 14 from the gear 13, as pointed out before. After having reactivated the electric control it is sufficient to extract the assembly 26 27, shown in Fig. 3, from the recess cf sleeve 14 and close the said recess by applying thereon a mask meter 24. The spring 25, which is no more compressed, will again push the sleeve 14 in order to engage the teeth 15 and 16 with one another, thus rendering connected for rotation the bushing 17, the slieve 14 and the gear 13 and, eccordingly, restoring the tronsmissoe of the movement to the glass by means cf the electric control.
