# Process for the preparation of an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a process for the pre paration of an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture, wherein one or more mono olefins with two to four carbon atoms per molecule or aliphatic hydrocarbon mixtures, at least 20 wt. of which consists of the said olefins, are contacted in a first stage at a temperature of between 325 and 550 C with a catalyst containing a crystalline metal siilcate wherein the reaction product of the first stage is separated into a C₄ fraction and a C₅ fraction, wherein the C₄ fraction is con tacted in a second stage at a temperature of 450 700 C that is at least 50 C higher than the temperature employed in the first stage with a catalyst containing a crystalline gallium si licate. The relation between the C₅ content and the aromat ics content in the hydrocarbon mixture obtained is im proved.
