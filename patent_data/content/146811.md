# HIGH TEMPERATURE FILMS AND COATING SOLUTIONS FOR USE IN THE MANUFACTURE OF SEMI CONDUCTOR INTEGRATED CIRCUITS

## Abstract
A coating solution is provided for use in forming planar, thermally stable, dielectric films having a low mobile ion content and good planarizing properties. The solution con tains a specific, uncured poly imidazopyrrolone imide copolymer dissolved in a polar organic solvent such as, for example, 1 methyl 2 pyrrolidinone, N,N dimethyl acetamide, N,N dimethylformamide, or dimethylsulfoxide, and has a solids content of from about 5 to about 40 , a solution viscosity of from about 0.2 to 3.5 Pa s, a sodium ion content of less than about 5 ppm, and a maximum particle size of about 0.2 micron. The solution may also contain a diluent, such as, for example, super highflash naphtha, toluene, or xylene. Also provided are films formed from the cured poly imidazopyrrolone imide copolymer and semi conductor devices including these films.
