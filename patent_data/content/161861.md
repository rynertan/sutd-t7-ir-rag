# Continuous annealing method and apparatus for cold rolled steel strips.

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus for continuously annealing cold rolled steel strips successively passing through a preheating zone, a low temperature heating zone, a high temperature heating soaking zone, a primary cooling zone and a secondary cooling zone. In each zone, the steel strip is driven by hearth rolls alternately upward and downward in a serpen tine path. According to the invention, in a high temperature zone such as the high temperature heating zone and the primary cooling zone whore the steel strip is prone to heat buckling, the steel strip is caused to pass only once in a single direction without along the serpentine path, thereby prevent ing meandering and heat buckling of the steel strip.
