# Method and apparatus for forming fiber reinforced coupling sleeves and product thereof.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method is provided for fabricating plain end pipe couplings. Ribbons 140 of resin soaked fiber reinforced plastic strands are wrapped about a rotating operably expandable mandrel 1 which has placed there around a pliable resilient collar 9 which defines an inner surface of such a coupling. After curing, the wrapped ribbons form a rigid coupling. The mandrel is thereafter collapsed and the coupling removed therefrom. The pliable collar is then separated from the coupling.
