## Description
A surface cleaning machine This invention relates to a surface cleaning machine of the kind in which abrasive grit is projected at high velocity against a surface to be cleaned. Thus the surface is subjected to an abrasive blast which is produced for example by a vaned blast wheel rotating at high speed, to fling or project the abrasive grit Titk reat force on to the surface so as to blast clean from it all dirt. The abrasive grit used is usually fine stcel shot and such material ill be referred to herein for brevity as grit .Dirt to be cleaned from the surface may be of various kinds, for example dust, paint, oil, rust, or other contaminants or coveriigs, and mixtures of them these will be referred to herein for brevity as dirt . Various machines of the type referred to are known, see for example British Patent Specification No.1,496,268 and U.S. Patent Specifications Nos. 3,034,262 3,380,196 and 3,691,689. A machine of the kind referred to above may be required to clean various kinds of surfaces having various kinds of surface contaminants. For example a concrete floor surface nay be covered with a mixture of oil and dust, or a metallic tank surface may be covered with a mixture of paint and rust, and so on.But it has been found that satisfactory and qui k cleaning of various surfaces and contaminations involves different eleaning conditions. ror example some surfaces and contaminations can be cleaned more easily than others thus a lighter weight of grit could be used, or a less powerful blast effe could be used, or a combination of both. Existing machines of the type referred to cannot however give the ne ssary versatility, particularly in terms of varying the blast cleaning effect of the grit on the surface to be cleaned. It has been found in using machines of ihe kind referred to above that if grit is projected from a blast wheel at a maximum angle of approximately 80 to the surface to be cleaned, the blast cleaning effect is greateThus it is the practice to mount the blast wheel and its drive motor so that the grit is flung in a plaJie generally at right angles to the axis of rotation of the wheel alone an incident path inclined at 800 to the horizontal, if the machine is used fo. cleaning a floor or other horizontal surface. If te machine is used for cleaning a wall or other vertical surface, then the incident path will be at 80 to the vertical.When the grit is projected at the surface at 80 thereto, there is a substantial rebound effect, which is used, together with an air flow, in reclaiming the grit for further use and in transporting tic dirt for subsequent removal from a part of the maci0iiie rem from the surface. It has also been found that if the angle is reduced, the blast cleaning effect will be reduced. Thus for severe contamination, an angle of 800 could he used, but for less severe contamination, a lesser angle could be used. The invention is therefore based on the problem of providing a surface cleaning machine of the kind referred to above, which can be readily used for cleaning different kinds of surfaces with different kinds ok surface contaminants. According to this invention tiscie is provided a surface cleaning machine of the kind in which abrasive grit is projected at high velocity against a surface to be cleaiied, the machine comprising i an enclosure with an opening therein ii sealing means disposed around the opening so as to contact the surface to be cleaned and so as substantially to retain abrasive grit and removed dirt ,ithin the enclosure iii a projecting device for projecting abrasive grit at high velocity along an incident path through the opening to a zone of the surface to be cleaned iv a reclaim channel through which passes abrasive grit and dirt from the cleaned surface zone v an air inlet near the said opening for providing an air flow through the reclaim channel vi a main receiving container to receive abrasive grit from the reclaim channel for return of the abrasive grit to the projecting device, characterized in that a an additional receiving container is provided to receive abrasive grit from the reclaim channel, the additional receiving container having an outlet of adjustably variable size b an opening or openings is provided for removal of air from the air flow, the opening o openings being upstream of the abrasive grit received in the additional receiving container c the main receiving container is disposed in such a position in relation to the said outlet that abrasive grit passes in the form of a moving curtain from the additional receiving container to the main receiving container d an air inlet for flow of air into the main receiving container is arranged so that the air passes through the moving curtain of abrasive grit to remove dirt therefrom. Thus in the machine of the invention the additional receiving container, preferably in the fonn of a hopper, collects reclaimed grit mixed with dirt.To avoid compaction of the grit in the additional receiving container, air pressure in that container may be reduced by removing air, preferably from the reclaim channel, upstream of the grit in the additional receiving container The grit mixed with dirt can then flow through the outlet from the additional receiving container and this outlet is of adjustably variable size, Ec that the curtain of grit which flows from it into the main receiving container or hopper can be maintained according to the weight or size of grit being used. It is to be noted tat different grits will be used for different surfaces and contaminants.The air inlet into the main receiving container provides a flow of air through the curtain of grit entering the main container, to remove the dirt, which is generally of lighter weight than the grit, from the grit. In this way the dirt is blown away from the grit. It is preferable that the air inlet into the main container be of adjustably variable size, so that the air flow through the main container can be varied to suit the various kinds of operating condition. Thus for example for removal of dirt which is light in weight, less air is required to flow through the main receiving container. The opening or openings previded for removal of air from te air flow is or are also p crabby of variable adjustable size so that the amount of air removed from the air flow can be controlled according uo tlie particular operating requirements. The projecting device for projecting the abrasive grit may be mounted in the machine so that the angle between the incident path of the projected abrasive grit and the surface to be cleaned can be adjustable varied. Thus if the projecting device is a vaned blast wheel rotatable at high speed, it may be so mounted in the machine that its axis of rotation may be moved, to change the angle of the incident path. Preferably a driving motor, a shaft carrying the blast wheel, and the blast wheel, together with housing parts forming a channel along which the grit is projected, constitute a unit or head which is tiltable as a whole about a hingeing axis. rhen the angle between the incident path and the surface to be cleaned is reduced, the rebound effect is reduced and it is necessary to rely more on a flow of air within the machine to reclaim the git and remove the dirt. It is therefore also necessary to provide for a greater flow of air in the machine than has previously been required. But with known machines, greater air flow produces a higher speed air flow in the reclaim channel, particularly in that in some machines there is a venture effect by virtue of the shape of the reclaim channel.This produce various disadvantages the grit, by virtue of its speed of movement and by virtue of the air pressure, can become compacted in the receiving container or hopper to which it is returned before being fed to the blast wieel for re use and the grit, by virtue of the friction imparted to it by its high velocity motion in contact with the walls of the reclaim channel, becomes heated, so that some kinds of removed dirt, for example paint, clings to the grit and cannot be easily separated from the grit and evacuated to a dirt collector, which is usually a container to which stro suction is applied and which is usually also the source of the air flow through the machine.Thus, with a greater flow of air to transport dirt away from the cleaned surface zone and along the reclaim path to the receiving container, the air may be largely removed from the air flow so as to reduce the effect of the air flow on the dirt before it reaches the hopper. Preferably the opening or openings is or are in the form of louvres through which te air and some of the dirt is removed to the dirt collector.Preferably also the louvres are adjustably movable to provide for variation of their area, to suit various operating conditions, whereby a greater or lesser amount of air can be removed from the reclaim channel. The reclaim channel may be in the known form of a closed channel of rectangular cross section, except that the cross section is the same or virtually the same throughout the length of the channel from the cleaned surface zone to te additional receiving container when the projecting device is in the position for maximum blastcleaning effect. The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the drawings, in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic section through a machine in accordance with the invention, as seen on the vertical plane in which the axis of the blast wheel lies Figure 2 is a diagrammatic section as seen on a plane at right angles to the plane of figure 1 and looking towards the blast wheel and Figure 3 is a diagrammatic enlarged detaii section of part of Figure 1. Referring to the drawings, there is seen a surface cleaning machine of the kind in which a surface l to be cleaned is subjected to a high velocity blast 2 of abrasive grit which blast is produced by a vaned blast wheel 3 mounted on a shaft 5A and driven by a hydraulic motor 5B at high speed, for example 3400 to 3850 r.p.m.The machine has an enclosure, formed by the various plates seen in Figure 1, as will be described, and the enclosure has an opening 4 at the surface 1. The opening 4 is rectangular in plan and has sealing means disposed around it this sealing means comprises double sealing strip members 5A, 5B, 5C and 5D respectively at each side of the opening and in contact with the surface 1. The area of the surface 1 within the opening 4 at any time is the zone which is to be clcaiied and to which abrasive material in the form of grit 6 is flung by the blast wheel 3 along an incident path. In the position shown in full lines in Figure 1 the incident path includes an angle of approximately BOO with the surface 1. Grit is indicated by the reference numeral 6 in sacral parts of the machine . The machine is mounted for movement on a forward castor wheel 7A and rear driven wheels 7B, 7C Fig. 9 driven by a motor not shown . The grit rebounds from the surface zone up into a reclaim channel 8 which is formed by a curved front reclaim channel plate 8A parallel spaced side plates of which one is seen at 8B and a rear reclaim channel plate 8C which is pivotally swingable about a hinge axis 9 from the full line position to the dot dash line position shown it will be seen that in the latter position the plate 8C is still below the upper edges of the spaced side plates 8B, one of which upper edges is indicated at 8B . The enclosure is formed by the reclaim channel and also by the several plates enclosing the blast wheel a front plate 10A, rear plate 1QB, side plates 10C and top plate 10D. The machine also includes a main receiving container in the form of a lower hopper 11 which includes inclined forward and rear plates llA, 11B respectively an additional receiving container or upper hopper 12 which also includes inclined forward and rear plates 12A, 12B respectively and a return channel 15 for air and dirt and having upper and lower walls 13A, 13B respectively. At the front of the machine is a dirt collector 14, into which dirt removed from the cleaned surface zone by the grit is sucked and stored, somewhat in the maner of a vacuum cleaner. The dirt collector 14 has an outer box like casing 14A, the rear wall of which is open at 14B for movement of air and dirt into it. The collector 14 also includes dust bags 15 with support cages 15A. Air flow for the dirt collector and for the whole machine is provided by a fan 16 driven by a hydraulic motor 16A and having an exhaust 16B. A quick release, adjustably programmable electronic pulsar valve 16C and associated air tank 16D are mounted on the casing 14A as shown. The grit projecting device comprises the vaned blast wheel 3, with its shaft 3A and motor 3B, and the various plates enclosing the blast wheel. This constitutes a unitary structure or head which can be pivotally, adjustably moved about a hinge 17 mounted oil the machine side plates SB. In one embodiment, the blast wheel is 35 cms. in diameter and has seven curved vanes.An operators handle is seen at 18. The grit projecting device is movable from the full line position to the dot dash line position and can be fixed in either position, or in an intermediate position, by means not shown. In tie full line or 800 position there is maximum cleaning effect and maximum grit rebound effect. These effects decrease progressively in various positions of the head until the minimum dot dash line position is reached, when the rebound effect cannot be used to any extent for grit reclaim, so that reliance must be placed more on air flow for reclaim of grit. Grit is fed from the main hopper 11 to the blast wheel through a grit flow control valve 19 and extensible flexible corrugated ducting 20.An extensible gas cnti cllcd strut 21 supports the grit projecting device and is connected at its forward end to brackets 21A fixed to the side plates 8B and at its rear end to brackets 21B on the plate 10A.The rear reclaim channel plate 8C is hingedly connected at 22 to the plate 10A, so that when the grit projecting device is moved, the plate 8C moves with it about the hinge 9, and between the side plates 8B. Within the housing formed by the several plates 10A lOD is a blast liner this comprises an inner housing of heavy cast metal to contain the grit it surrounds the blast wheel, as indicated at 23 Fig. 2 and also defines the path of the projected grit, as indicated at 24. A heavy lincr is needed to withstand the wear caused by the grit normal steel plating as used for other parts of the machine onld very quickly be worn away. The double front and rear sealing members 5A, 5B are all preferably of a resilient urethane strip.There is an additional outer front seal 5E. The double side sealing members comprise an inner manganese steel strip and an outer resilient urethane strip. An air intake 25 to the cleaning zone includes a brush like screen 25A which permits entry of air, but retains grit and dirt. The intake 25 is adjustable, for control of the amount of air drawn in. The air intake is at the top of a channel 2513 opening dolunwardlv near the surface 1 at the rear of the zone 4. The indrawn air is thus drawn dowrnardly in a controlled amount to the zone 4 this keeps in motion any grit or dirt which tends to become idle and to accumulate near the rear sealing members 5B as the machine is moved forwardly, that is, to the right as seen in Figure 1. Also as seen in Figure 1 the reclaim channel S is curved and parallel sided in the full line position, so that the air flow upwardly in the reclaim channel 8 is not subject in that position to a venturi effect and its speed is not increased. The construction is such that its crosssectional area at the level of the hinge 9 remains constant, even when the rear reclaim channel wall 8C is swung upward X to the dash dot line position, so that in the latter position the speed increase of the air flow is not significant.The air outlet, and one dirt outlet, from the reclaim channel 8 is by way of openings 26 having rockable louvres or flaps 26D,Figure 3. The construction of these flaps is not shown in detail they are pivotally mounted and can be opened or closed to the required degree by an arrangement of rollers 26A mounted on a rod 26D movable by a handle 26C as indicated by the double headed arrow in Figure 3. It will be noted that the air is largely removed from the air flow upstream of the surface 12C of the grit collected in the upper or additional hopper 12, so that downstream of the louvres 26 the air speed and pressure is low whereby compaction of the grit in the upper hopper 12 is not increased. The wall 1313 forms the upper surface of the upper hopper 12 and is a continuation of the wall sn doi7strea of the louvres 26. The wall 1513 is curved and provides for smooth flow of the grit to the upper hopper 12 and in practice most of the impact of the reclaimed grit is absorbed by the surface 12C of the mass of reclaimed grit already in the upper hopper 12. From the upper hopper 12 the reclaimed grit falls through an outlet 27 which is of adjustably variable size having a weight controlled flap valve 27A and down into the main hopper 11. The flap valve 27A operates in dependence on the weight of the grit in the upper hopper. The less the grit, the less the fall and vice versa. The grit falls in the form of a curtain 6A.In the wall lIA of the main hopper 11 is an air inlet of controllable size, having an adjustable flap valve 2SA, through which inlet air can be drawn so as to pass through the falling curtain 6A of grit and remove more dirt from it the removed dirt travels along the path indicated by the arrows through the return channel 13 and thence to the dirt collector 14 through the opening 1413. Passage of the air through the curtain 6A assists in further cooling the latter, as well as cleaning it. The cleaned and cooled grit collects as a mass in the lower or main hopper 11 and is returned by way of the controllable valve 19 and ducting 20 to the blast wheel 3. In one set of adjusted operating conditions of the machine of the invention, grit flow from the blast wheel is approximately 365 kgs. per minute air flow in the machine is 34 to 45 cu. metres per minute. The crosssectional area of the reclaim channel at the level of the hinge axis 9 is approximately 510 sq. cms. The size of the reclaim ciianiiel ill the present embodiment is 46 cms. x 11.5 cms., the latter dimension being in the plane of the drawing.The total maximum area of the louvres 26 is 175 sq.cms.The air intake is 116 sq.cms. The above is one set of operating colclitions, By adjustment of the various parts, other sets of conditions can be provided, according to the cleaning requiremcnt, weight of grit, and so on. For example the degree of opening of the louvres can be varied, as can that of the valve 28, to control the air flow If necessal louvres of different sizes could be interchangeably fitted. Referring to Figure 3, the louvres 26D and the flap valve 28t can be operated in uni son. This is shown diagrammatically as follows. Fixed to the handle 26C is a pivot lever 26E which is connected by a link 29 to a pivot lever 2SB fixed to the pivot shaft 28C of the flap valve 2SA. Thins when the handle 26C is operated to adjust the louvres 26D, the flap valve 28A is also adjusted. If the louvres 26D are adjusted to reduce the air flow through them, the flap valve 28A is adjusted to increase the amount of air entering the main hopper 11 through the inlet 28. The flap valve 27A is also connected to the pivot lever 26E by a link 30 in generally similar manner, for control of the amount of grit falling through the opening 27. It is also possible for the flap valve 2SA to be connected to the pivot lever 26E, but not the flap valve 27A. Thus the openings 26 and 28 can be controlled in unison, but the opening 27 can be controlled separately, for example by a lever not shown connected to a pivot shaft not shown of the flap valve 27A, a weight not shown being movably mounted on the lever.
