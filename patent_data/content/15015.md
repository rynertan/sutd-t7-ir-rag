# Vehicle suspension.

## Abstract
A wheeled vehicle, such as a coach, is provided with a suspension system for road wheels comprising an axle 12 , with a road wheel at each end, a transverse beam 20 parallel to the axle 12 , and structural members 21,22 coupling the axle 12 to the beam 20 , each extremity of the transverse beam being spaced from the vehicle body by a resilient means 24,25 the members 21,22 having parallel resilient exten sions 31,32 on the opposite side of the axle 12 to the beam 20 . The end 35,36 of each extension 31,32 remote from the axle is pivotably coupled to an anchorage on the vehicle body forwardly of the axle 12 . Each extension 31,32 has a cross section whose area reduces as the distance of the cross section from the axle 12 increases.

## Description
This invention relates to a suspensz√ßln for a wheeled vehicle.A low floor height is desirable in a vehicle, such as a coach, to which access needs to be readily had from outside the vehicle.The need for a low floor height can conflict with the use of previously knows suspensions which make use of coil springs which in a low floor arrangement would result in extensive intrusions through the floor and into the vehicle interior. A solution to the question of intrusion is to utilise air springs which can be made of relatively short length.However sufficient length suspension travel can introduce further problems particularly if the vehicle has a wide range of load capacity.A motor vehicle suspension is disclosed in UK Patent 1,350,057 in which an axle is located longitudinally of the vehicle by a pair of longitudinally extending arms each arm comprises a spring steel leaf disposed in a substantially vertical plane one end of each leaf is pivotably connected to the vehicle body structure and the leaf is fixed to the axle so that the twisting movement of the axle relative to the body structure is accommodated by twisting of the leaf but rotation of the axle is resisted by the leaf and suspension springs are mounted between the body structure and the arms at the end of the arms remote from their pivotal mounting to the vehicle body structure and the axle is fixed to the arms between the suspension springs and the pivotal mountings.With a suspension of this kind a considerable area is needed beneath the floor of the vehicle to accommodate components of sufficient size to provide the desired charactistic, It is also difficult to use such a suspension for steerable vehicle wheels.The present invention is intended to provide a suspension for a low floored vehicle which does not take up an excessive amount of underfloor space and which is also adapted to provide a steering system for the vehicle. According to the present invention a wheeled vehicle having a suspension comprising an axle having provision for at 1 st one wheel at each end of the axle, the axlc being located longitudinally of the vehicle by a pair of longItudinally extending arms which project both in front of and behind the axle is further characterised by i a beam parallel to and behind the axle ii resilient means spacing the beam from the remainder of the vehicle iii the arms projecting forwardly of the axle serving in a vertical plane as resilient extensions the end of each resilient extension remote from the axle being pivotable coupled to an anchorage on the vehicle each resilient extension having a cross section whose area reduces as the distance with the section from the axle increases and iv that part of the pair of the longitudinally extended arms which project behind the axle serving as rigid connections between the axle and the beam.Preferably the axle or the beam, or both, are coupled to the remainder of the vehicle by motion damping means.Preferably the axle is of I beam section.Preferably the beam is laterally located relative to the rest of the vehicle by a Panhard rod.Preferably the or each wheel at each end of the axle incorporates a steering linkage whereby the vehicle can be steered.by way of the wheels.Preferably the axle has a lowered central portion on which a steering crank is pivotably mounted.An examplary embodiment of the invention will n be described with reference to the accompanying drawings of a suspension system for 2 double deck bus of which Figure 1 is a plan view Figure 2 is a section of Il Il of Figure 1 andFigure 3 is a prespective view.The drawings show a sub frame 11. This includes an axle 12 of I section with road wheels 13, 14 mounted on the axle by way of bearings 15 to enable the wheels to be steered by way of steering arms 16,17 and track rods 18,19.Beam 20 is rigidly secured to the axle 12 by way of rectangular section beams 21, 99 . The bearn is spaced from the vehicle body 23 Figure 2 by way of air springs 24,25 positioned at the extremities of the beam to give high roll stiffness and eliminate the need for an anti roll bar. The air springs can readily be replaced by coil springs to make an all steel suspension. Rebound travel of the sub frame is limited by shock absorbers 28,29 pivotably coupled at one end to the axle 12 and at the other to body 23.The beams 21,22 are secured TO axle by bolts 30.Single leaf springs 31,32 project forwardly of the axle and are integral extensions of, respectively, beams 21,22. The beams 21,22 are constant crosssectional ones to maintain the high roll stiffness induced by the outboard air springs, whereas the leaf springs 31,32 are tapered, that is to say each crosssection has a reducing area as the distance of the section from the axle 19 increases. The leading ends 35,36 of springs 31,32 are pivotably attached by pins 33 Figure 2 to mounting anchorages on vehicle body 23.A safety strap 37,38 is provided for respective springs 31,32 to control motion of the parts of the related taper leaf and sub frame should the taper leaf fracture.A Panhard rod 39 is provided tolocate the sub frame 11.End 42 of the rod 39 is coupled by pivot 43 to vehicle body 23. Track rod 18,19 are coupled by a steering relay crank 44 to a connecting link 45, which is coupled to a drop arm of a conventional steering geari box. The crank 44 is pivotably mounted on an extension 46 integral with axle 18.
