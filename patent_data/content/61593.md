# Solder support pad for semiconductor devices.

## Abstract
A controlled geometric configuration of contact pads 1 for securing solder mounds to semiconductor chip reduces cracking of brittle passivating coatings 58 in the fabrication of components. A bottom Cr layer 2 , a concentric intermedi ate Cr Cu layer 4 and a top Cu layer 3 have tapered, wedge shaped peripheral portions. The intermediate and the top layers have about the same diameter, whereas the bottom layer is larger.
