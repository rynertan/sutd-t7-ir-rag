# DISC BRAKE

## Abstract
A disc brake comprising a carrier member 4 secured to a non rotatable part of a vehicle, a caliper member 7 supported on the carrier member 4 and being displaceable relative thereto in the direction of the axis of a rotatable disc, and a pair of parallel pins 5,6 guiding the displacement of the caliper member 7. In order to prevent accidental separation of the caliper and carrier members 4,7 during pad replacement engaging portions 10,11, 13,12, 15,16 are respectively provided on the carrier and caliper members 4,7 to engage with one another when one of the pins 6 is removed, the caliper member 7 is angularly rotated around the other pin 5 by a predetermined angle, and when the caliper member 7 is displaced in one direction with respect to the axis of the disc.
