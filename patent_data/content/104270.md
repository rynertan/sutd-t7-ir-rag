# Robot control apparatus.

## Abstract
A robot control apparatus for controlling the movement of an arm 7 of a robot 6 with respect to a workpiece 2 transported upon a pallet 1 moving down an assembly line, wherein the position of the arm of the robot is compensated for in accordance with the position of the workpiece. A reference position memory stores a reference position of one of the pallet and workpiece. A position detector 16, 17 detects the position at which the pallet of workpiece is clamped along the assembly line. A difference between the outputs from the reference position memory and the posi tion detector is used to correct a value stored in a work position memory to thus provide the output data which controls the movement of the arm of the robot.
