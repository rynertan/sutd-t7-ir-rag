# A PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF FABRIC PIECES FOR CURTAINS OR BLINDS

## Abstract
A process for the production of fabric pieces 2 for curtains or blinds, such as strip blinds, roman blinds, roller blinds and the like, which consists substantially in cutting lengths of fabric 2 of predetermined dimensions from a piece 1 of the fabric made of synthetic or mixed fibres. An important peculiarity of the invention is constituted by the fact that the cutting of each length of fabric 2 is effected with heated cutting means to obtain, simultaneously with the cutting, a heat fixing of the cut threads at least along the lines of the cut 3 . Moreover, heat stabilization lines 4, 6, 4a, 6a can also be effected, these being obtained by means of localised softening of the threads in the perimetral zones as well as in central portions of the fabric 2 . Such heat stabilization lines 4, 6, 4a, 6a can be of any form.
