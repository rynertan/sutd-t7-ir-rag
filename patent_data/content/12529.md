# Production of thermonuclear ignition in a plasma.

## Abstract
A method of achieving thermonuclear ignition in a magnetically confined plasma, for example in a tokamak, in which the plasma is initially heated ohmically by the plasma current and subsequently by the injection of neutral beam until the ionic and electronic temperatures are sub stantially above those required for ignition.

## Description
PRODUCTION OF THERMONUCLEAR IGNITION IN A PLASMA This invention relates to the production of thermonuclear ignition in a plasma. It is primarily intended for use in a machine in which a plasma is magnetically confined in a shape of a toroid one such machine is a tokamak but although the invention will be particularly described in relation to its use in a tokamak, it is intended that the invention should have utility in other reactors, for example stellarators. The production of ignition in a plasma, ignition being the condition in which the energy released by thermonuclear fusion in the plasma exceeds all losses of energy from the plasma, requires the confinement of the plasma at a temperature, at which the nuclei are energetic enough to overcome their mutual electrostatic repulsion, for at least a minimum time, known as the energy confinement time. ignition requires the quantity 3 nl n2 K Ti Te E to to be equal to or less than nln2 sv , where nl and n2 are the densities of the reacting nuclei, K is Boltzmann s constant, T. and T are the temperatures of the ions and I e electrons respectively, is the energy confinement time of the plasma, svEis the average microscopic cross section of the thermonuclear reactions and depends on temperature alone and Q represents the energy released in the plasma for each fusion reaction.For convenience of explanation, it may be presumed that the plasma is constituted by 50 each of deuterium and tritium, so that nl n2 n. The afbrementioned condition then reduces to the condition that nlCbe equal to or greater than 6KSTi Te sv Q. By way of example, ignition for a plasma constituted as aforesaid requires the attainment of a temperature of 12ke and that the quantity nt be of the order of 4x102 m The necessary presence of an electric current in a plasma in a tokamak or other magnetic confinement device makes convenient the use of ohmic resistive heating. IIowever, because the conductivity of the plasma varies according to the power of three halves of the temperature, ohmic heating becomes increasingly ineffective as the temperature rises. For example, a temperature corresponding to approximately 3keV is at present a practical limit. Other methods of heating a plasma are known or have been proposed they include.adiabatic compression, radio frequency heating and the injection of a neutral beam. The last named method, injection of a neutral beam, is capable of producing the temperature required for ignition, but practical limitations on the penetration of the plasma by the injected beam prevent the attainment of a mean density which is sufficiently great for ignition. Although it might be feasible to increase the density of a toroidal plasma electromagnetically, for example by altering the component of magnetic field normal to the plane of the toroid so as to reduce the orbital radius of the plasma and thereby the nuclear density within t, such an expedient would require an excessively large machine in order to accommodate the radial contraction of the plasma. According to the present invention, in order to achieve thermonuclear ignition in a confined plasma, the confined plasma is heated to a temperature above that required for ignition at the final density of the plasma and the nuclear density of the plasma is increased by refuelling the plasma with relatively cold gas. It is demonstrable that notwithstanding the fall in temperature during such refuelling, the density of the plasma can be increased sufficiently to ensure that the criterion for ignition is fulfilled. The accompanying Figure illustrates a typical progression of electronic temperature Ter ionic temperature Ti and electronic density n, shown in solid, dashed and dotted lines respectively, against the abscissa of time in, for example, a small ignition tokamak. It is intended that the method according to the invention should be performed in presently available tokamaks or, mutates mutandis, other reactors in which ignition is to be attained in a confined plasma a description of the construction and manner of operation of a tokamak is omitted for the sake of brevity. It will be supposed that the plasma is a mixture of deuterium and tritium as hereinbefore mentioned. There are four phases in the progression illustrated by the accompanying Figure the ends of the respective phases are marked by the letters A to D. The precise numbers quoted in the following paragraph are intended to be by way of example only. The first phase, 0 to A, is a phase in which the temperature of the plasma is increased by the ohmic resistive heating effect of the electric current in the plasma. Although ohmic heating might not be necessary to the performance of the invention, such a current is normally present in the plasma and is required for the magnetic confinement of the plasma. Accordingly the elllploylnent of ohmic heating is quite convenient. At the end of the first phase, the temperatures T and T 1 e are, for example, 2.88keV and 3.lkeV respectively the mean electronic density is for example, of the 20 order of 2.3 times 10 m 3 At the time A, representing an elapsed time of approximately 400 milliseconds, additional heating is supplied. It is at present preferred that the additional heating should be by the injection of a neutral beam, for example beam of deuterons at a beam injection energy of l6OkeV, which is a practical limit at present, and at a power of, for example, 18 megawatts. During the phase A to B which occurs at 1.22 seconds a cold neutral fuel gas supply should be held steady at the same value that pertains at the timeA until 1.06 seconds from 0.The intense beam of deuterons has a significant effect on the tritium ratio and to obtain an ultimate value of that ratio during ignition it is desirable to start the discharge with a high concentration of tritium and to monitor carefully the tritium ratio of the cold neutral gas surrounding the plasma. The effect of the neutral beam s heating of the plasma is quite dramatic and raises the temperatures Ti and T 1 e to approximately 17keV and 16.5keV respectively. Initially, the neutral beam heats the electron preferentially but after the lapse of about 100 milliseconds, even though alpha particle heating goes preferentially to the electrons, the major source of power during the phase A B is the beam heating of the ions of the plasma. In consequence T. is greater than T . Although some heating by alpha particles produced e thermonuclearly will commence during this phase, it will not,in the absence of neutral beam injection heating or an appropriate substitute, increase sufficiently to become the dominant source of heating. At the time B, cold neutral gas is puffed into the device to increase the density of the plasma in order to satisfy the criterion for ignition. There is, during the phase B C a drop in temperature because the main power must heat more plasma. There is some increase in ohmic heating owing to the fall in temperature and the nett effect of the changes in temperatures and density is a decrease in transport losses. This phase, B C is the critical one that determines whether full ignition is reached or not. The supply of cold gas must not be too fast, or else the discharge might be quenched or disrupted, but must proceed sufficiently rapidly to increase the plasma density for satisfaction of the ignition criterion before the temperature falls too far.In the present example the puffing of cold gas ceases at the time C 1.24 seconds after commencement when ng is 3 approximately 4.2 x 10 20 m s. The average density of electrons is increased, as shown in the Figure, twofold in about 180 milliseconds. The final phase, C D, indicates the achievement of ignition and the consequential controlled thermonuclear fusion, selfsustaining nuclear heating balancing all power losses. It further indicates a critical case if the ignition criterion is fulfilled at a temperature greater than those indicated, the temperatures T. and T may I e increase subsequent to the time C. Whether the plasma is thermally stable after ignition depends on the nature of the power losses for the case in the figure the assumed loss mechanisms are such that the ignited plasma is thermally stable.
