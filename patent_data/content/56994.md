## Description
This invention relates to an improved process for preparing a diester of oxalic acid by the vapor or gaseous phase catalytic reaction of carbon monoxide with an ester of nitrous acid in the presence of a catalyst composed of a solid carrier and a platinum group metal or a salt thereof supported on the carrier. According to this process, the diester of oxalic acid can be produced at a high space time yield and especially high selectivity with reduced formation of a carbonic acid diester and carbon dioxide as by products. A further advantage of this process is that the amount of the platinum group metal used can be decreased and it can be easily recovered. More specifically, the present invention relates, in a process for preparing a diester of oxalic acid by the vapor phase catalytic reaction of carbon monoxide with an ester of nitrous acid in the presence of a catalyst composed of a solid carrier and a plantinum group metal or a salt thereof supported on the carrier, to the improvement wherein said solid carrier is silicon carbide. The process for preparing a diester of oxalic acid by the vapor phase catalytic reaction of carbon monoxide with an ester of nitrous acid in the presence of a catalyst composed of a solid carrier and metallic palladium or a salt thereof supported on the carrier is known U. S.Patent No. 4,229,591 . This patent cites active carbon, alumina, silica, diatomaceous earth, pumice, zeolite and molecular sieves as examples of the solid carrier, but fails to disclose anything about a silicon carbide carrier. Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 22666 1980 published on February 18, 1980 corresponding toUK Patent Application 2025950A discloses another process for the production of a diester of oxalic acid by a similar vapor phase catalytic reaction to that shown in the aboveU. S. Patent. The Japanese patent document exemplifies palladium, rhodium, iridium, platinum, gold and salts of these metals as ingredients of the catalyst, and silica, magnesium oxide, aluminum oxide, zinc oxide, Cr203 and pumice as examples of the carrier. It also exemplifies iron, copper and salts of these as a carrier which concurrently serves as a catalyst promoter. This patent publication is quite silent on the use of a silicon carbide carrier. The present inventors made investigations in order to provide a process for producing diesters of oxalic acid at a high space time yield and an especially high selectivity. These investigations have led to the discovery that the use of a silicon carbide carrier which is not at all recognized in the prior art brings about an improvement.in the mechanical strength, stability and durability of the catalyst and the selectivity of the desired product. In order to utilize expensive noble metals efficiently in carrier supported noble metal catalysts, it is necessary to increase the degree of dispersion of the noble metals. Usually, therefore, carriers of a high specific surface area have been selected in the past.It has now been found in accordance with this invention that by using silicon carbide as a carrier, high selectivities can be achieved even when it has a low specific surface area, for example a specific area measured by theBET method utilizing the adsorption of nitrogen gas of about 0.001 to about 1 m2 g. It has also been found that the use of the silicon carbide carrier increases the strength of the catalyst against heat changes, and makes the excellent selectivity of the desired product longlasting. The present inventors have also discovered that such a catalyst composed of silicon carbide as a carrier and a platinum group metal or a salt thereof supported on the carrier is prepared especially preferably by impregnating the silicon carbide carrier with an aqueous solution of a water soluble salt of the platinum group metal, treating the ir regnated silicon carbide carrier with an alkali, and subjecting the alkali treated product to reducing treatment in the liquid or gaseous phase. It is an object of this invention therefore to provide an improved process for the preparation of a diester of oxalic acid by vapor phase catalytic reaction. The above and other objects and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description. The catalyst used in the process of the invention is a catalyst composed of a silicon carbide carrier and a platinum group metal or a salt thereof supported on the carrier. Examples of the platinum group metal are palladium, platinum, rhodium, ruthenium and iridium.These metals may, if desired, be used as a mixture of two or more. The use of palladium, either alone or with another metal of the platinum group, is preferred. The salt of the platinum group metal include nitrates, sulfates, phosphates, halides, acetates, oxalates, and benzoates of the above exemplified metals. The silicon carbide carrier used in this invention needs not to be chemically pure, and may include a small amount, for example up to about 30 by weight, preferably up to about 20 by weight, of impurities.Such impurities include, for example, silica, carbon, alumina, iron oxide, potassium oxide, sodium oxide and potassium oxide. The size and shape of silicon carbide may be properly selected. For example, it has a diameter of about 1 to about 10 mm, preferably about 2 to about 6 mm, and is in the form of spheres, pellets, etc. The amount of the catalytic metal component to be supported can be properly selected. It is preferably 0.01 to 10 by weight, more preferably 0.1 to 2 by weight, calculated as the metal based on the weight of the silicon carbide carrier. There is no restriction on the manner of supporting the catalytic metal component on the silicon carbide carrier, and any known means of supporting can be used. Preferably, however, the catalyst is prepared by impregnating silicon carbide with an aqueous solution of a water soluble salt of the platinum group metal, treating the impregnated alumina carrier with an alkali, and then subjecting the product to reducing treatment in the liquid or gaseous phase. Examples of the water soluble salt are nitrates, sulfates, acetates, phosphates, chlorides and sodium complex salts of the above exemplified platinum group metals. The impregnation may be performed by dipping silicon carbide in the aqueous solution of the platinumgroup metal salt at a temperature of, for example, aboutO to about 900C for a period of, for example about 0.1 to about 10 hours. If desired, it can be effected by spraying the aqueous solution of the platinum group metal salt onto silicon carbide. Preferably, the aqueous solution of the platinum group metal salt is a solution prepared by dissolving the platinum group metal salt in an acidic aqueous solution containing about 0.01 to about 10 by weight of an acidic compound. The use of the acidic aqueous solution serves to aid in the dissolving of the platinum group metal and to prevent the formation and precipitation of a hydroxide and oxide of the platinumgroup metal by hydrolysis. Compounds having the anionic group of the platinum group metal salt can generally be used as such acidic compounds. Specific examples include mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid and organic acids such as acetic acid.These acidic compounds may, if desired, be used as a mixture of two or more. The silicon carbide impregnated with the aqueous solution of the platinum group metal salt is then separated, and if desired washed with water and then dried by, for example, air drying, vacuum drying or heat drying, after which it is subjected to the alkali treatment. The alkali treatment can be effected by adding the silicon carbide impregnated with the aqueous solution of the platinum group metal salt to an alkaline aqueous solution containing about 0.5 to about 10 by weight of an alkaline compound, and stirring the mixture at a temperature of, for example, about 10 to about 90 0C for a period of, for example, about 0.5 to about 10 hours. Examples of the alkaline compound include the hydroxides and salts of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, for example sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate and potassium carbonate. If desired, these alkaline compounds may be used as a mixture of two or more. There is no special limitation on the amount of the alkaline compound used.Preferably, it is about 2 to about 40 moles per mole of the platinum group metal salt. After the alkali treatment, the product is optionally washed with water, etc. and dried. The product is then treated with a reducing agent in the liquid or gaseous phase to form the final catalyst. The liquid phase reduction is carried out by using such reducing agents as hydrazine, formaldehyde, sodium formate and formic acid. Specifically, it can be carried out by adding the alkali treated product to an aqueous solution of the reducing agent in a concentration of about 0.5 to about 10 by weight, and stirring the mixture at a temperature of, say, about 10 to about 50 0C for a period of, say, about 0.5 to about 10 hours. The alkaline treated product may be added directly to the aqueous solution of the reducing agent in performing the reduction. It is more effective, however, to separate the alkali treated solid product by a solidliquid separating procedure such as filtration or decantation, wash and dry it in the manner described above, and then add the dried product to the aqueous solution of the reducing agent in the liquid phase. Examples of reducing agents suitable for use in the gaseous phase reduction are hydrogen, carbon monoxide and ammonia. These reducing agents may be used after being diluted with inert gases such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide. The gaseous phase reduction can be carried out by passing the gaseous reducing agent through the alkalitreated product at a temperature of, for example, about 50 0 to about 500 C for a period of, say, about 1 to about 10 hours. The starting gases used in the synthesis of diesters of oxalic acid in accordance with the process of this invention are carbon monoxide and a nitrous acid ester, and as required, may also include an alcohol, a nitrogen oxide, etc. to be described hereinbelow. In any case, the starting gases include carbon monoxide which is effective for the aforesaid reducing treatment. Thus, the gaseous phase reduction of the alkali treated product may also be effected by a procedure which comprises filling the alkali treated product into a reactor for the synthesis of a diester of oxalic acid, and prior to the synthesis of the diester of oxalic acid, treating it with a starting gaseous fixture of carbon monoxide and a nitrous acid ester optionally containing an alcohol, a nitrogen oxide, etc. The final desired catalyst can be formed by performing the reduction in the above manner. In the case of the liquid phase reduction, the treated product may be washed with water, etc. and dried. According to the process of this invention, carbon monoxide is reacted with an ester of nitrous acid in the vapor phase in the presence of the resulting catalyst composed of silicon carbide and a platinum group metal or a salt thereof supported on the carrier. This reaction can schematically be shown below. EMI7.1 R alkyl or cycloalkyl As the above scheme shows, this reaction yields nitrogen monoxide equivalent to the consumed nitrous acid ester. Accordingly, the nitrogen monoxide thus formed may be recycled as the starting material for the above reaction by introducing an alcohol and a gas containing molecular oxygen to react them with the nitrogen monoxide as schematically shown below and recovering the resulting nitrous acid ester.EMI7.2 R alkyl or cycloalkyl An ester of nitrous acid with a saturated monohydric aliphatic alcohol having 1 to 8 carbon atoms or an alicyclic alcohol having 1 to 8 carbon atoms is preferred as the ester of nitrous acid. Examples of the aliphatic alcohol are methanol, ethanol, n propanol, isopropanol, n butanol, isobutanol, sec butanol, tert butanol, n amyl alcohol, isoamyl alcohol, hexanol and octanol, and examples of the alicyclic alcohol include cyclohexanol, and methylcyclohexanol. These alcohols may contain a substituent, such as an alkoxy group, which does not inhibit the reaction. The concentration of the ester of nitrous acid used may be varied over a wide range. To obtain a satisfactory rate of reaction, it is desirable to adjust the concentration of the nitrous acid ester in the starting gaseous mixture introduced into the reactor at 1 by volume or higher, for example about 5 to about 30 by volume. Carbon monoxide used in the process of this invention may be pure or may be diluted with an inert gas such as nitrogen. The concentration of carbon monoxide in the reaction zone may be varied over a wide range and is usually in the range of 10 to 90 by volume. The reaction is carried out under such conditions that no liquid phase is formed in the reaction zone namely, in the gaseous or vapor phase . These conditions may vary depending upon the reaction temperature, the reaction pressure, the type and concentration of the nitrous acid ester, etc. Thus, these conditions may be properly selected so that the reaction is carried out in the vapor phase. The reaction proceeds rapidly even at low temperatures, and side reactions occurs less as the reaction temperature is lower. It is desirable therefore to perform the reaction at relatively low temperature at which the desired space time yield can be maintained, for example at a temperature of about 500C to about 2000C, preferably 0 0 at about 80 C to about 150 C. The reaction pressure can also be selected properly. For example, it is atmospheric 2 pressure to about 10 kg cm .G, preferably atmospheric pressure to about 5 kg cm2.G. Pressures below the abovespecified lower limit, for example reduced pressures of down to about 200 mmHg, can also be used. The catalytic reaction in accordance with this invention may be carried out in a fixed or fluidized bed.The time of contact between the starting gaseous mixture and the catalyst can be properly chosen. For example, the contact time is not more than about 20 seconds, preferably about 0.2 to about 10 seconds. The nitrous acid ester can be prepared, for example, by reacting an alcohol with a nitrogen oxide in the optional presence of molecular oxygen. The reaction product gas contains the unreacted alcohol and nitrogen oxide particularly nitrogen monoxide and at times, traces of water and oxygen in addition to the desired nitrous acid ester. In the process of this invention, this product gas containing the nitrous acid ester can be used as the starting nitrous acid ester, and the platinum group metal catalyst supported on silicon carbide exhibits excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity even when a nitrous acid ester containing such impurities is used. The following Examples illustrate the present invention more specifically.Example 1 1 Preparation of a supported catalyst Palladium chloride 1.12 parts by weight was dissolved in 29.9 parts by weight of a 1.54 by weight aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid, and 30 parts by weight of silicon carbide having a purity of 85 the remainder consisting of 11 of silica and 3 of alumina 2 having a specific surface area of less than 1 m g was dipped in the solution.
