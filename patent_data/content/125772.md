# Fiber reinforced glass matrix composites.

## Abstract
What is disclosed is a method of preparing fiber rein forced glass composites from high modulus fibers, such as carbon fibers and silicon carbide fibers, and silazane polym ers. The composites are obtained by heating a pressed and post cured prepreg to an elevated temperature in an inert atmosphere. Prepregs containing containing silicon carbide fibers can be fired in air. A simple, low temperature laminating procedure is used in the preparation of these composites in place of the standard hot pressing technique.
