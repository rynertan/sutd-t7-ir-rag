## Description
AQUEOUS LATEX COPOLYMER COMPOSITIONS The present invention relates to aqueous latex copolymer compositions which are particularly suitable for use in the provision of contact adhesives. A contact adhesive is a substance which when coated on two substrates to be bonded enables a strong bond to be formed between the substrates on and after initial contact at ambient temperature without the requirement of any sustained pressure or setting time.The contact adhesive is applied to each substrate dissolved or dispersed in a liquid medium, the solutions or dispersions allowed to dry on each substrate, and the dried adhesive layers undergo rapid interfilm coalescence on contact to form almost instantaneously a strong bond this property is known as contactability. In the past, contact adhesives have usually been applies as solvent bBsed compositions, i.e. in compositions wherein the adhesive substance has been dissolved in an organic liquid solvent. However, in recent years attention has been focussed on the toxicity, flammability and pollution problems associated with such systems. This has stimulated a desire to employ systems where the contact adhesive is less hazardously applied as an aqueous based composition, i.e. in a composition wherein the adhesive substance is dispersed in water. Currently, aqueous based contact adhesive compositions appear to be mainly of two types Neoprene or modified Neoprene type compositions and acrylate type compositions. Examples of th former type are described in US Patent 4 130 528 while examples of the latter type are described in US Patents 2 976 203, 2 976 204, 4 057 527, 4 280 942, and British Patent 1459843. The search for new aqueous based contact adhesive compositions nevertheless continues with the objective of obtaining an improved balance of properties such as contactability, mature bond strength and high temperature creep performance. In an initial approach to this problem we discovered that certain aqueous latex compositions comprising mixtures of two different types of copolymers were possessed of excellent utility as contact adhesive compositions. One such aqueous latex composition comprises a mixture of an amorphous copolymer type A comprising polymerised units of vinylidene chloride, an internally plasticising comonomer like 2 ethylhexyl acrylate or n butyl acrylate, optionally vinyl chloride and optionally a copolymerisable acid, and having Tg in the range 50 to C0 C, and another amorphous copolymer type B comprising polymerised units of vinylidene chloride, an alkyl acrylate and or methacrylate or certain other comonomers, optionally vinyl chloride, and optionally a copolymerisable acid, and having Tg in the range 0 to 300C.This type of composition is described in our European Patent Publication No. 0119698. Another such aqueous latex composition comprises a mixture of an amorphous copolymer type A comprising polymerised units of certain selected monomers preferably including vinylidene chloride, an internally plasticising comonomer like 2 ethylhexyl acrylate or n butyl acrylate, optionally vinyl chloride, and optionally a copolymerisable acid, and having Tg in the range 50 to oec, and a crystalline copolymer type B comprising polymerised units of vinylidene chloride, and having a Tg which is not more than 30µC. This type of composition is described in our EuropeanPatent Publication No. 0119699. As an optional feature in these aqueous latex compositions, both types of copolymer in each composition can include polymerised units of a comonomer which provides a cross linking functionality, such a comonomer causing cross linking during the polymerisation to form the copolymer and or providing a latent cross linking functionality whereby cross linking occurs after the copolymer has been formed eg. on or after bond formation either under the influence of an added cross linking agent or without the requirement for such an agent. We have now discovered that the aqueous latex compositions of the type described in European PatentPublications Nos 0119698 and 0119699 may be further improved by careful selection of the modal molecular weight of the copolymer of type A in either composition.The present application is directed towards the improved compositions of European Patent Publication No 0119698, while our copending application of even date is directed towards the improved compositions of European PatentPublication No 0119698. According to the present invention there is provided an aqueous latex composition comprising at least one copolymer A and at least one copolymer B, wherein A is an amorphous copolymer comprising polymerised units of at least one internally plasticising comonomer, and which copolymer has a Tg in the range 50 to 0 C and B is a crystalline copolymer comprising polymerised units of vinylidene chloride, and which copolymer has a Tg which is not more than 80 C and wherein the dry weight ratio of the at least one copolymer A the at least one copolymer B is from 95 5 to 10 90 and wherein said at least one copolymer A has a modal molecular weight Mp as herein defined within the range 100,000 to 700,000 and wherein said composition provides contactable layers after drying. There is also provided according to the invention the use of an aqueous latex as defined above as a contact adhesive forming composition. In accordance with the conventional method of contact bonding, such use is generally effected by coating two substrates to be bonded with the said aqueous latex composition, allowing the aqueous coating on each substrate to dry, and bringing the dry coated substrates into contact usually at ambient temperature and usually without any sustained pressure to effect contact. The new aqueous latex compositions of the present invention possess a still further advantageous combination of properties for contact adhesive purposes than compositions exemplified in European Publication No 0119699 in which all copolymers A used in those examples had Mp well below 100,000, and in particular provide consistently improved combinations of shear strength and creep resistance for dried layers as well as having comparably good other properties such as contactability and 7 day bond strength. In this specification, modal molecular weight Mp is defined as the molecular weight at the peak maximum of the molecular weight distribution curve obtained using a gel permeation chromatograph packed with beads of divinyl benzene gel and calibrated with polystyrene samples of known molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution Weight Average Molecular Weight Mw NumberAverage Molecular Weight Mn 1.05 to 1.07 to give a linear calibration between polystyrene molecular weights of 1000 and 3.6 X 106. The weight average and number average molecular weights Mw and Mn and hence the heterogeneity index may also be determined from this distribution curve. The vinylidene chloride copolymer and polystyrene samples for gel permeation chromatography are used as solutions of 0.02g polymer in 10 ml ofH.P.L.C. grade tetrahydrofuran. It is to be understood that the value of Mp used herein is the measurement obtained using only substantially gel free copolymer. A copolymer A as used according to the invention may, if desired although usually it is not preferred , have a degree of cross linking that has been produced during the polymerisation this may result in a proportion of gel which, in a sample to be used for the estimation of Mp, is removed by filtration of the tetrahydrofuran solution to be injected into the gel permeation chromatograph before the measurement of Mp. The copolymer A used in the invention should haveMp within the range 100,000 to 700,000 if its Mp is below 100,000, an aqueous composition having the improved balance of contact adhesive properties tends not to be obtained. A modal molecular weight Mp of above 700,000 is in our experience unattainable for the copolymer A used for this invention due to competing chain transfer reactions during polymerisation. The copolymer A used in the invention usually has Mp within the range 100,000 to 500,000, and more usually within the range 100,000 to 400,000 nevertheless copolymers A with Mp within the range 500,000 to 700,000 are not excluded from the present invention. The Mp of copolymer B is not critical in the present invention and can be above or below 100,000. By Tg is meant the glass transition temperature and it will be noted the Tg of copolymer B is not restricted to being less than or equal to 300C as in the compositions of European Publication No 0119698 but can have Tg in the range which is not more than 800C. The copolymer A preferably comprises polymerised units a of at least one monomer selected from alkyl acrylates and methacrylates having 1 to 12 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, alkoxyalkyl acrylates and methacrylates having 1 to 12 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, vinylidene chloride, vinyl chloride acrylonitrile, styrene, vinyl acetate and vinyl ethyl ether. The copolymer A preferably also comprises polymerised units of at least one copolymerisable ethylenically unsaturated acid. The copolymer B generally comprises polymerised units of vinylidene chloride and polymerised units b of at least one comonomer selected from alkyl acrylates and methacrylates having 1 to 12 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, alkoxyalkyl acrylates and methacrylates having 1 to 12 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, vinyl chloride, styrene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, vinyl ethyl ether, ethylene, cis and trans 1,3 butadiene, cis and trans isoprene, cis and trans chloroprene, l decene, l pentene and 1 octene. The copolymer B may optionally comprise polymerised units of at least one copolymerisable ethylenically unsaturated acid. The copolymer B used in the present invention provides a resin which is partially crystalline with greater than 5 crystallinity and more usually greater than 15 crystallinity , being either crystalline in the latex particles or crystallising on and or after removal of the aqueous carrier as for example on and or after bond formation particularly at ambient temperature.This provides a bond with very good low creep characteristics. It is to be understood that the crystallisation may often be slow. The copolymer A is amorphous with less than 5 and more usually substantially zero crystallinity being non crystalline while in the latex and not crystallising on and or after removal of the aqueous carrier as for example on and or after bond formation. The weight ratio of the at least one copolymer A the at least one copolymer B is from 95 5 to 10 90. The preferred range is 85 15 to 15 85, particularly 80 20 to 20 80 with 75 25 to 25 75 being a typical range in practice . The aqueous latex compositions of the invent Ion normally comprise only one copolymer A and only one copolymer B, although it is within the scope of the invention to include more than one copolymer A and or more than one copolymer B. Other addition polymers may also be included if they have no deleterious effect. The disposition of copolymers A and B in the aqueous latex composition of the invention is in the form of a mixture of the copolymers. This mixture may e.g. be a simple aqueous latex blend of the at least one copolymerA and the at least one copolymer B prepared by blending together aqueous latices of the separately prepared copolymers. Alternatively, the mixture may be made in situ by forming the at least one copolymer A in the presence of the at least one copolymer B, or vice versa, using a sequential polymerisation process. When more than one copolymer A and or copolymer B is used, these may be mixed by simple blending, or by a sequential polymerisation process, or by a combination of simple blending and sequential polymerisation. The Tg of a copolymer will primarily be determined by the types and amounts of the individual comonomer units in the copolymer. Accordingly a variety of copolymers may readily be prepared having Tg within the ranges specified. it may be noted that the Tg of a vinylidene chloride copolymer cannot be determined from a formula instead it is necessary to determine the Tg of such a copolymer by experiment. Typical examples of Tg verses composition relationships for vinylidene chloride copolymers are given in Polyvinylidene Chloride , R AWessling, Gordon and Breach, Science Publishers 1977. By an internally plasticising comonomer is meant a comonomer which gives a homopolymer when polymerised alone of very low Tg, preferably 40eC, more preferably 50 C, and so provides copolymerised units in a copolymer which if present in sufficient proportion tend to cause the polymer to be intrinsically plasticised and thereby have considerably lowered Tg in comparison to a polymer not having such units. Thus the use of such comonomers allows various desired values of Tg to be readily achieved.Suitable plasticising comonomers include certain kinds of alkyl and alkoxyalkyl acrylates such as n butyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, n decyl methacrylate, n octyl acrylate, 2 ethylbutyl acrylate, n heptyl acrylate, 2 heptyl acrylate, n hexyl acrylate, 3 methylbutyl acrylate, n nonyl acrylate, 2 octyl acrylate, n propyl acrylate, l ethoxyethyl acrylate, l ethoxypropyl acrylate, 2 methoxyethyl acrylate, 3 methoxypropyl acrylate and propoxylated acrylates and methacrylates, and other monomers such as ethylene, cis and trans 1,3 butadiene, cis and trans isoprene, cis and trans chloroprene, l decene, l pentene, and l octene. Of these, n butyl acrylate and 2 ethylhexyl acrylate are usually preferred internally plasticising comonomers for copolymer A with n butyl acrylate being particularly preferred. It is thus apparent that in copolymer A, the polymerised units of the at least one plasticising comomomer can be provided by certain suitable polymerised units within the scope of a e.g. from certain of the alkyl acrylates and methacrylates and alkoxyalkyl acrylates and methacrylates having 1 to 12 carbon atoms in the alkyl group as exemplified in the list above and or from suitable polymerised units outside the scope of a . The composition of copolymer A should be selected to provide a Tg in the range from 50 to 0 C, and more preferably in the range from 40 to 50C. Possible copolymer compositions for A include polymers comprising 10 to 100 weight of polymerised units a other than those of vinyl chloride, 0 to 90 weight of polymerised units of at least one internally plasticising comonomer other than one or ones forming polymerised units within the scope of a , 0 to 50 weight 9s of polymerised units of vinyl chloride, and 0 to 10 weight of polymerised units of at least one copolymerisable ethylenically unsaturated acid. Preferred copolymer compositions for A include copolymers comprising 10 to 70 weight of polymerised units of vinylidene chloride, 30 to 90 weight of polymerised units of at least one internally plasticising comonomer, 0 to 50 weight of polymerised units of vinyl chloride, and 0 to 10 weight of polymerised units of at least one copolymerisable ethylenically unsaturated acid.Minor amounts of polymerised units of other ethylenically unsaturated monomers may optionally be included in these preferred polymer compositions of A. The proportion of polymerised units of vinylidene chloride in the above mentioned preferred copolymer compositions for A is more preferably 20 to 60 weight . The proportion of polymerised units of the at least one internally plasticising comonomer in the above mentioned preferred copolymer compositions for A is more preferably 40 to 80 weight . The proportion of polymerised units of vinyl chloride in the above mentioned preferred copolymer compositions for A is more preferably 0 to 20 weight and still more preferably 0 to 15 weight . The proportion of polymerised units of copolymerisable acid in the above mentioned preferred copolymer compositions for A is more preferably 0.1 to 8 weight , still more preferably 0.1 to 5 weight , and yet more preferably 0.1 to 3 weight 96. The composition of copolymer B should be selected to provide a Tg which is not more than 80eC. Preferably the Tg of B is within the range from 50 to 80 C, and more preferably within the range from 20 to 60 C. Other ranges are 50 to 300C and 20 to 300C. Preferred copolymer compositions for B are the copolymers comprising 70 to 98 weight 96 of polymerised units of vinylidene chloride, 2 to 30 weight 96 of polymerised units b , and 0 to 10 weight of polymerised units of at least one copolymerisable ethylenically unsaturated acid. Minor amounts of polymerised units of at least one other ethylenically unsaturated monomer may optionally be included in these preferred polymeric compositions of B. The proportion of polymerised units of vinylidene chloride in the above mentioned preferred copolymer compositions for B is more preferably 80 to 95 weight . The proportion of polymerised units b in the above mentioned preferred copolymer compositions for B is more preferably 2 to 20 weight . The proportion of polymerised units of copolymerisable acid in the above mentioned preferred copolymer compositions for B is more preferably 0.1 to 8 weight 96, still more preferably 0.1 to 5 weight , and yet more preferably 0.1 to 3 weight . The copolymer B may include polymerised units of at least one internally plasticising comonomer, such as ethylene, cis and trans 1,3 butadiene, cis and trans isoprene, cis and trans chloroprene, l decene, l pentene and 1 octene, and also certain kinds of alkyl and alkoxyalkyl acrylates and methacrylates as exemplified by the list provided above in respect of copolymer A, in order to readily achieve a desired value for Tg within the defined range. Such alkyl and alkoxyalkyl acrylates and methacrylates as exemplified above fall within the scope of the said alkyl and alkoxyalkyl acrylates and methacrylates having 1 to 12 carbon atoms in the alkyl group which comprise at least one of the comonomers which may be used to form the polymerised units b in copolymerB.The copolymer B may of course include polymerised units of at least one monomer within the scope of alkyl or alkoxyalkyl acrylates and methacrylates having 1 to 12 carbon atoms in the alkyl group which is not an internally plasticising comonomer. In some embodiments the copolymerB includes units of at least one comonomer other than vinylidene chloride of the non internally plasticising type e.g. Tg 40 C and no units of an internally plasticising comonomer, or vice versa. In other embodiments both types of unit are present. In copolymer B, the at least one comonomer providing polymerised units b selected from alkyl acrylates and methacrylates having 1 to 12 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, alkoxyalkyl acrylates and methacrylates having 1 to 12 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, vinyl chloride, styrene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, vinyl ethyl ether ethylene, cis and trans 1,3 butadiene, cis and trans isoprene, cis and trans chloroprene, l decene, l pentene, and l octene ether is preferably at least one comonomer selected from alkyl acrylates and methacrylate having 1 to 12 carbon atoms in the alkyl group and vinyl chloride.Examples of such alkyl acrylates and methacrylates include n butyl acrylate and methacrylate, sec butyl acrylate, tert butyl acrylate, cyclohexyl acrylate, n dodecyl acrylate and methacrylate, ethyl acrylate and methacrylate, 5 ethyl 2 nonyl acrylate, 2 ethylbutyl acrylate, n heptyl acrylate, n hexyl acrylate, isobutyl acrylate and methacrylate, isopropyl acrylate and methacrylate, methyl acrylate and methacrylate, 2 methylbutyl acrylate, 3 methylbutyl acrylate, n octyl acrylate and methacrylate, 2 octyl acrylate, 3 pentyl acrylate and methacrylate, n propyl acrylate, and 2 ethylhexyl acrylate and methacrylate. As discussed above, some of these monomers are of the internally plasticising type while others are of the non internally plasticising type both types of monomer may be used, either together or alone. Preferably the at least one comonomer selected from said alkyl acrylates and methacrylates having 1 to 12 carbon atoms in the alkyl group and vinyl chloride is at least one of methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, 2 e thylhexyl acrylate, and vinyl chloride. The copolymer A and or the copolymer B of the present invention may optionally contain polymerised units of at least one multi functional comonomer that has effected, when present, a partial in the sense of a degree of cross linking during the polymerisation resulting in the formation of some insoluble gel , as this can sometimes improve the creep performance properties of the copolymer. Multi functional comonomers providing this type of crosslinking are polyunsaturated monomers examples of which include allyl methacrylate, diallyl maleate, diallyl phthalate and divinyl benzene. Thus units of such multi functional comonomers can be present in an amount usually in the range of up to 10 weight 96, i.e. the copolymer may comprise 0 to 10 weight of such units, preferably 0.01 to 5 weight .Nevertheless, even though such cross linking may be used, it is not usually preferred that a copolymer A and or B according to composition of the invention contains such polymerised units this is because the partial crosslinking effected during polymerisation sometimes adversely effects the contactability properties of the resulting composition, and, although a small degree of such crosslinking can be tolerated, it is not recommended as a general rule. Besides optionally including polymerised units of at least one multi functional comonomer which causes cross linking during polymerisation, the copolymer A and or B of the invention may also optionally possess polymerised units of at least one comonomer which provides a latent cross linking functionality a latent cross linking functionality is one where the functional group or groups of the comonomer cause cross linking not during polymerisation but subsequent to polymerisation e.g. on or after bond formation , and this can also sometimes enhance the creep properties of the copolymer composition. The latent cross linking functionality can be one which is activated by the presence in the composition of a cross linking agent e.g. a divalent metal ion such as zinc or can be one which is activated without the requirement for a cross linking agent e.g. spontaneously at ambient temperature on ageing or more usually under the influence of heat. Examples of comonomers having a latent type of cross linking functionality where latent cross linking is possible either at ambient temperature on ageing, or by heating, or by virtue of an externally added cross linking agent or by more than one of these possibilities, have functional groups capable of cross linking by various mechanisms including self cross linking or mutual cross linking by different functional groups, both in the polymer chain examples of comonomers providing this type of cross linking funtionality include comonomers having reactive polar groups such as hydroxyl, thiol, amino, amide, isocyanate, nitrile, carboxy, and epoxide groups.Examples of such comonomers include glycidyl methacrylate and acrylate, methylaminoethyl methacrylate and acrylate, t butylaminoethyl methacrylate and acrylate, methacrylamide, 4 pentanoguanamine, hydroxylalkyl esters such as hydroxypropyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate and hydroxyethyl acrylate, methacrylonitrile,N alkoxyalkyl amides such as methoxymethyl methacrylamide and butoxy methyl acrylamide, and hydroxyalkyl amides such as N methylol methacrylamide and N methylol acrylamide, and dicarboxylic acids such as maleic acid. The at least one monomer to provide a latent cross linking functionality is usually used in an amount to provide 0 to 10 weight and, if present, usually 0.01 to 10 weight of polymerised units in the copolymers A and B. In the copolymers A and B in the compositions of the invention the at least one ethylenically unsaturated copolymerisable acid, if used, which primarily provides an adhesion promoting functionality, is preferably an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid or a sulphonic acid, such as 2 acrylamide 2 methylpropane sulphonic acid.Particularly preferred acids are aliphatic alpha, beta unsaturated carboxylic acids and especially acrylic acid other carboxylic acids of this type which may be used include methacrylic acid, itaconic acid and citraconic acid. Other monomers which provide an adhesion promoting functionality may be used in conjunction with or in place of the ethylenically unsaturated acid e.g. in an amount of 0 to 10 weight . It may be mentioned that the at least one ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid can also provide units which impart a latent cross linking functionality as discussed above if the composition includes a cross linking agent. The polymerisations to form the copolymers A and B may be carried out by known emulsion polymerisation techniques e.g. copolymerisation in an aqueous medium using a free radical yielding initiator, and usually in the presence of a surface active agent. A modal molecular weight Mp within the range 100,000 to 700,000 for the vinylidene chloride copolymer A of the invention may be achieved by appropriate adjustment of the polymerisation process to produce polymer of higher than usual molecular weight. For example, molecular weight can be increased by decreasing the polymerisation temperature however a decrease in temperature below about 40µC may not be commercially attractive because heat transfer becomes difficult, with the result that long polymerisation reaction times and or very low cooling water temperatures are required. One effective method of increasing molecular weight to enable a modal molecular weight Mp within the defined range to be attained at the usual commercially attractive polymerisation temperatures e.g. 40 to 70 C entails performing the polymerisation in such a way that the polymerisation is monomer flooded for at least a substantial part, say at least 20 , of the polymerisation.By the term monomer flooded is meant that at any given instant during which the polymerisation is in this state then there is a significant proportion of free, unpolymerised monomeric material present in the reaction medium say more than 5 by weight based on the weight of polymer plus monomer in the reaction medium at that instant . Preferably the polymerisation is monomerflooded for, say, at least 40 of the polymerisation. By contrast, vinylidene chloride based copolymerlsations are often performed under monomerstarved conditions for most of the polymerisation i.e.the polymerisation is not monomer flooded for most say more than 80 of the polymerisation in order to obtain a homogeneous copolymer or in order to minimise reaction pressure. It may be mentioned here that all the exemplified copolymers A and B in our European PatentPublications 0119668 and 0119669 were performed under monomer starved conditions . A typical procedure would be to add 5 to 20 by weight, based on total monomeric material to be polymerised, of an initial monomer mixture to the reaction vessel and to react these monomers to an high degree of conversion say to at least 95 conversion , and to then feed the remaining monomers at a rate such that the free monomer concentration in the reaction medium does not rise during this stage of thee polymerisation.Often, the initially introduced monomers are reacted to a very high conversion to form what is referred to as a seed latex. Such monomer starved vinylidene chloride based copolymerisations when used in an attempt to produce copolymers according to the invention do not generally yield molecular weights of 100,000 or above at reaction temperatures of 40 C or above. The proportion of free monomer present at any moment of time during polymerisation can be determined by sampling the polymerisation vessel, e.g. by using a pressure tight sample bomb, and analysing for free unpolymerised monomer by gas liquid chromatography. In practice a far simpler method to determine whether a polymerisation is monomer flooded or monomer starved at any stage of the polymerisation is to allow the polymerisation to proceed as before but to introduce no additional monomer. If the polymerisation is monomer starved the polymerisation reaction will die away quite quickly e.g. within 2 10 minutes . On the other hand, if the polymerisation is monomer flooded the reaction will continue unaffected over this time scale. There are a various ways of ensuring that the polymerisation is monomer flooded for a substantial proportion of the polymerisation, e.g. A Addition of more than, say, 20 by weight of the monomers to be polymerised, but less than the total amount to be polymerised, to the reaction vessel before the start of polymerisation and commencement of monomer feeding before the initial monomer mixture has reacted to a high degree of conversion. It is desirable in this variant to feed the remainder of the monomeric material at such a rate that the polymerisation remains monomer flooded as defined above. In practice this monomer flooded condition is maintained by controlling the rate of monomer addition relative to the rate of initiation. If however a large proportion of the monomer mixture say more than 40 by weight of the total monomers to be polymerised is added to the reaction vessel before the start of polymerisation, then it will be appreciated that it is less important, though nevertheless desirable, that the subsequent monomer feeding stage of the polymerisation is maintained in a monomer flooded state because high molecular weight polymer will be produced during the initial stage of the polymerisation. B In an especially preferred method1 monomer flooding is ensured for a substantial proportion of the polymerisation by performing a series of separate monomer introductions often of equal weight and composition discontinuous monomer feeding . Thus, for example, the monomer mixture to be polymerised is divided into a number of equal portions e.g. 5 to 10 , one portion is added to the reaction vessel and polymerisation is commenced. This portion is then reacted to, say, greater than 90 conversion and a second portion of the monomer mixture is then added. This procedure is repeated until all the monomers have been introduced and polymerisation completed. This variant has the advantage of giving both high molecular weight and good colloid stability i.e. low coagulum formation and can be employed to give the desired modal molecular weight Mp within the defined range at the usual commercially attractive polymerisation temperatures e.g. 40 to 70 C . It will be appreciated that the above two described techniques are only examples of how the polymerisation might be operated in a monomer flooded condition, and that there are other possible detailed modifications of the procedure that could be employed to achieve the same objective. The copolymer A used in the composition of the invention may optionally include a minor fraction say up to 30 by weight of much lower molecular weight than that of the rest of the copolymer having Mp well above 100,000 this may further enhance the contactability of the composition, although the effect is not always apparent.The production of such a copolymer A may be conveniently effected by conducting the copolymerisation to form copolymer A under conditions to give high molecular weight material, e.g. using monomer flooded conditions, until most of the comonomers for the copolymerisation have been converted to copolymer say 70 to 90 by weight and then changing the polymerisation conditions so that the last part of the copolymerisation is performed under conditions to give low molecular weight material, e.g. using monomer starved conditions and adding a chain transfer agent, thereby yielding the minor low molecular weight fraction. The modal molecular weight of the copolymer B is not critical typically Mp for copolymer B may be well below 100,000. The aqueous latex composition of the invention preferably contains at least one tackifying resin in order to maxlmise the contact adhesive performance of the composition. A tackifying resin is a polymeric substance, usually a particular type of condensation polymer, known to the art for further improving the adhesive performance of adhesion promoting polymers. Therefore according to a further aspect of the invention there is provided an aqueous latex composition as defined above, wherein said composition includes at least one tackifying resin. The at least one tackifying resin if employed is normally present in an amount of 5 to 100 96, more usually 10 to 60 by weight, based on the combined dry weight of the copolymers A and B. Suitable tackifying resins include phenolic resins such as heat reactive alkylphenol formaldehyde resins, hydroxyalkylated alkylphenol formaldehyde resins, polyhydric phenol formaldehyde resins, polyhydric, polynuclear phenol formaldehyde resins, phenol formaldehyde resins, and thermoplastic terpene phenolic resins. The tackifying resin is preferably incorporated by simply mixing into the composition with appropriate agitation, e.g. stirring an aqueous dispersion of the tackifying resin, although the resin can be emulsified in situ. The aqueous latex composition of the invention may also include substances such as thickeners, stabilizers, humectants, fillers, surfactants, pigments, dyes, fungicides, coalescing agents, cross linking agents, and or other material required for any particular application. Such substances if used may be incorporated or formulated into the latex compositions of the present invention by any suitable technique, e.g. by simple mixing and stirring. The composition of the present invention may be used to provide contact adhesion for a variety of substrates, the materials joined either being the same or more usually different. Such substrates include wood, paper, natural or artificial textiles, various forms of panelling such as plyboard, particleboard, plasterboard, various plastics materials, various minerals such as glass, asbestos, carbon fibre, concrete, plaster and ceramics, and metals such as iron, steel and aluminium. The present invention is illustrated by the following examples the prefix C for an example denotes a comparative example unless otherwise specified all parts, percentages and ratios are on a weight basis. Contactability in the examples is assessed by applying two brush coats of the aqueous latex composition intended to provide the contact adhesive to unproofed cotton duck i.e. unproofed canvas , allowing the first brush coat to dry as indicated by a clearness of the adhesive film before applying the second coat. When the second adhesive coat is dry the coated surfaces are brought together under light hand roller pressure to form the adhesive bond the strength of which is then tested immediately as a 25 mm wide strip on an Instron tensile testing machine set at a crosshead speed of 10 cm minute.By considering the initial bond strength it is possible to determine whether interfilm coalescence has occurred and hence whether or not the adhesive is contactable. Creep at elevated temperatures of creep resistance unless otherwise specified is determined by preparing a test specimen as for contactibility but ageing for 7 days prior to testing. Creep resistance is assessed by equilibrating the sample at 600C and recording the distance peeled or crept in mm minute under a static load of 1 kg.7 Day Bond Strength is determined by preparing a test speciman as for contactability but leaving to age for 7 days prior to testing for bond strength. 7 Day Shear Strength is determined by preparing a 25 mm square lap joint from 4.5 inch x 1 inch x 0.25 inchBeechwood test strips conforming to Appendix A of BS 1204, 1956. 0.15 ml of adhesive composition is applied to each surface to be contacted and allowed to dry before contacting. The bond is aged for 7 days prior to testing on an Instron tensile testing machine at a withdrawal rate of 5 mm minute. The procedure for measurement of modal molecular weights Mp of the copolymers exemplified as defined hereinbefore involved dissolving 0.02g of polymer in 10 ml of H.P.L.C. grade tetrahydrofuran and after fil tration through a 0.2 micron membrane injecting on to the gel permeation chromatograph at a solvent flow rate of 1 ml minute and a temperature of 40to. The weight of polymer eluted from the chromatograph was measured using anApplied Chromatograph Services mass detector, and was plotted as a function of elution time. Tg s for the copolymers were determined by differential scanning calorimetry.

A crystalline copolymer degree of crystallinity 27 as assessed by infra red spectroscopy for use as copolymer B in examples 1 to 7, C8 to C10 was prepared as an aqueous emulsion monomer starved conditions having the composition VDC VC EHA AA 89.5 4.7 3.8 2.0 andTg 3.50C. The Mp was not measured because the copolymer was insoluble inTHF on account of its high crystallity however, since it was made using monomer starved conditions it should have Mp below 100,000 . This was blended with the aqueous latices of copolymers A or A1 to provide aqueous latex compositions according to the invention in Examplesl to 7 and comparative aqueous latex compositions in Examples C10 to C12, the latices A or A1 used in each blend being indicated in Tables 1 and 2 above. The ratio of copolymer A or A1 to crystalline copolymer B in each blend dry weight ratio of latex solids was 70 30 w w in each case. The aqueous blend compositions were formulated with the tackifying resin aqueous dispersion Ucar Phenolic Resin dispersion BKUA 2370 manufactured by Union Carbide by mixing and stirring to give a polymer resin ratio of 3 1 w w solids.The resulting formulations of the latex blend compositions were tested for contact adhesive performance as indicated in the following Table 3.

EXAMPLE 11 A further example of a copolymer A for use according to the invention, having a composition and Tg similar to the copolymer A used for example 3, was prepared using monomer flooded conditions until a conversion of monomers to copolymer of about 80 by weight had been reached at which stage the polymer had Mp of 136,138. The remaining part of the polymerisation was carried our under monomer starved conditions in the presence of 2 lauryl mercaptan as chain transfer agent thereby introducing a minor amount of a low molecular weight fraction into the molecular weight distribution. The copolymer A was blended 70 30 w w with the latex of copolymer B described above.
