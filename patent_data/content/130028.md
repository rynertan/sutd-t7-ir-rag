# IMAGING METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
A method for generating a latent image on a substrate surface using a low current e.g. less than 2 10 Â³ amperes electrical discharge. The apparatus may include a movable carriage or roll 10 adapted to support a coated plate 20 and move it past an imaging assembly 30 . The discharge is maintained by a voltage source 60 controlled by switching means 65 in response to a pattern data processor 55 . The invention may be used, for example, to image lithographic plates, which plates may or may not contain a light sensitive material, from a digital source of image data.
