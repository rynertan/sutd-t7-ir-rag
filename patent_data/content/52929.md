Reference is made to applicants following EuropeanApplications European Patent Application No. , filed entitled Novel Group VA Salts andProcess for Preparing Same . European Patent Application No. , filed entitled Novel Group VA Ylides andProcess for Preparing Same . The disclosures of the foregoing applications are hereby incorporated by reference. Field Of The Invention The present invention relates to novel sulfonated Group VA ylides which are useful in the preparation of nickel ylide catalysts for the oligomerization of ethylene. This invention also relates tq a process for preparing such sulfonated ylides.Description Of The Prior Art It is well known in the art to use a variety of catalysts to oligomerize ethylene to higher molecular weight olefines. The term oligomerize has been employed, and is employed herein to describe the conversion of lower olefines such as ethylene to olefinic product of higher molecular weight, e.g., to dimer, trimer, tetramer and the like. The reaction rate and product distribution obtained are highly dependent on the exact catalyst composition and the reaction conditions employed. Two such general classes of catalysts are the Ziegler types consisting of aluminum trialkyls and the Ziegler Natta types consisting of aluminum alkyls or alkyl halides and titanium halides.Major disadvantages of aluminum alkyl catalysts are their highly reactive and pyrophoric nature and the fact that they must be used at relatively high temperatures, e.g., 200 275 C. and pressures, e.g., 2000 4000 psig 13,790 to 27,580 kPa . Although much milder reaction conditions are used when the aluminum alkyls are used in conjunction with titanium halides, product quality and ease of catalyst separation from products of both of these prior art types of catalysts are not as high as desired. An article by W. Keim, F.H. Kowaldt, R. Goddard and C. Kruger entitled Novel Coordination of Benzoylmethylene triphenylphosphorane in a Nickel OligomerizationCatalyst , in Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1978 No. 6, page 466, discloses the preparation of a nickel ylide by the following reaction EMI3.1 wherein cod represents 1,5 cyclooctadiene and Ph represents phenyl. It is reported that the resultant nickel ylide converts ethylene into alpha ale fins br polyethylene.Summary Of The Invention The novel sulfonated Group VA ylides of this invention are defined by the following Formula I EMI3.2 wherein R1, R2, R3, and R4 are either alike or different members selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl radicals having from about one to about 24 carbon atoms, preferably from about one to about 10 carbon atoms aryl radicals having from about six to about 20 carbon atoms, preferably from about six to about 10 carbon atoms alkenyl radicals having from about two to about 30 carbons atoms, preferably from about two to about 20 carbon atoms cycloalkyl radicals having from about three to about 40 carbon atoms, preferably from about three to about 30 carbon atoms aralkyl and alkaryl radicals having from about six to about 40 carbon atoms, preferably from about six to about 30 carbon atoms a halogen radical selected from the group consisting of fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, preferably chlorine a hydroxyl group an alkoxy or aryloxy group a hydrocarbyl group, such as defined above, carrying halogen, hydroxyl and a sulfonato group SO3 or an alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl or alkaryl group carrying a sulfonato group M is sulfur or oxygen, preferably oxygen F is phosphorus, arsenic or antimony, preferably phosphorus and A is the cationic residue of a base selected from the group consisting of an alkali metal hydroxide, an alkyl or aryl lithium, an alkoxide and a hydrocarbyl substituted ammonium hydroxide. The process for preparing the novel sulfonated ylides of this invention comprises sulfonating an ylide defined by the following Formula II EMI4.1 to obtain the sulfonated ylide defined by the followingFormula III EMI4.2 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, F and M are as defined above.The sulfonated ylide is reacted with a base selected from the group consisting of an alkali metal hydroxide, an alkyl or aryl lithium, an alkoxide and a hydrocarbyl substituted ammonium hydroxide to obtain the metal ylide defined by Formula I.Description Of The Preferred Embodiments In the preparation of the sulfonated ylides of this invention, the first step involves sulfonating a ylide defined by the following Formula II EMI4.3 wherein each of R1, R2 t R3, R4, F and M is as defined above to obtain the following sulfonated ylide defined by the following Formula III.EMI5.1 wherein each of R1, R2, R3, R4, F and M is as defined above. In some cases, for example, where R1, R2, R3 andR4 are phenyl, M is oxygen and F is phosphorous, the following Formula IIIa may more accurately describe the structure EMI5.2 This first step can be done, for example, by dissolving the ylide of Formula II in a suitable solvent, for example, a halogenated hydrocarbon, such as chloroform, dichloroethane, methylene chloride or methyl cliloro form, or a hydrocarbon solvent, such as heptane or hexane and then adding SO3 to the resulting solution. The ylide and sulfonating agent are generally employed in equal molar amounts, although excess sulfonating agent can be present, if desired.Temperatures can be in the range of about 0 to about 200 C., preferably from about 20 to about 1000C., pressures can be elevated, although atmospheric pressure is preferred, and reaction times can vary from about five minutes to about 24 hours, preferably from about ten minutes to about four hours. At the end of the reaction time the compounds defined by Formula III or IIIa are recovered by any suitable means. If the sulfonated desired product is solid, recovery can be effected by filtration, decantation or by centrifuging. If the desired product is dissolved in the reaction medium, recovery can be effected by distillation to remove the solvent therefrom. The sulfonated product is converted to the corresponding ylide by reacting the same with a base, such as an alkali metal hydroxide sodium or potassium hydroxide , an alkyl or aryl lithium n butyl lithium, methyl lithium or phenyl lithium , an alkoxide sodium methoxide or potassium t butoxide , a hydrocarbyl substituted ammonium hydroxide benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide , etc., to produce the novel ylide defined by Formula I. This can be done, for example, by suspending or dissolving the sulfonated ylide in a suitable liquid, such as water, an aicohol ethanol or isopropanol , an aromatic benzene or toluene , a hydrocarbon hexane or heptane , etc.The reaction temperature can range from about room temperature to about 200 C,, preferably from about room temperature to about 50 C., and the reaction time from about one minute to about four hours, or even longer, but preferably from about one to about two hours. Elevated pressures can be used, although atmospheric pressure will suffice. If the ylide obtained is a solid, recovery can be effected by filtration, decantation or by centrifuging. If the ylide is dissolved in the solvent, simple distillation is sufficient to remove the solvent, leaving behind the solid ylide. Specific examples of sulfonated ylides defined by Formula I which can be prepared in accordance with this invention are set forth in Table I. In this table and as used elsewhere herein, Ph represents phenyl, Me represents methyl, and Et represents ethyl.
