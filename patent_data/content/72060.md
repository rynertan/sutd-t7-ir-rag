# PROCESS FOR THE AGGLOMERATION OF SOLIDS

## Abstract
A process for the agglomeration of finely divided solids suspended in a liquid comprising passing the suspension of the solids in the liquid through an agglo meration zone under conditions of turbulent flow to gether with a binding agent to form agglomerates of the solids, wherein seed pellets having a particle size of at least 0.5 mm are passed through the agglomera tion zone as well and wherein the ratio of the amount of seed pellets to the amount of finely divided solids in the agglomeration zone is kept substantially constant.
