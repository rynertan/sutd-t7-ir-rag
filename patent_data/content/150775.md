# Method and apparatus for microbiological testing of liquids.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for the microbiological testing of liquids to identify and count living microorganisms contained therein includes a tubular sleeve 2A, 2B for collecting the liquid sample to which there is attached at one end a microporous membrane filter 5 . Each end 3, 4 of the sleeve has the shape of a female receptacle portion where into one end a container 20 , housing a culture medium can be nested by force for applying the medium to the underside of the filter and where into the other end a cover can he nested to provide a substantially tight sealing 35 of the device. Preferably, the tubular sleeve is in the form of a bellows the convolutions of which can be either compressed or expanded to correspondingly alter the volume of the sleeve between minimum and maximum values.
