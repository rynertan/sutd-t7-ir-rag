## Description
The present invention concerns a process for the pre paration , by mearls of dynamic vulcanization methods, of thermopl a st i c elastomeric ccmpositions, containing a plastomeric olefinic polymer and an at least partly reticulated elastomeric copolymer. The preparation of compositions based on thermoplastic polymers and vulcanized rubbers, by means of dynamic vulcanization, is quite known to the Prior Art and has been described in particular in U.S. Pat. nos. 3.758.643, 3.862.106, 3.037.954 and 2.806.558. According to said method, the vulcanization of the elastomeric component is effected in mixing or masticating phase with a plastomeric polymer in the molten state, by the action of cross linking agents which are usually of the conventional type, such as for instance peroxides, azo compounds, mixtures of sulphur with zinc oxide, substituted urea, thiocarbammates, etc. If in the thus treated mixture there is present a sufficient quantity of plastomeric polymer, the composition will, at the end of the vulcanization of the elastomeric component, retain a good processability characteristics under heat even with high percentages of vulcanized elastomer. According to French Patent N 2.408.632, polyolefinic plasto elastomeric compositions are obtained by means of dynamic vulcanization methods using as cross linking reticulating agent a halogenated phenolic resin or a non halogenated one, but combined associated with halogen donors in combination with a metal oxide activator . The compositions obtained through the dynamic vulcanization method, in common with all the compounds based on mixes of plastomeric polymers with reticulated elastomers, show, however, the drawback of being the more hardly processable or heat moldable formable under heat , the higher the percentage of reticulated elastomeric component present in them. Moreover, in the compositions thus obtained, the elastomeric component will easily show a dishomogeneity in its reticulation cross linkage , due to the difficulty of homogeneously dispersing in the composition the vulcanization agents, at the melting temperature of the plastomeric compound, before they become active at such a temperature. All these drawbacks do negatively influence the processability properties under heat of the compositions obtained. It has now been found by the Applicant that by dynamic vulcanization methods there may be obtained olefinic plastomeric compositions with EPDM rubbers, endowed, with respect to the compositions of the Prior Art, with an improved processability at the same reticulation degree of the rubbery component, using as a cross linking or reticulating agent a halogenated melamine comprised by the general for mull EMI3.1 wherein X chlorine or bromine Y chlorine, bromine or hydrogen atoms. Said reticulating agent may be used either alone by itself or in the presence of reticulation promoters, for instance polyvalent metal oxides i.e. zinc oxide, lead oxide, magnesium oxide, lead dioxide, lead sesquioxide, calcium oxide etc. , and or coagents normally used in the rubber industry e.g. guanidine, urea, glycols, mercaptanes, etc. . More particularly, in said reticulation system the halogenated melamine is present in quantities comprised between 0.2 and 20 parts by weight p.b.w. , but preferably comprised between 0.5 and 15 p.b.w. on 100 parts by weight of the elastomer component present in the composition to be prepared. The reticulation activators are present in a weight ratio, with respect to the halogenated melamine, comprised between 0.2 1 and 10 1, but preferably comprised between 1 1.3 and 5 1. For the purposes of this invention, as an elastomeric compound there is used a terpolymer of two alpha olefinic monomers with a conjugated or non conjugated dienic monomer, this latter being present in quantities comprised between 0.5 and 25Z by weight on the total weight of the elastomer. Examples of usable dienic monomers may be l.4 hexadiene 1.5 hexadiene 2 methyl 1.4 pentadiene 1,4,9 decatriene 1.5 cyclooctadiene l methyl 1.5 cyclooctadiene 1.4cycloheptadiene dicyclo pentadiene ethylidene norbornene butadiene the substitution derivatives from said monomers. Examples of alpha olefinic monomers may be ethylene propylene l butene 1 pentene l hexene 4 methyl l pentene 3.3 dimethyl l butene 3 methyl l hexene 2,4,4 trimethyl l pentene. Preferred are the ethylene propylene diene terpolymers containing from 20X to 50X b.w. of copolymerized propylene units. As olefinic plastomers there may be used polymers obtained by the polymerization of one or more mono olefines by means of either low or high pressure processes, such as for instance polyethylene, polypropylene, poly butene l, poly 4 methyl l pentene, poly l hexene, poly 5 methyl l hexene, poly 3 methyl l pentene. The relative proportions of the elastomeric component and of the plastomeric component inside the compositions, may vary over a wide range. Thus, for instance, there may be used from lOX to 70X by weight of plastomeric polymer and from 90X to 30X by weight of the elastomeric terpolymer on the mixture of the two. Preferably there are used from 70 to 40 b.w. of elastomeric terpolymer and from 30Z to 60Z by weight of plastomeric polymer, on said mixture. Thus, object of the present invention is a process for preparing plasto elastomeric compositions, said process consisting in subjecting to mastication a homogeneous mixture consisting of from 10X to 70X by weight of an olefinic polymer and of from 90Z to 30X b.w. of an unsaturated elastomeric terpolymer consisting of two alpha olefinic monomers and of a dienic monomer, in the presence of a halogenated melamine of the general formula EMI5.1 wherein X either a chlorine or a bromine atom Y a chlorine, bromine or hydrogen atom, present in quantities comprised between 0.2 and 20 Parts by weight on 100 p.b.w. of elastomeric terpolymer, at a temperature at which there occurs an at least partial reticulation of the elastomeric terpolymer. Preferably the homogeneous mixture, comprising the polymers and the halogenated melamine, and in general also the vulcanization accelerators and coadjuvants, is prepared by subjecting the mixture of the components to mastica tion, at a temperature lower than that at which the reticulation starts, in order to thus obtain a thorough and homogeneous mixing of the elastomer in the molten plastomeric component, in which the elastomer is present in the form of particles in a micron size, preferably comprised between 0.5 and 1 micron. The mastication and reticulation process may be carried out in an internal mixer or in an extruder, or in a system consisting of an internal mixer and a granulator.One may also operate in a plurality of apparatuses or machines arranged in sequence, where in the first machines there is carried out the thorough mixing and homogenization of the composition, and where in the successive machines is effected the reticulation, while operating throughout in the mixing or mastication step. In general, the temperature at which the reticulation or cross linking takes place is comprised between 140C and 250 C, but preferably is comprised between 1500C and 1800C. The duration of the mastication at the reticulation temperature depends on the degree of reticulation that one wishes to achieve in the elastomer. In general, the duration of the reticulation or cross netting stage is comprised between 30 sec. and 10 minutes. Preferably, the quantity of reticulated elastomer in the final composition is maintained between 90 and 1004 by weight on the total quantity of elastomer present. Mineral charges fillers , carbonblack, coloured pigments, plasticizers, stabilizing agents, extending oils, and in general all the classical ingredients of EPDM rubber based com positions, may be present in the mixture that is subjected to mastication and reticulation. The following examples are given for purely illustrative purposes, without any limiting intention.Example 1 Operating in an internal mixer, there were prepared plasto elastomeric compositions, by using the following polymeric components, in the quantities indicated on Table 1 EPDM elastomer DUTRAL TER 537 E2 by Dutral Comp. con sisting, in percent by weight, of 34X of propylene, 58.5 of ethylene and 7.5X b.w. of ethylidene norbornene, show ing a density 0.87 g cc a viscosity Mooney ML 121 C 50, and extended with 50Z by weight of paraffin oil polypropylene MOPLEN EP 1x35 AF by HIMONT It. with an M.I. 8.5 9 lO minutes . The above mentioned polymers are mixed together with zinc oxide and stearic acid, at a temperature of 155 C, until achieving the melting of the polypropylene. Thereupon there is admixed trichloromelamine and the mixing was then carried out at a temperature of 1600C for about 3 minutes. During reticulation the temperature equals 1600C with a peak of a few seconds at 1700C. The composition is then discharged from the mixer and subjected to the following determinations X of reticulated EPDM, by means of solubility tests in xylol at 125 C processability, by measuring the head pressure in the ex truder during the extrusion tests.These tests were carried out on a TR 15 type extruder, ope rating at a temperature of l90DC, with a spirlrleret of 2 mm and L D ratio 20 with an output rate of 10 g per mi nute . tension set at 75 , at 100 and at 200 of elongation, measured at 22 C and at 1000C, according to ASTM D 412, on a specimen punched off from an ASTM I injection molded testpiece. breaking load accord.
