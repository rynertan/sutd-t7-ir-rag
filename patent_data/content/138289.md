## Abstract
Method of decontaminating metal surfaces having radio active oxide deposits thereon which comprises preparing a decontamination solution having a pH of from 1.5 to 4 compris ing water, from 0.02 to 0.5 of a water soluble organic acid which has an equilibrium constant in a complex with ferric ion of at least about 10⁹ and which is capable of producing a pH of from 2 to 3 in water, and from 0.01 to 0.4 of a chelate in free acid form which has an equilibrium constant in a complex with ferric ion of from to 10¹⁵ to 10¹⁹ and which is soluble at at least 0.4 at 40 C in water having a pH of from 2 to 3. The decontam ination solution is heated to from 70 to 200 C and is placed in contact with the deposits on the metal surfaces until the level of radioactivity in the solution ceases to increase significantly. The metal surfaces are rinsed with water heated to from 70 to 200 C. An oxidizing solution is prepared comprising water, from 0.2 to 2.5 of an alkali metal permanganate, and from 0.2 to 2.5 of an alkali metal hydroxide. Preferably, the amount of the permanganate exceeds the amount of the hydroxide when less than a 3 solution is used. The oxidizing solution is heated to from 70 to 200 C, and is placed in contact with the deposits on the metal surfaces until the level of dichromate in the oxidizing solution ceases to increase significantly. The me tal surfaces are rinsed with water, radioactive ions are re moved from the decontamination solutions. the heated decon tamination solution is placed in contact with the deposits on the metal surfaces until the level of radioactivity in the solution ceases to increase signicantly, and the metal surfaces are rinsed with water. An apparatus is disclosed for decontaminating metal sur faces having a coating thereon which contains radioactive sub stances which comprises a decontamination tank 1 3 for holding the decontamination solution, means for circulating the decontamination solution between the decontamination tank an the metal surface, a cation exchange column 10 containing a cation exchange resin, means for circulating the decontamination solution between the decontamination tank and the cation exchange column 10 , an oxidizing tank for holding an oxidizing solution, means for circulating for oxidiz ing solution between the oxidizing tank and the metal surfaces, a water tank for holding water, means for circulating water be tween the water tank and the metal surfaces, a mixed anion cation exchange column 12, 13 containing a mixed anion cation exchange resin, and means for circulating the water be tween the water tank and mixed anion cationexchange col umn 12, 13 .
