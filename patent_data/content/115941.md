# Furnace delining apparatus.

## Abstract
A tool for breaking up a furnace lining is mounted on a carrier 21 pivotally mounted at 23 on an extension 20 of a jib member 19 which in turn is telescopically mounted in a sup porting jib member which is mounted about a horizontal pivot axis on the turntable of a supporting machine. To improve flexibility of access to all parts of the furnace the square section extension 20 can be rotated about its longitudinal axis between four positions defined by plates 37 projecting from four faces of the jib member 19. Turnbuckles 36 hold the extension 20 in position but when released and uncoupled by removal of pins 38 allow the extension to be axially shifted on a spigot projecting from the member 19 and rotated about the spigot to a fresh position.
