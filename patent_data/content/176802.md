# TAPE LOADING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A first tape guiding plate positioned close to a cylinder on a tape entrance side and a second tape guiding plate positioned closer to a supplying reel than the first tape guiding plate, are connected to a loading ring, and a connecting part of the second tape guiding plate to the loading ring is movable along the loading ring. The distance along the loading ring between the connecting parts of the second and first tape guiding plates to the loading ring is variable. The distance between the first and second tape guiding plates can be set sufficiently long during loading and sufficiently short during unloading.
