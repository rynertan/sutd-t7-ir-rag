# Control device for hydrostatic transmission.

## Abstract
A hydrostatic transmission such as for a vehicle comprises a variable speed prime mover 10 , a variable displacement pump 20 powered by the prime mover 10 , a fluid motor 30 powered by the variable displace ment pump 20 and, in accordance with the invention a control device 10 which senses the speed of the prime mover 10 and regulates the operation of a con trol cylinder 60 of the variable displacement pump 20 in accordance therewith so that the speed of the fluid motor 30 is not only respective to speed changes in the operation of the variable displacement pump 20 directly attributable to changes in speed of the prime mover 10 driving the variable displacement pump 20 but also responds to displacement changes in the vari able displacement pump 20 . A fixed pump 90 pow ered by the prime mover 10 develops a fluid flow pro portional to the speed of the prime mover 10 and this is converted into a corresponding mechanical signal by means of a series orifice 100 which develops a pressure differential proportional to the fluid flow of the fixed displacement pump 90 , which sets the op eration of a piston and cylinder arrangement 142 . The said mechanical signal determines the setting of a com pensator valve spool 156 which in dependance upon the position of an associated sleeve 160 determines the supply of high pressure fluid to the spool 176 of a servo arrangement having a control sleeve 182 which is mechanically linked with the displacement control element 40 of the variable displacement pump 20 and furthermore provides a camming surface for a cam follower 198 which in turn acts upon the compensator valve sleeve 160 . By this means, a mechanical feed back signal representative of the displacement of the variable displacement pump 20 is transmitted to the control means of the variable displacement pump 20 to maintain the pump displacement proportional to the speed of the prime mover 10 .
