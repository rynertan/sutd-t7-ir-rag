# Process and device for the preparation of a combustible gaseous mixture and power generating apparatus.

## Abstract
A system for the preparation of a combustible gaseous mixture from solid or liquid fuels, in which an artificial gravitational field is used, generated by a rotating cup shaped grate 1 for supporting a travelling bed of granular refractory material sand , the fuel lying upon said bed. A gaseous medium is supplied to the outside of the support grate 1 at a pressure higher than the one prevailing inside said grate and results in a velocity of said medium such, that only very small particles of the travelling bed are entrained, while the temperature of the combustible mixture remains in the order of 900 C.
