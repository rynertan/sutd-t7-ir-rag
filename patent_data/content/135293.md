# Room temperature vulcanizable polyorganosiloxane compositions containing ketoximosilanes and organotitanates.

## Abstract
A room temperature vulcanizable polyorganosiloxane composition which cures to products, such as silicone rubber, which do not soil easily are made from mixing silanol containing polyorganosiloxane, ketoxime silicon com pounds such as organotriketoximosilanes, and organotitan ates.
