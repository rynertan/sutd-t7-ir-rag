## Description
Lay out of a water feed pipe in correspondence with heat sources, in particular stove burners, for the recovery and exploitation of the heat emittedGuido BARAINI, Via Gest e Maria 7, NaplesThis invention concerns the lay out of a water feed pipe in correspondence with heat sources, in particular stove burners, for the recovery and exploitation of the heat emitted and for its use in providing hot water to collector reservoirs like water heaters and the like.Energy savings in general is a current theme. In domestic use, saving electrical energy is particularly desirable both in terms of its use and its constantly increasing cost, as well as in terms of the difficulty of providing the certain potential needed for the various appliances every family needs.The appliances which most affect the family budget include water heaters, washing machines and dishwashers.All of these appliances require hot water, at predetermined temperatures. In addition, each family requires hot running water in both kitchen and bathroom Currently each of the above appliances uses autonomous devices to heat water, devices which are powered by electricity.This involves a not insignificant consumption of electrical energy which translates into a heavy economic ex pense.The aim of the present invention is to recover the calories generated by the flame of a gas stove or other heat source which would otherwise be lost during operation of the stove, using said calories to heat water to send to a single collector reservoir to supply all the domestic needs and in this way completely eliminating the need to use electrical resistance to heat the water for each use.The invention achieves this aim by passing a pipe, preferably copper, fed with cold water, around each of the heat sources of a gas, electric, etc. stove and by then sending said water to a common collector reservoir to supply several domestic uses.The fundamental concept of the invention thus resides in the recovery of these calories which would otherwise be lost during the operation of stoves, using said calories to generate hot water for domestic uses.With particular reference to gas stoves, the invention provides for a precise sizing both of the distance between the flame and the edge of the pipe surrounding it and of the height of the pipe with respect to the plane of the flame. The dimensions of both are based on the average flame adjustment low, medium, high . These dimensions are such that, with low flame, the points of the flame lap the pipe, and with medium to high flame, the final section of the flame, starting from the elbow it forms, tangentially laps the pipe from the inside. A precise sizing such as described allows, according to the invention, maximum exploitation of the calories emitted by the flame by the water circulating in the pipe. In this way, operation for 1.5 hours of a single gas burner can supply from 80 to 100 liters of water at 800C.The object of the invention will be described below in more detail with reference to preferred embodiments shown in an exemplificative and non limiting way in the attached drawings. The figures show figure 1, a view from above of a gas stove top with four burners with the water feed pipe arranged around them figure 2, a view from the top of the fixing of the pipe around a burner figure 3, a front view analogous to that of figure 2 figure 4, a view from the top of the oven burner with the water pipe arranged around it figure 5, a view from the top of a variant of figure 1 with the water pipe placed inside a siutable support with the burner in the center, but with said pipe uncovered above figure 6, a front view of figure 5, where the inlet and outlet of the flow through the pipe can be seen figure 7, a cross section according to line VII VII of figure 5 figure 8, a view from the top of another variant in which the water pipe is drawn in a support prepared by die casting figure 9, a section according to line IX IX of figure 8 figure 10, a partially sectioned view from the top of an electrical resistance plate with the water pipe incorporated in it figure 11, a cross section of figure 10 figure 12, a prospective view of three types of collector reservoirs pressure vessel, drop and thermostatic valve figure 13, a prospective view of a stove with the collector reservoir incorporated.Figure 1 shows the lay out of a pipe 1 around four burners of a gas stove. A pressure and flow regulator 2 is provided at the inlet. Pipe 1 is placed around a first burner with water in circulation in the direction of the arrow. The dashed line with the dashed arrows next to it indicates the passage of the pipe to the second burner around which it is arranged, to then pass dashed line to the third burner and then the fourth. The pipe, preferably in copper, must be very narrow to facilitate absorption of calories from the flame by the circulating flow. The pipe is placed, as described below, at a certain height with respect to the plane of the flame and at a certain distance, generally 1 cm, from the stove burner.Figures 2 and 3 show better the fixing of the pipe in its track around the flame. A first clamp 3 is fixed to the stove top and its position can be adjusted by means of a slot on which a screw 6 is tightened. This allows the pipe to be centered around the burner. A second clamp 4 serves for anchorage to screw 5, also sliding inside a slot, to adjust the height of the pipe. The distance of the pipe from the flame on the horizontal plane having previously been determined when the pipe was centered, operating on screws 5 and 6 allows said pipe to be placed with respect to the burner F in order that the calories emitted be optimally exploited by the water in circulation in the pipe.At the outlet of the fourth burner F of figure 1, the pipe is passed around the oven burner, as shown in figure 4. The outlet Is then connected with a collector reservoir which may be of various types pressure, drop, or thermostatic valve.As a variant to the first embodiment of figure i, the invention proposes a support 7 in which the pipe 1 is encased. The cap of the burner F of a stove is removed and replaced with support 7, shown more clearly in fig ure 6 with the inlet and outlet of the water flow.Figure 7 shows the placement of pipe i in distAnce and height from burner F. The gas enters through pipe 10, and burns with flame 9 which laps with its elbow the periphery of support 7 in contact with the pipe 1 encased in peripheral recess 11. Openings 8 are provided for removal of any water which bubbles out of the pan.Figure 8 shows another variant of the embodiment of figure 1. In this embodiment, support 12, prepared by die casting of suitable metal material, has Pipe 1 incorporated. Support 12 can also readily replace the cap of ner F. In this case as well, the gas enters throuqh pipe 10, and burns with flame 9 which laps with its elbow the periphery of support 12, where said support makes up the wall of the pipe 1 figure 9 . It is important to note that in the embodiment of figures 7 and 8, compressing the flame 9, by means of suitable adjustment in distance and height with respect to burner F, working in a direction more oriented to the top, one achieves a considerable savings in gas beyond the heating of pipe 1. This is due to the greater concentration of the body of the flame in height, with recovery of the part which would otherwise be dispersed radially.Figure 10 shows an electric plate 14 with incorporated resistances R and with a tube 1 incorporated peripherically and concentrically to said resistances. The heat is displaced from the center toward the periphery, and is concentrated along the pipe 1 which follows the same path as pipe 1 in figure 1. Figure 12 shows some types of collector reservoirs pressure, drop, thermostatic valve to be used for the invention.Figure 13 shows a stove with a space provided to place a collector reservoir.For the ends of the invention, it is preferable to use a reservoir with a thermostatic valve so as to aiv7ays have hot water which, if mixed, gives an optimal yield.In fact, the thermostatic valve, adjusted for example o to 80 C, allows only hot water to enter the reservoir, while a safety valve set at a determined temperature, ensures expulsion of the water to the discharge tube of the apparatus.The described arrangement of a water supply tube may of course be applied to hotel and restaurant stoves as well, or also to larger sized heat sources. In this case, much large quantities of hot water are available to be used for hotels, communities, heating, etc. The advantages achieved with this invention seem evident on the basis of what has been described and illustrated.The calories emitted by the burners of domestic stoves, which would be dispersed, are recovered and utilized to prepare hot water for all domestic uses, eliminating the consumption of electrical resistances, with resulting savings of energy and money in addition, a considerable sav ings in gas is achieved in the operation of the stove itself.The object of the invention has been described and illustrated with reference to preferred embodiments. Of course modifications are possible in arrangement, dimensions and proportions without going beyond the bounds of the invention.
