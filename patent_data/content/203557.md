# Process for the preparation of 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl 1 bromoethyl ketone and its derivatives.

## Abstract
A process is described for the preparation of 6 me thoxy 2 naphthyl 1 bromoethyl ketone or ketals thereof I , by selective debromination of 5 bromo 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl 1 bromoethyl ketone or ketals thereof III by means of a bromine acceptor in the presence of an acid and of an inert organic solvent.
