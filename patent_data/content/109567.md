# Accelerated instruction mapping external to source and target instruction streams for near realtime injection into the latter.

## Abstract
If a predetermined field within a source instruction indexes and accesses a body of control informa tion from memory, and if control information designates the field to field register to register mapping, then a skeleton target instruction can be filled in by either selectively copying the fields of the source instruction or otherwise computing same. If the mapping is executed by an interposed indepen dent processor then overlapping of such conversion en hances throughput, the independent processor converting multifield instructions for a CPU of a first kind to multifield instuctions for a CPU of a second kind without disrupting the logical flow or execution of either source or target instruction streams.
