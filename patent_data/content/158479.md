# Method for producing an optical recording medium by a chalcogenide suboxide.

## Abstract
Chalcogenide suboxide, particularly tellurium oxides TeOx, arc possible to reversibly change optical characteris tics by changing power of irradiating light to repeat record ing and erasure. If the TeOx is X 1, high sensitivity is obtained but the characteristic of film is greatly deteriorated due to the environment. In accordance with this invention there is proposed a film which can be used as an optical recording medium having a high sensitivity and a high stability under the conditions that a partial pressure of oxygen is in the range from 1 x 10 ⁴ 9 x 10 ³ Torr and a high frequency power for forming a plasma in the range of 50 500W and wherein the TeOx film is formed by metal tellurium vapor passing through a plasma of oxygen gas.
