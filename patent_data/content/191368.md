## Description
SKI BOOT STRUCTURE WITH A EBE SCURING DEYICEw This invention relates to a ski boot structure with a heel securing device. As is known, ski boots, and particularly rear entrance ski boots, require that the heel be held securely when the boot is in its closed position. To accomplish this, it is current practice to provide the inner shoe of rear entrance ski boots with a small flap, which is located in the rear region of the inner shoe such that, in the closing movement of the rear quarter, the two rear edges of the shoe are brought together, thereby practically filling the empty region of the foot ankle of the user with the small flap itself and securing, in consequence, the heel. That embodiment, while being convenient from a functional standpoint, has shown to be highly expensive, because the small flap attached to the inner shoe is in general a padded item to be made separately from the shoe and then sewn to the inner shoe. It is the aim of this invention to overcome the above described problem by providing a ski boot which has such means of securing the heel that involve no later attachment to the boot component parts. Within the above aim, it is a particular object of the invention to provide a ski boot which affords a firm hold on the foot, at the heel region thereof, without forcing the user to perform any particular adjustments. Another object of this invention is to provide a ski boot which, by virtue. of its peculiar constructional features, can give full assurance of being reliable and safe to use. A not least object of this invention is to provide a ski boot, wherein the making of the heel securing means has no practical effect on the end product cost. The above aim, and these and other objects to become apparent hereinafter, are all achieved by a ski boot structure with a heel securing device, according to the invention, comprising a shell having at least one quarter associated therewith, and characterized in that it comprises, at the free rear edge of said shell, a small flap extending upwards and being engageable with the user s foot substantially at ankle level. Further features and advantages will be more clearly apparent from the following detailed description of a ski boot structure with a heel securing device, as shown by way of illustration and not of limitation in the accompanying drawing, where Figure 1 shows diagramatically a rear view of the boot shell Figure 2 is a sectional view of the boot, taken on a vertical plane, illustrating the rear portion of the boot and Figure 3 shows a cross section taken substantially through the region occupied by the quarters. With reference to the cited drawing figures, a ski boot according to the invention comprises a shell, indicated at 1, which has substantially a traditional configuration and is, preferably, of the rear entrance type. Attached to the shell 1 as by hinge connection, in a manner known per se, are the front quarter 2 and rear quarter 3. Inside the boot, the usual soft inner shoe 4 is located which, with rear entrance boots, has.its rear portion preferably open to facilitate introduction and withdrawal of the foot into out of the boot. The peculiar aspect of the invention is that, at the free rear edge 5 of the shell 2, there is provided a small flap 10 which is formed integrally during the shell molding process. The flap 10 has a substantially bucket like configuration with side extensions 11 which overlap at least in part the rear edges of the shoe 4. The flap 10 is positioned substantially level with ankle of the user s foot, and is arranged such that it is urged by the rear quarter, during the boot closing phase, to practically fill the empty area at the ankle, thereby securing the heel inside the boot. The flap 10 is connected to the cited free rear edge 5 by a narrow width section 12 which affords easy elastic flexing of the flap 10, both during the boot utilization phase and during shake out of the former from the shell making mold. As shown diagramatically particularly in Figure 2, with the boot in the closed position, the flap 10 is pushed against the inner shoe to provide a comfortable and reliable securement of the ankle, and consequently, of the foot heel inside the boot. It may be appreciated from the foregoing description that the invention fully achieves its objects, and in particular the fact should be empha sized that the anatomical configuration assumed by the flap allows the edges or flap of the soft inner shoe to be at least partly wrapped around, urging it against the user s foot to effect a stable securement. Furthermore, the integral construction of that flap with the shell greatly simplifies all the boot manufacturing steps, it being unnecessary to attach an additional element as is done instead at present in applying that flap to the inner shoe. In practicing the invention, the materials used, so long as compatible with the specific application, and the dimensions and contingent shapes, may be any suitable ones to meet individual requirements.
