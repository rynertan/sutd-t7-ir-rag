# WHEEL FOR VEHICLE.

## Abstract
A vehicle wheel which is equipped with a tire enables the vehicle to remain balanced even when the internal pressure of the tire drops due to a puncture or other ac cident, thereby allowing the vehicle to continue running. An annular barrel 1 equipped on both sides thereof with rims 2 for securing the bead portions of a tire is provided around its outer peripheral central part with an annular projection 4 of a diameter large enough to project beyond the outer ends of the rims 2 . The annular projection 4 is further provided with at least one groove 5 crossing the projection 4 . The groove 5 can be employed for facilitat ing the mounting of the tire onto the wheel.

## Description
S P E C 1 F I C A T I O N WHEEL FOR VEHICLESTechnical Field This invention relates to improvements in a wheel for vehicles having a tire attached thereto when used. Background The wheels of conventional vehicles such as automobiles and autobicycles are in the form of an annulus of substantially U shaped cross section recessed in the middle.Thus, if the tire attached in position is pierced with a hole, the compressed air in the tire gushes out and the tire deforms, often making it impossible for the car to travel. If the wheel is left to rotate with its tire punctured, the weight of the vehicle bears down on the projecting rims on the opposite sides of the wheel, causing said rims to act as cutters to cut the tire. Damage to a tire of a car running at high speed is very dangerous, putting the vehicle out of balance and often turning it over. The object of this invention is to eliminate such drawbacks and to provide a wheel capable of allowing the vehicle, even if the tire is damaged during running, to maintain its balance to continue traveling. Disclosure of the Invention The wheel according to the invention comprises an annular barrel portion with rims at the opposite sides. An annular projection having a diameter greater than that of flanges at the front ends of the rims is formed arround the outer peripheral central portion of the annular barrel portion, and at least one groove is formed in the annular projection to cut across the projection. The shape of the annular projection differs with the type and size of the vehicle and the width of the wheel and is not limited to inverted U shape, T shape, etc., but it is preferable that the portion projecting beyond the flanges on the front ends of the rims have a substantially curved surface. The annular projection and the annular barrel may be formed as a unit or separate parts. However it is preferred that at least the front end of the annular projection is formed of a plastic or rubber molding. Further, the annular projection may be formed into a hollow shape and attached to the annular barrel. In the case where the annular projection is hollow, one or more air holes may be formed in the annular projection so that air is introduced into the annular projection when compressed air is introduced into the tire.In this case, the air holes may be designed on the principle of the flute so that a sound is produced as the compressed air slowly flows out, thus notifying the driver of the air flowing out in the earlier stages of the leakage. The shape and size of the groove formed in the annular projection differ with the shape etc. of the projection and is not particularly limited, but it is preferable that the groove cuts obliquely across the projection and that the upper portion is narrower and the lower portion is wider. The depth of the groove should naturally extend down to the level of the flanges or therebelow, but it is preferable that the higher the annular projection, the deeper the groove and particularly that the depth be at least about twice the height of the portion of the annular projection projecting beyond the flanges. Such wheel according to the invention has on the annular barrel the proJection p roJecting beyond the flanges at the front ends of the rims adapted to have a tire mounted thereon. However, the tire can be easily mounted on the wheel through the groove formed across the projection. Further, once the the tire is mounted on the wheel, even if the tire is pierced with ahole and the air between the tire and the wheel gushes out, the tire is not removed from the wheel with the projection. Thus in the case where the tire is damaged, the inner side of the tread of the tire is held on the surface of the projection, so that there is no possibility of the tire being cut by the rims of the wheEl or the vehicle becoming extremely unbalanced. The vehicle can be continuously travelled at low speed until it is parked in a safe place.Thus in the wheel according to the invention, the projection acts as a quasi tire, thereby lessening the shock due to the damage to the tire.

Fig. 7 is a sectional view showing different examples of annular projections in the invention. Fig. 8 is asectionalview of an another wheel according to the invention. Best Mode of Carrying Out the Invention The embodiments of the invention will be described according to the drawings. The wheel shown in Fig. 1 comprises a metal annular barrel portion 1 with rims 2 at the opposite sides, on the central portion of which a metal annular projection 4 is attached. The annular projection 4 has air holes 6 and a groove 5 obliquely across the annular projection 4 . The groove 5 is narrower in the upper portion and wider in the lower portion as shown in Fig. 3. The wheel is used in the state of mounting a tire 7 on the flanges 3 of rims 2 as shown in Fig. 2. In spite of that the diameter of the beads 8 of the tire 7 is smaller than that of the annular projection 4 , the tire 7 is easily and stably mounted on the wheel. That is, the tire 7 can be mounted by thrusting the bead portion 8 and side portion 9 of the tire 7 into the barrel portion 1 from one rim 2 through the groove 5 to the other rim 2 across the projection 4 . In the embodiment as shown in Fig. 4 to Fig. 6, a plastic or rubber molding leo is attached to the front end of the projection 4 . The plastic or rubber molding 10 may be made of natural rubber, any of the various synthetic rubbers or synthetic resins, e.g., NBR, SBR, polystyrene, polyurethane, or polypropylene, or a combination thereof, and the molding 10 may be molded in advance division molded in two or more parts depending upon the shape and then attached to the annular barrel l or to a base ill for the annular projection 4 or it may be directly molded on the annular barrel 1 or the base for the annular projection 4 . In the former case, the attachment of the molding leo itself may be made by making use of such attaching means as bolts or adhesive agents. The plastic or rubber molding 10 is intended to lessen a shock which occurs when the tire is damaged, and since it has a suitable degree of elasticity, it effectively prevents d,isplacement of the tire 7 when punctured, thus greately increasing the distance the car travels with the tire 7 punctured. Further, the presence of the plastic or rubber molding leo makes it possible to make the height of the projection 4 greater than when the annular projection 4 is made entirely of metal. This makes it possible to detect abnormalities of the tire 7 earlier and allows the car to travel with the diameter of the tire 7 not greately differing from that of the other tires 7 . The plastic or rubber molding 10 may be such that it forms the whole of the annular projection 4 , as shown in Fig. 7A and B or it may be formed on the base 11 for the annular projection 4 , as shown in Fig. 7C, D and F. In the latter case, the base 11 may be integral with the annular barrel 01 or separate therefrom, but it is preferable that it is integral therewith. Further, it is preferable that the plastic or rubber molding 10 be a cellular molding or foam, from the standpoint of weight and cushioning. Finally, in the invention, it is preferable that the valley 12 of the annular barrel 1 be deeper than in the case of ordinary wheels, and it is necessary for efficient mounting of the tire 7 that the distance from the valley 12 to the opposite top 13 of the annular projection 4 be less than the diameter of the flanges 3 of the rims 2 . However, the depth of the valley 12 may be different on the opposite sides of the annular projection 4 , as shown in Fig. 8, and in this case, at least one side should be of the desired depth. Industrial Applicability Such wheel of the invention is useful for trucks, automobiles, autobicycles, bicycles, airplanes and other vehicles having tires attached thereto.
