# Floppy disc drives.

## Abstract
For centering and clamping a disc like recording medium on the spindle of a floppy disk drive, there is an expandible collet 21 comprising a plurality of flexible fingers 55 which have generally tangentially extending arcuately profile ribs for clamping the disk against the spindle. Due to the flexibility of the fingers 55 , the ribs have substantially constant, line like footprint, which enables them to apply a predetermined, essentially constant, normal clamping press ure to the recording medium, even if the collet is slightly tilted with respect to the spindle, or if the mating surfaces of the collet 21 and spindle are not absolutely parallel or perfectly flat.
