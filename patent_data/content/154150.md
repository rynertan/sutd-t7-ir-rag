The cosmetic is prepared by first mixing the cosmetic powder and the alkyl phosphate dissolved in an organic solvent under heating conditions. Subsequently, the solvent is distilled off to form an alkyl phosphate coating on the indivisual particles. The coated particles are mixed with other cosmetic ingredients.
