# Method and apparatus for forming an optical waveguide preform and an optical waveguide.

## Abstract
A substantially continuous method of and apparatus for forming an article suitable for an optical waveguide preform wherein the starting member is continuously removed is dis closed. The preform 26 is formed by providing a starting member or bait 10 and applying the particulate material 20 to the exterior surface of the starting member 10 to form a coating thereon. The coating is longitudinally translated while simultaneously additional particulate material is applied to the coating to form a preform body 26 with the preform body thereafter being longitudinally translated. While longitudi nally translated the preform body 26 and applying additional particulate material to the end thereof, the starting member 10 is continuously removed from the preform body 26 leaving a longitudinal aperture 30 remaining in the preform body 26 . The particulate material may be applied by one or more burners 18,42 the output of which may be controlled to provide a predetermined desired cross sectional composition variation of the resulting preform body. The so formed pre formed body may thereafter be suitably heated, consolidated, and drawn into an optical waveguide.
