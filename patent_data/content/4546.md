# Beryllium containing iron boron glassy magnetic alloys.

## Abstract
Introduction of beryllium into iron boron base glassy alloys improves the thermal stability while substantially retaining the saturation moment of the base alloy. The alloys of the invention consist essentially of about 10 to 18 atom percent boron, about 2 to 10 atom percent beryllium and about 72 to 80 atom percent iron plus incidental impurities.
