# Communications circuit line protector and method of making the same.

## Abstract
A line protector for a communications circuit provides a gas tube surge voltage arrester 18 for primary surge protec tion and a back up air gap arrester 30, 32 for secondary protection in the event of venting of the gas tube. The gas tube is housed in a metallic tubular element 27 that forms one electrode 30 at the air gap 44, 46 , the other electrode at the air gap be provided by the rim 32 of one of the gas tube electrodes. The tubular element is initially formed of circular cross section, then deformed to an oval cross section to be dimensioned to provide engagements 40, 42 across the minor diameter of the oval with the gas tube when the latter is telescoped therewith. The fit provided by the aforesaid engagement establishes the correct air gap width.
