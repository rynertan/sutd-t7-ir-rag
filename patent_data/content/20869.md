# A Y bar corner for a magnetic bubble domain loop.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a magnetic bubble domain storage loop including a Y bar corner element 20A and canted I bars 22A, 22B positioned between the Y bar corner element 20A and propagation elements 24A, 24B . The ends of the arm of the Y bar corner element 20A are positioned adjacent the apex portions 27, 25 of the canted I bars 22A, 22B . The distance between the ends of the arms of the Y bar 20A is larger than the distance between the opposing ends of the two canted I bars 22A, 22B . With this corner a bubble propagates in either direction along a path from the propagation element to the end of the canted I bar and then to the apex portion of the canted I bar and from there across to the end of the arm of the Y bar.
