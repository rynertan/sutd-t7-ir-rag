# Thermosetting coating composition.

## Abstract
A thermosetting coating composition which may have nonvolatiie solids content as high as 60 or greater and which may be employed as an automotive topcoat. The composi tion, exclusive of pigments, solvent, reactive and non reactive diluents and other non reactive components, consists essen tially of A A binder composition consisting essentially of 1 Between about 30 and about 75 weight percent of one or more low viscosity resins selected from hyd roxy functional acrylic polymers, hydroxy functional polyethers and hydroxy functional polyesters, each of which i is substantially soluble in the solvent of the composition and ii has a number average molecular weight of between about 1000 and about 2500 and 2 Between about 70 and about 25 weight percent of one or more crosslinked dispersion polymers each of which is substantiaily insoluble in the solvent of the composition and B An amino crosslinking agent in an amount of between about 5 and about 40 parts per 100 parts of said binder composition. The crosslinked dispersion polymer is prepared by free radical polymerization of 0.5 to 3.5 weight percent of di ,tri or tetravinyl monomers and 99.5 to 96.5 weight percent of at least one other copolymerizable monoethylenically unsaturated monomer, in the present of a i hydrocarbon dispers ing liquid which is a solvent for the polymerizable monomer, but a non solvent for the resulting cross linked polymer, and ii polymeric dispersion stabilizer which is solvated by said dispersing liquid and associ eted with said crosslinked polymer so as to maintain a separation between particles thereof, thereby inhibit ing coagulation of said particles, wherein polymeriza tion is carried out at elevated temperature such that the dispersion polymer first forms and then is cross linked.
