## Description
This invention relates to a new monoclonal antibody produced by a hybridoma cell line. More particularly, it relates to a new monoclonal protein C antibody produced by a hybridoma cell line, to a process for its preparation by a hybridoma cell line, to a hybridoma cell line secreting said antibody, to a process for purifying protein C using said antibody, to a enzyme linked immunosorbent assay hereinafter referred to ELISA of protein C and radioimmunoassay hereinafter referred to RIA of protein C. In the state of art, preparation and use of polyclonal antibodies has been disclosed in EP A 0 118 256 and The New England Journal of Medicine, Vol.309, pages 340 to 344 1984 . EP A 0 118 256 discloses an immunosorbent process of recovering a selected Vitamin K dependent protein wherein the immunosorbent includes a monoclonal antibody to said protein. From The New England Journal of Medicine, Vol.309, pages 340 to 344 1984 , an immunological assay for protein C using the protein C anti protein C polyclonal antibody specifities is known. However, methods for the preparation of monoclonal anti protein C antibody have not been disclosed. Therefore, the present invention is directed to a monoclonal anti protein C antibody, prepared by a method comprising the following steps The monoclonal anti protein C antibody of this invention is prepared from cell culture of a mammalian hybridoma cell line produced by fusing a mammalian spleen cell and a mammalian myeloma cell in which the spleen cell is taken from the mammal immunized with protein C originated in mammal. Fusion between a spleen cell and a myeloma cell is achieved by bringing them into contact in the presence of a fusion promoter e.g. polyethyleneglycol . A small percentage of spleen cells and myeloma cells are fused to produce hybridoma. Further, thus obtained hybridomas secrete various antibodies according to a variety of fused spleen cells. But, it is possible to isolate a hybridoma secreting desired antibody from thus obtained hybridomas by cloning. Thus obtained and cloned hybridoma can be grown in a nutrient medium or in a peritoneal cavity of a mammal, and the produced antibody can be purified from culture supernatant, or ascitic fluid or serum of the mammal in a conventional manner which are generally employed in the isolation and purification of protein from natural or artificial sources. As such a manner, there are exemplified, an isolation and purification method such as centrifugation, dialysis, precipitation with ammonium sulfate, column chromatography using DEAE cellulose, gel filtration, affinity column chromatography and lyophilization. The advantage of this technique is that it provides a source of specific anti protein C antibody directed against only a certain determinant and uncontaminated by antibodies raised by an antigenic impurities contained in the protein C preparation used. Another advantage of the technique is that substantial quantities of desired anti protein C antibody may easily be provided. Thus obtained monoclonal anti protein C antibody of this invention have a binding ability to protein C, and is adoptable as an immunoadsorbent in an immunoadsorption purification process for protein C. More particularly, a monoclonal anti protein C antibody of this invention can be bound to polysaccharide by reacting it with an activated polysaccharide e.g. CNBr activated Sepharose 4B made by Pharmacia Fine Chemicals AB in a conventional manner. The invention is described by the following experimental details. Protein C was purified from human plasma, showing single band electrophoretically. Thirty µg of the protein C solution was administered to each of 6 female BALB c mice by intraperitoneal injection together with 100 µl of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine made by the Institute of Microbiology of Osaka University 2 x 10¹⁰ The spleen cells prepared by teasing spleens with forceps were fused with mouse myeloma cells P3 X63 Ag8 U1 by the method of Köhler and Milstein c.f. Nature , Namely, the spleen cells were suspended in Dulbecco s modified Eagle s minimum essential medium hereinafter referred to D MEM . The erythrocytes in the suspension were destroyed by treating with a mixture of 0.83 ammonium chloride solution 9 volume and 0.17 M tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane hydrochloric acid buffer solution pH 7.65, 1 volume at 4 C for 5 minutes and removed off by centrifugation. The mouse myeloma cells which were cultured in D MEM supplemented with 15 fetal bovine serum and spleen cells were washed several times with D MEM. To the suspension of the mouse myeloma cells 4 x 10⁷ cells was added the suspension of the spleen cells 2 x 10⁸ cells . The mixture was well mixed in 50 ml plastic tube Corning 50 ml centrifuge tube, made by Corning Glass Works . The medium was removed off by centrifugation. The cells were warmed in a water bath to 37 C. To the cells was gradually added 45 polyethyleneglycol made by Sigma average molecular weight was 4,000 solution 1 ml in the course of one minute, while shaking. The mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 7 minutes. The cell fusion reaction was stopped by adding 15 ml of D MEM drop by drop to the reaction mixture in the course of 5 minutes. After a large volume of D MEM was added to the mixture, the mixture was centrifuged to remove supernatant. To the residue was added complete medium comprising D MEM supplemented with 15 fetal bovine serum made by Centaurus, Lot 757 , 2 mM glutamine, 2 x 10 ⁵ M 2 mercaptoethanol, 100 µg ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 U ml penicillin G, 80 µg ml gentamicin sulfate and 0.25 µg ml Fungizone Amphotericin B, GIBCO Lab. hereinafter referred to CM . After the mixture was slightly mixed, 1 ml of the resultant fused cell suspensions was distributed in each well of ten 24 well plates Nunc at a ratio of 1 x 10⁶ spleen cells per well. One day after the incubation at 37 C in 5 carbon dioxide atmosphere, 1 ml of CM containing aminopterine 4 x 10 ⁷ M , thymidine 1.6 x 10 ⁵ M and hypoxanthine 1 x 10 ⁴ M HAT medium was added to each well. After one day, a half volume of the medium in each well was removed by suction and the HAT medium was added to each well every second or third day. Fourteen days after the cell fusion, growth of hybrid cells was observed in almost all wells. To each well of 96 well plates made by Cooke, M 174, cup U rigid immulon was added 100 µl of 50 µg ml protein C solution or bovine serum albumin solution, and the plates were incubated at 4 C overnight for the well to be coated with protein C. Then, a solution of bovine serum albumin 20 µl ml was added to block well completely. To each well 100 µl of the above obtained supernatant of the hybridoma culture was added and was incubated at 37 C for 90 minutes. After washed with phosphate buffered saline hereinafter rerferred to PBS 3 times, 100 l of affinity chromatography purified, ¹²⁵I labelled goat anti mouse IgG F ab ₂ solution 10,000 cpm, specific activity 1 Ci µg IgG was added thereto and was incubated at 37 C 1 hour. The radioactivity of each well was determined by a gamma scintillation counter. Cultures showing binding activity to protein C, not to bovine serum albumin, were selected as culture producing anti human protein C antibody. Anti protein C activity was detected in 1 culture of 29 cultures assayed in Experiment 1 and 51 cultures of 226 cultures assayed in Experiment 2. Twenty hybridoma cell cultures which showed high binding activity to protein C were cloned by limiting dilution in 96 well flat bottomed micro test plate made by NUNC using BALB c mouse thymocytes as feeder layer 5 x 10⁶ cells ml . The above obtained hybridoma was transplanted intraperitoneally to a BALB c mouse which had been adminstered with tetramethylpentadecane 1 week earlier. After about 1 week, ascites was taken from peritoneal cavity of the mouse, from which monoclonal anti protein C antibody was isolated by 50 saturated ammononium sulfate solution. Namely, after removing hybridoma cells from the ascitic fluid by centrifugation, to the supernatant was gradually added ammonium sulfate at a final concentration of 50 saturation while stirring. The mixture was stirred under ice cooling for 30 minutes and allowed to stand for 60 minutes. After centrifuging the mixture, resultant residue was dissolved in a small volume of 20 mM tris hydroxymethyl aminoethane hydrochloric acid 20 mM NaCl buffer pH 7.9 , was dialyzed against the same buffer and was subjected to a column chromatography on DEAE cellulose DE52, made by Whatman Chemical Separation Ltd. equilibrated with the same buffer. Elution of the monoclonal antibody was carried out with a linear gradient of 20 mM tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane hydrochloric acid 20 mM NaCl buffer pH 7.9 and 40 mM tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane hydrochloric acid 0.5 M NaCl buffer pH 7.9 . Thus obtained eluate was used as an immunoadsorbent in a purification process for protein C, particulars of which are described in Example 2 ii , and as antibodies of ELISA for human protein C, particulars of which are described in Example 2 iii . Molecular weight of antibody was determined by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Culture supernatant were added with equal volume of saturated ammonium sulfate solution and allowed to stand for 1 hour on ice. The precipitates obtained by centrifugation were dissolved in one tenth volume of PBS. Identification of immunoglobulin of antibodies thus obtained was conducted by the method of Ouchterlony s double immunodiffusion method. Polyclonal goat antibodies made by Miles were used to characterize each subclass of monoclonal antibodies. Thus obtained monoclonal anti protein C antibodies are as follows. CNBr activated Sepharose 4B 0.7 g was washed with 1 mM hydrogen chloride and coupling buffer containing 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate pH 8.3 and 0.5 M sodium chloride, successively, to prepare a solution of CNBr activated Sephrose 4B in coupling buffer 3 ml . To 1 ml of the solution was added 3 ml of coupling buffer solution of monoclonal anti human protein C antibody 3 15 7 3.7 mg, protein prepared in Example 1, which had been prepared by dialysis. The resultant mixture was allowed to shake at room temperature for 2 hours. After washing the mixture by 5 to 7 ml of PBS on G3 glass filter, 1 M ethanolamine HCl 4 ml, pH 8.0 was added thereto and was allowed to shake at a room temperature for 2 hours to block remaining active site. After blocking, the resultant antibody coupled Sepharose 4B solution was washed with a solution of 0.1 M acetate buffer pH 4.0 containing 0.5 M sodium chloride and coupling buffer mentioned above, successively three times and was equilibrated with 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 containing 0.5 sodium chloride after washing 20 ml of PBS containing 0.1 bovine serum albumin. Thus obtained CNBr activated Sepharose 4B coupled monoclonal anti protein C antibody hereinafter referred to antibody coupled Sepharose 4B, specifically Column 3 15 7, was used for affinity column chromatography. Antibody coupled Sepharose 4B 0.5 ml was packed to a column which was equilibrated with 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 containing 0.5 M sodium chloride. Crude human protein C applied for affinity chromatography was prepared as followed. To 25 ml of human plasma from blood of 5 healthy men was added 2 ml of 1 M BaCl₂ in the presence of benzamidine. Precipitate was collected by centrifugation, following washing with 0.15 M sodium chloride solution containing 5 mM benzamidine. The precipitate is dissolved in 0.25 M EDTA and 5 mM benzamidine solution. The protein solution obtained by centrifugation is dialyzed against PBS. The solution containing crude human protein C was loaded on the column, washed with PBS, eluted with 3M potassium thiocyanate solution. Protein C was assayed by ELISA described later. The results are shown in the following Table 1. Anti human protein C monoclonal antibody was purified as described above. Conjugation of horse radish peroxidase hereinafter referred to POD type IV, made by Sigma to monoclonal antibody was performed as described by Nakane and Kawaoi Nakane, R. K. and A. Kawaoi, J. Histochem. Cytochem. The results are shown in the following Table 2. This results show that the use of same antibody for enzyme conjugation and coating is impossible because of the competition on the certain determinant. This means that applicable combination of antibodies comprise antibodies directed to different determinant. These antibodies are classified as follows. Combination of monoclonal antibodies for best sensitive assay is 2 105 6 for coating and 3 54 5 for enzyme conjugation. ELISA with this combination was able to detect 1 100 ng ml of purified protein C. Further, ELISA with this combination was possible to detect protein C in human plasma after dilution of 80 to 2,560 fold. The concentration of protein C in human plasma determined in this ELISA was 4.96 µg ml. Protein C is activated by thrombin to protein Ca which acts as a serine protease to activated Factor V or synthetic substrate. Protein C activated by the reaction with thrombin coupled Sepharose 4B at 37 C for 1 hour was incubated with 100 µg ml of monoclonal antibody at 37 C overnight. After the incubation, synthetic fluorescent substrate t butyloxycarboxy Leu Ser Thr Arg 4 methylcoumaryl 7 amide was added to the incubation mixture and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The measurements of fluorescence emitted by hydrolytic activity of protein Ca was carried out with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 460 nm. Antibodies 1 18 10 and 3 54 5 inhibited the protein Ca activity at the ratio of 78.7 and 79.4 . Antibodies 2 27 4, 2 41 3, 2 45 9, 2 47 8, 2 101 17, 2 105 6 and 2 115 1 showed no inhibion. The effect of monoclonal antibody to the inactivation of Factor Va activated Factor V by protein C was examined by measuring the change in prothrombinase activity of Factor Va using fluorescent synthetic substrate t butyloxycarboxy Val Pro Arg 4 methylcoumaryl 7 amide in the presence of activated Factor X, Calcium ion and phospholipid. Anitbody 3 54 5, 1 18 10, 2 101 17, 2 105 6 and 2 115 1 inhibited the inactivation of Factor Va by protein C. Protein C was incubated with 500 µg ml of monoclonal antibody at 37 C overnight, then thrombin coupled Sepharose 4B was added and the mixture was incubated at 37 C for 1 hour with shaking. After centrifugation of the mixture, fluorescent synthetic substrate as described above was added to the supernatant and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The measurement of fluorescence was carried out in the same manner. Antibody 2 45 9, 1 18 10 and 3 54 5 inhibited the reaction. From the results of example 2 iv and this example, antibody 2 45 9 was thought to inhibit the effect of thrombin to the heavy chain of protein C. 30 µl of protein Ca 2.0 µg and 20 µl of monoclonal antibody 9.6 µg were incubated in 750 µl of the buffer consisting of 0.05 M Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl and 0.1 bovine serum albumin at 4 C overnight. Then, 200 µl of protein C inhibitor 2.0 µg was added, and residual activity of protein Ca was measured using the synthetic fluorescent substrate t butyloxycarboxy Leu Ser Thr Arg 4 methylcoumaryl 7 amide . When the protein Ca was treated with antibody 1 18 10, a half of the enzyme activity remained before addition of the inhibitor, however, this activity decreased very litte even 50 minutes after addition of the inhibitor. Antibody 1 18 10 was thought to block the action of the protein C inhibitor on protein Ca. The protein Ca catalyzed inactivation of coagulation Factor Va is stimulated about fifteen times by another vitamin K dependent protein S. Protein Ca was treated beforehand with the monoclonal antiboly at 4 C overnight. When the effect of protein Ca on the inactivation of Factor Va was examined by measureing the change in prothrombinase activity of Factor Va as described in Example 2 v , the stimulatory effect of protein S on the action of protein Ca was specifically inhibited 90 by antibody 2 115 1 and 60 by 2 101 17. Antigenic determinant of monoclonal antibody on protein C was examined with immunoblotting system Bio Rad Lab. using goat anti mouse IgG as second antibody and autoradiography. Antibody 1 18 10, 2 45 9, 2 105 6, 3 15 7 and 3 54 5 were found to bind to the heavy chain of protein C. Antibody 2 27 4, 2 41 3 2 95 2 and 2 115 1 were assumed to bind to the light chain. Antibody 2 47 8 and 2 97 10 were speculated to direct toward. The antigenic determinant containing amino acids on both the light and heavy chains of protein C or toward a specific conformation of intact protein C.
