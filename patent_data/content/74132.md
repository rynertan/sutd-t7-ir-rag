## Description
PROTECTION OF CROPS AGAINST SOIL PESTS EMPLOYING AN ALKYLBENZYL CYCLOPROPANE CARBOXYLATE, NOVEL CYCLOPROPANE CARBOXYLATES, ANDCOMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM This invention relates to the use as soil insecticides of a group of alkylbenzyl pyrethroids, certain members of which group are novel compounds. The prior art contains numerous patents and literature articles on pyrethroids, particularly for household and agricultural use. However, those pyrethorids which have recently found favour in agricultural applications because of high toxicity in foliar applications have, in general, not exhibited practical insecticidal activity. There has therefore been a need for a soil insecticide having the low mammalian toxicity characteristic of pyrethroids. The present invention thus provides a method for the protection of crops against attack from soil dwelling insects and their larvae, which comprises applying to soil in which such crops are growing or are to be grown an insecticidally effective amount of an alkylbenzyl cyclopropane carboxylate of the formula EMI1.1 wherein R1 represents a tetrahaloethyl or dihalovinyl group R2 represents an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms n is O, 1, 2, 3 or h and each X, which may be the same or different when n greater than 1, independently represents an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom. Examples of compounds within the scope of the invention are the following esters of 2 2,2 dichlorovinyl 3,3 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid 3 methylbenzyl, 2 ethylbenzyl, 2 ethyl6 methylbenzyl, 4 n propylbenzyl, 4 isopropylbenzyl, 3,4 dimethylbenzyl, 2 ,5 dimethylbenzyl, 2 ,3 dimethylbenzyl, 3,5 dimethylbenzyl, 2,3 ,6 trimethylbenzyl, 2,3,4 trimethylbenzyl, 2,3,5 trimethylbenzyl, 2,3,4, 5 tetramethylbenzyl , 2 methyl 4 ethylbenzyl, 2,6 dimethyl 4 ethylbenzyl, 2 chlor o 6 methylbenzyl, 2 chloro4,6 dimethylbenzyl, 2,4 dichloro 6 methylbenzyl, 2,6 dichloro 4methylbenzyl, 2,6 dimethyl 4 chlorobenzyl, 2 methyl 6 fluorobenzyl, 2 methyl 4 fluorobenzyl, 2 fluoro 4 methylbenzyl, 2,4 difluoro 6 methylbenzyl, 2,6 difluoro 4 methylbenzyl, 2,4 dimethyl 6 fluorobenzyl, 2, 6 dimethyl 4 fluorobenzyl , 2 fluoro 4ethylbenzyl, 2 chloro 4 ethylbenzyl, 2 fluoro 6 ethylbenzyl, 2,6difluoro 4 ethylbenzyl and the corresponding esters with 2 2,2 dibromovinyl 3, 3 dimethyl cyclopropanecarboxylic acid and the like. The alkylbenzene cyclopropane carboxylates defined above are novel, with the exception of those compounds wherein the alkyl benzyl group is 2,6 dimethylbenzyl, 2 methylbenzyl, 2 bromo 3methylbenzyl, 2 bromo 6 methylbenzyl and 3,5 dimethyl 4 chlorobenzyl, and in a further embodiment this invention includes also such novel compounds Der se. Suitable compounds are those wherein R1 represents a di bromodichloroethyl, dichlorovinyl or dibromovinyl group. Preferably R1 represents a 2,2 dichlorovinyl group, n is O, 1 or 2 and the substituents R2 and X on the benzene ring are located at the 2 and or 4 and or 6 positions, and in particular such compounds wherein R2 is a methyl or ethyl group and X is a methyl or ethyl group or a chlorine atom, especially those wherein R2 is methyl and X is methyl or chlorine. Suitable alkylbenzyl groups thus include 2 methylbenzyl, 4 methylbenzyl, 4 ethylbenzyl, 2,6dimethylbenzyl, 2,4 dimethylbenzyl, 2 methyl 4 chlorobenzyl, 2 methyl 6 chlorobenzyl and 2,4,6 trimethylbenzyl. The active compounds may exist as optical isomers by virtue of the asymmetric carbon atom or atoms in the acid moiety. Use of the racemic mixture and various forms of mixtures of the possible isomers as well as the single isomers are within the scope of the invention, for example, the trans form, but preferably, the cis form and especially the lR,cis form of cyclopropanecarboxylic acids and when these forms are used substantially free of other stereoisomers, their purity is at least about 75 and preferably at leaset about 80 . Higher purities, such as at least 95 are especially useful. The active compounds are conveniently applied in the form of compositions comprising also one or more carriers and or surface active agents. The term carrier as used herein means a material, which may be inorganic or organic and of synthetic or natural origin, with which the active compound is mixed or formulated to facilitate its application to the soil, or its storage, transport or handling. The carrier may be a solid or a liquid. Any of the materials usually applied in formulating pesticides, herbicides, or fungicides may be used as the carrier. Suitable solid carriers are natural and synthetic clays and silicates, for example, natural silicas such as diatomaceous earths magnesium silicates, for example, talcs magnesium aluminium silicates, for example, attapulgites and vermiculites aluminium silicates, for example, kaolinites, montmorillinites and micas calcium carbonates calcium or aluminium silicates elements, for example, carbon and sulphur natural and synthetic resins such as, for example coumarone resins, polyvinyl chloride and styrene polymers and copolymers solid polychlorophenols bitumen waxes such as, for example, beeswax, paraffin wax, and chlorinated mineral waxes and solid fertilisers, for example, superphosphates. Suitable liquid carriers are water, alcohols, for example, isopropanol and glycols ketones, for example, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, and cyclohexanone ethers aromatic hydrocarbons, for example, benzene, toluene and xylene petroleum fractions, for example, kerosine and light mineral oils chlorinated hydrocarbons, for example, carbon tetrachloride, perchloroethylene, trichloroethane and liquified normally vaporous, gaseous compounds. Mixtures of different liquids are often suitable. The surface active agent may be an emulsifying agent or a dispersing agent or a wetting agent it may be non ionic or ionic. Any of the surface active agents usually applied in formulating pesticides, herbicides or fungicides, may be used.Examples of suitable surface active agents are the sodium or calcium salts of polyacrylic acids and lignin sulphonic acids the condensation products of fatty acids or aliphatic amines or amides containing at least 12 carbon atoms in the molecule with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide fatty acid esters of glycerol, sorbitan, sucrose or pentaerythritol condensates of these with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide condensation products of fatty alcohols or alkyl phenols for example p octylphenol or p octylcresol, with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide sulphates or sulphonates of these condensation products alkali or alkaline earth metal salts, preferably sodium salts of sulphuric or sulphonic acid esters containing at least 10 carbon atoms in the molecule, for example, sodium lauryl sulphate, sodium secondary alkyl sulphates, sodium salts or sulphonated castor oil, and sodium alkylaryl sulphonates such as sodium dodecylbenzene sulphate and polymers of ethylene oxide and copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. The compositions may be formulated as wettable powders, dusts, granules, solutions, emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, suspension concentrates and aerosols. Wettable powders are usually compounded to contain 25, 50 and 75 of toxicant and usually contain, in addition to solid carrier, 3 10 w of a dispersing agent and, where necessary, 0 10 w of stabiliser s and or other additives such as penetrants or stickers. Dusts are usually formulated as a dust concentrate having a similar composition to that of a wettable powder but without a dispersant, and are diluted in the field with further solid carrier to give a composition usually containing 1 2 10 w of toxicant. Granules are usually prepared to have a size between 10 and 100 BS mesh 1.676 0.152 mm , and may be manufactured by agglomeration or impregnation techniques.Generally, granules will contain 1 225 w toxicant and 0 10 w of additives such as stabilisers, slow release modifiers and binding agents. Emulsifiable concentrates usually contain, in addition to the solvent and, when necessary, co solvent, 10 50 w toxicant, 2 20 w v emulsifiers and 020 w v of appropriate additives such as stabilisers, penetrants and corrosion inhibitors.Suspension concentrates are compounded so as to obtain a stable, non sedimenting flowable product and usually contain 10 75 w toxicant, 0.5 15 w of dispersing agents, 0.1 10 w of suspending agents such as protective colloids and thixotropic agents, 0 10 w of appropriate additives such as defoamers, corrosion inhibitors, stabilisers, penetrants and stickers, and as liquid carrier, water or an organic liquid in which the toxicant is substantially insoluble certain organic solids or inorganic salts may be dissolved in the liquid carrier to assist in preventing sedimentation or as antifreeze agents for water. Aqueous dispersions and emulsions, for example, compositions obtained by diluting a wettable powder or a concentrate according to the invention with water, also lie within the scope of the present invention. The said emulsions may be of the water in oil or of the oil in water type, and may have a thick mayonnaise like consistency. The compositions may also contain other ingredients, for example, other compounds possessing pesticidal, herbicidal or fungicidal properties. The compounds are particularly useful for controlling a variety of insects in the soils which are damaging to growing plants. The effectiveness of these materials as soil insecticides for protecting growing plants is surprising in view of the low soil activity of other pyrethroids widely used as foliar insecticides. The materials of the invention are well suited for the control of Diabrotica species, for example, Diabrotica virgifera Le Conti, Diabrotica longicornis Say , and Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi Barber, the western, northern and southern corn rootworm, respectively, particularly in their larval stages.Because the materials of the invention have unusually good larvicidal activity, they may be advantageously used against rootworms, cutworms and wireworms, for example, larvae ofDiabrotica rootworms , Agrotis, Crymodes, Amathes, Euxoa, Peridroma, LaciniDolia, Nephelodes, Actebia, Feltia, Loxagrotis cutworms , Agriotes, Lemonius, Horiatonotus, Ctenicera,Conoderus wireworms and the like. Some of the better known larval species of the above are Agrotis ipsilon Hufnagel black cutworm , Agriotes mancus soy wheat wireworm and particularly the three Diabrotica species mentioned above. The materials of the invention are suitably applied to the soil at a rate of from about 0.1 to about llkg ha. Good control of soil inhabiting insects is obtained at rates of from about 0.1 to about 5kg ha, and especially from about 0.1 to about 4kg ha. In the method according to the invention, the active ingredient can be conveniently formulated for use as granules or powders containing a solid diluent impregnated with the active ingredient.Such formulations usually contain from about 1 to 50 by weight of active ingredient. More effective control will result when the formulation is physically mixed with the topsoil, as by harrowing, for example, as a pre treatment before seeding. The formulations can be applied as a drench, that is as a solution or dispersion of the active ingredient in a non phytotoxic solvent or liquid diluent, suitably water. Such drenches can be prepared by diluting with water a concentrate containing the active ingredient, an emulsifying agent, and preferably an organic solvent such as toluene. The formulations can be applied as a band, furrow or side dress, and can either be incorporated into the soil or not. The active compounds may be obtained, for example, by treating 2 2,2 dichlorovinyl 3,3 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid or a reactive derivative thereof, such as acid chloride, salt or alkyl ester, with the appropriately substituted alkylbenzyl alcohol or reactive derivative thereof, such as halide, as, for example, in French patent 2,290,415. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of Åa suitable base, for example, a tertiary amine, such as triethylamine or an alkali metal carbonate, such as potassium or sodium carbonate, in the presence of an inert solvent. The kinds of acids and reactive derivatives thereof are known from Farkas, J. et al., CollectionCzechoslov. Chem. Commun., pages 2230 6 1958 U.S. patents 4,024,163, 4,179,575 4,257,978 and the alcohols are known from, for example, U.S. patent 3,567,740.

After venting traces of solvent, the soil moisture level is brought to 9 by adding water and thoroughly mixing. 60g of moist soil is added to a 1O0ml wide mouthed jar to half full. Two sweet corn seeds, which have been surface sterilized in 0.2 sodium hypochlorite solution for 15 minutes and rinsed with water, are pressed into the soil near the perimeter of the jar. A small cavity of about 2. vac is opened in the surface of the soil and 20 Diabrotica undecimDunctata undecim punctata Mannerheim western spotted cucumber beetle eggs are placed in the well. They are immediately covered over with fineseived Zonolite or Vermiculite and the covering material is wet with about 1.3cc of water. The jar is then capped with a lid into which two 2mm holes have been drilled for ventilation. The jars are placed under lamps at 27 C for holding. The eggs are generally two to four days old. After one week, the jar contents are examined for the presence of live larvae and the number is recorded and the corn roots are examined for feeding damage. Compounds showing control at 3 ppm or lower rate in the first week are evaluated at subsequent weeks. Activity at 3 ppm indicates viable soil insecticidal activity.
