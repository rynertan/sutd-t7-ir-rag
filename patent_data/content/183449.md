# OPTICAL COUPLERS

## Abstract
Optical couplers, whether in integrated or fibre optics, where there is at least one input lightpath 26 coupled to two or more output lightpaths 27 by depositing a film 4 of resistive metal over the coupling region and passing current through the film. This heats up the coupler and thus increases the refractive index forming a preferential light path through the heat region 24 . Thus by heating particular regions, and by varying current through the film, the coupler is tuned as desired.
