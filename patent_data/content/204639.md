# Joint laxity measurement.

## Abstract
A method for measuring parameters relating to the stabil ity of joints in a patient s body includes the steps of securing a reference portion of the joint that portion of the joint closest to the body to a fixed location. A three dimensional digitiza tion of the size, shape, position and coordinate system of the two portions is performed. A soft tissue compensation proce dure is performed by applying forces to the reference portion of the joint to thereby determine the amount of reference portion motion, in the soft tissue surrounding the reference portion, due to these forces. A variety of forces are applied to the relative portion of a joint, which is movable relative to the reference portion thereof, and the total motion of the refer ence and relative portions associated with the forces are mea sured. By subtracting the motion determined in the soft tissue compensation from motion as determined by applying a vari ety of forces, the motion of only the relative portion relative to the reference portion is determined.
