# MASS FLOW RATE CONTROL METHOD FOR COMPRESSOR DIFFUSERS

## Abstract
An aerodynamically tapered spike 60 is positioned for controlled axial movement in the conical portion 34 of a composite gas turbine engine diffuser 16 controlling engine air mass flow rate by adjusting diffuser area ratio at the entrance 38 to the conical portion 34 . Also, a straight pipe transition diffuser portion 44 connects the conical portion 34 and a flat plate type diffuser portion 50 and changes the velocity profile from an axially skewed profile 42 into a flat profile 48 at the entrance 52 to the plate type portion 50 . The spike 60 is fixed to an axially moveable rod 62 extending through an aperture 58 in the flat impaction wall 56 of the plate type diffuser portion 50 .
