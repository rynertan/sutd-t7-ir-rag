# Low power circuitry components.

## Abstract
Low power circuitry components such as printed circuits with their associated resistors, transistors, chips and so on are formed from a plurality of laminae 100, 120, 150, 160 held together in a stack in order to avoid crossing circuits, connections where cross overs are necessary, are made by providing one part 108 of a circuit on one lamina 100 connecting that to another part 139 on another lamina 120 by means of a perpendicular connection 109 and thence, for example, by a further perpendicular connection 142 to a connection 162 on a bottom lamina 160 to chip encapsulated between some of the laminae 120, 150, 160 . The invention enables not only easier circuit design but also easier component assembly whereby chips and so on can be self locatable in the assembly.
