## Description
The present invention relates to granular detergent compositions having fabric softening properties. Certain amines in intimate mixture with a dispersing aid in the compositions provide through the wash softness and anti static benefits. Detergent compositions in spray dried form containing said amines are disclosed. the compositions also contain a clay softener The use of softeners to treat fabrics subsequent to a washing operation is a well known laundering practice. Fabric softeners are, in the main, cationic materials which are incompatible with anionic detersive surfactants used in most fabric washing compositions. For that reason, the softening operation is generally carried out in the laundry rinse bath after the surfactant has been removed from the washing machine. This entails additional work for the user. Formulators of fabric laundering compositions have long sought means whereby the fabric washing and softening could be done concurrently. Methods employing clay softeners, amine complexes or mixtures of clay and various amine materials, and the like, are described in the following patents German 29 64 114, 28 57 163, 24 39 541, 23 34 899 and EP 0 023 367, 0 026 528 and 0 028 432, and in EP A 123400, EP A 7135 and EP A 133804. The use of mixtures of amines and soaps salts of fatty acids as through the wash softeners is disclosed in U.K. patent 1 514 276. The amines of this reference are selected on the basis of their having an isoelectric point of from 8.3 to 9.8, i.e. such that they have no positive charge during the wash cycle, and become positively charged during the rinse cycle. The present invention employs a certain class of amines, intimately mixed with a dispersing aid, in an otherwise conventional detergent composition matrix, and clay, to provide cleaning and, concurrently, softening. The compositions herein may be described succinctly as granular detergent compositions which contain conventional detergent ingredients such as detersive surfactants including anionics , detergency builders and optionally optical brighteners, detersive enzymes, fabric bleaches, and the like, all at conventional levels, which contain clay fabric softeners preferably, smectite clays , which further contain at least 0.1 preferably 1.0 to 20 of an amine having an isoelectric point of at least 9.5, preferably those of the formula R₁R₂R₃N, wherein R₁ is C₉ to C₂₀ hydrocarbyl and R₂ and R₃ are each C₁ to C₄ hydrocarbyl, C₂ to C₁₀ alkoxylated hydrocarbyl or hydrogen, the amine being in intimate mixture with a dispersing aid, wherein said dispersing aid is a polycarboxylin acid or an inorganic acid. The amine acid mixture is sprayed onto the granular detergent matrix. As noted hereinafter, the compositions of this invention comprise, in major part, conventional ingredients that are quite familiar to formulators of granular detergent compositions. Surprisingly, the amines used herein are entirely compatible with such conventional detergent ingredients, even anionic surfactants. The amines suitable for the compositions herein are selected so that they have an isoelectric point in excess of 9.5, preferably in excess of 10.0. Examples are amines having general formula R₁R₂R₃N, wherein R₁ is C₈ to C₂₀ hydrocarbyl, preferably C₈ to C₂₀ alkyl, more preferably C₁₀ to C₁₄ alkyl, and most preferably C₁₂ alkyl or a mixture of C₁₂ and C₁₄ alkyl. R₂ and R₃ are each, independently, C₁ to C₁₀, hydrocarbyl, or hydrogen. Examples of suitable hydrocarbyl radicals are C₁ to C₄ alkyl or hydroxyalkyl, and C₂ to C₁₀ alkoxylated alkyl, in particular ethoxylated alkyl radicals. Amines wherein R₂ and R₃ are identical C₁ to C₄ alkyl, especially methyl, are preferred. Prior to incorporation into the detergent matrix, the amines are intimately mixed with a dispersing aid. It has been found that a specific class of compounds, most of which are not generally considered to be dispersing aids, are particularly suitable to be used as dispersing aids in combination with the amines defined herein. This class of compounds consists of polycarboxylic acids and inorganic acids, like HF, HCl, HBr, H₂SO₄, HNO₃, HNaSO₄, H₂SO₃, HNaSO₃. Although not intended to be limited by theory, a possible mechanism by which Bronstedt acids act as dispersing aids could be as follows. The acids protonate a portion of the amine. The protonated amine, in turn, acts as a dispersing aid for the remaining unprotonated amine. This mechanism suggests that protonated amines The criticality of the high isoelectric point of the amines at least 9.5, preferably 10.0 or higher suggest that it is important that, if protonation indeed takes place, the amines remain protonated during the wash cycle of a laundry program. On the other hand, it is critical that the dispersing aid be intimately mixed with the amine. Simply allowing the amines to be contacted by the dispersing aid in the wash liquor apparently is not sufficient to obtain the superior softening performance. In general terms, the amine dispersing aid mixtures which are key to this invention are prepared separately from the balance of the composition and then the sprayed onto the granular detergent matrix. If the dispersing aid is a Bronstedt acid, this can most conveniently be done by preparing a melt preferably 1 1 mole ratio of the acid and the amine and maintaining under continuous mixing the melt stage for about ten minutes whereby the complex forms. If the dispersing aid is an acid, the molar ratio amine acid preferably is about 1 1, but good fabric softening results can also be obtained by mixing the amine with a sub stoichiometric amount of acid. For good results, the acid amines ratio should be at least 1 10, preferably at least 1 5. The amine dispersing aid mixtures are used herein at levels of at least 0.1 , typically at levels of 0.5 to 20 , most preferably from 1 to 10 of the detergent compositions. The protonated amine is used in combination with a detergent compatible clay softener. Such clay softeners are well known in the detergency patent literature and are in broad commercial use, both in Europe and in the United States. Included among such clay softeners are various heat treated kaolines and various multi layer smectites. Preferred clay softeners are smectite softener clays that are described in German patent document 2 334 899 and in U.K. patent 1 400 898, which can be referred to for details. Softener clays are used in the preferred compositions at levels of at least 1 , generally 1 20 , preferably 2 7 . The compositions of this invention will contain organic surface active agents surfactants to provide the usual cleaning benefits associated with the use of such materials. Detersive surfactants useful herein include well known synthetic anionic, nonionic, amphoteric and zwitterionic surfactants. Typical of these are the alkylbenzene sulfonates, alkyl and alkylether sulfates, paraffin sulfonates, olefin sulfonates, alkoxylated especially ethoxylated alcohols and alkyl phenols, amine oxides, α sulfonates of fatty acids and of fatty acid esters, and the like, which are well known from the detergency art. In general, such detersive surfactants contain an alkyl group in the C₉ C₁₈ range the anionic detersive surfactants can be used in the form of their sodium, potassium or tri ethanolammonium salts the nonionics generally contain from 5 to 17 ethylene oxide groups. U.S. Patent 4.111.855 contains detailed listings of such typical detersive surfactants. C₁₁ C₁₆ alkyl benzene sulfonates, C₁₂ C₁₈ paraffin sulfonates and alkyl sulfates, and the ethoxylated alcohols and alkyl phenols are especially preferred in the compositions of the present type. Also useful herein as the surfactant are the water soluble soaps, e.g. the common sodium and potassium coconut or tallow soaps well known in the art. The surfactant component can comprise as little as 1 of the compositions herein, but preferably the compositions will contain 5 to 40 , preferably 10 to 30 , of surfactant. Mixtures of the ethoxylated nonionics with anionics such as the alkyl benzene sulfonates, alkyl sulfates and paraffin sulfonates are preferred for through the wash cleansing of a broad spectrum of soils and stains from fabrics. The laundry compositions herein also preferably contain enzymes to enhance their through the wash cleaning performance on a variety of soils and stains. Amylase, protease and lipase enzymes suitable for use in detergents are well known in the art and in commercially available liquid and granular detergents. Commercial detersive enzymes preferably a mixture of amylase and protease are typically used at levels of 0.001 to 2 , and higher, in the present compositions. Moreover, the compositions herein can contain, in addition to ingredients already mentioned, various other optional ingredients typically used in commercial products to provide aesthetic or additional product performance benefits. Typical ingredients include pH regulants, perfumes. dyes, bleach, optical brighteners, soil suspending agents, hydrotropes and gel control agents, freeze thaw stabilizers, bactericides, preservatives, suds control agents, bleach activators and the like. In a through the wash mode, the compositions are typically used at a concentration of at least 500 ppm, preferably 0.10 to 1.5 , in an aqueous laundry bath at pH 7 11, preferably at pH 9 11, to launder fabrics. The laundering can be carried out over the range from 5 C to the boil, with excellent results. The following example is typical of the preparation of an amine dispersing aid mixture to be used in the preferred compositions of this invention containing smectite softener clays, but is not intended to limit the scope of the invention. Citric acid is dissolved in methanol at ca. 30 C . After the addition of the amine, the mixture is stirred for about 15 minutes. Then the methanol is evaporated e.g. by heating and the solid residue mixture of citric acid dimethyl myristyl amine is subsequently dried and ground to the desired particle size. This method for preparing the mixture of amine dispersing aid is suitable when the melting point of the dispersing aid is too high.
