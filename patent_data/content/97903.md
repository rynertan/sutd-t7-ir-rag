# Method of electron beam exposure.

## Abstract
A method of electron beam exposure comprising selec tively exposing a resist film on a substrate 34 a plurality of times with an electron beam whose dose is lower than a desired dose sufficient to produce a difference in molecular weight between the exposed area and nonexposed area, the cumulative dose corresponding to said desired dose.
