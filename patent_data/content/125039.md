# Enzymatic production of phospholipid saccharide derivatives.

## Abstract
A process for producing a saccharide derivative of a phospholipid, which comprises reacting a phospholipid with a monosaccharide having 5 to 7 carbon atoms, at least one primary alcohol group and at least three hydroxyl groups in total including the OH of the primary alcohol group or a disac charide thereof, said saccharide being optionally substituted by a group selected from the class consisting of amino and acetylamino groups, or a phenolglycoside of said saccharide in the presence of phospholipase DM.
