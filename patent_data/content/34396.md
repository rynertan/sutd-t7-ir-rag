# Method of controlling the energy management of an energy system and energy system based on said method.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of controlling the energy management of a system for catching, accumulating and transferring heat comprising a heat collector 1 and a heat accumulator 5 of the thermally stratified type forming part of a heat recovery circuit adapted to pass a heat transport fluid, said heat accumulator forming furthermore part of a consumer circuit adapted to pass the heat transport fluid. Hereto the heat capacity flux, that is to say, the mass flux multiplied by the specific heat of the heat transport fluid through the consumer circuit and the mean value thereof during a selectable time interval, is determined or estimated at least by approximation and the heat capacity flux through the heat recovery circuit is adjusted so that the difference between the mean value of the heat capacity flux through the heat recovery circuit during a time interval of the same dura tion as said selectable time interval and said mean value of the heat capacity current through the consumer circuit is equal to a factor to be selected multiplied by the heat capacity of the heat accumulator, divided by said time interval, said factor lying between 0 and 3. Further the invention relates to a system for carrying out said method.
