# SPEED COMPENSATOR TIMING CIRCUIT FOR ACTUATING A SHEETER MACHINE

## Abstract
A speed compensated timing circuit which detects the velocity of a moving sheet which is to be cut or otherwise processed and which automatically calculates the time delay for actuating a mechanically operating device which controls the cut sheets and which correctly considers and compensates for the delay time of the ac tuator.
