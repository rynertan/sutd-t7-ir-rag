# Encapsulation by interfacial polycondensation.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for encapsulation, and particularly to the production of small or minute capsules constituted by a skin or thin wall of polyurea, which involves bringing together an aqueous phase containing a lignin sulfonate emulsifier and a water immiscible phase containing a water immiscible material, the material to be encapsulated, plus polymethylene polyphenylisocyanate, dispersing the water immiscible phase in the aqueous phase followed by addition of a polyfunctional amine. Polymethylene polyphenylisocyanate reads with the amine to form a solid polyurea shell wall about the encapsulated material. The capsules formed may be directly used as aqueous suspensions. In the practice of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the material to be encapsulated is a herbicide, particularly an acetanilide or thiocarbamate herbi cide and more particularly alachlor, butachlor, propachlor, triallate and diallate hebicides.
