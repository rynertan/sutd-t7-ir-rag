# Radiation detector.

## Abstract
A radiation detector is assembled using spacers which contact one another through apertures in plates, so that the relevant thickness dimension of the dimensionally accurate spacers determines the spacing of the electrode plates. Thickness variations of the plates can be compensated for by a supporting surface of the spacers which is provided with raised portions which can be depressed. The plates may be constructed as laminations for a collimator beyond which a radiation sensitive element is arranged and can also form electrode plates for a gas ionization detector.
