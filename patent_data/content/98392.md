# Filtration membrane and process for producing the membrane.

## Abstract
Filtration membrane, especially adapted for use in he mofiltration as well as filtration of infusion solutions. The membrane, preferably in the form of a hollow fiber, is made of a polymer which is soluble in a polar, non protonic organic solvent. The most preferred polymer for the membrane material is polyamide. Characterizing for the membrane is high ultrafiltration rates permeabilities to water of up to 500 10 ⁴ ml sec. cm² atm., and imper meability to albumin M The membrane is prepared by extruding a polymer solution with a center liquid under conditions such that the volume of polymer solution to volume of center liquid ratio is within the range of from 2 1 to 4 1. Simultaneously, the inner diameter to wall thickness ratio of the hollow fiber is preferably correlated to the polymer concentration and is set to 150 75 to 280 75 at a polymer concentration of 5 20 . The most preferred such correlation is 220 75 at a polymer concentration of 11 .
