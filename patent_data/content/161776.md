# Detecting oxygen concentration in a gas.

## Abstract
An oxygen sensor utilises the paramagnetic property of oxygen to determine the relative concentration of oxygen in a test gas. The test gas is supplied to a core of an electromagnet 20 or a gap of a permanent magnet. A known magnetic flux density B for the electromagnet 20 or permanent magnet is utilised in conjunction with a Hall effect sensor 30 to determine a change in flux which is primarily due to the oxygen component of the test gas.
