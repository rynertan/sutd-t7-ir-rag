# Fuel injection nozzle mounting apparatus.

## Abstract
Fuel injection nozzle mounting apparatus for an engine includes a holder 40 having a stem 41, and first and sec ond flange 43 and 44 extending laterally from opposite ends of the stem and formed with first and second through holes 43a and 44a for receiving opposite end portions of each injection nozzle therethrough. First and second resilient sealing members 50 and 60 are fitted on the opposite end portions of each injection nozzle at locations within the first and second through holes of the first and second flanges to resiliently support the nozzle against the holder. The first and second flanges of the holder are rigidly joined to an engine part and a fuel supply pipe, so that the injection nozzles are resiliently supported between the latter parts. Further, a heat insulating mem ber 70 may be interposed between the first flange of the holder and the engine part. The heat insulating member has a third through hole 71 formed therein, aligned with the first through hole of the holder and receiving the first resilient sealing member 50 therein.
