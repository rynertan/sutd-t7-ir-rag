## Description
The present invention relates to a plant for stacking automatically, on respective lifting platforms, packs of panels of different sizes coming, in any succession, from either a dividing machine or any other processing machine. The plant according to the invention, subsequently, orderly arranges the stacks of panels from each stacking station adjacent to each other, at respective stations, so as to form parallelepiped assemblies which are then transferred to a discharge station, for example to a strapping station or to a plastics film wrapping station, after having been arranged on a pallet or other supporting or protecting means. The characteristics of said plant and the advantages resulting therefrom will be apparent from the following description of a preferred embodiment thereof, shown merely by way of non limiting example in the figures of the accompanying sheets of drawings, in which In figure 1, the numeral 1 indicates a transport runway with parallel co planar belts, which advances the packs of panels coming from a dividing machine in the direction of the arrow F downstream of the latter machine there are arranged, preferably, devices of conventional design not shown for changing, if necessary, the orientation of said packs of panels by a 90 rotation, so that, on said runway 1, said packs will be arranged either side by side or in end to end sequence depending upon whether or not they have been rotated by 90 . Usually, the 90 rotation is imparted to the packs of panels having an elongated rectangular base, so that the longer dimension thereof will be transverse to the runway 1. With reference to figures 2 and 3, it will be noted that the powered belts of the runway 1 are mounted on vertically movable frames and that said belts are arranged between fixed planar and co planar supports 2 which, preferably, are coated with suitable material to avoid marring the panels. When the belts of the runway 1 are activated, they are lifted from said supports 2 which, thus, are prevented from contacting the packs of panels being transported. The transport runway 1 joins with an operative station A, where said runway 1 is characterized in that it comprises, instead of said supports 2 and co planar therewith, small idle wheels 3 supported by stationary frames having their axes oriented in the direction F in figure 1. The packs of panels to be stacked by the installation of the invention, are stopped at the station A by abutting with their front sides aganist a transverse stop or abutment bar 4 see also figures 4 and 5 which, usually, is in a lowered position and which is lifted only when scraps are present on said runway 1 and are to be transported beyond the station A towards collecting means not shown here . The abutment bar 4 comprises a vertical face to be contacted by the packs of panels P, and a rear face provided, in symmetrical arrangement, with a tern of vertical rods 5 slidable in guide supports 6 which are secured to a support beam 7 forming a part of a carriage structure described hereinafter rotatably mounting, by means of bearings 8, a shaft 9 which, through end pinions 10 10 , meshes with racks 11 11 which are formed on or attached to the end racks of said rods 5. Secured to said beam 7 are two cylinder and piston units 12 12 of the pressurized fluid and double acting type, the piston rods of which are connected to said abutment bar 4 which, due to said parts 9 10 11, will be moved by said units though remaining in a horizontal position. It will be noted in figure 4 that said abutment bar 4 is formed with recesses 13 in the lower side thereof to avoid interfering with the underlying members of the plant. It will be noted in figures 2 and 3 that when the pack, or packs, of panels will abut against the abutment bar 4, a suitable sensor not shown detects this condition and, at least, causes the powered belts of said runway 1 to be lowered, whereby said packs P will rest on the idle wheels 3. Under the side of the packs P abutting against the abut ment bar 4 there is provided a horizontal runway of rubber coated rollers 14, similar to each other and having their axes parallel to those of the wheels 3, said rollers being rotatably mounted in cantilever fashion on respective supports 15 which are fixed to the top side of a frame 16 the ends of which are pivotably connected, through parallel links 17, to a structure 18 comprising adjustable limit switches 19 19 co operating with said links. Pivotably connected o said structure 18 are the body portions of fluid operated double acting cylinder and piston units 20 20 , the piston rods of which are connected to end extensions 16 of said frame 16. The rollers 14, thus, may be raised and lowered while remaining in a horizontal condition. The hubs mounting said rollers 14 have keyed to their end portions protruding from the rear side of said supports 15, sprockets 21 having the same characteristics and driven, via a chain 22 and idle sprockets 23 with chain stretcher 24, by a sprocket 25 which is keyed on the shaft of a motor reducer 26 mounted on the frame 16. A torque limiter 27 is associated with the motor reducer 26. By activating said motor reducer 26, all the rollers 14 will be rotated at the same speed and in the proper direction to move the packs of panels P in the direction indicated by the arrow F1 in figure 1. During the working cycle at the station A, as explained with more detail hereinafter, the frame 16 with rollers 14 will be lifted up to a level equal or slightly higher than the sliding plane or path of movement defined by the rollers 3. Co planar with the rollers 14 in rectilinear extension therefrom, when in the upper working position figures 3 and 6 , there are provided further identical rubber coated rollers 28 which, unlike the former rollers, are rotatably mounted in a cantilever fashion on a frame 29 which is fixed to said structure 18. The rollers 28 concern the station A , which is adjacent the station A and connects the latter to the successive station B of the plant. The rollers 28 are kinematically connected, by a sprocket and chain drive system 30 31, to a drive unit 32 which, under command, causes said rollers to rotate in the same direction as the rollers 14 with the same surface speed. Above the edge of the packs of panels P contacting against the abutment bar 4, and opposed to said powered rollers of both the stations A A , there is provided a row of parallel and grooved rollers 33 which are, preferably, coated with rubber or any other suitable material and are rotatably and elastically mounted, as indicated at 34, on a presser 35 which is parallel to said abutment bar 4 and is provided at the ends thereof with plates 36 which, through rollers 37, slide on vertical guide plates 38 which are fixed to said beam 7 rotatably supporting a longitudinal shaft 39 which is actuated by a motor reducer unit 40 rotatable in both directions and which is provided at the ends thereof with pinions 41 41 in mesh with vertical racks 42 42 secured to said plates 36. At one side of the presser there is mounted parallelly, through an articulated parallelogram comprising links 43, a small bar 44 which is provided at the lower side thereof with idle rollers 45 parallel to the rollers 33 and normally protruding downwards beyond said rollers 33. Adjustable abutments 46 figure 8 define the rest position of the bar 44, said position being also detected by a sensor 47. The structures 7 38 and 18 29 are fixed to a powered carriage structure not illustrated because of conventional design which, under command, can move the assembly of the members of figure 2 along the length of the runway 1, as indicated by the arrows K. The stations A A operate as follows. When the pack or packs of panels contact against the abutment bar 4, the belts of the runway 1 are lowered and, at due time, the structure 16 is raised whereby the rollers 14 will engage the lower side of said packs and will be located either co planar or slightly above the path of travel or sliding plane formed by the idle wheels 3 supporting said packs. At due time the presser 35 is lowered to engage said pack with its rocking rollers 33 and press them properly by the action of the springs 34 and is stopped when the feeler 44 also engaging said packs through its small wheels 45, is lifted to modify the status of the sensor 47 that, automatically, disactivates the motion unit 40. The assembly of members of figure 2 is now moved through a short stroke in the direction of the arrow K in order to move the packs of panels clamped between the rollers 14 33 away from the packs possibly resting on the runway 1, so as to avoid any interference therewith. In the next step, the rollers 14 and 28 are activated, whereby the packs of panels P will be transferred in single file in the direction of the arrow F1, from the station A to the station A and then toward the station B. The presence of the torque limiter in the drive of motor reducer 26 eliminates undesired accelerations and de celerations in the handling of the packs of panels, which might disassemble said packs. When the front side of the leading pack P co operatingly engages a sensor 48 figure 3 , the motor reducer 26 is stopped and the rollers 14 are lowered, while the rollers 28 of the station A will remain activated to feed the pack properly spaced from the following pack to the station B of the plant. When the leading pack has moved past the sensor 48, if permitted by the operating program of the plant, the rollers 14 are lifted again and the motion unit 26 is re activated automatically to repeat said cycle. When the row of packs of panels at the station A has been exhausted, the presser 35 is lifted, the rollers 14 and 28 are stopped and the former of these rollers are lowered, whereafter the assembly of members of figure 2 is moved in the direction of the arrow K back to the original position thereof, while at due time the belts of the runway 1 will be lifted again, which will feed new packs of panels to the station A to repeat said cycle. The positioning of the sensor 48 at the station A is such as to avoid always a simultaneous clamping of two packs of panels between the rollers 28 and the rollers 33 of the presser 35 thereabove. According to a minor constructional modification, the cyclical stopping of the packs of panels at the station A, while they are being transferred to A and then to B, might be effected by the motion unit 26 and, therefore, with the aid of the torque limiter 27, without lowering the rollers 14. In this instance, the rollers 14 or some of these rollers that are in proximity of A , will be driven by the chain 22 free trip connections, whereby when the motor 26 is stopped, those rollers 14 supporting the pack that engages the station A may have a free idle rotation. With reference to figure 11, we will describe one of the stations B B B B receiving the packs of panels from the stations A A in single file and suitably spaced apart. In line with the presser 35 there is provided a similar presser 49 associated with all the stations B B ,B and provided with rubber coated and spring loaded rollers 50 similar to those of the preceding presser, and actuated by a vertical guide slide system, with pinion rack device and with oppositely rotatable motor reducer, similarly to the presser 35 described above. The presser 49, through a sensor not shown mounted thereon, detects the level position of the presser 35 upstream thereof and automatically adjusts itself to said position. At each station B of the plant, below the respective rollers 50 of the presser 49, there are provided parallel and identical rubber coated rollers 51 constituting a runway which is in line and coplanar with that of the rollers 28 at the station A , said rollers 51 being supported by a frame 52 which is pivoted at 53 to a stationary structure 54 and, therefore, can oscillate parallelly to the direction of movement indicated by the arrows F1, said frame being connected to fluid operated double acting cylinder and piston units 55 which, in turn, are secured at 56 to a stationary frame 57, the arrangement being such that, under command, the assembly 51 52 may be moved from the position shown with solid lines to the position shown with broken lines in figure 11, and vice versa. The rollers 51 are powered by means of a sprocket and chain drive 58 59 and a motor reducer unit 60 mounted on the rocking frame 52, as shown in figures 13 and 14. The side of the pack of panels that is opposite the side which is clamped between the rollers 50 51 is supported by rubber coated idle rollers 61 journaled on a comb like frame 62 figure 12 capable of oscillating parallelly to said support structure 64 having also connected thereto fluid operated double acting cylinder and piston units which are diagrammatically symbolized by the arrow 65 whereby, under command, said assembly 61 62 may be moved from the position shown with solid lines to the position shown with broken lines, and vice versa. The structure 64 is a carriage structure and can slide on stationary guides 66 which are normal to the direction of movement F1 of the panels at the stations B and have mounted thereon racks meshing in conventional manner with the end pinions of a shaft which is rotatably supported by said structure 64 and is connected to a motor reducer unit having a double direction of rotation not shown , the arrangement being such that the distance between the rollers 51 61 changes automatically depending upon the size of the packs of panels entering the stations B of the installation. The frame 62 provided with idle rollers 61 has affixed thereto vertical wings 67 which, viewed from above, have a substantially V shaped configuration and which are in line with each other so as to form a grid like barrier that, when the frame 62 is in its active position, is disposed on an imaginary vertical plane which is parallel to the direction of movement F1 of the packs of panels at the stations B of the installation. Opposed to said grid like barrier and parallel thereto, there is provided solidary with the stationary structure 54 mounting the rocking frame of the powered rollers 51 a guide 68 which at the bottom is also of grid like formation to ensure the required reedom of movement to said rollers 51 see also figures 11 and 14 . With reference again to figure 11, it will be seen that suitably spaced between the rollers 51 61 there are the flat shaped ends of the teeth 69 69 of respective comb like structures 70 70 , which are supported at the ends thereof by pairs of links 71 71 which are pivoted to supports 72 72 integral with the structures 54 64. The body of the comb like structures 70 70 has pivoted thereto, in the appropriate number and position, as shown at 73 73 , connecting rods 74 74 the top ends of which are connected to cranks 75 75 see figure 15 , the crank 75 being keyed to the end of a shaft 76 which is rotatably supported, through bearings 77, by the structure 54 and which is parallel to the guides 66. The crank 75 , on the other hand, is keyed to a bushing 78 which is rotatably supported, through bearings 79, by the structure 64 and which is so formed in the inner side thereof as to co operate with the longitudinal splined portion 76 of said shaft 76. Said bushing 78 and shaft 76 have normally secured thereto two levers 80 80 which are pivotably connected to the piston rods of respective fluid operated double acting cylinder and piston units 81 81 having their body portions secured to the structures 54 64. This solution permits a synchronous actuation of the comb like frames 70 70 which, following the actuation of the units 81 81 , may be moved from the position shown with solid lines to the position shown with broken lines in figure 11, and vice versa. Figures 11 and 12 that is pivoted at 82 82 to the structure 64, through parallel links 83 83 , so as to be pivotable parallelly to F1, there is a further comb like frame 84 having teeth 84 located between the teeth of the frame 62 and fixedly provided at the ends thereof with vertical plates 284 exactly aligned with each other, said frame 84 being connected to one or more cylinder and piston units which are diagrammatically symbolized by the arrow 85, and which hold it normally in the broken line position of figure 11 and which, under command, move it to the solid line position to operate on the side of the pack of panels which is opposite to that facing the stationary guide 68. With reference to figure 1, it will be seen that depending upon the size of the pack of panels reaching the station B and depending upon the operative stage of the installation, the programming device controlling the operation of the installation establishes at which of the four stations B a pack must be stopped to be stacked on an underlying lifting platform as discussed below. Arranged downstream of each station B B B B are respective mechanical abutments indicated at 86 86 86 86 in figure 1, the first mentioned three are of retractable type and the last mentioned one is stationary and constantly operative. One of the retractable abutments 86 is shown in figure 13, and it will be seen that it comprises a slide 86 which is vertically movable on a stationary guide 87 located below the runway defined by the powered rollers 51, said slide being connected to a fluid operated double acting cylinder and piston unit not shown which, under command, will move it from the solid line position to the lifted broken line position, or vice versa. Micro switches 88, only one of which is shown in figure 13, reveal the rest and the active positions of the slide 66 to the programmer. Again in figure 13, it will be seen that said guide 87 is at a small angle Z with respect to the vertical, whereby when the slide 86 is lowered after the latter has stopped the pack of panels at the desired station B, said slide 86 will move slightly away from the front side of said pack P, so as to avoid disordering and marring it. The front side of the slide 86 facing the stations A A of the installation is such as to present a perfectly vertical face when said slide is in its operative top position, regardless of said inclination Z of the assembly 96 87. Before the pack of panels P reaches the lifted abutment 86 see figure 1 , the front side of said pack is detected by a first sensor 89 which controls the decrease of the speed of advance of said pack see motor reducer unit 60 in figure 13 so that said pack is not put out of order when engaging against the abutment 86 and a second sensor 90 which stops said motor reducer unit 60 definitively. Similar sensors 89 90 , 89 90 and 89 90 are provided for the stations B B B . When the pack of panels has been properly stopped at one of the stations B see figure 11 , the teeth 69 69 of the comb like structures 70 70 are already in their lifted position, below the pack, ready to take over the rollers 51 61 when, at due time, they will be lowered and moved away. Thereafter, said comb like structures 70 70 are also moved away from the pack which will be softly transferred onto either a lifting platform 91 or a pack of panels previously deposited thereon. The jacks 85 figure 11 are then activated and urge the grid like formation constituted by the vertical small plates 284 against the adjacent side of the discharged pack of panels P whereby to force said pack to be positioned uniformly with its opposite side against the stationary guide 68. The stack of panels which is progressively built up on the lifting platform 91 is thus quite orderly arranged. Thereafter, the lifting platform 91 is lowered by the same extent as the pack transferred thereonto and the station B will be again in a condition permitting a new operative cycle as described above. Figures 17 and 18 show one of the sets of rubber coated rollers 92 arranged at the stations C C C of the installation, in line and co planar with the rollers 51 when in their active working position, said rollers being rotatably supported by a stationary structure 93 and being actuated by a respective motion unit 94 with a sprocket and chain drive 95, so as to be rotated concurrently and at the same speed as said rollers 51. The rollers 92 constitute a bridge permitting an appropriate transfer of the pack of panels from a station B to a next following station. Rollers which are similar to the rollers 92 though freely rotatable not shown , may be provided on the opposite side of the stations C and may be supported by a structure which is secured to the carriage 64 to beter support the pack while being transferred between said stations B. It will be seen in the figures 19 and 20 that each lifting platform 91 has a loading plane which is formed by a plurality of horizontal arms 91 , disposed normally to the direction of movement indicated by the arrow F2, and parallel and suitably spaced apart from each other, said arms being suitably shaped to permit the platform to reach the highest level when it is empty, as shown in figure 14. The arms 91 of said platform are secured in cantilever fashion at an end thereof to a common carriage beam 96 provided at the ends thereof with wheels 97 sliding within a pair of U shaped uprights 98 and comprised in the fixed framing of the stations B of the installation, said carriage beam provided at the ends thereof with sliding members 99 which are adapted to slide with enough precision on rectilinear vertical guides 100 secured to said uprights 98. At the two ends of the carriage 96 there are connected at 101 the ends of the two chains 102 only one of which is shown in figure 19, said chains being passed around sprockets 103 keyed on a shaft 104 which, in turn, is rotatably supported at the top of the stationary framing of the station B and is actuated by an oppositely rotating motor reducer unit 105. The outer end of the chains 102 is connected to counterweights 106 keeping said chains in a suitably taut condition and slidably guided within stationary housing 107. Sprockets 103 ensure a correct co operation of the chains 102 with the sprockets 103 and a correct guidance of said counterweights into the respective guide housings. At the stations B B B B the packs of panels of different sizes are stacked on each other over the underlying lifting platforms 91, according to the principle requiring panels of the same size on each platform to form a stack of a pre established height, whereafter said lifting platform 91 is moved automatically to its lowest position as shown with broken lines in figure 19. In this figure, the platform 91 is shown with solid lines in its highest position, and P indicates the bottom of the pack of panels when it is about to be deposited on the lifting platform. In figure 21 it will be noted that when the platform 91 is completely lowered, the stack of panels P built up thereon will engage and will be supported by a bed 108 extending both in the station B and adjacent station D and formed by a plurality of rectilinear, parallel and co planar frames 109 which are suitably spaced apart and are disposed with their longitudinal axes in the direction of the arr F2 and which are provided thereover with small idle wheels 110 so disposed as to permit the stack P to be moved in the direction of the arrow F2. Said frames 109 comprise at an end thereof integral extensions 111 pivoted at 113 to a common transom 112 which is secured to said uprights 98. The pivot 113 is parallel to the direction indicated by the arrow F1. At the opposite end thereof, said frames 109 are secured, through depending extensions 114, to a common transom 115 connected to fluid operated double acting cylinder and piston units 116 by means of which said bed 108 with the idle wheels may be moved from the solid line position to the broken line position of figure 21, and vice versa. When the stack of panels P is positioned on the bed 108, the latter is in the raised horizontal position and the arms 91 of the platform 91 will be lowered below the sliding plane constituted by the small wheels 110. Between said frames 109 and the teeth or arms 91 of said platform 91 there will be left sufficient spaces to permit the longitudinal movement therebetween of the teeth 117 of a pusher that, prior to said lowering step of the stack P , has moved automatically to the position shown with solid lines in figure 21, the arrangement being such that said teeth will protrude, by an aligned portion of suitable extent, from the bed 108, said teeth being secured to a common beam 118 see also figure 22 which is provided at the ends thereof with carriages 119 119 slidable in horizontal U shaped guides 120 120 located below said bed, parallelly to the direction of the arrows F2 and bridging the stations B D. Said carriages 119 119 are connected to the ends of respective chains 121 121 passed around sprockets 122 122 , the latter being keyed to a shaft 123 rotatably supported by the baseplate of the installation and connected through a sprocket and chain drive 124 to a motor reducer unit 125 which, when activated, moves said pusher 117 from the solid line position to the broken line position of figure 21, and vice versa, with resulting movement of the stack of panels P from the station B to the station E of figure 1 see arrows F2 . Thereafter, when said pusher 117 has moved back to its rest position the lifting platform 91 having already moved back to its top position , said bed 108 will be lowered to the broken line position to avoid interfering with the movable surface of station E during a following working step of this component, as will be explained more completely below. On completion of the operative cycle of this component, said bed 108 moves back to its horizontal position to repeat the cycle described above. While being transferred from the station B to the station E, said stack of panels P , preferably, is guarded at the sides thereof by suitable containing and guiding structures, not shown on the drawings because they are obvious and easily construed by those skilled in the art. At the station E see figures 23 24 25 , the stack of panels P will be positioned on the surface coated with protective material, such as synthetic velvet of a steel table 126 which is secured with two opposite sides thereof on two carriages 127 which are slidable through wheels having horizontal and vertical axes 128 within guide channels 129 having composite cross section and fixed above the guides 120 120 and parallel thereto. Sliding blocks 129 of a material having a low friction coefficient, such as nylon, engage the lower surface of the table 126 so as to improve the required stretching and planarity thereof. The ends of said carriages 127 are connected at 130 130 to the ends of respective chains 131 passed around pairs of sprockets 132 132 , the latter being keyed on a shaft 134 see also figure 21 journalled on the uprights 98 of the station B and connected through a sprocket and chain drive 135, to a motor reducer unit 136. The operation of these components will be discussed further hereinafter. If the length of the table 126, in the direction of the arrow F3 of figure 1, is longer than the length of the stack of panels P , one or more stacks will be normally arranged after each other on the same table 126, by as many strokes of the pusher 117. During these steps, the stack of panels that cyclically is pushed onto the table 126 will push forward the stack or stacks which are located already on said table. In the embodiment shown in figure 1 of the table 126 operating at the stations B D , the operative cycle of the pusher unit 117 is completed after three operative strokes. Conversely, in the embodiment of the table 126 operating at the stations B D , the operative cycle of the pusher unit 117 is completed after two operative cycles. The latter example also emphasizes that the stacks of panels positioned on the table 126 of one of the stations E of the installation may have a width which is smaller than that of said table 126, whereby a plurclity of rows of said stacks may be arranged side by side thereon in the example being considered, two rows of said stacks P are arranged thereon. This last mentioned arrangement of the rows of stacks on the table 126 is effected by a pusher 137 that, normally, in the position shown with solid lines in figure 1, at one side of the station E and that, under command, is activated in the direction indicated by the arrows F3 to sweep the table 126 transversely and to displace the first row of stacks P leftwards of the table when looking at figure 1 , until the front side thereof abuts against the feeler 138 of figure 26, which is slidable in a stationary guide 139, against the action of a spring 140, the displacement of said feeler being progressively detected by a plurality of micro switches 140 140 140 . When the micro switch 140 is activated, the pusher 137 is stopped and is returned to its rest position. In the next step, said pusher moves the new row of stacks against the previously displaced row to cause a further displacement of this first row, such as to be detected by the second micro switch 140 whereafter, in the previously considered example, the pusher is returned to its rest position having thus completed its operative cycle. In the example illustrated in figure 1 in connection with the station E , the respective pusher 137 completes its operative cycle after three complete strokes, involving the actuation, additionally, of the third micro switch 140 of figure 26. With reference also to figures 27 28 and 29, it will be seen that each pusher 137 137 137 137 of the stations E E E E is supported at an intermediate portion by the lower end of a vertical carrier forming therewith an inverted T shaped structure, the top end of said carrier being secured to a transom 142 which is provided at the ends thereof with carriages 143 143 slidable in horizontal guides 144 144 which are secured to the framing 145 of the station E. Secured to each carriage 143 143 are the ends of respective chains 146 passed around pairs of sprockets 147 147 , the latter of which are keyed to a shaft 148 journalled on the structure 145 and connected to a motor reducer unit 149 through a sprocket and chain drive. In figure 19, 150 indicates an opening in the transom 142 to allow the passage of the upper stretch of the chain 146. Components similar to those described above, indicated by the same number with a different suffix, are provided at the station E E and E of the installation. When the rows of the stacks of panels have been orderly arranged at the stations E of the installation, a retaining bar 151 shown with broken lines in figure 1 is lowered at the border area between the stations E D, extend close to or in substantial contact with said table 126. When said bar has reached its bottom operative position, the motion unit 136 is activated to remove the table 126 from the station E and transfer it temporarily to the station D which, as stated above, has been prepared for this occurrence. Said bar 151 retains the assembly of stacks of panels P at the station E, and obliges said assembly to softly come to rest onto a plane which substitutes for the said table and which may be formed by a pallet, a protecting panel or merely a roller sliding plane, as will be discussed more fully below. Figures 30 31 32 33 and 34 show various constructional and operating details of the retaining bar 151. This bar is provided at the ends thereof with carriages 152 152 which, through bearings 153, slide within rectilinear guide channels 154 154 which are fixed to the uprights 155 of the framing of said station E, said channels being characterized in that their lower portions are inclined toward the station E, so that said bar 151, during the final portion of its descent stroke, will approach the base of the assembly of stacks P to be retained, and will move away therefrom when it is lifted. The carriages 152 152 are connected to the ends of respective chains 155 155 passed around sprockets 156 156 keyed to a shaft 157 which is journalled on the structure 145 and is actuated by a motor reduce 158. The other ends of said chains are connected to counterweights 159 contained by stationary guides 160. Adjustable abutment 161 figure 34 control the bottom end of the stroke of said bar 151. With reference to figures 35 36 37 38 39, it will be noted that below said table 126, when positioned at the stations E of the installation, is provided a bed 162 with parallel co planar belts 163 which are directed as indicated by the arrow F2, the upper stretches of said belts being passed around respective rows of idle grooved rollers 164 supported by parallel frames 165 which are fixed to said bed 162. The belts 163, at their ends, are passed around pulleys 166 166 keyed to shafts rotatably supported by said bed 162, one of which is connected, through a sprocket and chain drive 167, to an oppositely rotatable motor reducer unit 168. The bed 162 is provided at the bottom with four vertical nut screws 169 arranged at the corners of an imaginary rectangle and co operating with respective lead screws 170 rotatably supported by a stationary frame 171 mounting an oppositely rotatable motor reducer unit 172 that, through a sprocket and chain drive 173, co operates with sprockets 174 keyed on said lead screws, the arrangement being such that upon activation of said unit 172 said bed with its belts will be raised and lowered, always in a perfectly horizontal condition. As shown also in figures 38 and 39, said bed 162 vertically movably mounts thereon, through four guide slide 175, an additional bed 176 which may be either raised or lowered with respect to the bed 162 by means of four suitably arranged fluid operated double acting cylinder and piston units 177. The bed 176 mounts frames 178 which are disposed parallelly and equally spaced between the frames 165 and are provided on the upper side thereof with co planar, parallel, idle wheels 179 which constitute a sliding plane in the direction of the arrow F2 of figure 1 and which, under command upon the activation of said units 177, may be positionaed at a higher or at a lower level with respect to the handling plane constituted by the belts 163. The components described above operate as follows. If the parallelepiped assembly of the stacks arranged previously on the table 126 is to be unloaded onto a pallet R or onto a protecting panel, the bed 162 is initially in its lower position and the bed 176 is also in its lowest position, whereby the powered belts 163 will move in the direction indicated in figure 1 by the arrows F4 and will introduce the pallet under the table 126, against comb like stationary abutments 180 see figures 35 36 40 . Upon this occurrence see also figure 26 , micro switches 181 181 will detect the appropriate presence of the front side of the pallet and communicate this presence to the programmer of the installation. The motion unit 172 is then operated and raises the bed 162 and the pallet R thereon. Prior to this operation, a feeler 182 see figure 4 carried by a rocking arm 183 controlled by a cylinder and piston unit 184 is moved from its rest position shown with broken lines to its active position shown with solid lines so that said feeler will engage the upper surface of the lowermost portion of the table 126 which, in the central area thereof, not supported by underlying members, forms a camber of few millimeters. The lifting movement of the pallet is automatically stopped when it engages said table 126 and brings the central area thereof on the planarity line 185, which causes the feeler 182 to be raised against the action of the spring 186 so as to trip a micro switch 187 to stop the motivating unit 172 figure 35 . Thereafter, said feeler 182 is moved back to its rest position away from the table 126. It is to be understood that the retractable feeler may be embodied otherwise or may be replaced by any other suitable means. The operation described above is effected at the beginning of the operative cycle of the stations E of the installation, when no stacks of panels have been transferred onto the table 126, so that when said transfer will be effected said table 126 will be supported thereunder due as well to the intimate bearing relationship with the pallet. When the table 126 is withdrawn from the station E and is translated temporarily to the adjoining station D, the assembly of stacks P , previously arranged on said table and held by the retaining bar 151, will be softly deposited onto the underlying pallet R. In the next step, the motion unit 172 will be re activated to lower the bed 162, whereafter said belts 163 are activated in the direction of the arrow F2 figures 35 1 to transfer the assembly of pallet and stacks to a station G which will be described hereinafter. If the assembly of stacks is to be discharged from the station E with no underlying protection, the installation operates as follows. The feeler 182 of figure 41 remains in its rest position, the bed 176 with the rollers 179 is raised so as to emerge from the plane of the now stopped belts 163, whereafter the main bed 162 is lifted to an extent which is controlled by a stationary sensor not shown whereby the rollers 179 will substantially bengage the undersurface of the table 126. When the table 126 is withdrawn from the station E, the assembly of stacks orderly arranged thereon and retained by the bar 151 will be deposited onto the bed with the rollers 179 that have efficiently supported said table throughout the operative cycle. In the next step, the bed with the rollers is lowered so that the assembly of stacks will be deposited on the plane formed by the belts 163, whereafter the general bed 162 is lowered to bring the belts in line with the station G, which is necessary for discharging said assembly of stacks. With reference to figures 1 42 43 44 45 46, it will be noted that the stations G G G G are equipped with common co planar parallel rollers 188 which are disposed with their longitudinal axes in the direction of the arrow F2 and are arranged on an imaginary horizontal plane located appropriately below the plane formed by the belts 163 of the station E when it is in the lower position thereof. The rollers 188 are supported by a stationary frame 189, are provided at an end thereof with sprockets 190 of the same diameter and, through additional idle sprockets 190 , are connected to a single chain 191 driven by a motor reducer unit 192 figure 43 , the arrangement being such that said rollers will move the articles deposited thereon, in the direction indicated by the arrows F5 in figure 1. At each station G G G G there are provided respective beds 193 193 193 193 vertically guided by suitable guide slide means 194 figure 46 and either raised and lowered by fluid operated cylinder and piston units 195. Mounted on said beds are frames 196 positioned parallelly between the rollers 188 and equally spaced therefrom, each frame having mounted thereon small, idle, grooved wheels 197 supporting the upper stretch of belts 198 passed around end pulleys 199 199 which are keyed on respective shafts 200 200 one of which is connected to an oppositely rotatable motivating unit 201. The linear speed of the belts 198 is the same as that of the belts 163 of the stations E. The frame 193 is normally in a lifted up condition so as to present lifted up belts 198 above the rollers 188. In this condition the belts 198, suitably moved in the direction of the arrow F4, will first introduce the pallet or panel R into the stations E of the plant, and thereafter, by a movement in the direction of the arrow F2, will withdraw from said stations E said pallet or panel having thereon the assembly of stacks, or the simple parallelepiped assembly of stacks of panels. The beds 193 with the belts 198 are then lowered whereby the assemblies of stacks with, if desired, a pallet or panel at the bottom will be deposited onto the rollers 188 which, when activated, will discharge said assemblies in the direction indicated by the arrow F5. Downstream of the transport runway formed by the rollers 188 there may be provided a strapping station or a plastics film wrapping station, or any other means for collecting and disposing the articles processed by the plant according to the invention. The pallets or, if desired, the protecting panels R are inserted into the stations G from respective stations H H H H comprising powered belts which are co planar and in line with respect to those of the belts 198 of said stations G when in the raised working position thereof, and which are moved at the same speed and in the direction of the arrow F4. No further constructional details of the stations H of the installation are illustrated here, since they are obvious and easily construed by those skilled in the art. The activation of the stations H may beeither manual or, advantageously, automated. It is to be understood that this description relates to a preferred embodiment of the invention, omitting the constructional details concerning the various control and safety circuits of the plant, as well as the various electrical circuits and fluid operated circuits, since they are easily conceivable and can be easily constructed by those skilled in the art.
