# Process for manufacturing a motor vehicle windscreen.

## Abstract
Process for manufacturing a safety motor vehicle wind screen, more especially as regards lower formation of glass fragments in the event of impact or fracture of said wind screen. The process consists in coating the inside surface of said windscreen with a liquid composition, which, after curing with ultra violet and infrared rays, forms a high strength, hard and flexible film. The coating is prepared so that, during the curing pro cess, a polyurethane of aliphatic polycaprolactone is formed as an interpenetrating network system, with a partially cross linked vinylacrylic copolymer, the whole being formed in the presence of a controlled quantity of a polyester urethane acry late prepolymer.
