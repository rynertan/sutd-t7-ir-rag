# A VALVE APPARATUS

## Abstract
A valve including a valve body 26 having an end wall 27 , a side wall 28 and a retaining ring 33 that together define a valve chamber 36 . The end wall defines a valve inlet opening 29 communicating with the chamber and an annu lar valve seat 48 within the chamber encircles the valve inlet opening. Defined in the side wall are a plurality of valve outlet openings 31 communicating with the chamber. A resilient, annular seal 45 is disposed within the valve chamber and encircles the valve inlet opening. Retained within the valve chamber by the valve body is a bi metalic disc 35 substan tially parallel to the valve seat and normally spaced therefrom by a distance greater than the thickness of the annular seal. The disc responds to a predetermined ambient temperature by deflecting concavely into the valve chamber and into fluid sealing engagement with one end of the annular seal, an opposite end thereof being in fluid sealing engagement the valve seat.
