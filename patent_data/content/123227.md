# SINGLE LEVER FAUCET ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A single lever faucet assembly having a faucet control lever which is reversibly mountable laterally on either side of the faucet spout without having to switch positioning of the hot and cold water supply lines thereto. The faucet assembly includes a valve cartridge which may be easily disconnected from the faucet control lever and removed from the faucet base for replacement. The valve cartridge is arranged and disposed to provide a straight through flow path from the hot and cold water supply lines to the faucet spout which is free of any obstructions, thereby maximizing outlet flow rates. The faucet assembly further includes a means for independently controlling discharge temperature and flow rate by separate patterned movement of the faucet control lever so as to provide uniform temperature regulation at any flow rate.
