## Description
This invention relates to a liquid fuel cell providing a stable operation for a prolonged time under controlled supply of fuel and water. Generally, fuel cells using a liquid fuel are classified into an acid type and an alkali type, and methanol, formalin, hydrazine, etc. are used as fuels. The working principle of such fuel cells will be briefly described with reference to Fig. 1 which is a schematic representation of a prior art fuel cell for showing the operational principle thereof. This fuel cell The fuel cell as structured above works as follows. When the fuel is supplied to the fuel chamber On the other hand, when the oxidizing agent is supplied to the oxidizing agent chamber When an aqueous electrolyte solution such as sulfuric acid or potassium hydroxide solution is used in the electrolyte chamber It has also been proposed to use an aqueous solution of a polymeric electrolyte in the electrolyte chamber As shown in Fig. 2, the product gas According to the conventional fuel supply system as described above, a fuel mixture in a constant mixing ratio prepared in advance is supplied to the circulating system from the single fuel tank In a fuel cell using a liquid fuel, the fuel supply system contains two essential components, i.e. fuel and water, and further may contain an electrolyte. In most cases, these three components, i.e. fuel, water and electrolyte, are usually contained in the fuel supply system. Among these three components, fuel and water are consumed. Usually, it is not necessary to take the consumption of electrolyte into consideration. The consumption rate of fuel differs from that of water, because firstly water is always consumed at one electrode, whereas at the other electrode water is always formed as a result of the electrochemical reaction, and the formation of water at the fuel electrode or the oxidation electrode, depends on the acidity or the alkalinity of the electrolyte. That is, in the case of an acidic electrolyte, water is formed at the oxidation electrode and consumed at the fuel electrode, whereas in the case of an alkaline electrolyte, the formation and consumption of water are reversed. In that case, one mole to two moles of water are formed in principle per mole of fuel in the electrochemical reactions, depending on the kind of fuel used. Since the consumption and formation of water take place at different electrodes, water actually tends to migrate through the electrolyte chamber Secondly, the excess or shortage of water due to water imbalance by water migration between the electrodes largely depends on the operating temperature and the load current. Thirdly, the excess fuel that is not oxidized with generation of electric current at the fuel electrode migrates through the electrolyte chamber and permeates into the oxidation electrode to undergo direct oxidation or water migrates as hydronium ions when the electrolyte ions migrate in the electrolyte chamber in the case of an acidic electrolyte. These phenomena also depend on the load current and the operating temperature of a fuel cell. Furthermore, the amount of water carried by the oxidizing agent, for example, air by evaporation at the oxidation electrode side depends on the feed rate, the temperature and the humidity of the oxidizing agent. The consumption rate of fuel differs from that of water on the grounds as described above, and thus the supply of a mixture of fuel and water only in a constant mixing ratio from a single tank to the fuel circulation system as shown in Fig. 2 can only compensate for a change in the amount of only one component among the two components, i.e. fuel and water, in the fuel circulation system including the fuel chamber. That is, adequate control concerning both fuel and water cannot be made, and a stable and prolonged operation of such a fuel cell is quite impossible to achieve. That is, the fuel in the fuel circulation system may be so concentrated that much heat is generated or the current output is lowered, or the supply of fuel fails to compensate for the consumption, so that fuel shortage occurs in the fuel system. In a fuel cell using a liquid fuel, the cell voltage shows a flat peak in a certain range of the concentration C The appropriate range of the fuel concentration, i.e. the range of fuel concentration between C On the other hand, even for a liquid fuel cell using hydrazine as fuel, JP B 48 31300 discloses that stable operation is possible at a concentration of 1,5 by mass 0,5 mol l , and if the concentration is less than 1,5 by mass, the voltage is lowered, and the temperature is increased. It is taken from the foregoing that the fuel concentration range for stable operation is between about 0,3 mol l C Thus, the fuel concentration is very important in the fuel cell, and an accurate apparatus for detecting or measuring the fuel concentration is required. A liquid fuel cell provided with an apparatus for detecting the fuel concentration now in practical use is shown in Fig. 4, where the same components as in Fig 5.1 and Fig. 2 are indicated with the same reference numerals. An oxidizing agent is supplied to the oxidizing agent chamber Fuel is supplied by opening the valve The detector With such a structure as described above, when a DC voltage of e.g. 0,85 V is applied between the anode However, although the fuel concentration can be determined by an apparatus such as described above, its detection sensitivity is not very good as will be explained below. The relationship between the fuel concentration and the detected electric current is shown in Fig. 12, where curve Furthermore, the adhesion between the anode plate Cyclic voltammetry using a reference electrode and an apparatus for detecting the fuel concentration by means of a small fuel cell is disclosed in JP A1 56 118273. In the case of cyclic voltammetry, a reference electrode is required in addition to the detecting electrodes, and also a function generator and other devices are required,thus complicating the detecting system and deteriorating the reliability, the most important task of the fuel concentration detector. In the case of the apparatus using a small fuel cell, not only the apparatus is to be provided in the anolyte tank, but also an additional air supply system is required, and accordingly a reduction of the apparatus size is difficult, and the reliability is reduced. In the case of using methanol or formalin as fuel rather than using hydrazine as fuel, the detected power output changes in a complicated manner even when detected by means of cyclic voltammetry, and determination is sometimes difficult. There is an alternative procedure for controlling the fuel supply when the integrated load current becomes constant, since the fuel concentration is proportional to the load current, but when the load is greatly changed, or the operation of the fuel cell is subject to repetitions of discontinuation, the fuel concentration will greatly deviate and cannot be practically determined via the load current. On the other hand, a semiconductor based gas concentration sensor requires much time until it is ready for measurement, and thus the response is poor. JP A1 58 165274 discloses a methanol water fuel cell having improved operational stability which comprises two independent tanks, one of which being provided for water and one for methanol, which are connected via valves controlled by a controller to an anolyte circulation system. The liquid fuel level in the fuel chamber is monitored by means of a level sensor connected to the controller. Further, a thermometer is provided in the fuel chamber and connected to the controller which independently supplies fuel and water from the respective tanks by means of the valves into the anolyte. This prior art device, however, suffers from the same principal disadvantages as discussed above, particularly with respect to the detection of the fuel concentration in the anolyte. Accordingly, there was a strong demand for a liquid fuel cell comprising a reliable apparatus for detecting the fuel concentration on the basis of a simple structure. It is the object of the present invention is to provide a liquid fuel cell with improved supply of fuel and water to a fuel circulation system which can operate continuously and stably for a prolonged time, and wherein the different consumption rates of fuel and water are taken into account in the control system. This liquid fuel cell should be provided with an apparatus for detecting the fuel concentration with high reliability and high sensitivity which has a simple structure. This object is achieved according to claim 1. The dependent claims relate to prefered embodiments. The liquid fuel cell according to the present invention comprises The dosage means are preferably valves or pumps. According to a prefered embodiment, the first tank is provided to contain water rich fuel water mixture having a molar ratio of fuel to water of not more than 1, and the second tank is provided to contain fuel rich fuel water mixture having a molar ratio of water to fuel of not more than 5. The fuel is preferably methanol. It is advantageous to provide water recovering means for recovering water discharged from the oxidizing agent chamber into the first tank, preferably a water recovery trap. In accordance with another prefered embodiment, the detector is detecting the fuel concentration by electrochemical reactions and comprises an anode consisting of an anode plate provided with a catalyst layer and a fuel controlling layer provided thereon and having a controlled fuel permeability, a cathode electrode, a power source and a current detector connected in series to the anode and the cathode being dipped in the fuel mixture. The anode of the fuel cell according to the invention preferably has a second fuel controlling layer provided on the fuel controlling layer According to another prefered embodiment, the cathode of the fuel cell comprises a cathode plate other than a platinum plate, and a catalyst layer provided thereon an electroconductive porous layer is provided between the cathode plate other than a platinum plate and the catalyst layer. The fuel controlling layer is preferably made of a carbon fiber paper obtained by treating with a suspension of fine polytetrafluoroethylene particles and subsequent baking, or of a porous carbon sheet, of a sintered metal, of insulating sintered ceramics or of an organic porous material. The catalyst layer provided on one side of the fuel controlling layer is preferably made by kneading a platinum based catalyst with a suspension of fine polytetrafluoroethylene particles, applying the mixture to one side of the fuel controlling layer and subsequent baking. The anode plate is advantageously of tantalum. According to a prefered embodiment of the present invention, the detector for detecting the fuel concentration by means of electrochemical reactions comprises an anode provided with a fuel controlling layer of controlled fuel permeability for controlling the permeation of fuel through the catalyst layer, a cathode, a power source and a current detector, the anode and the cathode being in contact with the fuel mixture, and a voltage being applied to the electrodes. Fuel cannot be too concentrated in the fuel circulation system, because at a higher fuel concentration, excess fuel is liable to permeate into the oxidation electrode from the fuel electrode through the electrolyte chamber, and to undergo direct oxidation, i.e. direct consumption, which leads to a considerable lowering of the fuel utilization efficiency. Usually, the fuel concentration in the fuel circulation system is about 0,3 to about 2 mol l, and the absolute amount of fuel in the fuel circulation system is small. Thus, in the present invention a fuel concentration detector is used to detect the fuel concentration in the fuel circulation system and to control the supply fuel, or a detector detecting the output voltage or the output current of the fuel cell are used, because the output voltage or current is reduced as fuel concentration is lowered. When the detected value becomes lower than the standard concentration, a signal to open the dosage means of the fuel tank is emitted to supply fuel into the fuel circulation system. A considerably large amount of water is present in the fuel circulation system, and thus it is preferable to supply the water to the fuel circulation system after checking whether a predetermined amount of water is retained in the fuel circulation system or not. To this end, a liquid level sensor is provided in the fuel circulation system of the fuel cell to detect whether the liquid level becomes lower than the standard level or not. When the detected liquid level is lower than the predetermined level, a signal to open the dosage means of the tank containing the water rich mixture is emitted to supply water to the fuel circulation system. In the present invention, two tanks are provided both storing mixtures of fuel and water. When only fuel is supplied to the fuel circulation system from a pure fuel tank, a local and transient higher fuel concentration may occur in the fuel circulation system due to the restricted circulation rate, thus undesirably lowering the fuel utilization efficiency. This problem is solved according to the invention by storing a fuel rich mixture of fuel and water in the fuel tank. The preferable molar ratio of water to fuel in the fuel rich mixture is not more than 5. Furthermore, it is preferable to select a ratio approximating the average ratio of the consumption rate of water to that of fuel during the operation of the fuel cell. When only water is supplied to the fuel circulation system from a pure water tank, a lower fuel concentration may likewise locally and transiently occur in the fuel circulation system due to the restricted circulation rate, and a local fuel shortage may develop, thus lowering the performance of the fuel cell. The problem is solved according to the invention by storing a water rich mixture of fuel and water in the water tank. The prefered molar ratio of fuel to water in the water rich mixture is not more than 1,0. It is preferable to select a ratio approximating the fuel concentration in the fuel circulation system in the fuel cell. In the following, the invention will be explained with reference to Figs.6 to 12, One embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Fig. 6, which relates to a liquid fuel cell using methanol as fuel and sulfuric acid as electrolyte. The electrodes Air is supplied to an oxidizing agent chamber A level sensor A fuel concentration detector In a liquid fuel cell with the construction of Fig. 6 and having a power output of 100 W at a voltage of 12 V, the circulation rate of the anolyte in the fuel circulation system is set to 700 ml min, and about 30 ml of water are supplied to the fuel circulation system from the first tank The fuel concentration during operation of the fuel cell is not necessarily 1 mol l, and operation at a higher fuel concentration is possible, if the load current is relatively large, and alternatively, operation at a lower fuel concentration is also possible, if the load current is relatively small. For setting the fuel concentration, the set electric current must be changed, because the electric current is a function of the fuel concentration according to the constant voltage system when detection on the basis of the electrochemical reaction is utilized. As described above, the liquid fuel cell with two tanks according to the invention can be stably operated independently of fluctuations of the load current, the operating temperature or other external conditions. Another embodiment of the present invention will be described below, referring to Fig. 7, where, when the liquid level is detected lower by the liquid level sensor In place of measuring the fuel concentration in the fuel circulation system, such a phenomenon that the output voltage is lowered as the fuel concentration is decreased can be also utilized. To this end, a detector Since in this embodiment, both tanks A further embodiment of the present invention is shown in Fig. 8, where the the fuel cell as such corresponds to that of Fig. 7 with the difference that a signal for supplying a fuel rich mixture from the tank In the foregoing embodiments, liquid fuel cells using methanol as fuel and an acidic electrolyte have been described, but the present invention is readily applicable also to alkaline type liquid fuel cells using methanol as fuel, and other liquid fuel cells using hydrazine, formaldehyde, etc. as fuels by providing the fuel cell with two tanks and appropriately selecting fuel water ratios of the fuel mixtures in the tanks, as described above. When an apparatus for detecting the fuel concentration according to the following embodiments is used in the present liquid fuel cell, the effects of the present liquid fuel cell can be further improved, as described below. Fig. 9 is a schematic representation of an apparatus That is, resin coats or pad plates of bakelite or glass are laid on all other sides than the fuel controlling layer In a practical test of the apparatus of Fig. 9 electrode area 4cm¬≤ voltage 0,9 V fuel permeation through the fuel controlling layer The material of the fuel controlling layer In Fig. 10, another embodiment of the present invention is shown, where two fuel controlling layers In Fig. 11, a further embodiment of the present invention is shown, where the cathode The liquid fuel cells according to the present invention can be stably and efficiently operated for a prolonged time in spite of different consumption rates of fuel and water even if the load current or the operating temperature of the fuel cell or the temperature or humidity of the atmosphere are changed. Further, according to a prefered embodiment of the present invention, an anode having a fuel controlling layer deposited thereon through the intermediate of a catalyst layer is used for detecting the fuel concentration, and thus no liquid fuel stagnation occurs between the anode and the fuel controlling layer, thus improving the permeation of liquid fuel and activating the reaction between the electrodes as well as improving the detection sensitivity and response and accordingly the reliability of the apparatus.
