# Galling and wear resistant steel alloy.

## Abstract
A chromium nickel silicon manganese steel alloy con sisting essentially of about 1.0 maximum carbon, from 10 to about 16 manganese, about 0.07 maximum phosphor us, about 0.1 maximum sulfur, 4 to 6 silicon, 4 to 6 chromium, 4 to about 6 nickel, about 0.05 maximum nitrogen, and balance essentially iron. Preferred embodi ments exhibit excellent galling resistance, metal to metal wear resistance, high impact strength, oxidation resistance and corrosion resistance.
