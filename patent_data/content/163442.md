# Process for the preparation of esters of dicarboxylic acids.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of an ester of dicarboxylic acid from an alkene, carbon monoxide is provided. The process is catalysed by a catalyst which comprises a platinum group metal, for example palladium, and a copper compound. To avoid catalyst deactivation the process is carried out in the presence of a dihydrocarbyl peroxide which is reduced to a hydrocarbyl alcohol under the process conditions. The process can be used, for example, to prepare succinate esters from ethylene, carbon monoxide an alcohol and dihydrocarbyl peroxide such as di tertiary butyl perox ide.
