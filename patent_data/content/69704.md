# Monolithic multiple electrode capacitor structures.

## Abstract
The multiple electrode monolithic capacitor structures employ a multigap series construction embedded within a single dielectric material 56 . A plurality of aligned spaced apart electrodes 50, 52 and 54 are spaced apart across the material 56 with gaps formel between each pair of electrodes. Each gap area is bridged by a respective floating electrode 58 and 60 separated by a gap from each pair of spaced apart electrodes. The voltage rating of such capacitors increases with each gap added across the dielectric. Additionally, the amount of piezoelectric activity occurring in a piezoelectric dielectric is limited by the series gap arrangement to be below that which causes deleterious spurious signals to be generated when said capacitor vibrates.
