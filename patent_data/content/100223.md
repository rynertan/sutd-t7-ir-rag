# Combinatorial weighing methods and apparatus.

## Abstract
In a combinatorial weighing method and apparatus, a plu rality of weighing machines 1 l...1 n are supplied with articles to be weighed, different combinations of the weighing ma chines are found such that each of these combinations would give a batch of articles having a combined weight value equal or close to a preselected target weight value, and an optimum combination is selected from these combinations. The articles are discharged from the weighing machines corresponding to this optimum combination to provide a desired batch. The opti mum combination should be one which gives a combination of articles the combined weight value whereof has the smallest error, with respect to the target weight value and within preset allowable limits, whilst also being such that the statistical dispersion of weight values from the weighing machines which do not participate in that combination has a value that is equal to or greater than a predetermined tolerance. The latter crite rion can serve to improve the efficiency of a process including repetition of such a weighing method.
