# Process for the preparation of hydroxybenzaldehydes.

## Abstract
An improved Reimer Tiemann reaction for the prepara tion of salicylaldehyde and p hydroxybenzaldehydes by reacting an aqueous alkalin solution of phenol with chlor oform in the presence of a cationic, amphoteric or anionic phase transfer catalyst.
