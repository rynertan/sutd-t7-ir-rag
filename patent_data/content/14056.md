# An atomizer wheel for the atomization of liquids.

## Abstract
In an atomizer wheel for the atomization of liquids by ejection through a number of orifices 10 in the side wall 4 of the wheel, whipping in of air into the atomized liquid is reduced by provision of a protrusion around the leading edge of each orifice relative to the direction 17 of rota tion, whereby the liquid layer flowing backwards relative to the side wall is guided outside the leading edge of the ori fice to a liquid inlet passage 16 at the rear part of the ejection orifice relative to the direction of rotation. The protrusion may be formed by a bushing 11 inserted in the ejection orifice and projecting inwardly from the side wall, at the rear side of which relative to the direction of rotation the inlet passage 16 is formed as a slit.
