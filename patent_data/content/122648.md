## Description
Method for the manufacture of urethane modified isocyanurate foamsThis invention pertains to the formation of urethane modified isocyanurate foams using mixtures of polyalkoxylated amines and polyalkoxylated quaternary ammonium borate esters as copolyols. More particularly this invention relates to the use of such copolyols to form foams having NCO OH ratios of 1.5 to 3.5, using very inexpensive, commercially available resin polyols. A blend of these polyalkoxylated amines and polyalkoxylated quaternary ammonium borate esters with the aforesaid resin polyol and, optionally, a polyether or polyester polyol is very stable and will remain a homogeneous liquid without phase separation and without the need for agitation for at least 7 days after blending.Urethane and polyisocyanate foams are manufactured using a blend of an isocyanate and a polyol. The molar ratio of isocyanate to polyol, that is, the ratio of NCO functional groups to OH functional groups, is known as the index or NCO OH ratio . Foams are manufactured with both isocyanates and polyols and when the molar ratio of isocyanate to polyol is between 1.05 to 1.15, a urethane foam is formed according to the reaction EMI1.1 The urethane product shown above is the monomeric structural unit that combines to form the polyurethane foam. At an index between 1.5 and 3.5, a urethane modified isocyanurate foam is formed. At indices above 4.1, an isocyanurate foam is formed having the monomeric unit EMI1.2 which may have a minority of urethane linkages.Herein, the terms isocyanurate and polyisocyanurate and the terms urethane and polyurethane in reference to foams will be used interchangably.Currently, urethane modified polyisocyanurate foams are manufactured u sing polyether or polyester polyols, as for example the Vorano 0 group of polyols available from Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Michigan. When combined with a catalyst, a surfactant, and a blowing agent, and then with an isocyanate in the known manner, these polyether or polyester polyols form a foam having good qualities. Certain resin polyols, such as the Terate resin polyol available from Hercules, Incorporated, Wilmington, Delaware, the D 400 Polyol resin polyol available from DixieChemical Company, 10701 Bay Area Boulevard, Pasadena, Texas, and theFoamol 250 resin polyols available from Jim Walter Research Corporation, 10301 9th St. North, St. Petersburg, Florida, are of a hydroxyl number sufficient so as to theoretically permit their use in foam manufacture.In practice, however, these polyols have proved to be unacceptable at concentrations in excess of 40 wt. of the total polyol blend for use in manufacturing high quality urethane modified polyisocyanurate foams.Because the resin polyols are about one third less costly than the currently used conventional polyether or polyester polyols, it is desirable that a polyol blend be found that may be used with larger quantities of such resin polyols to result in a polyisocyanurate foam having acceptable properties and at a lower cost.The present invention is a method for the manufacture of urethane modified polyisocyanurate foams, comprising blending an isocyanate with a B side, the B side comprising a polyol blend, a surfactant, a blowing agent, and a catalyst. The polyol blend comprises a. at least 5 wt. of a mixture of a polyalkoxylated amine and a poly alkoxylated quaternary ammonium borate ester b. at least 40 wt. of a resin polyol, said resin polyol comprising at least 70 wt. of a combination of polymers and monomers having the general formula EMI3.1 wherein n is between 0 and 50, R11 is either H or CH3 , and p and q are each integers between 1 and 10 or at least 45 wt. of a resin polyol, said resin polyol either having the general formulaEMI3.2 wherein n is either 1 or 2 and x is an integer between 1 and 20, inclusive or having the general formulaEMI3.3 wherein n is an integer between 1 and 4 inclusive and x and y are in tegers each having a value of between 2 and 20, inclusive c. the remainder of said polyol blend being a polyether or polyester polyol.All of the components of the B side may be blended and will thereafter remain a homogeneous liquid without phase separation and without the need for agitation for at least seven days. In one embodiment of the invention the weight ratio of polyalkoxylated amine to polyalkoxylated quaternary ammonium borate ester is between 1 0.15 and 1 12.0 when use is made of resin polyol comprising at least 70 wt. of a compound having the general formula I .In another embodiment of the invention the weight ratio of polyalkoxylated amine to polyalkoxylated quaternary ammonium borate ester is between 1 0.15 and 1 4.1 when use is made of resin polyol having the general formula II or III .In yet another embodiment of the invention, the polyalkoxylated amine is selected from the group consisting of EMI4.1 wherein R is selected from the group of alkyl radicals having between 1 and 18 carbon atoms, x and y are integers each having a value of at least one and wherein the sum of x and y does not exceed 50 and wherein R and R2 may be the same or different and may be selected from the groups consisting of H , CH3 , C1 C10 straight or branched chain alkyl or alkenyl radicals, a phenyl group, a benzyl group or halogenated alkyl group. In a most preferred polyalkoxylated amine, R corresponds to the tallow alkyl group, R1 and R2 are each H , and x plus y equal 5.Hence, the preferred polyalkoxylated amine is a tallow penta ethoxylated amine.In a still further embodiment of the invention, the polyalkoxylated quaternary ammonium borate esters are of the general formula EMI5.1 wherein R3 is a straight or branched chain alkyl or alkenyl radical having from 1 to 30 carbon atoms, inclusive, or a phenyl or benzyl radical R4 is H , a C1 to C10 straight or branched chain alkyl or alkenyl radical, a phenyl group, a benzyl group, or a halogenated alkyl group R5 and R6 are different or the same and are selected from the group including H , or a C1 to C10 straight or branchedchain alkyl or alkenyl radical, a phenyl group, or a benzyl group and wherein m is an integer between 0 to 30, inclusive.Preferably, the polyalkoxylated quaternary ammonium borate ester will include an R3 that is a straight or branched chain alkyl or alkenyl radical having from 8 to 18 carbon atoms, and R4, R5, R6 will be H .

A preferred polyisocyanate is Mondu MR, a polycyclic aromatic polyisocyanate available from the Mobay Chemical Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Present urethane modified polyisocyanurate foams may be manufactured according to methods known in the art. These methods comprise blending two components, stirring, and allowing the blend to rise in an open container so as to form the desired foam. The two components are known as the A and B components, with the AW component comprising the isocyanate and the B component comprising a blend of polyol, catalyst, surfactant, and blowing agent.Catalysts may be selected from those conventionally used in the art, including metal salts, alkali metal salts, and tertiary amine trimerization catalysts.

Surfactants may likewise be chosen from among those known to the skilled in the art a preferred surfactant is DC 193, a surfactant having silicon glycol copolymers with a direct silicon carbon bonds, and sold by the Dow Corning Corporation, Midland, Michigan.The present polyol blends may be obtained by mixing in a container the polyalkoxylated amine, polyalkoxylated quaternary ammonium borate ester, resin polyol, and optionally, the polyether or polyester polyol. The polyalkoxylated amines may include polyethoxylated or polvpropoxylated amines, wherein the amines are tertiary amines having one fatty alkyl group derived from various fatty sources and two or more polyoxyethylene or polyoxypropylene groups attached to the nitrogen. Typical of these polyethoxylated or polypropoxylated amines are the Ethomeene polyethoxylated amines available from the Armak Company, 300 S.Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois, 60606, preferably being of the general formula EMI7.1 wherein R is selected from the group of alkyl radicals having between 1 and 18 carbon atoms, x and y are integers each having a value of one or more, the sum of x and y not exceeding 50 and wherein R1 and R2 may be the same or different, and may be selected from the groups consisting of H , CH3 , Cl Cl0 straight or branched chain alkyl or alkenyl radicals, a phenyl group, a benzyl group or halogenated alkyl group. Another preferred polyalkoxylated amine includes the compound Ethomeen EA 80 polyethoxylated ether amine, which is manufactured by the combination of a C8 and C10 branched chain alcohol and which is also available from the Armak Company, Chicago, Illinois.These preferred ether amines are selected from the group consisting of EMI7.2 wherein R7 is selected from the group of C1 C20 alkyl groups, andR8 is a C2 to C5 alkyl group R1 and R2 are the same or different and may be selected from the groups consisting of H , CH3 , C1 to C10 straight or branched chain alkyl or alkenyl radicals, a phenyl group, a benzyl group, or a halogenated alkyl group and x and y are in tegers each having a value of at least 1 and having a sum not exceeding 50.Also required for the polyol blend are polyalkoxylated quaternary ammonium borate esters.

With respect to the resin polyol of which at least 70 by weight will be a compound having the general formula I , at least 40 by weight of the polyol blend will comprise this resin polyol. Examples of these resin polyols include the Te rate 200 series resin polyols for rigid and semi rigid polyurethane foam described in Bulletin OR 255 of Hercules, Inc., Wilmington, Delaware 19899, and the above formula I is believed to be an accurate structural representation of about 70 of the weight of the Terates resin polyols. The Terates resin polyols are general purpose, moderate viscosity, aro matic polyester polyols derived from polycarbomethoxy substituted di phenyls, polyphenyls, and benzyl esters of the toluate family. The Terate z polyols are dark colored, highly polar liquids that are insolu ble in aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents and water.Product grades and typical properties are as follows TABLE 1Product Grade Viscosity at Hydroxy Acid Number as Water, Average 25 C, cps Number Carboxylic Acid Percent Equivalent Weight Terate 202 1,900 440 4.5 0.1 127.5 Terate 203 19,000 315 5.1 0.1 i78 Terate 204 13,000 275 6 0.1 204 Terate 211 18,000 540 3 0.1 104 Teratet 2i3 30,000 315 3 0.1 178 alat 40 C A most preferred Terate 0 resin polyol for use in the present invention is Terates 203 resin polyol.

The D 400 and the Foamol 250 resin polyols are dark colored, highly polar liquids that are insoluble in aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents and water. The remainder of the polyol blend, if the total polyol blend will not be limited to the polyalkoxylated amine, polyalkoxylated quaternary ammonium borate ester, and resin polyol, will be a conventional polyether or poly ester polyol. These polyether or polyester polyols are well known in the art of polyurethane and polyisocyanurate foam manufacture, as for example the Voranol polyether polyols manufactured by the Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Michigan. A most preferred polyether or polyester polyol is Voranolt 575.The particular polyol blend in accordance with this invention is advantageous in that all of the components of the B side may be blended together with a polyol blend and the BX side will thereafter remain a homogeneous liquid without phase separation and without the need for agitation for at least 7 days, and may still be used to manufacture a foam having excellent physical properties.There are several criteria to be noted in determining whether a foam is of an acceptable quality. Of lesser importance is the tack free time, which is preferably about 60 seconds or less. Dimensional stability is more important, and the foam should not exceed 115 of its original dimensions after seven days. Dimensional stability is tested at two conditions 700C and 100t relative humidity and 930C and ambient humidity.Another important criterion is the percentage of closed cells in the foam itself, with a minimum of 85 required. Finally, a percent friability, the loss of weight of the polyisocyanurate foam due to crumbling, is determined by the ASTM C 421 test. The friability of a foam is good if under 20 and excellent if under 10 .The following examples will demonstrate the use of the present polyol blend in the manufacture of polyisocyanurate foams using low cost resin polyols. The first four examples pertain to the manufacture of the particular mixture of a polyalkoxylated amine and a polyalkoxylated quaternary ammonium borate ester. These mixtures are used in this invention in an amount comprising at least 5 wt. of the polyol blend.ExamPle 1 304 grass of 1,2 propanediol 4.0 gram moles are added to 124 grams of boric acid 2.0 gram moles in a one liter, three neck flask equipped with a heating mantle, a Dean Stark trap, and a condenser. The mixture is heated to 1280C at atmospheric pressure, and retained at that temperature and pressure for about 3 1 2 hours, during which time 44.5 grams of water was stripped from the mixture. A water aspirator is then started to create a slight vacuum at the condenser, and another 65.0 grams of water is stripped from the mixture during the next 5 3 4 hours. The total water removed 109.5 grams corresponds to the stoichiometric amount, but analysis of the borate ester adduct remaining in the flask showed that it contained 3.48 water.40 grams 0.25 gram moles of the borate ester formed are added to 262 grams 1.0 gram mole of Armeen TM 97 aliphatic amine, so as to obtain a 1 0.25 ratio of amine to borate ester, and 58.1 grams diethylene glycol, a solvent. After heating the reaction mixture to 750C, 121.0 grams 2.75 gram moles of ethylene oxide are added thereto over the next 2 1 2 hours. Analysis of the resulting mixture showed a blend containing 45.4 free amine and 36.7 of a quaternary ammonium propylene glycol borate ester having the formula EMI11.1 This formula corresponds to Armol l0lB 3 polyethoxylated amine ammonium borate ester blend.Example 2A 100 gallon Monel reactor was charged with 84 kg 0.71 mole of Armeen TM 97 aliphatic amine and 13.6 kg of diethylene glycol, and the mixture was heated to 650C. Over a two hour period, 38.5 kg 0.53 mole of the bis propylene glycol borate ester described in Example 1 was pumped into the reactor, causing the temperature to rise to 80 C. After cooling to 750C, 60 kg 3.02 mole of ethylene oxide was added over a period of two hours and 42 minutes. During this time the total reactor pressure was not allowed to exceed 3.6 bar and the temperature was maintained at 950C. The mixture was allowed to digest for another 2 hours and 40 minutes, where upon analysis showed 1.317 meq g of quat and 0.307 meq g of free amine and 0.3 H2O. The reactor was purged with a stream of nitrogen at 75 850C for 4 hours and an additional 6 hours at 1000C. Analysis showed 0.11 H2O. This is Armol 101B 1. 12.6 kg of the 101B 1 and 48.6 kgs. Ethomeene T 15 were mixed in a 30 gallon Pfaudler reactor at 700C. Water was removed from the blend by sparging with a stream of nitrogen at 700C at 27 Hg vacuum over a 5 1 2 hour period. Analysis after this time showed quat 0.238 meq g, free amines 1.779 meg g, pH 10 in H2O 10.9, H2O 0.1 and OH value 318.This product corresponds to ArmolTM 201B 155 ArmolTM 201B 175 amine ammonium blend.Example 3 17.7 kg or ArmolTh l0lB l amine ammonium borate ester blend and 43.5 kg of Ethomeens T 15 ethoxylated amines was blended at 700C in a 30 gallonPfaudler reactor. Water was removed by sparging with a stream of nitrogen at 70 C, 27 Hg vacuum over 5 hours. Analysis showed quat 0.331 meq g, free amine 1.650 meq g, pH 10 in water 10.9, H2O 0.l , OH value Th 332. This product corresponds to Armol 201B 135 amine ammonium borate ester blend.ArmolTM 201B 145, ArmolTM 201B 155 and ArmolTM 201 175 amine ammonium borate ester blend are manufactured in the manner described above usingArmolTM 101B 1 Ethomeen T 15 ratios of 4.8 8.2, 5.9 7.1 and 9.3 5.7, respectively.Example 4 304 grams of 1,2 propane diol 4.0 gram moles are added to 124 grams of boric acid 2.0 gram moles in a one liter, three neck flask equipped with a heating mantle, a Dean Stark trap, and a condenser. The mixture is heated to 1280C at atmospheric pressure, and retained there for about 3 1 2 hours, during which time about 44.5 grams of water are stripped from the mixture. A water aspirator is then started so as to create a slight vacuum at the condenser, and another 65.0 grams of water is stripped from the mixture during the next 5 3 4 hours. The total water removed of 109.5 grams corresponds to the stoichiometric amount, but analysis of the adduct remaining in the flask showed that it contained 3.4 water. 160 grams 1.0 gram mole of this propylene glycol borate ester are added to 262 grams 1.0 gram mole of Armeens TMD aliphatic amine and 134 grams 1.0 gram mole of dipropylene glycol, a solvent. The reactor in which these reactants are blended is communicative with an ethylene oxide reservoir through a stainless steel tube. Four moles of ethylene oxide, pressurized in its reservoir by nitrogen, are slowly added to the reactor over the next 8 1 2 hours, and the resulting quaternary is represented by the formula EMI13.1 The product formed in the above ethoxylation comprises 48.6 of the ethoxylated quaternary ammonium borate ester shown above and 10.3 free amine, and corresponds to ArmolTM 101B 4 amine quaternary ammonium borate ester.ArmolTM 101B 2 amine quaternary ammonium borate ester may be manufactured by adding 75 grams 0.469 gram moles of the propylene glycol borate ester described in the first paragraph of this example to 246 grams 0.939 gram moles Armeen TM 97, and 35 grams of diethylene glycol, and then ethoxylating this blend with 144 grams 4.0 gram moles of ethylene oxide in the manner described in the second paragraph of this example.The ratios of free amine to quaternary in the presently used amine quaternary ammonium borate ester blend are as follows Amine quaternary ammonium Ratio, free amines borate ester blend quatArmolTM 101B 1 1 4.06 101B 2 1 1.51 101B 3 1 0.54 101B 4 1 11.6 TM Armol 201B 125 1 0.15 201B 135 1 0.23 201B 145 1 0.35 201B 155 1 0.49 201B 175 1 0.86 Example 5A urethane modified polyisocyanurate foam was manufactured by blending 170.3 grams of Mondur BR with a B side comprising 20 grams of Armo r 201B 125, 67.5 grams Terate 203, 12.5 grams Voranol 575, 2.5 grams DowCorning DC l93, and 41 grams Freon llA.The resulting foam had a cream time of 24 seconds, a gel time of 46 seconds, a tack free time of 69 seconds, a density of 0.033 gram per cc., a 1.21 friability, 88.3 closed cells, was at 109.41 of its original dimensions after seven days at 700C and 100 relative humidity, and was at 106.81 of its original dimensions after seven days at 930C and the ambient relative humidity.Examples 6 9Urethane modified diisocyanurate foams were manufactured in substantially the same manner set forth in Example 5, except that instead of Armof 2015 125, other amine guaternary ammonium borate ester blends were used in accordance with the data in Table 2 below. The reaction profile, densities, percent closed cells, and percent friability are also shown inTable 2.Example 10 E 11Urethane modified polyisocyanurate foams were prepared by blending 20 grams of a amine ammonium borate ester blend with Terate 203. The particular amine quaternary ammonium borate ester blend used and the reaction profiles and physical properties of the foams manufactured are disclosed in Table 3 below.Examples 12 14In the following examples, the B side, comprising the polyol blend, a surfactant, a blowing agent, and a catalyst were blended and allowed to stand without agitation for seven days. At the end of the seven days, the blends were observed to determine whether they had remained homoge neous. Non homogeneity, or phase separation of the B sides, which were stored in a sealed one pint jar on a shelf, could be easily determined by viewing the blend. Upon phase separation, the Bw side would be seen to contain separate and distinct layers. The results are listed in Table 4 those samples showing homogeneity are indicated by the word yes in the row entitled One Week Stability .Example 15This example is substantially similar to Examples 12 14, except that here the B side contain no polyether polyol and no catalyst. Instead, the B side contained 20 grams of ArmolTM 201B 125 and 80 commat grams of Terate 203 as the polyol blend, and 38.5 grams of Freon llA.
