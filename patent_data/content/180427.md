# A PROCESS FOR SEPARATING ETHYLBENZENE FROM XYLENES BY SELECTIVE ADSORPTION ON A RUBIDIUM SUBSTITUTED X ZEOLITE

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for selectively adsorbing ethylbenzene from a stream containing one or more isomeric xylenes. The ethylbenzene is adsorbed on an Rb substituted Type X zeolite. Certain desorbents, of which n alkylbenzenes are preferred, give the zeolite good ethylbenzene selectivity over the xylenes.
