# VACUUM COATING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A vacuum metallizer comprises a vacuum chamber split into a number of sub chambers by partitions 5 to 8 . A ma terial transport mechanism 2, 3, 4 is disposed in one sub chamber and metallizing sources 11, 12, 13 the others. Sub chambers are individually pumped to provide close control of sub chamber pressures. Sources are activated and when the length of material is drawn past them the metal of the sources is deposited thereon. Each partition comprises two sealed parts 20 and 21 one of which moves with the web transport mechanism whilst the other remains in the vacuum chamber when the chamber is opened. This enables a close gap to be maintained between partitions and mechanism which in turn restricts gas leakage between adjacent sub chambers.
