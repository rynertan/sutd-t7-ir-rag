# Two stage clutch damper assembly.

## Abstract
A two stage clutch damper assembly 10 for use in an automotive vehicle adapted to dissipate the irregular impulses of a vehicle diesel engine when the transmission is in neutral, the clutch is endgaged and the engine is at idle rpm. The assembly includes a clutch plate 17 , a spring retainer plate 28 secured to the clutch plate 17 , and a main hup in operative engagement with the transmission input shaft and having an integral hub flange 14 with spring notches 15 openend to allow an addi tional rotational travel of the clutch and spring retainer plates relative to the hub. An intermediate hup 36 has a radial flange 37 between the clutch plate 17 and main hub 11 and an inner hub 42 is concentric in said intermediate hub 36 and spring biased away from said main hub. The inner hub 42 is splined onto the transmission input shaft, and the inner and intermediate hubs have interengaging helical teeth 41, 45 so that rotary motion of said intermediate hub results in acial movement of said inner hub.
