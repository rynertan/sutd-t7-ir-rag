# SYSTEM FOR TRANSFERRING A FINE PATTERN ONTO A TARGET

## Abstract
An X ray system for transferring a fine pattern onto a tar get has a mask 12 , on the surface 6 of which is formed an X ray absorbing layer 17 in a predetermined pattern and which is made of a single crystal 2 of high regularity. Parallel mon ochromic X rays 4 become incident on the lattice plane h, k, l of the single crystal 2 at an angle O. Diffraction X rays 8 emerging from the lattice plane h, k, l are projected onto the surface of a wafer 16 in the normal direction. An X ray resist layer 18 is formed on the surface of the wafer 16 . Since inci dent X rays 4 and diffraction X rays 8 are absorbed by the X ray absorbing layer 17 on the mask 12 , the pattern de fined by the layer 17 is projected on the X ray resist layer 18 .
