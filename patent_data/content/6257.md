## Description
Skeleton construction for a prefabricated building. The invention relates to a skeleton construction for a prefabricated building comprising corner posts, intermediate posts and trusses formed by various profiles fastened to one another by means of different joints. The invention has for its object to provide a skeleton construction which can be simply and readily mounted during the erection of the building, because the various prefabricated parts fit to one another and can be fastened in and on one another. The various prefabricated parts have dimensions such that they can be transported in conventional containers so that costs are saved. The construction is, moreover, such that the cross sections of the channel section profiles employed have the same dimensions so that roof and or wall plates of the same thickness can be used. According to the invention the corner post is formed by a box shaped profile to which over part of its length is fastened an L profile on the outer sides, whilst a further L profile is arranged on the inwardly extending rim so that the L profiles are shorter than the box shaped profile, to the lower side of which are fastened U profiles. The intermediate post is formed by a box shaped profile to which over part of its length U profiles are fastened on two opposite sides, said U profiles being shorter than the box shaped profile, whereas the lower side of the box shaped profile has fastened to itU profiles. The trusses are composed by two halves to be slipped one into the other and to be secured to one another and are equipped with means for placing and fixing on the corner and or intermediate posts. The invention will be described more fully with reference to the drawing. Figure 1 is a front view of a corner post and Figure 2 is a sectional view taken on the line Il Il in figure 1, Figure 3 is a front view of an intermediate post and Figure 4 is a sectional view taken on the lineIV IV in figure 3. Figure 5 illustrates on a reduced scale the structure of the truss. Figure 6 finally shows part of the truss construction with the fastening area of the truss on an intermediate post. Figure 7 shows in elevation a building according to the invention. The corner post Figures 1 and 2 comprises the box shaped profile 1, to which over part of its length, on the outer sides, an L profile 2 is fastened, whereas the Gprofile 3 is mounted on the inwardly extending rim. The two L profiles 2 and 3 are shorter than the box shaped profile 1. The free portion of the box shaped profile 1 has fastened to it on the lower side theU profiles 4. These profiles are provided, if necessary, at their free ends with strips 5, which can be slipped into and fixed in joining U profiles of other posts so that a stable connection and a correct alignment are ensured. The holes 6 serve to pass bolts to be inserted into the foundation. The intermediate post figures 3 and 4 is formed by the box shaped profile 7, to which over part of its length on two opposite sides are fastened the twoU profiles 8. In the same manner as with the corner post the U profiles 9 are secured to the lower side of the box profile 7. Also these U profiles are provided with strips 5 and holes 6. The truss figure 5 comprises two halves each having a top beam consisting of two U profiles 10 and 11, whose webs located in a vertical plane are secured to one another and a box shaped profile 12 fastened to the top beam. In the box shaped profile 12 a smaller box shaped profile 13 is fastened in one half of the truss to serve as an insertable connecting piece for the box shaped profile 12 of the other half of the truss. To the bottom side of the top beam are secured two strips 14 having holes 15 for fixing rods not shown in the drawing interconnecting several trusses. For each truss half four rods are provided and hence eight rods for the whole truss. To the lower side of the box shaped profile 12 is fastened at right angles thereto a U profile 19, in which a box shaped profile 20 is fastened at the level of the truss. The two truss halves and the assembled truss are mounted on the corner posts and or intermediae posts as shown in figure 6. The two halves are fastened to one another by sliding the said box shaped profile 13 of one half into the box shaped profile 12 of the other half, whilst at the same time a small portion of the box shaped profile 17 is slipped onto a curved round iron 18. The box shaped profile 17 as well as the curved round iron 18 are rigidly secured to the top rods. Then the trusses are placed on the posts. The box shaped profile 20 then fits into the box shaped profile 7 and the U profile 19 fits along two sides around the box shaped profile 7. The truss is then drawn tight to the post by means of the tapped rod 22, which engages on one side the hole 23 of the box shaped profile 12 and on the other side the T profile 21 rigidly secured to the box 7. The space between the two truss halves on the top side may be filled out with a profiled lath 24. Together with the eight tie rods between the trusses an immovable construction is obtained between the trusses and the various vertical girders. The trusses have the conventional water drain gutters 25e All U profiles of both the trusses and the posts have the same cross sections and serve to receive and fasten roof and or wall plates of the same thickness.The connection between the various parts may usually be established by welding.
