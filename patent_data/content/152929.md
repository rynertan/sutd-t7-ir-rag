## Description
This invention relates to current sources formed on an integrated circuit IC chip. More particularly, this invention relates to MOS cascoded bipolar current sources such as may be used as part of a high performance amplifier circuit. The invention is described herein for use in amplifiers employed in a cascaded two stage D A converter. US A 3,997,892 Susset shows a two stage cascaded D A converter wherein the first stage includes a resistor string DAC to produce a first segment voltage corresponding to a set of higher order input bits. That voltage is directed through buffer amplifiers to the second stage converter which interpolates the selected first stage segment voltage in accordance with the lower order bits. From US A 4,237,472 a monolithic integrated circuit is known which can be formed by a non epitaxial process in a n well provided in a p substrate. This known circuit comprises a pup transistor connected in series with a PMOS transistor. Both transistors are interconnected without the need of bridging metallisation by sharing a common p region, which constitutes the emitter of the bipolar transistor and the drain of the PMOS transistor. This circuit is designed as a EA ROM. For such a converter as disclosed in US A 3 997 892 to perform successfully at high resolutions, such as 16 bits, the inter stage buffer amplifiers must meet extremely stringent specifications. It has been found that such specifications cannot be achieved using known techniques. An IC amplifier design is provided utilizing uniquely configured MOS bipolar current sources which significantly enhance the performance of the amplifier. These current source structures are formed using an N well non epitaxial IC process, and advantageously make possible inter connections within the current source without the need for bridging metallization. These current sources comprise the features such as disclosed in claims 1 and 6. Although the current sources are disclosed in an amplifier implementation, such current sources can find application in other types of integrated circuits. Still other objects, aspects and advantages of the invention will in part be pointed out in, and in part apparent from, the following description of a preferred embodiment considered together with the accompanying drawings. Referring first to Figure 1, which is a simplified diagram of a 16 bit D A converter, it will be seen that the device includes two cascaded stages generally indicated at 20 and 22. Each stage comprises a 256 R resistor string 24, 26. Logic circuitry 28, 30 of known type of design is used to develop the switch control signals for the respective stages. Buffer amplifier A₁, A₂ are employed to direct the first stage segment output voltage to the second stage where it is applied to the ends of the resistor string 26. The first stage resistor string 24 receives a voltage shown as V Details of the switch selector system and the associated resistor string for this converter are described in the application of the same Applicants, filed with the EPO the same day under the title TWO STAGE HIGH RESOLUTION DIGITAL TO ANALOG CONVERTER . Figure 2 shows a simplified circuit diagram of an amplifier suitable for use as amplifiers A₁, A₂ and A₃. These amplifiers were specified to settle to 16 bits in 3µs and simultaneously be high precision dc op amps. The amplifier includes a single differential gain stage Q₁₁₃, Q₁₁₄, which uses an immitance inverter Q₁₀₈ ₁₁₂ as a load, followed by an MOS bipolar unity gain impedance buffer. This dominant pole compensated amplifier achieves an A To preserve open loop gain, all current sources shown as an arrow in a circle are MOS cascoded bipolar structures. Details of one such current source are shown at M₁₁₃ and Q₁₃₃. The resulting impedance enhancement afforded by the reverse voltage transfer ratio of the FET permits an Early voltage of 10⁶ volts to be achieved at the drain of M₁₁₃. Similarly, Q₁₀₄ and M₁₀₅ provide the same advantage for sources originating from the positive supply, side stepping the inherently low impedance of the split vertical lateral PNP S which are unavoidable device problems in a non epitaxial process. I The configuration of such P type and N type MOS cascoded bipolar current sources are shown in Figures 3A and 3B, representing the cross section and plan views respectively of the devices. Figure 3C shows the electrical circuit representation of each device, approximately aligned with the corresponding elements of Figures 3A and 3B. Referring now to the left hand portion of Figures 3A and 3B, the non epitaxial P type substrate is doped to form the usual N well 100. At the left end of the N well is a first P type diffusion 102 of generally rectilinear outline which serves as the drain of a PMOS device. The source of this device is formed by a second P type diffusion 104 having its principal portion arranged as a square shaped ring. The PMOS gate 106 is positioned between the source and drain. Within the square ring of diffusion 104 is another P type diffusion 108 which serves as the emitter of a lateral PNP transistor. The N type material of the N well serves as the base of this transistor, and connection is made to the base by an N diffusion 109 of generally U shape and extending partially around the square ring P type diffusion 104. The collector of the LPNP is diffusion 104, shared as above by the PMOS source. Thus it will be seen that this diffusion serves as both the collector of the LPNP and the source of the PMOS device. Since both of these functions are performed by the same diffusion, the PMOS source and the PNP collector are effectively connected together electrically, without any need for bridging metallization. That is, no additional layer of metal has to be added to the substrate to make this connection, which is illustrated in the circuit diagram of Figure 3C at 110. No electrode is provided for the P type diffusion 104, since no external connection is needed to be made to the source collector of the MOS bipolar current source. Electrodes are provided for the PMOS drain and for the base and emitter of the LPNP transistor. A distinct characteristic of the PMOS bipolar current source is that the entire circuit is integrated into a single N well, which affords important benefits in carrying out the process. Turning now to the right hand portion of Figures 3A and 3B, there is shown another N well diffusion 112 within which is a P type diffusion 114 containing another N type diffusion 116. These three elements function respectively as the collector, base and emitter of an NPN transistor. Base and emitter electrodes 118, 120 are formed above the substrate to make the necessary connections. The N well 112 is effectively extended laterally by means of an N diffusion 122 which overlaps the initial N type diffusion. The N diffusion reaches to a region alongside a gate electrode 124, and a further N diffusion 126 is made on the other side of the gate. This latter diffusion serves as the drain of an NMOS device. The source of this device is formed by the N type material with the N well 112. Thus, it will be seen that the N well 112 which in this embodiment includes extension 122 serves as both the source of an NMOS device and the collector of an NPN transistor. Accordingly, these two elements are effectively electrically connected, as indicated at 128 in Figure 3C, without the need for a metallization layer. The inclusion of diffusion 122, a low resistivity source drain diffusion comparable to that routinely used in N MOS and CMOS fabrication, is to enhance the performance of the composite structure through the reduction of the ohmic resistance diagrammatically represented as path 128 in Figure 3C. The operation of this invention is otherwise unaffected by the omission of 122.
