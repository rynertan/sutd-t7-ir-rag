# Process for the preparation of C substituted pyridines and or hydrogenated C substituted pyridines.

## Abstract
An improved process for the preparation of pyridines and or hydrogenated pyridines that have been substituted with a hydrocarbon group at one or mor carbon atoms. Î³ cyanoketone, in a gaseous phase and in the presence of hydrogen, is passed in a reaction zone over a first catalyst containing a catalytically active metal or compound of a metal selected from the group copper, silver, gold, iron, nickel, cobalt, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iri dium and platinum to form a reaction mixture. A hydrogen containing gas is separated from the reaction mixture, pas sed over a second catalyst containing a catalytically active metal or compound of a metal selected from the group iron, nickel and cobalt at a temperature of between 300 and 800 C, and the hydrogen containing gas so treated is recycled to the reaction zone.
