## Description
This invention relates to a silica base material for dentifrice formulation, particularly to one for transparent dentifrice formulation, which gives an outstanding, stable transparency yet with a desired abrasiveness. Of late years transparent dentrifice formulations of various types have been developed and put on the market, giving a favorable impression with their freshness and cleanliness associated with the transparency. The status quo, however, is either a silica base material with substantially no abrasiveness, which essentially disqualifis it, is used to give transparency to the dentrifice formulation, or it is hard to produce a commercially stable transparent dentrifice formulation due to the fluctuation and the poor time stability in refrative index of silica, base material which, when made into a paste with a transparent dentifrice vehicle, should approximate in refractive index to the other to give transparency to the formulation. Meanwhile, several methods have been proposed to produce silica base materials having appropriate abrasiveness for transparent formulation. For example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 74 11159 describes a method wherein a commercial super fine amorphous silica devoid of abrasiveness and therefore unsuitable for dentifrice base material is wetted with water or a dilute aqueous solution of inorganic alkali metal salt, fired at 500 1000 C, and then ground. It is true that this method provides abrasiveness needed by a dentifrice base material. But the abrasiveness thus provided is often so much in excess as to damage enamel of teeth and the material itself does not give good transparency and consistent stability. Finally, it would be hard to industrialize the method economically. Another method is described in Japanese Patent Kokai Nos. 76 12869 and 76 136841 to provide abrasiveness to silica. The material obtained by this method, however, does not give good paste stability when combined with transparent dentifrice vehicle. The invention described in Japanese Patent Publication No. 73 14935 discloses a transparent dentifrice formulation containing silica specified as follows The silica prepared by the method disclosed in the invention gives a BET surface area of 150 m² g, and a CTAB surface area of 82 m² g. When this silica is mixed with humectant and left to stand, the turbidity of the mixture, or paste, grows markedly from day to day and the paste stability is gradually worsened. In addition, one of the present inventors disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 74 8640 and 77 15078 a method to control the refractive index of silica by allowing fluoride ion to intervene in the proposed process. The product of this invention as a base material for transparent dentifrice formulation was still not without problem in transparency and was not so good in time stability as expected. Thus the silicas publicly known heretofore have defects either in abrasiveness, time stability or transparency which are the essential characteristics of the base material for transparent dentifrice formulation, and therefore none of them are satisfactory for such formulation. Years of intensive study on these essential character istics of silica base material has now revealed to the present inventors that combinations of a tooth paste vehicle with the silica base material of the present invention, as described in delail below, can bring forth a transparent dentifrice formulation with proper abrasiveness, water like transparency and good long term stability under storage. Transparency as referred to in this invention is defined and measured as follows two solutions of different refractive indices like glycerine and water are mixed in various proportions to give dispersion media of different refractive indices a fixed amount of silica base material is then mixed with a fixed amount of each medium into a dispersion, which, in needed, is deaerated and subjected to measurement of refractive index and turbidity and with these as parameters a curve is plotted to determine the minimum turbidity point which represents the transparency here. The present inventors studied very much in detail on the factors influencing the transparency and, finding out that the porosity of silica base material is greatly involved, came to accomplish the invention. Namely, the invention relates to a silica base material for dentifrice formulation characterized by having a specific surface area by the BET method of 5 60 m² g anhydride, and also, one by the CTAB method of 5 60 m² g anhydride having the difference in specific surface area of less than 40 m² g anhydride between the BET method and the CTAB method and having a refractive index of 1.42 1.45. Now before proceeding to the further details of the present invention, explanations will be given here on the terminology covering specific surface area by the BET method, specific surface area by the CTAB method, refractive index and loss by abrasion, or abrasiveness. Now the method for making the silica base material for dentifrice formulation of this invention will be described in detail. The alkali metal silicate used in the invention includes sodium, potassium and lithium silicate, but more general of these is sodium silicate because it is less costly. Silicates having a molar ratio, SiO₂ X₂O, wherein X denotes alkali metal, of 2 4 can be used. The acidifying agent used in this invention is hydrochloric or sulfuric acid. The preferable SiO₂ concentration of the alkali metal silicate solution at the stage of acidification with such acid is 5 15 by weight and the preferable acid concentration is also 5 15 by weight and in proper combination with other reaction parameters the acid and silicate concentrations within such ranges can bring forth the desired properties of silica base material. The electrolytes preferred in this invention are alkali metal salts of mineral acid such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate, to name only sodium and potassium salts as typical examples. The electrolyte is used in the range of 10 60 by weight of SiO₂, as required, considering the abrasiveness of silica base material. In the present invention the alkali metal silicate solution is first made to react with hydrochloric or sulfuric acid under the presence of such electrolyte. The preferred manner of performing the reaction is to mix the electrolyte previously with the alkali metal silicate solution, in view of giving the abrasiveness to silica base material. That, however, will not disapprove the manner in which the electrolyte, in consideration of its quantity, reaction temperature, reaction time, etc., is added to hydrochloric or sulfuric acid in advance. In said preferred manner also it is well to charge the reactor with alkali metal silicate solution and electrolyte solution simultaneously or separately, or it is as well to mix these two solutions prior to their introduction into the reactor. It is preferable to conduct the reaction under good agitation in a temperature range of 60 100 C. The essence of the production method of silica base material according to the invention disclosed herein lies in the fact that the reaction between alkali metal silicate solution and hydrochloric or sulfuric acid under the presence of electrolyte is conducted in two stages i.e. a silica crystallization stage during which the temperature is maintained between 60 and 100 C for a time from 40 minutes to 4 hours and the pH of the reaction mixture is brought to 10.0, and the neutralization stage for which the pH is finally brought down to 8.0 6.5 the ratio of the rate of addition of chloride or sulfate ions in the neutralization stage to the rate of addition of chloride or sulfate ions in the silica crystallization stage is at least 5 3 and the neutralization is carried out within 30 minutes, and the ageing is performed for at least 10 minutes. The silica crystalization stage herein means the stage of reaction where more than 95 of silica content as SiO₂ in the alkali metal silicate solution is crystallized out. It is preferable to conduct this part of reaction to take 40 minutes to 4 hours. Meanwhile, the neutralization stage is the stage of reaction ranging from the point where most of the silica has neutralized out at the reaction pH of 10.0 to the point where the pH has been brought down to 8.0 6.5 by adding hydrochloric or sulfuric acid. Taking to long in the neutralization or taking to short in the ageing somehow makes it difficult to obtain silica base material of excellent and long lasting transparency and pretty good abrasiveness. The present inventors, therefore, studied further for a method devoid of such a defact, which would give a variety of silica base material of low to high abrasiveness for transparent formulation, and found out that it is necessary to perform the neutralization stage within 30 minutes and that the ratio of the rate of addition of chloride or sulfate ions in the neutralization stage to the rate of addition of chloride or sulfate ions in the silica crystallization stage should be at least 5 3, and also the ageing should be performed for at least 10 minutes. Namely, shortening the neutralization stage and at least 10 minutes ageing led to remarkable improvement in the characteristics of silica base material and its productivity. When the pH reaction mixture in the neutralization stage is made 8.0 6.5, the refractive index of the resulting silica base material can be brought within a narrow range of 1.42 1.45. When the reaction pH lowers 6.5, silica base material good for transparent formulation can not be obtained because of the scattering of refractive indices. When the reaction pH exceeds 8.0, turbidity on refractive index is carried too high, and also it makes pH of the silica base too high, so it s not good for the silica base material for dentifric. The rest of operation is to filter, wash, dewater, dry and grind the silica base material in the usual manner. The silica base material thus obtained has a specific surface area by the BET method of 5 60 m² g anhydride and also one by the CTAB method of 5 60 m² g anhydride having the difference in specific surface area of less than 40 m² g anhydride between the BET method and the CTAB method and having a refractive index of 1.42 1.45. The product shows good transparency and a long term stability. The abrassiveness of the product can be changed freely within the range of 2 90 mg. Thus the product is a useful base material particularly for transparent dentifrice formulations. Described above is one of the processes for producing silica base material for transparent dentifrice formulations, and it is also possible to obtain by different process silica base material having a specific surface area by the BET method of 5 60 m² g anhydride and also one by the CTAB method of 5 60 m² g anhydride, having the difference in specific surface area of less than 40 m² g anhydride between the BET method and the CTAB method. It is clear that the thus obtained base material has excellent transparency and stability over time. Furthermore, in the production of the silica herein, it is, of course, possible to use and add, for the purpose of adjusting abrasiveness or as refractive index controlling agent, to alkali metal silicate solution, hydorchloric acid or sulfuric acid and other or while being in reaction stage, aluminum sulfate, aluminum chloride, calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, basic salts of these compounds, sodium fluoride, potassium fluoride, ammonium fluoride and others. Now, the features of silica basic material for dentifrice formulations of this invention will be better clarified through the examples shown below Into a 20 ℓ reactor equipped with a baffle plate and an agitator with 150 mm D turbine blades was introduced 10 kg of an aqueous solution of sodium silicate Na₂O 3.2 SiO₂ containing 110 g kg of SiO₂ and then, under the reaction temperature kept at 75 C, 11 sulfuric acid at the flow rate of 57 g min for 63 minutes to bring the pH of reaction mixture to 10.0. Then the addition of 11 sulfuric acid was continued at the flow rate of 96 g min until 12 minutes later when the pH reaced 7.8. The acid was stopped and the reaction mixture was allowed to stand for ageing for 20 minutes. After repeated filtration and washing, the obtained solid was dried in a hot air oven at 110 C and finely ground. The silica fine powder thus obtained has a specific surface area by the BET method of 171 m² g and another by the CTAB method of 146 m² g and the difference in specific surface area of both method was 25 m² g. The silica find powder thus obtained had good transparency as a base material for transparent dentifrice formulation, but a poor abrasiveness, and when it was used for toothpaste, increased the viscosity. Thus, silica of this kind was found not to be usable for toothpaste in its preparation. Into a reactor used in reference 1 was introduced 10 kg of an aqueous solution of sodium silicate Na₂O 3.1 SiO₂ containing 90 g kg of SiO₂ and 11 g kg of NaCl and then, under the reaction temperature kept at 65 C, 9 sulfuric acid at the flow rate of 176 g min for 21 minutes to bring the pH of the reaction mixture to 10.0. Then the addition of 9 sulfuric acid was continued at the flow rate of 32 g min until 46 minutes later when the pH reached 5.8, and stopped addition then allowed to stand for ageing for 30 minutes. After repeated filteration and washing, the wet cake was dried in a hot air oven at 110 C and finely ground. The silica fine powder thus obtained had a specific surface area by the BET method of 215 m² g and another by the CTAB method of 98 m² g and the difference in specific surface area of both method was 117 m² g. This silica has poor abrasiveness, comparatively high turbidity and poor long lasting transparency, thus not being suitable for transparent dentifrice formulation as base material. Into a reactor used in reference 1 was introduced 10 kg of an aqueous solution of sodium silicate Na₂O 2.7 SiO₂ containing 100 g kg of Si0₂ and 25 g kg of NaCl and then, under the reaction temperature kept at 80 C, 10 sulfuric acid at the flow rate of 46 g min for 95 minutes to bring the pH of reaction mixture to 10.0. Then the addition of 10 sulfuric acid was continued at the flow rate of 92 g min until 17 minutes later when the pH reached 6.2. The acid was stopped and the reaction mixture was filtrated immediately. After repeated filtration and washing, the obtained solid was dried in a hot air oven at 110 C and finely ground. The silicate fine powder thus obtained had a specific surface area by the BET method of 83 m² g and another by the CTAB method of 18 m² g and the difference in specific surface are of both method was 65 m² g. This silica had comparatively high abrasiveness as base material for dentifrice formulations, but the product made from this silica showed high turbidity and poor long lasting tranceparency, thug, this silica is not of such quality as can be used for transparent toothpaste as base material. Into a reactor used in reference 1 was introduced 10 kg of sodium silicate solution Na₂O 3.l SiO₂ containing 95 g kg of SiO₂ and 35 g kg of NaCl and then under the reaction temperature kept at 95 C, 10 sulfuric acid at the flow rate of 56 g min for 89 minutes to bring the pH of the reaction mixture to 5.2. The acid was stopped and the reaction mixture was allowed to stand for ageing for 15 minutes. After repeated filtration and washing, part of the wet cake was dried in a hot air oven at 110 C and finely ground. The silica fine powder thus obtained had a specific surface area by the BET method of 208 m² g and another by the CTAB method of 21 m² g and the difference in specific surface area of both method was 187 m² g. This silica base material prove to be a product of sufficient abrasiveness to meet requirments of base material for toothpaste but of high turbidity and giving poor transparency over time, and is not suited for silica base material for transparent dentifrice formulation. Into a reactor used in reference 1 was introduced 10 kg of an aqueosu solution of sodium silicate Na₂O 3.1 SiO₂ containing 100 g kg of SiO₂ and 17.5 g kg NaCl and then, under the reaction temperature kept at 85 C, 10 sulfuric acid at the flow rate of 36 g min for 100 minutes to bring the pH of reaction miture to 10.0. The the addition of 10 sulfuric acid was continued at the flow rate of 26 g min until 52 minutes later when the pH reached 6.3. The acid was stopped and the reaction mixture was allowed to stand for ageing for 30 minutes. After repeated filtration and washing, the obtained soild was dried in a hot air oven at 110 C and finerly ground. The silica fine powder thus obtained had a specific surface area by the BET method of 59 m² g and another by the CTAB method of 16 m² g and the difference in specific surface area of the method was 43 m² g. This silica base material prove to be a product of sufficient abrasiveness to meet requirements of base material for toothpaste but giving poor transparency over time, and is not suited for silica base material for transparent dentrifrice formulation. Inventors obtained commercially abailable silica base material for toothpaste made in USA for evaluation of the physical property. As a result, it was found that it had a specific surface area by the BET method of 87 m² g and another by the CTAB method, of 42 m² g and the difference in specific surface area of both method was 45 m² g. It proved to be a product of sufficient abrasiveness and low turbidity on just after mixed with a transparent paste vehicle, but presenting poor transparency over time. Into a reactor used in reference 1 was introduced 30 kg of sodium silica solution Na₂O 3.1 SiO₂ containing 110 g kg of SiO₂ and 15 g kg of NaCl and then under the reaction temperature kept at 90 C, 10 sulfuric acid at the flow rate of 54 g min for 76 minutes to bring the pH of the reaction mixture to 10.0. Then the addition of 10 sulfuric acid was continued at the flow rate of 97 g min until 14 minutes later when the pH reached 7.2. The acid was stopped and the reaction mixture was allowed to stand for ageing for 20 minutes. After repeated filteration and washing, the wet cake was dried in a hot air oven at 110 C and finely ground. The silica fine powder thus obtained had a specific surface area by the BET method of 36 m² g and another by the CTAB method of 22 m² g and the difference in specific surface area of both method was 14 m² g. It proved to be a product of moderate abrasiveness, good transparency and long lasting transparency. Table 1 shows the physical properties of the products produced in these reference. As described in above references Nos. 1 to 6 and example of the present invention, three parameters of the BET specific surface area, the CTAB specific surface area and the difference in specific surface area of both method are important factors for determing such physical properties of silica base material for transparent dentifrice formulations as transparency, abrasiveness and long lasting transparency of the toothpaste product, silica failing to satisfy said three parameters is not desirable as silica base material for toothpaste, particularly for transparent dentrifrice formulation. When the silica base material of the present invention is used in a transparent toothpaste formulation, the base material is fixed and kneaded with a transparent paste vehicle. In order to give proper fluidity to such toothpaste formulation, the paste vehicle is chosen from humectants and binders. Among humectants there are, for example, glycerine, sorbitol, polyethylene glycol, dextrin, proplylene glycol, etc., and for binders there are carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium alginate, etc. Toothpaste formulations containing such humectants or binders and other ingredients such as cleaning agent, perfume, sweetening, enzyme and various medicinal adjuvants are widely known to those experienced in the art. As is understood from the explanation given, the silica base material of the present inventions is most effectively used in the production of transparent toothpaste of desired abrasiveness. The invention will be further explained by way of examples, which in no way shall be construed to limit the scope of the invention. In the following examples, percentages shall denote percentages by weight unless otherwise specified.

Into a 5 m³ reactor equipped with a baffle plate and an agitator with 850 mm D turbin blades was introduce 3070 kg of sodium silicate solution Na₂O 3.2 SiO2 containing 95 g kg of SiO₂ and 10 g kg of NaCl and then, under the reaction temperature kept at 95 C, 10 sulfuric acid at the flow rate of 11.2 kg min for 93 minutes to bring the pH of the reaction mixture to 10.0. Then the addition of 10 sulfuric acid was continued at 23.3 kg min until 16 minutes later when the pH reached 6.7. The acid was stop and the reaction mixture was allowed to stand for ageing for 30 minutes. After repeated filtration and washing, the obtained solid was dried in a hot air oven at 110⁰C and finely gournd. The silica fine powder thus obtained had a specific surface area by the BET method of 52 m² g and another by CTAB method of 19 m² g the difference in specific surfase area of both method was 33 m² g it had an abrasiveness value of 10.3 mg, a refractive index of 1.441 and a lowest turbidity of 0.08 and it proved to be a product of moderate abrasiveness and long lasting transparency. Into a 20 ℓ reactor equipped with a baffle plate and an agitator with 150 mm D turbine blades was introduced 10 kg of an aqueous solution of sodium silicate Na₂O 2.8 SiO₂ containing 110 g kg of SiO₂ and 55 g kg of Na₂SO₄ and then, under the reaction temperature kept at 75 C, 11 sulfuric acid at the flow rate of 65 g min for 64 minutes to bring the pH of the reaction mixture to 10.0. Then the addition of 11 sulfuric acid was continued at 123 g min until 11 minutes later when the pH reached 7.6. The acid was stopped and the reaction mixture was allowed to stand forageing for 15 minutes. After repated filtration and washing, the obtained solid was dried in a hot air oven at 110 C and finely ground.

Into a reactor used in example 3 was introduced 10 kg of an aqueous solution of potassium silicate K₂O 3.0 SiO₂ containing 100 g kg of SiO₂ and 13 g kg of KCl and then, under the reaction temprature kept at 80 C, 8 hydrochloric acid at the flow rate of 78 g min for 46 minutes to bring the of the reaction mixture to 10.0. Then the addition of 8 hydrochloric acid was continued at 133 g min until 9 minutes later than the pH reached 6.8. The acid was stopped and the reaction mixture was allowed to stand for ageing for 20 minutes. After repated filtration and washing, the obtained solid was dried in a hot air oven at 110 C and finely ground.

The examples given above clearly show that the product of the present invention has excellent characteristics as a base material for transparent dentifrice formulations. It has been proved that when there is a need to add good transparency and long lasting transparency to silica base materials having comparatively high abrasiveness, the use of humectant selected out of solbitol and polyethylene glycol together with water gives excellent results for such requirement. Table 2 below shows refractive index and long lasting transparency measured on the glycerin solution, solbitol solution and polyethylene glycol solution, each containing 30 of silica base materials obtained in Example 1. As shown in Table 2, glycerin solution humectant has a drawback in causing slight loss of transparency during long storage period while solbitol solution and polyethylene glycol solution bring out no change in transparency during long storage period. This proves that transparent toothpaste composed of silica base materials of this invention, a humectant selectected out of solbital and polyethlene glycol and water for excells in transparency of the toothpaste product and its long lasting transparency. The refractive index and turbidity of commercial transparent toothpastes are as shown in Table 3. Comparison of Table 3 and other data cited hereinbefore reveals clearly that the transparent toothpaste formulations now commercially available are substantially less transparent than the corresponding formulations using the silica base material of the present invention.
