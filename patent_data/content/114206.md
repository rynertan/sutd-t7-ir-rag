# Process for the electrolysis of sea water to produce hypochlorite and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
In a process for the electrolysis of sea water to produce hypochlorite in at least one electrolysis cell equipped with anodes and cathodes forming interelectrodic spaces, the improvement comprising admixing sea water before elec trolysis with sufficient hypochlorite solution to substantially oxidize bromine, iodine and sulfur ion impurities to their elemental forms and an apparatus for said process. Prefer ably, the hypochlorite solution is recycled from an electroly sis cell and the ratio of recycle liquid to sea water is adjusted to increase the temperature of the sea water mixture to at least 9.6 C.
