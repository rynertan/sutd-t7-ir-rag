# miniature electrical terminal for low energy electronic circuits.

## Abstract
An electrical connector formed to mate with a cylindrical pin type connector and establish separate lines of electrical contact tangentially along a portion of the length of the pin connector by the use of resiliently hinged V shaped contacts. An insulative housing for the connector provides a protruding locking element and a removable locking wedge to secure the connection in place.
