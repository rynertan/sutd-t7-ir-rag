# Covulcanizable compositions of fluoroelastomers based on vinylidene fluoride and tetrafluoroethylene propylene copolymers.

## Abstract
A fluoroelastomer A based on vinylidene fluoride 40 83 by moles , perfluoropropene 15 35 and tetraf luoroethylene 0 30 and a diamino compound B , are mixed with a copolymer C containing tetrafluoroethylene 40 60 by moles and propylene 60 40 . The thus obtained mixture is covulcanizable with sys tems based on organic peroxides. In particular mixtures are employed, containing A 42 70 by weight, B 1 4 , C 51 22 , peroxide, 0,4 5 , triallylisocianurate 2 4 .
