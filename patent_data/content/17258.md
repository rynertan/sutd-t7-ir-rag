# Improved radial tyres provided with a stiffening structure in the sidewalls.

## Abstract
Subject matter of the invention is a tyre for vehicle wheels, comprising a radial carcass, a tread and an annular reinforcing structure inserted between the said carcass and said tread and being substantially circumferentially inexten sible and at least as wide as the tread. For providing favorable transversal and circumferential rigidity in the zones of the sidewalls of the type particularly of a high speed tyre there are arranged in each sidewall a mixed textile metallic reinforcement 14 , comprised by two skirts 15, 16 of textile cords having different widths, the cords of said skirts being inclined with respect to the radial direction of the carcass cords, and by a strip 17 of metallic cord also inclined with respect to said radial direction and having a lesser width to that of said greater width skirt 15 and inserted in between said skirts 15, 16 .
