# Polypeptides.

## Abstract
Polypeptides having the formula R₁ Lys Lys X R₂ I wherein R₁ is hydrogen or p Glu X is Glu or Asp and R₂ is NH₂, Val NH₂ or Val OH, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts have the capability of inducing the maturation of T cell populations and thus are useful in a number of therapeutic areas. They are prepared by classical or solid phase synthetic methods via appropriate protected peptide intermediates having the formula
