# Filter arrangement.

## Abstract
A first resistor R₁ and a first capacitor C₁ constitute a filter arrangement having a time constant which is not very accurate due to the inaccuracy of the resistor and the capacitor values in intergrated circuits. The time constant is adjusted using a circuit comprising a reference resistor R₂ and a switched capacitor C₃ . The value of the reference resistor R₂ and the equivalent resistance of the switched capacitor C₃ are compared by means of an integrator C₂, 2 from whose output 9 a control voltage is taken via a hold circuit C₄, C₅ , which control voltage is equal to the voltage at that point on the reference resistor where the resistance value is equal to that of the switched capacitor C₃ . By means of comparator 21 to 30 and switches S₁₁ to S₂₀ a percentage of the total resistance of the first resistor R₁ is short circuited, which percentage is equal to the difference between the resistance of the reference resistor R₂ and the equivalent resistance of the switched capacitor C₃ , express ed as a percentage of this equivalent resistance.
