# CROSSED FIELD VELOCITY FILTER AND ION BEAM PROCESSING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A cross field velocity filter for separating ions having a predetermined velocity comprises a pair of electrodes 11, 12 for producing a radial electric field and a pair of pole pieces 13, 14 for producing a magnetic field which crosses the electric field so that the crossed field velocity filter has the same focusing properties for an ion beam in both the direction of the electric field and the direction of the magnetic field.
