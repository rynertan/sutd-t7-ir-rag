# High efficiency catalyst for polymerizing olefins prepared from organotitanium and magnesium components.

## Abstract
Compositions exhibiting high catalytic activity in the polymerization of Î± olefins are prepared by reacting a mixture of a tetrahydrocarbyloxy titanium compound such as tetraisopropyl titanate and a hydrocarbyloxy titanium oxide such as di isopropoxy titanium oxide, an organomag nesium component such as a hydrocarbon soluble complex of dialkyl magnesium and an organoaluminum compound such as triethyl aluminum and a halide source such as ethyl aluminum dichloride. Polymerization processes employing this catalyst composition do not require conventional catalyst removal steps in order to provide polymers having suitable color and other physical characteristics and these catalysts provide higher efficiencies than those catalysts employing either of the titanium compounds alone.

## Description
HIGH EFFICIENCY CATALYST FOR POLYMERIZING OLEFINS This invention relates to a new catalyst composition useful for polymerization of a olefins and to a polymerization process employing such a catalyst composition. It is well known that olefins such as ethylene, propylene and l butene in the presence of certain metallic catalysts can be polymerized to form substantially unbranched polymers of relatively high molecular weight. Among the methods for producing such linear olefin polymers, some of the most widely utilized are those described by Professor Karl Ziegler in U.S.Patents 3,113,115 and 3,257,332. In these methods, the catalyst employed is obtained by admixing a compound of a transition metal of Groups IVB, V, VIB and VIII ofMendeleev s Period Table of Elements with an organometallic compound. Generally, the halides, oxyhalides and alkoxides or esters of titanium, vanadium and zirconium are the most widely used transition metal compounds. Common examples of the organometallic compounds include the hydrides, alkyls and haloalkyls of aluminum, alkylaluminum halides, Grignard reagents, alkali metal aluminum hydrides, alkali metal borohydrides, alkali metal hydrides, alkaline earth metal hydrides and the like. Usually, polymerization is carried out in a reaction medium comprising an inert organic liquid, e.g., an aliphatic hydrocarbon and the aforementioned catalyst.One or more olefins may be brought into contact with the reaction medium in any suitable manner. A molecular weight regulator, which is normally hydrogen, is usually present in the reaction vessel in order to suppress the formation of undesirably high molecular weight polymers. Most of the aforementioned known catalyst systems are more efficient in preparing polyolefins in slurry i.e., wherein the polymer is not dissolved in the carrier than in solution i.e., wherein the temperature is high enough to solubilize the polymer in the carrier . The lower efficiencies of such catalysts in solution polymerization is generally believed to be caused by deactivation of such catalysts by the higher temperatures employed in solution processes. In addition, processes involving the copolymerization of ethylene with higher a olefins exhibit catalyst efficiencies significantly lower than ethylene homopolymerization processes Recently, catalysts having higher efficiencies have been disclosed, e.g., U.S. Patent 3,392,159 U.S. Patent 3,737,393 West German Patent Application 2,231,982 and British Patents 1,305,610 and 1,358,437.While the increased efficiencies achieved by using these recent catalysts are significant, even higher efficiencies are desirable, particularly in copolymerization processes. These high efficiency catalysts generally produce polymers of relatively narrow molec ular weight distribution. But for certain uses, a wider molecular weight range is desirable. The present invention, in one aspect, is an improvement in the catalytic reaction product of A a tetravalent titanium compound, B an organomagnesium.component, C a halide source, and, if either components B or C does not contain sufficient quantities of aluminum, then D an aluminum compound is also present the improvement being the use of, as the titanium compound, a mixture containing a tetrahydrocarbyloxy titanium compound and a dihydrocarbyloxy titanium oxide. The molar ratio of the tetraalkoxy titanium compound to dialkoxy titanium oxide is 0.1 1 to 10 1, preferably 0.2 1 to 5 1 and most preferably 0.33 1 to 3 1. The magnesium component is 1 a complex of an organomagnesium compound and an organometallic compound which solubilizes the organomagnesium compound in a hydrocarbon solvent or 2 an organomagnesium compound. The proportions of the foregoing components of said catalytic reaction products are such that the atomic ratios of the elements are Mg Ti is 1 1 to 200 1 preferably 2 1 to 100 1 most preferably 5 1 to 75 1 Al Ti is 0.1 1 to 1000 1 preferably 0.5 1 to 200 1 most preferably 1 1 to 75 1 excess X Al is 0.0005 1 to 5 1 preferably 0.001 1 to 2 1 most preferably 0.01 1 to 1.4 1. The X is excess halide above that which would be theoretically required to convert the magnesium compound to the dihalide. In a second aspect, the invention is a process for polymerizing at least one a olefin or diolefin under conditions characteristic of Ziegler polymerization wherein the aforementioned reaction product is employed as the catalyst. The present invention is most advantageously practiced in a polymerization process wherein an a olefin or diolefin is polymerized, generally in the presence of hydrogen as a molecular weight control agent, in a polymerization zone containing an inert diluent and the catalytic reaction product. Especially advantageous is the copolymerization of ethylene and higher a olefins or diolefins using the catalytic reaction product of this invention. The process is most beneficially carried out under inert atmosphere and relatively low temperature and pressure, although very high pressures are optionally employed. Olefins which are suitably homopolymerized or copolymerized in the practice of this invention are generally the aliphatic a monoolefins or a diolefins having from 2 to 18 carbon atoms. Illustratively, such a olefins can include ethylene, propylene, butene 1, pentene l, 3 methylbutene l, 4 methylpentene l, hexene l, octene l, dodecene 1, octadecene l, and 1,7 octadiene. It is understood that a olefins may be copolymerized with other a olefins and or with small amounts, i.e. up to about 25 weight percent based on the copolymer, of other ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as styrene, a methylstyrene and similar ethylenically unsaturated monomers which do not destroy conventional Ziegler catalysts. Most benefits are realized in the polymerization of aliphatic a monoolefins, particularly ethylene and mixtures of ethylene and up to 50, especially from about 0.1 to 40, weight percent of propylene, butene 1, hexene l, octene l, 4 methyl pentene l, 1,7 octadiene or similar a olefin or diolefin based on total monomer. Advantageously, the titanium tetraalkoxide is represented by the empirical formula Ti OR 4 wherein each R is independently an alkyl or an aryl group having from 1 to 12, preferably from 2 to 10, carbon atoms. Exemplary of such compounds include tetra n butoxytitanium, tetra isopropoxy titanium, and tetraphenoxytitanium. Advantageously, the dialkoxy titanium oxide is represented by the empirical formula RO 2TiO wherein each R is independently an alkyl or an aryl group having 1 to 12, preferably 2 to 10, carbon atoms.Exemplary of such compounds are diethyoxy titanium oxide, diisopropoxy titanium oxide, di n butoxy titanium oxide, diphenoxy titanium oxide, mixtures thereof and the like. The dihydrocarbyloxy titanium oxides employed in the present invention can be prepared according to the procedure described in THE ORGANIC CHEMISTRY OF TITANIUM, Raoul Feld P. O. Cowe, Butterworth Co. Publishers Ltd., 1965, page 141. The preferred organomagnesium component is a hydrocarbon soluble complex illustrated by the empirical formula MgR 2xMRI y wherein each R is independently hydrocarbyl or hydrocarbyloxy M is aluminum, zinc or mixtures thereof x is zero to 10, especially zero to 2.5, and y denotes the number of hydrocarbyl groups which corresponds to the valence of M. As used herein, hydrocarbyl and hydrocarbyloxy are monovalent hydrocarbon radicals. Preferably, hydrocarbyl is alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkenyl and similar hydrocarbon radicals having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, with alkyl having 1 to 10 carbon atoms being especially preferred. Likewise, preferably, hydrocarbyloxy is alkoxy, cycloalkyloxy, aryloxy, aralkyloxy, alkenyloxy and similar oxyhydrocarbon radicals having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, with alkyloxy having 1 to 10 carbon atoms being preferred.Hydrocarbyl is preferred over hydrocarbyloxy. This complex is prepared by reacting particulate magnesium, such as magnesium turnings, or magnesium particles with about a stoichiometric amount of hydrocarbyl or hydrocarbyloxy halide, illustrated as R X.The resulting MgR 2, if it is hydrocarbon insoluble, can be solubilized by adding the organometallic compound such as AlR 3 or mixtures thereof with ZnR z. The amount of organometallic compounds which is added to the MgR112 to form the organomagnesium complex should be enough to solubilize a significant amount of MgR 2, e.g., at least 5 weight percent of MgR 2. It is preferred to solubilize at least 50 weight percent of the MgR 2 and especially preferred to solubilize all the MgR 2. To obtain maximum catalyst efficiency at polymerization temperatures above 1800C, it is desirable to minimize the amount of aluminum in the complex as well as in the total catalyst. Accordingly, for catalysts having Al Ti atomic ratios less than 120 1 it is desirable to have a Mg Al atomic ratio more than 0.3 1, preferably 0.5 1 to 10 1. In suitable complexes, organometallic compounds other than All 3 , ZnR 2 or mixtures thereof which also solubilize the organomagnesium compound in hydrocarbon are employed in beneficial amounts, usually an amount sufficient to produce an atomic ratio of 0.01 1 to 10 1 of metal of the organometallic compounds to magnesium.Examples of such other organometallic compounds include boron trialkyls such as boron triethyl, alkyl silanes such as dimethyl silane and tetraethyl silane, alkyl tin and alkyl phosphorous compounds. Alternately to such solubilized magnesium complexes, other organomagnesium compounds although insoluble in hydrocarbons, are often suitably employed.These compounds can be rendered soluble in hydrocarbon by addition of ether, amine, etc., although such solubilizing agents often reduce the activity of the catalyst. Recently, such compounds have been made hydrocarbon soluble without such additives, e.g., as taught in U.S. 3,646,231. Such hydrocarbon soluble organomagnesium compounds are the most desirable if an organomagnesium compound is to be used as the organomagnesium component. Preferably the organomagnesium compound is a hydrocarbon soluble dihydrocarbylmagnesium such as the magnesium dialkyls and the magnesium diaryls. Exemplary suitable magnesium dialkyls include particularly n butyl sec butyl magnesium, diisopropyl magnesium, di n hexyl magnesium, isopropyl n butyl magnesium, ethyl n hexyl magnesium, ethyl n butyl magnesium, di n octyl magnesium and others wherein alkyl is from l to 20 carbon atoms. Exemplary suitable magnesium diaryls include diphenylmagnesium, dibenzylmagnesium, and ditolylmagnesium, being especially preferred.Suitable organomagnesium compounds include alkyl and aryl magnesium alkoxides and aryloxides and aryl and alkyl magnesium halides with the halogen free organomagnesium compounds being more desirable. Suitable organoaluminum compounds include those represented by the empirical formula AlR3aXa wherein R is hydrocarbyl, hydrocarbyloxy or as hereinbefore defined such as alkyl X is a halogen and a is a number from zero to 3. Most preferred are the aluminum alkyls such as, for example, triethyl aluminum, triisobutyl aluminum, diethylaluminum chloride, diethylaluminum bromide, mixtures thereof and the like. It is understood that the organic moieties of the aforementioned organomagnesium, e.g., R , and the organic moieties of the halide source, e.g., R and R , are suitably any other organic radical provided that they do not contain functional groups that poison conventional Ziegler catalysts. Preferably such organic moieties do not contain active hydrogen, i.e those sufficiently active to react with the Zerewitinoff reagent. The halide source is suitably a nonmetallic halide corresponding to the empirical formula R X wherein R is hydrogen or an active monovalent organic radical and X is halogen. Alternatively, the halide source is a metallic halide corresponding to the empirical formula MRy aXa wherein M is a metal of Group IIIA orIVA of Mendeleev s Periodic Table of the Elements, R is a monovalent organic radical, usually hydrocarbyl or hydrocarbyloxy, X is halogen, y is a number corresponding to valence of M and a is a number from 1 to y. The preferred halide sources are the active non metallic halides of the formula set forth above including hydrogen halides and active organic halides such as t alkyl halides, allyl halides, benzyl halides and other active hydrocarbyl halides wherein hydrocarbyl is as defined hereinbefore. By an active organic halide it is meant a hydrodarbyl halide that contains a halide atom at least as active, i.e., as easily lost to another compound, as the halogen of sec butyl chloride, and preferably as active as t butyl chloride. In addition to the organic monohalides, it is understood that organic dihalides, trihalides and other polyhalides that are active as defined hereinbefore are also suitably employed. Examples of preferred active non metallic halides include hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, t butyl chloride, t amyl bromide, allyl chloride, benzyl chloride, crotyl chloride, methylvinyl carbinyl chloride, a phenylethyl bromide, diphenyl methyl chloride, t butyl chloride, allyl chloride and benzyl chloride. Suitable metallic halides as set forth by formula hereinbefore are organometallic halides and metal halides wherein the metal is in Group IIIA or IVA, of Mendeleev s Periodic Table of Elements. Preferred metallic halides are aluminum halides of the empirical formula AlR3 aXa wherein each R is independently hydrocarbyl as hereinbefore defined such as alkyl X is a halogen and a is a number from 1 to 3.Most preferred are alkylaluminum halides such as ethylaluminum sesquichloride, diethylaluminum chloride, ethylaluminum dichloride and diethylaluminum bromide, with ethylaluminum dichloride being especially preferred.Alternatively, a metal halide such as aluminum trichloride or a combination of aluminum trichloride with an alkyl aluminum halide or a trialkyl aluminum compound may be suitably employed. In order to maximize catalyst efficiency, the catalyst is prepared by mixing the components of the catalyst in an inert liquid diluent in one of the following especially preferred orders 1 A, D if necessary , C and B 2 B, C, D if necessary and A 3 B, C, A and D if necessary and if C is not a tin chloride 4 C, D if necessary , A and B with methods 2 and 3 being especially preferred. The foregoing catalyst components are combined in proportions sufficient to provide molar and atomic ratios as previously mentioned. The foregoing catalytic reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of an inert diluent.The concentrations of catalyst components are preferably such that when the essential components of the catalytic reaction product are combined, the resultant slurry is 0.005 to 1.0 molar moles liter with respect to magnesium. By way of an example of suitable inert organic diluents can be mentioned liquefied ethane, propane, isobutane, n butane, n hexane, the various isomeric hexanes, isooctane, paraffinic mixtures of alkanes having from 8 to 12 carbon atoms, cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane, dimethylcyclohexane, dodecane, 2,2,4 trimethylpentane industrial solvents composed of saturated or aromatic hydrocarbons such as kerosene, naphthas, etc., especially when freed of any olefin compounds and other impurities, and especially those having boiling points in the range from 500C to 2000C.Also included as suitable inert diluents are benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, cumene, decalin and the like. Mixing of the catalyst components to provide the desired catalytic reaction product is advantageously carried out under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen, argon or other inert gas at temperatures in the range from 100 C to 2000C, preferably OOC to 1000C. The period of mixing is not considered to be critical as it is found that a sufficient catalyst composition most often occurs within 1 minute or less. In the preparation of the catalytic reaction product, it is not necessary to separate hydrocarbon soluble components from hydrocarbon insoluble components of the reaction product. If desired, the catalytic reaction product of this invention may also contain a dialkyl zinc component wherein the alkyl groups are the same or different and contain from 1 to 10 carbon atoms. Suitable such dialkyl zinc compounds include, for example, diethyl zinc, diisopropyl zinc, di n propyl zinc, di n butyl zinc, di sec butyl zinc, mixtures thereof and the like.Such zinc compounds tend to provide polymers of broadened molecular weight distribution, as taught in U.S. Patent 4,238,355. In the polymerization process employing the catalytic reaction product, polymerization is effected by adding a catalytic amount of the above catalyst composition to a polymerization zone containing a olefin monomer, or vice versa. The polymerization zone is maintained at temperatures in the range from 0 to 3000C, preferably at solution polymerization temperatures, e.g., from 130 C to 2500C for a residence time of a few seconds to several days, preferably 15 seconds to 2 hours. It is generally desirable to carry out the polymerization in the absence of moisture and oxygen and a catalytic amount of the catalytic reaction product is generally within the range from about 0.001 to 0.1 millimoles titanium per liter of diluent.It is understood, however, that the most advantageous catalyst concentration will depend upon polymerization conditions such as temperature, pressure, solvent and presence of catalyst poisons and that the foregoing range is given to obtain maximum catalyst yields in weight of polymer per unit weight of titanium. Generally in the polymerization process, a carrier which may be an inert organic diluent or solvent or excess monomer, is generally employed. In order to realize the full benefit of the high efficiency catalyst of the present invention, care must be taken to avoid oversaturation of the solvent with polymer. If such saturation occurs before the catalyst becomes depleted, the full efficiency of the catalyst is not realized.For best results, it is preferred that the amount of polymer in the carrier not exceed about 50 weight percent based on the total weight of the reaction mixture. The polymerization pressures preferably employed are relatively low, e.g., from 0.45 to 7.1 MPa 50 to 1000 psig , especially from 0.8 to 5.0 MPa 100 to 600 psig . However, polymerization within the scope of the present invention can occur at pressure from atmospheric up to pressures determined by the capabilities of the polymerization equipment. During polymerization it is desirable to stir the polymerization recipe to obtain better temperature control and to maintain uniform polymerization mixtures throughout the polymerization zone. In order to optimize catalyst yields in the polymerization of ethylene, it is preferable to maintain an ethylene concentration in the solvent in the range from about 1 to 10 weight percent, most advantageously 1.2 to 2 weight percent. To achieve this, when an excess of ethylene is fed into the system, a portion of the ethylene can be vented. Hydrogen can be employed in the practice of this invention to alter the molecular weight of the resultant polymer. For the purpose of this invention, it is beneficial to employ hydrogen in concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 1 mole per mole of monomer. The larger amounts of hydrogen within this range are found to product generally lower molecular weight polymers.It is understood that hydrogen can be added with a monomer stream to the polymerization vessel or separately added to the vessel before, during or after addition of the monomer to the polymerization vessel, but during or before the addition of the catalyst. The monomer or mixture of monomers is contacted with the catlytic reaction product in any conventional manner, preferably by bringing the catalytic reaction product and monomer together with intimate agitation provided by suitable stirring or other means.Agitation can be continued during polymerization, or in some instances, the polymerization can be allowed to reamin unstirred while the polymerization takes place.In the case of more rapid reactions with more active catalysts, means can be provided for refluxing monomer and solvent, if any of the latter is present and thus removing the heat of reaction. In any event adequate means should be provided for dissipating the exothermic heat of polymerization. If desired1 the monomer can be brought in the vapor phase into contact with the catalytic reaction product, in the presence or absence of liquid material. The polymerization can be effected in the batch manner, or in a continuous manner, such as, for example, by passing the reaction mixture through an elongated reaction tube which is contacted externally with suitable cooling medium to maintain the desired reaction temperature, or by passing the reaction mixture through an equilibrium overflow reactor or a series of the same. The polymer is readily recovered from the polymerization mixture by driving off unreacted monomer and solvent if any is employed. No further removal of impurities is required. Thus, a significant advantage of the present invention is the elimination of the catalyst residue removal steps. In some instances, however, it may be desirable to add a small amount of a catalyst deactivating reagent of the types conventionally employed for deactivating Ziegler catalysts. The resultant polymer is found to contain insignificant amounts of catalyst residue and to possess a relatively broad molecular weight distribution. The following examples are given to illustrate the invention. All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated. The following atomic weight values were employed in the examples to calculate the ratios of the components.
