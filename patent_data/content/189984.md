# Improvements in ribbon cassettes.

## Abstract
A ribbon cassette, such as in inked ribbon for a printing machine, has a supply spool and a take up spool. An unwinding force is applied to the ribbon and the take up spool is driven from the supply spool through a slip coupling. The configuration of the driving connection be tween the spools is such as to lead to a theoretical speed of the take up spool which is always greater than is actually needed to match the speed of unwinding from the supply spool. Slip however occurs to match the speeds and to maintain tension in the ribbon.
