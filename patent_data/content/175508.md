# Vibrational gyroscope.

## Abstract
A vibrational gyroscope is provided with a vibrating mem ber in the form of a flexible annular shell 5 extending from a flat flexible plate 6 . In use, the flat plate 6 is vibrated and ex cites radial vibrations in the lip of the annular shell 5 . When the gyroscope is rotated about the shell axis 16 , the nodes of the radial vibrations shift around the circumference of the lip, due to the action of Coriolis forces. The radial nodes 19 of the vibrations in the plate 6 shift similarly and their movement is detected by sensing means S1, S2 on the plate 6 , giving an indication of the rotation rate.
