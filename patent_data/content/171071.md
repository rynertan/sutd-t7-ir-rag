# Radio communication system comprising a portable unit carrying out a battery saving operation related to a scanning operation of a fixed unit.

## Abstract
In a radio communication system comprising a fixed unit 10 carrying out a first scanning operation at a channel scanning period in a waiting state and a portable unit 11 intermittently put in a waiting state thereof into active and inactive for active and inactive durations, respectively, the portable unit comprises a power source circuit 30 for ren dering a sum of the active and the inactive durations equal to the channel scanning period. In each active state, a fre quency synthesizer 39 carries out a second scanning operation to successively scan the radio channels one by one in cooperation with the controller 38 to detect whether or not each of the radio channels is idle. The second scan ning operation may proceeds either in the same order as the first scanning operation or in a reverse order relative to the first scanning operation. Alternatively, the second scanning operation may be carried out in a phase different from the first scanning operation. In this event, either one of the fixed and the portable units that is delayed in phase may skip from an actual channel to an additional one.
