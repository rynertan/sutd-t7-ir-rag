# Method of identifying objects provided with a code field containing a dot code, a device for identifying such a dot code, and a product provided with such a dot code.

## Abstract
For the purpose of identifying it, an object is provided with a code field containing a dot code. The code field possesses a certain degreee of multiplicity of rotational symmetry for exam ple, 2, 3, 4, 6 . The code field contains information dots from which the orientation can be detected. Redundancy is added which includes the orientation information, so that a certain degree of error correction is possible. By way of example, a suitable code is given for rotationally symmetric objects on which there is not enough space for a bar code.
