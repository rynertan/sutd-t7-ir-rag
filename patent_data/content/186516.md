# MICROCAPSULE CONTAINING WATER BASE COATING FORMULATION AND COPYING AND OR RECORDING MATERIAL MADE THEREFROM

## Abstract
The water base coating formulation comprises as essen tial components a microcapsules which have a synthetic resin as a wall forming material and b a reaction product obtained by polymerizing at least one water soluble vinyl monomer B in the presence of a high polymer latex A having a glass transition point of 60 C or lower. The latex A and vinyl monomer B are used at a solid weight ratio of 3 97 90 10. The coating formulation can provide a microcapsule coated layer having significantly improved pressure resistance and frictional stability without need for a stilt, and can be applied successfully at a high speed. The coating formulation can form the basis of carbonless copying and or recording paper for instance of self contained character incorporating both a dye precursor and color developer.
