# Process for manufacturing a platform for scaffoldings and platform obtained by using said process.

## Abstract
Process for the manufacturing of a platform for scaffoldings and similar of the type comprising at least four mutually parallel tubular longitudinal members the axes of which are situated according to the sides of a rectangular parallelepiped, said longitudinal members being mutually assembled through tubular cross members the axes of which are distributed on three adjacent sides of the said parallelepiped, characterized in that it comprises substantially drilling holes through the longitudinal members 1 4 at regular locations at right angles with their axes drilling holes through two of said longitudinal members at right angles with their axes and that of the said holes and then mutually assembling the longitudinal members 1 4 with the cross members 5 by passing and shifting the ends of the latter through the corresponding holes.

## Claims
Claims. 1. Process for the manufacture of a platform for scaffoldings and similar of the type comprising at least four mutually parallel tubular longitudinal members the axes of which are situated according to the sides of a rectangular parallelepiped, said longitudinal members being mutually assembled through tubular cross members the axes of which are distributed on three adjacent sides of the said parallelepiped, characterized in that it comprises substantially drilling holes through the longitudinal members 1 4 at regular locations at right angles with their axes drilling holes through two of said longitudinal members at right angles with their axes and that of the said holes and then mutually assembling the longitudinal members 1 4 with the cross members 5 by passing and shifting the ends of the latter through the corresponding holes. 2. A process according to claim 1, characterized in that a wooden floor 7 or similar is addditionally clamped between the two doubly drilled longitudinal members. 3. A process according to claim 1, characterized in that a thin plate 8 , respectively 9 , in interlaced between the cross members assembling a doubly drilled longitudinal member with a singly drilled longitudinal member. 4. Platform for scaffoldings and similar, obtained by using the process according to one or several of the preceding claims.

## Description
Process for manufacturing a platform for scaffoldings and platform obtained by using said process The present invention relates to a process for manufacturing a platform for scaffoldings and the like, as well as a plat form obtained by using said process.There is known a platform, e.g. as described in the belgian patent No 750.545, which comprises substantially four mutually parallel tubular longitudinal members the axes of which are disposed according to the sides of a rectangular parallelepiped, said longitudinal members being interconnected through tubular cross members the axes of which are distributed on three adjacent sides of the said parallelepiped.The above assembly and the subsequent application of a carrying surface and side walls are made by welding, which is time consuming and expensive. The purpose of this invention is to provide a more economical manufacture.For this purpose, there is suggested a process for manufacturing platforms of the intended type, said process comprising substantially drilling holes through the longitudinal members at regular locations at right angles with their axes drilling through two of said longitudinal members at right angles with their axes and with that of the first mentioned holes then mutually assembling the longitudinal members with the cross members by passing and shifting the ends of the latter through the corresponding holes.It should be noted that, as a principle, the process according to the invention calls upon a technique which is used for the manufacture of light metal ladders.The enclosed drawing shows diagrammatically a perspective view of an embodiment of the invention.This drawing shows the four longitudinal members 1 4 which are mutually assembled through cross members 5 and 6.The longitudinal members 1 and 2 are doubly drilled so that they may be mutually assembled through the cross members 5 while being also each assembled with a longitudinal member 3 and 4 respectively through cross members 6. The ends of the cross members are narrowed so that the base of said narrowing bears against the side walls of the longitudinal members. The free ends of the narrowings are shifted against the opposite side of the cross members.On the cross members 5, is disposed a wooden floor 7 which is clamped between the longitudinal members 1 and 2.Between each of the cross members 6 is in a manner interlaced a thin plate 8 and 9 respectively, thereby forming the side walls of the platform.In addition, suspending stirrups, small wheels and similar are conventionally adapted.It is apparent that this invention is not at all limited to the above described example, it being possible to provide numerous modifications within the scope of the following claims.
