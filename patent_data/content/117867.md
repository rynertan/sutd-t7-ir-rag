# SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE.

## Abstract
In an integrated circuit which has a power transistor and a control transistor formed separated by an isolation region on a semiconductor substrate, a buried p type layer 3 is formed directly on the semiconductor substrate 1 , and a buried n type layer 4 is formed on the layer 3 . A high resistance n type layer 13 is then formed by an epitaxial growth method over the whole surface, a p type isolation diffused region 6 connected to the p type layer 3 and an n type isolation diffused layer 7 connected to the n type layer 4 are formed, a control transistor or a resistor is formed in the isolated n type epitaxial layer, and a power transistor is formed in the epitaxial layer which is not isolated.
