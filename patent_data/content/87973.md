# Tracking servo system for optical disc information reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
A tracking servo system for an optical disc information reproducing apparatus is disclosed. The system is provided with a light source 12 for generating a light beam 10 to scan a target track 24 on an optical disc 16 wherein the information is stored as a series of pits or recesses arranged in the form of tracks 24 , a pair of photodetecting means D1,D3 and D2,D4 intersecting each other and disposed in a direction oblique to an image of the target track 24 for use in converting an image 28 of the pit or recess into respective electric signals T1, T2 , means 74 for comparing the phases of the electric signals T1, T2 for producing a tracking error signal T15 which varies in accordance with a phase difference between the electric signals T1, T2 and means 52,50,20 for deflecting the light beam 10 in directions perpendicular to the target track 24 in response to the tracking error signal T15 so that the light beam 10 scans the target track 24 accurately.
