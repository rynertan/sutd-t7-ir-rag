# Automatic firearm.

## Abstract
A machinegun pistol switchable between semi and full automatic modes by an operator holding the gun in a natural two hand grip. The gun includes a bolt 20 and a firing pin device 22 that each slide longitudinally, a trigger assembly with a primary sear 28 that is depressed by the trigger for semiautomatic operation, and an auto control member 34 that can be depressed into the frame 16 to switch to full automatic operation. When the control member 34 is depressed, it connects a secondary sear 36 with the primary sear. The bolt carries a cam 40 that can depress the secondary sear 36 when the bolt moves forward, to thereby repeatedly depress the primary sear 28 when the two sears are connected during automatic operation. The control member 34 lies on the right side of the gun, forward of the trigger 14 , so that when the left hand is used to also hold the gun, the fingers of the left hand can feel and depress the control member. In another embodiment operation of the control member 34 moves the secondary sear 36 into and out of the path of the bolt cam 40 .
