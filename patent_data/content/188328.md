# Polyamide resin and its production.

## Abstract
A polyamide resin has a relative viscosity of 2.5 to 6 and 40 to 100 of its end groups are substituted by C₆ ₂₂ hydrocarbon groups. The resin may be made by polyconden sation in the presence of a monoamine and or a monocar boxylic acid providing such groups or the resin may be made by polycondensation followed by postcondensation with a monoamine and or a monocarboxylic acid providing such groups.
