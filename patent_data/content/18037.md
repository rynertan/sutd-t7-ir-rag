# Process and apparatus for preparing aluminium alkoxides.

## Abstract
Aluminum alkoxides are prepared by the reaction of impure aluminum and monohydric alcohols in a process wherein impure metallic aluminum particles in 2, 4 and 8 are continuously fed at a metered rate into a stoichiome tric excess of alcohol in 10 . The novel apparatus disclos ed permits the continuous introduction of the aluminum particles into the reactor and removal of non reactive im purities through columns of ambient temperature alcohol which avoids contact of atmospheric oxygen with the re action products.
