# Bridge circuit system.

## Abstract
A sensing circuit system including circuitry for sensing impedance variations of a variable impedance element 12 . As disclosed, a bridge circuit system 11 includes a bridge circuit to which the variable impedance element 12 is couplable. The bridge circuit system 11 further includes circuitry for detecting open circuit or short circuit fault conditions 16,17,18 of the variable impedance element. The variable impedance element 12 is coupled to the bridge circuit by a connector, having two connector components 13,14 , which is also operable to couple the fault detection circuitry to the bridge circuit only when the two components 13,14 of the connector are connected together.
