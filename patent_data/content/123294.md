## Description
SECRETION OF EXOGENOUS POLYPEPTIDES FROM YEAST BACRGROUND The present invention relates generally to recombinant methods and materials for securing the microbial expression of exogenous genes coding for useful polypeptide products and for securing the recovery of such products from microbial cells. More particularly, the present invention relates to the formation of exogenous polypeptides in yeast cells and to the secretion of desired polypeptide products so formed. Numerous substantial advances have recently been made in the use of recombinant DNA methodologies to secure the large scale microbial production of eukaryotic e.g., mammalian gene products in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells grown in culture. In essence, these advances have generally involved the introduction into bacterial, yeast, and higher eukaryote host cell cultures of DNA sequences coding for polypeptides which wholly or partially duplicate the sequences of amino acids present in biologically active polypeptides ordinarily produced only in minute quantities by, e.g., specialized mammalian tissue cells. The hoped for result of such introductions is the stable genetic transformation of the host cells so that the polypeptides coded for by the exogenous genes will be produced in quantity by the protein manufacturing apparatus of the cells. It has long been the goal of workers in this field to devise methods and materials permitting not only the expression and stable accumulation of exogenous polypeptides of interest in host cells but also the secretory transport of intact polypeptide products from host cell cytoplasmic spaces into microbial periplasmic spaces or, preferably, outside the cell into the surrounding medium. With particular regard to the use of E.coli SECRETION OF EXOGENOUS POLYPEPTIDES FROM YEAST BACKGROUND The present invention relates generally to recombinant methods and materials for securing the microbial expression of exogenous genes coding for useful polypeptide products and for securing the recovery of such products from microbial cells. More particularly, the present invention relates to the formation of exogenous polypeptides in yeast cells and to the secretion of desired polypeptide products so formed.

In essence, these advances have generally involved the introduction into bacterial, yeast, and higher eukaryote host cell cultures of DNA sequences coding for polypeptides which wholly or partially duplicate the sequences of amino acids present in biologically active polypeptides ordinarily produced only in minute quantities by, e.g., specialized mammalian tissue cells.The hoped for result of such introductions is the stable genetic transformation of the host cells so that the polypeptides coded for by the exogenous genes will be produced in quantity by the protein manufacturing apparatus of the cells. It has long been the goal of workers in this field to devise methods and materials permitting not only the expression and stable accumulation of exogenous polypeptides of interest in host cells but also the secretory transport of intact polypeptide products from host cell cytoplasmic spaces into microbial periplasmic spaces or, preferably, outside the cell into the surrounding medium. With particular regard to the use of E.coli bacterial cells as microbial hosts, it is known to attempt to secure expression of desired exogenous polypeptides as portions of so called fused polypeptides including, e.g., endogenous enzymatic substances such as B lactamase. Such enzymes normally migrate or are intracellularly processed toward E.coli periplasmic spaces and the fusion polypeptides including enzyme sequences are more or less readily isolated therefrom.See, Talmadge, et al., PNAS USA , 77, 3369 3373 1980 .Extracellular chemical or enzymatic cleavage is employed to yield the desired exogenous polypeptides in purified form. See, e.g., U.S. Letters Patent No. 4,366,246 toRiggs. At present, no analogous methods have been found to be readily applicable to microbial synthetic procedures involving lower eukaryotic host cells such as yeast cells e.g., Saccharomyces cerevisiae . A considerable body of knowledge has developed concerning the manner in which mammalian gene products, especially small regulatory polypeptides, are produced.See, generally, Herbert, et al., Cell, 30, 1 2 1982 .As one example, biosynthetic studies have revealed that certain regulatory peptides are derived from precursor proteins which are ten times the size or more than the biologically active peptides. This fact indicates that significant intracellular processing must take place prior to secretion of discrete active products by the cells. The peptides must be cut out of the precursor and are sometimes chemically modified to active forms prior to secretion. Cleavage from precursors and chemical modifications such as glycosylation, phosphorylation and secretion are generally believed to occur in a welldefined order as newly synthesized proteins pass through the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complexes, and vesicles prior to secretion of biologically active fragments. Studies of polypeptides secreted by yeast cells have indicated that at least somewhat analogous processing of precursor proteins occurs prior to secretion into yeast cell periplasmic spaces or outside the yeast cell wall. A very recent review article on this subject by Schekman, et al., appears at pages 361 393 in TheMolecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces, Metabolism and Gene Expression , Cold Spring Harbor Press 1982 . Briefly put, the review article and the references cited therein indicate that eleven endogenous yeast polypeptide products have been identified which are secreted either into the periplasmic space or into the cellular medium or, on occasion, into both. Among the yeast polypeptides ordinarily secreted into the cellular growth medium are two yeast pheromones, mating factor c and a, pheromone peptidase, and killer toxin . Among the yeast polypeptides ordinarily only transported to periplasmic spaces are invertase, L asparaginase, and both the repressible and constitutive forms of acid phosphatase. Yeast products which have been isolated both from the periplasmic space and yeast cell culture medium include a galactosidase, exo 1 , 3 glucanase, and endo 1,3 ss glucanase. The mechanisms which determine cell wall or extracellular location have not yet been elucidated. The processing prior to secretion of certain of these polypeptides has been studied and it has generally been found that the products are initially expressed in cells in the form of precursor polypeptides having amino terminal regions including signal sequences i.e., sequences of from 20 22 relatively hydrophobic amino acid residues believed to be functional in transport to the endoplasmic reticulum and, in at least some instances, pro or pre sequences which are also ordinarily proteolytically cleaved from the portion of the precursor molecule to be secreted. See, Thill, et al., Mol. Cell.Biol, 3, 570 579 1983 . With the knowledge that yeast cells are capable of intracellular processing of endogenous precursor polypeptides in a manner analogous to the prcessing carried out in mammalian cell systems, studies were recently conducted concerning the potential for secretion of human interferons by yeast. See, Hitzeman, et al.,Science, 219, 620 625 1983 . Briefly put, transformation vectors were constructed which included DNA sequences coding for synthesis of human interferons in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It was reported that expression of interferon genes containing coding sequences for human secretion signals resulted in the secretion into the yeast cell culture medium of polypeptide fragments having interferon immunological activity.While the levels of interferon activity found in the medium were quite low and a significant percentage of the secreted material was incorrectly processed, the results of the studies were said to establish that lower eukaryotes such as yeast can rudimentarily utilize and intracellularly process human signal sequences in the manner of endogenous signal sequences. Of particular interest to the background of the present invention is the developing body of information available concerning the synthesis and secretion of the yeast oligopeptide pheromone, or mating factor, commonly referred to asmating factor a MFa. . Mating in yeast appears to be facilitated by oligopeptide pheromones mating factors of two types, a and a, that cause the arrest of cells of the opposite type in the G1 phase of the cell division cycle. Yeast cells of the a mating type produce MFa in tridecapeptide and dodecapeptide forms which differ on the basis of the presence or absence of a terminal tryptophan residue, while cells of the a type produce MFa in two alternative undecapeptide forms which differ in terms of the identity of the sixth amino acid residue. The structure of the yeast MFa gene has recently been the subject of study by Kurjan, et al., as reported in Cell, 30, 933 943 1982 . Briefly put, segments of yeast genomic DNA were inserted into a high copy number plasmid vector YEpl3 . The vectors were employed to transform mutant data2, leu2 yeast cells which failed to secrete MFG and the culture medium was assayed for the restoration of MFa secretory activity.Those plasmids including a 1.7kb EcoRI fragment together with one or more genomic EcoRI fragments of lesser size were able to restore MFa secretory function. Sequencing of portions of the 1.7kb EcoRI fragment revealed that the cloned segment includes DNA sequences coding for four, spaced apart copies of MFa within a putative precursor polypeptide which extends for a total of 165 amino acids. The amino terminal region of the putative precursor delineated by Kurjan, et al., begins with a hydrophobic sequence of about 22 amino acids that presumably acts as a signal sequence for secretion. A following segment of approximately sixty amino acids con tains three potential glycosylation sites. The carboxyl terminal region of the precursor contains four tandem A copies of mature alpha factor, each preceded by pacer peptides of six or eight amino acids, which are hypothesized to contain proteolytic processing signals. The putative protein coding region within the approximately 830 base pair sequence of the MFa gene published is as follows TABLE I 1 10 20 30 40ATG AGA TTT CCT TCA ATT TTT ACT GCA GTT TTA TTC GCA GCAMet Arg Phe Pro Ser Ile Phe Thr Ala Val Leu Phe Ala Ala 10 50 60 70 80TCC TCC GCA TTA GCT GCT CCA GTC AAC ACT ACA ACA GAA GAT Ser Ser Ala Leu Ala Ala Pro Val Asn Thr Thr Thr Glu Asp 20 90 100 110 120GAA ACG CCA CAA ATT CCC GCT GAA GCT GTC ATC GCT TAC TCAGlu Thr Ala Gln Ile Pro Ala Glu Ala Val Ile Gly Tyr Ser 30 40 130 140 150 160CAT TTA GAA GGG CAT TTC CAT GTT GCT GTT TTG CCA TTT TCCAsp Leu Glu Gly Asp Phe Asp Val Ala Val Leu Pro Phe Ser 50 170 180 190 200 210AAC AGC ACA AAT AAC GGG TTA TTG TTT ATA AAT ACT ACT ATTAsn Ser Thr Asn Asn Gly Leu Leu Phe Ile Asn Thr Thr Ile 60 70 220 230 240 250GCC AGC ATT CCT GCT AAA GAA GAA GGG GTA TCT TTG CAT AAAAla Ser Ile Ala Ala Lys Glu Glu Gly Val Ser Leu Asp Lys 80 260 HindIII270 280 290AGA GAG GCT CAA GCT TGG CAT TGG TTG CAA CTA AAA CCT GGC Arg Glu Ala Glu Ala Trp His Trp Leu Gln Leu Lys Pro Gly 90 300 310 320 HindIll CAA CCA ATG TAC AAG AGA GAA GCC GAA GCT GAA GCT TGG CATGln Pro Met Tyr Lys Arg Glu Ala Glu Ala Glu Ala Trp His 102 111 340 350 360 370TGG CTC CAA CTA AAG CCT GGC CAA CCA ATG TAC AAA AGA GAATrp Leu Gln Leu Lys Pro Gly Gln Pro Met Tyr Lys Arg Glu 123 380 H ndIII 400 410 420 GCC GAC GCT CAA GCT TGG CAT TGG CTG CAA CTA AAG CCT GGC Ala Asp Ala Glu Ala Trp His Trp Leu Gln Leu Lys Pro Gly 132 430 440 450 HindIII 60 CAA CCA ATG TAC AAA AGA GAA GCC GAC GCT GAA GCT TGG CATGln Pro Met Tyr Lys Arg Glu Ala Asp Ala Glu Ala Trp His 144 153 470 480 490TGG TTG CAG TTA AAA CCC GGC CAA CAA ATC TAC TAATrp Leu Gln Leu Lys Pro Gly Gln Pro Met Tyr Stop 165 As previously noted, the MFa gene described in Kurjan, et al., supra, is contained on a 1.7 kilobaseEcoRI yeast genomic fragment.Production of the gene product is inactivated by cleavage with the endonucleaseHindIII and it was noted that HindIII digestion yielded small fragments generally including the following coding regions alpha factor 1 amino acids 90 102 , spacer 2 a factor 2 amino acids 111 123 , spacer 3 a factor 3 amino acids 132 144 , spacer 4 spacer 1 and a factor 4 amino acids 153 165 remain on large fragments. Thus, each MFa coding region in the carboxyl terminal coding region is preceded by a six or eight codon spacer coding region. The first of the spacers coded for has the sequence, NH Lys Arg Glu Ala Glu Ala COO , while the second has the sequence, NE Lys Arg Cla Ala Glu Ala Glu Ala COD. The third and fourth spacers coded for have the same sequence of amino acid residues, i.e., NH Lys Arg Glu Ala Asp Ala Glu Ala COO . Among the proposals of Rurjan, et al. as to the mode of processing of the MFa precursor polypeptide leading up to secretion of MFa was that the precursor was targetted for processing in the endoplasmic reticulum by the putative 22 hydrophobic amino acid signal sequence in the amino terminal region of the precursor amino acids 1 22 . The post targetting fate of the sequence was proteolytic cleavage from the remaining portions of the precursor. The following pro sequence of about 60 amino acids residues 23 83 was proposed to be involved in subsequent targetting of the precursor for further processing and to an eventual fate similar to that of the signal . Finally, it was proposed that the multiple copies of MFa were first separated by a trypsin like enzymatic cleavage between the lysine and arginine residues at the beginning of each spacer that the residual lysine at the carboxyl terminal of all but the fourth MFa copy was digested off by a yeast carboxy peptidase and that diaminopeptidase enzymes would proteolytically delete the remaining spacer residues from the amino terminal of at least one of the four MFa copies. While the work of Kurjan, et al. served to provide much valuable information and many valuable proposals concerning MFa synthesis and secretion in yeast, many questions significant to application of the information to systems other than those specifically involving MFa secretion remained unanswered. Among these was whether the above noted 1.7kb EcoRI yeast genome fragment provides a self contained sequence capable of directing synthesis of MFa i.e., whether it included the entire endogenous promoter regulator for precursor synthesis or, on the other hand, required the presence of other DNA sequences .Other unanswered questions included whether the presence of DNA repeats was required for MFa expression, whether the specific size of the MFa polypeptide is a critical factor in secretory processing events, and whether all potential copies ofMFa in the precursor polypeptide are in fact secreted by yeast cells. A recent publication by Julius, et al., Cell, 32, 839 852 1983 serves to partially confirm the MFa precursor hypothesis of Kurjan, et al. in noting that mutant yeast strains defective in their capacity to produce certain membrane bound, heat stable dipeptidyl diaminopeptidase enzymes coded for by the stel3 gene secrete incompletely processed forms of MFa having additional amino terminal residues duplicating spacer sequences described by Kurjan, et al. Restoration of the mutants capacity to properly process MFa was demonstrated upon transformation of cells with plasmid borne copies of the non mutant form of the stel3 gene. From the above description of the state of the art, it will be apparent that there continues to exist a need in the art for methods and materials for securing microbial expression of exogenous polypeptide products accompanied by some degree of intracellular secretory processing of products facilitating the isola tion of products in purified form.Despite varying degrees of knowledge concerning synthesis and processing of yeast secreted polypeptides and despite some preliminary success in procedures involving yeast secretory processing of exogenous gene products in the form of exogenous precursor polypeptides, the art has been provided with no procedures which take joint advantage of yeast cell capacities both to synthesize exogenous gene products and to properly process endogenous precursor polypeptides in a manner permitting exogenous gene products to be secreted by transformed yeast cells. BRIEF SUMMARY According to one aspect of the invention, there are provided DNA sequences which code for yeast cell synthesis of novel hybrid polypeptides including, in one part, selected exogenous polypeptide amino acid sequence and, in another part, certain endogenous yeast polypeptide amino acid sequences. More particularly, the hybrid polypeptides coded for by DNA sequences of the present invention include, in their carboxyl terminal region, an exogenous polypeptide to be secreted by the yeast cells in which the hybrids are synthesized.Further, a portion of the amino terminal region of the hybrid polypeptides includes sequences of amino acids which duplicate signal or prow or pre sequences of amino terminal regions of endogenous polypeptide precursors of yeast secreted polypeptides which sequences are normally proteolytically cleaved from the endogenous precursors prior to polypeptide secretion into periplasmic spaces or into the yeast cell culture medium . In another of its aspects, hybrid polypeptides coded for by DNA sequences of the invention may also include normally proteolytically cleaved endogenous yeast polypeptide sequences in their carboxyl terminal regions as well. Endogenous yeast DNA sequences duplicated in hybrid polypeptides of the invention may be those extant in polypeptide precursors of various yeast secreted polypeptides such as mating factor a, mating factor a, killer toxin, invertase, repressible acid phosphatase, constitutive acid phosphatase, a galactosidase,L asparaginase, exo 1,3 B glucanase, endo 1,3 B glucanase and peromone peptidase. In presently preferred forms,DNA sequences of the invention code for hybrid polypeptides including endogenous polypeptides which duplicate one or more amino acid sequences found in polypeptide precursors of yeast secreted MFa.The duplicated sequences may thus include part or all of the MFa precursor signal sequence part or all of the MFa pro sequence and or part or all of one or more of the variant MFa spacer sequences as described by Kurjan, et al., supra. Exogenous polypeptide constituents of hybrid polypeptides according to the invention may be of any desired length or amino acid sequence, with the proviso that it may be desirable to avoid sequences of amino acids which normally constitute sites for proteolytic cleavage of precursor polypeptides of yeast secreted polypeptides. In an illustrative and presently preferred embodiment of the invention, an exemplary novel DNA sequence constructed codes for a hybrid polypeptide including, in its carboxyl terminal region, a human 6 endorphin polypeptide. According to another aspect of the invention,DNA transformation vectors are constructed which incorporate the above noted novel DNA sequences. These vectors are employed to stably genetically trnasform yeast cells which are then grown in culture under conditions facilitating expression of desired hybrid polypeptides. The desired hybrids are, in turn, intracellularly processed with the result that desired exogenous polypeptide products are secreted into yeast cell periplasmic spaces and or outside the yeast cell wall into the yeast cell culture medium. In vectors of the present invention, expression of the novel DNA sequences may be regulated by any suitable promoter regulator DNA sequence. Illustrative examples of DNA transformation vectors of the invention include plasmids pYaE and pYc E on deposit under contract with the American Type CultureCollection, Rockville, Maryland, as ATCC Nos. 40068 and 40069, respectively. Both these plasmids include hybrid polypeptide coding regions under control of promoter regulator sequences duplicating those associated with genomic expression of MFa by yeast cells.Plasmid pYaE ATCC No. 40068 may be employed according to the present invention to transform a suitable Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell line e.g., any a, leu2 strain such asGM3C 2 and the cultured growth of cells so transformed results in the accumulation, in the medium of cell growth, of polypeptide products possessing one or more of the biological activities le.g., immunoreactivity of human 3 endorphin. Other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The novel products and processes provided by the present invention are illustrated in the following examples which relate to manipulations involved in securing yeast cell synthesis and secretion of polypeptide substances having one or more of the biological activities of human B endorphin. More specifically,Examples 1 through 7 relate to 1 the isolation of an MFa structural gene as a DNA fragment from a yeast genomic library and the partial sequencing of the cloned fragment 2 the construction of a DNA sequence coding for human 8 endorphin 3 the ligation of the B endor phin coding DNA sequence into the MF structural gene 4 the insertion of the resulting DNA sequence into a transformation vector 5 the transformation of yeast cells with the resulting vector 6 the isolation and characterization of polypeptide products secreted into the culture medium by transformed cells and 7 the construction of an alternative transformation vector. EXAMPLE 1 A Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome library inE.coli was screened with a synthetic oligonucleotide hybridization probe, and a plasmid with complementarity to the probe was cloned. From this cloned plasmid a 2.lkb EcoRI fragment with complementarity to the probe was subcloned in pBR322. The oligonucleotideprobe used duplicates the sequence of bases later designated 474 through 498 of the sense strand DNA sequence set out in Figure 5 of Kurjan, et al., supra. Approximately 500 base pairs of the isolated fragment were initially sequenced by Maxam Gilbert and dideoxy chain termination techniques and found to be essentially identical to the sequence of the protein coding region of an MFa structural gene set out by Kurjan, et al., supra. The 2.lkb fragment was digested with XbaI.The larger, 1.7kb digestion fragment obtained was ligated to a BamHI linker DNA sequence and inserted into an E.coli bacterial plasmid pBRAH, i.e., pBR322 which had been modified to delete the HindIII site cut with BamHI. The resulting plasmid, designated puFc, was amplified. EXAMPLE 2 A DNA sequence coding for human ILeu5 B endorphin polypeptide was synthesized and constructed according to the procedures of co pending U.S. PatentApplication Serial No. 375,493 filed May 6, 1982 byStabinsky. The specific sequence constructed is set out in Table II below. Terminal base pair sequences outside the coding region are provided to facilitate insertion into the MFa structural gene as described, infra.

The resulting Rf M13 DNA, designated M13 ssEnd 9, was purified. EXAMPLE 3 Plasmid paFc was digested with HindIII to delete three of the four MFa coding regions. As may be noted from the sequence of the protein coding region of the MFa structural gene in Table I, after such endonuclease treatment there remained a HindlII sticky end at the terminal portion of the first of the spacer amino acid sequences Ala89 and a HindIII sticky end just before the final MFa sequence Trp153 . M13 ssEnd 9, containing the Leu5 ss endorphin gene, was similarly digested with HindIII and the resulting 107 base pair fragment was purified and ligated into the Hind III cleaved puFc to generate plasmid paE. TheDNA sequence thus generated is seen to code for synthesis of a new hybrid polypeptide. In the new hybrid polypeptide, there is included, in the carboxyl terminal portion, an exogenous polypeptide, i.e., lLeu5 S endorphin. In the new hybrid polypeptide, there are included sequences of amino acid residues duplicative of one or more sequences which are extant in the amino terminal region of an endogenous polypeptide precursor of a selected yeast secreted polypeptide i.e., MFa and which are normally proteolytically cleaved from the yeastsecreted polypeptide portion of the precursor prior to secretion. It may be here noted that in an alternative construction available according to the invention, a tandem repeating ss endorphin gene or other selected gene might be constructed and inserted into the HindIII cleaved paFc. In such a tandem repeating gene construction, the termination codons of the first B endorphin coding sequence would be deleted and the first coding sequence would be separated from the second sequence by, e.g., a DNA sequence coding for part or all of one of the alternative MFa spacer polypeptide forms. It would be preferred that alternative codons be employed in the region joining the spacer to the second ss endor phin sequence so that no HindIII restriction site would remain.Upon insertion as above, the novel DNA sequence would code for a hybrid polypeptide which further included a normally proteolytically cleaved endogenous yeast sequence in its carboxyl terminal region, i.e., between two ss endorphin analog polypeptides. Similarly, multiple repeats of a selected exogenous gene may be incorporated separately by part or all of any of the variant spacers. EXAMPLE 4 Plasmid paE was digested with BamHI and the small fragment obtained was ligated into a high copy number yeast E.coli shuttle vector pGT4l cut with BamHI to form plasmid pYciE ATCC No. 40068 which was amplified in E.coli. EXAMPLE 5 Plasmid pY E was employed to transform a suitable a, Leu2 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae GM3C 2 wherein the Leu2 phenotype allowed selection of trans formats. Transformed cells were grown in culture at 300C in 0.67 Yeast Nitrogen Base without amino acids Difco , 28 glucose, 18 histidine and 1 tryptophan. Additionally, strain GM3C 2 transformed with a plasmid identical to pYaE, with the exception that the S endorphin gene was in the opposite orientation, was cultured under identical conditions as a control. EXAMPLE 6 Cultures from transformed and control cells were collected, centrifuged, and the supernatants tested for the presence of ss endorphin activity by means of a competitive radioimmunoassay for human 8 endorphin New England Nuclear Catalog No. NEK 0031. No activity at all was determined in the control media, while significant 6 endorphin activity, on an order representing 200 micrograms of product per O.D. liter, was found in the media from cultured growth of transformed cells. HPLC analysis of the concentrated active media revealed three major RIA activity peaks. The most prominent peak, representing approximately one third of the total 6 endorphin activity, was isolated and amino acid sequencing revealed an essentially pure preparation of a polypeptide duplicating the sequence of the final 12 amino acid residues of human 6 endorphin. Experimental procedures are under way to determine whether the 12 amino acid product is the result of intracellular proteolytic processing by the transformed cells or is an artifact generated by extracellular proteolytic cleavage occurring during handling of the culture medium. If the latter proves to be the case, protease inhibitors will be added to the medium in future isolative processing. EXAMPLE 7 In order to determine whether secretory processing of yeast synthesized 6 endorphin analog by transformed cells will be facilitated by reduction of the quantities of hybrid polypeptide produced, a single copy centromere plasmid pYcaE ATCC No. 40069 has been constructed with an inserted BamHI fragment from paE. Analysis of cell media of yeast transformed with this vector is presently under way. In further experimental studies, the potential secretory rate limiting effects of available secretory processing enzymes will be determined. In one such procedure, yeast cells transformed with vectors of the invention will also be transformed to incorporate an stel3 gene as described in Julius, et al., supra, so as to provide over production of the heat stable dipeptidyl aminopeptidase believed to be involved in MFa secretory processing. While the foregoing illustrative examples relate to the construction of DNA sequences coding for signal and pro and spacer polypeptide sequences extant in the polypeptide precursor of MFa, it is expected that beneficial results may be secured when only one or two such sequences are coded for or when only a portion of such sequences e.g., only the Lys Arg portion of a spacer are coded for. Similarly, while the yeast strain selected for secretory expression of exogenous polypeptide products was of the a phenotype, it is not necessarily the case that cells of the a phenotype would be unsuitable hosts since the essential secretory and processing activity may also be active in a cells.Finally, while expression of novel DNA sequences in the above illustrative examples was under control of an endogenous MFa promoter regulator within the copy of the cloned genomic MPa specifying DNA, it is expected that other yeast promoter DNA sequences may be suitably employed. Appropriate promoters may include yeast PGK and ADH l promoters or the G3PDH promoter of applicantls co pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 412,707, filed August 3, 1982. Although the above examples relate specifically to constructions involving DNA sequences associated with endogenous MFa secretion into yeast cell growth media, it will be understood that the successful results obtained strongly indicate the likelihood of success whenDNA sequences associated with other yeast secreted polypeptides as noted above are employed. In this regard, substantial benefits in polypeptide isolation are expected to attend intracellular secretory processing of exogenous polypeptides into yeast periplasmic spaces as well as into yeast growth media. Numerous modifications and variations in the invention as represented by the above illustrative examples are expected to occur to those skilled in the art, and consequently only such limitations as appear in the appended claims should be placed upon the invention.The features disclosed in the foregoing description, in the following claims and or in the accompanying drawings may, both separately and in any combination thereof, be material for realising the invention in diverse forms thereof.
