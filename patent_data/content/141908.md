# Data processing apparatus.

## Abstract
A data processing apparatus comprises a plurality of sub systems 30a 30d each including at least one arithme tic unit 38a 38d , a plurality of registers 35a 35d , a first selector 33a 33d for receiving vector data and selectively outputting the input data to the registers, and a second se lector 34a 34d for receiving the vector data from the regis ters and selectively outputting the input data to a plurality of output lines. The data output of the arithmetic unit in each sub system is supplied to the first selector in the same sub system and the first selector in other sub system, and the arithmetic unit in each sub system receives the output data from the second selector in the same sub system. The data output from the second selector in at least one sub system is supplied to a main storage unit 10 , and the data output from the main storage unit is supplied to the first selector in at least one sub system.
