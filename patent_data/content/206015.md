## Description
Waste lubricating oils contain asphaltum type impurities and cracked oil residues chat have to be removed when reclaiming the oils for reuse. During this reclaiming process, a considerable amount of sludge is produced which is normally discarded. Finding a way to make commercial use of this sludge and, at the same time, reap benefits front the point of view of the protection of the environment, has represented a very interesting problem. Both today as in the past, great amounts of this sludge accumulate at waste oil reclaiming plants and in other more or less makeshift storage areas, giving off offensive odors, threatening to pollute water sources and otherwise adversely affecting the environment and nearby communities. Selective solvents, such as propane, have been recently used in the waste oil reclaiming process. It is therefore the specific problem and task of the present invention to find a beneficial use for those sludges resulting from waste oil reclamation or reprocessing which will be sound both economically and ecologically and provide a safe final disposal of those sludges. To this purpose, in accordance with the basic idea of the present invention, there is provided a composition useful in road surfacing, waterproofing of materials, sealing of dams and other applications when said composition is mixed with bitumen, said composition comprising a sludge obtained from waste lubricating oil reclamation, an elastomer component selected from the group consisting of EPDM and SBS copoymers, and a hardening product consisting of isotactic polypropylene. There are several types of reclamation processes known in the art, and sludges obtained from these various known reclamation processes may be used for the purposes of the present invention. More particularly, in accordance with an advantageous embodiment of the invention said sludge component used in said composition of the present invention may consist of sludges from waste lubricating oil reclamation by means of selective solvents. In accordance with an alternative embodiment said sludge component of the composition of the present invention inay consist of sludges obtained from waste lubricating oil reclamation by means of a sulfuric acid treatment followed by neutralization. The invention also relates to methods for preparing the composition and bituminous conglomerates utilizing the ternary composition of the present invention as a constituent additive to bituminous mixtures. Such methods are defined in claims 5 12. In connection with improving the general characteristics of bitumen compositions, French specification 2 228 817 SIPLAST discloses the use of EPDM copolymers as an elastomer additive and of isotactic or atactic polypropylene as a solvent component. In this known procedure, the polypropylene component is proposed as a solvent component to facilitate the use of EPDM as an elastomer additive, in replacement of former polymer additives which had been limited to polymers of low viscosity and hence of low molecular weight and or low ramification type polymers. French specification 2 288 127 Shell discloses the addition of used lubricating oil as such, which is considered to be a waste product, to bitumen, whereby to obtain a bituminous product with advantageous properties and qualities for particular purposes. The reference exclusively contemplates addition of the used up lubricating oils as such, and maintains that waste oil reprocessing is not a feasible process. Instead, by means of the present invention, the sludge refuse of waste oil reclaiming processes can be turned into a useful product. This is best accomplished by starting out with the aforementioned type of sludge obtained when solvents are used in the waste oil reclaiming process. This type of sludge is doughy and contains asphaltum substances and cracked oil carbonaceous fractions, as well as lubricating oil fractions, polymer additive fractions and metallic fractions. The very small amount of inorganic material contained in the sludge has about 18 25 ash content and a P. A. softening point of about 104 105 C. It was discovered that this type of sludge is compatible with elastomers and hardeners, and that at the appropriate temperature they can be easily mixed together to form a high quality product for use as an additive for bitumens. The S.B.S. type elasticizer can be used, for example, but E.P.D.M. copolymers are preferred because of their resistance to atmospheric agents, low and high temperatures and light. Isotactic polypropylene was selected as the hardener because of its low cost, excellent compatibility and high efficiency. The most optimum formula for preparing a specific binding compound for bituminous conglomerates used in surface pavings in general, including road surfaces, is given below. This optimal compound whose very special characteristics as a binder, also in other applications, are described further on is obtained by hot mixing the sludge as is with the other components, in the following proportions The mixture is mechanically mixed at ca. 200 250 rpm and heated to 180 190 C. Powdered ethylene propylene copolymer 600 800 µm is first added and stirred in until the mixture is homogeneous. Then powdered isotactic polypropylene 600 800 µm is added and stirred in until the compound is homogeneous. The resulting product is quite doughy, has good elasticity and a very high P. A. softening point 183 185 C . The most important applications of this optimal compound are as follows The best method for this application, since the compound is in the solid state and considering the particular operational procedures involved, is to first mix 20 25, 30 or 40 of the optimal compound according to the particular job requirement with distilled bitumen of the type 180 200 and then prepare small loaves of this mixture. Prepared in this manner the ready to use loaves can be mixed with and melted by the hot aggregate 160 180 C , such as sand, stone and various fillers, which is fed into the conglomerate mixing unit. With a proportion of 6 binder and 94 inert material, the conglomerate will contain the desired solid amount of the aforesaid optimal compound . The preferred amount of optimal compound to add to the distilled bitumen of the type 180 200, when preparing the aforesaid loaves is 25 The addition of loaves having this composition to the conglomerate will provide a resistance to temperatures ranging from 25 C to 150 C. It was observed that the plasticizers, elastomers and hardeners used in the preparation of bituminous mixtures for waterproofing cardboard, felt, joints and sleeves, can all be replaced by the aforesaid optimal compound . This product by itself, therefore, does the job of all three of the components that are normally added to the required bituminous mixture, which represents savings of both cost and time. The amount of optimum compound added to the distilled bitumen of the types 180 200 or 80 100 can vary between 20 and 40 The aforesaid optimal compound can advantageously substitute PRA in the preparation of sealers for dams or similar applications. The reason for this is that it is the only product that melts easily at 180 190 C while being mechanically agitated. The results of the tests carried out on samples of bituminous conglomerate used for road surfacing, as described in the foregoing section A , are given below by way of proof of the validity and novelty of this invention. The four parameters generally used for the evaluation of products of this type are shown, with the first column showing the results obtained in the tests and the second column showing the values for the products that have been normally used to date. The obtained penetration index of 5, which indicates the susceptibility of a bitumen to temperature, is exceptionally high and is of particular interest as regards the product concerning this invention. There are great quantities of sludges now on the market that have been obtained from the old method of waste oil reclaiming, where the waste oil is first subjected to a sulfuric acid treatment and then neutralized using lime. In contrast to the sludges obtained using solvents, these sludges have a high inorganic content, which does not make them very suitable for making waterproofing compounds for cardboard, felt and the like, or for making sealing compounds for dams and similar applications. On the other hand, as regards the road surfacing application this high inorganic content of the acidified and neutralized sludges makes them more suitable because the inert material contributes to the aggregates normally added to the conglomerate. The disadvantage of these abundantly available acidized and neutralized sludges is that they cannot be used for road surfacing in countries that are either very warm or very cold, because at these extreme temperatures maximum strengths cannot be obtained. Another disadvantage of these sludges regards the use of the compound. The high inorganic content inhibits the making of the ready made loaves for use on the site together with the hot aggregates for making the conglomerate. Consequently another optimal compound similar to the one obtained with the sludge treated with solvents has to be made. Since the inorganic content of this optimal compound is high which does not permit making the aforesaid loaves by melting the said compound into the type 180 200 distilled bitumen it has to be powdered to a grain size measuring less than 1000 Nm usually about 500 800 µm . In this powdered form, the optimal compound is ready for being mixed together with melted bitumen at high temperature, of the type 180 200, which is added to the aggregate. The amount of binder is still about 6 .
