## Description
The invention relates to a safety tile comprising a concrete bottom tile and a rubber cover tile being anchored in the concrete bottom tile by means of anchoring pins integral with the cover tile whilst leaving free air cavities. Such a safety tile is known from Dutch patent application 72.00920. Although such a tile has a satisfying effect in practice, there is a eed for a safety tile having a higher damping value than the existing file, particularly in the zones of neighbouring tiles. Therefore, the invention has for its object to provide a safety tile having a higher damping value than the tile hitherto known. According to the invention this is achieved by inserting the anchoring pins into openings in the bottom tile and anchoring them by means of guard elements. Since the anchoring pins are no longer embedded in the concrete of the bottom tile, but arranged to be, in principle, freely movable in a vertical sense, the damping value of the tile embodying the invention is considerably enhanced. The tile referred to in the preamble has a limited damping value, in particular in the zone around the anchoring points. This is due to the fact that the anchoring pin is rigidly connected with the concrete tile. The guard elements are preferably made from flexible material. In this way the anchoring pins can perform some movement in a direction of length. The guard elements may, for example, be formed by rubber rings glued to the anchoring pins. As an alternative the guard elements may be formed by pins passed through the anchoring pins in a transverse directiAs a further alternative transversely directed elements integral with the anchoring pins may be used, which snap into the openings in the concrete tile. In order to obtain a safety tile with a flat underside the guard elements are preferably located in depressions in the bottom tile. A safety tile embodying the invention can be obtained by making a concrete bottom tile, making a rubber cover tile with anchoring pins, sliding the bottom tile onto the cover tile and arranging the guard elements. Since in the safety tile embodying the invention the cover tile is no longer firmly anchored in the concrete tile, it is possible to further improve the damping value especially in the peripheral zone. According to the invention this is achieved by choosing the length of the side edges of the covey tile to be smaller than the overall thickness of the safety tile. Thus the side edge is free of the substrate and is, therefore, capable of performing a vertical movement. The invention will be set out with reference to the drawing showing an embodiment. The drawings show in Fig.1 a sectional view of a safety tile embodying the invention, Fig.2 a detail of the safety tile embodying the invention in a sectional view, the guard element being a rubber pin or the like, Fig.3 a sectional view of a detail of a safety tile embodying the invention, the guard element being a rubber or synthetic resin ring, Fig.4 a sectional view of a concrete bottom tile associated with the safety tile embodying the invention. The safety tile embodying the invention comprises a rubber cover layer 1 applied to a concrete bottom tile 6. On the side facing the concrete bottom tile the rubber cover layer is provided with pinshaped spacers 2,3,4 and anchoring pins 5.The spacers as well as the anchoring pins are integral with the cover layer. It is noted here that other forms of spacers may be chosen rather than spacers in the form of pins. The anchoring pin 5 is passed through an opening 7 in the concrete bottom tile 6. This also applies to the anchoring pin 8, which is passed through an associated opening 9. In order to couple the rubber cover layer with the concrete bottom tile guard elements are arranged on the anchoring pins 5,8. These guard elements may have different shapes. Fig.2 shows that the guard elements have the form of a transverse pin 10 passed through the anchoring pin 5. Fig.3 shows that the guard elements have the shape of a guard ring 11 slipped around the anchoring pin and glued to the anchoring pin.In order to obtain a flat underside of the safety tile the concrete bottom tile has openings widened on the underside by depressions 12,13 as shown in Fig.4. These recesses may, as an alternative, have a conical shape. In the safety tile embodying the invention the cover layer is connected with the concrete bottom tile in a manner such that the anchoring pins of the cover layer may perform some longitudinal movement. This results in an appreciable improvement of the damping value in the zone around the anchoring pins. In a further embodiment of the safety tile according to the invention the side rims 14, 15 grip around the entire side edge of the concrete bottom tile 17. In this way anchoring is improved, whilst nevertheless a vertical movement remains possible. A further improvement of the damping value in the peripheral zones is obtained in that the length of the side rim 14 Fig.1 is smaller than the overall thickness of the safety tile 16. Thus the side rim can perform a vertical movement. By disposing two similar safety tiles closely to one another a satisfactory damping value is obtained also at the boundary face of adjoining tiles owing to the contacting side rim of the rubber cover layer. By providing recesses 18 in the side rims of the tile a given horizontal expansion is allowed. These recesses may cover the entire length of the side rims in order to improve water drainage. The safety tile embodying the invention can be made more easily and accurately than the known safety tile. Moreover the water drainage is improved.
