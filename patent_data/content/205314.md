# Structures for enclosed transfer of persons.

## Abstract
Apparatus for providing a vector connection between openings 4 in an enclosed walkway 3 and an adjacent structure. The apparatus 8 is mountable at the walkway opening to vector seal between the walkway and the appar atus. A tubular sealing part of flexible material provides a passageway with open ends for surrounding the walkway opening and structure opening, and a plurality of expandable chambers extend peripherally about the passageway. Expan sion of the chambers flexes the sealing part causing it to project from the walkway and abut with a surface of an adja cent structure and surround the structure opening, whilst contraction of the chambers retract the sealing part from the structure back to adjacent the walkway opening. At least one of the chambers is adjacent the open end of the passageway near the structure and deforms as necessary upon abutment of the sealing part with the structures so that the sealing part conforms to the structure surface and vector seals completely about the structure opening.
