## Description
This invention relates to anthraquinone dyes and liquid crystal compositions including said anthraquinone dyes therein. More in detail, this invention relates to special anthraquinone dyes suitable for use in electro optical devices which have a liquid crystal composition including at least one dye between two electrode plates placed in opposite to each other and make it possible to provide good color display by using a so called guest host effect of the liquid crystal and also relates to liquid crystal compositions containing these anthraquinone dyes. Pleochroic dyes can be divided into two types. One type of the dyes are those in which the transition moment of visible light absorption is almost parallel to the axis direction of the dye molecule and which, when dissolved as a guest molecule in a host liquid crystal, has a property that the axis of the dye molecule and the direction of the liquid crystal molecules are substantially in the same direction. These dyes are called as those having parallel dichroism or P type dyes . The other type of the dyes are those in which transition moment of visible light absorption is almost perpendicular to the molecular axis of the dye molecule and which, when dissolved in a host liquid crystal as a guest, has a property that the axis of the dye molecule and the direction of the liquid crystal molecules are oriented substantially in the same direction. These dyes are called as those having perpendicular dichroism or N type dyes . Of these two types, this invention relates to the former type dyes which have parallel dichroism and liquid crystal compositions containing these dyes. Features of the pleochroic dyes are that the absorption intensity of light of the dye molecule can be determined depending on relative directions of absorption transition moment of the molecule and electric vector of light. That is, when the direction of absorption transition moment is parallel to the electric vector of light, the absorption intensity becomes maximum, while in perpendicular, the absorption intensity becomes minimum. When a nematic, cholesteric or smectic liquid crystal containing such a pleochroic dye is interposed between two opposed electrode plates and an electric potential is applied across the electrodes, a disturbing movement of the liquid crystal molecules is caused, or a molecular alignment oriented in the direction of electric field is formed, depending on dielectric properties and flowability of the liquid crystal. Under such conditions, the pleochroic dye molecules also move together with the liquid crystal molecules, causing a change in the relative relation between the direction of the absorption transition moment of the pleochroic dye molecules and the direction of incident light. As a result, the liquid crystal display undergoes a change in its light absorption properties. This phenomenon is well known as guest host effect , and an electrically controllable color display device can be constructed utilizing this effect. For example, when a nematic liquid crystal having a positive dielectric anisotropy and containing a pleochroic dye showing parallel dichroism is inteposed between two transparent electrode plates, the surfaces of which contacting with the liquid crystal have been subjected to homogeneous orientation treatment and which are positioned in parallel to face each other, the liquid crystal molecules form a so called homogeneous alignment wherein the long axes of the molecules are aligned in a constant direction parallel with the electrode planes. See Fig. 1. In this situation, the pleochroic dye molecules dissolved in the liquid crystal molecules 5 are also aligned so that their long axes are also in parallel and constant with the electrode planes. When white light 6, which has travelled in a direction perpendicular to an electrode plane and polarized by a polarizing plate 8 to the same direction as the alignment direction of the liquid crystal, is transmitted through the guest host material having such an alignment as mentioned above, the electric vector of incident white light is paralleled with the long axes of the pleochroic dye molecules, and hence a specific wavelength region of the incident light is particularly strongly absorbed by the pleochroic dye molecules. As a result, the guest host material takes a strongly colored state. In the next place, when an electric field is applied to the liquid crystal material in the above mentioned alignment through the transparent electrode plates 3, since the host liquid crystal has a positive dielectric anisotropy, the host liquid crystal molecules 4 and the guest pleochroic dye molecules 5 take a homeotropic alignment wherein the axes of the molecules are perpendicularly aligned with respect to the electrode planes. See Fig. 2. In this situation, since the long axes of the pleochroic dye molecules are perpendicular to the electric vector of incident white polarized light 6, the incident light is hardly absorbed by the pleochroic dye molecules, which results in making the guest host material appeared to be in a weakly colored state. By applying the difference in the strongly colored state and weakly colored state, it becomes possible to provide a display by electrical driving. In Figs. 1 and 2, numeral 1 denotes an observer, 2 a transparent glass substrate, 7 polarizing directions of incident light and 9 incident natural light. The pleochroic dyes used as guest in liquid crystal displays applying the above mentioned guest host effect are required to have the following properties Among these properties, the order parameter usually expressed by the mark S mentioned in 1 indicates the degree of parallel of the dye molecule absorption axis against the orientational direction of the host liquid crystal molecules and can be defined as follows In the above equation, the term of cos²ϑ is timewise averaged and ϑ is an angle between the dye molecule absorption axis and the orientational direction of host liquid crystal molecules. The order parameter S of pleochroic dye molecules can be obtained experimentally by the following equation Wherein A As to the desired hue or coloring mentioned in 2 , it is necessary to make the range of hue or coloring which can be selected as wide as possible from the standpoints of coloring the display considering an increase in the amount of display information, an increase in the degree of free for design, and an improvement in decorative properties. Fundamentally, if the three primary colors, i.e., yellow, magenta and cyan, can be obtained, it becomes possible to give all the colors by subtractive color mixing. Thus, the three primary colors of yellow, magenta and cyan become important. Therefore, the production of pleochroic dyes satisfying the requirements 1 , 3 and 4 mentioned above is desired at present. EP A 0 034 832 discloses pleochroic anthraquinone dyes for liquid crystal compositions. The substituents of the anthraquinone molecule providing its suitability for liquid crystal compositions are, however, fixed to specific positions not only in the molecule, but also in relation to each other 2 and 6 position or 3 and 7 position, respectively , which renders the synthesis of such dyes more difficult. This invention provides pleochroic dyes easily obtainable in relatively high yields and satisfying the requirements 1 , 3 and 4 and a liquid crystal composition comprising a host liquid crystal material and such anthraquinone dyes dissolved in said host liquid crystal material. This invention provides a pleochroic anthraquinone dye having the formula wherein R⁷ is hydrogen, an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, an aryl group or an aralkyl group, where said aryl group is represented by the formula wherein R ₇ is hydrogen, a C where n is an integer of 1 to 9 R⁶ is a C wherein R¹⁰ is hydrogen, a C or a halogen or a dialkylamino group wherein R⁹ is hydrogen, a C This invention also provides a liquid crystal composition comprising a host liquid crystal material and at least one guest authraquinone dye dissolved in said host liquid crystal material, said anthraquinone dye having the formula wherein R⁷, R⁶, R⁹, R¹⁰, R¹¹ and m are as defined above.

As the host liquid crystals usable in this invention, there can be used those which show nematic state in the operation temperature range. These host liquid crystals can be selected from a considerably wide range. Further, these nematic liquid crystals can take a cholesteric state by the addition of one or more optically active substances mentioned below. Examples of the nematic liquid crystals are those shown in Table 1 or their derivatives. In the above Table 1, R is an alkyl group or an alkoxy group and X is a nitro group, a cyano group, or a halogen atom. All the liquid crystals in Table 1 have positive dielectric anisotropy. But there can also be used conventional liquid crystals having negative dielectric anisotropy such as ester series, azoxy series, azo series, Schiff base series, pyrimidine series, diester series, and biphenyl ester series by mixed with those having positive dielectric anisotropy to give a mixture having positive dielectric anisotropy as a whole. Needless to say, even liquid crystals having negative dielectric anisotropy can be used as they are if a suitable device constitution and a driving method are used. As the host liquid crystals, those listed in Table 1 or their derivatives can be used in this invention alone or as a mixture thereof.

The liquid crystal composition of this invention can be used in any conventional liquid crystal display devices. Such devices usually have a structure wherein a pair of glass substrates at least one of which is transparent are placed in parallel via a spacer and transparent electrodes having desired pattern are formed on the glass substrates facing each other. In such a case, the gap between the glass substrates is determined by the spacer. The gap is usually 3 to 100 µm, and particularly preferably 5 to 50 µm from the viewpoint of practical use. This invention is illustrated by way of the following Examples. The colors and order parameters of anthraquinone dyes were measured through the Examples as follows. To a phenylcyclohexane series liquid crystal mixture ZLI 1132 mentioned above, each pleocroic dye was added and heated at 70 C or higher. The mixture was stirred well when it became an isotropic liquid, followed by cooling while allowed to stand and repetition of these steps in order to dissolve the dye. The thus prepared liquid crystal composition was poured into a liquid crystal display device which was constructed by two glass substrates having thereon transparent electrodes and cured polyamide resin coating having been subjected to homogeneous orientation treatment by rubbing to contact with the liquid crystal composition, and spaced with a spacer with a gap of 10 to 100 µm, followed by sealing. When no voltage is applied, the liquid crystal composition take a homogeneous orientation state in the display device having been subjected to orientation treatment mentioned above as shown in Fig. 1, wherein the dye molecules and the host liquid crystal molecules take the same orientation. Absorption spectra of the thus prepared guest host display devices were measured by using a light polarized in parallel to the orientation direction of the host liquid crystal molecules and a light polarized perpendicularly to obtain absorbances of A To 50 ml of N methylpyrrolidone, 1.4 g of a mixture of 1 amino 2 bromo 4 hydroxyanthraquinone 6 carboxylic acid and 1 amino 2 bromo 4 hydroxyanthraquinone 7 carboxylic acid about 1 1 by weight , 1.8 g of p n butylphenol and 1.8 g of potassium carbonate were added and heated at 120 125 C for 7 hours with stirring. After cooling to 60 to 70 C, the mixiture was poured into 100 g of ice water, followed by separation of the product and washing with water until neutral was obtained. The product thus obtained was dried to give 1.5 g of a mixture of 1 amino 2 p n butylphenoxy 4 hydroxyanthraquinone 6 carboxylic acid and 1 amino 2 p n butylphenoxy 4 hydroxyanthraquinone 7 carboxylic acid. To 30 ml of o dichlorobenzene, 1.0 g of the mixture thus obtained, 1.8 g of trans 4 n butylcyclohexanol and 0.2 g of p toluenesulfonic acid were added and heated at 110 to 115 C for 24 hours with stirring. After removing the o dichlorobenzene by distillation under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by column chromatography using silica gel as carrier and chloroform as separating solvent to give 0.5 g of a 1 1 mixture of 1 amino 2 p n butylphenoxy 4 hydroxy 6 carboxylic acid trans 4 n butylcyclohexyl ester and 1 amino 2 p n butylphenoxy 4 hydroxy 7 carboxylic acid trans 4 n butylcyclohexyl ester. The resulting mixture had a maximum absorption wavelength in visible region of 534 nm and an order parameter S of 0.74. Further, 0.45 g of the mixture mentioned above was separated and purified by column chromatography using silica gel C 200, a trade name, manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. as carrier and toluene as separating solvent. Initially, 0.2 g of a dye No. 1a fraction a having a melting point of 193 to 194 C was separated and then 0.2 g of a dye No. 1b fraction b having a melting point of 152 to 153 C was separated. Maximum absorption wavelengths of these dyes in visible region were measured in the same manner as mentioned above. That is, the dye No. 1a in an amount of 0.39 by weight was added to a liquid crystal mixture ZLI 1132 to prepare a liquid crystal composition. The liquid crystal composition was sealed in a display device having a gap of 50 µm between the two substrates. Absorption spectra were measured as mentioned above. The maximum absorption wavelength in visible region was 535 nm as shown in Fig. 3 and A On the other hand, the dye No. 1b in an amount of 1.05 by weight was added to a liquid crystal mixture ZLI 1132 to prepare a liquid crystal composition. The liquid crystal composition was sealed in a display device having a gap of 10 µm between the two substrates. Absorption spectra were measured as mentioned above. The maximum absorption wavelength in visible region was 534 nm as shown in Fig. 4 and A Dyes shown in Table 3 were prepared in the same manner as described in Example 2. Melting points, maximum absorption wavelengths and order parameters S of the resulting mixtures and separated isomers in the same manner as described in Example 2 were measured and listed in Table 3. Dyes shown in Table 4 were prepared in the same manner as described in Example 2. Maximum absorption wave lengths and order parameters S of these dyes 1 1 mixture of isomers having COOR⁶ at the 6 position or 7 position were measured and listed in Table 4.
