# Apparatus and methods for multi channel signal recording.

## Abstract
A multi channel signal recorder e.g. a multi track tape recorder records a greater number of channels than number of tracks available on the recorder. This is achieved by inputting the channels to individual buffer stores in a data memory 4 and then transferring in cyclic sequence the contents of a number of buffer stores recorded over preset periods of time as blocks of signal to a common record track at rates which are faster than the input rate by a number of times at least equal to the number of buffer stores feeding a track. Marker signals may be inserted between successive blocks.
