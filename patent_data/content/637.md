# Method and apparatus for making fibrils of a thermoplastic polymer.

## Abstract
Fibrils of a thermoplastic polymer are produced. A mixture of the termoplastic and a liquid, e.g. water and pentane or hexane, flows through a valve from a high to a low pressure zone. The valve contains a spring biased closure member which interrupts the flow when the pressure in the high pressure zone is too low. At low pressure the flow is unstable and the formation of fibrils is unsatisfactory. A preferred apparatus takes the form of an extruder having a spring loaded closure member on the die. The spring stops the extrusion when the pressure in the extruder is too low for satisfactory flash evaporation.
