# Improvements in or relating to the squeeze casting of articles.

## Abstract
A squeeze casting press has a movable top die part 11 and movable side die parts 13 . When these parts are in a die forming position, the side die parts 13 are locked against movement by respective locking wedges 25 to prevent these die parts separating under the squeeze casting pressure. The provision of movable die side parts allows easy access to the cast article which may be a piston for an engine or a com pressor . It also allows easy location in the die of reinforce ments or inserts to be cast into the article.
