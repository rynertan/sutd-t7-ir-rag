# Method and apparatus for colourmetric evaluation of photographic film.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for correcting colour deficien cies in release prints produced from a motion picture film consists of colourmetrically analysing the colour film. The steps involved include selecting a variable light source arranged to selectively adjust each of the three primary col ours to form a composite light beam having the required chroma and intensity, applying it to a frame of the film to form a visual image, adjusting the chroma of the light beam to modify the colour chracteristics of the image, recording information representative of the adjustments to the three primary colours made to the light source and generating electronic video signals representative of the modified image and recording signals. The stored video signals are then used to control a television to visually reproduce the modified image.
