# Gas meters.

## Abstract
A gas meter of the kind in which gas is directed in a specific direction through a gas measuring device will not record gas flow correctly if the gas flow is reversed. According to the invention a one way valve 17 is fitted into the gas path, e.g. an exhaust tube 14 , so that gas flow is shut off if the gas flow is reversed. The valve may be a pivoted flap valve or a ball valve.

## Claims
Claims 1. A gas meter of the kind having a gas path or paths therethrough and a counting device which records gas flowing in one direction through said path or paths, characterized by the inclusion of one or more one way valve means 17, 22, 36 fitted into the path or paths so that gas is allowed to flow only in said one direction, the valve means shutting off gas flowing in the reverse direction. 2. A gas meter as claimed in claim 1, further characterized by said one way valve means comprising a flap valve 16 co operating with a seat 18 and pivoted so that gas flowing in said one direction lifts it off its seat. 3. A gas meter as claimed in claim 2, further characterized by said one way valve means 17 being fitted into a common exhaust tube 14 through which gas leaves the meter. 4. A gas meter as claimed in claim 2, further characterized by said one way valve means 17 being fitted one into each of two paths leading from respective valve grids 31, 32 to a common exhaust tube 35 through which gas leaves the meter. 5. A gas meter as claimed in claim 1, further characterized by said one way valve means comprising a lightweight ball 24 co operating with a part spherical seat 23 such that gas flowing in said one direction lifts the ball off said seat. 6.

## Description
Gas Meters.This invention relates to gas meters of the kind in which the gas is directed in a specific direction through a gas measuring device, e.g. one in which a diaphragm is driven back and forth by the gas pressure. Such gas meters have counting devices which will not record gas flow correctly if the gas flow is in the reverse direction, either not counting at all or counting in a negative sense. One example of a gas meter of this kind is described in our co pending E.P.O. Patent Application No. 80301847.2.This invention provides a gas meter of the kind having a gas path or paths therethrough and a counting device which records gas flowing in one direction through said path or paths characterized by the inclusion of one way valve means fitted into the path or paths so that gas is allowed to flow only in said one direction, the valve means shutting off gas flowing in the reverse direction.Such valve means may comprise a pivoted flap valve or a ball member cooperating with a seat.The said valve means may be incorporated in an exhaust tube connected to the outlet of the gas meter. Alternatively it may be incorporated in the gas path adjacent valve gear of the meter.Three specific embodiments of the invention are shown in the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic section through a gas meter including a one way valve, Figure 2 is a detail of the valve of Figure 1, Figure 3 is a diagrammatic section through another gas meter including a one way valve, Figure 4 is a detail of the valve of Figure 3, Figure 5 is a plan view of the valve gear of a gas meter, and Figure 6 is a side section through the valve gear of Figure 5. Referring first to Figures 1 and 2, a gas meter 11 is of the kind in which gas is admitted through an inlet 12 , passes through a measuring system not shown and leaves through an outlet 13 . The measuring system may comprise one or more diaphragms which are driven back and forth by the flowing gas, the consequent movement driving a counter which records the total volume of gas flowing. Should connections 12 and 13 be reversed then either the counter will not record at all or else it may work backwards so showing a continuous decrease in the total recorded.This invention is concerned with preventing gas flowing in the reverse direction through the meter so that the faulty connections will be detected and corrected. The outlet 13 is connected to an exhaust tube 14 forming part of the gas path through the meter. The exhaust tube is a moulded plastic tube as seen best in Figure 2. Internally the tube is formed with a shoulder 15 which forms a location for a one way valve 17 . The valve is of the kind having a pivoted flap member 16 , with a limited freedom to move away from its seat 18 to allow gas flow in the direction of arrow A. As can be seen from inspection of Figure 2, a gas flow in the direction A tends to lift the flap member 16 off its seat, while gas flow in an opposite direction pushes the flap member 16 onto its seat and cuts off the flow.Therefore if the meter were incorrectly connected with the outlet 13 and inlet 12 reversed, little or no gas would flow and it would be obvious that something was wrong.The inlet 12 may have a tilt detecting device 20 connected to it, said device being described in more detail and claimed in our co pending U.K.Patent Application No. 8101905.An alternative form of one way valves shown in Figures 3 and 4, which show a gas meter similar to that of Figures 1 and 2, with a similar inlet 12 and outlet 13 . A plastic moulding 21 forms an exhaust tube connected to the outlet 13 , and this exhaust tube carries the one way valve 22 .As seen best in Figure 4, the exhaust tube is formed with an internal shoulder 23 which has a part spherical top surface forming the seat for a valve member 24 . The valve member is a light, hollow plastic ball which, when the valve is closed, rests on the seat. When gas flows in the direction of arrow B the ball is lifted off the seat. The diameter of the ball is sufficiently smaller than the internal diameter of the exhaust tube to allow normal gas flow. A retaining circlip 25 limits the potential movement of the ball. When the inlet and outlet connections are reversed, gas begins to flow in the reverse direction. This pushes the ball 24 onto the seat 23 and shuts off the flow.Although the one way valves have been shown connected in the exhaust tubes, they could be connected to the inlet of the gas meter. Referring now to Figures 5 and 6, a gas meter 30 is of the kind in which a pair of diaphragms not shown are driven back and forth in chambers not shown . A valve chest 33 is located above the chambers, providing valve grids 31, 32 . A pair of sliding valves not shown slide over grids 31, 32 so as to direct the gas flows in timed relationship between the chambers and an opening 34 connected to an exhaust tube 35 . The outlet paths from the chambers extend across the valve chest in the direction of arrows A. Each such path has a one way valve 36 connected therein adjacent the exhaust tube, the one way valves being flap valves similar to valve 17 of Figures 1 and 2. The one way valves operate in a similar manner to that described in relationship to Figures 1 and 2, closing when a flow in the reverse sense to that of arrows A occurs.
