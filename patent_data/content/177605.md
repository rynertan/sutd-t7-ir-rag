## Description
The invention is concerned with an enzyme composition promoting digestion in the fluids present within the gastrointestinal tract. In particular, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical enzyme composition for the In the present specification and claims, the term enzyme refers to an active enzyme unless otherwise stated. Digestion of ingested food starts in the mouth cavity and then goes on as the food passes through the stomach, the tract of the small intestine duodenum, jejunum, ileum and the colon. During this digestive process different enzymes act on different types of substrates in different regions The Mitchell Beazley Atlas of the Body and Mind, 1976 . Inadequate digestion may be caused by various kinds of disturbances in the gastrointestinal tract. Examples of such disturbances are There exist at present numerous pharmaceutical enzyme compositions which are to assist the digestive process in cases of pancreatic failure or insufficiency that is, these compositions are to enhance digestion in the duodenum. Pancreatin is an example of such a drug GB 1561613 . Enzymes derived from fish intestines and from other aquatic animals have likewise been described as digestion promoters FR 1015566 . Commercially available products are for example Combizym , Combizym comp., Festal , Luizym , all of them containing an extract from The problems inherent in prior art enzyme drugs are due to the fact that these drugs are unstable in the acidic gastric environment and are quite inefficient in degrading normal food ingredients. For this reason many of the compositions employed heretofore have been coated with a material resistant to gastric juice so that the enzymes are not released before they reach the duodenum. Inactivation may be avoided to some extent if the drugs are ingested together with food or are ingested in the form of compositions containing certain neutralizing salts but more often than not such combinations have proved to be unsatisfactory. Furthermore, some of the compositions used heretofore have been found to adversely affect the gastric mucosa. Aquatic animals belonging to the order of Chem. Abs. Vol. 98, 1983, No. 13723n Pol.

Soc. 1978, 7 2 , 78 87 discloses studies on the activities and stability of Antarctic krill proteases, Three proteases had lower proteolytic activity than the mammalium enzymes, whereas one protease had proteolytic activity in the same order of magnitude as that of bovine trypsin and chymotrypsin. Chem. Abs. Vol. 92, 1980, No. 116420r and 116421s JP A 79,119,017 and JP A 79,119,011 disclose the preparation of antihypertensive drugs from krill extracts. GB A 377, 128 describes ferment preparations produced from the pylorous attachments of fish and shell fish. The preparations was 1932 estimated to have a high proteolytic activity and are said to find technical applications and uses in pharmaceutical preparations. It is unknown to applicants if preparations according to GB A 377,128 have ever resulted in pharmaceutical preparations. Still more unknown is the specific medical indications that are contemplated. Objects of the invention are to provide improvements in enzyme based promoters of The invention thus relates to a pharmaceutical composition which contains an effective amount of water soluble proteinases extracted from an aquatic animal selected from the order The enzyme composition according to the present invention may also contain lipase activity and or amylase activity in admixture with various additives such as e.g. bile and various preparations of fluids from the duodenum and stomach. The lipase and or amylase activities may derive from these same aquatic animals or from other sources. The compositions will perform as potential aids in all kinds of metabolic processes Enzyme mixtures from the aforesaid animals may be obtained in high yields and in a simple manner. Useful sources for the enzyme formulation are animals of the order The most important enzyme activities in the context of the present invention originate from the alimentary tract of the animals. Various different forms of mixtures of enzyme activities may be obtained, depending on the manufacturing method employed. The enzymes are prepared from the animals by means of well known methods. Fresh or fresh frozen animals are homogenized and thus extracted with an aqueous medium e.g. water . The resultant extract may be lyophilized and stored. The extract may be purified further by e.g. extraction with a lipid dissolving solvent for lipid removal. If then still further purification is necessary this may be effected by gel filtration, ultrafiltration or membrane filtation, it being possible by means of these procedures to remove low molecular compounds containing for instance fluorine krill is known to be rich in fluorine . Other available purification steps to which recourse may be had are ion exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography. Extraction and homogenization should be performed in the cold, below or close to 5 The enzyme preparations obtained by aqueous extraction may be employed as such directly, or after further purification if required. In some cases it is advantageous to lyophilize a preparation from which lipids have been removed by extraction the powder thus obtained can be stored for a long time. The proteinases may for instance have molecular weights ranging from 20,000 to about 40,000 daltons e.g. trypsin like enzymes and carboxypeptidase A and B . As mentioned above these ranges apply to enzymes in a non aggregated form such as obtained upon aqueous extraction of the homogenized animals, the proteinases being soluble in water, such as for instance those that remain in the aqueous phase after the aforesaid extractions. According to the invention a mixture of hydrolytic enzymes are used, e.g. endopeptidases showing trypsin activity in combination with exopeptidases such as aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidase A and B. Digestion promoters used heretofore have been employed in various types of drug formulations. Those same types are useful also in the case of the present invention The compositions of the present invention may take the form of a paste, cream, gel, oil, solution, granulated material or capsule, pill, tablet, pellet, any of these latter if desired in a sustained release form etc. The most important medical formulations are Tablets, especially coated tablets capsules, especially capsules of a type that are resistant to gastric juice and pellets, especially microencapsulated pellets. However, within the scope of the present invention formulations that are not coated for gastric juice resistance may occasionally be of particularly great value, if this corresponds to the needs of an individual to be treated. Different types of formulations and or different types of coatings may be utilized for programming the compositions to release their activity in very specifically predetermined places within the gastrointestinal tract. The compositions may thus be coated with a layer providing resistance to gastric juice, and or they may be formulated so as to gradually release their activity during a prolonged period of time. For practical reasons oral drug formulations are preferred. In cases of pancreatic dysfunction the most important indication for digestion promoters the compositions employed are preferably formulated so as to be resistant to gastric juice. This type of formulations will provide optimum enzyme activity in the right place, i.e. in the duodenum or further down in the intestinal tract. With this type of preferred formulations the enzymes are released mainly after the compositions have passed through the stomach their release thus takes place in the intestines, preferably in the duodenum. In other words, the enzyme should be released at pH higher than 6.5. Techniques for manufacturing capsules, tablets, pellets etc. which are resistant to gastric juice and have predetermined release properties in intestinal juice have been known per se, cp. The Theory and Practice of Industrial Pharmacy Lachman L., Lieberman H. and Klanig J.L., 2nd Edition, Lea Febiger, Philadelphia, USA 1976 , p. 321 465. A formulation that is to be resistant to gastric juice should be of a quality such as to remain unaffected by simulated gastric juice during four hours at 37 Capsules of various sizes are commercially available. They usually consist of gelatin or some other material which is innocuous to the gastrointestinal tract. Filled capsules and compressed tablets are rendered resistant to gastric juice by being coated with an acid resistant film enteric coating . Furthermore, it may be noted that dissolution rates are determined also by the material of the capsule wall and by the carrier material employed. Thus for instance, it is possible to choose certain types of gelatin which are dissolved at the pH of the intestine but remain undissolved at the pH of the stomach. In such a case requirements are less strict as regards enteric coatings. The enteric film coating operation is carried out in that a film coating material which is resistant to gastric juice is dissolved in a volatile solvent and the solution is then sprayed onto filled capsules, tablets, pellets or the like. Such film coating materials are commercially available from numerous sources. They may consist of non toxic cellulose ethers or synthetic polymers. For preparing the compositions, an enzyme preparation obtained from the aforesaid aquatic animals may be combined with various known per se carriers additives which are physiologically acceptable. Suitable carriers are conventional constituents of tablets, capsules, granulates etc organic and inorganic materials such as silicone oils or other substances and mixtures bestowing desired properties on the composition. It is even possible, within the general concept of this invention, to employ aqueous solutions formed by combining the enzyme preparation with distilled water or physiological saline. Among additives of an active type may be mentioned bile salts and bile acids as aforesaid, as well as various preparations from gastric juice or intestinal juice. Coloring substances, flavoring agents, preservatives, emulsifiers, and salts of mildly alkaline reaction may also be added. The additives and carriers employed should be chosen such that they will not have any significant side effects on the intended promotion of the digestive processes. The dosage unit form of the composition may be chosen from among a variety of such forms. In the case of tablets, capsules etc. the weight of each dosage unit is usually less than 0.5 g, these dosage units being intended for administration in an amount of say 1 to 2 tablets to be ingested during or after meals e.g. 2 to 3 times per day. The final composition according to the present invention will normally contain protein from the aforesaid aquatic animals in an amount of from 0.0001 to 100 w w , e.g. from 0.001 to 90 w w . The exact amount will depend on the particular type of composition employed and on the specific enzyme activity per mg of animal protein. As regards the proteinase activity in the final composition, this will often be within a range of from 0.1 to 0.0001 enzyme units per mg but in some cases other activity per mg ranges may be obtained, depending on the purity of the enzyme preparation. The enzyme units as stated above are in µmol tyrosine equivalents per min., with casein as the substrate. Various embodiments of the invention will be illustrated below in a number of examples and will also be apparent from the appended claims. In some of the example fluids from the gastrointestinal tract have been employed. These have been collected from healthy individuals. In the examples the effect of the enzymatic digestion on the substrate is expressed as of the initial substrate weight. In the course of each experiment the weight of the substrate decreases due to enzymatic digestion and increases due to water adsorption which in turn depends on the degree of digestion. Positive values indicate liquefaction increase in tissue weight whereas negative values indicate a digestive effect decrease in tissue weight . The incubation temperature was 37 Krill For the removal of lipids from the extract 20 ml of CCl₄ is added to the pooled upper phase which is then homogenized in the cold 0 20 ml of the aqueous extract from A is chromatographed on Sephadex G 100 dextran crosslinked with epichlorohydrin, Pharmacia Fine Chemicals AB, Uppsala, Sweden in a column of 3.1 cm diameter and 69 cm in height. The column is equilibrated and eluted 30 ml per hour with Tris HCl buffer 0.05 m, pH 7.5 at 5 60 g of krill, The purified krill preparation used in the examples 3 11 as an aid for digestive processes contains endopeptidase and exopeptidase activities represented by trypsin and carboxypeptidase A and B, respectively. Preliminary measurements indicate the presence of carbohydrate splitting enzymes and phosphatases. A crude aqueous krill extract contains in addition to the above mentioned enzymes also an aminopeptidase Mw 120,000 150,000 dalton . The protease activities trypsin, carboxypeptidase A and B were determined for the purified extract according to the methods described in the reference list 1 3 . The total proteolytic activity was determined using denatured casein as a substrate 1,4 . The protein content was analysed using the Folin Ciocalteu phenol reagent according to the Lowry method 5 .

Each aliquot 0.1 0.2 g was weighed and added to 1 ml of freshly prepared enzyme solution test solution containing either lyophilized krill enzyme preparation 0.01 or 0.001 g ml, from Example 1B or Pankreon 0.01 or 0.001 g ml, Kali Chemie GmbH, Hannover, Germany . The test solutions were prepared by dissolving the enzyme preparations in distilled water. The pieces of meat, pre weighed, were introduced into the test solutions and incubated for varying periods of time as indicated in Table 2. After this exposure the meat was placed on a filter paper for 15 seconds whereupon it was weighed. Ocular inspection showed that the krill enzymes had transformed the meat in a manner substantially different from the effect of Pankreon . This experiment also included controls in the form of meat pieces incubated in water under identical experimental conditions. These results indicate that the krill enzyme preparation was a more potent meat digester than Pankreon . The procedure was the same as in Example 3 except that the enzyme preparation was dissolved in gastric juice rather than in water. The results of Examples 3 and 4 indicate that freshly collected gastric juice potentiates the effect exerted by the krill enzymes. This synergistic effect persists during the entire test period 14 hours showing that the krill enzymes are stable under these conditions. Preliminary results obtained with Pankreon are consistent with the information of its producer saying that its effect in gastric juice is poor. The procedure was the same as in Example 3 except that the enzyme composition was dissolved in a freshly prepared mixture of juices from the stomach and duodenum, rather than in water. These results and the conclusions to be drawn therefrom are analogous to those of Example 4. The procedure was the same as in Example 3 except that the meat was replaced by natural fat raw, adipose tissue as the substrate for the enzymes. These results show that krill enzymes are highly efficient in decomposing adipose tissue. The procedure was the same as in Example 6 except that the enzyme preparations were dissolved in gastric juice rather than in water. The results of Examples 6 and 7 show that freshly collected gastric juice potentiates the effect exerted by the krill enzymes. This synergistic effect persists during the entire test period showing that the krill enzymes are stable under these conditions. Preliminary results obtained with Pankreon are similar to the results reported in Example 4. The procedure was the same as in Example 6 except that the enzyme preparations were dissolved in a freshly prepared mixture of gastric and duodenal juices rather than in water. These results and the conclusions to be drawn therefrom are analogous to those of Example 7. Preliminary results with Pankreon did not indicate any substantial degradation as compared to the control. The procedure was the same as in Example 3 except that the enzyme preparations were dissolved in fresh saliva rather than in water. Thus according to these results the krill enzyme preparation studied gave a decrease in weight digestive effect . As regards Pankreon , preliminary results indicate that this gives merely an increase in weight liquefaction effect . The procedure was the same as in Example 9 except that the substrate was adipose tissue rather than meat. Skin biopsies weighing about 50 mg were exposed to krill enzymes in a concentration of 0.01 g ml. After a period of 24 hours the skin pieces had been digested completely and could no longer be seen in the test tubes. The same concentration of trypsin resulted after an equal length of time 24 hrs in an about 50 digestion. This study was carried out in conformity with Examples 3 for meat and 6 for adipose tissue . In the test solutions Pankreon and the krill enzymes had been replaced by 1 ml of the extract thawed as produced in accordance with Example 1C. No distilled water was added. Results meat After 8 to 10 hours the crude krill extract was observed to give a substantial decrease in weight digestive effect , according to a pattern similar to though somewhat weaker than that shown in Example 4 krill enzymes 0.001 g ml . Results adipose tissue In the beginning of each experiment both of the extracts studied gave a weight increase liquefaction during a continuous period which lasted for 10 hours in the case of the krill extract and for 12 hours in the case of the capelin extract. After this period a major decrease in weight digestive effect could be observed in the case of the krill extract, whereas only a weak decrease in weight digestive effect was observable in the case of the capelin extract.
