# CATHODE RAY TUBE CONVERGENCE MEASURING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A convergence measuring apparatus for e.g. a color tele vision kinescope 19 and deflection yoke 20 comprises means 23, 45, 46 for activating two of the electron beams of the kinescope to generate a convergence test pattern on the kinescope display screen. The convergence test pattern is a set of alternating color patches 11, 12, 13 . The degree of overlap 15 and gap 16 between patches is indicative of the degree of beam misconvergence. A monochrome television camera 21 observes the test pattern and provides a signal to a signal processor 22 which controls the electron beam acti vating means to move one color patch with respect to the other color to reduce the gap 16 and overlap 15 between patches. A measurement of the amount of patch movement necessary to minimize the overlap and gap between patches is an indication of electron beam misconvergence in the vicinity of the test pattern.
