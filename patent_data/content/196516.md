# Method for the dispersion of hard alpha defects in ingots of titanium for titanium alloy and ingots produced thereby.

## Abstract
A method consisting of a high temperature diffusion treatment, preferably preceded by a hot isostatic pressing treatment, by which the deleterious effects of hard alph defects may be substantially reduced or eliminated from ingots of titanium or titanium alloys without adversely affecting the subsequent structure and properties of ingots processed by the method an the homogenized, substantially hard alpha and inclusion free ingots produced thereby.
