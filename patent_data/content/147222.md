## Description
COnPQSITIO N FOR USE IN PRESERVIN G BYDROCABON PRODUCTS The present invention relates to a composition for use in preserving hydrocarbon products, in particular liquid products such as kerosene and other fuel oils. In the fuel oil industry there is increasing concern over problems resulting from microbiological contamination. While an aviation fuel oil is permitted by current aviation standards to contain no more than 30 ppm of water, the presence of even such small amounts of water can permit microbiological growth to occur. Thus, for example, in the case of oil filter coalescers associated with oil feed lines, these can become saturated with water and can thereby provide a site at which microbiological growth can take place.Furthermore, this growth can take place to such an extent that corrosion can occur, the filters become clogged, and the fuel oil line blocked. Although in some instances the results of this blocking may not be serious, in the case of say a fuel line to an aircraft engine, the results can be undesirable in the extreme.Also, infected coalescers can provide a source of subsequent contamination, even after a blockage has been cleared. Also, while a marine fuel oil can contain higher levels of water which can be introduced accidentally or deliberately to the fuel , such water again partitions and microbiological growth is common at the water fuel interface. Usually in marine fuel oils contamination is caused by growth of the fungus Cladosporium resinae, and in use of such oils contamination can again cause filter blockages, coalescer blockages and corrosion problems. We have now found surprisingly that a combination of certain tertiary alkyl or mixed alkyl aryl hydroperoxides, together with small amounts of one or more other biocides containing only carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, can provide a synergistic preservative effect in such hydrocarbon products, and prevent degradation due to microbial growth. We have also found that where the combination is to be used to preserve marine fuel oils a further biocide containing nitrogen and or sulphur may be provided at a low level and, in particular, that certain agricultural fungicides when used in very small amounts can enhance the synergism between the hydroperoxide and any biocide containing only carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. Accordingly, the present invention provides a composition for use in preserving hydrocarbon products such as aviation and marine fuel oils, which composition comprises an organic biocide containing carbon, hydrogen and oxygen only or a mixture of two or more such biocides, and at least one hydroperoxide of the formula EMI2.1 wherein R is an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon group, optionally together with a carrier solvent which is compatible with the product to be preserved. In the composition of the invention the said organic biocide should contain no nitrogen, sulphur or halogens, and generally must be a compound or mixture of compounds containing carbon, hydrogen and oxygen only.It must also be completely combustible giving rise to no residues or strongly acidic oxides or other acidic material apart from oxides of carbon. However, these criteria having been met the organic biocide may be any such biocide, although it is preferably an aldehyde such as formaldehyde including compounds which release formaldehyde or glyoxal, a dioxane such as a dimethoxane, and or a phenol, including phenol itself, naphthols and indanols. More preferably the or one of the organic biocides is a phenol of the formula EMI2.2 wherein m and n are the same or different and are each 1, 2 or 3 and R is hydrogen, alkyl, alkoxy, hydroxyalkyl, aryl, alkaryl or aralkyl. In the case where the organic biocide is a phenol of formula II and R is alkyl, alkoxy or hydroxyalkyl, any such group is preferably one containing from 1 to 7 carbon atoms. Preferably, however, R is alkyl, more preferably C1 to C7 alkyl, or aryl and m is 1. Thus, the preferred compositions of the invention may contain one or more alkyl phenols such as one or more of a heptyl phenol, a propyl phenol, o , m or p cresol or a xylenol or an aryl phenol such as o phenylphenol. An example of a propyl phenol biocide useful in the present invention is that sold commercially as a mixture of propylated phenols. Preferably, the composition of the invention is in liquid form. In that case, the biocide may be selected so that it provides a carrier solvent for the hydroperoxide of formula I or vice versa. Thus, for example, a biocidalsolvent may be provided by employing one or more liquid phenols such as a cresol or xylenol.Alternatively, or even additionally, a liquid carrier solvent which itself is a hydrocarbon product may be employed. In that case the solvent may be an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon solvent, and typically may be a kerosene such as ECS 2012 sold by Esso or a commercially available aviation fuel. In the composition of the invention, the hydroperoxide of formula I is preferably tertiary butyl hydroperoxide R methyl , tertiary amyl hydroperoxide R ethyl and or cumene hydroperoxide R phenyl . Most preferably, the hydroperoxide is tertiary butyl hydroperoxide for aviation fuel preservative compositions, and cumene hydroperoxide for other hydrocarbon fuel, e.g. marine fuel, preservative compositions. The composition of the invention generally may comprise any compatible mixture of the biocide and the hydroperoxide. Typically, however, a composition in accordance with the invention will comprise up to about 30 by weight of organic biocide and up to about 70 by weight of hydroperoxide of formula I. As a lower limit it may be said that the composition will generally include at least about 0.1 by weight of organic biocide, a preferred range being from about 0.1 to about 5 by weight of organic biocide. In addition, the composition will usually include at least about 5 , typically from about 5 to about 60 , by weight of hydroperoxide of formula I, a preferred range being from about 5 to about 30 by weight of hydroperoxide of formula I. Conveniently, the weight ratio of organic biocide to hydroperoxide of formula I may be up to about 1 5.Preferably, however, the weight ratio is much lower, typically at least about 1 10, and more preferably is about lit40. In a particularly preferred aspect, the composition for use in preserving fuel oils in accordance with the invention comprises from about 0.5 to about 28 or about 3 by weight of an alkylated phenol, together with from about 15 to about 20 or about 30 by weight of tertiary butyl or cumene hydroperoxide, in a fuel oil carrier solvent. In the composition of the invention, the ingredients of the composition other than hydroperoxide and the said biocide should be chosen so that they do not introduce into the fuel oil any unacceptable contamination. Thus, generally such ingredients will be free from halogens and free from or sufficiently low in nitrogen and sulphur to permit any necessary local regulations to be met. In the case of aviation fuels such regulations generally will be more stringent than say in the case of marine fuels, and usually will specify nitrogen and sulphur free requirements. Nevertheless, and particularly in the case of a marine fuel preservative, it is one preferred aspect of the invention to provide a composition including a nitrogen and or sulphur containing biocide, typically a fungicide, in addition to the hydroperoxide and the said organic biocide. Such a biocide may be included at very low levels, typically of less than 0.18 by weight e.g.about 100 ppm or less, and is preferably selected from the class of benzimidazole agricultural fungicides.Thus, for example, the additional biocide may be Benomyl, that is methyl l butylcarbamoyl 2benzimidazole carbamate Carbendazim, that is methyl 2 benzimidazolecarbamate and or Thiabendazol, that is 2 4 thiazolyl lH benzimidazole. Such a fungicide when used at the above defined levels may be employed with say about 30 by weight of peroxide, about 2 to about 3 by weight of biocide e.g.a phenol, and with the balance of the composition being a liquid carrier solvent. The composition of the invention is employed as a preservative by adding a suitable amount of the composition to a hydrocarbon product, such as a fuel oil, for example, in situ in a storage tank. While the fuel oil is in the tank situation, the ingredients of the composition will work at the water hydrocarbon interface to control and or eliminate undesirable microorganisms. The composition of the invention may be employed at dilutions in the product to be protected down to about 1 ppm. Alternatively, where say a storage tank is to be cleaned or sterilized, dilutions up to about 1 by weight may be employed. Generally, however, for control of microorganisms within a bulk hydrocarbon product the composition will be used at dilutions in the range of from about 1 ppm to about 500 ppm, preferably from about 10 to about 100 ppm. On the other hand, for problem situations the use dilution will be from about 0.18 to about 0.2 , and for tank cleaning also it is preferred to employ a dilution of about 0.2 by weight. The compositions of the invention are illustrated by the following specific Examples. Since tertiary butyl hydroperoxide as used in the invention is conventionally supplied as a 70 solution in water, the compositions of the invention may be blended by the following process technique 1. The aqueous tertiary butyl hydroperoxide solution is added to the carrier solvent to produce a two phase system. 2. The water phase is removed by a suitable separation technique e.g. by the use of a separating funnel, leaving the hydroperoxide dissolved in the carrier solvent. 3. The organic biocide s is added to the carrier solvent plus hydroperoxide, and the final mixture is either filtered or passed through a coalescer to remove any undissolved solids or residual water. Where the peroxide is not supplied as a 70 solution in water the separation step is omitted . Example 1 A preservative composition was formulated by blending as follows Ingredients Percent by weightA mixture of xylenols 0.5Tertiary butyl hydroperoxide 100 20ECS 2012 a kerosene containing 17 aromatics and sold by Esso balance to 100 Example 2 A preservative composition was formulated by blending as follows Ingredients Percents weight A mixture or xylenols enols Tertiary butyl hydroperoxide 100 20ECS 2012 balance to 100 Example 3 A preservative composition was formulated by blending as follows Ingredients Percent by weightA mixture of propylated phenols 0.5Tertiary butyl hydroperoxide 100 20ECS 2012 balance to 100 Example 4 A preservative composition was formulated by blending as follows Ingredients Percent by weight o Phenylphenol 1.6Tertiary butyl hydroperoxide 100 15.6ECS 2012 82.8 The above composition is useful both as an aviation fuel preservative and as a marine fuel preservative. As an aviation fuel preservative it can be employed at the following use dilutions, namely 1. At the point of manufacture of the fuel oil 100 ppm. 2. For problem situations 0.1 to 0.2 v v. The composition has been tested in the laboratory to determine whether it adversely affects aviation fuel with respect to the AVTUR FII standard. To date all results have shown that the preservative causes no significant changes. The preservative prevents growth of fungi or bacteria in the fuel or in a 10 v v water bottom containing 106 organisms per ml. It is expected, however, that there will be no significant water bottoms in practical situations due to the effort put in by the Fuel Companies to reduce the water content in aviation fuels to less than 30 ppm. Accordingly, these results indicate that under the severest of conditions, much more severe than those ever likely to be encountered, the biocide is effective. As a marine fuel preservative the composition can be employed at a use dilution for problem situations of from 0.1 to 0.28 v v. Tests to date show no adverse effects on the fuel, for example, no emulsions are formed.The preservative is effective in the presence of simulated sea water and has a similar spectrum of activity as in the aviation fuel situation. It is expected that as much as 108 water bottoms will collect in marine fuel situations and a preservative for use therein must be able to cope with such situations.As indicated above the present preservative prevents growth of fungi or bacteria in a 10 v v water bottom . Example 5 A marine fuel oil preservative composition was formulated by blending as follows Ingredients Percent bZ weightA mixture of propylated phenols 1.6Tertiary butyl hydroperoxide 100 16Carbendzazim, that is methyl 2 benzimidazole carbamate 1 0.01 ECS 2012 balance to 100 Examples 6 to 10 Each of the above Examples 1 to 5 was repeated except that the tertiary butyl hydroperoxide 100 was replaced by cumene hydroperoxide 100 to provide fuel oil preservative compositions especially suitable for marine fuel oils. Example 11 A marine fuel oil preservative composition was formulated by blending as follows Ingredients Percent by weightA mixture of propylated phenols 3Cumene hydroperoxide 1008 30Benomyl, that is methyl l butylcarbamoyl 2 benzimidazole carbamate 10.01 Kerosene Balance to 100 Similar compositions may be prepared using tertiary butyl hydrogen peroxide and or other phenolic biocides, as well as other fungicides,, such asCarbendazim, that is methyl 2 benzimidazole carbamate , and Thiabendazol, that is 2 4 thiazolyl lH benzimidazole at a level up to 0.1 by weight , with similar results. The synergistic effect exhibited by compositions in accordance with the invention containing tertiary butyl hydroperoxide TBHP was demonstrated as follows The Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations for TBHP, organic biocide alone and mixtures of TBHP plus biocide against a single test organism was determined in an aqueous medium. The test organism chosen wasPseudomonas aeruginosa since this has previously been shown to be one of the organisms most resistant to TBHP systems.To enable the test to be carried out in water it was necessary to emulsify the compounds using a detergent secondary alkyl sulphate The results obtained are set out in Table 1 below Table 1Compound Minimum Inhibitory ConcentrationComposition ppm of compound composition TBHP 100Dimethoxane 6 acetoxy 2, 4 dimethyl m dioxane 125Xylenols 125Propylated phenols 250 o Phenylphenol 125 o Cresol 156 1 1 w w mix of TBHP plus dime thoxane 62 2 1 mix with dimethoxane 23 5 1 mix with dimethoxane 18 10 1 mix with dimethoxane 17 1 1 w w mix of TBHP plus propylated phenols 31 2 1 mix with propylated phenols 23 5 1 mix with propylated phenols 18 10 1 mix with propylated phenols 17 1 1 w w mix of TBHP plus xylenols 75 2 1 mix with xylenols 75 10 1 mix with xylenols 55 20 1 mix with xylenols 55 1 1 w w mix of TBHP plus o cresol 100 2 1 mix with o cresol 75 Table 1 contd. Compound Minimum Inhibitory ConcentrationComposition ppm of compound composition4 5 1 mix with o cresol 62 10 1 mix with o cresol 44 1 1 w w mix of TBHP plus o phenylphenol 31 As can be seen from the above results, where a mixture of say TBHP and dimethoxane is used to inhibit the growth of Pseudomonas the expected concentrations of a 1 1 ratio mix would be 50 ppm TBHP plus 63 ppm dimethoxane. However, the actual concentrations were 31 ppm TBHP plus 31 ppm dimethoxane, which is a clear demonstration of synergism. Similar results are exhibited for the remaining mixtures. The above mixtures of 1 1 w w TBHP to biocide have been evaluated in Kerosene and Avtur Derv 2494 Fuel, giving protection against up to a 30 by weight inoculum of mixed culture at a use concentration of 0.3 by weight in the fuel oil. Other concentrations have been shown to give protection pro rata i.e. 0.1 by weight preservative composition protected against a 10 by weight inoculum of mixed culture. In addition, a fungicidal screening test was carried out to measure percentage inhibition of germination of Cladosporium resinae by a slide culture technique, as follows The compound or composition under test was dissolved in acetone 1 ml and diluted to 10 ml withDIESO fuel kerosene based solvent which had been sterilized by filtration. This solution was further diluted with sterilized DIESO 0.5 ml to 25 ml to give a stock preparation containing 100 ppm w v of said compound or composition, and 0.28 v v of acetone inDIESO. To prepare a spore suspension, 2.5 ml of a modified Bushnell and Hass medium, previously sterilised by autoclaving, was inoculated with one drop of a suspension of Cladosporium resinae spores to give 1 x 106 spores of Cladosporium resinae ml . Three 0.01 ml drops of this suspension were evenly distributed between the steel plates of specially adapted microscope slides, and a coverslip placed across the steel plates. TheDIESO solutions of the compound or composition under test were run in under the coverslips using a pasteur pipette approximately 0.33 ml , so that with the original total aqueous suspension of 0.03 ml, a 11 1 ratio of DIESO to water was obtained. The slides were placed in covered dishes and incubated at 300C for 48 hours. After incubation the slides were examined under a microscope for germination and growth of conidia ofCladosporium resinae at the DIESO water interface.Fungicidal activity in the test compound or composition wae shown by failure of the conidia to germinate, and the production of short bent or deformed germ tubes. In untreated controls, long branching vegetative hyphae and conidiophores of Cladosporium resinae were observed.Two counts were made from each drop, from which the gerRination was calculated. In the above slide test the following results wre obtained Tertiary butyl hydroperoxide at 100 ppm germination not prevented Bivgard DXN 2,4 dimethyl 6 acatoxy 1,3 dioxane at 100 ppm germination not prevented T iary butyl hydroperoxide vgard DN X in a 10 1 ratio at 18 ppm germination prevented In our co pending British Patent Application No. ssr3 34423 there is described and claimed a composition for use as a preservative or disinfectant, which composition comprises one or more organic biocides selected from phenols, aldehydes, heterocyclic compounds, quaternary ammonium compounds and cationic compounds, and at least one hydroperoxide of the formula EMI11.1 wherein R is an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon group, in particular as an aqueous emulsion or dispersion, preferably one including an surface active agent present in an amount of at least about 10 by weight of the composition. Also, that other invention in, a modification embraces a composition for use in preserving wood, which composition comprises at least one hydroperoxide of the formula I, at least one biocide and, optionally a non aqueous liquid carrier or solvent.
