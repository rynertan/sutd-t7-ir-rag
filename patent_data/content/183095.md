# Print hammer flight time control system.

## Abstract
A hammer timing control system for the print hammers of a line printer uses a plurality of read write RAMs 24 30 in place of individual fire control circuits for controlling the firing periods of the hammers. A delay value RAM 90 stores individual delay values to be interposed before each hammer is fired, and a terminate fire RAM or register 84 stores a delay to be interposed before the firing of a hammer is terminated. The hammers are turned on and turned off by signals incrementally clocked out from two pairs of RAMs which store each hammer address at memory locations corresponding to the hammer s assigned delay values.
