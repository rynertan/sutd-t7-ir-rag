# Method and apparatus for detecting failure of nuclear fuel.

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus for detecting failure of nuc lear fuel by means of a multi handle automatic shipper, which comprises a shipper capping operation of mounting a shipper cap 100 of the apparatus for detecting failure of nuclear fuel on the top part of fuel assemblies 1 , an isolation operation of supplying air into the cap after completion of shipper capping operation, thereby forming an air layer 157 , and isolating the fuel assemblies to be detected from other fuel assemblies, a soaking operation of keeping the fuel assemblies in the iso lated state for a predetermined period of time, a cell water removal operation of discharging water from system, and a sampling operation of introducing a predetermined amount of cooling water in the fuel assemblies to sample water recep tacle 361 , the operations being provided in sequence, and other operations being carried out in parallel with the aforementioned operations.
