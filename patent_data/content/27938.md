# Apparatus and method for holding and tacking material.

## Abstract
An apparatus 30 and method is provided for holding and tacking an elongate material 12 onto a body 14 , which body 14 may be toroidal in shape. The material 12 is applied to the body 14 by means of a shuttle 22 rotating about the body 14 in a plane transverse to a plane containing the body 14 . The apparatus 30 in cludes a tacker arm having a clamping means for clamp ing and unclamping the end of the material 12 , extending from the shuttle 22 , to the arm. The arm is pivotaliy mounted on a carriage for movement between a first posi tion, wherein the material 12 clamped to the arm is held against the body 14 , and a second position, spaced from the body 14 . In the first position of the arm, the body 14 will move the arm until the clamping means unclamps the material 12 whereupon the arm is pivoted to the sec ond position. The carriage is reciprocable for moving said arm between said second position, spaced from the body 14 , and a third position, remote from the shuttle 22 .
