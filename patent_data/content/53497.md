## Description
Solar assisted heating system This invention relates to a heating system assisted by solar energy. Rising fuel prices tend to make solar energy a more attractive proposition, but the cost of solar energy rises with the temperature at which it must be delivered. It is desirable therefore to employ a system where solar energy is collected at relatively low temperatures and a heat pump is used to deliver this energy at the required utilisation temperature. We have now devised such a system and according to this invention a heating system comprises a solar radiation collector capable of supplying heat to a low temperature heat of fusion heat store, means for delivering heat from the heat store to an evaporator, means for delivering vaporised adsorbate from the evaporator to an adsorber housing adsorbent, means for heating adsorbent and adsorbed adsorbate housed in the adsorber, means for delivering vaporised adsorbate from the adsorber to a condenser, means for delivering condensed adsorb ate from the condenser to the evaporator and means for obtaining heat from the adsorber and from the condenser and delivering it to the load. The solar radiation collector can take various forms and may for example comprise a simple unglazed black receiver in the form of a conduit through which a liquid, e.g. antifreeze ethylene glycol solution or salt solution, e.g. calcium chloride, is circulated. Usually the temperature of the liquid extracting heat from the solar radiation collector will be fairly low, e.g. from 50 to 150C. This heat has to be stored in a heat of fusion heat store and the most convenient method is by the use of encapsulated low melting point materials contained in a tank through which the liquid, e.g. antifreeze solution circulates. The heat of fusion heat store comprises a container in which there are one or more liquid tight heat conducting receptacles, for example plastic or elastomeric bags, each of which houses a substance with a relatively high latent heat of fusion i.e. above 120 kJ kg. These receptacles are preferably made of flexible material to cope with expansion and contraction of the substance housed therein. Suitable substances include benzene freezing point 5.50C, latent heat of fusion 126 kJ kg , formic acid freezing point 8.40C, latent heat of fusion 247 kJ kg , acrylic acid freezing point 130C, latent heat of fusion 155 kJ kg , paraxylene freezing point 160C, latent heat of fusion 164 kJ kg , and glycerol freezing point 180C, latent heat of fusion 199 kJ kg . Communicating with the heat store e.g. through a conduit is an evaporator for the adsorbate. This is a container provided with a heat exchanger from which heat from the heat store is delivered to the adsorbate housed in the evaporator. Preferably there are means for extending the surface of the liquid in the evaporator, e.g. a large area fabric wick or a pump for pumping the liquid through a spray into the evaporator. Communicating with the evaporator e.g. by a valved conduit, is an adsorber which houses adsorbent. There are also means for supplying heat to the adsorbent and adsorbate in the adsorber and this may be an eleetrical resistive heater, run for example by off peak electricity.However it is primarily intended that this means for supplying heat shall be by heat exchange from the hot heat transfer fluid in the pipes from a domestic boiler. These pipes should have a coiled section passing through the adsorber, surrounding which is adsorbent and adsorbate.Heat is usually supplied to the adsorbate and adsorbent at about 1500C. It is desirable that the adsorber should be able to be recharged at very low vapour pressures and consequently the preferred adsorbent adsorbate system is 5A zeolite molecular sieve water, more preferablyY zeolite molecular sieve water. However it would be possible to use an activated charcoal hydrogen iodide system. There are means for obtaining heat from the adsorber and this is preferably a heat exchanger. This may for example, be a pipework in which water circulates communicating with the load, having a coiled section which is surrounded by the adsorbent housed in the adsorber. There are means for delivering vaporised adsorbate from the adsorber to the condenser. This will usually be a conduit having a valve, and this valve will preferably be a non return valve, so that condensed adsorbate cannot pass back into the adsorber. This conduit is usually connected to the top of the condenser. In this condenser the adsorbate vapour is condensed and if the adsorbate is water it usually delivers latent heat at a temperature of about 600C. There are means for obtaining heat from the condenser. This is preferably by heat exchange, for example a pipework with a coiled section located in the condenser in which water circulates, the pipework communicating with the load. This pipework preferably connects with the means for obtaining heat from the adsorber, there being a valve to control whether heat is obtained from the adsorber or whether it is obtained from the condenser. It is highly desirable that there be heat exchange between condensed adsorbate leaving the condenser for delivery to the evaporator and the vaporised adsorbate leaving the evaporator before being adsorbed by adsorbent in the adsorber. Accordingly it is preferred that the means for communicating the evaporator with the adsorber be in heat exchange relationship with the means for communicating the condenser with the evaporator. The rate of adsorption can be increased by the use of a carrier gas, for example an inert gas such as nitrogen or even air. Accordingly as a preferred feature of this invention there are means for circulating carrier gas from the top of the adsorber to the condenser, from the condenser to the evaporator and from the evaporator to the adsorber. As it enters the top of the evaporator the carrier gas should preferably be delivered through a sparger below the level of adsorbate in the evaporator.One or more conduits and a gas circulating blower are the convenient form of means for circulating carrier gas and the conduit connecting the top of the adsorber with the condenser should have a non return valve therein preventing passage of adsorbate vapour from the condenser to the adsorber. In a preferred embodiment the liquid circulating in the boiler and connecting pipework which supplies heat to the adsorber has a boiling point preferably above 150 C and therefore has the advantage that heat can be supplied at higher temperatures than 1000C without the necessity of subjecting the circulating liquid to high pressures. Several commonly used heat transfer fluids may be used for this purpose, for example heat transfer oils, or inorganic substances such asSi2C16 which boils at 1390C. If Si2C16 is used then it may be under slight pressure to raise the boiling point to 1500C. Also one could use mineral oil based fluids capable of operating at temperatures upto 3150C without pressurisation, e.g. fluids used by Wanson Co Ltd, BorFam Wood L Herts in their thermopac thermal fluid heaters In accordance with this invention the system operates as follows.The solar radiation collector supplies heat to the latent heat of fusion heat store housing the substance of relatively high heat of fusion surrounded by a liquid such as antifreeze solution. Adsorbate is vaporised in the evaporator by circulated liquid, e.g. antifreeze and passes preferably in heat exchange relationship with condensed adsorbate from the condenser to the adsorber where it is adsorbed giving up heat of adsorption. Adsorbent is stripped from the adsorber by the means for heating adsorbent and adsorbate e.g. domestic boiler, and vaporised adsorb ate is condensed in the condenser giving up latent heat of condensation. Condensed adsorbate is returned preferably in heat exchange relationship with vaporised adsorbate from theEMI5.1 tb evaporat SEP r SEP tb to the evaporator whence it delivers sensible heat to the liquid, e.g. antifreeze solution and hence to the heat store. When the means for heating adsorbent is operating, latent heat is obtained from the condensation of adsorbate in the condenser. When the means for heating the adsorbent is not operating heat can be obtained as heat of adsorption from the adsorber, the solar radiation collector supplying heat to the heat store during daylight hours causing heat to be stored in the molten substance. When the molten substance freezes, latent heat of fusion is evolved supplying heat to the circulating liquid, e.g. antifreeze solution, and causing adsorbate vapour to be driven off to the adsorber from the adsorbate housed in the evaporator. A preferred form of heating system is now described with reference to the accompanying drawing. An array of solar panels diagrammatically indicated at 1 supplies heat to antifreeze solution at a maximum temperature of 180C. The antifreeze solution is circulated by pump 3 through a pipework 2 to a heat store 4. This heat store 4 contains several elastomeric bags 5, each containing benzene. These bags 5 are surrounded by antifreeze solution. Heat can be transferred from the heat store 4 to an evaporator 6 through a conduit 30 having a circulation pump 7 and connected to heat exchanger 8. The top of the evaporator 6 is connected by conduit 9 having valve 10 to the bottom of an adsorber 11. Part of conduit 9 forms one of the coils of heat exchanger 31. The adsorber 11 houses adsorbent 12 which is Y zeolite molecular sieve. Connected to the top of the adsorber 11 is a conduit 13 having a is non return valve 14 and a blower 15. This conduit 13 connected to the top of a condenser 16. There is a conduit 17 part of which forms one of the coils of heat exchanger 31 which connects the bottom of the condenser 16 with a sparger 18 which is immersed in adsorbate at the top of the evaporator 6. Heat transfer fluid from a domestic boiler 19 circulates in the pipework 20 having heat exchange coil 21 in the adsorber 11. This pipework 20 has a circulation pump 22. Pipework 23 connects two way valve 24, heat exchangers 25 and 26 in the condenser 16 and adsorber 11 and through this pipework 23 water circulates by means of pump 27 and leads to the load. When the boiler 19 is operating, the adsorber 11 is stripped of water vapour adsorbate which is condensed in the condenser 16 and delivers its latent heat to the water circulating by pump 27 in coil 25 and piping 23 at about 600C. From the condenser 16 the water passes through conduit 17 and heat exchanger 31 where it delivers heat, to the evaporator 6 where it delivers some more sensible heat and its temperature drops to the working temperature 5 150C, of the heat store 4. When the boiler is not operating it is possible to deliver heat from the heat store 4 to the load by switching valve 24 so that heat exchanger 26 in the adsorber 11 is incorporated in the load circuit piping 23. Under these conditions the benzene in the bags 5 freezes giving up its latent heat of fusion to the circulating antifreeze solution which supplies said heat to the evaporator 6, causing water vapour to pass from the evaporator 6 through conduit 9, receiving heat in the heat exchanger 31, to the adsorber 11 where it is adsorbed, giving up its heat of adsorption to the water circulating in coil 26 and hence to the load via piping 23. During the day the solar panels 1 are capable of delivering solar energy to the heat store 4 at temperatures in the range 5 150C. The carrier gas used is air and when heat is being delivered to the load either by stripping water vapour from the adsorber 11 or by adsorbing water vapour in the adsorber 11 valve 10 should be open and blower 15 operated. The air will be carried with water vapour from the top of the adsorber 11 to the condenser, through the sparger 18 and back to the adsorber 11. When heat is not being delivered valve 10 should be closed and blower 15 shut off.
