# ELECTRIC MOTORS

## Abstract
A submersible electric motor pump combination for use, say, in extracting hydrocarbons in off shore drilling installa tions has a stator formed of annular laminae of magnetically soft metal each individually encapsulated by a porcelain enamelling process. The rotor may be similarly formed or it may be of unitary construction and formed of magnetic stainless steel.
