# Circular knitting machine incorporating a stitch density adjuster device.

## Abstract
The subject of this invention is a circular knitting machine incorporating a stitch density adjuster device which comprises a slide 2 rigidly associated with a stitch cam 3 and being movable relatively to the cam assemblies of the needle cylinder 4 in a substantially parallel direction to the needle cylinder 4 axis. The device is peculiar in that it comprises a step motor 5 controlled by an electronic machine control 50 and connected to a drive cam 1 which engages rotatably with said slide 2 to impart to the stitch cam 3 a set displacement relatively to the needle cylinder 4 cam assemblies the slide is also movable relatively to said cam assemblies against and by the action of an elastic means.
