## Description
The present invention relates to a liquid crystal device using a liquid crystal having bistability with respect to an electric field hereinafter referred to as bistable liquid crystal , especially a ferroelectric liquid crystal, and more particularly to a liquid crystal device for time division driving of the memory driving type. Liquid crystal display devices for displaying a pattern or information have been well known in which a plurality of scanning electrodes and a plurality of signal electrodes are arranged in the form of a matrix and liquid crystals are interposed between the scanning and signal electrodes, whereby a plurality of picture elements are defined. In order to drive such liquid crystal display devices, a time division driving method is used in which an address signal is applied sequentially and periodically to the scanning electrodes and in synchronism with the address signal predetermined information signals are selectively applied to the signal electrodes in parallel. Such liquid crystal display devices and the methods for driving them have serious defects as will be described below. Thus, it is difficult to increase the density of picture elements or the size of a picture. Liquid crystals which have been used in practice in liquid crystal display device because of their fast response and their low electric power consumption are twisted nematic liquid crystals of the kind disclosed in, for instance, Voltage Dependent Optical Activity of a Twisted Nematic Liquid crystals , M. Schadt and W. Helfrich in Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 18, No. 4, Feb. 15, 1971 , pages 127 128. The liquid crystals of this kind assume a helical structure in which the molecules of a nematic liquid crystal having a positive dielectric anisotropy are twisted in the direction of the thickness of the liquid crystal layer and are arranged in parallel with each other between electrodes when it is not applied with an electric field. When an electric field is applied, the molecules of the nematic liquid crystal with a positive dielectric anisotropy are oriented or aligned in the direction of the electric field to cause optical modulation. In the case of a display device in which a liquid crystal of the kind described is used and which has a matrix of electrodes, a voltage higher than a threshold voltage required for arranging the molecules of the liquid crystal in the direction perpendicular to the surfaces of the electrodes is applied to a region selected point at which both a scanning electrode and a signal electrode are selected and no voltage is applied to a region non selected point at which neither of a scanning electrode and a signal electrode is selected. As a result, the molecules of the liquid crystal are maintained in a stable state in which they are in parallel with the surfaces of the electrodes. When linear polarizers are disposed upon the upper and lower surfaces of a liquid crystal cell or device of the type described in cross nicol relationship, a selected point prevents the transmission of light while a non selected point permits the transmission of light, whereby a display or picture device is formed. However, in the case of a liquid crystal device with a matrix of electrodes, a finite electric field is applied to a region the so called semi selected or half selected point in which a scanning electrode is selected while a signal electrode is not selected or in which a scanning electrode is not selected while a signal electrode is selected. When the difference between a voltage applied to a selected point and a voltage applied to a half selected point is sufficiently large and if a threshold voltage at which the molecules of a liquid crystal are oriented in the direction perpendicular to an electric field applied is between the above described voltages, the correct operation of a display element can be ensured. However, when the number N of scanning lines is increased, a time period duty ratio during which one selected point is subjected to an effective electric field during the time when one frame is scanned is decreased at a ratio of 1 N. As a consequence, in the case of repetitive scanning, the greater the number of scanning lines, the smaller the effective voltage difference between a selected point and a non selected point becomes. As a result, the problems of the reduction in contrast of a picture and of crosstalk are unavoidable. These essentially unavoidable problems result when a driving method that is, a repetitive scanning method in which a liquid crystal which is not bistable that is, a liquid crystal in which the molecules assume a stable state in which they are oriented in the horizontal direction relative to the surfaces of the electrodes and are oriented in the vertical direction only when an effective electric field is applied is driven by utilizing a time storage effect. In order to overcome these problems, there have been proposed a voltage averaging method, a two frequency driving, a multiple matrix method and so on. However, neither of them is satisfactory in solving the above described problems. Therefore, it is impossible at present to provide a display device with a large picture size and with a high density of picture elements because it is impossible to sufficiently increase the number of scanning lines. An object of the present invention is to provide a novel liquid crystal device for time division driving which has solved the problems involved in the conventional liquid crystal devices. More specifically it is concerned with improvements in a ferroelectric crystal display of the kind disclosed in European Patent Application EP A 0091661 in which two sets of electrodes form a matrix of electrodes defining a plurality of pixels containing a ferroelectric crystal material, the two sets of electrodes being electrically insulated from one another. According to the present invention a liquid crystal apparatus of the kind comprising How the invention may be carried out will now be described by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which In the liquid crystal apparatus a liquid crystal material is used which can assume As such bistable liquid crystals, chiral smectic liquid crystals having ferroelectricity are most preferred. Among them, liquid crystals in chiral smectic C phase SmC Specific examples of the ferroelectric liquid crystal compounds to be used in the present invention include those represented by the following formulas In the formulas, C accompanied with is an asymmetric carbon atom. When a device is constituted by using these materials, the device may be supported with a block of copper, etc., in which a heater is embedded in order to realize a temperature condition where the liquid crystal compounds assume a desired chiral smectic phase such as SmC Referring to Figure 1, there is schematically shown an example of a ferroelectric liquid crystal cell. Reference numerals 11 and 11a denote base plates glass plates on which a transparent electrode of, e.g., In₂O₃, SnO₂, ITO Indium Tin Oxide , etc., is disposed, respectively. A liquid crystal of an SmC When the above mentioned ferroelectric liquid crystal is used as an optical modulation element, it is possible to obtain two advantages. First is that the response speed is quite fast. Second is that the orientation of the liquid crystal shows bistability. The second advantage will be further explained, e.g., with reference to Figure 2. When the electric field E is applied to the liquid crystal molecules, they are oriented in the first stable state 23. This state is stably retained even if the electric field is removed. On the other hand, when the electric field Ea of which direction is opposite to that of the electric field E is applied thereto, the liquid crystal molecules are oriented to the second stable state 23a, whereby the directions of molecules are changed. Likewise, the latter state is stably retained even if the electric field is removed. Further, as long as the magnitude of the electric field E being applied is not above a certain threshold value, the liquid crystal molecules are placed in the respective orientation states. In order to effectively realize high response speed and bistability, it is preferable that the thickness of the cell is as thin as possible and generally 0.5 to 20 µ, particularly 2 µ or less. A liquid crystal electrooptical device having a matrix electrode structure in which the ferroelectric liquid crystal of this kind is used is proposed, e.g., in the specification of U.S. A 4367924 by Clark and Lagerwall. Next, an embodiment of method for driving a ferroelectric liquid crystal will be described with reference to Figures 3 to 5. Referring to Figure 3, there is schematically shown an example of a cell 31 having a matrix electrode arrangement in which a ferroelectric liquid crystal compound not shown is interposed between a pair of groups of electrodes oppositely spaced from each other. Reference numerals 32 and 33 denote a group of scanning electrodes and a group of signal electrodes, respectively. First, an instance of a scanning electrode S₁ being selected is explained. Referring to Figures 4A and 4B, there are respectively shown electric signals applied to a selected scanning electrode S₁ and electric signals applied to the other scanning electrodes non selected scanning electrodes S₂, S₃, S₄. On the other hand, Figures 4C and 4D show electric signals applied to the selected signal electrode I₁, I₃, I₅ and electric signals applied to the non selected signal electrodes I₂, I₄, respectively. In Figures 4A to 4D and 5A to 5D, the abscissa and the ordinate represent a time and a voltage, respectively. For instance, when displaying a motion picture, the group of scanning electrodes 32 are sequentially and periodically selected. If a threshold voltage for giving a first stable state of the liquid crystal having bistability is referred to as V On the other hand, the other scanning electrodes S₂ S₅ ... are grounded as shown in Figure 4B. Accordingly, the electric signals appearing thereon show zero volt. Further, an electric signal applied to the selected signal electrodes I₁, I₃, I₅ shows V as indicated in Figure 4C while an electric signal applied to the non selected signal electrodes I₂, I₄ shows V as indicated in Figure 7D. In this instance, the voltage V is set to a desired value which satisfies V₀ V On the other hand, as shown in Figures 5C and 5D, a voltage applied to all the picture elements on the non selected scanning lines is V₀ or V₀, each not exceeding the threshold level. Accordingly, the ferroelectric liquid crystal molecules electrically connected to the respective picture elements on the non selected scanning lines are placed in the orientations corresponding to signal states produced when they have been last scanned without change in orientation. Namely, when a certain scanning electrode is selected, signals corresponding to one line are written and thus writing of signals corresponding to one frame is completed. The signal state of each picture element can be maintained until the line is subsequently selected. Accordingly, even if the number of scanning lines increases, the duty ratio does not substantially change, resulting in no possibility of lowering in contrast, occurrence of crosstalk, etc. Referring to Figure 3, it is assumed that, among the picture elements formed at intersections of the scanning electrodes S₁ S₅ ... and the signal electrodes I₁ I₅, the picture elements with hatching are in the bright state and picture elements drawn in white are in the dark state. When display states on a signal electrode I₁ in Figure 9 are noted, a picture element A on a scanning electrode S₁ is in the bright state, and the other picture elements B are all in the dark state. By the way, with respect to a ferroelectric liquid crystal device placed under bistability condition as described above, the liquid crystal layer is formed in an extremely thin layer as thin as 2 µm or less and accordingly a short circuit can be caused between the opposite electrodes through fine particles disposed in the device. In order to obviate the short circuit, there is generally formed an insulating layer covering either one or both of the opposite electrodes, respectively. However, because of the insulating layer s formed on the opposite electrodes, when a writing pulse as shown in Figure 5B, which is expected to be sufficiently large to cause complete reversal of the ferroelectric liquid crystal, is applied to, e.g., a picture element B between the electrodes, a voltage having a waveform as shown in Figure 6 is actually applied to the liquid crystal layer. Thus, the actual voltage decreases in absolute value from 3V₀ by ΔV₀ in a proportion of π R₁ C₁ C₂ wherein R₁ resistivity of the liquid crystal layer, C₁ capacitance of a unit area of the liquid crystal layer, C₂ capacitance of a unit area of the dielectric layer , and the decreased voltage ΔV₀ is added to V₀ which is expected to be applied at the time of switching of pulses, i.e., at the beginning of phase t₂. This additional voltage can cause reversal of display state from that obtained by writing in phase t₁ first display state based on first orientation state of the ferroelectric liquid crystal to the reverse display state second display state based on second orientation state of the ferroelectric liquid crystal. The above fact has been clarified by our experiments. More specifically, in a line by line writing scheme as explained with reference to the fiqures 4A to 5D, a display state obtained in phase t₁ is required to be retained without reversal in phase t₂. Thus, a voltage exceeding a reversal or switching threshold voltage must not be applied in phase t₂. According to our study, however, it has been clarified that a voltage V₀ ΔV₀ exceeding the switching threshold voltage is applied in phase t₂ at the time of switching pulse polarities from phase t₁ to phase t₂ and a picture element expected to retain the first display state is reversed to the second display state, whereby a desired display cannot be attained. It has been also clarified that this phenomenon is caused by a reverse electric field ΔV₀ generated by discharge from the capacitor of the dielectric layer connected in series to the liquid crystal layer at the time of switching pulse polarities. On the other hand, it has also been recognized that a picture element which has been written in the first or second display state in phases t₁ and t₂ can reverse the display state even in a non scanning time period because information signals are continually applied from data lines. In order to obviate this problem, a method of applying alternating voltages not exceeding threshold values to the picture elements after writing has been conceived. A mode of operation according to this method is illustrated in Figure 9 wherein a writing signal and auxiliary signals of alternating voltages for preventing reversal phenomena, which are applied to a picture element A, are shown in time series by way of waveforms. However, application of such alternating voltages e.g., AC voltages also involve the problem as described above caused by the addition of a reverse electric field accompanying the application of reverse polarities of pulses as shown in the waveform at the bottom of Figure 9. Further, Figure 7 shows time serially applied waveforms by using unit pulse signal as shown in Figures 4A to 4D. Referring to Figure 7, according to an ideal operation, a voltage of 3V₀ exceeding the threshold voltage V Figure 8 is a graph plotting an application time dependency of a threshold voltage required for switching when DOBAMBC designated by reference numeral 82 in Figure 8 and HOBACPC designated by reference numeral 81 in Figure 8 were used as ferroelectric liquid crystal materials. In both cases, the thickness of the liquid crystal was 1.6 µ, and the temperature was controlled at 70 C. In this experiment, as base plates between which a liquid crystal was hermetically interposed, e.g., glass plates on which ITO was vapor deposited were used, and the threshold voltages V As seen from Figure 8, it is understood that the threshold voltage V Particularly, where an insulating layer is formed on an electrode, the effective voltage decreases with the lapse of time since the time of pulse application, the thus decreased voltage is added as a reverse polarity of voltage at the time of switching pulses. This phenomenon is illustrated at the bottom of Figure 7. Thus, in view of the waveform A in Figure 7, at voltage of 3V₀ is not applied in phase t₂ but a voltage decrease of ΔV₀ gradually occurs. When this writing signal is ceased to be applied, an additional voltage of V₀ is applied whereby the above mentioned reversal phenomenon is accelerated. As a result of our further study, based on the above observation, especially on the bistable liquid crystal constituting a liquid crystal device, it has been found possible to prevent the above mentioned reversal phenomenon and retain a once written signal state until the subsequent writing cycle when the volume resistivity of the ferroelectric liquid crystal is adjusted to 1x10⁹ Ω.cm or above, more specifically to a range of 1x10⁹ Ω.cm to 1x10¹³ Ω.cm, preferably 1x10¹⁰ Ω.cm to 1x10¹³ Ω.cm and particularly preferably to a range of 1x10¹¹ Ω.cm to 1x10¹³ Ω.cm. On the other hand, if the volume resistivity of the ferroelectric liquid crystal is below 1x10⁹ Ω.cm, the voltage decrease ΔV₀ amounts to approximately 3V₀ 3, whereby a reversal of display occurs during one frame period of writing operation as will be described in the examples appearing hereinafter. In order to obtain a ferroelectric liquid crystal having a volume resistivity of 1x10⁹ Ω.cm or above, it is conveniently adopted, for example, to add an adsorbent for ionic substances such as alumina particles, silica gel particles, etc. into a ferroelectric liquid crystal, vigorously stir the resultant mixture and separate the ionic adsorbent by filtration. The ionic adsorbent may preferably be in the form of particles having an average particle size of the order of 10 to 50 µm. The volume resistivity of a ferroelectric liquid crystal material described herein has been obtained through the dual frequency method by using a circuit as shown in Figure 10 to apply rectangular pulses and using the following equations to calculate σ volume resistivity . wherein V measured voltage, f frequency of the rectangular pulses, I For different frequencies, the following equations are used Finally, ρ is calculated by the following equation wherein d thickness of liquid crystal layer cell gap , and S electrode area. The insulating material constituting the above mentioned insulating layer used in the present invention are not particularly limited but may be appropriately be selected from inorganic insulating materials such as silicon nitride, silicon nitride containing hydrogen, silicon carbide, silicon carbide containing hydrogen, silicon oxide, boron nitride, boron nitride containing hydrogen, cerium oxide, aluminum oxide, zirconium oxide, titanium oxide and magnesium fluoride or organic insulating materials such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyimide, polyamide imide, polyester imide, polyparaxylylene, polyester, polycarbonate, polyvinylacetal, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetate, polyamide, polystyrene, cellulose resin, melamine resin, urea resin, acrylic resin and photoresist resins. The insulating film may suitably be formed in a thickness of 5000 Å or less, preferably 100 to 5000 Å, particularly preferably 500 to 3000 Å. The above mentioned reversal phenomenon may be prevented further more effectively by adjusting the capacitor of the insulating layer to 5.5 x 10³ pF cm² or above. The insulating layer preferably has a capacitor of 5.5 x 10³ 3.0 x 10⁵ pF cm², particularly preferably 9.0 x 10³ 5.5 x 10⁴ pF cm² in order to provide a sufficient insulating property. The present invention will be explained in further detail by way of actual examples of production. On two electrode plates with stripe form electrodes designed to cross each other to form opposite matrix electrodes, a 5 wt. solution of a polyamic acid resin combined product of pyromellitic anhydride and 4,4 diaminodiphenyl ether in N methylpyrrolidone was applied and heated to 250 C to cause ring closure reaction to form a 1000 Å thick polyimide film. The polyimide films on the two electrodes were respectively rubbed in one direction, and the electrode plates were fixed to each other so that their rubbed directions were in parallel with each other to form a cell. Then, 0.3 wt. part of alumina particles having an average particle size of 30 µ was added to 1 wt. part of DOBAMBC decyloxybenzylidene p amino 2 methyl butyl cinnamate prepared in Canon Kabushiki Kaisha., and the mixture was mechanically stirred for 2 hours at a temperature providing the isotropic phase of DOBAMBC. After the mechanical stirring, DOBAMBC was separated by filtration and injected by the vacuum injection method and sealed up in the above prepared cell while being in the isotropic phase. Then, the cell was gradually cooled at a rate of 5 C hour to form a liquid crystal cell of SmC A polarizer and an analyzer were disposed on both sides of the liquid crystal cell in a cross nicol relationship, and signals having waveforms as shown in Figures 4 and 5 were applied to the opposite matrix electrodes. The scanning signal was an alternating waveform of 8 volts and 8 volts as shown in Figure 4A, the writing signals were 4 volts and 4 volts, respectively, and the one frame period was 30 m.sec. As a result of the memory drive type time division driving operation as described hereinbefore under these conditions, this liquid crystal device provided a normal motion picture display without causing reversal of written states. On the other hand, as a comparative test, a liquid crystal device was prepared in the same manner as in the above except that the mechanical stirring of DOBAMBC in the presence of alumina particles was omitted. The volume resistivity of the liquid crystal in this device was measured in the same manner and found to be 1.2 x 10⁸ Ω.cm. When this liquid crystal device was driven in the same manner as described above, a once written display state was reversed during one frame operation whereby normal motion picture was not displayed. A liquid crystal device was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 except that the DOBAMBC used in Example 1 was replaced by HOBACPC hexyloxybenzylidene p amino 2 chloropropyl cinnamate prepared in Canon K.K. The volume resistivity of the liquid crystal cell was measured to be 1.6 x 10¹⁰ Ω.cm. After disposing a polarizer and an analyzer on the liquid crystal cell, the resultant liquid crystal was subjected to a time division driving as described above, whereby good motion picture was displayed likewise. A liquid crystal device was prepared in the same manner as in the above Example 2 except that the mechanical stirring of HOBACPC in the presence of alumina particles was omitted. The volume resistivity of the liquid crystal in this device was measured in the same manner and formed to be 5.2 x 10⁸ Ω.cm. When this liquid crystal device was driven in the same manner as described above, a once written display state was reversed during one frame operation whereby normal motion picture was not displayed. The DOBAMBC and HOBACPC were subjected to mechanical stirring for different periods of time in the presence of alumina particles or to addition of an ionic surfactant to obtain ferroelectric liquid crystals having volume resistivities as shown in the following Table 1. Liquid crystal devices were prepared by using these ferroelectric liquid crystals and subjected to time division driving in the same manner as in Example 1, whereby the results shown in Table 1 were obtained. The symbols used in Table 1 with respect to the display performance indicates the following. Thus, o shows that no reversal phenomenon was observed, x serious reversal phenomena observed, and Δ partial reversal phenomena observed.
