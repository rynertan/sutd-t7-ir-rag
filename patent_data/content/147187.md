# Cleaning apparatus for charge retentive surface.

## Abstract
Apparatus for removing residual charged particles from a charge retentive surface 10 in an electrophotographic printing machine comprising a particle removal roller 70 and a detoning roller, 72 the former of which is adapted to remove the residual particles from the charge retentive surface and the latter of which removes the particles transferred to the particle removal roll. The detoning roller comprises an array of conductive electrodes 80 83 extend ing about the circumference thereof such that when a multi phase power source is applied thereto a travelling electrostatic wave is generated which causes charged parti cles having a predetermined diameter and charge to be moved axially along the detoning roller towards one end thereof. The particles so moved represent toner devoid of paper debris and are thus suitable for reuse.
