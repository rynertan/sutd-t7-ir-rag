# Apparatus for recording and or reproducing signals on a magnetic tape.

## Abstract
An apparatus for recording and or reproducing signals on a magnetic tape is provided with two reel discs 97, 98 160, 161 , at least one magnetic head 17, 18 165, 166 which is arranged on a head slide 19 164, 194 , a pressure roller 137 180 arranged on a pivotable pressure roller arm 135 179 and which is movable against a capstan 96, 185 , a central drive wheel 83 157 which is rotatable in two directions and which, via normal mode and fast mode idler wheels 84, 169 and 91 159 respectively carries on pivotable arms, can drive the reel discs, and a pivotable switching lever 114, 176, 206 which is adapted to be coupled to the pressure roller arm, the fast mode idler arm and the normal mode idler arm and to brake arms 104, 105 171, 173 . Depending on the direction of rotation of the central drive wheel the fast mode idler arm is pivoted from an inoperative position into a first or second operative position respectively. In a first position control means which are adjustable to two positions limit the pivotal movement of the switching lever to movement into a first, partly pivoted operating position. in which first position of the control means the fast mode idler arm is uncoupled from the switching lever so that the fast mode idler arm is pivoted. In the second position of the control means the switching lever is pivotable into a fully pivoted second operating position, the fast mode idler arm then occupying the inoperative position through the coupling of the fastmode idler arm with the switching lever and the normal mode idler arm being pivoted into the operative position. In both operating positions the switching lever is also coupled to the head slide.
