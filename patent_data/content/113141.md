# A method for the removal of waste material in rotary punching.

## Abstract
In the rotary punching of a moving material web the punched out waste material has to be removed so as not to interfere with the course of the punching. This can be done with the help of vacuum and internal ducts in the female roll, but this method cannot be used at high working speeds because of the centrifugal force. Instead of this in accordance with the invention the die hole 5 of the female roll 2 is provided with pistons 7 forming a seal which are man oeuvred to and fro in rhythm with the rotaton of the roll. As a result the punching waste 6 is retained for only a short while after the punching and is elected thereafter and carried away via an external suction arrangement 14 .
