# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO HIGH PRESSURE SODIUM LAMPS

## Abstract
The invention provides an improved high pressure sodium lamp of nominally 70 watt rating operating at a lamp voltage V of substantially 70 130 volts in which for satisfactory life, efficacy and colour, for an arc tube of internal diameter d in the range 3.0 to 5.0mm, the sodium mole fraction x, in the range 0.63 0.8, and arc length ℓ are determined by interpolation or extrapolation on the graph of Figure 3 or by the equation ℓ 4d 11.76x 0.25 V 16.4
