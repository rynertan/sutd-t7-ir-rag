# Cylinder locks.

## Abstract
A cylinder lock includes two barrels 23, 37 , a first 23 carrying tumblers 30 that abut internal shoulders 36 of the lock casing 2 to obstruct clockwise unlocking rotation only, and the second 37 carrying a single tumbler 43 which obstructs only counter clockwise locking rotation by abutment with a shoulder 48 of a rear end casing over 8 . A key 5 inserted through a keyhole defining assembly 11, 16, 21 withdraws the first barrel tumblers 30 during initial clockwise turning from the insertion position, and the second barrel tumbler 43 during initial counter clockwise turning. Lost motion coupling between the barrels 23, 37 , provided by lug in 38, 39 interengagement, enables clock wise turning of the second barrel 23 during withdrawal of the first barrel tumblers 30 , and corresponding counter clockwse turning of the first barrel 23 relative to the second 37 during withdrawal of the second barrel tumbler 43 . Lug in slot coupling 22 24 between the keyhole defining assembly 11, 16, 21 and the first barrel 23 similarly allows initial slip for clockwise key turning. A coiled spring 42 opposed resiliently second barrel turning in both directions.
