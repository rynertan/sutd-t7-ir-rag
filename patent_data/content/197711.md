# NURSING AID

## Abstract
A Nursing aid comprises a garment having two armholes 4 and a neck opening 6 , a front 2 , and a back 3 , and the width of at least the front of the garment being such that the sides can be tucked beneath the patient. The front 2 of the garment, in use, can serve either as an overlay with respect to clothes covering the patient to prevent the patient gaining direct access to his or her torso, or as a means of limiting patient arm movement by wrapping the front of the garment around the patient s arms and then tucking the sides of the garment beneath the patient to secure in position.
