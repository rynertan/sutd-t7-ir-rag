# Method and apparatus for the detection of anomalies in electrically conducting rotating members.

## Abstract
A detector operable to detect cracks in a rotating member 60 generates an alternating eddy current in the rotating member with an external coil 68 surrounding the rotating member. A pick up coil 68 senses changes in the magnetic field of the eddy current due to a crack. The frequency of the excitation current is very much lower than the frequency of rotation of the rotating member and a plurality of samples are taken for each degree location. The output signal of the pick up coil is comprised of both the crack indicative component and a residual or induced magnetism component. The signal is processed so as to extract the desired crack indicative component. This arrange ment permits detection of cracks at greater depths than was possible with the conventional eddy current techniques.
