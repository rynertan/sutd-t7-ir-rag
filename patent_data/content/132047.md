# Hemodialysis access monitor.

## Abstract
A monitoring arrangement is provided for detecting for extreme pressure conditions in blood tubing lines of a hemod ialysis system. The arrangement includes a first pushbutton switch 4 and a pivoted lever arm 15 . A clamping means 9 is located at a first end of the lever arm 15 for clamping the blood tubing line against the first pushbutton switch 4 , and the other end 19 of the lever arm 15 opposes a second pushbutton switch 20 . Under low pressure conditions, the blood pressure in the tubing is no longer sufficient to hold the first pushbutton switch 4 closed. The switch 4 then opens to signal a low pressure condition. Under high pressure condi tions, the blood tubing pressure causes the lever arm 15 to pivot so that the far end 19 of the lever activates the second pushbutton switch 20 , which signals a high pressure condi tion.
