# Photographic material with a barrier layer comprising a chill gelable polymer and a method for coating it.

## Abstract
A photographic element having thereon a barrier layer comprising a chill gelable polymer comprising a 30 to 97 weight percent of polymerized N alkyl substituted acrylamide, b 3 to 25 weight percent of polymerized crosslinking monomer having at least two addition polymerizable groups per molecule and c the remainder of the copolymer if any being made up by one or more other polymerized monomers, with the proviso that said other monomers c comprise less than 5 weight percent of cationic monomers, less than 15 weight percent of free acid monomers, and less than 3 weight percent of metal or ammonium salts of acid monomers. The barrier layer is particularly useful as a process timing layer in color image transfer film units.
