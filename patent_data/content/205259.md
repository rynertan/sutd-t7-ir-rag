# Microspherical cured phenolic resin particles and process for production thereof.

## Abstract
A process for producing microspherical cured phenolic resin particles having a particle diameter of not more than about 100 Âµm, which comprises reacting a novolak resin, a phenol and an aldehyde in an aqueous medium in the pre sence of a basic catalyst and an emulsion stabilizer. Novel microspherical cured phenolic resin particles are produced by this process. The resin particles have excellent impact strength and mechanical properties, a sharp particle size dis tribution, and a low secondary agglomerate content, and be cause of these properties, are useful as an excellent modifier or filler for various plastics and rubbers.
