# Control device for successive rolling mill.

## Abstract
A rolling mill control device detects a dimension or dimensions of a product material between two mill stands 3, 4 , and forecasts a width variation value of the material at a downstream stand on the basis of rolling characteristics of the material, etc. The position of an upstream stand is then varied to reduce the forecast value to zero. Feedback control is also effected on the position of the upstream stand based upon the difference between a reference width and an actually measured value.
