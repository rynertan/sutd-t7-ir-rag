# Pulse transmitting radar apparatus.

## Abstract
In a radar system utilizing same, a segmented chirp waveform is built up by frequency hopping trains of simple chirp pulses. Each chirp pulse in a train is identical and is transmitted on one of a set of discrete carrier frequencies. The carrier frequencies are uniformly spaced in a predeter mined bandwidth and are used in linear sequence. After transmitting on the last carrier frequency, the entire pattern is repeated, starting again at the first carrier frequency. The returns from the individual pulses are digitized and stored and the history thereof is then assembled by a digi tal signal processor into a high resolution image.
