# A BASE TO MAINTAIN AN UPSTANDING ELEMENT

## Abstract
A base to maintain an element in an upstanding state, the base comprising a container formed of moulded plastics material and having mounted thereon or being arranged to be engaged by an element to be maintained upstanding above the base. The container has a lower part to stand on a floor or ground surface, and an upper covering wall forming at least one upwardly open recess or tray. The base has a shape enabling it to stand stably and to increase the stability or resistance to upset the base so as to maintain said element upstanding when the base is in use, the base can be ballasted by liquid, slurry, particulate or lumpy material introduced into the interior of the container through an access opening leading thereinto and or by ballast loaded into the tray.
