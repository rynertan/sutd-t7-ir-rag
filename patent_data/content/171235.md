# Coating compositions especially for wood substrates which are based on non aqueous dispersions of ethylacrylate copolymers of defined extensibility and gel content.

## Abstract
A coating composition which is especially suitable for producing decorative coatings upon wood substrates com prises, as at least 51 by weight of the film forming material present, a sterically stabilised dispersion in a volatile organic liquid of insoluble vinyl or acrylic polymer particles, the polymer having an extensibility of 50 2000 and being crosslinked to such an extent that it has a gel content of at least 35 by weight.
