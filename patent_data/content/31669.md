# Nozzle penetration arrangements for nuclear reactor pressure vessel closures.

## Abstract
A nozzle penetration arrangement for a nuclear reactor pressure vessel closure 1 includes a nozzle 6 of a material different than that of the closure 1 . The closure 1 is pro vided with an internal plating 5 of an austenitic material. The nozzle 6 is received in a through hole 2 having counter bores 3, 4 at its opposite ends. In order to avoid thermal stresses on the friction or tension coupling 15 between the nozzle 6 and the closure 1 , a compensating ring 8 is pro vided between a shoulder 9 of the nozzle 6 and a contact surface 7 of the closure 1 . The height h of the compensat ing ring 8 and its material are selected in such a way that the elongation resulting from heat expansion of the nozzle and the clo sure materials is compensated in the region of the distance 1 extending from the shoulder 9 to the friction or tension coup ling 15 . The material of the ring 8 and the height h can be selected in such a way that a predictable difference in stress is created in the area of the friction or tension coupling 15 upon heating.
