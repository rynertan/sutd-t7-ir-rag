## Description
METHOD FOR OBTAINING A PHOTOGRAPHIC COMPOSITION OF TWO IDENTICAL IMAGES IN ORTHOGONAL ARRANGEMENT AND DEVICE FOR CARRYING OUT THIS PROCEDURE This invention relates to a procedure for obtaining a photographic composition of two identical images in which the two images correspond to the same negative, i.e. they are identical but with the particular feature that one is placed orthogonally with regards to the other. Likewise the invention refers to a device for carrying out the said procedure. It is therefore a question of having the image in the negative appear twice on a sheet of light sensitive paper, at the expense of a particular negative and by means of the procedure in question, with one of the images being displaced 900 with respect to the other and laterally juxtaposed. For this, the procedure proposed by the invention is based on the use of two systems of objective, one of which is destined to the formation of the main image, and the other is destined for the formation of the secondary image1 which is displaced 900 with respect to the former. The first objective system is designed to transfer the negative image directly to the corresponding sector on tAe.,light sensitive paper, allowing the displacement lae, ally of the said image so as to obtain a perfect centring of this image, while the second objective systems from the same negative and with the collaboration of two reflecting assemblies, carries out the foreseen turn of the 900 for the secondary image. For this, it has been foreseen that the two reflecting assemblies should be at an angle of 1350, and each one should consist of two orthogonal reflecting elements. By means of this structuring of each reflecting assembly and the mentioned angle establishing between the two assemblies, the image is turned, parallel to its perfect centering in the corresponding sector on the light sensitive paper. The mentioned reflecting assemblies could be materialised in practice by means of mirrors, totally reflecting prisms, or any other type of elements which can establish the two optical tracks foreseen between the negative and the two sectors bf the light sensitive paper. In accordance with a further embodiment of the invention the two differentiated objective systems mentioned above can be located behind an element with 50 transmittance and reflectance, such as, for example, a semi metallized mirror or an image deviating cube, thus making the beam of light split to 50 in two independent trajectories, to which both assemblies similar to those mentioned above are coupled, so as to obtain the centering of the main image with one of them, and the secondary image, turned 900 with regards to the former and adjacent to it on the light sensitive paper, with the other. In accordance with another possible variant of the invention, the objective itself, corresponding to the secondary image system, can be located between the two reflecting assemblies, which are still at 1350 and consisting of two orthogonal reflecting elements. In the latter embodiment, the device for the invention is made up basically of a plate holder, which is complemented with the corresponding housing, on which supports are established for two objectives which receive the beam of light passing through the photograph negative independently. One of such objectives is destined to obtaining the main image, i.e. the image that will adopt the conventional positioning on the light sensitive paper, in accordance with the position of the negative, while the second objective a first pair of orthogonal mirrors collaborate, producing a double orthogonic deviation in the same direction for the beam of light, which is found with a second pair of orthogonal mirrors, in which two more orthogonic deviations opposite the first are produced, but with the particular feature that the first and second pairs of mirrors make an angle of 1350, so the final trajectory of the beam of light, still recouping the original direction, undergoes a turn in its position which gives rise to, in accordance with the pursued aim, the secondary image being displaced 900 with regards to the main image. The described structure is complemented with a series of adjustment and setting elements which allow the controlling of the position of the mirrors, in order to have the two resulting images correctly placed on the light sensitive paper. From the described structuring, it can be deduced that, obvously, depending on the angle formed by the two pairs of mirrors, whether this angle is positive or negative, a different positioning in the displacement of the secondary image with regards to the main image shall be obtained. So as to facilitate the correct centering of the two images on the light sensitive paper, and as a complement to the adjustment and setting means for the two pairs of mirrors mentioned above, the beam of light corresponding to the main objective shall be made to incide on a pair of parallel mirrors, with its specular surfaces put face to face, likewise fitted with adjustment and setting means, with which the beam of light corresponding to the main image is displaced laterally. Mention must also be made of the fact that the device can be varied by placing a semi metallized mirror, a prismatic image deviating device or any other suitable element. with 50 transmittance and reflectance in front of the objective systems. It is also pointed out that there is another possible modification on placing the actual objective of the secondary system which forms the image turned 900 between the two above described reflecting systems. The following is a description of some specific embodiments of the invention reference being made to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows the result of a photographic image of two identical images, obtained by means of applying the procedure of the invention, with the positioning of the two images being represented in this figure, and in figure 1 , various composition possibilities. Figure 2 is a diagram of the trajectory and orthogonic deviation of the beam of light from the negative to the light sensitive paper, with the interposition of the two objective systems and their corresponding auziliary reflecting assemblies. Figure 3 illustrates, also in diagram, a detail of the two reflecting assemblies with which the turn of the secondary image is obtained. the angle formed by the said reflecting assemblies can be observed in detail. Figure 4 shows a detail of the orthogonic deviation of the beam of light, when a semi metallized mirror with transmittance and reflectance to 50 is intercalated before the two objective systems. Figure 5 is a similar representation to that ofFigure 4, but in this case the orthogonic deviation of the beam of light is obtained by means of a prismatic image deviating cube. Figure 6 shows a perspective view of a device for obtaining a photographic composition of two identical images, realised in accordance with the procedure of this invention. Figure 7 represents another perspective of the same device, displaced with regards to the previous one, and which collaborates in the detection of the integrating elements of the same. figure 8 is a diagram, in front elevation, of the objective corresponding to the secondary image and the two pairs of mirrors assisting. Figure 9 illustrates a side view of the same assembly represented in the above figure. Figure 10 is a ground view of the same assembly, in which ther angle of 1350 formed by the two pairs of mirrors can be observed in detail. Figure 11 shows a section detail of any one of the mirrors which collaborate in the handling of the beam of light. From these figures, it can be seen that the procedure in question is specifically designed for obtaining, on the same light sensitive paper 1 , two images 2 and 3 , corresponding to the same motive, with image 2 being defined as the main image, while the secondary image 3 is displaced 900 with regards to the main image. This can be observed in detail in Figure 1, it being obvious that the secondary image 3 can be to the right or to the left of the main image 2 and that its displacement of 900 can also be made by means of a turn to the right or to the left of the image. Both images 2 3 can also be clearly marginal, as has been represented in the diagram, or else a perfect continuity can be established, without the essence of the invention being affected. In any case, the constant which is maintained is that the major side of the secondary image coincides with the minor side of the main image, as well as their dimensions being proportional, in accordance with the previously mentioned premise. So as to obtain the mentioned photographic compisition and in accordance with the procedure of the invention, one must start with only one negative 4 , which has the image to be repeated, through which, as is conventional, a beam of light 5 is passed, but with the particular feature that in the said beam of light 5 , the two objective systems 6 7 are disposed. These objective systems establish the respective independent, optical tracks for the image transported by the beam of light. The first system of objective 6 is that which is destined to obtaining the main image 2 on the light sensitive paper 1 and, for the purpose of centering the main image correctly on the corresponding sector of the paper. the placement of a reflecting assembly has been foreseen. This assembly consists of 2 parallel mirrors 8 9 with which the correct lateral displacement of the image is achieved for the perfect centering on the paper. Parallel to this, in the second optic track,that corresponding to the objective system 7 two reflecting assemblies 10 11 are placed, each of which is made up of two orthogonal mirrors, and with the concrete and specific feature that the mentioned reflecting assemblies 10 11 are at an angle of 1350 Angle A , as can be observed with detail in Figure 3. By means of this angle formed by the two reflecting assemblies 10 11 and the correct relative positioning between the same and with respect to objective 7 , a perfect centering of the secondary image 3 is obtained on the corresponding sector of the light sensitive paper, in which the image is turned 900 with respect to the main image 2 , due precisely to the angle of 1350 formed by the two reflecting assemblies 10 11 . Is is obvious that depending on whether the mentioned angle goes in one direction or another, the secondary image 3 shall also be turned 900 in one direction or another with respect to the main image 2 , and that depending on the positioning of the negative 4 , the secondary image can be to the right or to the left of the main image. As has been said before, in the procedure of the invention, the possibility of using a single objective system has been foreseen for this the possibility of using an element with 50 transmittance and reflectance, as for example, the semi metallised mirror 12 seen in figure 4, or the prismatic image deviating cube 13 inFigure 5 is essential.In any case, the single beam of light 14 reaches the semi metallised mirror 12 or the cube 13 , it splits into two beams, one of which 15 is used for obtaining the main image 2 , which can accede directly to the corresponding sector of the light sensitive paper or else be laterally displaced with the collaboration of the reflecting assembly 8 9 while the other beam 16 which is perpendicular, will with the collaboration of the reflecting assemblies 10 11 give rise to the secondary image turned 900 with regards to the main image. Obvously, and as can be seen in observing the figures, beam 15 corresponds to 50 of the main beam 14 which crosses element 12 13 while beam 16 corresponds to the 50 reflected. In any case, in accordance with the basic purpose of the invention, the composition is obtained from a single negative, on the same light sensitive paper, with the images being adjacent and one with its positioning displaced 900 with respect to the other. From Figures 6 to 11, it can be observed that the device for carrying out the procedure of this invention is based on a frame 17 on which the respective objectives 20 and 21 are placed by means of suitable support 18 and 19 . Objectives 20 is designed for obtaining the main image, and in this sense it can project the beam of light directly onto the light sensitive paper, in accordance with the representation in the diagrams ora pair of parallel mirrors, not represented, can collaborate with the objective, thus achieving, as has already been said, a lateral displacement of the image so as to obtain a perfect centering of the image on the corresponding sector of the paper. With regards to the second objective 21 , and corresponding to the secondary image, it is assisted by a first pair of mirrors 23 and 24 placed orthogonally and assembled on a common support 25 with which a second pair of mirrors 26 27 collaborate, likewise assembled orthogonally on support 28 . The first pair of mirrors 23 24 determines the orthogonal deviations and in the same direction as the beam of light, while the second pair of mirrors 26 27 determines two more orthogonal deviations opposite the first ones, so that the light beam, after inciding on these two pairs of mirrors, recoups the original direction appreciably. But moreover, the first pair of mirrors 23 24 forms an angle of 1350 with regards to the second pair of mirrors 26 27 which is perfectly visible in Figure 10, thus having the second image undergo, throughout its trajectory, a turn of 90 , adopting this relative displacement position finally with regards to the main image obtained through objective 20 . the mentioned mirrors, as can be seen in the detail of Figure 11, are constituted by means of a glass 29 to which a metal support 30 is adapted, thus defining the specular surface 31 . Independent or not of the existence of parallel mirrors complementary to the main objective 20 , for centering the corresponding image, mirrors 23, 24, 25 and 26 shall be assembles on their respective supports 25,28 through adjustment and setting means 32 which likewide allow the controlling of the final position of the secondary image on the light sensitive paper, so that the image is perfectly set and adapted to the main image or a margin is determined with respect to the main image. In any case, in accordance with the basic purpose of the invention, the obtaining of two images of a different amplitude but coinciding in contents is achieved on a sheet of light sensitive paper, with the secondary or minor image being adapted to the main image with its length coinciding with the width of the latter, as well as an evident proportionality of dimensions. This description need not be made any more extense for an export in the subject to understand the scope of the invention and the resulting advantages. The materials, form, size and placement of the elements are variable as long as this does not suppose an alteration in the essence of the invention. The terms in which the invention has been described must be taken in the widest sense, not as restricting. Having described the nature of the invention, and also the way to put it into practice, it must be stated that the above mentioned measures are susceptible to detail modifications as long as they do not alter the fundamental principle.
