# Refrigerant compressor discharge valve.

## Abstract
A discharge valve for a refrigerant compressor includes a leaf spring 10 for biasing a flexible valve plate 9 which opens and closes a refrigerant discharge port 8 . The leaf spring 10 has a centrally deformed portion 10c which engages an intermediate portion of the valve plate 9 . During the initial opening phase of the discharge port 8 , no spring force is applied to the free end 9a of the valve plate 9 to thereby reduce any opening delay and increase the efficiency of the compressor.
