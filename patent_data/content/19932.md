# Continuous power source with bi directional converter.

## Abstract
A power source provides continuous AC power by employing a bi directional converter 10 which interfaces a rechargable DC power storage device 30 with AC mains power and AC loads. The bi directional converter 10 includes a transformer 75 having first and second windings 72, 74 coupled in reverse polarity through dual switching means 52, 54 in parallel with one another. The switching means 52, 54 are coupled to a state controller 20 responsive to conditions at the AC mains terminal, the AC load terminal and the DC power terminal. There are two general operating conditions, an active condition wherein DC power is provided to the AC load, and a standby condition wherein power is recovered by the DC storage device 30 . In the standby condition, the converter 10 operates in a so called flyback mode to recover power and to direct it to the DC storage device 30 . In the active condition, the converter 10 is pulse width modulated according to a predetermined duty cycle to produce an AC sine wave output at the AC load terminals. Where the AC load includes reactive components, the converter 10 operates to recover unused power from the load and to transfer power back to the DC power source 30 whenever the polarity of the output voltage differs from the polarity of the output current.
