# Method and apparatus of processing continuously cast slabs.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus of processing a continuously cast slab to prevent the formation of surface cracks by applying plastic strains to the surface layer of the slab in which a process of solidification is taking place are disclosed. The method comprises pressing a projection against the slab surface under specified conditions prior to introducing the slab to a leveling stage.
