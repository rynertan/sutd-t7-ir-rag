# A pair of opposite zero degree posterior teeth for a lower and an upper denture.

## Abstract
Zero degree posterior teeth for a lower and an upper denture, wherein opposite posterior teeth interact at least substantially in line contact. The contour at the level of the active surface of the posterior teeth closely resembles the contour of natural posterior teeth. In each pair of opposite posterior teeth the lingual or palatal contour section 1 of one posterior tooth is provided with a line shaped masticatory rim 2,2 and the buccal contour section of this posterior tooth is provided with a masticatory plant 4,4 while the palatal or lingual contour section of the opposite posterior tooth is provided with a masticatory plane and the buccal contour section of this opposite posterior tooth is provided with a line shaped masticatory rim. The posterior teeth are provided with evacuation channels 7,7 in their active surface, which channels originate near the line contact between opposite posterior teeth, their depth gradually increasing towards their end at the contour.
