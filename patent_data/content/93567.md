# Voice prosthesis device.

## Abstract
A low pressure voice prosthesis device includes a cylindrical housing 12 having a proximal end 14 with strap elements 18 extending outwardly from the proximal end 14 , a distal end 16 and a port 26 operatively cooperating with a tracheostoma 21 in the neck of a patient. The cylindrical housing 12 further includes a one way valve structure 24 comprised of an annular sealing rim 30 in the housing 12 adjacent the distal end 16 and a valve membrane 28 hingedly mounted within the housing 12 to cooperate with the annular sealing rim 30 to provide the one way valve structure 24 . An annular collar 34 extends outwardly from the housing 12 and is positioned to abut against the esophagus tissue when the device 10 has been positioned within a fistula 20 connecting the esophagus 22 to the tracheostoma 21 . The valve membrane 28 is movable from a closed to an open position when air passes through the port 26 from the tracheostoma 21 to the esophagus 22 to produce alaryngeal speech and sounds in the patient.
