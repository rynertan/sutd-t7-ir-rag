# Ultrafine fiber entangled sheet and method of producing the same.

## Abstract
An entangled non woven fabric having a fiber structure which comprises a portion A in which ultrafine fiber bundles consisting of ultrafine fibers of a size of not greater than about 0.5 denier are entangled with one another and a portion B in which ultrafine fibers to fine bundles of ultrafine fibers branch from the ultrafine fiber bundles and are entangled with one an other, and in which portions A and B are nonuniformly dis tributed in the direction of fabric thickness. The product of this invention has high flexibility as well as good shape retention. The invention also relates to a grained sheet having on at least one of its surfaces a grain formed by a fiber structure composed of ultrafine fibers to fine bundles of ultrafine fibers and having a distance between the fiber entangling points of not greater than about 200 microns, and a resin in the gap por tions of the fiber structure. The grained sheet of the invention has high flexibility resistance, shearing fatigue resistance and scratch and scuff resistance.
