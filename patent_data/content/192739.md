## Description
This invention relates to a process and apparatus useful for effecting liquid liquid extraction. Processes which result in the mass transfer of one or more components contained in a first liquid medium having a given specific gravity, to a second substantially immiscible liquid medium having a different specific gravity by intimately contacting the liquids together are called liquid liquid extraction processes. Such extraction processes have been used for many years and may be carried out in a number of ways. Typically, the liquid solution to be treated is initially brought into intimate contact with a suitable substantially immiscible liquid which preferentially extracts one or more components from the solution. Since the liquids have different specific gravities, they are then allowed to separate from each other, for example, by gravity, and are recovered. The components that are extracted by such a process may be liquids, solids or ionic species, for example. In one application of such a liquid liquid extraction process, components which are soluble in organic solvents can be removed extracted from an aqueous solution by intimately contacting the aqueous with a suitable water immiscible organic extractant, followed by phase separation. Similarly, acidic or basic components of an organic solution can be removed by contacting the organic solution with an alkaline or acidic aqueous solution as appropriate. In yet another application of a liquid liquid extraction process, an aqueous solution containing an ionic species can be contacted with a liquid ion exchange material which forms all or part of an organic medium that is immiscible with the aqueous phase. Upon such contact, the ionic species combines with the ion exchange material ion exchanger to thereby form a compound that is soluble in the organic but insoluble in the aqueous. One example of a liquid ion exchanger is a hydroxy oxime exchanger which is useful to extract copper from acidic or basic aqueous solutions containing copper ions. Typical of such a hydroxy oxime ion exchanger is a product sold under the trademark LIX 64N by Henkel Corporation, Tucson, Arizona, The word LIX is a trademark registered in the United States by Henkel Corporation. The 64N is a grade designation. As is mentioned above, in liquid liquid extraction processes, two immiscible liquids are brought into intimate contact for the purpose of the mass transfer of one or more components from one liquid or phase to another liquid followed by physical separation of the two liquids. Any device or combination of devices which accomplishes such mixing and separation one time is called a stage. Since in each such stage, mixing of two immiscible liquids takes place and the resulting dispersion is allowed to settle out to thereby separate the phases, such devices or units are usually called mixer settlers. In many instances, a liquid liquid extraction plant includes a plurality of mixer settler units arranged in series. For example, such an extraction plant can include one or more mixer settler units that make up an extraction section in which a material is transferred from one liquid medium the feed into a second liquid medium the extractant as is described above. The plant can also include one or more mixer settler units in series with the extraction section to provide a stripping section . In the mixer settler units of the stripping section the pregnant extractant extract , i.e., the extractant containing the material transferred to it, is contacted with an immiscible liquid medium capable of removing the transferred material from the extractant. The regenerated extractant can then be recovered from the stripping section and recycled back to the extraction section. Additionally, the liquid containing the transferred material the raffinate can either be discarded or treated by various means to recover the transferred material. In one example of using a multi stage extraction plant for removing copper ion from an aqueous phase, there can be four mixer settler units in series. For example, two mixer settler units in series with each other can be used as an extraction section in which an organic medium, such as a mixture of kerosene and LIX 64N ion exchanger , is brought into intimate contact with an aqueous phase, preferably at a pH greater than about 2 and containing copper ion. In the extraction section, the copper ion is removed from the aqueous phase and transferred to the organic medium by means of the LIX 64N ion exchanger. Two mixer settler units can be arranged in series with the extraction units to provide a stripping section . In the stripping section a solution of sulfuric acid, preferably at a pH less than about 2, can be brought into intimate contact with the copper containing organic phase to thereby remove the copper from the organic as copper sulfate. The regenerated organic can then be returned to the first mixer settler unit of the extraction section as fresh organic to start the cycle over again and the copper can be recovered from the sulfuric acid solution, for example, by electrowinning. There are mixer settler units of a wide variety of designs presently known in the art. For example, U. S. Patent No. 3,989,467 discloses a unit which includes a mixing tank where liquids are mixed to form a dispersion which then flows into a settling tank located next to the mixing tank. The liquids flow horizontally across the settling tank and during this horizontal flow, three horizontally extending layers develop the upper and lower layers are formed by the coalesced phases as the liquids separate from the dispersion, while the middle layer, which is usually only a few inches in depth, is a dispersion of one of the liquids in the other. The separated phases are removed from the end of the settling tank remote from the mixing tank by means of suitably located weirs. Attempts to reduce the horizontal cross sectional area of such settling tanks for a given flow rate of dispersion can result in a disproportionate increase in the depth of the dispersion layer and accordingly, can result in flooding of the settler with dispersion. This results in carryover of one of the liquids in the other and inefficiencies in operation. The large size of conventional horizontal gravity settlers, such as the unit described above, requires that an undesirably large inventory of organic liquids be maintained in the settler. Additionally, such horizontal units can take up much more ground or floor space than is desired. U. S. Patent No. 4,221,658 addresses the problem of undesirably large organic inventories and horizontal cross sections associated with horizontal units by providing a generally vertical mixer settler unit where both mixing and settling are carried out in the same vessel. The mixing zone, where the immiscible liquids are mixed together to form a dispersion, is at the center of height of the vessel and the coalescing zones into which the immiscible liquids of the dispersion settle out are above and below the mixing zone. FR A 2093055 discloses a centrifugal process in which two liquids are mixed together for liquid liquid extraction and are then separated by centrifugation. Furthermore, said FR document discloses an apparatus for carrying out the centrifugal process. There remains a need in the art, however, for a vertical mixer settler unit with an improved design for enhancing the mass transfer and extraction as well as the complete separation of the immiscible liquids from the dispersion so that carryover is minimized. U.S. Patent No. 2,405,158 discloses a multiple contact countercurrent extract or adapted to carry out the solvent extraction of one material from a mixture thereof. Said extractor comprises a settling tank assembly wherein an outlet for a first liquid medium is near the top and an outlet for a second liquid medium is near the bottom. Further provided is an elongated extraction column as well as a diverter extending downwardly along a portion of said extraction column. Furthermore mixing means are provided for mixing the first and second liquid mediums together and for flowing the liquids through the apparatus toward the settling tank outlets. In accordance with this invention, a vertical mixer settler unit is provided that is useful for contacting a first liquid medium with a second substantially immiscible heavier liquid medium to effect extraction of a component contained in one of the liquid mediums by the other liquid medium. The mixer settler unit includes a settling tank having a top and a bottom, wherein an outlet for the first liquid medium is near the top and an outlet for the second liquid medium is near the bottom. An elongated extraction column extends generally vertically upwardly through the settling tank bottom with the top of the extraction column being open and below the top of the settling tank. A diverter having a closed top and an open bottom surrounds and extends downwardly along a top portion of the extraction column. An annulus is between the diverter and the portion of the extraction column that is surrounded by the diverter. Mixing and pumping means are provided in liquid communication with the extraction column for mixing the first and second liquid mediums together to thereby form a dispersion of droplets of one of the liquid mediums in the other liquid medium and for pumping the liquids through the unit toward the settling tank outlets. Means, in the settling tank, provide a sinuous flow path for the first liquid medium as it separates from the dispersion and rises towards the top of the tank. The dispersion flows from the mixing and pumping means upwardly through the extraction column and out its top. From the top of the extraction column the dispersion flows downwardly through the annulus beween the diverter and extraction column so that the dispersion exits the open bottom of the diverter into the settling tank. The first liquid medium separates from the dispersion, rises to the top of the settling tank and exits the settling tank from the outlet near the settling tank top. The second, relatively heavier liquid medium separates from the dispersion, sinks to the bottom of the settling tank and exits the settling tank from the outlet near the settling tank bottom. The method of the invention is defined in claim 10. These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will be more fully understood when considered with respect to the following detailed description, appended claims and accompanying drawings, wherein Referring to the accompanying drawings, and particularly to FIGS. 1 and 2, thereof, there is shown a preferred embodiment of a mixer settler unit 10 provided in accordance with this invention. The unit 10 can be used alone or it can be combined in series with other such units to effect liquid liquid extraction. Since the assembled mixer settler unit 10 of this invention is designed for use in a vertical configuration, for example, as is shown in FIG. 2, the position of the components of the unit relative to each other and the flow of liquids through the unit are described below as if the unit is vertical. While it should be understood that virtually any liquid liquid extraction operation can be carried out in the mixer settler unit 10 of this invention, the unit 10 is described below with regard to extraction of copper from an aqueous solution by contacting the aqueous solution with an organic medium comprising a mixture of LIX 64N and kerosene. The mixer settler unit 10 includes an elongated extraction column 12 open at its top and bottom ends 14 and 16, respectively. In the illustrated embodiment the extraction column 12 is cylindrical and when installed, its longitudinal axis is vertically arranged as is shown in FIG. 2. Referring to FIG. 3 in addition to FIGS. 1 and 2, a mixer unit or mixer 18 is attached at its outlet 20 to the bottom end 16, i. e., to the inlet of the extraction column 12. The mixer 18 includes an impeller assembly 22 rotatably mounted in a casing 24. The impeller assembly 22 is circular in horizontal cross section and includes a circular impeller disk 26 fixed to a vertical shaft 28. The shaft 28 can be rotated about its vertical axis to thereby rotate the impeller disk in a horizontal plane. Such shaft rotation is accomplished by means of a pulley 30 on the bottom of the shaft which, in the illustrated embodiment, is driven by an endless belt 32 shown only in FIG. 3 attached to a drive means such as an electric motor not shown . A plurality of blades 34 are radially spaced apart from each other on the bottom of the disk and radiate outwardly from the center of the disk to about its perimeter. In the illustrated embodiment, there are four blades 34 on the disk, but more or fewer blades can be used as desired. The blades 34 preferably all have the same shape and extend downwardly from the disk toward the bottom of the casing. It is preferred that each such blade is tapered so that it s bottom edge 36 is closer to the casing bottom 38 at the end 40 of the blade adjacent the center of the disk and is farther from the casing bottom at the end 42 of the blade remote from the center of the disk. The mixer includes a suction end 44 best seen in FIGS. 1 and 2 into which liquids to be mixed are introduced and a mixing chamber 46 best seen in FIGS. 2 and 3 which houses the impeller assembly. Liquids are intimately mixed together in the mixing chamber by the impeller assembly as it spins to thereby form a dispersion of droplets of one of the liquids in the other. As is described below in greater detail, the dispersion formed in the mixing chamber 46 is pumped by the mixer out from its outlet 20, up through the extraction column 12 and into a vertically arranged settling tank assembly 48 where the components of the dispersion are separated. The settling tank assembly 48 includes an elongated shell 50 which is closed at its bottom end 52 by means of a plate 54. In the illustrated embodiment, the shell 50 is cylindrical and the plate 54 is circular. The extraction column 12 extends vertically through the center of the circular plate 54 and upwardly along the vertical axis of the settling tank shell 50. The open top end 14 of the extraction column 12 is below the top end 56 of the shell. An elongated cylindrical diverter 58 is housed within the settling tank shell 50. The diverter 58 is a pipe which surrounds and extends downwardly along a top portion 12a of the extraction column 12. The diverter has a closed top 60 shown in FIG. 2 which is directly above the open top end 14 of the extraction column. In the illustrated embodiment, the diverter 58 surrounds about the top half of the extraction column 12. An open annular space or annulus 62 extends along the length of the diverter between the diverter and the portion 12a of the extraction column surrounded by the diverter. The diverter is open at its bottom end 64 which, in the illustrated embodiment, is at about the center of height of the settling tank assembly. Because the extraction column 12 and diverter 58 are within the settling tank assembly shell 50 and extend vertically along its longitudinal axis, the volume of the settling tank is defined by the annular space 66 formed between the vertical wall of the shell 50 and the diverter and extraction columns. The settling tank assembly 48 also includes a baffle assembly 68 mounted in the annular space 66, i. e., mounted in the settling tank. The baffle assembly 68, which is described below in greater detail, includes a plurality of flat disk shaped baffles 70 that are vertically spaced apart from each other on four elongated vertical supports 72 shown in FIG. 1 . Each of the baffles 70 has a hole 74 through its center with the holes in alignment with each other. The shape and size of the baffles relative to each other can best be understood by referring to FIG. 2 which shows the baffles in cross section. The baffle assembly is mounted in the settling tank with the extraction column 12 and diverter 32 extending vertically through the holes 74 in the disks. The top 56 of the settling tank assembly is closed by a circular plate 80 on which the diverter 58 is mounted. A pipe section 82 is connected between the top 60 of the diverter 58 and the circular plate 80. The pipe section 82 has a plurality of holes 84 through it. Each such hole 84 provides an outlet for flow of liquids from the top of the settling tank. In the illustrated embodiment a surge tank 86 closed but vented at its top by a circular lid or plate 88 is mounted on top of the settling tank assembly 48. The bottom of the surge tank is the plate 80 which has a hole 90 through its center aligned with the pipe section 82. Thus, the surge tank 86 is in liquid communication with the settling tank via the holes 84 in the pipe section 82 and the hole 90 in the plate 80. Lighter liquids that separate from the dispersion, rise to the top of the settling tank and flow into the surge tank, are removed therefrom through an outlet line 92. Heavier liquids that separate from the dispersion and sink to the bottom of the settling tank flow from the settling tank through an outlet line 94 near its bottom. The heavier liquids exiting the bottom of the tank flow through an overflow weir system not shown which maintains the liquid level in the settling tank. The components of mixer settling unit 10 can be of various materials such as plastics or reinforced plastics or various grades of steel or the like. Selection of materials of construction in some cases can depend on the nature of the liquid mediums to be processed in the unit. Additional features of the construction of the mixer settler 10 of this invention are described below with regard to its operation. As is mentioned above, the operation of the mixer settler unit 10 provided in accordance with this invention is described with regard to extraction of copper from an aqueous solution by contacting the aqueous solution with an organic medium comprising a mixture of LIX 64N and kerosene. To start the liquid liquid extraction operation, the aqueous medium containing copper ion and the organic medium, e.g., a solution of 20 by volume LIX 64N and 80 kerosene, are introduced into the suction end 44 of the mixer 18 through a pair of inlet lines 96 and 97, respectively. The organic and aqueous mediums are drawn from the inlets 96 and 97 through a cylindrical passage 98 shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 and into the mixing chamber 46 where they are mixed together by the action of the impeller assembly to form a dispersion of one of the liquids in the other. In one working embodiment the feed rate of both the organic and aqueous mediums into the unit was 0.064 m³ min 17 gallons per minute and the tip speed of the impeller was about 305 m min 1,000 feet per minute . The rotation of the impeller causes a centrifugal force to be exerted on the aqueous and organic mediums as they are being mixed so that the liquids are forced out from the center of the impeller toward the casing side walls 24a and then out from the casing outlet 20 into the extraction column 12. Having both the inlet to the mixing chamber 46 and the outlet 20 at the center of the mixer leaves no stagnant regions and results in the formation of a dispersion of enhanced uniformity. As the liquids are forced toward the casing walls at least a portion of such liquids travel along the bottom surfaces 36 of the blades 34. Additionally, during mixer operation vortices are formed in the corners 46a of the mixing chamber. By providing the blades 34 designed as described above with tapered bottom edges and by having a circular impeller in a square casing so that some mixing of liquids is done in the vortices, the formation of a dispersion having desired properties is enhanced. For example, such a desired dispersion has a sufficiently small droplet size so that a desired degree of contact is made between the liquids to effect liquid liquid extraction while at the same time the dispersion droplets are not so small that separation of the phases from the dispersion is more difficult than desired. The mixer 18 provided in accordance with this invention provides a sufficient pumping head so that the dispersion formed in the mixer is also pumped by the mixer 18 through the remaining components of the mixer settler unit 10. The dispersion exits the mixer 18 through the outlet 20 and is pumped upwardly through the extraction column 12 and out from its top end 14. A packing material, for example rachig rings not shown , is preferably in the extraction column to aid in maintaining the liquids in a dispersed state as they pass through the column. This prolongs the time that the liquids remain in intimate contact with each other so that a desired degree of extraction is completed. The dispersion flows downwardly from the top 14 of the extraction column through the annular space 62 and out from the open bottom 64 of the diverter into the settling tank. As was mentioned above, the purpose of the settling tank assembly 48 is to provide for separation of the aqueous phase from the organic phase once the desired extraction has been completed e. g., in this case, once the copper has been transferred from the aqueous medium to the mixture of kerosene and LIX 64N . In the illustrated embodiment the organic copper containing mixture of kerosene and LIX 64N the organic medium separates from the dispersion and rises to the top of the settling tank. The organic medium exits the settling tank via the holes 84 in the pipe 82 and enters the surge tank 86. The aqueous which is now essentially free of copper separates from the dispersion and settles or sinks to the bottom of the settling tank where it exits via the bottom outlet 94. In addition to the unique design of the mixer assembly which results in a dispersion of desirable particle size, another key feature of the mixer settler unit 10 of this invention is the provision in the settling tank of sinuous flow paths which are traversed by the liquid mediums as they separate from the dispersion. For example, the sinuous flow path shown by the arrows 100 is traversed by the organic medium as it separates from the dispersion and rises toward the top of the settling tank. The sinuous flow path shown by the arrows 102 is traversed by the aqueous medium as it separates from the dispersion and sinks toward the bottom of the settling tank. The sinuous flow paths for both the organic and aqueous mediums are defined by the baffle assembly 68. The assembly 68 is preferably made up of two baffle sections an upper baffle section 104 comprising a plurality of vertically spaced apart baffles 70a located in the top half of the settling tank and a lower baffle section 106 comprising a plurality of vertically spaced apart baffles 70b located in the bottom half of the settling tank. It is preferred that the upper baffle section 104 is located entirely above the dispersion inlet the diverter outlet 64 and the lower baffle section 106 is located entirely below the dispersion inlet. The baffles 70a of the upper baffle section 104 define the sinuous flow path for the relatively lighter organic medium and the baffles 70b of the lower baffle section 106 define the sinuous flow path for the aqueous medium. Thus, the baffles 70a provide means for repeatedly substantially reversing the horizontal direction of flow of the organic as it rises toward the top of the settling tank and the baffles 70b provide means for repeatedly substantially reversing the direction of flow of the aqueous as it sinks toward the bottom of the settling tank. In the illustrated embodiment the shape of the sinuous flow path for the lighter organic medium is the same as the shape of the sinuous flow path for the heavier aqueous medium. As can best be seen in FIG. 2, the shape and spacing of the baffles that comprise both the upper and lower baffle sections 104 and 106, respectively, are sufficient so that the sinuous flow paths for both the organic and the aqueous require the liquids to turn through relatively smaller angles near the open bottom 64 of the diverter and to turn through progressively larger angles as the respective flow paths approach the top 56 and bottom 52 of the settling tank. The angle through which a liquid must turn when following a sinuous flow path defines the degree of severity of the flow path. Thus, as defined herein, a portion of a flow path is relatively less severe where the liquid following the path turns through a relatively smaller angle and a portion of such a flow path is relatively more severe when the liquid following the path turns through a relatively larger angle. By providing sinuous flow paths for both the organic and aqueous mediums that are less severe near the open bottom 64 of the diverter and become progressively more severe as the flow paths approach the top and bottom of the settling tank, surprisingly, the separation of the phases from the dispersion is enhanced and carryover of one of the liquid mediums in the other is minimized. The baffle assembly 68 preferably has a diameter of a size sufficient to provide a space 108 between the outside edges of the baffles 70 and the inside wall of the settling tank assembly shell 50. Thus, aqueous medium, after it separates from the organic medium rising toward the top of the tank can flow downwardly toward the dispersion layer shown as 110 for purposes of exposition herein in the space 108. Likewise, organic medium, after it separates from the aqueous medium sinking toward the bottom of the tank, can flow upwardly toward the dispersion layer 110 in the space 108. Providing the space 108 for flow of separated liquids enhances the maintenance of such separation and minimizes carryover. Another feature of the mixer settler unit 10 of this invention is that, due to the unique shape and spacing of the baffles, the velocity of the liquid mediums as they traverse their respective sinuous flow paths is alternately increased and decreased, i.e., the liquids are pulsed. This is accomplished by providing a baffle assembly having a design where the space between adjacent baffles or the space between a baffle and an adjacent vertical wall acts as a venturi. Thus, as the liquid medium passes through such a relatively smaller venturi, it speeds up and, as it exits the venturi into a relatively larger space, it slows down. This increase and decrease in velocity is repeated as the liquids travel along their respective sinuous paths. Such pulsing of the liquid velocity enhances the coalescing and separation of the liquids from each other and thus tends to minimize carryover. Due to the design of the mixer settler 10 of this invention, the lighter liquid, by the time it reaches the surge tank, comprises the organic medium in the substantial absence of the aqueous phase while the heavier liquid, by the time it reaches the bottom of the settling tank, comprises the aqueous phase in the substantial absence of the organic medium. In the illustrated embodiment the liquid liquid extraction apparatus or mixer settler unit 10 is a single stage. It is, of course, readily possible to adapt the teachings of this invention for multi stage liquid liquid extraction. For example, a plurality of single stage mixer settler units 10 can be connected for counter current or co current flow as is known in the art to provide a multi stage extraction plant. The above description of a preferred embodiment of a mixer settler unit 10 provided in accordance with this invention is for illustrative purposes. Because of variations which will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the particular embodiment described hereinabove. The scope of the invention is defined in the following claims.
