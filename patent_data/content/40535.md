# Method of forming a microscopic pattern, and a photoresist.

## Abstract
A film of a photoresist having phenolic hydroxyl groups is irradiated with far ultraviolet radiation, and is thereafter developed with an alkaline aqueous solution. Using the resist pattern thus obtained as a mask, dry etching is carried out to form a microscopic pattern. The photoresist of this composi tion is highly immune against dry etching, so that the micros copic pattern can be formed at a high precision. By adding an azide of a specified structure, the photoresist has its sensitiv ity to the far ultraviolet radiation greatly enhenced, allowing shorter exposure times.
