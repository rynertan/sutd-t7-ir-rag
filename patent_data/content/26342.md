# Lubricant composition for vinyl chloride resins, vinyl chloride resins containing such a composition and method of heat processing a vinyl chloride resin.

## Abstract
A lubricant composition useful as a heat processing aid for vinyl chloride resin compositions is disclosed. The lubric ant composition comprises a mixture of about 5 to 95 by weight of an ethylene polymer wax having an average molecular weight in the range of about 1,000 to 10,000, about 5 to 20 by weight of a waxy oxygen containing ethylene polymer having an acid number in the range of about 10 to 150, and about 0 to 90 by weight of a paraffin wax. The lubricant composition is most effective when blended with the vinyl chloride resin composition at levels within the range of about 0.5 to 3.0 parts per 100 parts resin.
