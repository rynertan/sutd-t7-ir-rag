The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel eluting with chloroform methanol 4 1 . Product containing fractions were pooled and the solvent removed. The residue was taken up in water and passed through C₁₈ Sep pak cartridges to afford N² hexanoyl 9 4 hydroxy 3 hydroxymethylbut 1 yl guanine 50mg, 14 , m.p. 86 88 A solution of 2 amino 6 chloro 9 2 2,2 dimethyl 1,3 dioxan 5 yl ethyl purine 0.25g, 0.8mmol in isopropanol 2.5ml containing sodium isopropoxide 0.5 To a solution of phenol 113mg, 1.2mmol in dry dioxan 2.5ml was added sodium hydride 60 dispersion in oil 48mg, 1.2mmol . After evolution of hydrogen ceased, 2 amino 6 chloro 9 2 2,2 dimethyl 1,3 dioxan 5 yl ethyl purine 0.25g, 0.8mmol was added and the mixture was stirred at 75 Vero Arican Green Monkey Kidney cells were grown to confluence in 24 well multidishes, each well being 1.6cm in diameter. The cells were infected with Herpes simplex type 1 virus HFEM strain and overlaid with 0.5ml of 0.9 agarose w v in maintenance medium. The test compound, prepared in maintenance medium in concentrations ranging from 100 to 0.3 µg ml in half log dilution steps, was added in 0.5ml volume. The virus infected cultures were then incubated at 37 MRC 5 cells were infected in suspension with Herpes simplex type 1 virus, strain SC16. The infected cell suspension was dispensed 0.1ml in 96 well microtitre plates containing the test drugs in maintenance medium in concentrations ranging from 100 to 0.03 µg ml in half log dilution steps 0.1ml per well . The plates were then icubated at 37 Compounds were also tested against Herpes simplex type 2 virus MS strain in Vero cells using Method 1 and in MRC 5 cells using Method 2. In the latter test, the incubation time was reduced to 24 hours. Compounds were administered by oral gavage 0.2mmoles kg in 0.1ml of 1 carboxymethyl cellulose to 20g female Balb C mice which had been starved for 18 hours. Fifteen minutes later, blood was collected from three mice by cardiac puncture using heparinised syringes. Equal aliquots were pooled and an equal volume of 16 trichloroacetic acid added. Following centrifugation 8,500g to remove precipitated proteins, the resulting mixture was analysed by high performance liquid chromatography using a C₁₈ Nova Pak cartridge eluted with Buffer A 50mM NaH₂PO₄, pH4.6 and Buffer B 10 Buffer A, 10 water, 80 methanol in a gradient from 1 to 95 Buffer B. 9 4 Hydroxy 3 hydroxymethylbut 1 yl guanine was assayed with a Pye Unicam PU4021 u.v. detector set at 254nm.
