# Tape cassette.

## Abstract
A tape cassette for use with a video tape recorder has con ventional tape guiding and braking elements within its housing, including a pair of spaced guide pins 20, 22 and 21, 23 for the tape 4 adjacent each reel and a resilient strip 25 that acts on the tape between the spaced guide pins and normally tends to deflect the tape from a straight path between the spaced guide pins for braking the tape when the cassette is not in use. A drag member 28, 29 is provided that contacts the tape when it is deflected to provide a tortuous path for the tape and thereby increase the resistance to tape movement.
