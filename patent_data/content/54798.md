# Positioning unit for radiation tomography apparatus.

## Abstract
A positioning unit for a radiation tomography apparatus characterized in a light beam detector 34 and a light beam generator 32 which are disposed opposite each other on a horizontal line L passing through the centre of a photographing region irradiated by X rays, a table top 36 on which a patient P is laid, a driving device 38 for driving the table top 36 in the vertical direction, a position detector 40 for supplying a signal the magnitude of which corresponds to the position of the table top 36 and a controller 44 which obtains data corresponding to the distance from an upper surface of a part of the patient P to the horizontal line L of the photographing region, based on an output signal of the light beam detector 34 and an output signal of the position detector 40 . In accordance with the distance data and data corresponding to the horizontal line L , the controller 44 energizes the driving device 38 until a signal correspond ing to the desired distance data is supplied by the position detector 40 .
