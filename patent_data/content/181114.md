# Gob distributor for a glassware manufacturing machine.

## Abstract
The gob distributor is for a glassware manufacturing machine of the individual section type. A gob delivering scoop 30 is turned about a vertical axis to align it with gob delivering guides 51 to 58 so that gobs of molten glass can be delivered to the sections of the machine in a predetermined sequence. The scoop 30 is turned by a fluid pressure operated motor 80,82 . The motor is controlled by a servo system 100 which operates a valve 90 which controls the supply of fluid under pressure to the fluid pressure operated motor.
