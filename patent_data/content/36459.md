## Description
TRACER CONTROL APPARATUS This invention relates to tracer control apparatus. In a tracer control apparatus in which the direction and velocity of tracing are calculated through utilization of signals from a tracer head tracing the model surface, it is a general practice to use different reference deflection or displacement values for the tracer head for rough and finish machining operations so as to reduce overall machining time and to provide for enhanced accuracy in machining operations. Previously, however, since the alteration of the reference deflection has been carried out by voltage applying means using a potentiometer or by mechanical means, and a manual operation has been needed for each alteration, which has made it difficult to perform machining operations continuously from rough to finish machining. According to the present invention there is provided tracer control apparatus, characterised by a memory holding data determining tracer machining operations to be effected, including reference deflection data designating an initial reference deflection signal value for comparison in a first tracing operation, with a composite displacement signal derived from displacement signals from the tracer head of tracer machining apparatus with which the control apparatus is employed, and data determining successive further reference deflection signal values for successive further tracer machining operations, and a processor operable to read out the data held in the memory, and in dependence upon the read out data, to apply control signals to the tracer machining apparatus such as to cause the machining apparatus to effect initial and successive tracer machining operations in accordance with the stored reference deflection data. Embodiments of the present invention can provide tracer control apparatus which automatically modifies the reference deflection of the tracer head for each machining operation to thereby permit continuous tracing from rough to finish machining. Embodiments of the present invention can provide tracer control apparatus in which data concerning the reference deflection of the tracer head is prestored in a memory and, based on the stored data, the reference deflection is automatically modified to permit continuous machining operations from rough to finish machining without a break, thereby reducing machining time. Briefly stated, in a traceicontrol apparatus embodying the present invention, data concerning the deflection of the tracer head is prestored in a memory and read out therefrom by a processor to alter the deflection for each profile modelling operation a comparison is made between a composite displacement signal, derived from displacement signals from the tracer head, and a reference deflection signal to obtain from the comparison a difference signal and tracer control is carried out in accordance with the difference signal.

These signals VN and VT are applied to the distribution circuit DC to yield a velocity command signal in accordance with the direct ion of displacement signals sin and cos 0 , and the velocity command signal thus obtained is supplied to the analog gate circuit GC.The velocity command signal is then delivered to that one of the amplifiers DRVX, DRVY and DRVZ which is selected by the analog gate circuit GC. By the velocity command signal, the servo motor corresponding to the selected amplifier is driven to feed the cutter CT and the tracer headTR in ganged relation to each other. The operations described above are already well known in the art. In the present embodiment of this invention, tracing operation data including data on the reference displacement or deflection signal tO is entered from a source such as keyboard KB for example for storage in the memory MEM, from which the data is read out as tracing operations proceed, and in accordance with the read out data, deflection and tracing path are controlled in the course of machining. That is, the present embodiment permits continuous machining operations from rough to finish machining by automatically changing the reference displacement or deflection for each machining operation in accordance with he stored data concerning reference deflection, without involving such manual operations as have been needed previously for changing reference deflection. As input data, use can be made of such data, as shown in the following tables, for example.

In Fig. 2, tracing turning positions LP andLN see Table 1 are X1 and X2 the pick feed value P is AO6 the tracing end position LTE is Y1 the automatic return position LRp is 21 the reference deflection an initial value AO2 is 0 and the stylus ST is controlled in dependence upon the data on the velocity and direction of tracing and so on so that it approaches a point a from a starting point A and traces the model surface following a route a b c ...u v and then automatically returns from the tracing end position Y1 to the automatic return position Z1. In this case, the tracing operation is controlled in accordance with a flowchart such as is depicted in Fig. 3. Upon depression of an approach button not shown , the processor CPU reads out data concerning the axis, direction and velocity of approach from the memory MEM and provides a signal via the data output unit DO to the analog gate circuit GC to activate the amplifier DRVZ in the case of tracer control in accordance with Fig. 2 , causing the servo motor MZ to lower the tracer head TR and the cutter CT. The velocity in this case can be determined by data supplied via the data output unit DO to the D A converter DA2. Before the stylus ST is brought into contact with the model MDL, the displacement signals Exç yss and are z arezero, and accordingly the difference signal is equal to the reference deflection signal When the composite displacement signal has become equal to the reference deflection signal tO as a result of contact between the stylus ST and the model MDL, the comparator COMP detects t 0, and applies an approach end signal AE to the data input unit DI. The approach end signal AE is read by the processor CPU to detect the completion of approach, and then tracing is started. Upon commencement of tracing, the processor CPU reads out data concerning the mode, the reference deflection, the direction of tracing and the feedrate, to start tracer control. The reference deflection data is converted by the D A converter DA1 into an analog reference deflection signal t O for input to the adderADD, and the servo motor MX is driven in a direction in accordance with the direction of tracing data. Further, the processor CPU reads out the tracing turning positions Lp and LN from the memory MEM and compares them with the content of the reversible counter CNTX representing the current position of the stylus ST. For example, tracing in a minus direction , when the content of the reversible counter CNTX and the tracing turning position LN match each other, the feed axis is changed over and the processor CPU reads out data such as the direction, velocity and quantity of pick feed P to control pick feed. When the content of the reversible counter CNTY comes to be equal to the pick feed quantity P in the course of the pick feed operation, the processor CPU causes the stylus ST to turn again, that is, controls it to trace in the plus direction .Further, the processor CPU checks whether or not the stylus ST has reached the tracing end position, and if it detects that the tracing end position LTE has been reached during the pick feed operation, the processorCPU reads out the data relating to whether or not the automatic return is ON, automatic return velocityVAR and automatic return position LRp, from the memory MEM.Assuming the automatic return is ON, the servo motorMZ is driven and when the content of the reversible counter CNTZ reaches the automatic return position hp, one tracer control operation has been completed. In the event that repetitive tracing has been preset by the input from the keyboard KB, for example, the processor CPU returns the stylus ST by ordinary positioning control to the approach starting point A immediately following the automatic return operation, to carry out tracing once again. In this repeat tracing , the reference deflection is set at 0 0 which is the sum of the reference deflection value the initial value O and the deflection value an increase or decrease value ss tO both read out by the processor CPU and added together.Since the repetitive tracing can be effected by automatically changing the reference deflection for each working operation as described above by cumulative modification , it is possible to achieve machining operations continuously from rough to finish machining, thereby to reduce machining time. It is alternatively possible to prestore reference deflections O1 to On relating to respective successive tracing operations Ol to On in the memory MEM and to read them out one by one instead of cumulatively adding 0 to 0 for each tracing operation. Further, by prestoring increase or decrease values for pick feed and tracer head feed rate in the memory, pick feed and tracer head feed rate can also be altered automatically for example in response to a change in the reference deflection, enabling more appropriate tracer control to be effected for rough and finish machining operations. The tracing turning positions Lp and LN, the tracing end position LTE, the automatic return position LRP end position LTE, the automatic return position LRP and the pick feed quantity P may alternatively be obtained by writing in the memory MEM the contents of the reversible counters obtained when the stylus ST is shifted to those respective positions in a manual feed mode, instead of entering the data from the keyboard KB. Also, during tracing operations, reference deflection and the tracing path can be corrected by reloading the data in the memory MEM. For example, the data in the memory MEM can be read out therefrom and displayed on the display DSP and the data reloaded by manipulation of the keyboard KB thus, the reference deflection and so forth can be corrected with ease. In the apparatus described above, all data defining tracing operations are prestored in a memory for controlling the tracing operation, but in other embodiments of the present invention, all the data need not always be prestored for example, the tracing turning position and the like may also be controlled by means of a limit switch. As has been described above, apparatus embodying the present invention permits repetitive tracing by changing the reference deflection by a predetermined value automatically for each successive machining, in accordance with prestored data concerning the deflection, and consequently automatic machining operations can be carried out continuously from rough to finish machining, resulting in the entire working time being greatly reduced. It will be apparent that many modifications and variations may be effected without departing from the scope of the novel concepts of the present invention. Thus, apparatus embodying the present invention can effect tracer control by calculating the direction and velocity of tracing using signals from a tracer head tracing the model surface, and the apparatus is provided with an input unit for entering data defining the tracing operation, a memory for storing the entered data and a processor for readingout the data from the memory to control respective parts of a tracer control machine. Of the data defining the tracing operation, stored in the memory, data concerning the reference displacement gO for the tracer head is read out by the processor to change the reference displacement for successive profile modelling operations, thereby providing for automatic performance of repetitive tracing.
