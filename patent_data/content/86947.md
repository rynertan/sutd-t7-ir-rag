## Abstract
Flame retardant thermoplastic molding compositions are described which comprise a polyphenylene ether resin, an impact modifier, a flame retardant plasticizer and, in addition, a low molecular weight hydrocarbon resin. The inclusion of the low molecular weight hydrocarbon results in better melt flow properties without detriment to other desired properties. As an additional unexpected benefit, the compositions exhibit improved impact strength.

## Description
PPE COMPOSITION CONTAINING IMPACT MODIFIER, FLAME RETARDANT PLASTICIZER AND MELT VISCOSITY REDUCER BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The polyphenylene ether resins are a well known family of linear thermoplastic engineering resins. A wide variety of these resins and a number of methods for their preparation are disclosed in Hay, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,306,874 and 3,306,875, as well as in Stamatoff, U.S. Patent Nos.3,257,357 and 3,257,358. The polyphenylene ether resins are admixable with other polymers as defined by Cizek, U.S. 3,383,435, and with thermoplastic elastomers conventionally used as auxiliary or modifying resins. These are employed to improve the impact resistance of articles molded from the mixtures, compositions of this type are disclosed in Cizek, mentioned above, as well as in Cooper et al, U.S. PatentNos. 3,974,235 4,101,504 4,101,505 and 4,172,929, and elsewhere. Many of these compositions are normally flarmnable. The term normally flammable as used herein is intended to mean not meeting the V O and V l requirements of the Underwriters Laboratories Bulletin No. 94 test. It is known that certain agents, e.g., aromatic phosphates, be added to impart flame retardancy self extinguishing behaviour and to also function as plasticizers for the composition. The resulting compositions often exhibit a mnbination of high heat distortion temperature the temperature at which a molded sample begins to deform , good resistance to breakage or fracture upon impact, and good fire resistance. There have, however, been some difficulties encountered in processing because of the high viscosity of the resins in the molten state. The high melt viscosity lowers the rate at which the resins can be molded in injection molding machines and increases the power required to maintain a given rate of production from extrusion machines. Higher processing temperatures can be used, but this can cause depolymerization, oxidation or other degradation of the resin. It has been proposed that the addition of low molecu lar weight hydrocarbon resins to certain polyphenylene ether resin blends can enhance processing by reducing the molding temperature and melt viscosity. Compositions of this type are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,189,411 to Haaf, and U.K. Patent No. 1,344,729. INTRODUCTION TO THE INVENTION It has now been discovered that the inclusion of certain low molecular weight hydrocarbon resins in flame retardant, plasticized blends of polyphenylene ether resin and an impact modifier provides better processability during molding and better surface appaarance, e.g., gloss, after molding. This is accomplished, moreover, without detracting from other important properties such as the heat distortion temperature and the flame retardancy. In addition, the presence of the low molecular weight resin results in an increase in the notched Izod impact strength, which is also unexpected. Preferably, the low molecular weight hydrocarbon resin is selected from among coumarone indene resins, cyclopentadiene styrene resins, aromatic petroleum resins, cyclopentadiene indene resins, phenol coumaroneindene resins and alpha methyl styrene resins. Commercially available forms are illustrated in the examples. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The polyphenylene oxide resins useful in accordance with the present kinds of compositions are, as previously indicated, individually well known. There are, however, various preferred composition components. These are primarily ones commonly having applications for which high impact strength is particularly desirable. The preferred polyphenylene ethers are homoand copolymers of the formula EMI4.1 wherein Q, Ql, Q and O , are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydrocarbon radicals, halohydrocarbon radicals having at least two carbon atoms between the halogen atom and the phenol nucleus, hydrocarbonoxy radicals and halohydrocarbonoxy radicals having at least two carbon atoms between the halogen atoms and the phenol nucleus, and Q , 0 and Q in addition may be halogen with the proviso that Q and Q are preferably free of a tertiary carbon atom and n represents the total number of monomer residues and is an integer of at least 50. Especially preferred is poly 2,6 dimethyl l,4 phenylene ether. The polyphenylene ether can be prepared by following the procedure described in the above mentioned patents. The polyphenylene ether resin is preferably in admixture with one or more polymeric impact modifiers.The impact modifier can be a styrene homopolymer in admixture or otherwise modified with an elastomeric material such as a natural or synthetic rubber, or a styrene containing elastomeric copolymer or terpolymer. By way of illustration, the impact modifier may be a homopolymer such as polystyrene, polychlorostyrene, poly alpha methyl styrene , or poly paramethyl styrene which has been modified by natural or synthetic rubber, for example, polybutadiene, polyisoprene, butyl rubber, EPDM rubber, natural rubber, polysulfide rubbers, polyurethane rubbers, etc., elastomeric styrene copolymers such as styrene butadiene copolymers, styrene acrylonitrile butadiene terpolymers ABS , block copolymers of styrene and a diene in their various forms, for example, A B, A B A, A B AB, A B A B A, etc., random or radial teleblock copolymers of these same materials, as well as hydrogenated forms of the linear, random or radial copolymers in which the aliphatic unsaturation, e.g., of the B diene block has been reduced and admixtures of any of the above mentioned styrene homopolymers with any of the above mentioned elastomeric styrene co and terpolymers. Blends of the polyphenylene ether resin and impact modifier can contain these materials in virtually any desired proportion, e.g., from 20 1 to 1 2 parts by weight. Only a small amount of the low molecular weight hydrocarbon is necessary to achieve the benefits of the invention. Amounts of at least about 0.1 percent by weight, and generally from about 1.0 to 5.0 percent by weight, based on the total weight of resins, are typical. It should be understoood, however, that the amount of this ingredient can vary widely both within and without this range, depending on particular requirements. The compositions also contain a flame retardanti plasticizer, preferably in amounts between 5 and 20 parts by weight of the resinous components. In the frost preferred embodiments, this material is selected from among aromatic phosphates, such as those having the formula EMI6.1 where R1 R2 and R3 can be the same or different and are alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkyl substituted aryl, halogen substituted aryl, aryl substituted alkyl, halogen, hydrogen and combinations of any of the foregoing, provided that at least one of Rl, R2 and R3 is aryl. Especially preferred is triphenylphosphate. The molding compositions of the invention can and advantageously do contain one or more of the supplaxmSzy non resinous agents which have heretofore been customarily present in polyphenylene ether resin molding compositions to improve certain other physical and chemical properties of the moldings. The agents include UV stabilizers, antioxidants, strengthening fibers for example, glass fibers and graphite whiskers , mineral fillers, dyes, and pigments. Many of such agents are disclosed in U.S. Patent No.4,172,929 to Cooper, et al. The supplementary non resinous agents are present in total amount of between about 1 and 50 , on a weight basis, so as to provide the benefits which these materials have conferred in the past on shaped molded articles made from thermoplastic resins. The molding compositions of the invention can be prepared by admixing the components together, as in a blender, to form a free flowing composition which is of suitable particle size for use as a direct feed to molding machines. Alternatively, the components can be formed into a homogenous melt, preferably under a blanket of inert gas, and then into solid particles of desired size from the melt, either by the extrusion, cooling and chopping method, or by solidifying the melt in any convenient way and grinding the resulting product to the desired particle size. Processing of the melt is considerably enhanced by the lower melt viscosity which is characteristic of the present compositions. The invention is further illustrated by the following examples. These are best embodiments of the invention and are not to be construed as limiting.Parts are by weight unless stated otherwise.
