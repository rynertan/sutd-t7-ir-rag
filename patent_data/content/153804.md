# Devices for inspecting inner surfaces of tubular objects.

## Abstract
A probe 10 for inspecting the inner surface of a tube 40 utilises a group of large diameter optical fibres 12 as a light source and an annular ring 14 of smaller diameter optical fibres as interceptors of the reflected light. A pair of plano convex lenses 16 focuses a light beam 42 emanat ing from the group of large diameter optical fibres 12 onto a reflective ball bearing 18 or a concave cone 32 causing a circumferential band 44 to be illuminated on the inner surface of the tube 40 . Light from the band 44 is intercepted by the optical fibres within the annular ring 14 and is transmitted therethrough. The transfer of light from the band 44 to the annular ring 14 can be optimised by bevelling the end of the optical fibres 14 within the annular ring.
