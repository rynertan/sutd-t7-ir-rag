# Polyester of 6 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid, aromatic diol and 1,4 cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid capable of undergoing melt processing.

## Abstract
A novel polyester is provided which has been found to exhibit an optically anisotropic melt phase which enables it readily to undergo melt processing to form quality fibres, films, moulded articles, etc. The polyester of the present invention contains recurring 6 oxy 2 naphthoyl moieties in addition to moieties derived from at least one aromatic diol and trans 1,4 cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid in the propor tions indicated. The hydrogen atoms present upon the rings of these moieties optionally may be at least partially substituted as described . The polyester is capable of forming the desired anisotropic melt at a temperature below approximately 350 C., and in a particularly preferred embodi ment at a temperature below approximately 320 C.
