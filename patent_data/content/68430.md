# Method of and apparatus for manufacturing a continuous slide fastener stringer chain with element free space portions.

## Abstract
A method of and apparatus 20 for manufacturing a continuous slide fastener stringer chain 11 including space portions 16 devoid of coupling elements at longitudinal intervals. A pair of continuous stringer tapes 12, 13 is continuously fed, in synchronism with a sewing machine 21 , to a sewing area 23 of the sewing machine, while a pair of interengaged rows of coupling elements 14 is intermittently fed, in synchronism with the sewing machine, to the sewing area. A lenght of coupling elements 14 is cut off from the pair of interengaged rows of continuous cou pling elements 14 each time the latter stops moving.
