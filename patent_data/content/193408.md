## Description
REACTIVE DUCT SILENCERS The present invention relates to reactive duct silencers adapted for use in reducing machine generated or other noise transmitted by gases passing through ducts in which the silencers are formed from a novel arrangement of resonators. It is known to provide silencers for use in ducts conveying gases in order to suppress or attenuate undesirable sound frequencies. Such silencers are usually of the absorptive type and are formed from porous material. However, it has been found that such silencers have a very limited life when used in harsh environments for example a situation in which the ducts convey hot gas streams with a significant particulate and or liquid burden. In this case, the particulate matter tends to block the pores of the absorptive material thereby causing a reduction in performance. In order to overcome this problem, the absorptive material has been wrapped in impervious material to prevent clogging. However, since the impervious material must of necessity be thin, its durability is uncertain.In particular when the gas temperature inside the impervious wrapping changes it may be accompanied by a static pressure change of sufficient magnitude to split the impervious material or collapse the porous material. Other methods have been used to overcome these difficulties including removing the absorptive material from the gas stream to form a tuned dissipative silencer and using perforated plates in conjunction with absorptive material. None of the abovementioned methods have been found to be completely satisfactory when used in gas streams containing significant particulate burdens. Furthermore all of the methods require sophisticated chamber shapes which are costly to produce, may suffer from metal fatigue and have a tendency to produce regenerated noise and high pressure losses with flow past the silencer elements due to the complex shapes requiredAdditionally attenuation is difficult to achieve at frequencies below 250 Hz. The present invention seeks to provide a silencer that is able to achieve performance for a satisfactory period of time under conditions in which hot gas streams having significant particulate burdens are conveyed through ducts. This is achieved through the use of a resonator of the Helmholtz type, in which the resonator comprises an arrangement of walls defining an acoustic cavity and an opening in a first wall, the opening givinq entry to a passage extending into the resonator the said passage being defined by the inner surface of a second wall which wall is spaced apart from the first wall by the openinq and an inner wall which is substantially parallel to the second wall and connected to the first wall at the opening, the resonator being arranged so that the direction of flow of the gas is parallel to the plane of the first wall. In British Patent Application l,594,382 Hoch et al there is disclosed a sound attentuation apparatus in which a plurality of resonators are provided for use in reaction engines such as gas turbines, wherein the resonators are positioned against the wall of a gas carrying duct. The resonators are of the Helmholtz type and are of a similar configuration to that described above. It is to be noted, as would be expected, from its intended use, the entry or throat for each of the resonators lie flush with the inner surface thereof, which surface carries the gas flow. In US Patent 4,231,447 Chapman , there is further disclosed an arrangement of Helmholtz resonators, generally of the aforementioned type, in which the entry into each of the resonator compartments is by a neck, the end of which has been biased in a manner such that the end lies in a plane extending at an acute anqle with the body of the neck. The invention claims that the advantaqe of such an arrangement is that it broadens the frequency response of the resonators. Again, as in the aforementioned disclosure, the entry to each of the resonator compartments lie on the same surface along which the gas flows. A further arrangement of Helmholtz resonators generally of the aforementioned type is disclosed inGB2,024,380 Chapman . The resonators disclosed therein are formed into an acoustic lining which may be used in the intake or exhaust ducts of gas turbine aeroengines.As in GB1,594,382, the entry to each of the resonator compartments lie on the same surface along which the gas flows. The present invention consists in a splitter adapted for use in a duct conveying a gas, comprisinq a plurality of resonators in side by side array, the array defining two, substantially parallel faces, each resonator comprising an array of walls defining an acoustic cavity, the only aperture in each acoustic cavity lying in the plane of a first of the walls and extendinq alonq substantially the full length thereof, the aperture being formed between an edge of the first wall and an edge of a second of the walls, which second wall lies in a plane which is transverse to the plane of the first wall, the aperture communicating with a passage extending into the cavity and being bounded on one side by the second wall and on an opposite side by an internal baffle, which baffle lies substantially parallel to the second wall and is connected to the first wall along the said edqe thereof bounding the aperture, the said first walls of the resonators forming the said faces of the splitters. As used in this specification, a splitter means an arrangement of connected resonators which function to divide the gas flow, whereby individual resonators are combined in such a way that the overall performance of the combination is substantially the sum of the performance of the individual resonators. The advantage of such an arrangement of resonators in a splitter is that it may be placed within a duct in a manner such that gas is permitted to flow over apertures lying in both faces, thereby producing an increased deqree of attenuation at the natural frequency of each of the resonators. It is also possible that the dimensions of each of the resonators may be varied in order to provide attenuation at two different frequencies. It is preferred that resonators according to the invention are formed by bending sheet steel, the qauqe of which is chosen so that the walls remain substantially rigid during operation. However, other materials and methods may be used to form the resonators provided that the resonators are sufficiently rigid and durable in operation. To achieve a suitable degree of attenuation and to produce resonance at the desired frequencies the dimensions of the resonators may be varied. By varying the length of the baffle of a resonator, the resonant frequency will be varied. The dimension of the aperture may also be varied decreasing the width of the aperture lowering the resonant frequency. Preferably the width of the aperture is not less than about 10 mm. However, the minimum dimension will be largely determined by the properties and the quantity of the particles present in the gas stream. In the majority of situations the dimension lies between 20 and 30 mm. The depth of the resonator defined by the lenqth of the second wall may also be varied. Preferably, the length of the second wall is between 50 and 500 mm. In a particularly preferred embodiment the lenqth is 250 mm. The width of the resonator defined by the length of the first wall may also be varied. Preferably the width of the resonator is between 50 and 500 mm. In a particularly preferred embodiment it is 100 mm. In any particular use situations, the dimensions of the resonators may be selected to maximize performance.In one embodiment, it has been found advantageous to provide at least one intermediate wall which effectively.divides each cavity in a splitter into two or more resonators. This intermediate wall extends longitudinally within the splitter, orthoganol to and connected with the first and second walls in a manner such that the lenqth, as defined by the dimension along the axis of a cavity transverse to the longitudinal axis of the splitter, is less than half the wavelength of the resonant frequency of the resonators. Although it is well known that Helmholtz resonators.are capable of resonating at a plurality of frequencies, the degree of attenuation obtained at the frequencies other than primary frequency is usually not siqnificant.The prevent inventor has found that the dimensions of a resonator of the invention may be appropriately selected to provide significant attenuation at least at two frequencies, wherein the degree of attenuation at least at the second frequency is lower than that of the primary frequency. This is of considerable benefit in that a separate set of cavities having resonance at the secondary frequency would not be required. In order to achieve resonance at a secondary frequency, at the appropriate attenuation, the dimensions of a cavity are firstly selected to give the desired attenuation at the primary frequency. The width of the first wall is then increased until resonance is achieved at the secondary frequency. However, because increasing the first wall width also has the effect of lowerinq the primary resonant frequency, it is necessary to vary other dimensions such as the width of the apperture and or the width of the second wall to shift the primary resonant frequency to that desired. Further adjustment to the width of the first wall may then be required toqether with adjustments to the other dimensions until the desired attenuation at the two frequencies is obtained. The resonators used to form the splitter may all be of the same dimensions in which case the degree of attenuation achieved at a specific frequency would be increased. Alternatively, the dimensions of the individual resonators may be varied as hereinbefore described in a manner such that the splitter will produce a degree of attenuation over a range of frequencies. In a second aspect, the present invention consists in an improvement to a duct adapted to convey a gas capable of carrying noise, the improvement comprising positioning within the duct at least one splitter, said splitter comprising a plurality of resonators in side by side array, the array defining two, substantially parallel faces, each resonator comprising an array of walls defining an acoustic cavity, the only aperture in each acoustic cavity lying in the plane of a first of the walls and extending along substantially the full length thereof, the aperture being formed between an edge of the first wall and an edge of a second of the walls, which second wall lies in a plane which is transverse to the plane of the first wall, the aperture communicating with a passaqe extending into the cavity and being bounded on one side by the second wall and on an opposite side by an internal baffle, which baffle lies substantially parallel to the second wall and is connected to the first wall alonq the.said edge thereof boundinq the aperture, the said first walls of the resonators forming the said faces of the splitters and wherein the gas flows in a direction substantially parallel to said splitter faces. It will of course be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that a plurality of splitters of the present invention may be used to form a silencer for use in a duct conveying a gas. In this embodiment of the invention, it is preferred that a number of splitters are formed into a silencer so as to produce the overall desired attenuation at the required frequencies. By properly selecting the dimensions of the individual resonators and cavities in a splitter, quite broad band attenuation may be achieved. For example, a silencer of the present invention has been produced whereby the attenuation is a minimum of 20dB over the frequency range of 200 Hertz to at least 5000 Hertz. Although the present invention has particular utility when used in gas streams with particulate burdens, the invention is not so limited to such gases. The present invention may be used in substantially clean qases and also gases containing water or other contaminating vapours. However, when used in situations involving significant particulate burden in the gas stream, the apertures in a splitter may be so arranged as to constitute slits, lying substantially vertical to the direction of gas flow. The advantage of such an arrangement is that a large volume of particles would have to be deposited within individual resonators in order to substantially effect performance. The splitters may be wholly or partly within the cias stream or affixed to a duct wall provided that the direction of flow of gas is essentially over the apertures of the resonators. In another embodiment of the second aspect of the invention, wherein the gas contains substantial particulate and or vapor burden, one face of the splitter is positioned against an inner surface of the duct, all of the apertures are formed to lie in the plane of the other face and the apertures are slits lying substantially vertical to the direction of qas flow. It is also within the scope of this invention to position at least one splitter having apertures in both faces spaced apart from the inner surfaces of the duct and at least one splitter having apertures in one face only positioned against an inner surface in a manner such that all of the apertures are in communication with the gas stream. It is preferred that the percentage of duct cross sectional areas which is occupied by the splitters is between 20 and 60 . Hereinafter described by way of example only are four embodiments of the present invention in which Fig. 1 is a cross sectional view of a resonator of the prior art Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view of a pair of resonators according to this invention Fig. 3 is a cross sectional view of another pair of resonators Fig. 4 is a cross sectional view of a portion of a splitter according to this invention Fig. 5 is a graph showing the variation of attenuation with change in frequency for a resonator according to this invention and Fig. 6 is a cut away perspective view of a silencer according to this invention arranged in a duct. The resonator 10 described with reference to Fig. 1 comprises an array of walls 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 defininq an acoustic cavity 16. An opening 17 is in the first wall 11 and is formed into a passage 18 by the second wall 12 and baffle 13. The pair of resonators 20, 21 described with reference to Fig. 2 each comprises an array of walls 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 defining two acoustic cavities 34, 35. Apertures 31, 36 in the first walls 22, 23 are formed into passages 32, 33 by the second walls 24, 26 and baffles 25, 27. A common wall 28 joins the two resonators 20, 21 and the first walls 22, 23 form parallel faces. This figure represents the simplest case of a splitter, which would be capable of producinq resonance at a single frequency only. The pair of resonators 40, 41 described with reference to Fig. 3 each comprises an array of walls 42, 43, 44, 45, 46 47, 48 defining two acoustic cavities 49, 50. Apertures 51, 52 in the first walls 42, 43 are formed into passages 54, 53 by the second walls 46, 47 and baffles 45, 44. A common wall 48 joins the two resonators 40, 41 and the first walls 42, 43 form parallel faces.Again, this represents the simplest case of a splitter. The splitter 60 described with reference to Fig. 4 comprises a plurality of resonators 61, 62, 63 which are connected by a series of common walls 64, 65, 66. The first walls 67, 68, 69, 70 form parallel faces. Fig. 5 shows a graph of attentuation versus frequency for a given length of the baffle. Here the length is 225 mm and the normalized resistance of the aperture is one.It can be seen that the degree of attenuation is maximum at a frequency of approximately 100 Hz. In Fig. 6 a silencer 80, comprises two splitters 81, 82, mounted longitudinally in a duct 85 between the inner surfaces of the upper and lower portions of the duct. The direction of gas flow is as indicated in the figure.Individual resonators 86 are connected by a series of common walls not shown in a manner such that all of the apertures 87 lie in the planes of the first walls and the direction of gas flow is over the opening 87. In this embodiment, the apertures are formed into vertical slits.
