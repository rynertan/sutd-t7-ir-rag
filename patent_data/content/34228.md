## Description
REFORMING CATALYST, PREPARATION OF CATALYST AND REFORMING PROCESS FOR USING SUCH CATALYST This invention relates to a novel catalyst composition containing platinum, rhenium and iridium, a process for preparing this catalyst and to the reforming of selected petroleum fractions in the presence of this catalyst to obtain gasoline of high octane number. The present invention provides a catalyst composition which is a mixture of two components, one component containing a minor proportion of platinum and rhenium on a support and the second component containing a minor proportion of iridium on a separate support. The present invention further provides a reforming process which comprises contacting a reforming charge stock under reforming conditions with a catalyst which is a mixture of two components, one component containing a minor proportion of platinum and rhenium on a support and the second component containing a minor proportion of iridium on a separate support. The present invention also provides a process for preparing a catalyst composition which comprises impregnating particles of a support with a platinum compound and a rhenium compound, drying and calcining the platinum and rhenium containing particles in air, impregnating separate particles of a support with an iridium compound, drying and calcining the iridiumcontaining particles in an inert gas that does not contain oxygen and mixing the platinum and rheniumcontaining particles with the iridium containing particles. Catalysts intended for use in reforming operations wherein hydrocarbon fractions such as naphthas or gasolines or mixtures thereof are treated to improve the anti knock characteristics thereof are well known in the petroleum industry. It has heretofore been proposed to employ platinum metal containing catalysts for promoting reforming. Such catalysts are necessarily characterized by a certain amount of acidity. One type of reforming catalyst which has been used commercially consists of an alumina base material having platinum metal impregnated thereon, with the acidity characteristic being contributed by a small amount of halogen incorporated in the catalyst. In more recent years, multimetallic reforming catalysts, for example, bimetallic catalysts, have come into use. These catalysts generally contain platinum, together with one or more additional metals such as rhenium, germanium, iridium, palladium, osmium, ruthenium, rhodium, copper, silver, tin or gold desposited on a refractory support which also contains a specified amount of halogen. Representative of multimetallic reforming catalysts are those containing platinum and iridium, such as described in U.S. PatentNo. 2,848,377 and more recently in U.S. Patent No.3,953,368. The latter patent reports certain advantages when platinum and iridium are present on a refractory support as highly dispersed polymetallic clusters in which metallic atoms are separated by distances of about 2.5 to 4.0 Angstroms. It has also heretofore been known to conduct catalytic reforming utilizing a catalyst consisting essentially of a particularly defined mixture of particles of a porous carrier impregnated with a small amount of platinum and particles of an acidic cracking component. Representative disclosures of such prior art are to be found in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,854,400 2,854,403 and 2,854,404. Also, it has been suggested,,for example, in German O.S. No. 2,627 822 to conduct reforming in the presence of a catalyst constituting a mixture of platinum on one solid carrier and rhenium on a second solid carrier. All of the above catalysts, while possessing certain advantages, suffer from inherent deficiencies in either activity, stability or sensitivity to poisons e.g., sulfur, under severe reforming conditions. Recent environmental regulations prohibiting the use in gasoline of previously used octane number improvers such as tetraethyl lead have brought about a demand for reformate of increased octane number. Such products of high octane number can only be obtained under severe reforming conditions. However, these severe conditions greatly accelerate the aging of the reforming catalyst.The ability of a reforming catalyst to provide a high yield of gasoline of high octane number over an extended period of time is, as will be realized, a highly desirable attribute which has long been sought but not fully attained prior to the present invention. The catalyst of the present invention is a mixture of two components, one component containing a minor proportion of platinum and rhenium on a support and the second component containing a minor proportion of iridium on a separate support. More particularly, the catalyst comprises a refractory support, from 0.1 to 5 weight percent of platinum, from 0.1 to 5 weight percent of rhenium, from 0.1 to 5 weight percent of iridium and from 0.1 to 5 weight percent of halogen, with the platinum and rhenium being deposited on one support and iridium being deposited on a separate support. The relative weight ratio of the separate particles containing platinum rhenium and those containing iridium is generally between 10 1 and 1 10, preferably between 5 1 and 1 5. The dimensions of the separate particles may range from powder size, e.g., 0.01 micron up to particles of substantial size, e.g., 10,000 microns. Preferably, the particle size is between 1 and 3000 microns, with the size of the platinum rhenium containing and iridium containing particles either being of differing size within the above range or of substantially the same size. The refractory support of the present catalyst is a porous adsorptive material having a surface area exceeding 20 square meters per gram and preferably greater than about 100 square meters per gram.Refractory inorganic oxides are preferred supports, particularly alumina or mixtures thereof with silica.Alumina is particularly preferred and may be used in a large variety of forms including alumina, precipitate or gel, alumina monohydrate and sintered alumina. Various forms of alumina either singly or in combination, such as eta, chi, gamma, theta, delta or alpha alumina may be suitably employed as the alumina support. Preferably, the alumina is gamma alumina and or eta alumina. The above nomenclature used in the present specification and claims with reference to alumina phase designation is that generally employed in the United States and described in The Aluminum Industry Aluminum and itsProduction by Edwards, Frary and Jeffries, published byMcGraw Hill 1930 . The refractory support, desirably alumina, having a particle size of at least about 0.01 micron and generally not exceeding about 10,000 microns is contacted with a source of halogen. Both the particles of platinum rhenium containing refractory support and the separate particles of iridium containing refractory support will contain halogen. Halogen may be added to the support, preferably alumina, in a form which will readily react therewith in order to obtain the desired results. One feasible method of adding the halogen is in the form of an acid, such as hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen bromide, hydrogen chloride and or hydrogen iodide. Other suitable sources of halogen include salts such as ammonium fluoride and ammonium chloride. ZJhen such salts are used the ammonium ions will be removed during subsequent heating of the catalyst. Halogen may also be added as fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine or by treatment in gaseous hydrogen halide. The halogen, preferably a chlorine or fluorine moiety, may be incorporated into the catalyst at any suitable stage in the catalyst manufacture.Thus, halogen may be added before, after or during incorporation of the platinum rhenium and iridium on the separate particles of refractory support. Halogen is conveniently incorporated into the catalyst when impregnating the support with halogen containing metal compounds, such as chloroplatinic acid or chloroiridic acid. Additional amounts of halogen may be incorporated in the catalyst by contacting it with materials such as hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride, either prior to or subsequent to the metal impregnation step. Halogen may also be incorporated by contacting the catalyst with a gaseous stream containing the halogen, such as chlorine or hydrogen chloride. One feasible way to halogenate the alumina is by the addition of an alkyl halide such as tertiary butyl chloride during the reforming operation.The amount of halogen introduced into the support is such that the halogen content of the overall catalyst is between 0.1 and 5 weight percent. Such halogen content may be deposited on either the platinum rhenium containing or iridium containing particles, and desirably is present on both particles in an approximate weight rate range which may extend from 1 10 to 10 1 of the total halogen content. Generally, as a preferred and practical matter, the halogen content of each of the particles making up the catalyst of the invention will be approximately the same. The platinum and rhenium may be deposited on the support, desirably alumina, in any suitable manner.Generally, it is feasible to mix particles of support with a mixture of a platinum compound and a rhenium compound. Suitable platinum compounds include chloroplatinic acid, platinum tetrachloride, bromoplatinic acid, the ammonium salt of chloroplatinic or bromoplatinic acid. Suitable rhenium compounds include perrhenic acid HRe04 and ammonium perrhenate NH4BeO4 . The iridium metal may be deposited on the support, desirably alumina, by contacting with an appropriate iridium compound such as the ammonium chloride double salt, tribromide, trichloride, tetrachloride or chloroiridic acid. Iridium amine complexes may also suitably be employed. The impregnated platinum rhenium particles may then be calcined in air at an elevated temperature generally in the range of 800 to 10000F and the impregnated iridium particles calcined in an inert gas that does not contain oxygen, preferably nitrogen at a temperature between about 500 and about 7500F prior to the introduction of the catalyst into the reforming unit. In addition, the catalyst may be exposed to a hydrogen atmosphere to reduce a substantial portion of the metal components to the elemental state. In a preferred technique, the support particles are presaturated with gaseous carbon dioxide prior to impregnation with an aqueous solution or solutions of a compound or complex containing the desired metal or metals. It has been found that the carbon dioxide presaturation treatment provides good metal distribution throughout the support even at the high metal concentrations that the separate particle catalysts require, resulting in better catalytic properties. A carbon dioxide treatment may also be used following impregnation. Reforming of a hydrocarbon charge, such as a naphtha, can be effectively carried out over an extended period of time under conditions of high severity to produce a high yield of gasoline of high octane number, e.g., 100 R 0, when the reforming is carried out in the presence of the catalysts of the present invention. Reforming utilizing the present catalysts is conducted in the presence of hydrogen under reforming conditions. The latter include a temperature between 7000F and 11000F and more usually between 8000F and 10000F a pressure within the range of 50 to 1000 psig and preferably between 100 and 700 psig and a weight hourly space velocity of between 0.1 and 10 and preferably between 0.5 and 4. The molar ratio of hydrogen to hydrocarbon charge is generally between about 0.5 and about 20 and preferably between about 2 and about 12. Since the reforming process produces large quantities of hydrogen, at least a portion thereof may be conveniently employed for the introduction of hydrogen with the feed. Charge stocks undergoing reforming, using the catalyst described herein, are those conventionally employed. These include virgin naphtha, cracked naphtha, gasoline including FCC gasoline or mixtures thereof boiling within the approximate range of 70 to 5000F and, preferably within the range of 120 to 4500F. Using the catalysts of the present invention, it has been found that it is possible to operate under more severe reforming conditions, for example, those which will produce a gasoline having an octane number of 100 R 0, than is capable of achievement with other platinum iridium, platinum rhenium or platinum rhenium iridium catalysts in which all of the metals are deposited on the same support particle. Such severe reforming conditions include, for example, a pressure of 250 psig, a weight hourly space velocity of 2, a total recycle ratio of 7 and a product of 100 R 0 octane number. It is possible with the present process to achieve such high octane gasoline even with difficult charge stocks such as an Arab light C6 3600F naphtha. A very distinct advantage of the trimetallic reforming catalyst described herein containing separate platinum rhenium alumina and iridium alumina particles is its ability to maintain its catalytic activity under conditions of high severity over an extended period of time. In a typical commercial reforming process, reaction temperature is increased during the course of the run to maintain a constant product octane level.Increasing the reaction temperature becomes necessary since the catalyst is continuously deactivated.Cenerally, the reaction temperature cannot exceed about 10000F before rapid deactivation of the catalyst is encountered. Accordingly, as the reaction temperature approaches about 10000F, it is usually necessary to regenerate the catalyst. Regeneration is accomplished by burning the coke deposit from the catalyst and then treating with chlorine, HCl oxygen mixtures or organic chloride oxygen mixtures to rejuvenate the catalyst and thereby restore its activity and selectivity. Since the catalyst of the present invention maintains its catalytic activity over an extended period of time, inlet temperatures do not have to be increased as rapidly, thus reducing the frequency of the need for regeneration. For example, the present catalyst containing separate platinum rhenium on alumina and iridium on alumina particles has maintained a 100 R 0 octane level at an inlet temperature of approximately 9500F for about 50 days and can be used with increasing temperature for an extended period before needing regeneration. By comparison, a catalyst containing separate platinum on alumina and iridium on alumina particles at the same condition will require an inlet temperature in excess of 9800F at 20 days.The aging rate of the present catalysts as measured by the increase in degrees Fahrenheit of the inlet temperature per day OF day is demonstrated in the Examples. It is contemplated that the present catalyst described may be employed in any of the conventional types of processing equipment. Thus, the catalyst may be used in the form of discrete particles or the components, in finely divided form, may be admixed and pelleted, cast, molded, extruded or otherwise formed into pieces of desired size and shape, such as rods, spheres, granules, pellets and extrudates, it being essential that each of the pieces is composed of particles of both components. The catalyst may be dispersed as a fixed bed within a reaction zone. The charge stock may be passed through the catalyst bed as a liquid, vapor or mixed phase in either upward or downward flow. The catalyst may also be used in a form suitable for moving beds.In such instance, the charge stock and catalyst are contacted in a reforming zone wherein the charge stock may be passed in concurrent or countercurrent flow to the catalyst. Alternatively, a suspensoid type process may be employed in which the catalyst is slurried in the charge stock and the resulting mixture conveyed to the reaction zone. The reforming process is generally carried out in a series of several reactors. Usually, three to five reactors are used. The catalyst of the invention may be employed in just one of the reactors, e.g., the first reactor or in several of the reactors or in all of the reactors.After reaction, the product from any of the above processes is separated from the catalyst by known techniques and conducted to distillation columns where the various desired components are obtained by fractionation. In accordance with one embodiment of this invention, it is possible to isolate the platinumrhenium containing portion of the catalyst from the iridium containing portion since the same are located on separate particles. Thus should a catalyst of the present invention become deactivated due to the loss of activity of either the platinum rhenium containing portion or the iridium containing portion of the catalyst it is only necessary to activate that portion of the catalyst which is adversely affected rather than the whole catalyst. It is thus possible to provide separate and optimum means for ready regeneration of each of the two components.For example, the catalyst of the present invention, after becoming spent, may be separated into its platinum rhenium containing components and iridium containing components by providing the respective particles with a different physical characteristic which permit their ready separation, such as a difference in particle size. The particles of differing size may be separated by flotation, air blowing sifting or by any of the various other known means for separating physically and or chemically different materials. The separated platinumrhenium containing and iridium containing particles may then be separately regenerated under conditions best suited for each. The ability to select the amount of platinumrhenium containing component and the amount of iridiumcontaining component making up the ultimate catalyst mixture has the advantage that the amount of platinum and rhenium as well as the amount of iridium contained in the catalyst, can be controlled not only by the respective concentrations of the platinum rhenium and iridium impregnating solutions used but also by the respective amounts of the platinum rhenium containing and the iridium containing components of the catalyst.If the tri metallic catalyst of this invention is used in the form of a mixture of particles, the two components of the mixture will be physically independent. Accordingly a process using catalysts in this form affords substantial flexibility in catalyst composition within the limits noted hereinabove. Thus, in changing type of charge stocks such as between paraffinic and naphthenic stocks, the catalyst composition can be adjusted with respect to activity and or selectivity for optimum performance in accordance with this invention by adding or withdrawing portions of one or the other of the catalyst components. It is also within the purview of this invention to select the refractory support most suitable for use with the metal deposited thereon. The separate particles making up the present catalyst afford flexibility in choice of refractory support, such as the type of alumina employed. Thus, in one embodiment it is contemplated that iridium is desirably deposited on the more acidic eta form of alumina with platinum rhenium being deposited on the gamma form of alumina. Such catalyst would have the advantage of reducing the amount of light hydrocarbons, such as methane and ethane to yield a stream of hydrogen of enhanced purity, suitable for recycle or other use.
