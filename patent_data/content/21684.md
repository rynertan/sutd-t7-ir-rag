# Process of producing A 42355 antibiotic mixture and A 30912 antibiotics as well as a pure culture of the producing micro organism.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for preparing the A 42355 antibiotic mixture which comprises A 30912 factors A, B, D, and H, and the individual factors, A 30912 factor A, A 30912 factor B, A 30912 factor D and A 30912 factor H, which comprises cultivating the newly isolated Aspergillus nidulans var. roseus NRRL 11440 in a culture medium containing assimilable sources of carbohydrate, nitrogen, and inorganic salts under submerged aerobic fermentation conditions until a substantial amount of antibiotic activity is produced, separating the antibiotic mixture from the culture medium, and if desired, isolating the individual factors from the antibiotic mixture.
