# A METHOD FOR DETECTING DRUG INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA AND AN IMMUNOASSAY KIT FOR USE IN THE SAME

## Abstract
There is disclosed a method for detecting drug induced thrombocytopenia, which comprises the steps of a treating blood platelets with serum or plasma derived from a patient suspected of having a drug induced throm bocytopenia and with a drug suspected of causing the thrombocytopenia b incubating the treated platelets for from 15 to 25 minutes at a temperature of from 21 C to 24 C c washing the incubated platelets with a wash solution containing the drug and then resuspending the platelets d contacting, and incubating together, the resuspended platelets with a solid support having a specific binding protein bound thereto, e decanting unbound platelets f measuring the bound platelets by i contacting, and incubating, the solid support having platelets bound thereto and an enzyme conjugate ii removing unbound material iii contacting. and incubating together, the support platelet enzyme conjugate complex, and a substrate and iv determining the quantity of substrate acted upon by the enzyme conjugate and g comparing the determined quantity with at least one of a standard value and a value derived by subjecting a drug free control to steps a to f .
