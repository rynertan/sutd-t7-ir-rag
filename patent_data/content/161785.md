## Description
HALOGENATED BTTTYL RUBBER AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING SAME This invention relates to improved halogenated butyl rubbers, methods of using them and processes for producing them. One of the first olefinically unsaturated synthetic elastomers to be commercially produced was butyl rubber. The expression butyl rubber is used in the rubber industry to describe copolymers made from a polymerization reaction mixture having therein from 70 to 99.5 by weight of an isoolefin which has about 4 to 7 carbon atoms, e.g. isobutylene, and about 30 to 0.5S by weight of a conjugated multiolefin having from 4 to 14 carbon atoms, e.g. isoprene. The resulting copolymers contain 85 to 99.5 by weight combined isoolefin and about 0.5 to about 13 combined multiolefin. The preparation of butyl rubber is descried inU.S. Patent No. 2,356,12B, which is incorporated herein by reference. Butyl rubber generally has a number average molecular weight of about 5,000 to about 500,000, pre ferably 80,000 to 250,000 and a Wijs Iodine No. of about 0.5 to 50 preferably 1 to 15. Low molecular weight butyl rubber is generally defined as having a Mv of 5,000 to 30,000 and 2 10 mole t unsaturation. The viscosity average molecular weight Mv of commercial butyl rubber is about 100,000 to about 500,000, preferably about 250,000 to 500,000. The polymer backbone of commercial butyl rubber is made up primarily of isobutylene units, with just a few percent isoprene units. The isoprene units contribute the small amount of unsaturation present in butyl rubber. The basic preparative equations are represented by EMI2.1 isobutylene isoprene isoprene which combine to form its main structure 4EMI2.2 wherein n 1 represents the number of isoolefin units incorporated in the butyl rubber, while m represents the number of diolefin units present, substantially as isolated units. The conjugated diolefin loses its diene unsaturation upon its incorporation into the polymer backbone. Thus butyl rubber, as presently produced, contains only a small percentage of unsaturation, in the form of the monoolefin structure associated with the isoprene residue which is incorporated more or less randomly throughout the polymer chain. The reactivity of the butyl rubbers and consequently their cure rate is substantially less than the high unsaturation natural and synthetic rubbers. In an effort to improve cure characteristics of the butyl rubbers, these synthetic polymers have been halogenated.Halogenated butyl rubber has contributed significantly to the elastomer industry. A method of preparing halogenated butyl rubber is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,099,644 which is incorporated herein by reference. Both chlorinated and brominated butyl rubbers are known in the art.The structural formula for halogenated butyl rubber is typically represented as being EMI3.1 where X represents the halogen and n, 1 and m have the same values as described above for butyl rubber. This structure, however, is one of several which can be formed, depending on the conditions of halogenation and the halogenating agent used. Other structural configurations which may occur in halogenated butyl rubbers areEMI3.2 EMI4.1 It will be noted that in each case the halogen is present as a secondary or tertiary allylic halogen. More recently, U.S. Patent o. 4,288,575 toIrwin Gardner which has an effective filing date of March 7, 1977 discloses a new structural configuration for the halogenated rubber where the rubber contains conjugated diene which is represented asEMI4.2 In this structure the halogen, X, is in a primary allylic position. The method disclosed in U.S.Patent o. 4,288,575 for preparing these rubbers involves the use of a copper oxide catalyst useful for dehydrohalogenation of butyl rubber to form a conjugated diene rubber. As shown in Example 6 of the Gardner 575 patent this primary halogen is in a more stable configuration than the secondary halogens of the prior art and is not readily removed. The copper oxide catalyst was taught in Gardner s earlier U.S. Patent No. 4,145,492 to be a dehydrohalogenation catalyst suitable for the preparation of conjugated diene rubber. Where Gardner produces polymers containing the structure of Formula V that structure is invariably associated with conjugated diene. Table I of U.S. Patent No. 4,288,575 shows various halogenated conjugated diene containing polymers which are shown to have the halogen in the primary position. Not surprisingly, the residual halogen is always associated with substantial amounts of conjugated diene.Since the catalyst is a dehydrohalogenation catalyst, dehydrohalogenation is proportional to the degree of contact of polymer with the catalyst, and similarly, the degree of rearrangement of halogen from the secondary to the primary position is related to the degree of dehydrohalogenation. Where high amounts of residual halogen are present in the polymer, as in Run A of Table I of U.S.Patent No. 4,288,575, it is the result of an initiallly high level of halogenation here 1.95 wt. รง bromine. Since the degree of rearrangement is proportional to the degree of dehydrohalogenation Gardner s polymers cannot be low in conjugated diene and at the same time have appreciable amounts of halogen present in the primary allylic position. t In 1979 Van Tongerloo et. al. disclosed a brominated butyl rubber which was low in conjugated diene content if any and had the primary halogen configuration.The polymer is represented as having the structure EMI6.1 The reference states that the polymer was produced by a proprietary method and Van Tongerloo et. al. disclose only that rearrangement to the more stable primary configuration can be accomplished in brominated butyl rubber under a variety of conditions for example, in the presence of acid, free radicals, bases or heat. See Van Tongerloo, A.and Vukov, R., Proceedings, International Rubber Conference, Milan, Italy, 1979, p.70ff. The skilled chemist will recognize that this gratuitous disclosure represents the techniques which can be enumerated to accomplish an infinite number of reactions. The disclosure in no way teaches any method to prepare the polymer disclosed. Van Tongerloo at. al. designate the methylene configuration of formula VI above as EXO and the primary bromo configuration of Formula V as ENDO . It is alleged that even at ratios of ENDO EXO of 71 16 there is no clear indication of a correlation between vulcanizate properties and polymer microstructure. Hence, Van Tongerloo et. al. have not appreciated that the polymer which they purportedly made by an undisclosed proprietary process has any properties which are different than those of conventional halogenated butyl rubber. Subsequent to the making of the instant invention, Vukov disclosed that certain model compounds can be heated to 1500C for 30 minutes to accomplish a molecular rearrangement as follows EMI7.1 No substantial rearrangement of the chlorinated model was observed. See Vukov, R., Halogenation of Butyl Rubber and The Zinc Oxide Cross Linking Chemistry of Halogenated Derivatives which was presented to the ACS Rubber Division on October 25, 1983. Those skilled in the art will recognize that what is true about simple molecules model compounds may not necessarily be true about complex polymer molecules. It has surprisingly Seen found that halogenated butyl rubbers, low in conjugated diene, having a substan tial portion of their halogen in a primary configuration can be prepared by the rearrangement of the structure of conventional chlorinated and brominated butyl rubber. These unique polymers surprisingly exhibit more rapid cure rates and better vulcanized adhesion to high unsaturated rubbers than can be achieved with conventional brominated butyl rubber. Surprisingly, the chlorinated butyl rubbers of this invention exhibit a faster cure rate than conventional brominated butyl rubbers. The isomerization of conventional halogenated butyl rubber to the novel rubbers of the invention may be accomplished in accordance with the process of the invention using a Friedel Crafts catalyst or HBr as the catalyst. In one aspect the present invention provides a halogenated butyl rubber wherein a significant fraction of the available halogen is present as a primary allylic halogen.In particular such a halogenated butyl rubber has a conjugated diene unsaturation content of less than 0.25 mole O, a halogen content of at least 0.6 wt , and at least 20 mole of the halogen is in a primary allylic configuration, Such rubbers have been found to have improved cure and adhesion properties. In the practice of this invention a conventional halogenated butyl rubber, prepared using commercially known techniques is treated to cause an isomeric rearrangement of the halogen from the secondary allylic configuration to a primary allylic configuration. The isoprene utilized in the manufacture of butyl rubber is generally incorporated into the rubber in the following configuration EMI8.1 the halogen is generally incorporated in a configuration depicted asEMI8.2 wherein X is halogen. The site of unsaturation is external to the backbone of the polymer.In the butyl rubber polymers of this invention the halogen is incorporated in a structure having the configuration EMI9.1 Other halogen configurations includeEMI9.2 Throughout the specification and claims the configurations of formulas VIII, IX and X will be referred to as Type I,II and III configuration respectively. The polymers of this invention are distinguished from the polymers of U.S. Patent No. 4,288,575 in that they contain less than 0.25 mole conjugated diene and at least 0.6 wt. รง halogen, wherein at least 20 mole to 100 mole of the halogen is in the Type III configuration. Preferably 25 mole ta 90 mole percent of the halogen will be present in the Type III configuration, more preferably, at least 30 mole to 85 mole , and most preferably at least 40 mole of the halogen is present as the Type III configuration. The halogenated butyl rubber may be either chlorinated or brominated. The halogen content is preferably at least 0.8 wt. X to 2.4 wt. , more preferably the halogenated butyl rubber contains at least 0.9 wt. X halogen to 1.8 wt. , e.g. about 1.4 wt Dt. In the process of preparing the halogenated butyl rubber of this invention some halogen may be lost as a result of some degree of dehydrohalogenation which may result in the formation of a conjugated diene structure.The conjugated diene CD content of the polymer, however, will be less than 0.25 mole 0. Generally, the CD content will be less than 0.20 mole X preferably less than 0.15 mole รง In the preparation of the halogenated butyl rubber of this invention the halogenated rubber is prepared by treating conventional halogented butyl rubber with aFriedel Crafts catalyst, e.g. ZnC12. The brominated form is prepared by treating conventional brominated butyl rubber with HBr. In the Friedel Crafts catalytic isomerization of halogenated butyl rubber the halogenated butyl rubber is dissolved in a nonpolar solvent and contacted with a Friedel Crafts catalyst. Preferably, the reaction can be carried out in the presence of anhydrous HC1 or anhydrousHBr, preferably selecting the same halogen for the acid as is present in the catalyst. Any hydrocarbon which is a solvent of butyl rubber can be used as the nonpolar solvent. Illustrative non limiting examples of such solvents are hexane, heptane, octane, toluene, xylene. Since butyl rubber is generally halogenated in a solution of hexane, hexane is the preferred solvent. The concentration of halogenated butyl rubber in solvent is not critical. However, the concentration must not be so small as to make the process uneconomical or so large that the polymer cement is too viscous to handle. Preferably, the polymer concentration in the solvent is from 5 wt. ร to 25 wt. , more preferably from 10 wt. L to 15 wt. L. The Friedel Crafta catalyst can be added directly to the polymer solution or it can first be dissolved in dimethyl ether. Dissolving the catalyst in ether results in a fine dispersion of catalyst upon addition to the hexane cement. Preferably, in selecting a halogenated catalyst the halogen of the catalyst corresponds to the halogen of the polymer. Suitable Friedel Crafts catalysts include ZnCl2, Fecal3, BF3, BCl3, aluminum alkyl halides and trialkyl aluminum of the formulas R3Al, R2AlX and RAlX2 wherein R is an alkyl group of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, preferably C1 C2 alkyl, and X is halogen preferably chlorine or bromine gallium chloride, zinc bromide, aluminum chloride, aluminum bromide, and antimony halides. The ratio of catalyst to rubber on a weight basis is preferably 1 100 to 1 1000, more preferably 1 200 to 1 300. The reaction temperature can vary from about 200C to 1500C, preferably 400C to 1300C, more preferably 600C to OOC, e.g. 900C. The reaction time is preferably2 minutes to 3 hrs. Longer reaction times may be used since the rearrangement results in stable polymer. More preferably, the reaction time is 5 minutes to 60 minutes. The quantity of anhydrous HC1 or HBr, when used, is not critical. However, it is preferably present in excess with respect to the Friedel Crafts catalyst. The ratio of HCl or HBr to catalyst is preferably 0.5 1 to 100 1, more preferably 5 1 to 20 1 , most preferably 10 1r In a preferred method the HCl or HBr is added by purging the reaction mixture with a stream of anhydrous HCl or HBr continuously throughout the reaction. The method of this invention for the isomerization of conventional chlorinated butyl rubber to the primary allylic chlorine containing polymer of this invention is illustrated by the following examples EXAMPLE I A commercial chlorinated butyl rubber was dissolved in heptane so that a 15 by weight solution of rubber 928 grams was prepared. ZnCl2 was dissolved in ether 3.1 grams in 25 ml and added with constant stirring to the chlorinated butyl rubber cement which had been heated to 840 C. The mixture was purged with a continuous gas stream of anhydrous HCl at a rate of about 11.5 cc min.The weight ratio of HCl to ZnCl2 was about 10 1. The results are tabulated in Table I.

EXAMPLE II The method of Example I was repeated with minor modifications. The ZnCl2 was added directly to the polymer cement without first dissolving it in ether. The reaction time was 135 minutes. It was found that the ZnCl2 was wet therefore 4 grams of Fecal3 was added and reacted for an additional 35 minutes. The product had a chlorine content of 1.09 wt as determined by X ray analysis , aMooney viscosity of 21.2 ML l 8 I250C , a CD content of 0.05 mole w and a Mv of 415,000. The ratio of Ttpe I, II,III and IV configuration as found by 400 MHz NMR was 0.12 0.55 0.22 0.11. EXAMPLE III Example I was repeated using 528 grams of chlorinated butyl rubber in heptane 15 wt solution . Four grams of fresh ZnCl2 was added and the isomerization was carried out for about 66 minutes at 900C. The anhydrous HCl flow rate was about 15 cc min. The system was then cooled to OOC and 89 Cl2 was added through a glass frit in order to further halogenate the polymer. The final product had a chlorine content of 1.42 wt , a Mooney of 16.5, an Mv of 290,000 and a residual zinc content of 60 ppm. The number average molecular weight was 114,000. Based on 400 MHz NMR the ratio of types I, II, III and IV configuration was 0.0 0.66 0.26 0.08. Ihe GD content was 0.14 mole percent. EXAMPLE IV The polymers of Examples I, II and III were tested in zinc oxide cures against commercial chlorinated and brominated butyl rubber. The results are shown in Tables II and III.

The surprising finding here is that the chlorinated polymer 26X type III of this invention has a faster cure than a brominated polymer having a bromine content of 1.85 wt. Compare E and F .

In comparison to the reference polymer R II it still shows a significantly higher state of cure, faster initial cure rate slope and shorter cure initiation time. Compared to a commercially produced chlorinated butyl rubber sample containing 1.35 wt. chlorine and calcium stearate, the isomerized halobutyl had a higher state of cure, and significantly faster initial cure rate slope . EXAMPLE V Example I was repeated using 200 grams of a 25 solution of chlorinated butyl rubber. Instead of ZnCl2, the catalyst used was 0.3279 of FeCl3 in 669 of 3C13. The reaction was carried out at 500C and the results are shown inTable IV. The a content of the product was essentially zero. TABLE IV Run Cl Configuration Type Mv Time wtK I II III x10 3 gel 20 1.06 0 .29 .71 359 12.4 60 1.05 708 105 gel It is apparent that ferric chloride is a more active catalyst and shorter reaction times can be used to achieve a high degree of isomerization. EXAMPLE VI H2S04 was used in an attempt to isomerize brominated butyl rubber. Concentrated H2S04 t16g was added to 300 grams of rubber in 2700 grams of solvent Isobar G, an isooctane process by product . The reaction e2s run at 800 C. The bromine content was reduced from 1.85 t to 1.4 wt. The viscosity average molecular weight of the rubber was reduced to 17,000 from an original value of 492,000. While significant isomerization occurred, the gross degradation of molecular weight resulted in a product which has value only as a low molecular weight brominated butyl rubber. In applications requiring high molecular weight such a material would not be useful. EXAMPLE VII Approxinately 290 grams of a 20 solution of brominated butYl rubber was heated with HBr at 300C. About 110 cc min of Br was bubbled through the solution and samples removed periodically for analyses.The results are shown in Table V, except for QD content of the final product, which was 0.10 mole percent.

Attempts to cause rearrangement of chlorinated butyl rubber usingHCl were unsuccessful. EXAMPLE VIII The experiment of Example VII was repeated over a temperature range of 52 to 420C. After 397 seconds of treatment with anhydrous HBr the bromine content increased from 1.87L to 2.13 wits while the Mv which was initially 492,000, dropped to 370,000. The ratio of TypeI, II, III and IV configuration was 0.1 0.17 0.56 0.17 as compared to original values of 0.162 0.764 0.074 0. Hence, the low temperature treatment of brominated butyl with HBr results in substantial rearrangement with an acceptable degree of degradation of the polymer. The CD content of the product was 0.06 mole percent. It is apparent from the forgoing examples that it is insufficient merely to select an acid to accomplish the isomerization of this invention. The appropriate acid must be selected and it must be utilized at the proper temperature. Otherwise, severe degradation of the base polymer i.e. reduction in molecular weight, occurs. The viscosity average molecular weight of the product of the inventio is preferably Rt least 100,000, more preferably at least 200,000, most preferably at least 250,000 e.g. at least 300,000. In conducting the isomerization process of this invention to produce a brominated butyl rubber having a significant fraction of the bromine in the primary allylic configuration the reaction temperature should be less than 400C, preferably less than 300C, more preferably less than 100C e.g. less than OOC. In a particularly preferred embodiment sub zero reaction temperatures in the order of 100C to about 1000C may be advantageously used preferably the sub zero temperature utilized in carrying out the process of this invention is from 30 to 750C. The reaction time may vary eg from 2 minutes to 3 hours, preferably from 5 minutes to 60 minutes. The isomerization of the brominated butyl rubber is carried out in solution using a non polar hydrocarbon solvent. The solvents suitable for the chlorinated butyl rubber isomerization reaction may be used for brominated butyl rubber also. The concentration of polymer in the solvent is preferably 5 to 25 by weight as in the chlorinated polymer, and the preferred polymer concentration is 10V to 2sus. The HBr is preferably anhydrous, and an excess of acid relative to polymer is required. The mole ratio of acid to brominated polymer should be 0.5 1 to 50 1, preferably 6 1 to 12 1, e.g. about 10 1. The modified cure response observed with halogenated butyl rubbers having a significant amount of halogen in the primary allylic configuration suggests that they may covulcanize with other rubbers and have improved adhesion. This is demonstrated by the following examples.EXAMPLE IX A commercial sample of brominated butyl rubber produced in a solution process SOL Br Bu was compared with an isomerized brominated butyl rubber of this invention in a zinc oxide cure system as described below.
