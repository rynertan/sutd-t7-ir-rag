Elliott attorney s docket number CR 7795 discloses an improved process for preparing the N methylaminobenzophenone anti oxime used as the starting material in Middleton s improved process discussed immediately above. The Bingham and Elliott process. can be summarized schematically by the following equations EMI4.1 where X is C1, Br, NO2 or CF3 Y is H, C1, Br or F and Z is I, Br, CF3SO2O , FSO2O, CC13SO2O or CH3OSO2 0 . Bingham and Elliott also disclose that the starting material quinazolinone 3 oxides can be prepared by a process taught by Sulkowski and Childress, J. Org.Chem., 27, 4424 1962 . SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an improved process for making the quinazolinone 3 oxides of formula 1 , above, and an alternate process for making the quinazolinone 3 oxides of formula 3 , above. More specifically, the present invention re lates to an improved process for preparing 6 susti tuted 4 phenylquinazolione 3 oxides by the treatment of 2 aminobenzophenone isocyanate reaction products with hydroxylamine salts. Organic isocyanates of formula RNCO where R is hydrocarbyl or halohydrocarbyl of 1 8 carbon atoms react with 2 aminobenzophenones of formula I X C1,Br, CF3 or NO2 Y H, Br, C1 or F R1 H or CH3 to give either ureas of.formula II or quinazolinones of formula III X, Y and R1 as previously defined , depending on the reaction conditions and the isocyanates used.EMI5.1 These reaction products either or both II and III can then be converted to quinazolinone oxides of formula IV by treating them with an acid salt of hydroxylamine.EMI6.1 where A is an organic or inorganic acid with a pKa of less than 2. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF,THE INVENTIONProcess Conditions Quinazolinone oxides oif formula IV can be prepared by heating a solution or mixture of 2 aminobenzophenoneisocyanate reaction products of Formula II orIII and an acid addition salt of hydroxylamine in an alcohol solvent. The reaction is conveniently carried out at the reflux temperature of the alcohol solvent, but temperatures from 400 to 2000C are operable. Alcohol solvents useful for this reaction include, but are not limited to, ethanol, methanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, 2 methoxyethanol, ethylene glycol, and propylene glycol.Salts of hydroxylamine useful in this reaction include salts with organic or inorganic acids having a pKa of less than 2, such as hydroxylamine hydrochloride, hydroxylamine hydrobromide and hydroxylamine sulfate. The time required for the reaction varies from a few minutes when more reactive isocyanate adducts or higher boiling alcohols are used, to a few days or even weeks when less reactive isocyanate adducts or lower hoiling alcohols are used. The product quinazolinone oxides can be isolated from the reaction mixture by conventional means.In most cases, the quinazolinone oxides are considerably less soluble than the reactants, and will precipitate during the course of the reaction. When this occurs, the product quinazolinone oxides can be isolated by simply filtering the reaction mixture. The 2 aminobenzophenone isocyanate adducts used as starting materials can be prepare b the rac tion of 2 aminobenzophenones with organic isocyanates as illustrated in the following Examples or as described by Sulkowski et al. J. Org. Chem., 27 4424 1962 or byMetlesics et al., J. Org. Chef., 31 1007 it56 . Alternatively, the compounds of formula IV can be prepared by heating a compound of formula II in a suitable alcohol followed by treatment with a suitable acid addition salt of hydroxylamine.EMI7.1 where R20H is lower aliphatic alcohol of 1 6 carbon atoms, preferably methanol or ethanol.
