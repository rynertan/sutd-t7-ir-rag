# Polymer powder compositions, particularly polyethylene powder compositions, and objects to be made and made thereof.

## Abstract
The invention relates to polymer powder compositions consisting of 1 99 wt of a polymer powder component A and 99 1 wt of a polymer powder component B, the average particle size of component A being smaller than that of component B, and to the preparation of hollow objects by rotational molding using these polymer powder composi tions.
