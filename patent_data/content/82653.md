## Description
PLANT POT AND PROCESS FOR ITS MANUFACTUREThis invention relates to plant pots of the type which are used to germinate seedlings, cutting or the like and then disintegrate once they have been planted out.Such a plant pot must possess sufficient strength to support the soil, compost or other growing medium of the plant from its initial sowing to planting out.The growing medium may be continually wet, and so the pot must be sufficiently water resistant to prevent disintegration and allow handling prior to planting out. The plant pot should be easy to fill and preferably should be slightly tapered to allow access of air to the roots through the pot walls when the pots are side by side on a germinating tray. Tapering also facilitates stacking of the pots prior to filling with growing medium.Various materials have previously been used for making such plant pots, for example peat, bitumenised kraft paper board, black polythene and foamed polystyrene.However none of these are free from disadvantages.Plant pots constructed from foamed polystyrene or black polythene are impermeable to air, moisture and roots and must be removed before planting out since they will not disintegrate to an adequate extent.Another problem with foamed polystyrene is that it may transmit more light to the roots than is acceptable, whilst black polythene plant pots are too flimsy to fill easily. Plant pots constructed from bitumenised kraft paper board tend to lack strength, do not disintegrate properly and require slits to be cut in in the pot wall to facilitate drainage. Peat pots are fragile, particularly when dry and cannot easily be made in large sizes.It is an object of the invention to obviate or at least reduce the aforementioned disadvantages. It has been proposed in DT OS 1611734 to manufacture decomposable containers for plants by applying synthetic thermoplastic material to a decomposable fibrous material, particularly cellulose containing fibrous material,comminuting the product so obtained, mixing with water to form a pulp, draining the pulp while press moulding it into container shapes, and drying the containers so formed at temperatures ranging from 100 2500C.It has now surprisinalv been found that plant nots having excellent properties mav be formed from a paper web made from a heat bonded blend of fibres of vegetable origin and synthetic thermoplastic fibres.This approach avoids the necessity in the proposal according to DT OS 1611734 for the step of applying the synthetic thermoplastic material to the fibrous material and for a subsequent comminution step, both of which lead to increased expense.In a first aspect therefore, the present invention resides in a plant pot formed from a root penetrable heat bonded paper web comprising a blend of fibres of vegetable origin and synthetic thermoplastic fibres.In a second aspect the present invention resides in a process for the manufacture of plant pots comprising the steps of forming a paper web from a blend of fibres of vegetable origin and synthetic thermoplastic fibres, heating the web thus formed to a temperature at which heat bonding occurs and forming the resultant heat bonded web into a plant pot.The synthetic thermoplastic fibres may be of a variety of thermoplastic materials for example polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl alcohol and polyesters. Polyethylene fibres have so far been found to be preferred.The polyolefin fibres used should desirably be of the kind specially produced for use in paper making and usually known in the paper industry as synthetic wood pulp fibres. However chopped staple fibres may be used. Suitable synthetic wood pulp fibres are for example the polyethylene fibres marketed under the names Pulpex by Hercules, 1SWP by CrownZellerbach and Ferlosa by Montedison Pulpex fibres were formerly marketed by Solvay . The synthetic thermoplastic fibres may carry a loading of clay or other mineral.The fibres of vegetable origin may be of any of the cellulose pulps commonly used in paper making, for example unbleached kraft or bleached kraft pulp, optionally mixed with bark and or peat fibres.Preferably the synthetic thermoplastic fibres are present in an amount of between 15 and 50 of the total fibre content the remaining 85 to 50 being fibres of vegetable origin , as pots with a synthetic content below 15 tend not to withstand repeated handling before planting out and excessive synthetic content leads to increased expense without any commensurate improvement in performance. The amount of thermoplastic fibre used is more preferably between 15 and 30 by weight of the total fibre content.A synthetic thermoplastic fibre content of 25 is particularly suitable.The temperature at which heat bonding of the paper from which the plant pot is made is effected is preferably 130 150 0C in the case of polyethylene fibres and 90 100 C in the case of polyvinylalcohol fibres.The paper from which the plant pots are made may be made on conventional papermaking equipment, for example a Fourdrinier papermachine, using foamed or unfoamed stock.The paper from which the plant pot is made may be treated with fungicide to prevent mould growth but since some fungicides tend to inhibit root growth, care must be taken with regard to the amount used. Typically about 0.5 to 1.0 is suitable. The fungicide is conveniently incorporated in the web during or shortly after its formation, and prior to formation of the pot.The paper from which the plant pot is made may be dyed if desired. Again care must be taken with the type and amount of dye used because some types of dye may kill the roots or at least inhibit root growth.Preferably the plant pot is formed on conventional paper cup or bag making machinery, the presence of synthetic thermoplastic fibres enabling the product to be heat sealed into shape if necessary.The total grammage of the paper from which the plant pot is formed is preferably in the range between 50 and 2 2 250 gm and more preferably between 60 and 120 gm 2It is conveniently about 100 gm To facilitate root penetration it is preferable that the burst strength of the heat bonded paper, is between 40 and 200 kPa and is more preferably between 80 and 100 kPa.For the same reason, it is also preferable that the porosity of the paper is reasonably high. Air resistance is used to measure porosity and is preferably between 6 and 30 mm W.G. at a face velocity of 20m min l and is more preferably between 8 and 15mm W.G. l at a face velocity of 20m min . Whilst the ranges of burst strength and air resistance values quoted above are generally applicable, it may in practice be found difficult with certain plants to achieve adequate root penetration if both the burst strength and air resistance are towards the top end of their respective ranges. Moreover, if a fungicide is used which has the effect of inhibiting root growth, adequate root penetration may not be achieved even with a very low air resistance, if the burst strength is towards the high end of the preferred range. The selection of a suitable blend of properties should not however prove difficult, although a certain amount of preliminary testing may be necessary. Guidance as to suitable paper characteristics is of course available from the Examples set out below. The present plant pot may if desired be perforated in order to increase its root penetrability, although this is not essential for adequate performance.Perforation does however offer the possibility of imparting acceptable root penetrability to a material which would otherwise be inadequate in this respect Perforation of the plant pot paper may for example be achieved by mechanical means or by spark perforation before the paper is formed into a plant not but after the paper web has been heat bonded.Mechanical perforation may be achieved in a generally conventional manner, for example by passing the plant pot paper between a perforatinz roll, i.e. a roll having probes, spikes. needles or other perforating members, about its circumference, and a backing roll.Alternatively mechanical perforation may be achieved by puncturing the plant pot paper with a perforating member, such as a small probe or needle, in a random mannerSpark perforation may be achieved in the manner set out in our UK Patent Publication No. 20792 2A. The paper to be perforated is passed between a series of electrodes which emit sparks causing perforations in the material. The apparatus for carrying out the spark perforation of a sheet material. comprises spaced apart first and second electrodes which define between them a sparking zone through which the sheet material to be perforated can be moved in a predetermined direction.An alternative method of spark perforation is described in our UK Patent Publication No. 2079211 in which the paper to be spark perforated is passed between the electrodes of a rotary electrode assembly and a suitably juxtapositioned earthed surface. The rotary assembly has a first set of annular electrodes which are connected to a suitable power source, and a second set of annular electrodes of greater external diameter than the first set which alternate with the first set.A dielectric material spaces the electrodes to form a series of parallel capacitors.The pore diameter achieved by spark perforation is typically from 80 to 200Am, whilst the pore diameter achieved by mechanical perforation is typically 500 im. Example 1A range of sheets of paper of similar grammage 100 t 2 5 gm having different thicknesses, burst strengths and air resistance were made on a laboratory sheet making machine using a furnish made up of different blends of cellulose and Pulpex polyethylene fibres.These sheets were then placed in an oven at a temperature of 130 C to heat bond the synthetic thermoplastic fibres. Plant pouts of conical shape were then formed from the sheets by hand.The pots were filled with a potting compost and two peas were placed in each pot. The seeds were watered in and a daily check and record made of the first signs of germination. As the seedlings progressed, examinations for root penetration were also carried out.Three pots of each type of material were used. All growing was carried out indoors using a technique which allowed a visible assessment of root penetration to be made without complete removal of the growing medium.This involved placing the plant pots with their tops touching in a seed tray and the edges of the tray were covered to allow little or no light to the lower half of the plant pots. Growth was continued for a period of 2 months.The results are shown in Table 1.

In these pots the porosity and burst strength are well within the preferred range. Pot I has also allowed good root penetration despite having a fairly high burst strength. The fairly high burst strength was probably counteracted by the high porosity. Pot J although having similar physical characteristics toPot I has remained potbound, probably due to the presence of fungicide. Pot E has remained potbound although both burst strength and porosity are within the preferred ranges. This was probably because both the porosity and the burst strength are towards the high end of these ranges.Example 2This example illustrates the use of papers of varying grammage in the present invention.Sheets of paper having grammages of 60 5 gm 70 5 gum 2, 80 5 gum 2 and lOO s gm were made on conventional papermaking machinery using a furnish made up of a blend of 64 bleached kraft fibre, 14 unbleached kraft fibre and 22 synthetic wood pulp.These sheets were then heat bonded, formed into plant pots and tested for root penetration as described inExample 1. Additionally the biomass of the germinating seedlings was measured. Biomass is the weight of vegetation above the growing medium and thus provides a quantitative indication of growth.

These sheets were then placed in an oven at a temperature of 130 0C to heat bond the synthetic fibres. The sheets were then spark perforated using the apparatus described in Figures 10 and 26 of our copending UK Patent Publication No. 2079212A at a voltage of 10,000V and a current of 5.5 to 6A.

This is thought to be due to a low porosity and high burst strength. By spark perforating the material a plant pot with improved porosity is obtained allowing root penetration to occur.In both cases the durability of the plant pots i.e. their ability to withstand repeated handling was good.Example 7A range of sheets of paper of similar grammage 2 100 5 gm having different thicknesses, burst strengths and air resistance were made using a furnish of 1 64 bleached kraft 14 unbleached kraft 22 synthetic woodpulp Pulpex E 2 80 unbleached kraft 20 synthetic woodpulp Pulpex E These sheets were then subject to mechanical perfora tion instead of spark perforation.
