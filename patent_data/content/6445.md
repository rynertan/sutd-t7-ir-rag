# Methods of fabricating electrical apparatus comprising one or more heat generating electrical components.

## Abstract
Electrical apparatus is disclosed in which heat from a semi conductor chip 10 is conducted through a piston member 26 to a housing 16 from which the heat is dissipated. The piston has circumferential grooves 40 and registering longitudinal side grooves 42 . The grooves 40 are initially filled with a low melting point, thermally conductive material, such as amber wax. A central bore 33 registering with radial grooves 34 is similarly initially filled with the material. When the assembly is appropriately heated, the material melts and under gravity and capilliary flow fills the interfaces between the end of the piston and the chip and between the side wall of the piston and the cylinder wall. The lower edge of the grooves 40 are slanted to facilitate flow of the material.
