# DEVICE FOR PREVENTING SINKERS FROM PICKING UP YARN IN A DOUBLE CYLINDER CIRCULAR KNITTING MACHINE

## Abstract
To avoid yarn picking up by the sinkers associated with sliders being progressively deactivated while knitting the heel portion of a stocking article, the sliders 1 , at the end thereof far from the needle engaging end, are formed with a notch 10 . This notch is designed to engage the yarn 11 and raise it as the sliders 1 are lifted by the slider lifting pickers upon removal from knitting of the associated needles 9 . The slid ers 1 may be lifted to a position such that the notch 10 is brought above the hook 7 of the respective sinkers 6 which, accordingly, cannot engage with the yarn during the with drawal phase. Thus, the bluff sinkers and related ears on the sliders for lifting the bluff sinkers can be eliminated, and the machine made simpler and less expensive to build, as well as less liable to give trouble from breakage of the ears and bluff sinkers.
