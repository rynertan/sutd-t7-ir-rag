# Index type color picture reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
An index type color picture reproducing circuit includes a phase detector 5 in which the phase difference between an index signal applied at the preset time and an index signal applied at the time earlier substantially by one horizontal scanning period than the former is detected to be converted into an output voltage indicative of the phase difference therebetween. A phase adjustment circuit 9 receives any one of the index signal, chrominance subcarrier signal and chrominance signal, and the phase of the input signal is changed depending on the output voltage of the phase detec tor thereby generating an index type picture tube drive signal, so that a color picture with the normal hue can be reproduced even when a picture signal received has a horizontal scanning frequency different from the standard one.
