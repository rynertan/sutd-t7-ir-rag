# IMPROVEMENTS IN CARDIAC PACER

## Abstract
A cardiac pacer has separate digital filter circuits for sensing atrial and ventricular activity. Parameter data stored in memory is used by the digital filters for identifying the various components of cardiac activity, such as the P, R and T waves, as well as for identifying Premature Ventricular Contractions PVC . A Ventricular Rate Time Out period is established from the last natural beat or stimulating pulse and if a P wave or natural R wave is not sensed during that period, the system generates a stimulating pulse and, using T wave parameters in the ventricular filter, tests to verify capture. Loss of capture increases stimulating pulse width and amplitude to regain capture.
