## Description
Multiple stage hydrocarbon conversion process This invention relates to a method for effecting the catalytic conversion of a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock in a multiple stage conversion system in which a hydrogen hydrocarbon reaction mixture is serially processed through a plurality of reaction zones in contact with a particulate catalyst gravitating downwardly through each of said reaction zones. The method is particularly adapted for use with a vapor phase hydrocarbon conversion process and with hydrocarbon conversion reactions which are primarily endothermic reactions, and wherein the reaction mixture is processed downwardly and in essentially radial flow contact with the downwardly moving catalyst particles. Multiple stage reaction systems such as herein contemplated have found extensive use in the petroleum and petrochemical industries for effecting a variety of hydrocarbon conversion reactions. Said reactions are either exothermic or endothermic and encompass both hydrogen producing and hydrogen consuming reactions. Multiple stage reaction systems usually take one of two forms.Thus, in an endothermic hydrocarbon conversion process, said system may comprise a side byside reactor configuration wherein a reactant stream is processed serially from the reaction zone of one reactor through the reaction zone of another reactor with intermediate heating of the reactant stream between reaction zones or said system may comprise a stacked reactor design wherein a reactant stream is passed serially from a reaction zone of a topmost reactor to a reaction zone of a lowermost reactor, with intermediate heating of the reactant stream. Such systems have been utilized in the petroleum industry to effect numerous hydrocarbon conversion reactions, including catalytic reforming, alkylation and dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene.The method of this invention is particularly useful with respect to an endothermic, vapor phase hydrocarbon conversion process wherein catalyst particles move via gravity flow, and the multiple stage reaction system may comprise side by side reactors, stacked reactors, or a combination thereof. Since catalyst particles which move through a reaction system by gravity flow are necessarily moving in a downward direction, the present method contemplates the withdrawl of catalyst particles from the bottom of one reaction zone and the introduction of said catalyst particles, fresh catalyst particles and or regenerated catalyst particles to the top portion of a reaction zone next in sequence. The present method is particularly intended to be applied to those reaction systems wherein the downwardly moving catalyst particles are disposed as an annular form bed in a reaction zone, and the downward flow of the reactant stream is essentially rad ial flow with respect thereto. A radial flow reaction system generally consists oftubular form sections of varying nominal cross sectional areas, said sections being vertically and coaxially disposed to form the reaction vessel. Briefly, the system consists of an outer tubular reaction chamber containing a coaxially disposed tubular catalyst retaining screen with a nominal internal crosssectional area less than that of sai chamber, and a tubular perforated centerpipe having a nominal internal cross sectional area which is le than that of said catalyst retaining screen. The vapor phase reactant stream is introduced into the outer annular space created by the chamber wall and the catalyst retaining screen, the latter forming an annular form catalyst holding zone with the perforated centerpipe.The reactant stream flows laterally and radially from said outer annular space through the catalyst retaining zone into said centerpipe and out of the reaction chamber. Illustrative of a multiple stage stacked reaction zone system, to which the present invention is particularly adaptable, is that shown in U.S. Patent No, 3,706,536. Transfer of the gravity flowing catalyst particles from one reaction zone to another, as well as introduction of fresh catalyst particles and the withdrawal of spent catalyst particles, is effected through utilization of a plurality of catalyst transfer conduits. Experience in the use of such systems, as well as those where the reaction zones are disposed in a side byside relationship, indicates that the high vapor flow through the annular form catalyst holding sections results in cata lyst particles being pinned in the vicinity of the perforated centerpipe. Stagnant catalyst areas where the catalyst particles are prevented from assuming the gravity flow pattern are thereby created. This invention seeks to alleviate the catalyst pinning problem in a multiple stage hydrocarbon conversion system wherein catalyst particles move via gravity flow, especially one comprising a plurality of reaction zones in each of which catalyst particles are disposed in an annular form bed and move downwardly via gravity flow. According to the invention, a method of effecting the catalytic conversion of a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock in a multiple stage conversion system in which 1 a mixture of hydrogen and the hydrocarbonaceous feedstock is heated and processed serially at hydrocarbon conversion conditions through a plurality of reaction zones containing catalyst particles, 2 the reaction product effluent from each reaction zone except the last is heated prior to introduction into the next succeeding zone, effluent from the last reaction zone being recovered, and 3 catalyst particles move through each reaction zone via gravity flow, catalyst particles being withdrawn at least periodically from the last reaction zone and fresh or regenerated catalyst particles being introduced at least periodically into the first reaction zone, is characterized by a combination of the steps of a initially admixing from 40 to 80 mole percent of the total hydrogen to be used with the hydrocarbonaceous feedstock, prior to introduction into the first reaction zone, and b admixing the balance of the hydrogen with the effluent from the first reaction zone and or from a succeeding reaction zone or zones except the last, prior to introduction into the next succeeding reaction zone. In a more specific embodiment, this invention provides a method for effecting the catalytic reforming of a naphtha boiling range hydrocarbonaceous feedstock in a four stage hydrocarbon conversion system which comprises the steps of a initially admixing from 60 to 70 mole of the total hydrogen charged to the four stage hydrocarbon conversion system with the hydrocarbonaceous feedstock charged thereto, and introducing the heated mixture into the first of four reaction zones each containing catalyst particles moving under gravity flow b heating the effluents from the first, second and third of the four reaction zones, and introducing the heated material into the second, third and fourth of the four reaction zones respectively, the balance of the total hydrogen being admixed with the third reaction zone effluent c recovering the effluent from the fourth reaction zone and passing a portion thereof in heat exchange relationship with the hydrogen and hydrocarbonaceous feedstock mixture prior to heating the latter and introducing it into the first reaction zone d passing another portion of the fourth reaction zone effluent in heat exchange relationship with the balance of the total hydrogen prior to admixture of the latter with the third reaction zone effluent and e at least periodically withdrawing catalyst particles from the fourth reaction zone, and introducing fresh or regenerated catalyst particles into the first reaction zone. In a preferred embodiment, the effluent flow of at least one reaction zone may be restricted by means of a fixed restriction orifice to further reduce catalyst pinning. Therefore, in a multiple stage hydrocarbonaceous feedstock conversion system wherein 1 a recycled hydrogen rich vapor phase is admixed with the feedstock to provide a mixture having a hydrogen hydrocarbon mole ratio of from 0.5 1 to 10 1, 2 the mixture is heated and processed serially through a plurality of reaction zones, 3 each reaction zone effluent is heated prior to introduction into the next succeeding reaction zone, and 4 catalyst particles are movable through an annular form bed in each reaction zone via gravity flow, a preferred embodiment of the present invention is a method for effecting the conversion of said feedstock which comprises the steps of a initially introducing from 40 to 80 mole of the total hydrogen into the first reaction zone of the plurality of reaction zones by admixing only a sufficient portion of the hydrogen rich vapor phase with the feedstock, heating, and introducing the heated mixture into said first reaction zone at hydrocarbon conversion conditions b introducing the balance of the total hydrogen into a subsequent reaction zone by admixing the remaining portion of said recycled hydrogen rich vapor phase with the first reaction zone effluent, or with the effluent of an intermediate reaction zone, heating, and introducing the heated mixture into the next succeeding reaction zone at hydrocarbon conversion con ditions c restricting the effluent flow of at least one reaction zone by means of a fixed restriction orifice, and separating the last reaction zone effluent into a normally liquid product phase and a hydrogen rich vapor phase d recovering at least a portion of said hydrogen rich vapor phase, and recycling said portion to the first reaction zone in accordance with step a e recovering another portion of said hydrogen rich vapor phase for recycle to the next succeeding reaction zone in accordance with step b f at least periodically withdrawing catalyst from the last of said reaction zones and, g at least periodically introducing fresh or regenerated catalyst into the first of said reaction zones. Preferably, at least a major portion of the last reaction zone effluent is passed in heat exchange relationship with the mixture of hydrocarbonaceous feedstock and a part of the total hydrogen prior to the heating and introduction of said mixture into the first reaction zone in accordance with step a , and or at least a minor portion of the last reaction zone effluent is passed in heat exchange relationship with the balance of the total hydrogen prior to admixture of the latter with a reaction zone effluent in accordance with step b . Suitably, each of the aforesaid flow restrictions, including the recycled hydrogen rich vapor phase flow restriction if present, effects an increase in the pressure drop across the plurality of reaction zones of from 0.07 to 0.7 kg cm2 1 to 10 psi . The multiple stage reaction system may for example comprise four reaction zones disposed as a vertical stack having a common vertical axis, the catalyst particles being movable from one reaction zone to the next lower reaction zone in the stack via gravity flow. U.S. Patent No. 4,119,526 is illustrative of a multiple stage hydrocarbon conversion system comprising a plurality of reaction zones such as herein contemplated. The invention patented there is directed to a solution of the catalyst pinning problem which is the focus of the present invention. As with the present invention, a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock and hydrogen mixture is processed serially through a plurality of reaction zones in each of which catalyst particles move downwardly via gravity flow. The catalyst pinning problem is dealt with by restricting the effluent of at least one reaction zone, and also the flow of the hydrogen rich vapor phase separated from the last reaction zone effluent and recycled to the first reaction zone.The resulting increased density of te reaction zone feed, and the pressure drop within the entire reactor circuit, serve to alleviate the catalyst pinning problem. The method of the present invention is used in hydrocarbon conversion systems which are characterized as multiple stage, and in which catalyst particles move via gravity flow through each reaction zone. Furthermore, the present invention is principally intended for utilization in reactor systems where the principal reactions are endothermic and are effected in the vapor phase. Although the following discussion is specifically directed toward catalytic reforming of naphtha boiling range fractions, there is no intent to so limit the present invention. Catalytic reforming, as well as many other processes, has experienced several phases of development currently terminating in the system in which the catalyst beds assume the form of a descending column in one or more reaction vessels.Typically, the catalysts are utilized in substantially spherical form having a nominal diameter ranging from 0.8 to 4 mm 1 32 to 5 32 inch in order to offer free flow characteristics which will neither bridge nor block the descending column or columns of catalyst within the overall system. In one such multiple stage system, the reaction chambers are vertically stacked, and a plurality, generally from 6 to 16, of relatively small diameter conduits are employed to transfer catalyst particles from one reaction zone to the next lower reaction zone via gravity flow, the catalyst particles being ultimately withdrawn from the last reaction zone. The latter particles are usually transported to the top of a catalyst regeneration facility also functioning with a descending column of catalyst particles. Regenerated catalyst particles are then transported to the top of the upper reaction zone of the stack. In order to facilitate and enhance gravity flow within each reaction vessel, as well as from one zone to another, it is particularly important that the catalyst particles have a relatively small nominal diameter, and one which is preferably less than about 4 mm 5 32 inch .In a conversion system having the individual gravity flow reaction zones in side by side relationship, catalyst transport vessels such as those of the type shown in U.S. Patent No. 3,839,197 may be employed in transferring the particles from the bottom of one zone to the top of the succeeding zone, and from the last reaction zone to the top of the regeneration facility. Catalytic reforming of naphtha boiling range hydrocarbons, a vapor phase operation, is effected at hydrocarbon conversion conditions generally including catalyst bed temperatures in the range of 3700 to 5500C 7000 to 10200F . Judicious and cautious techniques generally dictate that catalyst temperatures do not substantially exceed a level of 5500C 10200F .Other conditions generally include a pressure of from 4.5 to 2 70 kg cm2 50 to 1000 psig , a liquid hourly space velocity defined as volumes of fresh charge stock per hour, per volume of total catalyst particles in the range of 0.2 to 10 and a hydrogen to hydrocarbon mole ratio generally in the range of 0.5 1 to 10 1. As those skilled in the petroleum refining arts are aware, the described continuous regenerative reforming system offers numerous advantages when compared to the prior art fixed bed systems. Among these is the capability of efficient operation at compartively lower 2 pressures e.g. 4.5 to 15 kg cm 50 to 200 psig and higher liquid hourly space velocities e.g. 3 to 8.As a result of continuous catalyst regeneration, higher consistent inlet catalyst bed temperatures can be maintained e.g. 510 to 5400C 9500 to 10100F . Furthermore, there is afforded a corresponding increase in both hydrogen production and hydrogen purity in the recycled vaporous phase from the product separation facility. Catalytic reforming reactions are varied, and include dehydrogenation of naphthenes to aromatics, dehydrocyclization of paraffins to aromatics, hydrocracking of long chain paraffins into lower boiling, normally liquid materials and, to a certain extent, the isomerization of paraffins.These reactions, the net result of which is endothermicity with respect to the overall reaction system, may be effected through the utilization of one or more Group VIII noble metals e.g. platinum, iridium, rhodium, palladium combined with a halogen e.g. chlorine and or fluorine and a porous carrier material such as alumina. Relatively recent investigations have indicated that more advantageous results are attainable and enjoyed through the cojoint use of a catalytic modifier these have been selected from the group of cobalt, nickel, gallium, germanium, tin, rhenium, vanadium and mixtures thereof. Regardless of the selected catalytic composite, the ability to attain the advantage over the common fixed bed systems is greatly dependent upon achieving acceptable catalyst particle flow downwardly through the system. Not only must this be substantially uniform throughout the cross section of the annular catalyst bed, but stagnant areas of catalyst must be maintained at the most achievable minimum. Catalytic reforming is a well known process which has been thoroughly described in the literature, having been a commercially important tool of the petroleum refining industry for about three decades. One of the many things gleaned from the vast amount of catalytic reforming experience and resulting knowledge is the soundness of utilizing multiple stages, each of which contains a different quantity of catalyst, generally expressed as volume percent. The reactant stream, hydrogen and the hydrocarbon feed, flow serially through the reaction zones in order of increasing catalyst volume with, of course, interstage heating. In a threereaction zone system, typical catalyst loadings are first, from 10 to 30 second, from 20 to 40 and third, from 40 to 60 .With respect to a four reaction zone system, suitable loadings would be first, 5 to 15 second, 15 to 25 third, 25 to 35 and fourth, 35 to 50 . Unequal catalyst distribution, increasing in the serial direction of reactant stream flow, facilitates and enhances the distribution of the reactants as well as the overall heating of the reactants. As hereinbefore stated, the pinning of catalyst particles to the perforated centerpipe stems primarily from the high vapor velocity laterally across the annular form catalyst holding zone, this adverse effect increasing in degree as the cross sectional area and length of the catalyst bed decreases.In multiple stage catalytic reforming systems, therefore, the effect is most pronounced in the first and second reaction zones, having the smaller annular cross sectional areas, somewhat less in the third reaction zone and of a relatively minor consequence in the fourth reaction zone due to its length and lager cross sectional catalyst area.By the device of diverting a portion of the hydrogen rich vapor phase normally recycled to the first reaction zone, and recycling said diverted portion to a subsequent reaction zone, the flow rate of the vapor phase reaction mixture across the annular form catalyst holding zone therein is reduced to the point where the tendency of the catalyst particles to become pinned is substantially obviated. While the hydrogen rich vaporous phase diverted around the first reaction zone may be recycled to any of the subsequent reaction zones, it is a preferred practice to recycle the diverted material to the last reaction zone to alleviate the coking tendency of said zone wherein catalyst coking is most pronounced.As heretofore mentioned, the hydrogen hydrocarbon mole ratio of the hydrogen hydrocarbonaceous feedstock mixture charged to the first reaction zone is generally in the range of from 0.5 1 to 10 1. Often, a hydrogen hydrocarbon mole ratio of from 3 1 to 6 1 is preferred particularly in a multiple stage catalytic reforming system. In any case, from 40 to 80 mole percent of said hydrogen is admixed with the hydrocarbonaceous feedstock charged to the first reaction zone, the balance being charged to a subsequent reaction zone preferably the last reaction zone. More preferably, from 60 to 70 mole percent of said hydrogen is admixed with the hydrocarbonaceous feedstock and charged to the first reaction zone. Catalyst pinning is in large part a function of two dependent variables 1 the vapor mass flow rate, and 2 the density of the vapors which flow through the annularform catalyst bed into and through the perforated centerpipe.To reduce or eliminate catalyst pinning, for a given design flow of fresh feedstock, the rate at which the hydrogenrich vapor phase is recycled to the system must be reduced.This will, however, reduce the total mass flow to a given reaction zone, and this in turn reduces the reactor system pressure drop. Of course, the effective pressure in the initial reactor, in which catalyst pinning is most prevalent and troublesome, is reduced, and a corresponding reduction in vapor density ensues. In bypassing the initial reaction zone and diverting a portion of the hydrogen rich recycle gas to a subsequent reaction zone in series therewith as herein contemplated, the pressure drop across the plurality of reaction zones is increased, and the reaction zone or zones preceding said subsequent reaction zone experience a pressure increase and a corresponding increase in vapor density to substantially alleviate the catalyst pinning problem therein. The catalyst pinning problem can be further alleviated by restricting the effluent flow from the last reaction zone and or one or more earlier reaction zones. Preferably, the effluent flow from all reaction zones is restricted, either prior to introduction into the next succeeding reaction zone or, with respect to the last reaction zone, prior to separation of the effluent flow into the normally liquid product and hydrogen rich vapor phase. With respect to the intermediate reaction zones of a four reaction zone system, it is preferred to restrict the effluent flow of said inter mediate zones in addition to that of the last reaction zone, with or without restriction of the first reaction zone effluent flow. Restriction of the various reaction zone effluent streams can be effected in any suitable manner. Desirably, it should produce or result in an additional overall pressure drop across the plurality of reaction zones of from 0.07 to 0.7 kg cm2 1 to 10 psi for each restriction. The use of the restriction orifices is a contributing factor to an increased pressure in the initial reaction zone, a corresponding increase in the vapor density therein, and a corresponding increase in the pressure drop across the plurality of reaction zones. Use of the restriction orifices also affords a greater recycle gas flow conducive to a reduced deposition of carbonaceous matter on the catalyst particles and a reduced load on the regeneration facility.In this respect, recycling of the diverted hydrogen rich recycle gas through the last intermediate charge heater to the lowermost reaction zone helps to alleviate the erring tendency of said reaction zone wherein the bulk of the catalyst coking typically occurs. Preferably, the restriction orifices are placed upstream of the intermediate reaction zone heaters to decrease the heater operating pressure and increase the velocity of the reaction zone effluent in the heater tubes. Similarly, it is a common practice to heat exchange the hydrogen hydrocarbon reaction mixture against the hot last reaction zone effluent prior to introduction of the mixture into the first reaction zone. In accordance with the preferred mode of effecting the present invention, the hydrogen rich recycle gas is restricted prior to the heat exchanger. While the restriction of said recycle gas does not necessarily contribute to the solution of the catalyst pinning problem, at least to as great an extent as the reaction zone effluent restriction, it does serve to ensure a proper distribution of the hydrogen rich recycle gas to the heat exchanger, which generally consists of two parallel shells of exchange. In effect, the restriction orifices reinstate the pressure drop lost while operating at the lower and more desirable hydrogen hydrocarbon mole ratios and lower reaction zone pressures. In further description of the present invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which are presented solely for purpose of illustration and are not intended as a limitation on the scope of the invention as set out in the claims. Therefore, miscellaneous appurtenances well within the purview of those skilled in the art and not required for a complete understanding of the invention have been eliminated or reduced in number. Figures 1 and 2 of the drawings are simplified schematic flow diagrams showing alternative embodiments of a 4 reaction zone catalyst reforming system having an uppermost or first reaction zone I, two intermediate reaction zones II and III, and a lowermost or fourth reaction zone IV. Referring to Figure 1 of the drawings, a stacked, gravity flow, catalytic reaction system is shown as having four individual reaction zones which are sized as to length and annular catalyst cross sectional area such that the distribution of the total catalyst volume is 10 in zone I, 15 in zone II, 25 in zone III, and 50 in zone IV. In a normal, substantially problem free operation, fresh or regenerated catalyst particles are introduced through conduit 28 and inlet port 29 into the uppermost reaction zone I, and said particles gravitate downwardly into reaction zone II, from reaction zone II to reaction zone III, and from reaction zone IIIto reaction zone IV, said particles being ultimately withdrawn from the reactor system through a plurality of outlet ports 30 and conduits 31.Catalyst particles thus recovered may be transported to a continuous regeneration zone, not shown, or may be stored until a sufficient quantity is available for a batch type regeneration. The rate of catalyst flow through the reactor system, or the period of time required for catalyst particles to be introduced into the system, to traverse the four reaction zones, and to be withdrawn for regeneration, is determined by the rate at which the latter is effected. By monitoring various operating parameters while the system is in continuous operation, the catalyst withdrawal rate, or regeneration load, can be controlled. In use of the system in a preferred embodiment a naphtha boiling range hydrocarbon feedstock is admitted by way of line 1 and admixed with one portion of a hydrogenrich vapor phase recovered from a separator 25 through line 2 as hereinafter related. The hydrocarbon feedstock is admixed with said hydrogen rich vapor phase to provide a reaction mixture having a hydrogen hydrocarbon mole ratio of about 3 1, and said mixture is continued through line 2 to a heat exchanger 3 wherein the mixture is preheated by indirect heat exchange with the bulk of the hot reaction mixture effluent recovered from the lowermost reaction zone IV through line 20. A second portion of said hydrogen rich vapor phase recovered from said separator 25 is diverted from line 2 through line 4 and a flow control valve 5 and passed to a second heat exchanger 6 wherein said diverted hydrogen rich vapor phase is preheated by indirect heat exchange with another portion of said hot reaction mixture effluent recovered from the lowermost reaction zone IV via line 20.This last mentioned preheated hydrogen rich vaporous phase is recovered from the heat exchanger 6 through line 7 and recycled to the lowermost reaction zone IV as hereinafter described. The hydrogen hydrocarbon reaction mixture preheated in heat exchanger 3 exits from the heat exchanger by way of line 8 and enters a charge heater 9 wherein the mixture is heated to provide a desired inlet temperature to the catalyst bed disposed in the uppermost reaction zone I. The heated mixture is recovered from said charge heater 9 and charged to said reaction zone through line 10. The hydrogen hydrocarbon reaction mixture is processed downwardly through said uppermost reaction zone I, and the effluent from said reaction zone is recovered and transferred to a first intermediate charge heater 12 by way of line 11. The effluent stream is thus reheated to provide a desired inlet temperature to the next catalyst bed disposed in the first intermediate reaction zone II, the reheated effluent stream being charged to said reaction zone by way of line 13.The hydrogen hydrocarbon reaction mixture is continued downwardly through said reaction zone II, and the reaction zone effluent is recovered through line 14, reheated in a second intermediate charge heater 15, and charged to a second intermediate reaction zoneIII through line 16 to provide a desired inlet temperature to the catalyst bed disposed therein.The reaction zone III effluent stream is withdrawn through line 17 and admixed with the aforementioned preheated hydrogen rich vaporous phase recycled through line 7 to provide a reaction mixture having a hydrogen hydrocarbon mole ratio of about 4.5 1. The hydrogen enriched reaction mixture is then continued through line 17 to a third and last intermediate charge heater 18 wherein the mixture is reheated to provide a desired inlet temperature to the catalyst bed disposed in the lowermost reaction zoneIV. The reheated mixture is transferred from the lastmentioned heater to said reaction zone IV by way of line 19. The hot reaction mixture effluent stream from the lowermost reaction zone IV is recovered through line 20 and utilized as a heat exchange medium in the heat exchangers 3 and 6. The hot effluent stream is distributed to heat exchanger 6 through line 20, and to heat exchanger 3 through line 20 and line 21. The reaction mixture effluent thus cooled is recovered from heat exchanger 3 by way of line 22, and from heat exchanger 6 by way of line 23, the heat exchanger effluent streams being combined in line 23 and passed through a condenser 24 wherein further cooling and condensation is effected at a temperature of from 15 to 6GOC 600 to 1400F . The mixture is continued through line 23 to a separator 25.A hydrogen rich vapor phase is withdrawn from the separator 25 through line 2, and excess hydrogen is discharged from the process through line 26 at a rate determined by pressure control means not shown. The balance of the hydrogen rich vapor phase is continued through line 2 for recycle to the uppermost reaction zone I in admixture with the hydrocarbon feedstock, and for recycle to the lowermost reaction zone IV, all in accordance with the foregoing process description. A normally liquid phase portion of the reaction mixture is withdrawn from the separator 25 through line 27 and treated in conventional fractionation facilities which are not shown. By diverting a portion of the hydrogen rich recycle gas to the lowermost reaction zone, a portion which would normally be included in the hydrogen rich recycle gas charged to the uppermost reaction zone, the flow rate of the vapor phase reaction mixture to and through the initial reaction zones is reduced to the point where the tendency of the catalyst particles to become pinned therein is substantially obviated.Further, by preheating and injecting the diverted hydrogenrich recycle gas into the last intermediate charge heater, the load on said heater is appreciably reduced, and the improved thermal conductivity of the lowermost reaction zone effluent enhances the heat exchange capacity of the downstream heat exchangers. And still further, recycling of the diverted hydrogen rich recycle gas through the last intermediate charge heater to the lowermost reaction zone helps to alleviate the coking tendency of said reaction zone wherein the bulk of the catalyst coking typically occurs. Figure 2 shows the same flow scheme as Figure 1 with the addition of restriction orifices 32, 33, 34, 35 and 36. In the embodiment shown in Figure 2, a naphtha boiling range hydrocarbon feedstock is admitted to the process by way of line 1 and admixed with a hydrogen rich vapor phase being recycled through line 2 from a separator 25, said hydrogenrich vapor phase being recycled through a restriction orifice 32 rated at about 0.42 kg cm2 6 psi and contained in line 2. The hydrocarbon feedstock is admixed with said hydrogen rich vapor phase to provide a reaction mixture suitably having a hydrogen hydrocarbon mole ratio of about 3 1, and said mixture is continued through line 2 to a heat exchanger 3 wherein the mixture is preheated by indirect heat exchange with the bulk of the hot reaction mixture effluent recovered from the lowermost reaction zone IV through line 20 and transferred to the heat exchanger 3 via line 21. A second portion of said hydrogen rich vapor phase being recycled from said separator 25 is diverted from line 2 at a point upstream of said restriction orifice 32 and transferred through line 4 and a flow control valve 5 to a second heat exchanger 6 wherein the diverted hydrogen rich vapor phase is preheated in indirect heat exchange with a portion of said hot reaction mixture effluent recovered from the lowermost reaction zone IV via line 20. This last mentioned preheated hydrogen rich vapor phase is recovered from the h eat exchanger 6 through line 7 and recycled to the lowermost reaction zone It as hereinafter described. The hydrogen hydrocarbon reaction mixture preheated in heat exchanger 3 exits through line 8 and enters a charge heater 9 wherein the mixture is heated to provide a desired inlet temperature to the annular form catalyst bed disposed in the uppermost reaction zone I. The resulting vapor phase reaction mixture is recovered from the charge heater 9 and charged to said reaction zone I through line 10. The reaction mixture is processed downwardly through said uppermost reaction zone I, and the effluent from said reaction zone is recovered through line 11 containing a restriction 2 orifice 33 rated at about 0.35 kg cm2 5 psi . Said effluent is continued through line 11 to a first intermediate charge heater 12.The effluent stream is thus reheated to provide a desired inlet temperature to the next annular form catalyst bed disposed in the first intermediate reaction zone II, the reheated effluent stream being charged to said reaction zone by way of line 13. The hydrogen hydrocarbon reaction mixture is continued downwardly through reaction zone II, and the reaction zone effluent is recovered through a restriction orifice 34 in line 14, reheated in a second intermediate charge heater 15, and charged to a second intermediate reaction zone III through line 16 to provide a desired inlet temperature to the annular form catalyst bed disposed therein.The last mentioned restriction orifice is rated at about 2 0.42 kg cm 6 psi . The reaction zone III effluent stream is withdrawn through line 17 containing a restriction orifice 35 rated 2 at about 0.42 kg cm 6 psi and located upstream of the juncture of line 7 with line 17. At said juncture, the afore mentioned preheated hydrogen rich vapor phase recycled through line 7 is admixed with the reaction zone III effluent stream passing through line 17, suitably to provide a reaction mixture therein having a hydrogen hydrocarbon mole ratio of about 4.5 1. This hydrogen enriched reaction mixture is continued through line 17 to a third and last intermediate charge heater 18 wherein the mixture is reheated to provide a desired inlet temperature to the annularform catalyst bed disposed in the lowermost reaction zoneIV. The reheated mixture is transferred from the last mentioned heater to said reaction zone IV by way of line 19. The hot reaction mixture effluent stream from the lowermost reaction zone IV is recovered through line 20 and a 2 restriction orifice 36 rated at about 0.42 kg cm2 6 psi . The hot effluent stream is continued through line 20 and utilized as a heat exchange medium in the heat exchangers 3 and 6. A major portion of the hot effluent stream is diverted from line 20 through line 21 to heat exchanger 3, while a minor portion continues through line 20 to heat exchanger 6. The reaction mixture thus cooled is recovered from heat exchanger 3 through line 22, and from heat exchanger 6 through line 23, the heat exchanger effluent streams being combined in line 23 and passed through a condenser 24 wherein further cooling and condensation is effected at a temperature of from 15 to 600C 600 to 1400F . The mixture is continued through line 23 to a separator 25. A hydrogenrich vapor phase is withdrawn from the separator 25 through an overhead line 2, and excess hydrogen is recovered through line 26 at a rate determined by a pressure control means not shown. The balance of the hydrogen rich vapor phase is continued through line 2, with one portion being diverted through line 5 at a point upstream of the restriction orifice 3 for recycle to the lowermost reaction zone IV, and the remainder being continued through line 2 and said restriction orifice 3 for recycle to the uppermost reaction zoneI, all in accordance with the foregoing process description.A normally liquid product phase of the reaction mixture is recovered from the separator 25 through line 27 and treated in conventional fractionation facilities which are not shown. To reiterate briefly, by diverting a portion of the hydrogen rich recycle gas to the lowermost reaction zone, a portion which would normally be included in the hydrogenrich recycle gas charged to the uppermost reaction zone, the flow rate of the vapor phase reaction mixture to and through the initial reaction zones is reduced, the initial reaction zone experience a pressure increase and a corresponding increase. in vapor pressure, and the pressure drop across the plurality of reaction zones is increased. This desirable combination of effects is the further result of the restriction orifices in the effluent flow of the various reaction zones. The end result is that the tendency of the catalyst particles to become pinned in the initial reaction zones is Eubstantially obviated.
