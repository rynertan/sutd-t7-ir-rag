# Fluidic control device.

## Abstract
A fluidic control device, in particular a vortex amplifier, comprises a casing 10,12 having fluid inlet 14 , outlet 15 and control ports 19 . A vortex chamber 21 is formed within the casing by a plate 16 which is spaced from a wall of the casing by members 17 which each define a part of the periphery of the vortex chamber. Each member has a channel 18 in communication with a respective control port for introducing control fluid flow into the vortex chamber. An aperture 22 is formed in the plate 16 adjacent each channel to divert a portion of the control flow to the opposite side of the plate and facing the inlet port whereby to reduce instability over the operating range of the amplifier.
