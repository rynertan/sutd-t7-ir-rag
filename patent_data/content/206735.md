# COATING WEIGHT AND THICKNESS GAUGES

## Abstract
An apparatus for measuring the weight, thickness or com position of a coating or coatings applied to a substrate includes a primary radiation source 11 , a detector means 10 , and means 6 for processing radiation reflected by the coating or coatings. The source of primary radiation delivers an output which is applied to the coating or coatings and the detector means 10 receives the reflected secondary radiation, the detector means 10 including at least two energy sensitive or energy dependent detectors comprising ionisation chambers 12, 13 fitted with energy sensitive radiation filters 14, 15 able to differentiate between different elements of the coating or coatings from one another, the outputs of the chambers 12, 13 being processed by the processing means to provide an indication of the weight or thickness of the or each coating irrespective of composition, or of the composition of the coating or coatings. The filters 14, 15 are preferably ab sorption edge filters and the source of primary radiation 11 may be either an X ray generator or a radio isotope producing Gamma radiation. The absorption of the radiation filters 14, 15 fitted to the ionisation chambers 12, 13 is selected so as to pass the reflected secondary radiation in accordance with the materials being subjected to the primary radiation from the source 11 .
