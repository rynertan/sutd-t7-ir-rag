# A convolution arithmetic circuit.

## Abstract
A convolution arithmetic circuit according to this invention is equipped with accumulator means that multiplies two digi tal data sequences and then adds up respective results thus multiplied a first memory that stores the coefficient data sequence, and a second memory that stores the multiplicand data sequence, that are supplied to the accumulator means a first count means connected to the first memory a second count means connected to the first memory means for gen erating a control signal that temporarily alters the output from the second count means means for generating a signal that specifies the operating mode of the second memory and means for introducing, to the second memory and the ac cumulator means, the multiplicand data constituted by input signals supplied from an external device when this second memory is in a write mode whereby the first count means performs an address operation for the sequential reading of the coefficient data stored in the first memory and the second count means performs an address operation for the second memory to read the stored multiplicand data from or to write the input signal in the second memory so that the convolution operation can be performed on the digital signals in real time.
