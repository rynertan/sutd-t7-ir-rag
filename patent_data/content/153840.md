## Abstract
A stabilisation system for hover vehicles, for example free flying or cable controlled helicopters or ducted fan vehicles 50 . The system includes at least one downwardly directed sensor which generates a signal representing the distance from the ground of a predetermined location on the vehicle. The signal from one or more sensors 155, 56 is used to control the height of the vehicle above the ground. Signals from a pair of sensors are used to control the attitude of the vehicle relative to the ground.
