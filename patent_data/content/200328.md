# A package for spreadable products.

## Abstract
A package for an individual service portion of a spread able product 15 , such as a butter pat or the like, has two opposed edges 14,14a on each of the base 12 and cover 16 folded into a channel shape and the respective channel sides of the base 14,14a and cover 18,18a are positioned in overlapping abutting contact with two opposed sides of the pat to thereby encase the pat in an open ended, generally rectangularly shaped tubular member 10 . Alternative struc tures include forming the cover 22,32 from a deadfold foil and tamping the ends 22b,32b against the ends of the pat and the bottom 13 of the base channel member to form a completely enclosed package 20 without sealing. Also alternatively, the sides 44,44a 54,54a 64,64a of the bottom channel may extend the full height of the pat and the top cover 15, 55, 65 may be a flat sheet or may be channel shaped perpendicular to that of the base member so as to abut the ends of the pat and form a package 50,60 essentially completely enclosing the pat. Where the ends of the cover 32b,55b are abutted against the pat and bottom of the base channel 12,52 they may be peelably glued to the base to sealingly enclose the pat. Opening means are provided to enable the sealed top to be grasped for removal.
