# APPARATUS FOR THE REACTION MOULDING OF PLASTICS MATERIALS

## Abstract
Apparatus for use in the reaction moulding of plastics materials in which two liquid components are mixed in a screw type or similar mixer 2 3. Mixed material is ejected or poured into the mould not shown via a passageway 16 which latter is one of a plurality of similar passageways 16 arranged radially around a wheel 12. Each passageway 16 remains in the lower most pouring position for a period of time during which it is reckoned to remain in a satisfactory working condition, and the wheel 12 is then automatically indexed to bring the next pas sageway 16 into operation. Cleaning means not shown are employed to clean out the used passageways after a period of time known by experience to be sufficient for the material to be at least partially cured. By this means the passageways can be re used in a continuous production machine. The length of time that each passageway 16 remains in the pouring position is found from experience of the particular materials being used it is found in practice that the passageway remains in a satis factory working condition for about 60 seconds.
