# Process for the preparation of beta lactam derivatives, the novel derivatives so obtainable and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of β lactam derivatives having a substituted hydroxymethyl group at the carbon atom α to the lactam carbonyl group, to the novel antibacterially active derivatives so obtainable and to pharmaceutical compositions containing these. The process comprises reacting under specified conditions an α halo β lactam starting material with activated zinc in the presence of an appropriate aldehyde or ketone and hydrolysing the resulting zinc complex. The novel β lactam derivatives are of the general formula I
