# A machine for solid phase polymerization.

## Abstract
A machine for solid phase polymerization comprises a system for supplying 100 particles of a synthetic polymer a reaction system 200 for effecting solid phase polymerization of the particles fed from the supplying system 100 under a vacuum and heated condition and a system for discharging 300 the solid phase polymerized particles. The supplying system 100 includes a pre treatment apparatus comprising a pre crystallizer 101 of a vertical agitator type and a beater 112 of a horizontal type. The reaction system 200 includes a horizontal reaction vessel 201 having a horizontal rotary shaft 207 , with a helically formed screw vane 203 . The screw vane has a multiplicity of small through apertures, and scrapers are axially extending between adjacent screw vane portions. Intermediate pots 206, 321 having specially designed vacuum breakers 211, 212, 326, 327 are disposed at locations between the reaction system 200 and the supply ing system 100 and between the reaction system 200 and the discharging system 300 .
