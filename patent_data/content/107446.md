# An improved multiple leg multichannel magnetic transducer structure and method of manufacturing.

## Abstract
In a multichannel transducer each channel has two assem bled corresponding magnetic core portions 10, 13 , each por tion having an intermediate 28, 54 and a rear leg portion 15, 16 respectively. Both core portions are contiguous with a magnetic pole and each provides a distinct flux path. The rear leg portion extends at an acute angle to the intermediate leg portion and it converges towards the transducing gap plane. A recording coil 112, 114 is placed on the intermediate leg por tion. The angle of the rear leg portion is selected such that sufficient clearance is provided from the intermediate leg por tion to allow winding the reproducing coil 17, 18 directly around the rear leg portion. Interchannel crosstalk is reduced and mechanical damage to the reproducing coil is eliminated.
