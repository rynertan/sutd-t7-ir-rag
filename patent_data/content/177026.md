# Cassette loading device and method.

## Abstract
A cassette loading device comprises a motor rotatable in a normal direction and in a reverse direction, a driving mechanism for transmitting a power of the motor to a cassette holder and moving the cassette holder, elastic means mounted on the driving mechanism for generating an elastic force against a depression of a tape cassette when the tape cassette is depressed from an initial position to a cassette in position, position detecting device for detecting that the cassette holder reaches a predetermined position in its moving path and for generating a signal, initial position detecting device for detecting an initial position of the elastic means upon initializing and for generating a signal, an eject signal generating device for generating a signal comman ding a cassette unloading and a micro processor for controll ing the motor in response to the signals from the position detecting device, the initial position detecting device and the eject signal generating device. The tape cassette is forcibly unloaded irrespective of the elastic force of the elastic means.
