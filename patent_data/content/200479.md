## Description
This invention relates to phenolic resins and more particularly is concerned with phenol resorcinol formaldehyde resins for use in forming fast curing wood laminating adhesives. Phenolic resin adhesives are well known for their strength and durability and are commonly prepared by the alkaline condensation of formaldehyde with phenol or resorcinol or a mixture of the two. It has been common practice to use ammonia and or amines as alkaline condensation catalysts. Resorcinol formaldehyde resin adhesives, which cure at room temperature under neutral pH conditions, have been widely used in the manufacture of laminated timbers, roof trusses, boat structures and other wood products. United States Patent No. 3929695 relates to a method of preparing a rapidly curable and highly extendable phenolic resin adhesive which consists of adding a resorcinol, a formaldehyde and an alkali metal carbonate to a water soluble thermosetting phenolic resin. Resorcinol is the only polyhydric phenol used to any significant extent directly in the preparation of phenolic resin adhesives and, in general, only those phenolic resins containing resorcinol are commercially important for adhesive applications requiring room temperature setting or curing. The resorcinol containing resin adhesives also have the advantage of being waterproof and durable. Because of its cost, however, the use of resorcinol has been restricted and, as a compromise between cost and performance, resorcinol modified phenol formaldehyde resin adhesive have been developed. Conventionally, the preparation of a resorcinol modified phenol formaldehyde resin adhesive involves the steps of forming a solution of a water soluble, fusible phenol resorcinol formaldehyde resin and making an adhesive mix therefrom by adding to the resin solution a methylene donor which cures the resin to a cross linked, insoluble, infusible state. Commonly used methylene donors, or hardeners, are aqueous formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde, hexamethylenetetramine and the like. In addition to such hardeners, the adhesive mix generally also contains fillers, i.e. inert materials added to increase the weight of the mix, and extenders, i.e. inert materials which lessen the cost without reducing the valuable properties of the adhesive. Commonly used extenders include walnut shell flour, wood flour, bark flour, asbestos and cellulosic fibres. The curing time of a particular adhesive mix can often be adjusted with a catalyst or modifier, and alkali metal hydroxides have been used to speed the cure for water proof adhesives in wood laminating. However, the degree to which cure time can be reduced by the use of alkali metal hydroxides is limited as there is a point whereat the metal hydroxides solubilize the cured adhesives and the bond is no longer waterproof. According to the present invention there is provided a method for making a fusible phenol resorcinol formaldehyde resin solution, which resin solution comprises not more than 95 moles phenol and not less than 5 moles resorcinol per 100 moles of total phenol and resorcinol and from 0.55 to 0.75 moles of formaldehyde for each mole total of phenol and resorcinol, characterised in that said resin solution is prepared by the steps of According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a fast curing phenol resorcinol formaldehyde resin composition which resin comprises the condensation product of 50 to 95 moles phenol and 5 to 50 moles of resorcinol per 100 moles of total phenol and resorcinol and 0.55 to 0.75 moles of formaldehyde for each mole of combined phenol and resorcinol, characterised in that it additionally contains from 4 to 8 percent by weight of the resin of an alkali metal carbonate. We have found A thixotropic resin may be obtained by adding to the resin solution, for example, 2 parts or more by weight of fumed silica per 100 parts of resin solution, using high shear mixing equipment such as a SOLONATOR . The general procedure for preparing the novel resin solutions of the invention is as follows. Formaldehyde usually as a 37 percent aqueous solution is mixed with the alkali metal sulphite or bisulphite catalyst and the mixture is heated to dissolve the catalyst. For ease of operation, this is conveniently done before the addition of the phenol, although the phenol can be added initially before dissolving the catalyst. The phenol is charged to the reaction mixture with the pH of the mixture being maintained between 8.5 and 9.2. The reaction mixture is then refluxed until a viscosity in the range of U V Gardner letters is obtained. The extent of condensation is conveniently determined by following the viscosity during condensation. The advancement of the condensation between the phenol and formaldehyde to a stage corresponding to a viscosity of U V Gardner letters is necessary in order to obtain the unique properties of the resin solutions and resin adhesives of the invention. This high degree of condensation, which is unique in the preparation of phenol resorcinol formaldehyde resins, effectively ties up the available phenol, thereby avoiding the odour problems that have plagued the art. The high degree of phenol condensation prior to the resorcinol addition provides an extremely reactive resin which can be formulated into an adhesive having a long pot life as well as rapid curing characteristics. As noted above, the advancement of the phenol formaldehyde condensation is made possible by the use of the sulphite catalyst. It is important, for the purposes of the present invention, to complete the advancement of the phenol formaldehyde portion of the condensation to the above indicated viscosity before all of the resorcinol is added. It is convenient to condense the phenol and formaldehyde until the critical viscosity of U V Gardner letters is reached and thereafter add the resorcinol, but excellent resins can also be made by adding the resorcinol continuously or incrementally after the phenol formaldehyde condensation has been advanced to a viscosity of 1.25 poises 0.125 Pa.s . Using the continuous or incremental addition procedure at least the last 25 weight percent of the resorcinol should be added after a viscosity of U Gardner letter has been attained. Using the incremental technique, resorcinol is conveniently added in three or four increments. After the addition of resorcinol is complete, refluxing is continued until the reaction mixture reaches a constant viscosity which is in the range of 30 100 poises 3 10 Pa.s . The viscosity of the resin solution thus prepared is extremely high compared to the normal glue viscosity of adhesive mixes. To make a resin solution useful in adhesive formulations, the resin, prepared as described hereabove, is diluted with water, or with any water miscible solvent conventional in the adhesive art. Particularly useful are mixed solvents comprising two or more of water, lower aliphatic alcohols and glycols. One useful solvent solution is a mixture of ethylene glycol, ethyl alcohol and water in a ratio of 15 15 70 parts by weight. At the same time as the resin solution is diluted, the alkali metal carbonate is added. Ordinarily, the resin solutions of the invention, containing the alkali metal carbonate, are diluted with one of these solvent systems to a viscosity not less than 2.0 poise 0.2 Pa.s . Conveniently, the resin solutions are diluted to a viscosity below 3.5 poise 0.35 Pa.s , and preferably 2.5 poise 0.25 Pa.s . The mole ratios of the phenolic compounds usually vary from 50 95 moles of phenol to 50 5 moles of resorcinol per 100 moles of total phenolic compounds. The resorcinol enhances the reactivity of the resin and it is, therefore, necessary to have a minimum of about 5 mole resorcinol present. When the resin contains an insufficient amount of resorcinol, the temperature required for curing rises considerably, and if the resorcinol is omitted entirely, curing temperatures of 240 The mole ratio of formaldehyde to the total phenolic portion of the resin is in the range 0.55 0.75 mole per mole of phenolic component. If an excess is used, the stability of the resulting resin is impaired which adversely affects both the pot life and the washability of the adhesive prepared therefrom. Conversely there must be a minimum amount of formaldehyde present sufficient to effect substantial condensation of the phenol portion of the resin. An alkali metal sulphite is required to catalyze the initial condensation reaction. The amount of alkali metal sulphite used should be sufficient to produce a pH in the range of from 8.5 to 9.2. Preferably, the amount of sulphite used, based upon a mole ratio of sulphite to formaldehyde, should be 0.04 to 0.09 mole of sulphite catalyst per mole of formaldehyde. If less than 0.04 mole of sulphite is used, there is insufficient catalyst to advance the condensation of the resin to the required degree and adhesives prepared therefrom have poor gluing properties, particularly with respect to delamination. Conversely, if an amount of sulphite greater than 0.09 mole is used, there are undesirable side reactions between the sulphite and the formaldehyde which tend to prevent condensation of the phenol and formaldehyde. The alkali metal sulphite catalysts useful in the present invention include the sodium, potassium and lithium sulphites. Sodium sulphite, being the most economical and the most readily available, is preferred. The bisulphites of the alkali metals are equivalent to the sulphites if used in an equivalent amount on an SO₃ basis and therefore their use is within the scope of the present invention. On the other hand, it has been found that other alkalis, such as sodium hydroxide and the like, cannot be used to prepare the novel resins of the present invention. For a better understanding of the invention, and to show more clearly how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings in which The schematic flow diagram of Figure 1 shows a process for preparing water soluble, fusible phenol resorcinol formaldehyde resins having a composition comprising 50 95 moles phenol and 50 5 moles resorcinol per 100 moles of total phenolic compound. The resin is made by reacting the phenol and all of the formaldehyde in the presence of 0.04 0.09 mole of an alkali metal sulphite catalyst per mole of formaldehyde and refluxing the reaction mixture until the mixture has attained a viscosity of U V Gardner letter. Resorcinol is then added to the reaction mixture and refluxing is continued until the resin has a constant viscosity in the range 30 100 Gardner seconds. To render the resin suitable for use in adhesive formulations, it is diluted with a water miscible solvent to give a solution having a solids content of 48 by weight and a viscosity of about 2.5 poise 0.25 Pa.s . An alkali metal carbonate is added substantially simultaneously with the addition of the water miscible solvent in the amount of 6 parts by weight per 100 parts of resin. Potassium carbonate is the preferred alkali metal carbonate for this purpose. Fumed silica in the amount of 2 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of resin solution is then stirred into the resin to web it after which a high shear SONOLATOR is used to mix it with the resin to form a high solids thixotropic resin having a viscosity of about 40 15 poise 4 1.5 Pa.s . The phenol resorcinol formaldehyde resin solution prepared as described above can be mixed with a hardener comprising paraformaldehyde or paraformaldehyde in one of its higher polymeric forms at a pH of about 9.5, along with conventional fillers and extenders as desired, to give a novel phenolic resin adhesive. The hardener could be incorporated in a slurry and one slurry which has been found not to separate consists of paraformaldehyde in the amount of 45.1 by weight, nut shell flour in the amount of 39.2 by weight, polyvinyl alcohol in the amount of 9.85 by weight and ATTOGEL The schematic flow diagram of Figure 2 shows an alternative embodiment of the invention in which formaldehyde and phenol are reacted in the presence of an alkali metal sulphite catalyst in the manner described above. Also in the manner described above, the reaction mixture is heated to reflux until the mixture has a viscosity of from U V Gardner letter on the Gardner Holdt bubble test after which the resorcinol is added and the refluxing continued until the viscosity is substantially constant and in the range 300 100 Gardner seconds. At this point this embodiment differs from the one described above in that polyvinyl alcohol is added and fluxing is continued until the viscosity is in the range of from 95 to 105 poise 9.5 10.5 Pa.s and preferably is about 100 poise 10 Pa.s In the manner described in the first embodiment, a water miscible solvent and an alkali metal carbonate are then added to produce a low solids resin having a viscosity of about 3.0 poise 0.3 Pa.s . Fumed silica is then added in the manner described in the first embodiment to produce a low solids thixotropic resin having a viscosity of about 30 10 poise 3 1 Pa.s . An adhesive of the invention can be prepared by mixing the resin solution, adjusted to the desired viscosity as described hereinabove, with paraformaldehyde hardener at a pH of 7.5 9.5 along with suitable fillers and extenders if desired. In order to provide the long pot life characteristic of the adhesive of the invention, it is preferable to use as hardener or setting agent paraformaldehyde, either as such or as one of its higher polymers commonly referred to as alpha polyoxymenthylene and beta polyoxymethylene. The higher polymers of paraformaldehyde are easily prepared by heating a paraformaldehyde to a temperature of approximately 100 The paraformaldehyde is conveniently added as a hardener portion of the adhesive mix along with the conventional extenders and fillers, such as walnut shell flour, wood flour, and the like. Prior to the addition of the hardener portion, the pH of the adhesive mix is adjusted to 7.5 to 9.5, preferably by the addition of 50 percent aqueous caustic. If the pH of the adhesive mix is less than 7.5, the rapid curing characteristics are not attained. If the pH is greater than 9.5, the pot life of the adhesive is drastically reduced. The bonding characteristics of phenol resorcinol formaldehyde resins and adhesives are conventionally evaluated by a compression shear test ASTM D 905 and a vacuum pressure delamination test ASTM D 2559 . The numerical results of these tests depend upon the type of wood to be bonded. On Douglas fir compression shear tests of bonds made using the adhesive of the invention shows 80 95 percent wood failure. The wood failure on Southern pine is 80 95 percent. In both cases these results are considered to be excellent. The bond provided by the adhesives of the invention shows, according to the vacuum pressure delamination test, less than one percent delamination for Douglas fir and less than three percent delamination for Southern pine. Such resins and adhesives were also found to cure significantly faster than conventional phenol resorcinol formaldehyde resins and adhesives. The invention is further illustrated by the following Examples A phenol resorcinol formaldehyde resin was prepared according to the following charge schedule The ingredients were added in the following ratio The formaldehyde was charged to a 1000 U.S. gallon reactor fitted with a pump for agitation and the sodium sulphite was then gradually added. Agitation was commenced and the mixture was maintained at a temperature of about 30 A resin prepared by the above procedure should have a gel time of about 200 minutes when 100 parts are treated with a setting agent comprising 8 parts heat treated paraformaldehyde polyoxymethylene and 12 parts walnut shell flour. Following the procedure of Example 1, with the exception that polyvinyl alcohol was added to thicken the resin and additional water was added to adjust viscosity, a lower cost resin was prepared according to the following formulation. The procedure of Example 1 was modified such that after the resorcinol was added and a constant viscosity had been obtained the polyvinyl alcohol was added and reflux continued to a constant viscosity which was 110 poise 11 Pa.s . The reaction mass was cooled and diluted with 580 pounds 263 kg of ethyl alcohol, 190 pounds 86.2 kg of ethylene glycol, 2430 pounds 1102.2 kg of water and 600 pounds 272.2 kg of 47 potassium carbonate solution to a visosity of 4.4 poise 0.44 Pa.s at 23 The resin should have a gel time of 190 minutes when 100 parts by weight was treated with 209 parts of a setting agent comprising 8 parts heat treated paraformaldehyde polyoxymethylene and 12 parts walnut shell flour. A compression shear test ASTM D 905 was performed on three laminated Douglas Fir samples. In the first of these samples, Sample I , there was used an adhesive as described above which was formed from a phenol resorcinol formaldehyde resin which contained 4 parts by weight potassium carbonate per 100 parts resin. The second of these samples, Sample II , was an adhesive as described above which contained 6 parts by weight potassium carbonate per 100 parts resin. The third of these sample, Sample III , was a conventional adhesive which contained 5 parts conventional sodium hydroxide per 100 parts resin. These samples were subject to pressure and that pressure was measured at certain time intervals. Percent wood failure, percent delamination and minimum mix gel time were also measured. The temperature was 50 A phenol resorcinol formaldehyde resin was prepared according to the following charge schedule The ingredients were added in the following ratio The formaldehyde was charged to a 1000 U.S. gallon reactor fitted with a pump for agitation and the sodium sulphite was gradually added. Agitation was commenced and the mixture maintained at a temperature of about 30 A resin prepared by the above procedure should have a gel time of about 200 minutes when 100 parts are treated with a setting agent slurry comprising 2 parts water and 8.6 parts paraformaldehyde, 7.4 parts Pecan shell flour, 1.9 parts polyvinyl alcohol and 1.1 parts attapulgite clay.
