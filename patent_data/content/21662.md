# Improved multi layer absorbent pad for disposable absorbent articles and process for producing same.

## Abstract
A multi layer absorbent pad 20 for use in disposable absorbent articles, such as diapers 10 and the like, to absorb body fluids is characterized by having superior fluid transfer from a top uncompressed receiving layer 21 to a bottom compressed layer 22 and wicking and spreading action of the body fluids within the bottom layer 22 to provide a drier top surface to the absorbent pad. The top layer 21 is formed of fiberized cellulosic fibers including a cationic debonding agent provided therein prior to fiberization for obtaining more complete fiberization of the fibers and greater height and loft to the layer while producing resistance to normally occurring hydrogen bonds between the fibers in the layer to resist compression of the layer and maintain the height and loft of the absorbent pad. The bottom layer 22 is formed of fiberized cellulosic fibers without a cationic debonding agent therein for allowing compression of the layer by effecting the normally occurring hydrogen bonds between the fibers in the compressed layer 22 to provide a more densified layer for improved fluid wicking and spreading action.
