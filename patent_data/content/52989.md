# METHOD OF FABRICATING A SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE

## Abstract
A method for making a MOSFET device 20 in a semiconductor body 10 includes forming source and drain contact electrodes 12.1, 12.2 prior to growth of the gate oxide 10.3 and after formation of a high conductivity surface region. The exposed mutually opposing sidewall edges of each of the contact electrodes 12.1, 12.2 are coated with a sidewall silicon dioxide layer 15.1, 15.2 , and the exposed surface of the semiconductor body 10 between these sidewalls is then etched to separate the high conduc tivity surface region into the source and drain regions 10.1, 10.2 . Formation and etching of the high conductivity region may be omitted by using Schottky barrier or impurity doped material for the contact electrodes 12.1, 12.2 .
