## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a semirotat ing one effect pneumatic actuater,with spring return. As it is well known the rotating movement of the shut off member of some valves may be advantageously provided,for opening and closing said valves, by rotative types of actuators,which are generally operated by a pressurized fluid. The mentioned actuators essentially consist of a hydraulic or pneumatic semirotating motor, with direct or indirect drive. More specifically,in the actuators of the above type,as directly driven, comprising two plungers thereon the pressurized fluid acts and thereby the motion and driving forces are transmitt ed to an output shaft, through a rack gear wheel type of coupling, the return stroke of said plungers is usually obtained by means of biassing springs. That approach, though it is advantageous since it provides a safer operation, is however affected by sone drawbacks related to the assembling and maintenance operations. Infact that structure may be hardly assembled since,after having mounted the piece,the insertion and locking of the springs in the respective seats involve an intricate operation of pushing the sealing bottom members, because of the great diameter or said springs and tne pressing resistance whereof. The complexity of the mentioned operations, in actual practice,makes impossible to maintain the actuator in situ,and said actuator has necessarily to be removed for changing the sealing gaskets, cleaning purposes and so on.Infact it is practically impossible to disengage the bottom members, unless special tools are used, such as locking clamps, efiective to resist against tie pushing of a plurality of springs. Moreover,in the known one effeft actuators witn spring return, it is not possible to precisely adjust the spring loading, with respect to the driving pressure and the valve resisting torque, unless the springs are replaced. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, the task of the present invention is to overcome the thereinabove mentioned drawbacks,by providing such an one effect semiretating pneumatic actuator which is effective to be easily and quickly assembled. Within that task it is a main object of the present invention to provide such an one effect semirotating pneumatic actuator,with spring return, which is effective to be serviced without the need or removing it from the system. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide such an one effect semirotating pneumatic actuator,with spring return, therein it is possible, by means of simple operations, to substantially continuously adjust the spring loading. Yet another object ef the present invention is to provide such an one effect semirotating pneumatic actuator,with spring return,which is of safe and reliable operation and therein each individual spring iay be easily counterbiassed and quickly removed or added,without the need of disengaging the mentioned bottom members, by simply unthreading r single spring guiding threaded plug member. According to one aspect of the present invention the thereinabove task and objects,as well as yet other objects,nhich will become more apparent thereinafter,are achieved by an one effect pneumatic semirotating actuator, with spring return,characterized in that the plungers thereof are pushed,during the return stroke, by a plurality of cooperating springs, said springs having parallel axes and being each arranged in a respective seat and held in place therein by a corresponding spring guiding plug member. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Further characteristics and advantages of the one effect semirotating pneumatic actuator with spring return according to the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment thereof, being illustrated,by way of an indicative but not limitative example in the figures of the accompanying drawings, where fig.l is a longitudinal cross sectional view of the pneumatic actuator according to the present invention fig.2 is a transversal cross section ef that same actuator,as taken through a middle plane and fig.3 is a side view illustrating tie same actuator. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT With reference to the number rererences of the figures of tne accompanying drawings, tie one effect semirotating pneumatic actuator,with spring return,accoraing to tne present invention, comprises a round cross sectioa tubular body 1, which is closed, at the two ends whereof,by means of suitably designed bottom members 2. More specifically said bottom members are provided with a plurality of throughgoing holes 3,having s respective threaded end,and formed at symmetrical positions,being preferably concentrically arranged. A corresponding number of counterbores 4 are provided,at corresponding positions, in the bases of the two plungers 5, which latter are provided with opposite surfaces of rack configuration 6,engaging with a gear wheel 7,which latter is keyed on a shaft 8 also bearing an outer sprocket 9. Into the mentioned throughgoing holes and counterbores there are inserted corresponding coil springs 10,which are held in place by means of threaded spring guiding plug members ll,at least one whereof, indicated at ll ,is provided with a silencer. Thus,in actual practice, it is possible to easily assemble and disassemble the actuator, by introducing and removing the individual springs, thereby the servicing is facilitated. Mereover, by changing the spring number,it is possible to easily adjust the pushing load on the two plungers, with respect to the driving fluid pressure and the valve resisting or counterbiassing torque, the shut off member whereof is driven by means of the mentioned sprocket 9. The driving fluid is supplied through the hole 12,therefrom a duct not shown extends conveying it to the chamber 13,as defined by the two plungers 5 and the wall ol the tubular body 1. The two mentioned bottom members,2,moreover, are provided with a central threaded throughgoing hole there into a round cross section threaded member 14 is inserted,one end whereof,by counterbiassing said plungers, is efiective to restrain the stroke thereof. Prom the above disclesure and the figures oi the accompanying drawings the great functionality and adjusting and assembling facility characteriz ing the one effect semirotating pneumatic actuator, with spring return, according to tie present invention, will be self evident. It should obviously be note that the subject actuator has been thereinabove disciosed and illustrated only by way of an indicative example and only to demonstrate the main characteristics of the present invention,which latter is therefore susceptible to all variations ana modifications falling within its scope and spirit as defined in the accompanying claims.
