# FOLDING LADDER WITH THREE STILES

## Abstract
A ladder comprises a pair of main stiles 1 , a series of centrally hinged rungs 5 with ends 7, 8 articulated to the two main stiles 1 , whereby the ladder can adopt a folded inoperative configuration in which the main stiles 1 are alongside each other and an extended operative configura tion in which the main stiles 1 are spaced from each other, and means for stopping the ladder in the extended operative configuration. The main stiles 1 are articulated together at their upper ends and the ladder further includes a single auxiliary stile 3 articulated at its upper end to the two upper ends of the main stiles 1 about an axis 4 substantially perpendicular to the articulation axis 2 of the two main stiles 1 . The auxiliary stile 3 is movable between a position alongside the two main stiles 1 , corresponding to the folded inoperative condition of the ladder, and a position spaced from the main stiles 1 , corresponding to the extended operative condition of the ladder.
