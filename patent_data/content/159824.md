## Description
Semiconductor device with recessed capacitor The present invention relates generally to semiconductor devices and, more particularly, to a dynamic random access memory having memory cells each of which comprises a MOS transistor and a MOS capacitor and a plurality of dummy cells used to sense the logic state of a selected memory cell. In a dynamic RAM random access memory , logical data is electrically stored in a matrix of memory cells, each of which includes a MOS metal oxide semiconductor transistor and a MOS capacitor for storing a charge.Such memory cells are typically associated with each of the memory s bit lines. A number of dummy cells are also included in the dRAM device. Each of such kind of cells includes a dummy capacitor which is precharged to a reference voltage level. In the data read mode of the memory, to sense the logical state of an addressed memory cell, the charge on the memory s cell capacitor is dumped on a first bit line and the charge on the dummy cell s capacitor is dumped on a second bit line. The resultant difference in voltage on the two bit lines is used as an indication of whether the selected memory cell is in a logic 1 or 0 state. The storage of data in the MOS capacitor is made in a manner that a charge is also stored in the MOS capacitor. The charge storage capacity of the MOS capacitor thus greatly influences the data storage per formance. Increasing the charge storage capacity of theMOS capacitor reduces the degree of integration of the dRAM, although this can contribute to the improvement of the basic performance of the dRAM. This is so because an increase in the charge storage capacity is attained by an increase in the capacitor area, which causes the area exclusively occupied by one element to increase and hence reduces the number of elements that can be formed in a unit area. In order to increase the charge storage capacity of the K S capacitor while restricting the exclusive area of the substrate occupied by the MOS capacitor, it is contemplated to enlarge the capacitor area by forming a recess in the substrate surface in a memory capacitor formation region. In a dRAM that is realized on the basis of the above concept, it is desired in order to provide for the utmost redundancy of the sense amplifier operation to set the ratio between the stored charge Qm in a memory cell capacitor Cm and stored charge Qd in a dummy cell capacitor Cd to 2 1.The stored charge is generally expressed as Q C V, and hence the above setting of the stored charge ratio can be attained either by 1 setting the ratio of the capacitance Cm of theMOS capacitor constituting the memory cell to the capacitance Cd of the MOS capacitor constituting the duny cell to 2 I, or by 2 setting the ratio of the write voltage Vm applied to the memory cell to the write voltage Vd applied to the dummy cell to 2 1. of the above two approaches, the second approach requires an additional circuit arrangement for stably generating and supplying the write voltage applied to the duisay cell, leading to an undesired increase of the chip area and production cost. The second approach is free from the above drawback, but it has a fabrication difficulty in that it is difficult to satisfactorily control errors in shape in the process of forming the recess noted above, such errors cause undesired fluctuations of the capacitance ratio.Assuming that the recess is rectangular and has a constant depth, doubling the total length of the sides of the recess to make the capacitance of the memory cell double the capacitance of the dummy cell, leads to different values between the memory and dummy cells of the error AL that occurs for each side of the recess in an etching process of forming the recess. With such a variation of errors, the normal control of the capacitance ratio deteriorates. To solve this problem, it has been suggested to form two recesses in the memory cell capacitor while forming one recess in the dummy cell capacitor. More specifically, for each memory cell capacitor two recesses, with the total length of the sides being a first length, are formed in the substrate, while for each dummy cell capacitor one recess with the total length of the sides being a second length equal to one half the first length is formed. In this case, even if the planar shape of these recesses which determine the capacitances of the memory cell capacitor and dummy cell capacitor is changed due to errors in the etching process of forming the recesses, the ratio of the first to the second lengths of the resultant recesses is constant at 2 1.It is thus possible to control the ratio of the capacitance between the first and second recesses so that it coincides with a predetermined value. However, with increasing dRAM integration density in the future the distance between the two capacitor recesses in the memory cell is reduced. Where the two capacitor recesses are close to each other, there arises a problem, in that depletion layers, that are formed around the recesses when a charge is stored, are contiguous to each other. If the depletion layers around the two recesses are contiguous to each other, the charge storage performance greatly deteriorates, resulting in a decrease of the cell capacitance.Further, it is difficult to precisely set the capacitance ratio of the memory cell to the dummy cell to 2 1. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a new and improved semiconductor device, which can improve the charge storage performance of the cell capacitor section without sacrificing any of the integration density. It is anOther object of the present invention to provide a new and improved semiconductor memory device, which permits satisfactory control of the capacitance ratio between the dummy cell and memory cell in an ordinary fabrication process as well as permitting improvement in the charge storage capacity without sacrificing the degree of integration. With the semiconductor device according to the invention, a capacitor that is formed on a semiconductor substrate has a plurality of recesses formed in the substrate. When a charge is stored in these recesses, depletion layers are formed around these recesses.According to the invention, a depletion layer spread suppressor is provided, which can restrict the spreading of the depletion layers formed round the plurality of recesses to thereby prevent the depletion layers from being contiguous to one another. The depletion layer spread suppressor includes a high impurity concentration semiconductor region, which surrounds the plurality of recesses and has the same conductivity type as the conductivity type of the substrate. The high impurity concentration semiconductor region has a higher impurity concentration than that of the substrate. The present invention is best understood by reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a fragmentary enlarged scale pictorial diagram showing a dynamic random access memory referred to as dRAM, hereinafter cell region as a preferred embodiment of the invention Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view taken along line II II in Fig. 1 showing a memory cell section Fig. 3 is a cross sectional view taken along lineIII III in Fig. 1 showing the memory cell section Fig. 4 is a cross sectional view taken along lineIV IV in Fig. 1 showing a dummy cell section and Fig. 5 is a cross sectional view taken along lineV V in Fig. 1 showing the dummy cell section. In a semiconductor dynamic random access memory or dRAM as one preferred embodiment of the invention, one memory cell includes a memory cell transistor and a memory cell capacitor which is charged to reflect the logic state of its memory cell, while one dummy cell includes a dummy cell transistor and a dummy cell capacitor which is adopted to be precharged to a selected voltage level. A plurality of bit lines and word lines are provided for accessing a selected or particular memory cell. Referring to Fig. 1, there is shown, in a fragmentary enlarged scale pictorial view, a memory cell region and a dummy cell region of a dRAM as one preferred embodiment of the invention. In the illustrated arrangement, memory cell section 10 and dummy cell section 12 are formed on a substrate 14 of a first conductivity type e.g., p conductivity type . The memory cell 10 includes a MOS capacitor Cm and a MOS FET Qm.The dummy cell section 12 includes a MOS capacitor Cd and a MOS FET Qd. The surface area of the substrate 14 where the MOS capacitor Cm of the memory cell 10 is formed has two recesses 16a and 16b of the same shape. The recesses 16a and 16b are rectangular in shape. In this embodiment, these recesses 16a and 16b are fabricated such that they have an equal constant depth. The surface area of the substrate 14 where the MOS capacitor Cd of the dummy cell 12 is formed, on the other hand, has a single recess 18. The recess 18 is also rectangular in shape, and it has the same depth as that of the recesses 16a and 16b. It should be noted that the total length of the four sides of the rectangle of each recess 16a or 16b of the memory cell capacitor Cm is equal to the total length of the sides of the rectangle of the recess 18 of the dummy cell capacitor Cd. Figs. 2 and 3 are cross sectional views taken along line Il Il and line 111 111 in Fig. 1 and illustrate the memory cell section 10. A p type well region 20 and a semiconductor layer 21 of a second conductivity type or n type, are formed in a cell region defined by a field insulating film 22 formed in the p type substrate 10.The n type semiconductor layer 21 constitutes one of the electrodes of the memory cell capacitor Cm. The two recesses 16a and 16b are formed in the p type well region 20. The way, in which the two recesses 16a and 16b are formed side by side in the well region 20, is most clearly shown in Fig. 3. The recesses 16a and 16b are formed by a reactive ion etching RIE process using an etching mask not shown . The p type well region 20 is formed by ion implantation or thermal diffusion of p type impurities. Particularly, the region 20 is formed such that it has a higher impurity concentration than the impurity concentration of the p type substrate and will hereinafter be referred to as p type well region .The shape of the p type well region 20 is controlled such that it will not intrude into a certain substrate region where a cell transistor Qm to be described later is formed, that is, it will exclude the transistor formation region of the substrate, as is apparent from Fig. 2. In the MOS capacitor Cm, a gate oxide film 24a and a polycrystalline silicon layer 26, which serves as a capacitor electrode, are formed in the mentioned order on the substrate surface where the recesses 16a and 16b are formed, whereby the MOS capacitor Cm of the memory cell 10 is completed. Attention should be given to the fact that the MOS capacitor electrode 26 is provided commonly over a region other than the MOS FET regions of each memory cell and dummy cell. As shown in Fig. 2, the MOS FET Qm of the memory cell 10 includes n type diffusion layers 28 and 30, which are formed by they ion implantation technique and serve as the source and drain, respectively, and a gate layer 32 formed on the gate oxide film 24b formed on the substrate 14. The gate layer 32 is formed in selfalignment to the n type diffusion layers 28 and 30.An insulating layer 34, such as a SiO2 layer for instance, is deposited on the wafer structure described above. A portion of the SiO2 layer 34 on the n type layer 30 is removed by a well known technique, so that an opening is formed as a contact hole 36. A conductive layer 38 is formed such that it is electrically connected to the drain layer 30 of theMOS FET Qm in the portion thereof exposed in the contact hole 32. The conductive layer 38 serves as a bit line for the MOS FET Qm of the memory cell 10. Figs. 4 and 5 are cross sectional views taken along line IV IV and line V V in Fig. 1 and illustrate the dummy cell section 12. A p type well region 40 and an n type semiconductor layer 41 are formed in a dummy cell region defined by the field insulative film 22 formed in the p type substrate 10. The n type semiconductor layer 41 constitutes one of the electrodes of the dummy cell capacitor Cd. The recess 18 of the dummy cell capacitor Cd, noted above, is formed in the p type well region 40. The recess 18 and p type well region 40 are formed in the same way as the memory cell 10 described above. A gate oxide film 24a and a polycrystalline silicon layer 26 which serves as a capacitor electrode are formed in the mentioned order on the substrate surface where the recess 18 is formed, thus completing the MOS capacitor Cd of the dummy cell 12. As shown in Fig. 4, the MOS FET Qd of the dummy cell 12 includes n type diffusion layers 42 and 44 serving as the source and drain, respectively, and a gate layer 46, which is formed on the gate oxide film 24b formed on the substrate 14 in a self aligned relationship with the n type diffusion layers 42 and 44. The insulative layer 34, such as a SiO2 layer, that is deposited on the wafer structure noted above is also partly etched away to form a contact hole 48. A conductive layer 50, which, serves as a bit line for theMOS FET Qd of the dummy cell 12, is electrically connected to the drain layer 44 of the MOS FET Qd in the portion thereof exposed in the contact hole 48. As has been described, the above embodiment of the dRAM according to the invention has two recesses 16a and 16b formed in the MOS capacitor region of the memory cell 10 and one recess 18 formed in the MOS capacitor region of the dummy cell 12. The formation of these recesses 16a, 16b and 18 is necessary for setting the charge storage ratio of the memory cell 10 to the dummy cell 12 to 2 1 as is well known to persons skilled in the art. With this embodiment of the invention the capacitance ratio of the memory cell 10 to the dummy cell 12 is set to 2 1 with the two recesses provided for the memory cell capacitor and one recess for the dummy cell capacitor, so that an equal constant voltage may be applied as a read out voltage to both the cells in the data read out mode. That is, only a single level of voltage is necessary for the data read out. It is thus possible to simplify the circuit construction necessary for the voltage generation and at the same time stabilize the data read out operation. The structure with the recesses noted above further greatly contributes to effectively increasing the capacitance without increasing the capacitor surface region area.It is thus possible to greatly increase the amount of charge carriers that can be stored in each capacitor without reducing the memory integration degree. It should be noted that in the memory cell section of the above structure the impurity concentration of the substrate region surrounding the recesses 16a and 16b is particularly increased. In this embodiment it is important that the two recesses 16a and 16b are confined together with the electrode layer 21 in the p type well region 20. The well region 20 has the effect of suppressing or preventing the spread of the depletion layers formed around the recesses 16a and 16b with storage of charge in the cell capacitor Cd when data is stored in the cell. That is, the well region 20 can reliably prevent the depletion layers around the capacitor recesses 16a and 16b from spreading and becoming contiguous to each other in a region 20a between the two recesses 16a and 16b as shown in Fig. 3.Thus, it is possible to improve the charge stored in the capacitor recesses 16a and 16b based on the writing of data in the memory cell 10. This is so because the suppression of the spread of the depletion layers around the recesses 16a and 16b owing to the increased impurity concentration of the well region 20 can improve the charge storage efficiency of the memory cell capacitor Cm that is constituted by the recesses 16a and 16b. Further, the suppression of the spread of the depletion layers around the recesses 16a and 16b permits satisfactory setting of the capacitance ratio of the memory cell to the dummy cell to 2 1. This permits an improvement of the basic electric performance of the dRAM. According to the invention, it is further possible to suppress the fluctuations or errors in the etching process of forming the recesses 16a, 16b and 18 in the substrate 14 basically to zero very readily and without need of any special etching technique. This means that the following advantages can be obtained 1 The capacitance ratio between the memory cell 1Q and dummy cell 12 can be controlled with high precision or improved precision. 2 The normal operation redundancy of the sense amplifier circuit that is required for the data read out can be improved to improve the reliability of the data read out operation. This is so because the memory capacitor Cm is not formed of a single enlarged recess but of two recesses 16a and 16b of an identical rectangular planar shape, which is the same in shape and total length as the four sides of the recess 18 formed in the dummy cell 12. The reason for this is that the formation of the two recesses 16a and 16b in the memory cell capacitor section can equalize the rate of increase of capacitance of the dummy cell due to an error in the etching process and the rate of increase of the capacitance of the memory cell due to an error in the etching process. Detailed elucidation will now be made of the fact that the structure of the embodiment where the ratio of the number of recesses between the memory cell and dummy cell is 2 1 which permits precise setting of the capacitance ratio between the memory cell capacitor and dummy cell capacitor to 2 1 even if errors occur in the etching process. Denoting the total length of the four sides of the recess 18 provided in the MOS capacitor section of the dummy cell 12 by Ld, the sumLm of the total lengths of the four sides of the two recesses 16a and 16b provided in the MOS capacitor section of the memory cell 10 is Lm 2Ld. Now it is assumed that an error AL occurs in the X and Y directions of the substrate surface in the etching process of recess formation in the substrate 14 of the dRAM.In this case, the total length Ld of the four sides of the recess 18 of the dummy cell capacitor Cd is increased to Ld 4AL, and the rate of increase is 4AL Ld. The dummy cell capacitance is also increased at this rate. On the other hand, the sum Lm of the total lengths of the four sides of the recesses 16a and 16b of the memory cell capacitor Cm is increased to Lm 2 4awl , and the rate of increase is 8AL Lm. Since Lm 2Ld, 8AL Lm 8AL 2Ld 4AL Ld.Hence, the rate of increase of the sum Lm of the total lengths of the four sides of the recesses 16a and 16b of the memory cell capacitor Cm is equal to the rate of increase of the total length of the four sides of the recess 18 of the dummy cell capacitor Cd. That is, if an error is produced in the recesses 16a, 16b and 18 in the etching process, the rate of capacitance increases not the capacitor increase due to the error being equal for the memory cell 10 and for the dummy cell 12.In other words, when the total length Ld of the four sides of the recess 18 of the dummy cell capacitor Cd is increased, the aggregate side length of the recesses 16a and 16b of the MOS capacitor Cm of the memory cell 10 is also increased at double the rate of increase of the total side length of the dummy cell capacitor recess.In effect, the capacitance ratio substantially remains unchanged. In contrast, where only a single large recess is provided for the memory cell 20 such that the total length of its four sides is double that of the recess 18 of the dummy cell section 12, if the capacitance of the dummy cell 12 is increased with an increase of the total length Ld of the source sides of the recess 18 due to an error AL in the etching process for the formation of recesses in the substrate surface, the capacitance of the memory cell 10 will increase at a different rate from the rate of increase ofvthe capacitance of the dummy cell 12 i.e., at a greater rate . Therefore, the capacitance ratio between the memory cell and dummy cell will be greatly deviated from the normal ratio.In this case, therefore, precise setting of the capacitance ratio can no longer be expected with the existing fabrication technology level. Approaches to solve the problem by improving the etching technology itself would dictate an enormous development cost to the enterprise.Besides, it would take a considerable time until such an improvement is in practical use. Although the present invention has been shown and described with reference to particular embodiments, various changes and modifications which are obvious to a person skilled in the art to which the invention pertains are deemed to lie within the scope of the invention. For example, while in the above embodiment the high impurity density well region has been formed to surround the two recesses 16a and 16b formed in the memory cell 10, such a well region is by no means limitative. In a case where it is difficult to diffuse impurities in the regions corresponding to the two recesses 16a and 16b in each memory cell due to a fabrication process ground, a high impurity concentration region may be formed over the entire area inclusive of the cell transistor formation region, and then the transistor formation region may be set substantially to the same impurity density as that of the substrate. It is important that a high impurity concentration region be formed only in a cell capacitor region so that it will not extend into the cell transistor formation region. So long as this is satisfied, it is possible to suppress or prevent an undesired spread of the depletion layers around the two recesses 16a and 16b of each memory cell, which is a basic feature of the invention.
