# METHOD OF RATE ENHANCEMENT FOR TRIESTER SYNTHESIS OF OLIGONUCLEOTIDES USING A CATALYTIC ALCOHOL, AND COMPOUNDS FOR USE THEREIN

## Abstract
The rate of the triester method of oligonucleotide synthesis is increased by using a phosphotriester formation catalyst blocking group diester linked to the 3 phosphate of a nucleotide or an oligonucleotide , thus forming a nuc leotide phosphodiester Insert here wherein Base is a nucleotide base wherein Pr is a nucleotide 5 hydroxyl protecting group, for example, monomethoxytrityl or dimethoxytrityl wherein R includes a substituted or unsubstituted, aryl, alkyl, cycloalkyl or beta cyanoalkyl blocking group wherein CAT is a catalytic moiety, which is, for example, a substituted or unsubstituted, nitrogen heterocycle, tertiary amine or a carboxylic acid. The use of these groups so linked to form nucleotide phosphodiesters enhances the rate of an internucleotide condensation reaction. Following condensation which re sults in the formation of a phosphotriester the phosphotries ter formation catalyst blocking group can be removed leav ing a di nucleotide, or the condensation reaction can be repeated to synthesize an oligonucleotide.
