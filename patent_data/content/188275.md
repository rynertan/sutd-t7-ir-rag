# Rear suspension controller system.

## Abstract
When a shock due to a protrusion or dip P,m of a road surface is detected at the front wheels d , of a vehicle during its cruising on the road surface. the characteristic of the rear wheel suspension c , of the vehicle is altered immediately or just before the rear wheels pass it to improve the controlla bility and the stability of the vehicle or the feeling of the ride thereof. For that purpose, a rear suspension controller includes a height sensor e for detecting the distance between the body a of the vehicle and each of the right and left front wheels d thereof, a height data calculator f which generates a plurality of height data from the front vehicle height, a judgment section g which compares each of the height data with a respective reference value that is predeter mined corresponding to each height datum and a rear suspension characteristic alteration device h which alter the spring constant, damping force, etc. of the rear suspension. The height data calculator extracts sunstartial data from the front vehicle height signal which represents the shape of the bump or dip for judging adequately when to alter the rear suspension characteristic.
