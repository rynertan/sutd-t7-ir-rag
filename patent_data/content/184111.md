# Data distributor capable of selecting an optional partial data signal and distribution device comprising a plurality of the data distributors.

## Abstract
In a data distributor for distributing an output data signal to an output port in response to an input data signal divisible into a plurality of channel signals arranged in channels, respectively, a position number signal is specific to a position of the data distributor and converted by a convert ing unit into a specific channel number signal representative of a specific one of the channels. The specific channel number signal is compared by a comparator with each channel number signal received in synchronism with the channel signals, to detect coincidence therebetween. On detection of coincidence, an AND gate allows a part of the input data signal to pass therethrough as the output data signal. The specific channel number signal is produced by comparing the position number signal with a sequence of port number signals given from a first signal source and representative of each output port and by loading a memory unit with one of internal channel number signals sent from a second signal source, in response to a result of comparison. The one of the internal channel number signal is delivered as the specific channel number signal to the comparator.
