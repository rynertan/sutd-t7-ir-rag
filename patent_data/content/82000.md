# DP matching system for recognizing a string of words.

## Abstract
A connected word recognition system operable according to a DP algorithm and in compliance with a regular grammar, is put into operation in synchronism with successive specification of feature vectors of an input pattern. In an m th period in which an m th feature vector is specified, similarity measures are calculated 58, 59 between reference patterns representative of reference words and those fragmentary patterns of the input pattern, which start at several previous periods and end at the m th period, for start and end states of the reference words. In the m th period, an extremum of the similarity measures is found 66, 69, 86 , together with a particular word and a particular pair of start and end states thereof, and stored 61 63 . Moreover, a particular start period is selected 67, 86 and stored 64 . A previous extremum found and stored 61 during the m 1 th period for the particular start state found in the m 1 th period, is used in the m th period as a boundary condition in calculating each similarity measure. After all input pattern feature vectors are processed, a result of recognition is obtained 89 by referring to the stored extrema, particular words, particular start states, and particular start periods.
