# Thermal transfer printer.

## Abstract
A clearance between a platen 10 and a thermal head 47 to a width which is not less than a maximum diameter of one roll of an ink film ribbon 102 is set by a thermal head driving motor 42 . A ribbon cassette 201 231 241 is moved to a printing position and changed after a printing with the ink ribbon 102 has been completed to next ribbon cassette 202 232 242 . A guiding means of the ribbon cassettes 201, 202 in the predetermined positions is adapted to be rotated through a plate 86 for sending out the ribbon cassette 201 and receiving the ribbon cassette 202 by a ribbon cassette motor 92 . The plate 86 is joined to a take up end portion of the ribbon cassettes 201, 202 . The guiding means is adapted to be moved forward and backward for sending out the ribbon cassette 231 and receiving the ribbon cassette 232 by a transfer belt 234 which can be moved by a cassette moving motor 233 . The guiding means is adapted to be changed by withdrawing from the ink ribbon 102 to another ink ribbon 102 by a fixing member 246 which can be moved by a ribbon cassette motor 243 . A plurality of the ribbon cassettes 201, 202 231, 232 241, 242 can be used selectively, so that the useless feeding of the ink ribbon 102 can be prevented.
