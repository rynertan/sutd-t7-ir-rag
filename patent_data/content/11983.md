# Regenerative rotodynamic machines.

## Abstract
In a regenerative rotodynamic machine, a portion of a disc like impeller 11 adjacent the impeller periphery extends radially through an annular chamber 13 in the machine cas ing concentric with the impeller, thereby dividing said chamber into two annular side channels 13A, 13B one on each side of the impeller. The portion of the impeller lying in the annular chamber has scooped out annular cavities or recesses in its sides in which are disposed rings of aerodynamic blades 18A, 18B and fluid flow passing around the annular chamber from an inlet to an outlet is caused to circulate repeatedly, flowing radially outward through the blading in the impeller cavities and radially inward in the annular side channels alongside the impeller outside the impeller cavities. Shroud rings 16A, 16B at the blade tips form cores around which this circulation takes place. The blades are cast intagrally with the impeller disc or with the shroud rings. The aerodynamic blades are designed so that the angle between the entry and exit flows of each blade is greater than 90 .
