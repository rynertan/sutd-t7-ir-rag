# Hairspray.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a hairspray product having improved hair holding properties. The hairspray composition comprises, as is usual, a solution of a hairspray resin in a suitable solvent, but to improve the holding power there is also included a minor amount of a drag reducing agent which is soluble in the solvent for the hairspray resin. The drag reducing agent is present in an amount such that the weight ratio of the hairspray resin to the drag reducing agent is 10,000 to 2 1. The drag reducing agent amounts to less than 0.3 by weight of the composition.
