# CONTROLLING DEVICE COOPERATING WITH AN ENGINE BRAKING MEANS IN A DIESEL MOTOR

## Abstract
A control circuit for co action with a vehicle engine speed control system intended for diesel motors, and in particular such a system which includes a relay 2 which when ener gized activates means for throttling the supply of fuel to the engine of said vehicle and or cuts off the discharge of exhaust gases therefrom. At a vehicle speed equal to or exceeding the given speed 70 kg hour there is produced, via means 3 an input signal 3a which is applied to a control circuit 1 , through which said signal, although only when other input signals 4a, 5a applied to said control circuit 1 indicate a state of acceptance for the activation of the relay 2 , activates means 18 incorporated in the control circuit 1 for generating a signal 2a which activates the vehicle speed control system, or relay 2 .
