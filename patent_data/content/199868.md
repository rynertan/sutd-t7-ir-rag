## Abstract
A directionally activated laser point system 25 which can be used to highlight aspects of a lecturers presentation on a screen 26 . The system is in two basic parts a hand held case of plastics material in which an optical detector is embedded, a signal amplifier with an axial hole, a laser tube and a laser tube power supply, a battery pack and compo nent interconnecting leads which are shielded to minimise interference. The second part corprises an incoherent optical transmitter 28 mounted near the screen 26 and containing an array of light emitting diodes, a pulse power supply, a plastic casing and connecting leads providing a lower voltage supply. Incoherent light 27 transmitted from the unit near the screen activates the optical detector in the hand held unit 25 . This in turn activates the laser tube to generate a laser beam which is directed from the hand held unit onto the screen 26 . The laser beam is extinguished when the hand held laser beam generator is turned towards the audience.
