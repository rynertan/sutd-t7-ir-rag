# Biochemical method for preparation of optically active carnitine.

## Abstract
L carntine is produced by bringing apocarnitine into con tact with hydrase produced by a strain of Enterobacter in an aqueous medium having a pH of 4 10 at a temperature of 20 60 C, thereby apocarnintine is converted to L carnitine.
