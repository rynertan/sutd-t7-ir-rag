# Porous thermoresin structures.

## Abstract
Porous thermoresin structures are made by at least partially solvating the thermoresin, forming the resultant mixture into a desired shape and then cooling it until droplets of the solvet form within the structure. Further cooling can crystallise the droplets. These droplets are subsequently removed to leave a porous structure.
