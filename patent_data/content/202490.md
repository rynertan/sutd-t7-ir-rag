# Method for forming a polymer image and image recording material therefor.

## Abstract
An image recording method comprising imagewise exposing to light a light sensitive material containing a light sensitive silver halide, a reducing agent capable of developing a silver halide, a polymerizable vinyl monomer, and a thermal polymerization initiator, to form a latent image of the light sensitive silver halide, and substantially uniform ly heating the exposed light sensitive material to imagewise polymerize the polymerizable vinyl monomer to form a polymer image, and an image recording material used, therefor are disclosed. The method provides a polymer image with photosensitivity comparable to conventional silver halide light sensitive materials, which requires only a dry process, for a short time, and allows for use of a reduced amount of a silver halide.
