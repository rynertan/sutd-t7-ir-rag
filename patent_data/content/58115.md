# Pressure compensated detection circuit for ion mass airflow sensor.

## Abstract
The invention is a pressure compensated circuit for an ion mass air flow sensor is disclosed. The circuit includes a feedback circuit 58 from the differential output of the sensor 10 to the regulatory input of the high voltage supply 26 . The feedback signal provides a second order correction to the output voltage of the high voltage power supply 26 . This second order correction of high voltage power supply output voltage compensates the differential output of the sensor 10 as a function of the airflow s pressure.
