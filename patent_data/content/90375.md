# ROTARY MAGNETIC HEAD DRUM DEVICE

## Abstract
A rotary magnetic head drum device of a helical scan type including rotary magnetic heads 34a and 34b , and a head drum constituted by a rotary drum 3 and a stationary drum 2 located above and below the heads in juxtaposed relation and inclined at a predetermined angle of inclination Ï‘ together with the heads. A tapering surtace 371 or a stepped surface 372 is formed at the rotary drum located over the heads and ex tends from an end of a top surface of the rotary drum to an upper end a of an outer circumferential surface D thereof to reduce the thickness of an outer peripheral portion 37 of the rotary drum, to thereby reduce the vertical dimension L of the head drum when it is located in an inclined position.
