## Description
Various prior art means have been devised to reduce current surges associated with full voltage starting of induction motors. Typically, a reduced stator voltage is first applied, then gradually increased in a series of manual steps or caused to rise automatically from said initially reduced voltage to full rated voltage during a preferred time period, i.e., in the form of a voltage increase vs. time ramp . U.S. Patent No. 4,404,511, entitled Motor Power Factor Controller with a Reduced Voltage Starter is an example of a voltage ramp type motor starter that also includes reduced load power savings means that becomes operative after a manual, i.e., arbitrarily selected, start up time period during which full power line voltage is ultimately applied to the stator windings regardless of actual start up requirement . As is common practice of the general prior art with reduced voltage motor start means, said patent neither incorporates nor anticipates protection against power source anomalies or overcurrent protection of the stator winding from locked rotor events during motor start up or later . U.S. Patent No. 4,086,406 entitled Chiller Controls is an example of another arbitrarily timed ramp type reduced voltage motor starter that includes means for stator overcurrent protection and AC power source anomalies, but does not incorporate means to later improve motor operating efficiency by adjusting input voltage as a function of load demand. Said motor protection functions are very complex and based upon wholly different concepts and circuit implementation means than the present invention. Taken together, the above cited art is representative of the fundamental concepts and practices employed by the general prior art for electronic motor start control and stator overcurrent protection means. In the instance of motor start control, said prior art may be characterised as slowly increasing the magnitude of stator input voltage from a reduced level to full power line voltage as a function of time passage, wherein said time factor is arbitrarily selectable or comprises a preferred time duration predetermined by design, but, in any event, is not controllingly responsive to individual electro mechanical characteristics of the motor actually being controlled and its actual load of a moment. In the instance of stator overcurrent protection, the prior art may be characterised as being controllingly responsive to alternation current peaks or the average of RMS current flow into the stator winding and or temperature rise therein for a predetermined or manually selected time period. Prior art power source protection for power source anomalies typically rely upon a multiplicity of electronic comparators and complicated circuit arrangements. Arbitrarily timed stator voltage ramp type start control means often result in unreliable starting, motor system instability, unnecessary power waste and motor heating during excessively slow acceleration, and or significant vibration during some portion of the motor start up period. Likewise, they routinely permit the flow of excessive stator current and waste substantial electric power since typically reduced start up motor loads seldom require the full AC power source voltage which is ultimately coupled at the termination of their reduced voltage motor start up time period. Effective but nuisance free operation of stator RMS current overprotection means that respond to alternation peaks above a particular threshold is seldom realised with electronically reduced voltage starter means due to alternation crest factors and power source, phase related transient stator inrush currents associated with switched partial sine waves produced thereby. In U.S. Patent No. 4,297,628 entitled Energy Economizer for Induction Motors , there is disclosed AC power saving means which utilises certain characteristics of stator inrush current related by natural motor properties to rotor mechanical load magnitude and the efficiency with which electric energy is converted into mechanical energy thereby to cause an induction motor to operate with minimum input power from zero to maximum rated load. This prior U.S. Patent 4,297,628 describes stator current demodulating means for an energy saving stator power control system employing wave modifier means suitable for single phase induction motors. Said prior patent also references U.S. Patent No. 4,242,625 entitled Energy Economizer for Polyphase Induction Motors which discloses an arrangement of the same general type employing two wave modifiers which may be responsive to motor load detection means of the current demodulator type thereby to provide load efficiency related control of AC power input to a three phase motor. The object of the inventions of U.S. Patents 4,297,628 and 4,242,625 was to provide AC power control means responsive to an induction motor s natural load efficiency related characteristics thereby to enable said characteristics to maintain near optimum motor efficiency from zero to maximum rated mechanical load with low, nominal or high power source voltage by varying stator input power in proportion to workload requirement. However, those prior inventions do not provide motor start up energy saving, start current surge reduction, protection against power source anomalies, or overcurrent protection for the stator winding s from a locked rotor event during or after motor start up. However, it is known that when full power line voltage is applied to start a motor, stator current surges from five to eight times normal operating current subject the motor to severe electro mechanical stress, is wasteful of electrical power even when a motor is free to start normally, and will quickly cause permanent stator winding damage if the motor driven mechanism jams during start up or stops rotation any time thereafter. It is also known that thermally activated circuit breakers typically prevent catastrophic, immediate motor failure, but allow some degree of permanent winding damage which shortens a motor s useful life when a locked rotor event or power source anomaly occurs. The present invention comprises significant improvement in the art of induction motor starting and includes means for 3 motor protection from excessively high or low power source voltage, phase loss, and severe overload, including locked rotor events, which occur during or subsequent to motor start up. While the present invention relates generally to the field of power input controls for induction motors, it specifically relates to a motor current demodulating type power saving controller and further provides controlled current starting by reduction of input voltage and stator winding protection from start up phase loss and or prolonged operation with input current substantially greater than rated full load magnitude due to locked rotor conditions or power source anomalies. The present invention avoids various difficulties, limitations, energy waste, and nuisance aspects of prior art induction motor start and protection means by practical application of the fundamentally new concepts concerning stator input power control and novel circuit means for monitoring performance related stator initial inrush current characteristics first disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,297,628. As will be described later, stator power control relies upon processing and control use of short duration microseconds voltage pulses whose characteristics are related by natural motor properties to rotor speed slip , motor load, power conversion efficiency and stator current peak amplitude during each power source alternation. According to the present invention, there is provided a power control system comprising an AC induction motor having a rotor and stator windings, a sine wave power supply for energizing said stator windings to effect rotation of said rotor, a motor current demodulator for monitoring load responsive parameters of inrush current to said stator windings each time said current increases from zero magnitude, said motor current demodulator being operative to generate system control signals as a function of natural motor properties, and control devices responsive to said control signals from said motor current demodulator for controlling the energization supplied by said power supply to said stator windings by varying the portion of each sine wave which is coupled from said power supply to said stator windings, characterized by said motor current demodulator being a three phase motor current demodulator that includes means for converting rotor slip properties to initial inrush current magnitude and efficiency related control signals, a manually settable means for selecting a maximum value of motor starting torque during a start mode of operation, means for deactivating amplifiers associated with said motor current demodulator during said start mode, DC control voltage means responsive to said manual means for limiting the maximum current coupled to said stator windings from said power supply during said start mode to assure rotor torque does not exceed said selected maximum torque during said start mode, and means responsive to motor speed reaching near synchronous speed for switching said power control system from said start mode to a run mode wherein said motor current demodulator and associated circuits, independent of said manual means, cooperate to control the magnitude of current coupled by said control devices from said power supply to said stator windings near synchronous speed in response to load demand imposed on said rotor or, in a locked rotor event during said run mode, responsive to processing circuits to activate circuit means which inhibit said current flow from said power supply. In carrying the invention into effect a standard AC may have its stator energised from a sine wave power source through one wave modifier or two wave modifiers in the instance of a three phase motor, operative to vary the portion of each cycle of said sine wave which is coupled from the power source to the stator winding s . Said wave modifier s may be of the type discussed in U.S. Patent No. 4,242,625 or as in the energy economizer technology integrated circuit EET IC which implements the invention embodiments described herein. Said wave modifier s may be responsive to added circuit means, manual adjustments and electric signals developed by monitoring stator initial inrush current characteristics which communicate the state of the motor i.e., energized or de energized . Said added circuit means cooperate with an energy economizer type stator current monitoring means and said EET IC thereby to provide an induction motor power control system with two energy saving operating modes and two protection modes . The two operating modes are motor start up and motor run. Each operating mode has an associated protection mode adapted to prevent stator winding damage by response to potentially damaging conditions during motor start up and or later running. More specifically, during a motor start up mode, the energy saving control circuit portion of the stator current demodulator means within the EET IC is inhibited and phase angle delayed coupling of partial source voltage alternations produces an RMS stator voltage magnitude subject to manual selection of a preferred maximum RMS starting current. Assuming the rotor shaft is free to commence rotation, the motor starts to accelerate at said preferred reduced voltage and controlled current magnitude. Circuit means responsive to stator current characteristics related by natural motor properties to rotor speed maintain the present invention control system in said start mode until said characteristics indicate the motor has accelerated to near synchronous speed whereat, in response to said speed indication, said circuit means shifts said control system to a run mode wherein stator voltage magnitude is controlled by rotor load demand of a moment. Thus, in accordance wih the teaching of the present invention, time duration of a motor start up mode and the voltage magnitude coupled to the stator are subject to the reality of prevailing conditions rather than an arbitrarily selected time duration imposed by artificial means that ultimately applies full power line voltage regardless of actual motor load demand. More particularly, when the rotor is free to rotate, the present invention start up mode time duration and applied stator voltage magnitude is primarily determined by However, in the event the rotor shaft is jammed a locked rotor condition and cannot start rotation or continue rotating while in the start up mode, the start mode protection means, after a manually selected time delay, will terminate an in process motor start up mode by inhibiting said wave modifier s . The control system will remain in an AC power inhibit mode until the main power source switch is turned off. When AC power is re applied, a new start up mode will be activated. Thus, even if the motor is starting with controlled input current limited to approximately full load rating, the start up mode will automatically shift to an AC power inhibit mode at the conclusion of a previously selected period if the motor cannot accelerate normally. In other words failure of a motor to accelerate to a near synchronous speed with full load or higher current in a particular time period is recognised as a potentially damaging condition and sufficient cause to inhibit AC input power even if the stator winding s has have not yet been subjected to overheating by excessive current flow. After rotor start up is achieved, and said control system has shifted to a run mode , run mode protection means is enabled but remains inactive while stator input power is matched to load demand by stator current demodulation type means of U.S. Patent No. 4,242,625. During rated load range operation, therefore, near optimum motor operating efficiency is maintained. However, in the instance of a locked rotor event, said run mode protection means will nearly instantly terminate the previous run mode by inhibiting said wave modifier s and assume an AC power inhibit mode until the main power source switch is turned off. When the main switch is re energised, said control will assume a controlled current start up mode . If the locked rotor condition prevails, the start up mode will terminate as previously described if the rotor is free to rotate, said control system will automatically shift to its energy saving run mode when the rotor has accelerated to near synchronous speed. 3 power source input voltage and current is monitored for potentially damaging amplitude variations or phase loss. If an input power line becomes open circuited i.e., phase loss , stator power is inhibited within one power source cycle. Stator input power is also inhibited if source voltage rises or falls substantially, e.g., in excess of plus twenty or minus sixty five percent of nominal rating. As described below, with reference to the accompanying drawings, an embodiment of the present invention comprises means for induction motor start control and stator winding protection that is wholly different from the known prior art in fundamental concept, practice and implementation means. In the drawings To assist understanding the present invention, the basis for development of load proportional power control signals from natural characteristics of current flow between a sine wave AC power source and an induction motor stator will first be discussed. Particular load efficiency related characteristics are illustrated by Figures 7A and 7B. For descriptive purposes, current rise from zero magnitude Figure 7A dotted circle is designated stator inrush current abbreviated I Figure 6 is a simplified equivalent circuit for an induction motor, and shows that stator current magnitude at every moment is the vector sum of inductive and resistive components resulting from motor inductance and rotor mechanical load respectively. These current components exhibit particular characteristics during the I Figure 7A depicts stator current alternations at various rotor loads, and shows that stator current magnitude during each alternation becomes proportional to rotor load demand when stator input voltage is adjusted for highest motor efficiency, i.e., it increases when load increases, and vice versa. Examining events within the dotted circle of Figure 7A reveals that I During the I For the above reasons, an efficiency referenced signal may be developed from I The energy saving arrangement of U.S. Patent No. 4,297,628 relies upon the load efficiency related characteristics of I As noted earlier I In U.S. Patent No. 4,297,628 I More specifically, if said closed loop control means is initially referred to I It will be appreciated from the foregoing discussion that stator inrush current is related by motor slip properties to rotor speed. Therefore, I Referring to Figures 1 and 3, like numerals of which refer to like elements, a standard three phase AC induction motor 11 is provided with stator windings 13, 14 and 15 and a rotor having a shaft 12 adapted to be coupled to a load. A three phase AC power source 300 is normally coupled directly to stator windings 13, 14 and 15 via connections that are represented by solid lines 19 and 19A, and broken lines 301 and 301A solid lines 18 and 18A, and broken lines 302 and 302A solid lines 17 and 17A, and broken line 303, respectively. In accordance with the present invention, this normal energisation circuit is interrupted, and power source 300, instead of being coupled directly to stator windings 13, 14 and 15, is connected instead as at 19, to a primary terminal of a current sample transformer assembly 6, the other primary terminal of which is connected via line 19A to one side of a solid state power switch assembly 10 whose other side is connected, via line 19B, to stator winding 13 as at 18, to a primary terminal of a current sample transformer assembly 7, the other primary terminal of which is connected via line 18A to one side of a solid state power switch assembly 9 whose other side is connected, via line 18B, to stator winding 14 and as at 17, to a primary terminal of a current sample transformer assembly 8, the other primary terminal of which is connected via line 17A to stator winding 15. Switch assemblies 9 and 10 may comprise, for example, Triac assemblies, or silicon controlled rectifier assemblies, with associated gate trigger amplifier and trigger coupling transformer circuitry as shown in Figure 5. Said thyristor type power switch assemblies are responsive to the pulse train outputs of respective wave modifier assemblies contained within the custom integrated circuit 1 EET IC1 . Said wave modifiers can take the form shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,190,793, or comprise an integrated circuit version thereof as found in EET IC1 of the present invention. In either case, the operation of said wave modifiers is controlled by a DC control voltage first appearing on line 46A and then on lines 500 and 501, the outputs of emitter followers 50 and 52, whose common input from line 46A may be, under one condition, a function of the load on, or the operating efficiency of, motor 11, and in another condition be determined by manual adjustment of start current ADJ potentiometer 211. As explained later, wave modifier operation may, under certain conditions, also be responsive to a DC voltage coupled to pin 6 of EET IC1 or inhibited until AC power is first removed then restored for motor protection reasons by momentary application of a DC voltage to pin 18 of EET IC1. More particularly, and as noted above, the primaries of current sample transformer assemblies 6, 7 and 8 are connected in series with one of the stator input power lines such as 19A, 18A and 17A as shown in Figure 4. Current sample transformer assemblies are shown by Figure 4 to consist of a saturable core transformer with a primary winding and a center tapped secondary winding connected to diodes 861 and 862 in a conventional full wave rectifier arrangement. A voltage pulse of relatively short duration microseconds derived from stator winding initial inrush current passing through said primary winding is generated across the secondary winding of said saturable core transformers each time said inrush current reverses its direction of flow in other words, when stator current first rises from a previous zero magnitude . The output of said rectifier diodes, therefore, consists of positive pulses regardless of the actual flow direction of stator inrush current. The various individual characteristics of said voltage pulses such as their risetime, amplitude, duration and absolute time of occurrence, vary in response to the magnitude and waveform of the applied voltage, the momentary mechanical load on the motor and inherent electro mechanical properties peculiar to the motor, e.g., torque load speed slip properties. The energy saving aspects of the present system when the motor is running with loads between zero and maximum rating conform to those described in U.S. Patent No. 4,297,628 and briefly reviewed above. The circuits contained within the blocks identified in Figures 1 and 3 as motor load pulse processing 2, start mode processing 3 and DC control voltage processing 5 cooperate with the internal circuitry of EET IC1 and start current ADJ 211 to command a controlled current, reduced voltage start up mode of operation when the output of AC power source 300 is first switched to the power input terminals of the present invention and, after motor 11 reaches near synchronous speed, command a run mode operation thereafter. In response to signal input from motor load pulse processing 2, and in further cooperation with internal circuitry of EET IC1, protection processing 4 provides different start up mode and run mode AC power inhibit motor protection actions. Operation of the start up , run and associated protection modes is described below with frequent reference to Figure 1, a system block diagram of the present invention arrangement, Figure 3, a schematic of the signal processing circuits external to EET IC1 custom integrated circuit , and Figure 4, which illustrates typical operating waveforms developed by sample transformer assemblies 6, 7 and 8. To assist understanding overall system operation of the present invention, EET IC1 internal operation will be summarised first. Refer to Figure 2, a simplified block diagram of the energy economizer technology custom integrated circuit EET IC1 which identifies its six functional elements. Block 600, current demodulator amplifiers, converts summed bias inputs from ST1, ST2 and DC power supply 16 into a pulse of constant amplitude whose width is proportional to rotor mechanical workload when the motor runs near synchronous speed. Block 601, start mode switches, is activated by charging action through pin 5 by capacitor 203 of start mode processing 3 when AC power is first applied. Said activation plus voltage at pin 5 causes pin 7 output of block 601 to pull low, which action inhibits block 600 via line 606 and accelerates command signal input to pin 6 via line 607. Activation of block 601 commands EET IC1 and associated circuitry into a start up mode . Block 602, DC voltage regulators, develop a regulated plus seven and plus fourteen volts for internal EET IC1 use from an external voltage coupled to pin 20 and couples plus fourteen volts to pin 4 for use by external circuitry. Block 603, AC power inhibit latch, inhibits thyristor trigger outputs from blocks 604 and 605 wave modifiers 1 and 2 when a plus voltage inhibit command is applied to pin 18 and couples a plus voltage output on pin 17 when commanded to inhibit condition . The circuit of block 603 comprises a positive feedback arrangement whereby a momentary plus voltage on pin 18 latches block 603 into an inhibit state until DC input power on pin 20 is removed. When in an inhibit state, block 603 prevents the generation of thyristor triggers and, therefore, AC power coupling by associated thyristors to motor 11 is inhibited. Blocks 604 and 605, wave modifiers 1 and 2, are identical circuits which generate thyristor type triggers in response to plus input voltage on pins 16 and 15 respectively. Generation of said triggers are further controllable by power source 300 voltage alternation bias applied to zero cross bias pins 14 and 19 via DC power supply 16 and plus voltage when if applied to accelerate pin 6. System operation during a start up mode will now be examined with reference to Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4. When 3 power source 300 is first applied to lines 17, 18 and 19, capacitor 203 draws charging current from EET IC1 pin 5 as DC power supply 16 terminal A rises to its nominal magnitude of approximately 27 volts. This action causes start mode switches 601 see Figure 2 to conduct which, in turn, causes EET IC1 internal lines 606 and 607 and external pin 7 to pull low, i.e., to near ground potential. Said charging action of capacitor 203 comprises a start mode command to EET IC1 pin 5. Therefore, EET IC1 and associated circuitry assume the following seven start mode conditions. To assist understanding system operation in the start up mode, the circuit means by which solid state switch gate trigger outputs from EET IC1 pins 3 and 13 are controlled will now be described. EET IC1 Figure 2 contains two identical wave modifiers, 604 and 605, each of which has five possible inputs Figure 3 shows that trigger timing at pins 1 and 12 is provided by capacitors 1E and 1H respectively said capacitors cooperate with components within wave modifiers 604 and 605 thereby to establish gate trigger pulse width and repetition frequency. The gate triggers are generated when the DC control voltage at pins 16 and 15 exceeds a particular threshold but are inhibited slightly before, during and slightly after 3 AC power source voltage zero crossings on line 18 and 19 by DC power supply 16 supply of appropriately phased zero cross bias to pins 14 and 19. Resistors 53, 57 and capacitors 56 and 58 in DC control voltage processing 5 cooperate with components within EET IC1 and said zero cross bias at pins 14 and 19 to cause the DC control voltage supplied on lines 50A and 52A to assume a sawtooth ramp type waveformat lines 500 and 501, pins 16 and 15 of Figures 1 and 3. Referring to the waveform illustrations at the upper left of Figure 1, note that the time delay after AC power source 300 zero crossings before the DC control voltage ramp reaches the threshold shown as dotted line 505 where gate triggers are generated decreases when DC control voltage magnitude increases, and vice versa. It can thus be seen that the phase angle delay from voltage zero crossing at which gate trigger outputs appear at pins 3 and 13 is dependent upon the amplitude of the DC control voltage on lines 50A and 52A of Figure 2 and said gate trigger generation threshold 505. During run mode operation with a steady, or slowly increasing motor load, said DC control voltage amplitude is a load efficiency related function of rotor slip and said gate trigger generation threshold is fixed by the internal circuit arrangement of EET IC1. However, with certain load increases, a corresponding analog voltage appears at accelerate pin 6 for reasons which will be described later. It suffices here to note that below a particular magnitude, plus DC voltage applied to pin 6 serves to proportionally lower said gate trigger generation threshold line 505 of Figure 1 , thereby to decrease the phase angle delay in generating said triggers. Above said particular magnitude, pin 6 assumes a priority condition and said gate triggers are continuously generated even during voltage zero crossings . Wave modifier input 4, via line 608 which is common to both wave modifiers see Figure 2 , is an internal positive voltage output of AC power inhibit latch 602 within EET IC1 generated in response to an inhibit command applied to EET IC1 pin 18. Said positive voltage on line 608 stops wave modifiers 604 and 605 generation of gate triggers regardless of voltage inputs to pin 6 accelerate , 15, 16 DC control voltage of EET IC1. When said wave modifiers are inhibited as described, solid state switches 9 and 10 receive no gate triggers and thus couple no AC power to stator windings 13 and 14 of motor 11. Description of system operation of the present invention during a start up mode now resumes with reference to Figures 1 and 3. Recall that charging action of capacitor 203 commanded EET IC1 to a start mode that established seven particular circuit conditions. The controlled current aspect of start mode operation established by conditions 1, 5, 6 and 7 is described first. Refer to Figure 3. Start mode condition 1 causes capacitors 42 and 46 of DC control voltage processing 5 to begin charging through EET IC1 pin 11 towards a maximum positive voltage subject to voltage divider action of fixed resistor 210 and start current ADJ variable resistor 211 whose terminal 211A has been referenced to ground by start condition 5. In other words, said maximum positive voltage coupled to movable arm 49B of start current balance potentiometer 49 via line 46A becomes any operator selectable DC control voltage of a preferred magnitude. By virtue of potentiometer 49 activated to provide voltage division by a ground reference of condition 6 , said DC control voltage coupled from line 46A through emitter followers 50 and 52 via associated components in their emitters to EET IC1 pin 15 wave modifier 1 and 16 wave modifier 2 may be adjusted to cause equal start current flow in stator windings 13 and 14. Capacitor 48 permanently connected from the base of emitter follower 50 to ground and 43 connected from the base of emitter follower 52 to ground during start mode operation by condition 7 introduce a delay in the DC control voltage rise to said operator selected value. Taken together, the charging delay of capacitors 42, 46, 43 and 48 produce a gradual increasing, i.e., a ramp type , DC control voltage whose rate of rise and ultimate amplitude is set by start current ADJ 211. Because of the foregoing, solid state switches 9 and 10 initially couple reduced current to stator windings 13 and 14 that gradually rises with the passage of time to a preferred maximum and the torque of motor 11, therefore, correspondingly increases in a like manner. If the operator preferred controlled current torque maximum is sufficient to overcome inertial load start requirements, motor 11 begins rotation and accelerates to near synchronous speed whereat start mode processing 3 automatically shifts EET IC1 into a run mode. In said run mode, said DC control voltage magnitude becomes a subsequent function of rotor load requirement. In the event that the operator selected start current is inadequate to accelerate motor 11 to near synchronous speed or a locked rotor event occurs during motor start up, protection processing 4 will, after a manually selected time delay, activate AC power inhibit latch 603 through EET IC1 pin 18 Figure 2 . Immediately thereafter, solid state switches 9 and 10 cease conducting current into stator windings 13 and 14. The dual mode operation of protection processing 4 will be described later. It is adequate here to note that failure of motor 11 to accelerate to near synchronous speed in a reasonable time period due to inadequate operator start current selection or a locked rotor event activates a start mode protection action which terminates the previous start up mode . The controlled current aspect of the present invention start up mode described above may now be summarised. Refer to Figure 3. When AC power source 300 is first coupled switched on , charging action of capacitor 203 of start mode processing 4 commands EET IC1 and associated external circuitry into a particular set of conditions. Four of said conditions cooperate to produce a DC control voltage at line 46A that Since applied stator power corresponds to said DC control voltage of line 49A, motor 11 starts with operator selected, reduced stator voltage and current magnitude first controlled by said operator selection until motor 11 reaches near synchronous speed, whereafter said stator current magnitude and applied voltage is subject to power saving load efficiency control achieved by the practice of energy economizer technology EET , previously described. To assist understanding the later description of start mode processing 3 and protection processing 4 action, their common input signal coupled by line 802 output from motor load processing 1 which commands their operation will be described first. Refer to the waveform illustrations of Figure 4. Solid line waveform 803 is developed by stator current flow through the primary of sample transformers 6, 7 and 8 after full wave rectification by representative diodes 861 and 862 when motor 11 is operating at zero empty shaft load. Voltage pulses exponential discharge between AC power source 300 alternations is a result of components connected to lines 17B, 18C and 19C which are located in motor load pulse processing 2 as shown in Figure 3. The waveform voltages shown in Figure 4 are representative and reflect a choice of components and design convenience, i.e., they are not inherent limitations nor intended as a specification. They were measured during operation of a model constructed in accordance with the present invention. During typical load range operation of motor 11, the peak amplitude of waveform 803 varies between lines 805 and 806 in accordance with the resistive component of stator current induced by rotor load of a moment. However, when rotor slip is significantly greater than when motor 11 is running efficiently, e.g., during start up acceleration of motor 11, the peak amplitude of waveform 803 increases above line 800 in proportion to said slip increase. In the instance of a locked rotor event, said peak amplitude rises substantially higher than during normal operation as illustrated by dotted waveform 804. In other words, the amplitude of the waveform output of sample transformers 6, 7 and 8 may be viewed as a signal means which is unfailingly generated by induction motor slip properties that inherently communicate whether motor 11 is Recall that at the moment input power is first applied to start an induction motor, its rotor is at rest. Therefore, until rotation actually begins, a locked rotor condition effectively exists. During subsequent start up acceleration, rotor slip decreases until it arrives at a load related near synchronous speed. Refer now to Figure 3. For the above reasons, the waveform peak amplitude connected by line 17B to circuitry within motor load pulse processing 2 at all times communicates the dynamic condition of motor 11. For example, when partial sine wave voltage is first applied to stator windings 14 and 15 via solid state switch 9, current begins flowing through ST3 ASSY 8, ST2 ASSY 7, and said stator windings. The resulting waveform peak amplitude on lines 17B and 18C initially communicates a locked rotor condition. Assuming rotor acceleration begins, said peak amplitudes steadily decreases as motor 11 approaches near synchronous speed. Referring still to Figure 3, note that the cathodes of 47 volt zener diodes 20 and 21 connect to line 17B and 18C respectively and their anodes to the base electrode of emitter follower 25. Referring to Figure 4, observe that the 47 volt zener conduction threshold designated as line 800 is higher than the peak amplitude variation of waveform 803 realised during typical load range operation lines 805 and 806 of motor 11. Thus, during routine load range operation, zener diodes 20 and 21 couple no portion of waveform 803 to emitter follower 25. However, as previously noted, during a locked rotor condition e.g., the instant of motor start up , waveform 803 peak amplitude rises substantially above the conduction threshold line 800 of zener diode 20 and 21. Therefore, during motor start up, until motor 11 accelerates to a near synchronous speed, the portion of peak amplitude above line 300 of waveform 803 is coupled to the base electrode of emitter follower 25 and, in turn, to line 802. Said portion of waveform 803 is increased from tens to hundreds of microseconds by action of capacitor 24 and becomes a control signal input to motor load pulse processing 2. Description of system operation of the present invention during a start up mode resumes with reference to Figure 3. Recall that when AC power is first applied, charging action of capacitor 203 couples positive voltage to pin 5 which commands EET IC1 to a start mode that causes pin 7 to pull low to ground and establishes seven particular conditions. Continuation of the start mode processing aspect established by condition 3, which depends upon events produced by conditions 1, 5, 6 and 7 controlled current aspect commands , is examined next. Refer to Figure 3. Recall that condition 3 was described as enabling start mode hold switch transistor 204 emitter collector conduction of signals on line 802 to EET IC1 pin 5 by connecting its base electrode to ground through resistor 208, isolating diode 209 and internal conduction of EET IC1 elements connected to pin 7. The circuit elements of start mode processing 3, not yet examined, will now be discussed. Reverse bias resistor 201 connected between the base emitter of start mode hold switch transitor 204 insures turn off of transistor 204 when EET IC1 is not in a start up mode. Resistor 205 provides a discharge path for capacitors 203, connected between DC power supply terminal A and the junction of transistor 204 s collector and EET IC1 pin 5, and 207, connected between ground and the junction of transistor 204 s collector and EET IC1 pin 5. As previously noted, when AC power is first applied, capacitor 203 couples the rising positive voltage of DC power supply terminal A to EET IC1 pin 5, which action comprises a system start up mode command. Capacitor 207 performs multiple functions as follows Referring to Figure 3, consider now the series of events that occur after AC power source 300 is first switched on to lines 17, 18 and 19 The start mode processing aspect of the present invention may now be summarised. Refer to Figure 3. Start mode processing 4 commences operation when AC power source 300 is switched to lines 17, 18 and 19. More specifically, capacitor 203 couples the rising positive voltage of AC power supply 16 terminal A to the junction of start mode hold switch transistor 204 collector, one lead of resistor 205 and capacitor 207 whose other leads are grounded and EET IC1 pin 5. EET IC1 recognises the positive voltage coupled by capacitor 203 as a start mode turn on command and, therefore, establishes a particular set of start mode conditions internally and externally. One said start up condition enables turns on start mode hold switch 204. Appearance of rotor slip produced control pulses which result from controlled current start up of motor 11 on line 802, are coupled through start mode hold switch 204, integrated by capacitor 207 to a continuous positive DC voltage applied by parallel connection to EET IC1 pin 5. When said rotor slip pulses cease appearing on line 802, which typically signifies motor 11 has accelerated to near synchronous speed, capacitor 207 discharges below the start mode command threshold of EET IC1 pin 5. At this moment, EET IC1 assumes a run mode condition, start mode hold switch transistor 204 s base electrode ceases to be grounded through EET IC1 pin 7 and transistor 204 turns off, effectively disconnecting line 802 from the balance of start mode processing 3 circuitry. Thus, subsequent rotor slip induced pulses which may briefly appear on line 802 during certain run mode conditions are not integrated by capacitor 207 nor coupled to EET IC1 pin 5 and, therefore, cannot re command EET IC1 to a start up mode. If motor start up does not occur because of a locked rotor condition, start mode hold control signal pulses on line 802 will cease when EET IC1 wave modifiers are inhibited by action of protection processing 4 which is described later. The start mode protection aspect established by condition 4 in cooperation with condition 3 start mode processing enabling command and conditions 1, 5, 6 and 7 controlled current aspect commands is examined next. Recall that rotor slip induced control signal pulses begin appearing on line 802, the command signal input to protection processing 4 and start mode processing 3, shortly after AC power is switched to lines 17, 18 and 19 from AC power source 300 . Recall further that capacitor 207 of start mode processing 3 is connected to line 802 by start mode only conduction of start mode hold switch transistor 204. Thus, during start mode operation, said control signal pulses are integrated by capacitor 207, and the command signal of line 802 becomes a corresponding DC voltage level. Examining the circuit of protection processing 4, note that there are two charging paths from command signal line 802 to AC power inhibit delay capacitor 101. The path from line 802 through resistor 102 and diode 103 to capacitor 101 comprises the run mode AC power inhibit command path, and the path through AC power inhibit delay variable resistor 100 is the start mode inhibit command path. Finally, recall that start mode condition 4 inhibits the run mode charging path to AC power inhibit delay capacitor 101 by pulling the junction of resistor 102 and the anode terminal of diode 103 to ground through diode 106, line 902 and internal conduction of internal elements of EET IC1 connected to pin 7. With the foregoing in mind, it can be seen that the delay of capacitor 101 in charging to the threshold level at which EET IC1 pin 18 activates AC power inhibit latch 603 internal to EET IC1 as shown on Figure 2 is a dual function of the rotor slip induced signal commanded DC voltage level on line 802 and the manually selectable resistance of AC power inhibit delay resistance 100. Said inhibit command time delay may, therefore, be adjusted to allow motor 11 ample time to smoothly accelerate its typical starting load to a near synchronous speed in an efficient manner, yet terminate the start up mode if motor 11 does not, or cannot, start properly. For example, if operator selected controlled current provides inadequate starting torque, or a locked rotor condition prevails when starting is attempted, or the motor driven load mechanism jams during start up acceleration, the charge on capacitor 101 will rise to the inhibit command threshold level and terminate start mode operation by inhibiting gate trigger turn on commands to solid state switches 9 and 10. In other words, the present invention start mode protection arrangement may be summarised as preventing exessive input current to motor 11 otherwise resulting from Before description of run mode protection operation, the characteristics and processing of rotor slip related voltage pulses that appear on line 802 under certain conditions will be re examined and discussed. Refer to the stator current sample transformer output waveforms of Figure 4. The amplitude and width of control signal pulses ultimately appearing on line 802 are essentially proportional to the portion of waveform 804 that rises above the zener diode 20 conduction threshold line 800 which, in turn, is proportional to rotor slip of the moment. In other words, a locked rotor event that occurs when motor 11 is running causes substantially higher amplitude, wider pulses on line 802 than, for example, pulses produced if a heavy or over load is suddenly applied while running with energy saving reduced voltage at zero load e.g., clutch coupled load applications. In the instance of a locked rotor event, for protection purposes it is desirable to remove input power from motor 11 immediately. However, if sudden application of a rated load, or moderate overload, causes a motor 11 previously idling at reduced voltage to conserve energy to experience excessive rotor slip, it is desirable to quickly raise applied stator voltage and re accelerate motor 11 to a new load related speed of optimum efficiency. In the present invention, the rotor slip induced signal output simultaneously commands EET IC1 through motor load pulse processing 2 and protection processing 4 via line 802 to perform the appropriate desired action during run mode operation. Refer to Figure 3 and note that line 802 connects the control output of emitter follower 25 whose signal input is rotor slip induced pulses from ST2 ASSY 7 and ST3 ASSY 8 to EET IC1 accelerate pin 6 through resistor 30 and AC power inhibit pin 18 through the circuitry of protection processing 4. The character of the control signal appearing on line 802 is caused to be different during start and run modes by cooperative action of start mode processing 3 circuitry and internal elements in EET IC1. More specifically, during start mode operation, integration of rotor slip induced pulses appearing on line 802 into a corresponding DC voltage level was previously specified when emitter collector conduction of start mode hold switch transistor 204 connects the ungrounded terminal of capacitor 207 to line 802. However, as also previously mentioned, transistor 204 is held nonconducting by reverse bias resistor 201 during run mode operation. Thus, during run mode , the control signal of line 802, when present, comprises pulses during each power source current alternation whose amplitude and width are related by induction motor properties to rotor slip of the moment. In the light of the foregoing review of the nature of the control signal when it appears on line 802 during run mode operation, description of the response of motor load pulse processing 2 and protection processing 4 to said signal resumes. Assume a condition wherein motor 11 is running with an empty rotor shaft 12 i.e., zero load near synchronous speed with minimun input power due to the power saving reduction of stator voltage control action of the energy economizer, current demodulator portion of the present invention. Assume now an extreme performance demand condition wherein a moderate overload is suddenly clutch coupled to rotor shaft 12. Because motor 11 stator voltage is substantially lower than required to deliver even five percent of full load torque, rotor slip will begin to increase with each successive alternation of power source 300. In the first moments after said load application, increasing amplitude of the load efficiency related control signal input to motor load pulse processing 2 on line 18C output of ST2 ASSY 7 causes the current demodulator amplifiers 600 in EET IC1 to begin increasing the DC control voltage appearing on line 46A of DC control voltage processing 5. Therefore, phase angle delay of gate trigger generation decreases, and motor 11 stator voltage begins rising. However, relatively long integration time constants of circuit elements between EET IC1 pin 11 and line 46A necessary for optimum system stability prevent an extremely rapid rise in DC control voltage. Thus, with the step function , heavy load demand assumed for discussion purposes, the rate of DC control voltage rise is inadequate and rotor slip increase continues. Thus, during the same few power source alternations, rotor slip induced control pulses appear at the output of emitter follower 25 and are coupled via line 802 to a resistor 30 in motor load pulse processing 2 and components in protection processing 4 and start mode processing 3 whose response will be described later . Said control pulses whose amplitude and width increases with each power source alternation as rotor slip increases are coupled through one end of resistor 30, charging capacitor 31 which is connected between ground and the junction of the other end of resistor 30 and EET IC1 accelerate pin 6. Recall that during the previous description of wave modifier portions of EET IC1 it was noted that below a particular magnitude, plus voltage on pin 6 lowers the gate trigger generation threshold of said wave modifiers illustrated by line 505 of Figure 1 and decreases phase angle delay of said trigger generation. Said action serves to accelerate the rate of increase in stator voltage coupled by solid state switches 9 and 10 to motor 11 beyond that produced by the rate of DC control voltage rise on line 46A commanded by current demodulator amplifiers 600 in EET IC1. In other words, with the assumed load demand, as the DC control voltage rises or line 46A, increasing positive voltage at pin 6 produced by the rotor slip control pulses on line 802 charging capacitor 31 causes the gate trigger generation threshold to fall simultaneously, and this accelerates the rate of increase in application of stator voltage to motor 11. With a stator voltage increase, line 802 control pulse amplitude and width proportionally increase, further accelerating the rate of decrease in gate trigger phase angle delay, i.e., increasing positive voltage at pin 6 acts as rotor slip positive feedback. Within a few more power source alternations, motor 11 stator voltage rises sufficiently to develop the higher torque required by the new load demand. As motor 11 accelerates, rotor slip quickly decreases and said excessive slip generated control pulses cease appearing on line 802. Capacitor 31, therefore, discharges and EET IC1 current demodulator amplifiers 600 resume load proportional control of motor 11 stator voltage. The present invention response to an assumed extreme load demand coupled to motor 11 while running at energy saving, reduced stator voltage may now be summarized. First, note that while protection processing 4 circuitry also received rotor slip induced signals on common line 802, no inhibit command to EET IC1 developed. Although the assumed sudden load condition was extreme, it was not sufficient to require protective action for motor 11. The circuit response of protection processing 4 in this instance will be fully examined when locked rotor protection is later described. Motor load processing 2 s response to the above assumed condition was twofold EET IC1 s response to the above described control inputs from motor load pulse processing 2 quickly raised motor 11 stator voltage to the full sine wave power required by the assumed moderate overload applied as a step function load increase. Run mode protection is described below. Refer to Figure 3. Protection processing 4 is continuously responsive to control signal pulses when they are caused to appear on line 802 by induction motor rotor slip properties. Note there are parallel paths by which said control pulses may charge AC power inhibit delay capacitor 101 to the inhibit command threshold of EET IC1 pin 18. The run mode path, through resistor 102 and diode 103, is inhibited during motor 11 start up acceleration. However, when motor 11 reaches near synchronous speed, the EET IC1 shifts to run mode operation, both paths are enabled and capacitor 101 may be charged through variable resistor 100 directly and resistor 102 through diode 103. Resistor 102 is selected to have substantially lower resistance than the maximum resistance of variable resistor 100, reducing capacitor 101 charge time during run mode operation. Recall that during run mode operation, capacitor 207 of start mode processing 3 is not switched to line 802 by start mode hold switch 204 and, therefore, line 802 control pulses are not integrated into a DC voltage equivalent during run mode. For this reason, capacitor 101 is duty cycle charged during successive alternation periods wherein rotor slip induces control pulses to appear on line 802. That is, capacitor 101 charges in accordance with line 802 conditionally variable control pulse amplitude and width at the beginning of a power source current alternation period and then discharges until the next current alternation period commences. Note further that the charging time constant of resistor 11 in the collector of emitter follower 25 and integrating capacitor 207 activated by conduction of start mode hold switch 204 prevent the relatively short duration control pulses of line 802 from rising quickly, or the integrated DC voltage on line 802 to their maximum possible amplitude during start mode operation. During run mode, however, said control pulses are not so limited, and rise quickly and to a higher peak amplitude than in the start mode. Note further that whereas minor variations in the slip proportional pulse width of said control pulses are caused by said integration action of capacitor 207 to be of minor significance during start mode protection charging of capacitor 101, during run mode said control pulse width substantially affects its charge discharge duty cycle and, therefore, the time rate of rise to the inhibit threshold of EET IC1 pin 18. More specifically, a continuous succession of control pulses with the amplitude and width produced by a locked rotor condition will, within a few alternations, charge capacitor 101 primarily through resistor 102, diode 103 to an AC power inhibit command level, yet moderately excessive rotor slip will not. Consider now protection processing 4 response during the previously assumed sudden heavy load event. When rotor slip increased in the first moments after said load application, capacitor 101 began charging in accordance with the amplitude and width of said control pulses on line 802. Recall that although excessive rotor slip occurred momentarily, the rotor never actually stopped and, therefore, said pulses never reached locked rotor amplitude width proportions for even one alternation. Thus, during worst case load application events, protection processing 4 will not issue an AC power inhibit command. Assume now a condition wherein motor 11 is running with an empty rotor shaft 12 and is clutch coupled to a jammed load mechanism. In other words, assume a running motor 11 is almost instantly caused to have a locked rotor event. In the first moments after said event, the circuit of the present invention responds as described above, i.e., it begins increasing motor 11 stator voltage to a new load demand. However, in this latter instance, rotor slip continues to increase as stator voltage rapidly increases in response to accelerate command action previously described. Thus, within a few alternations, the control pulses on line 802 assume the magnitude and form which corresponds to a locked rotor condition. Within a few power source alternations after motor 11 rotor ceases rotation, capacitor 101 charges sufficiently to command EET IC1 pin 18 to an AC power gate trigger inhibit mode. Until DC voltage input to EET IC1 pin 20 is removed, then re applied, EET IC1 will remain in said inhibit mode and solid state switches 9 and 10 will not couple stator voltage to motor 11. The foregoing description of the present invention s operation during start and run modes assumed that 3 AC power source 300 supplied motor 11 with nameplate rated input voltage on line 17, 18 and 19 of Figure 1. However, during the long life of an industrial 3 motor, three common AC power source anomalies may cause severe, or catastrophic induction motor damage. They are When said anomalies are short term events, stator winding damage is unlikely. However, in instances where they occur frequently or persist for extended periods, excessive stator current flow wastes energy and often causes permanent motor damage. As described below, the present invention arrangement of 3 DC power supply 16 monitors characteristics of AC power line input voltage and commands EET IC1 to an AC power inhibit state under certain adverse conditions thereby protecting motor 11 from particular AC input power anomalies. As shown in Figure 8, 3 DC power supply 16 develops various system low power e.g., 50 milliwatts bias by transformer coupling means from the AC power source 300 input on lines 17, 18 and 19. More specifically, full wave, unfiltered minus power source voltage alternations are developed by conventional transformer diode rectifier assemblies 715 from lines 17, 18 and 19 and supplied as Said power supply 16 also develops full wave rectified DC voltages from AC power input lines 17, 18 and 19 by capacitor coupling means which cooperates with other circuit elements to simultaneously provide More specificaly, capacitors 700, 701 and 702 couple 3 AC voltage from said input lines to 30 full wave diode bridge 703. The plus DC voltage output of bridge 703 is connected by line 717 The foregoing capacitively coupled arrangement satisfies DC voltage requirements of discrete and integrated circuits of the present invention and performs additional practical functions. For example, the said arrangement simultaneously provides a low impedance AC signal path from lines 17, 18 and 19 through capacitors 700, 701, 702, diode bridge 703 and capacitor 709 to ground. Thus, high frequency RFI noise generated by phase angle delayed AC power switching of solid switches 9 and 10 is conducted to ground, which action substantially reduces RFI radiated from lines 17, 18 and 19, or coupled thereby toward AC power source 300, i.e., along incoming AC power lines. Note further that capacitors 700, 701 and 702 are essentially connected in parallel to ground with AC input power lines 17, 18 and 19 to motor 11 which, by its nature, comprises an inductive load that lowers said input lines power factors. Said parallel capacitor connection arrangement thus also provides a degree of power factor correction that partially offsets the inductive nature of motor 11 and becomes especially significant with fractional horsepower motors. Finally, a terminal R in parallel with A is connected via line 717 to the plus terminal of bridge 703. As previously noted, all plus DC system operating voltages are developed by bridge 703. Therefore, if line 717 bridge 703 positive DC output is switched to ground, as at terminal R via a line 714 to one terminal of SPST switch 713 whose other terminal is grounded , said system DC operating voltages are, in effect, turned off. In said off state, turn on triggers for solid state switches 9 and 10 cannot be generated and, therefore, AC power source 300 voltage on lines 18 and 19 will not be coupled to motor 11 stator windings 13 and 14. Thus, merely grounding line 717 terminal R serves to disconnect, i.e., turn off AC power to motor 11, or vice versa. Additionally, grounding terminal R turns off power consumption by other circuit elements fed by 3 diode bridge 703. However, the power factor correction function of capacitors 700, 701 and 702 continues since they are now grounded through bridge 703 by direct connection via switch 713 instead of an AC ground path through capacitor 709. In other words, the present arrangement use of capacitively coupled, bridge type rectifier assembly 703 cooperates with other invention portions to synergistically perform several useful and or necessary e.g. motor power on off control and RFI suppression functions beyond merely supplying DC operating voltages. DC voltage regulation and AC power source 300 high voltage event compensation means of DC power supply 16 are examined and described below. Referring still to Figure 8, note that line 717 output of bridge 703 is conducted to ground through a 25V zener diode 704 and a resistor 705. The substantially higher than needed AC source voltage is losslessly dropped across the AC impedance of capacitors 700, 701 and 702 by conduction of various circuit components and zener diode 704. By design choice of component values, a low voltage e.g., 2 volts may be developed across resistor 705 by conduction of zener diode 704 when AC power source 300 supplies nominally rated voltage. When said AC voltage varies, said low voltage will proportionally vary. Therefore, said low voltage may be coupled via line 716 through terminal E to wave modifier portions of EET IC1 as AC power line voltage magnitude responsive bias. Thus, when AC power source voltage rises, and the unregulated reverse bias output of transformer assemblies 715 rises, positive bias voltage output of terminal E likewise rises, which action offsets said negative bias increase to EET IC1, and vice versa. Said bias compensation improves energy saving during start and run mode operation by the present invention under conditions of AC input votages substantially higher than the rated voltage of motor 11. AC power source 300 monitoring by, and motor protection action of, a power source processing 6A of 30 DC power supply 16 is now described with reference to Figure 8. Reverse bias outputs of transformer assemblies 715 provide signal inputs to power source processing 6A via lines 750, 751 and 752 to one end of identical resistors 710 whose other ends are common and connected via pull up resistor 711 to the cathode of zener voltage regulating diode 708 and further coupled through isolating diode 712 and terminal P to EET IC1 AC power inhibit pin 18. By choice of component values, said common connection point may be caused to assume a particular negative value when all three phases of AC power source 300 supply 65 or more of rated nominal input voltage to lines 17, 18 and 19. If said AC power source voltage falls below said 65 value, the common junction of resistors 710, 711 and diode 712 will be raised to a positive voltage level by pull up resistor 711. Diode 712, being positively biased under this condition, conducts said junction positive voltage to EET IC1 pin 18, which action comprises an AC power inhibit command to EET IC1. Thus, in the event AC power source 300 voltage falls below 65 of nominal, a condition whereunder motor 11 would be seriously underpowered and subject to starting difficulties or overheating with moderate or higher rated loads, power source processing 6A issues an AC power inhibit command positive voltages to EET IC1. Solid state switches 9 and 10, receiving no further turn on triggers from EET IC1, cease coupling said low input voltage from AC power source 300 to motor 11 stator windings 13 and 14. Consider now a phase loss condition on any one of input power lines 17, 18 or 19. When all phases are present, the common junction of resistors 710 realises continuous negative DC voltage. However, loss of any input phase results in a single phase condition between the remaining two powered lines. Under said single phase AC power input condition, the common junction of resistors 710 realizes a single phase, full wave rectified waveform. That is, negative half sine wave alternations which rise to zero rather than the previous continuous negative DC voltage produced by 3 input power. Thus, as said first single phase negative alternation rises toward zero, pull up resistor 711 causes the common junction or resistors 710, 711 and diode 712 to rise to a positive voltage. As in the case of low AC input voltage described above, said junction positive voltage comprises an AC power inhibit command to EET IC1 pin 18 and AC power ceases to be coupled to motor 11 stator windings 13 and 14 by solid state switches 9 and 10. The present invention s unique energy saving and motor protection operation during start and run modes is summarised below under the following motor 11 conditions The following applies to conditions 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 above. At the first instant when AC power source 300 is energised, Figure 1 shows that At said first instant, and for a few AC power source alternations thereafter, no current flows in motor 11 stator windings since solid state switches 9 and 10 are in an off state, and turn on gate triggers are not yet being generated by EET IC1. At this moment after power turn on, assume condition 1 above and refer to Figure 3. System reverse bias is instantly coupled from DC power supply 16 via terminals 8, 10, F and D to EET IC1 and rising plus DC voltages via terminals A , C and E . The rising voltage at DC power supply 16 terminal A comprises a system start up signal, and, therefore, EET IC1 commands internal circuitry, start mode processing 3, protection processing 4 and DC control voltage processing 5 external circuitry into a particular set of conditions which cooperatively establish what hereinafter is termed start mode operation. Briefly stated, said conditions Item c above enables operator manual selection of start mode maximum torque developed in motor 11 by controlled current limiting of stator current. Assuming said selected start up torque is adequate for motor 11 start up load demand, rotor acceleration commences without the excessive current surge that occurs with full power line voltage starting or the greater than necessary current surges commonly realised with various prior art reduced voltage motor start means. If the operator preferred start up torque selection is inadequate to meet the actual demand, i.e., acceleration to near synchronous speed within the operator selected AC power inhibit delay time period does not transpire, protection processing 4 commands EET IC1 to inhibit turn on of solid state switches 9 and 10 and, therefore, prevents stator current flow in motor 11 until AC power source 300 is switched off, then on again. Operator detemination of an unknown load start up demand is thus easily determined without measurement instruments by merely incrementally advancing start current ADJ control 211 until motor start up occurs within the operator selected acceleration time when AC power source 300 is switched on. When thus adjusted, motor 11 rotation will start slowly as rotor torque gradually increases, then smoothly accelerate to near synchronous speed with near minimum power consumption in a time period determined by rotor load demand and motor 11 s natural characteristics. At said speed, start mode processing 3 will transfer system control by EET IC1 to run mode operation. In said run mode, reduced stator voltage magnitude coupled by solid state switches 9 and 10 to motor 11 stator windings is caused to subsequently be proportional to load demand in response to the load pulse current demodulator portion of EET IC1. Thus, full power line voltage is never applied to motor 11 during controlled current start up, nor even at the end of start mode operation unless actually required by rotor load demand. Assume now an AC input power line 17, 18 or 19, is open circuited condition 2 above before motor 11 start up is attempted, or occurs later during run mode operation. Said condition is referred to as phase loss . Under said condition, power source processing 6A of 3 DC power supply 16 Figure 8 commands EET IC1 within one cycle of AC power source 300 to inhibit turn on of solid state switches 9 and 10. Thus, if motor 11 start up is attempted under said condition, EET IC1 switches to an AC power inhibit state before start mode operation can be established, thereby preventing locked rotor start up current flow in any stator winding. If phase loss occurs when the present invention is in the run mode, stator current flow in the remaining two power windings is terminated within one current alternation of AC power source 300. In other words, the present invention provides input phase loss protection to motor 11 in one cycle, or less, of AC power source 300 under any operating condition. Assume now a locked rotor state exists when motor 11 start up is attempted condition 3 above . In response to stator current sample control pulse characteristics which correspond to higher than full load magnitude, protection processing 4 start mode operation commands EET IC1 to an AC power inhibit state at the conclusion of an operator selected start up time delay period since motor 11 could not accelerate to near synchronous speed. If, however, the controlled current flow selected by the operator is less than full load rating, motor 11 although not running will not be damaged and EET IC1 will not be commanded to an AC power inhibit state. In other words, motor 11 is protected from prolonged high magnitudes of normal reduced voltage start up current or locked rotor condition excessive current magnitudes that occur during start mode operation. Assume now a locked rotor event occurs during otherwise routine running of motor 11 condition 4 above . In response to stator current sample control pulse characteristics which correspond only to a locked rotor conditon when rapidly increasing AC voltage is coupled to motor 11 stator windings, protection processing 4 run mode operation which is not operator adjustable commands EET IC1 to an AC power inhibit state within a few power source alternations after rotor rotation ceases. Assume now that AC power source 300 voltage is substantially lower than motor 11 rated nameplate specified input voltage condition 5 above . Below about 65 of power source nominal voltage rating, power source processing 6A of 3 power supply 16, Figure 8 will command EET IC1 to an AC power inhibit state, preventing motor 11 start up or continued run mode operation. However, if motor 11 is running at near maximum rated load and power source 300 decreases substantially causing motor 11 to stall into a locked rotor condition , protection processing 4 or power source processing 6A will command EET IC1 to an AC power inhibit state before AC power source 300 voltage falls to or below 65 of nominal rating. Assume now that AC power source 300 voltage is substantially higher than motor 11 rated nameplate specified input voltage condition 6 above . Assume further that the breakdown voltage rating of solid state switches 9 and 10 is not a performance limiting factor, i.e., said assemblies will operate normally with the higher than nominal voltage of AC power source 300 assumed for discussion purposes. The present system will provide the above described energy saving, motor protection functions in start and run mode operation with AC power source 300 over voltage magnitude of approximately twenty percent i.e., 120 of nominal . However, as the over voltage condition rises above about twenty percent, the high voltage bias compensation circuitry of 3 DC power supply 16 becomes less effective and the rotor slip induced control signal pulse amplitude coupled by motor load pulse processing 2 to protection processing 4 begins to increase with AC power source 300 voltage increase, i.e., said control pulse characteristic becomes source voltage responsive instead of only manual selection responsive in start mode and load controlled responsive in run mode . More specifically, in both start and run mode operation, said source voltage response by said control pulse amplitude decreases the AC power inhibit delay of protection processing 4. Thus, at some percent increased magnitude of AC power source voltage 300 above 120 of nominal , protection processing 4 will command EET IC1 to an inhibit state during an attempt to start motor 11, i.e., start mode operation will be terminated during motor 11 acceleration time. In other words, solid state switches 9 and 10 are inhibited during start mode if AC power source 300 supplies substantially higher i.e., typically in excess of 125 than nameplate rated voltage, thereby protecting motor 11 from potentially damaging stator current magnitudes during start up Protection processing 4 AC power inhibit action likewise occurs under certain circumstances if AC power source 300 voltage rises above about twenty percent of nominal rating subsequent to motor start up, i.e., when the present invention is in run mode operation. Recall it was previously noted that rotor slip induced control pulse amplitude increases with substantial power source voltage increase. Therefore, as in the instance of start mode operation described above, protection processing 4 AC power inhibit action becomes controllingly responsive to excessive source voltage amplitude as well as load demand, and especially with sudden increases in load demand. More particularly, at some magnitude above 120 of nominal power source voltage, said control pulse amplitude will rise sufficiently to cause protection processing 4 to command EET IC1 to an inhibit state, thereby inhibiting solid state switches 9 and 10 conduction, which action terminates current flow into motor 11 stator windings. Sudden load increases from very light load to heavy or over load demand will cause protection processing 4 inhibit command action at lower over voltage magnitudes than, for example, run mode operation with a steady load. Summarising system performance with higher than rated AC power source 300 voltage, controlled currrent reduced voltage start and subsequent energy saving run mode operation continue until said source voltage increase exceeds about 120 of nominal. At a particular voltage above this magnitude, subject to dynamic conditions of the moment, AC power coupling to motor 11 stator windings by solid state switches 9 and 10 is inhibited by command of protection processing 4. While I have described a particular embodiment of an operational model constructed in accordance with the present invention, many variations in implementation will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, whereas the arrangement described herein relies almost entirely upon analog circuit and signal pulse processing means, the equivalent of nearly all said analog means can be achieved with microprocessor technology implemented by associated hardware and software means that rely upon the concepts of the present invention. By way of specific example, the operator selectable AC power inhibit delay period of protection processing 4 in start mode operation developed by using signal pulses to charge a capacitor to a particular voltage threshold through a manually variable resistor 100 may be accomplished by digitally counting said pulses and manually programming, i.e., selecting the particular pulse count at which an AC power inhibit action occurs. It must be understood, therefore, that the foregoing description is intended to be illustrative only and not limitative of the present invention.
