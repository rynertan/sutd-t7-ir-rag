## Description
This invention relates to the inhibition of corrosion in aqueous systems, especially in cooling water systems and their associated equipment. A variety of different anions have been used to inhibit corrosion. These include phosphates, nitrites, chromates, phosphonates and molybdates. The effectiveness of the various anions is not, of course, the same and although many of them are reasonably effective they all possess one or more drawbacks. In particular, the use of orthophosphate is well established. However, in order for the orthophosphate to be effective in the particular aqueous system, it is quite frequently necessary to use concentrations of orthophosphate greater than 10 ppm. However, the use of these higher concentrations of orthophosphate, in particular, makes it necessary to work in the presence of highly effective anionic dispersants in order to prevent calcium phosphate from fouling the heat exchangers and pipework in the system. The calcium phosphate suspended in the water in this way does not contribute towards corrosion inhibition and can, in fact, cause corrosion because if it is allowed to settle out on ferrous metal parts of the system corrosion can form underneath the resulting deposits and these are, of course, less accessible to the corrosion inhibitor. Sodium nitrite is also well known as a corrosion inhibitor but it is normally necessary to use it in concentrations of 500 1000 ppm. At these levels the use of nitrite is environmentally unacceptable. Accordingly, therefore, it is not generally possible to use sodium nitrite in spite of its effectiveness. It has now been found, according to the present invention, that the amounts of a corrosion controlling or inhibiting salt which is capable of forming a passivating or protective anodic film, namely an orthophosphate or nitrite, can be reduced significantly if they are used in combination with a cationic polymer. This passivating film is typically of gamma ferric oxide. It has been found that a useful synergistic effect can be obtained with the result that a composition which is effective in rapidly forming a passivating film and subsequently inhibiting corrosion can be provided which contains much smaller amounts of the corrosion inhibiting salt. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for inhibiting corrosion in an aqueous system which comprises adding to the system a corrosion inhibiting salt capable of forming a passivating film at the anode or anodic film which is an orthophosphate or nitrite and a protonated or quaternary ammonium cationic polymer which has a molecular weight from 400 to 10,000. The salts are typically water soluble salts, especially alkali metal, in particular sodium or potassium, salts. Ammonium salts are generally not to be recommended as they may promote attack on yellow metals such as copper or brass. The present invention has particular utility when used with orthophosphates such as disodium and trisodium orthophosphate. In general, by using the specified cationic polymers it is possible to use less than 10 ppm of orthophosphate and, indeed, amounts of say 5 ppm, orthophosphate together with a similar quantity of polymer is much more effective than the use of 10 ppm of orthophosphate by itself. Even though orthophosphates by themselves may not form a passivating anodic film at these low concentrations it is believed that such a film is formed when the polymer is present. In addition problems of pitting corrosion can be overcome. In contrast polyphosphates act by forming a film at the cathode and therefore are not suitable for use in the present invention. The present invention is also applicable, as indicated, with water soluble inorganic nitrites, especially sodium nitrite normally it is necessary to use 500 to 1000 ppm of sodium nitrite to be effective but such amounts are environmentally unacceptable By using the polymer in combination with the nitrite it is possible to reduce the concentration of the latter to, say, 45 ppm which is an environmentally acceptable level. A considerable variety of different polymers having the required molecular weight can be used provided that they are cationic and either protonated or are quaternary ammonium polymers preferably they are substantially linear i.e. polymers which have substantially no crosslinking but which may contain, for example, cyclic groups in a substantially linear chain. The quaternary ammonium polymers are preferably derived from ethylenically unsaturated monomers containing a quaternary ammonium group or are obtained by reaction between a polyalkylene polyamine and epichlorohydrin, or by reaction between epichlorhydrin, dimethylamine and either ethylene diamine or polyalkylene polyamine. Typical cationic polymers which can be used in the present invention and which are derived from an ethylenically unsaturated monomer include homo and co polymers of vinyl compounds such as a vinyl pyridine and vinyl imidazole which may be quaternised with, say, a C₁ to C₁₈ alkyl halide, a benzyl halide, especially a chloride, or dimethyl or diethyl sulphate, or b vinyl benzyl chloride which may be quaternised with, say, a tertiary amine of formula NR₁R₂R₃ in which R₁ R₂ and R₃ are independently lower alkyl, typically of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such that one of R₁ R₂ and R₃ can be C₁ to C₁₈ alkyl allyl compounds such as diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride or acrylic derivatives such as i a dialkyl aminomethyl meth acrylamide which may be quaternised with, say, a C₁ to C₁₈ alkyl halide, a benzyl halide or dimethyl or diethyl sulphate, ii a methacrylamido propyl tri C₁ to C₄ alkyl, especially methyl ammonium salt, or iii a meth acryloyloxyethyl tri C₁ to C₄ alkyl, especially methyl ammonium salt, said salt ii or iii being a halide, especially a chloride, methosulphate, ethosulphate or 1 and 0 90 mol of recurring units of the formula in which R₁ represents hydrogen or a lower alkyl radical, typically of 1 4 carbon atoms, R₂ represents a long chain alkyl group, typically of 8 to 18 carbon atoms, R₃, R₄ and R₅ independently represent hydrogen or a lower alkyl group while X represents an anion,typically a halide ion, a methosulfate ion, an ethosulfate ion or Other quaternary ammonium polymers derived from an unsaturated monomer include the homo polymer of diallyldimethylammonium chloride which possesses recurring units of the formula In this respect, it should be noted that this polymer should be regarded as substantially linear since although it contains cyclic groupings these groupings are connected along a linear chain and there is no crosslinking. Other polymers which can be used and which are derived from unsaturated monomers include those having the formula where Z and Z which may be the same or different is CH₂CH CHCH₂ or CH₂ CHOHCH₂ , Y and Y , which may be the same or different, are either X or NH R , X is a halogen of atomic weight greater than 30, n is an integer of from 2 to 20, and R and R I may be the same or different alkyl groups of from 1 to 18 carbon atoms optionally substituted by 1 to 2 hydroxyl groups or II when taken together with N represent a saturated or unsaturated ring of from 5 to 7 atoms or III when taken together with N and an oxygen atom represent the N morpholino group, which are described in U.S. Patent US A 4397743. A particularly preferred such polymer is poly dimethylbutenyl ammonium chloride bis triethanol ammonium chloride . Another class of polymer which can be used and which is derived from ethylenically unsaturated monomers includes polybutadienes which have been reacted with a lower alkyl amine and some of the resulting dialkyl amino groups are quaternised. In general, therefore, the polymer will possess recurring units of the formula in the molar proportions a b₁ b₂ c, respectively, where R represents a lower alkyl radical, typically a methyl or ethyl radical. It should be understood that the lower alkyl radicals need not all be the same. Typical quaternising agents include methyl chloride, dimethyl sulfate and diethyl sulfate. Varying ratios of a b₁ b₂ c may be used with the amine amounts b₁ b₂ being generally from 10 90 with a c being from 90 10 . These polymers can be obtained by reacting polybutadiene with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of an appropriate lower alkyl amine. Of the quaternary ammonium polymers which are derived from epichlorohydrin and various amines, particular reference should be made to the polymers described in British Specification GB A 2085433 and GB A 1486396. A typical amine which can be employed is N,N,N ,N tetramethylethylenediamine as well as ethylenediamine used together with dimethylamine and triethanolamine. Particularly preferred polymers of this type for use in the present invention are those having the formula where N is from O 500. although, of course, other amines can be employed. Other polymers which can be used include protonated polymers such as polymers corresponding to the above quaternary ammonium polymers where the amine groups are not quaternised but are neutralised with acid, such as hydrochloric acid as well as cationic tannin derivatives, such as those obtained by a Mannich type reaction of tannin a condensed polyphenolic body with formaldehyde and an amine, formed as a salt e.g. acetate, formate, hydrochloride. These cationic tannin derivatives can also be quaternised. Further polymers which can be used include the polyamine polymers which have been crosslinked such as polyamideamine polyethylene polyamine copolymers crosslinked with, say, epichlorohydrin. The amounts of the components used do, of course, depend, to some extent, on the severity of the corrosion conditions but, of course, corrosion inhibiting amounts are desirable. In general, however, from 1 50 ppm, especially from 3 10 ppm, of each will be used and the relative amounts of the two components will generally vary from 1 10 to 10 1 by weight, especially with the polymer concentration being at least as great as that of the salt. Although the components can be added to the system separately it will generally be more convenient to add them together as a single composition. Accordingly, the present invention also provides a composition suitable for addition to an aqueous system which comprises a protonated or quaternary ammonium cationic polymer which has a molecular weight of 400 to 10,000 and a water soluble corrosion inhibiting salt which is capable of forming a passivating anodic film which is an orthophosphate or nitrite. The compositions of the present invention will normally be in the form of an aqueous solution containing, in general, from 1 25 by weight active ingredient solids . A common concentration is from 5 10 by weight. The additives used in the present invention can be used, sometimes advantageously, together with other water treatment additives such as phosphonates which do not act anodically such as pentaphosphonomethylene substituted diethylenetriamine, dispersants such as sulphonated and carboxylated polymers, especially copolymers of maleic acid and sulphonated styrene or of methacrylic acid and 2 acrylamido 2 methyl propane sulphonic acid azoles such as benzotriazole and biocides such as isothiazolones, methylene bis thiocyanate , quaternary ammonium compounds and chlorine release agents. In fact certain of the cationic polymers possess biocidal properties thereby enhancing the effect of the biocides. The following Examples further illustrate the present invention. These examples were carried out on a laboratory recirculating rig using a synthetic water possessing 80 ppm calcium hardness, 25 ppm magnesium hardness and 100 ppm M alkalinity and pH of 8.6. The temperature of the water was maintained at 130 F 54,4 C and the rig was first passivated for one day at three times the normal dose level to form a passivating film. The test lasted three days using a flow rate of 2 ft. 0.61 m per second in line and 0.2 ft 0,06 cm per second in the tank. Mild steel test coupons were placed in the line and in the tank, corrosion rates being calculated from the weight loss of the coupons during the experiment. In this test, the additives were orthophosphate in the form of disodium hydrogen phosphate and a cationic polymer denoted as polymer A which was a quaternary ammonium compound formed from epichlorohydrin, ethylenediamine, dimethylamine and triethanolamine obtained according to the procedure described in British specification GB A 2085433, having molecular weight of 5,000 6,000. The results obtained are shown in the following table These Examples demonstrate the synergistic effect obtained using polymer A in conjunction with the orthophosphate in the prevention of corrosion of mild steel. The test procedure used in Examples 1 6 was repeated using different polymers. Polymer B was a copolymer of lauryl methacrylate and methacryloyloxyethyl trimethylammonium metho sulfate mol ratio 40 60 having a molecular weight of 5,000 while polymer C was a homopolymer of diallyldimethylammonium chloride having a molecular weight of 4,000 5,000. The results obtained are shown in the following table. It is clear from these results that the cationic polymers are not in themselves corrosion inhibitors but act synergistically with the orthophosphate. The test procedure used in Examples 1 6 was repeated but varying the ratios of the cationic polymers to orthophosphate. By way of comparison sodium hexametaphosphate was used. The results obtained are shown in the following table These examples demonstrate that the combination of the present invention can be employed in an aqueous system in the presence of other additives where interaction with the additive might have been expected. The test procedure used in the preceding Examples was followed. The results obtained are shown in the following table The same test procedure was employed using the ingredients specified in the following table which gives the results obtained It is clear from Examples C and 22 that the present invention is more effective than a combination of the same polymer and a polyphosphate. Examples 22 and 23 illustrate the fact that the presence of the cationic polymer inhibits pitting corrosion when small concentrations of orthophosphate are employed. These Examples illustrate the effectiveness of 2 further cationic polymers in the presence of orthophosphate. The same test procedure was used. These Examples illustrate the effectiveness of the cationic polymers when used with sodium nitrite at a much lower concentration than that usually employed while obtaining acceptable corrosion rates. These Examples demonstrate the effectiveness of further types of cationic polymer in combination with a salt capable of forming an anodic passivating film. The following Examples illustrate the ability of the cationic polymer to enable one to use very small amounts of corrosion inhibiting salt. The results obtained are shown in the following table
