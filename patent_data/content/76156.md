## Abstract
An air breather structure for oil seals in an automatic transmission having a final reduction device and an automa tic transmission device. Each oil seal comprises a pair of sealing members with a space therebetween. A differential case 26 for the final reduction device 17 and an automatic transmission case 28 are coupled end to end with the interposition of a gasket 27 . Two rotating shafts 11, 16 extend across the gasket for transmitting the output of the automatic transmission to the wheels of four wheel drive vehicle. Oil seals 31, 33 are provided around each of the rotating shafts, both being located in the automatic transmis sion case 28 and each comprising two sealing members 34, 35 with a space 36 therebetween. The space 36 of each oil seal 31, 33 is vented to atmosphere through passages including cavities 41, 44, 46 in both cases, openings 42, 45 formed in the gasket 27 and a vent hole 40 formed in an upper portion of the differential case 26 .
