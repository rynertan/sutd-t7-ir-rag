# Selective call signal detection circuit for multi channel access type radio receiving station.

## Abstract
A selective call signal detection circuit comprises a channel free busy state oetection circuit 9 for scanning a plurality of communication channels to determine their respective free busy states, a present time channel free busy state memory circuit 11 for temporarily storing channel free busy detection signals resulting from the aforemen tioned scanning of communication channels, a past time channel free busy state memory circuit 12 for receiving into storage therein in the subsequent channel scanning cycle the channel free busy detection signals of the previous scanning cycle formerly stored in the aforementioned present time channel free busy state memory circuit 11 , and a compari son circuit 13 for comparing the signals from the aforemen tioned present time past time channel free busy state mem ory circuits 11, 12 thereby discriminating between a selective call signal addressed to a given receiving station and selective call signals addressed to other receiving stations. Since this selective call signal detection circuit permits quick discrimination between a channel in the state of normal communication and a channel in the state of selective call, it serves to enhance the efficiency of channel scanning.
