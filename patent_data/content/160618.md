## Description
The present invention relates to hydantoin derivatives, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and pharmaceutical compositions containing them as an active ingredient. Although the oral sulfonylureas and biguanides having hypoglycemic activity have previously been used for the treatment of diabetes, they have often given rise to side effects such as excessive hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis. On the other hand, insulin, a well known antidiabetic, can only be administered intravenously. It has now been found that certain hydantoin derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof possess excellent hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic and diuretic effects as well as low toxicity and increased safety. An object of the present invention is to provide orally administrable hydantoin derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof having hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic and diuretic activity as well as low toxicity, diminished side effects and good safety properties. These derivatives and salts are useful for preparing pharmaceutical compositions.

The following description serves to illustrate the pharmaceutical properties of compounds of the present invention. The test compounds of the present invention were administered to groups of 10 ddY strain male mice, and the LD₅₀ values were calculated based on the death rate for 7 days thereafter according to the Litchfield Wilcoxon s method. As a result, in every case of oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal and subcutaneous administrations, none of the mice, which were given more than 5,000 mg kg of the test compounds, died. The mice also have no momentary symptom directly after the administration. Therefore the LD₅₀ values of the compounds of the present invention were more than 5,000 mg kg. Furthermore, no abnormalities were found by autopsy after the medication in any organs. Groups of 10 Sprague Dawley strain male rats weighing about 250 g which were fasted for 18 hours were used for measurement of hypoglycemic effect according to the modified method by Dulin et al. Dulin, W. L. et al., Proc. Soc. Expl. Med., An example of the results is shown in Table 1. The test drugs were orally administered to groups of 6 Wisterstrain male rats weighing 210 250 which were fasted for 20 hours. 2 hours later, the serum was obtained in the same manner described in 2 . Serum triglyceride was measured according to the GPO p chlorophenol colorimetric determination and serum free fatty acid was measured according to the Acyl CoA Synthetase Acyl CoA Oxidase method. An example of the results is shown in Table 2. 20 mg kg of the compound 1 of the present invention was orally administered to rats, and the total amount of excreted sodium within 1 day was then measured according to the method by Lipschitz Further, in the case of subcutaneous administration to mice, up to 2 hours after the administration, the group which was given the compound 1 had 50.5 increase in the amount of urine compared with the control group. In addition, 200 mg kg of the compound 1 of the present invention was orally administered to glucose loaded rats and the urine sugar was measured. No difference was found between the medicated and control groups. As clearly shown by the above mentioned results, the compounds of the present invention have excellent hypoglycemic effect. Having an excellent feature of maintaining the subjects always at nearly the normal level without excessively lowering the blood sugar level even on high doses, the compounds of the present invention are extremely useful drugs for the treatment of severe hyperglycemia. As mentioned above, the compounds of the present invention have low toxicity and increased safety, so that longterm continuous administration and oral use are possible. Therefore, the compounds are not only useful as antidiabetics but also as drugs for various diseases associated with diabetes, e.g. diabetic angiopathy, diabetic arteriosclerosis, diabetic retinitis, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic neurosis and diabetic microangiopathy. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention also have a diuretic effect, consequently they are very useful as drugs for the above mentioned diseases. In addition, as shown in Table 2, the compounds of the present invention have a hypolipidemic effect. Therefore, they are useful as drugs for the treatment of hyperlipidemia and for the treatment or the prevention of various diseases caused by hyperlipidemia, such as arteriosclerosis, obesity and cardiopathy.
