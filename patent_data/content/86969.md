# Selective removal of catechol from 2 methallyloxyphenol.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for selectively removing catechol from a mixture comprising catechol, 2 methallyloxyphenol, various salts, and by products by treating the mixture with aqueous base, the aqueous phase being preferably saturated with respect to salts present the catechol may then be recovered for recycle by acidifying the resulting aqueous phase and extracting the acidified aqueous phase with a suitable organic solvent.
