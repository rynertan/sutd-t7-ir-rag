# Circuit arrangement for controlling a multi beam acousto optical cell.

## Abstract
A acousto optical cell 1 has at least one ultra sonic transducer 3 from which the outgoing laser beams 8, 11 are coming out in a common plane, the circuit arrangement comprises VHF or UHF osclllators 5, 10 coupled through respective control stages 6 to the ultra sonic transducers 3 . The frequency of each oscillator defines the diffraction angle of an associated outgoing laser beam the intensity of which is dependent from the amplitude of the oscillator. The passage of the osciilator outputs towards the respective ultrasonic transducers 3 is controlled by the control stages 6 according to prede termined operational requirements. In order to enable the generation of outgoing laser beams 8, 11 with variable diflraction angles within the common plane of the outgoing beams at least one of the high frequency oscillators Is designed as an oscillator of variable frequency 10, 18 having a frequency determining input 13 . By means of applying a control voltage to this frequency determining input 13 the diffraction angle of the corresponding outgoing laser beam can be adjusted during operation which has advantages in certain fields of application.
