# Electro optical device.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an electro optical device for recording and or reading recording tracks in a recording surface of an optically readable disk having a plane surface 11 by means of a radiation beam, comprising a frame 43 , a turntable supporting means 45 for a turntable 55 which is rotatable about an axis of rotation 57 , an objective support ing means for an objective 15 having an optical axis 39 , a focussing actuator 24 for moving the objective along the optical axis, guide means for moving the objective and or the turntable relative to each other between a first position, in which they are situated nearer each other, and a second position, in which they are situated more remote from each other, and correction means for reducing, in the case of an oblique position of said surface of the disk, the angle between said optical axis and the normal to said surface at the location where the optical axis intersects the disk surface. The correction means comprise a tilting device 101 for tilting the turntable supporting means and or objective supporting means during recording and or reading of the recording tracks about a pivotal axis 99 which extends at least subtantially transversely of the plane defined by the optical axis and the axis of rotation and which, at least in the second position of the objective and the turntable, is situated between the axis of rotation and the optical axis.
