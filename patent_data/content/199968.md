Then the compound of the formula IV is obtained by aromarization of the compound of the formula V. This may be effected in various processes a preferred process is as follows. The compound of the formula V is reacted with sulfur at elevated temperature to obtain the 1,4 thiazine derivative of the formula IV. This reaction proceeds well by stirring the compound of the formula V with from half to 5 fold amount of sulfur and heating the mixture at 120 to 200 C for 0.5 to 8 hours. Generally, no solvent is needed in this reaction however, N,N dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, xylene, o , m , p dichlorobenzen, diglime, etc. may be employed. Alternatively, the compound of the formula IV may be prepared according to a process that the compound of the formula V is reacted with zinc at room temperature or elevated temperature. Some of the compound of the formula V is reacted with zinc to obtain thiazole derivative having dihydro form residue of N containing heterocyclic group at position 6. In this case, it is necessary to oxidize a reaction intermediate by an oxidizing agent. This process is represented by the following formula This reaction proceeds well by stirring the compound of the formula V with excessive amount of zinc and stirring the mixture at room temperature or elevated temperature up to 80 C for 1 to 4 hours. A solvent used in this reaction may be an organic solvent in the form of mixture with water the organic solvent may be carboxylic acid such as formic acid, nitrile such as acetonitrile, ether such as tetrahydrofran, sulfoxide such as dimethylsulfoxide or amide such as methylform amide or the like.

The known starting material 1,4 thiazine derivative of the formula VI may be prepared according to the processes proposed by H. Sokol et al. in J. Am. Chem. Soc., Then, the thiazine derivative having substituent group such as lower alkoxy, halogeno, acyloxy or hydroxy or the like at position 2 may be prepared according to the process by M. Hojo et al. in Synthesis 312, 424 1982 . Thus, the compound of the formula IV is reacted with the compound of the formula A COOOH in which A represents lower alkyl, alicyclic residue or aryl , i.e. peroxycarboxylic acid to obtain the compound of the formula III. This reaction is completed by merely stirring the compound of the formula IV and more than equal mole concentration of the compound of the formula A COOOH under ice cooling for a few minutes. The solvent, which is used in this reaction, may be halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethan, nitrile such as acetonitrile, ether such as tetrahydrofran, sulfoxide such as dimethylsulfoxide or amide such as dimethylformamide or the like.

In view of the state of the reaction system the reactivity and degree of dissociation and the easy availability, m chloroperbenzoic acid is especially preferred. Then, the compound of the formula III is reacted with the nucleophilic reagent of the formula R₄ OH in which R₄ is as defined above to obtain the compound of the formula II . This reaction is completed by merely stirring the compound of the formula III and more than equal mole concentration of the compound of the formula R₄ H at room temperature for more than 1 day.

And, halogenated hydrocarbon such as chloroform or carboxylic acid ester such as ethyl acetate or the like may be used as an eluent. The thiazine derivative having substituent at position 2, i.e. the compound of the formula II, may be also obtained by the following process. One mole concentration of the compound of the formula IV is reacted with more than two mole concentration of the compound of the formula A COOOH and more than two mole concentration of the compound of R₄ OH in a similar manner as above. Alternatively, the compound of the formula II may be obtained by introduction of OR₄ group position at 2 in the same manner as above, then introduction of R₃ group position at 6 in the same manner as above. The compound of the formula II is reacted with an acid to obtain the compound of the formula I i.e. thiazole derivative having lower alkoxycarbonyl group at position 2. This reaction is completed by merely allowing the compound of the formula II with more than equal mole concentration of the acid and the mixture to stand at room temperature for more than 10 minutes. The acid used in this reaction may be inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, etc. or organic acid such as acetic acid, etc. In view of the state of the reaction system the reactivity and degree of dissciation and the easy availability, hydrochloric acid is especially preferred. This reaction is proceeded by adding the compound of the formula II into the acid which is diluted with water. The solvent used in this reaction is water. Purification of the compound of the formula I may be accomplished by recrystallization from aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene or alicyclic hydrocarbon such as cyclopentane, cyclohexane or the like or a mixture of two or more of these solvents. Alternatively, such purification may be accomplished by column chromatography or thin layer chromatography.

Alternatively, it may be accomplished by silica gel column chromatography or silica gel thin layer chromatography. The compound of the formula I , i.e. the thiazole derivative having cyano group at position 2, is obtained by treating the compound of the formula I , especially 2 carbamoylthiazole derivative in which R₅ and R₆ are hydrogen atoms, with a dehydrating agent in the usual way. More specifically, the reaction is completed by stirring the compound of the formula I and more than equal mole of a dehydrating agent such as p toluenesulfonyl chloride or phosphorus trichloride at 60 to 120 C for about 20 hours. It is preferable to conduct this reaction in the presence of a base such as pyridine. Amide such as N,N dimethylformamide, ether such as tetra hydrofran or heterocyclic compound having nitrogen atom such as pyridine is employed as a solvent. Purification of the compound of the formula I may be accomplished by recrystallization from halogenated hydrocarbon such as chloroform or lower alcohol such as methanol, ethanol or iso propanol.
