# Antiskid control with wheel speed difference compensation.

## Abstract
In an antiskid control system, first and second wheel speed values are derived from pulse signals supplied from wheel speed sensors to indicate respectively the rotational speeds of first and second wheels of the vehicle. A trimming value is derived from the difference between the first and second wheel speed values and used as a multiplier by which the first wheel speed value is multiplied to compensate for the deviation of the speed of the first wheel with respect to the speed of the second wheel. The compensated first wheel speed value compared with a variable threshold that is a func tion of the speed of the vehicle to determine the down pressure timing.
