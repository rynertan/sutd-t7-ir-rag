# METHOD FOR POLISHING DETECTOR MATERIAL

## Abstract
A method for chemically mechanically polishing detec tor material 24 such as mercury cadmium telluride HgCdTe to obtain damage free surfaces uses a solution of potassium iodine iodide in a deionized water base, in com bination with an inert lubricant, such as ethylene glycol, and a semisoft porous polishing pad 12 made from, for exam ple, an expanded polyurethane material.
