# Method for erasing a mistyped character.

## Abstract
A correction member moving system for a printer in which an error such as a mistyped character on a recorded member is erased by an error correction member comprises the steps of positioning a correction member at a first position, typing a type corresponding to the error through the error correction member on the recorded member to thereby erase the error, separating the error correction member from the recorded member, and automatically forwarding the error correction member by a predetermined distance. The preferred embodiment, further, comprises the steps of automatically backing the error correction member at the erased position, and positioning the error correction member at a second position.
