## Description
DESCRIPTION PROCESS FOR PURIFYING TERTIARY AMINETechnical Field The present invention relates to a process for purifying an organic extractant comprising a mixture of a tertiary amine and an organic diluent containing an acid as an impurity by washing the same with an alkali to remove the acid therefrom.Background Art A process for recovering an acid such as acetic acid, acrylic acid or nitric acid from an aqueous acid solution using an extractant comprising a tertiary amine and an organic diluent has been known. An aqueous acetic acid solution formed in industrial processes contains various impurities and when acetic acid migrates into a solvent phase in an extraction step, part of the impurities also migrates therein. After the extraction, the extract is washed with an alkali or distilled to separate the solvent from the acid and then the solvent is recycled. After the continuous use of the extractant by the recycling, the impurities in the aqueous acid solution and decomposition products from the extractant are accumulated gradually to cause a reduction in the extracting capacity. Therefore, these impurities must be removed from the recycle extractant. An aqueous acetic acid solution discharged in a cellulose acetate production step contains sulfates derived from sulfuric acid used as a catalyst and impurities derived from pulp. Therefore, in a process for recovering acetic acid using an extractant containing the tertiary amine, the sulfates, the impurities due to pulp, derivatives of the tertiary amine and high boiling products are accumulated in the recycle extractant over a long period of time to reduce the extracting capacity of the solvent. Accordingly, to maintain the impurity concentration of the recycle extractant below a given level, it has been considered to be a conventional process that part of the recycle solvent is taken out and subjected to a decontamination treatment.Various purification processes may be mentioned.However, in processes including a step of heating the solvent such as an evaporation or distillation step, high boiling substances are formed in the purification step due to the decomposition of the tertiary amine, formation of amides and condensation of the diluent to make the distillation operation difficult and also the invite loss of the solvent.Disclosure of Invention After investigations made for the purpose of solving these problems, the inventors have found that the impurity formation in the heating step is caused by the presence of acids in the recycle solvent. The inventors have found also that the impurity formation can be reduced remarkably by washing the solvent with an aqueous alkali before the heating. However, it has been found that in the neutralization and washing with the aqueous alkali solution, the mixture is emulsified by an alkali salt of a high boiling acid or a quaternary salt of the amine in the washing step and, consequently, the oil water separation after the washing becomes quite difficult. The inventors tried to accelerate the separation by breaking the emulsion by various known processes such as a process wherein the separation of the two liquids are accelerated physically by centrifugation, a process wherein the emulsion phase is heated to accelerate the breakabe of emulsion drops and a process wherein the aggregation of emulsion drops is accelerated under a high voltage.However, the effects of these processes were yet unsatisfactory and economically satisfactory results could not be obtained. Thus, it is quite difficult and economically disadvantageous to separate the formed emulsion into the respective phases. After intensive investigations of a process for washing the solvent with an alkali without forming the emulsion, the inventors have found a new purification process for a tertiary amine containing organic extractant by removing an acid from the extractant. The present invention has been attained on the basis of this finding. The present invention relates to a process for purifying a tertiary amine containing organic extractant comprising a mixture of a tertiary amine and an organic diluent containing an acid as an impurity by washing the same with an alkali to remove the impurity, characterized in that the pH of the wash mixture is controlled to 3 to 6 in the washing step, A process for recovering acetic acid from an acetic acid solution with an extractant comprising a tertiary amine and an organic diluent has been disclosed in, for example, the specification of theJapanese Patent Laid Open No. 10131 1981. The present invention will now be described in more detail by the best mode for carrying out the invention acetic acid is extracted from the aqueous solution using, as an organic extractant, a mixture of a tertiary amine such as tri n octylamine TOA and an oxygen containing organic solvent such as 3,3,5 trimethylcyclohexanone TMCH both have boiling points higher than that of acetic acid in an extractor devised to increase the dispersion coalescence frequency of droplets, for example, a mixer settler extractor. The obtained liquid extract is first freed of water which has been contained in the extract in a small amount in a dehydration distillation column, and then introduced into an acetic acid recovery column, where acetic acid free of water is obtained from the top of the column and the regenerated extractant from the bottom.The separation of acetic acid from the extractant is smoothly effected by maintaining a temperature at the bottom of the column at around, for example, 140 to 1500C. Steam is utilized as the source of this heating as usual in chemical factories. Part of the regenerated extractant obtained from the bottom is introduced into the top of the dehydration distillation column to be used as a reflux liquid therein. Although acetic acid is usually likely to go up in the column with water and the oxygen containing compounds, it is extracted by the reflux liquid containing a tertiary amine and goes down, preventing the effusion of acetic acid out of the dehydration distillation column.The remainder of the regenerated extractant e.g.TOA and TMCH obtained from the bottom of the acetic acid recovery column is recycled to the extractor of the first step. The tertiary amines to be used are preferably those having a boiling point higher than that of acetic acid and form a non aqueous phase. The number of carbon atoms contained in the tertiary amine should be around 12 to 40, considering the low solubility in the water phase and the separability from acetic acid by distillation. It is also preferable in order to obtain a large apparent partition coefficient that the tertiary amine has no large branches near the nitrogen atom. It is undesirable to have an ethyl or larger substituent group on a carbon atom neighboring the nitrogen atom by interposing one CH2, not to mention adjacent to the nitrogen atom. It is also to be avoided to have a benzyl group or those having a cyclic structure near the nitrogen atom.In other words, the tertiary amines should be selected, from those which have a partial structure represented by N CH2 CRÚRê, wherein RÚ is a hydrogen atom andR2 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, for example, C6 or higher trialkylamines such as trihexylamine, trioctylamine, triisooctylamine tris2,4,4 trimethylpentylamine , trilaurylamine, dimethyllaurylamine, dimethylhexadecylamine, methyldi tridecyl amine, or dimethyldecylamine tertiary amines having an alkenyl group such as dimethyloleylamine or butylbis 5,5,7, 7 tetramethyl oct 2 en l yl amine XE 204 or tertiary amine mixtures such as dimethylcocoamine, dimethyl C8 12 alkyl amines, or dimethyl hydrogenated tallow amine. Commercially available tertiary amines can be used as such. It is also possible to obtain tertiary amines by alkylating primary or secondary amines available as intermediates by a known method.Among many usable tertiary amines mentioned above,TOA is readily available and shows an excellent apparent partition coefficient when it is admixed with an oxygen containing organic solvent to form an extractant. Examples of the organic solvent to be used in combination with the amines are those oxygen containing organic solvents which have a boiling point higher than acetic acid, e.g. ketones, alcohols, carboxylic esters, or phosphoric esters.When these solvents are used in combination with the tertiary amines described above, acetic acid in the aqueous solution can be extracted with a particularly large apparent partition coefficient. The extractant containing the tertiary amine which is recycled in the recovery of acetic acid as described above contains an inorganic or organic acid as an impurity accumulated therein. The present invention provides a process for purifying the solvent by removing the impurity by washing with an alkali. After investigations made for the purpose of preventing formation of the emulsion in the alkali washing step and loss of the tertiary amine and the organic diluent due to migration to the aqueous phase1 the inventors have found that when the pH is controlled to 3 to 6 in the alkali washing1 the inorganic and organic acids in the solvent are converted into their salts and the salts migrate selectively into the aqueous phase to permit the alkali washing without posing a problem of poor separability of the oil from the water and the loss of the tertiary amine due to migration thereof to the aqueous phase can be prevented completely.Accordingly, a time required for the separation of oil water is reduced, a size of a settler in a mixersettler extractor may be reduced and the loss of the tertiary amine and the organic diluent due to the emulsion formation in the aqueous phase can be eliminated. Therefore, the treatment by an activated sludge becomes unnecessary and problems such as environmental pollution can be exterminated.Examples of the Invention The following examples and comparative examples will further illustrate the present invention, which by no means limit the invention.Example 1 A solvent mixture of tri n octylamine TOA and 3,5,5 trimethylcyclohexanone TMCH volume ratio 50 50 containing 1.5 wt. of sulfuric acid used for the recovery of acetic acid by extraction at 400C in a one stage mixer settler washing device was fed into a mixer at a rate of 400 g h. A 5 wt. aqueous sodium hydroxide solution was fed into the mixer from an aqueous alkalisolution pump connected with a pH controller while the pH of the mixture in the mixer was controlled to 5 to 5.5. The separability in the settler was high.After the alkali washing, 406 g h of the solvent mixture containing 0.53 wt. of water was recovered. Sulfuric acid was not detected in the recovered, high boiling extractant. In the water phase discharged from the settler, 2000 ppn of the organic diluent TMCH was contained in the form of a solution but no tertiary amine TOA was detected.Comparative Example 1 The same solvent mixture was fed into the mixer at a rate of 400 g h using the same device as in Example 1. The alkali washing was effected while the pH was controlled to 7 to 8. 382 g h of the solvent mixture containing 0.68 wt. of water was recovered The dispersibility in the settler was very poor. The water phase discharged was milky and contained 1.8 wt. each of the tertiary amine and the organic diluent in the form of an emulsion.
