# Vitrification of asbestos waste.

## Abstract
Waste asbestos is converted into a glass by maintain ing within an electrical glass melting furnace a body of molten glass at a temperature above the decomposition temperature of asbestos supplying asbestos to the furnace and withdrawing molten glass from the furnace at a tem perature of at least 1000 C. The asbestos is advantageously mixed with cullet and a melt accelerator and fed into the furnace by means of a screw mixer conveyor. The furnace is advantageously operated at a pressure less than atmo spheric pressure.
