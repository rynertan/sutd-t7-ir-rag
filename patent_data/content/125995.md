## Description
This invention relates to magnetically responsive particles and to their use in systems in which the separation of certain molecules from the surrounding medium is necessary or desirable. More particularly, the invention relates to methods for the preparation of magnetically responsive particles comprising a magnetic metal oxide core, which core is comprised of clusters of magnetic metal oxide crystals, generally surrounded by a stable silane coating to which a wide variety of organic and or biological molecules may be coupled. The particles coupled or uncoupled can be dispersed in aqueous media without rapid gravitational settling and conveniently reclaimed from the media with a magnetic field. Preferably, the process provided herein yields particles that are superparamagnetic that is, they do not become permanently magnetized after application of a magnetic field. This property permits the particles to be redispersed without magnetic aggregate formation. Hence the particles may be reused or recycled. Stability of the silane coating and the covalent attachment of molecules thereto also contribute to the particles use and reuse. The magnetically responsive particles of this invention may be coupled to biological or organic molecules with affinity for or the ability to adsorb or which interact with certain other biological or organic molecules. Particles so coupled may be used in a variety of The use of magnetic separations in biological systems as an alternative to gravitational or centrifugal separations has been reviewed B.L. Hirschbein Although the general concept of magnetizing molecules by coupling them to magnetic particles has been discussed and the potential advantages of using such particles for biological purposes recognized, the practical development of magnetic separations has been hindered by several critical properties of magnetic particles developed thus far. Large magnetic particles mean diameter in solution greater than 10 micrometers mm can respond to weak magnetic fields and magnetic field gradients however, they tend to settle rapidly, limiting their usefulness for reactions requiring homogeneous conditions. Large particles also have a more limited surface area per weight than smaller particles, so that less material can be coupled to them. Examples of large particles are those of Robinson The Hersh and Yaverbaum ferromagnetic carrier particles of U.S. Pat. No. 3,933,997 are silanized with silanes capable of reacting with anti digoxin antibodies to chemically couple the antibodies to the carrier particles. Various silane couplings are discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,652,761, That the diameters of the composite particles are probably greater than 10 µm may be explained, at least in part, by the method of silanization employed in the Hersch and Yaverbaum patent. Procedures for silanization known in the art generally differ from each other in the media chosen for the polymerization of silane and its deposition on reactive surfaces. Organic solvents such as toluene H.W. Weetall, in Methods in Enzymology, K. Mosbach ed. , Small magnetic particles with a mean diameter in solution less than about 0.03 µm can be kept in solution by thermal agitation and therefore do not spontaneously settle. However, the magnetic field and magnetic field gradient required to remove such particles from solution are so large as to require heavy and bulky magnets for their generation, which are inconvenient to use in bench top work. Magnets capable of generating magnetic fields in excess of 397887.5 A m 5000 Oersteds are typically required to separate magnetic particles of less than 0.03 µm in diameter. An approximate quantitative relationship between the net force F acting on a particle and the magnetic field is given by the equation below Hirschbein Magnetic particles of less than 0.03 µm are used in so called ferrofluids, which are described, for example, in U.S. patent No. 3,531,413. Ferrofluids have numerous applications, but are impractical for applications requiring separation of the magnetic particles from surrounding media because of the large magnetic fields and magnetic field gradients required to effect the separations. Ferromagnetic materials in general become permanently magnetized in reponse to magnetic fields. Materials termed superparamagnetic experience a force in a magnetic field gradient, but do not become permanently magnetized. Crystals of magnetic iron oxides may be either ferromagnetic or superparamagnetic, depending on the size of the crystals. Superparamagnetic oxides of iron generally result when the crystal is less than about 300 Å 0.03 µm in diameter larger crystals generally have a ferromagnetic character. Following initial exposure to a magnetic field, ferromagnetic particles tend to aggregate because of magnetic attraction between the permanently magnetized particles, as has been noted by Robinson Dispersible magnetic iron oxide particles reportedly having 300 Å 0.03µm diameters and surface amine groups were prepared by base precipitation of ferrous chloride and ferric chloride Fe² Fe³ 1 in the presence of polyethylene imine, according to Rembaum in U.S. Pat. No. 4,267,234. Reportedly, these particles were exposed to a magnetic field three times during preparation and were described as redispersible. The magnetic particles were mixed with a glutaraldehyde suspension polymerization system to form magnetic polyglutaraldehyde microspheres with reported diameters of 0.1 µm. Polyglutaraldehyde microspheres have conjugated aldehyde groups on the surface which can form bonds to amino containing molecules such as proteins. However, in general, only compounds which are capable of reacting with aldehyde groups can be directly linked to the surface of polyglutaraldehyde microspheres. Moreover, magnetic polyglutaraldehyde microspheres are not sufficiently stable for certain applications. Radioimmunoassay RIA is a term used to describe methods for analyzing the concentrations of substances involving a radioactively labeled substance which binds to an antibody. The amount of radioactivity bound is altered by the presence of an unlabeled test substance capable of binding to the same antibody. The unlabeled substance, if present, competes for binding sites with the labeled substance and thus decreases the amount of radioactivity bound to the antibody. The decrease in bound radioactivity can be correlated to the concentration of the unlabeled test substance by means of a standard curve. An essential step of RIA is the separation of bound and free label which must be accomplished in order to quantitate the bound fraction. A variety of conventional separation approaches have been applied to radioimmunoassays RIA including coated tubes, particulate systems, and double antibody separation methods. Coated tubes, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,646,346, allow separation of bound and free label without centrifugation but suffer from two major disadvantages. First, the surface of the tube limits the amount of antibody that can be employed in the reaction. Second the antibody is far removed as much as 0.5 cm from some antigen, slowing the reaction between the antibody and antigen G.M. Parsons, in Methods in Enzymology, J. Langone ed. Antibodies have been attached to particulate systems to facilitate separation see, e.g., U.S. Pats. Nos. 3,652,761 and 3,555,143 . Such systems have large surface areas permitting nearly unlimited amounts of antibody to be used, but the particulates frequently settle during the assay. The tube frequently must be agitated to achieve even partial homogeneity P.M. Jacobs, The Ligand Quarterly, Antibodies may react with labeled and unlabeled molecules followed by separation using a second antibody raised to the first antibody Id. . The technique, termed the double antibody method, achieves homogeneity of antibody during reaction with label but requires an incubation period for reaction of first and second antibodies followed by a centrifugation to pellet the antibodies. Antibodies have been attached to magnetic supports in an effort to eliminate the centrifugation steps in radioimmunoassays for nortriptyline, methotrexate, digoxin, thyroxine and human placental lactogen R.S. Kamel Such methods suffer from large particle sizes 10 100 µm in diameter and require agitation to keep the antibody dispersed during the assay. Since substantial separation occurs from spontaneous settling in the absence of a magnetic field these previous methods are in fact only magnetically assisted gravimetric separations. The problem of settling was addressed by Davies and Janata whose approach in U.S. Pat. No. 4,177,253 was to employ magnetic particles comprising low density cores of materials such as hollow glass or polyproplyene 4 10 µm in diameter with magnetic coatings 2 µm 10 µm thick covering a proportion of the particle surface. Anti estradiol antibodies were coupled to such particles and their potential usefulness in estradiol RIAs was demonstrated. While this approach may have overcome the problem of settling, the particle size and the magnetic coating nonetheless present limitations on surface area and hence limitations on the availability of sites for antibody coupling. Magnetic separations have been applied in other biological systems besides RIA. Several nonisotopic immunoassays, such as fluoroimmunoassays FIA and enzyme immunoassays EIA have been developed which employ antibody coupled or antigen coupled magnetic particles. The principle of competitive binding is the same in FIA and EIA as in RIA except that fluorophores and enzymes, respectively, are substituted for radioisotopes as label. By way of illustration, M. Pourfarzaneh A non competitive solid phase sandwich technique EIA for the measurement of IgE was described by J. L. Guesdon A magnetizable solid phase non immune radioassay for vitamin B₁₂ has been reported by D.S. Ithakissios and D.O. Kubiatowicz Clin. Chem. In addition to their use in the solid phase biological assays just described, magnetic particles have been used for a variety of other biological purposes. Magnetic particles have been used in cell sorting systems to isolate select viruses, bacteria and other cells from mixed populations U.S. Pats. Nos. 3,970,518 4,230,685 and 4,267,234, hereby incorporated by reference .

No. 3,652,761 as an organofunctional and silicon functional silicon compound characterized in that the silicon portion of the molecule has an affinity for inorganic materials while the organic portion of the molecule is tailored to combine with organics. Silanes are suitable coating materials for metal oxide cores by virtue of their silicon functionalities and can be coupled to bioaffinity adsorbents through their organofunctionalities. For example, the polymeric silane coat is covalently coupled to antibodies selected from the group defined in claim 9. The term superparamagnetism is defined as that magnetic behavior exhibited by iron oxides with crystal size less than about 300 Å 0.03 µm , which behavior is characterized by responsiveness to a magnetic field without resultant permanent magnetization.

Label may be in the antigen, the antibody, or in double antibody methods, the second antibody.

The term immobilized enzyme reaction is defined as any enzymatically catalyzed biochemical conversion or synthesis or degradation wherein the enzyme molecule or active site thereof is not freely soluble but is adsorptively or covalently bound to a solid phase support, which support is suspended in or contacted with the surrounding medium and which may be reclaimed or separated from said medium.

This invention provides novel magnetic particles useful in biological applications involving the separation of molecules from or the directed movement of molecules in the surrounding medium. Methods and compositions for preparing and using the magnetic particles are provided. The present invention provides a magnetically responsive particle as claimed in claim 1. The magnetic particles comprise a magnetic metal oxide core generally surrounded by an adsorptively or covalently bound silane coat to which a wide variety of bioaffinity adsorbents can be covalently bonded through selected coupling chemistries. The magnetic metal oxide core preferably ioncludes a group of superparamagnetic iron oxide crystals, the coat is preferably a silane polymer and the coupling chemistries include, but are not limited to, diazotization, carbodiimide and glutaraldehyde couplings. The magnetic particles produced by the method described herein can remain dispersed in an aqueous medium for a time sufficient to permit the particles to be used in a number of assay procedures. The particles are preferably between about 0.1 and about 1.5 µm in diameter. Remarkably, preferred particles of the invention with mean diameters in this range can be produced with a surface area as high as about 100 to 150 m² gm, which provides a high capacity for bioaffinity adsorbent coupling. Magnetic particles of this size range overcome the rapid settling problems of larger particles, but obviate the need for large magnets to generate the magnetic fields and magnetic field gradients required to separate smaller particles. Magnets used to effect separations of the magnetic particles of this invention need only generate magnetic fields between about 7957,75 and about 79577,5 A m between 100 and 1000 Oersteds . Such fields can be obtained with permanent magnets which are preferably smaller than the container which holds the dispersion of magnetic particles and thus, may be suitable for benchtop use. Although ferromagnetic particles may be useful in certain applications of the invention, particles with superparamagnetic behavior are usually preferred since superparamagnetic particles do not exhibit the magnetic aggregation associated with ferromagnetic particles and permit redispersion and reuse. The method for preparing the magnetic particles may comprise precipitating divalent and trivalent metal salts in base to form fine magnetic metal oxide crystals, redispersing and washing the crystals in water and in an electrolyte. Magnetic separations may be used to collect the crystals between washes if the crystals are superparamagnetic. The crystals may then be coated with a material capable of adsorptively or covalently bonding to the metal oxide and bearing organic functionalities for coupling with bioaffinity adsorbents. In one embodiment the coating around the metal oxide core is a polymer of silane. The silanization may be performed by redispersing the magnetic metal oxide crystals in an acidic organic solution, adding an organosilane, dehydrating by heating in the presence of a wetting agent miscible both in water and the organic solution, and washing the resulting magnetic silanized metal oxides. Alternatively, silanization may be performed in acidic aqueous solution. The magnetic particles of this invention can be covalently bonded by conventional coupling chemistries to bioaffinity adsorbents including, but not limited to, antibodies, antigens and specific binding proteins, which coupled magnetic particles can be used in immunoassays or other binding assays for the measurement of analytes in solution. Such assays preferably comprise mixing a sample containing an unknown concentration of analyte with a known amount of labeled analyte in the presence of magnetic particles coupled to a bioaffinity adsorbent capable of binding to or interacting with both unlabeled and labeled analyte, allowing the binding or interaction to occur, magnetically separating the particles, measuring the amount of label associated with the magnetic particles and or the amount of label free in solution and correlating the amount of label to a standard curve constructed similarly to determine the concentration of analyte in the sample. The magnetic particles of this invention are suitable for use in immobilized enzyme systems, particularly where enzyme recycling is desired. Enzymatic reactions are preferably carried out by dispersing enzyme coupled magnetic particles in a reaction mixture containing substrate s , allowing the enzymatic reaction to occur, magnetically separating the enzyme coupled magnetic particle from the reaction mixture containing product s and unreacted substrate s and, if desired, redispersing the particles in fresh substrate s thereby reusing enzyme. Affinity chromatography separations and cell sorting can be performed using the magnetic particles of this invention, preferably by dispersing bioaffinity adsorbent coupled magnetic particles in solutions or suspensions containing molecules or cells to be isolated and or purified, allowing the bioaffinity adsorbent and the desired molecules or cells to interact, magnetically separating the particles from the solutions or suspension and recovering the isolated molecules or cells from the magnetic particles. It is further contemplated that the magnetic particles of this invention can be used in The magnetic particles of this invention overcome problems associated with the size, surface area, gravitational settling rate and magnetic character of previously developed magnetic particles. Gravitational settling times in excess of about 1.5 hours can be achieved with magnetic particles of the invention, where the gravitational settling time is defined to be the time for the turbidity of a dispersion of particles of the invention in the absence of a magnetic field to fall by fifty percent. Magnetic separation times of less than about ten minutes can be achieved with magnetic particles of the invention by contacting a vessel containing a dispersion of the particles with a pole face of a permanent magnet no larger in volume than the volume of the vessel, where the magnetic separation time is defined to be the time for the turbidity of the dispersion to fall by 95 percent. Furthermore, the use of silane as the coating surrounding the metal oxide core of the magnetic particles described herein makes possible the coupling of a wide variety of molecules under an equally wide variety of coupling conditions compared to other magnetic particle coatings known in the art with more limited coupling functionalities. Preferred magnetically responsive particles of the invention have metal oxide cores comprised of clusters of superparamagnetic crystals, affording efficient separation of the particles in low magnetic fields 7957,75 79577,5 A m 100 1000 Oersteds while maintaining superparamagnetic properties. Aggregation of particles is controlled during particle synthesis to produce particles which are preferably small enough to avoid substantial gravitational settling over times sufficient to permit dispersions of the particles to be used in an intended biological assay or other application. The advantage of having superparamagnetic cores in magnetically responsive particles is that such particles can be repeatedly exposed to magnetic fields. Because they do not become permanently magnetized and therefore do not magnetically aggregate, the particles can be redispersed and reused. Even after silanization, preferred particles of the invention having cores made up of clusters of crystals exhibit a remarkably high surface area per unit weight and a generally correspondingly high coupling capacity, which indicates that such particles have an open or porous structure. None of the prior art magnetic particles used in the biological systems described in Section 2 above have the same composition, size, surface area, coupling versatility, settling properties and magnetic behavior as the magnetic particles of the invention. The magnetic particles of this invention are suitable for many of the assays, enzyme immobilization, cell sorting and affinity chromatography procedures reported in the literature and, in fact, overcome many of the problems associated with particle settling and reuse experienced in the past with such procedures. FIG. 1 is a graphical representation of the change in turbidity concentration of a suspension of magnetic particles in the presence and absence of a magnetic field as a function of time. FIG. 2 is a photomicrograph of superparamagnetic particles silanized with 3 aminopropyltrimethoxy silane. Preferred magnetic particles of the invention may be made in two steps. First, superparamagnetic iron oxides are made by precipitation of divalent Fe² and trivalent Fe³ iron salts, e.g., FeCl₂ and FeCl₃, in base. Secondly an organosilane coating is applied to the iron oxide. The ratio of Fe² and Fe³ can be varied without substantial changes in the final product by increasing the amount of Fe² while maintaining a constant molar amount of iron. The preferred Fe² Fe³ ratio is 2 1 but an Fe² Fe³ ratio of 4 1 also works satisfactorily in the procedure of Section 7.1 See also Section 7.7 . An Fe² Fe³ ratio of 1 2 produces magnetic particles of slightly inferior quality to those resulting from the higher Fe² Fe³ ratios. This magnetic oxide tends to bleed or become soluble during the rinsing procedure of Section 7.1 and the particle size is more heterogeneous than the resulting from Fe² Fe³ of 2 1 or 4 1. Nevertheless, it can be silanized to yield a usable magnetic particle as demonstrated in Section 7.7. Aqueous solutions of the iron salts are mixed in a base such as sodium hydroxide which results in the formation of a crystalline precipitate of superparamagnetic iron oxide. The precipitate is washed repeatedly with water by magnetically separating it and redispersing it until a neutral pH is reached. The precipitate is then washed once in an electrolytic solution, e.g. a sodium chloride solution. The electrolyte wash step is important to insure fineness of the iron oxide crystals. Finally the precipitate is washed with methanol until a residue of 1.0 V V water is left. The repeated use of magnetic fields to separate the iron oxide from suspension during the washing steps is facilitated by superparamagnetism. Regardless of how many times the particles are subjected to magnetic fields, they never become permanently magnetized and consequently can be redispersed by mild agitation. Permanently magnetized ferromagnetic metal oxides cannot be prepared by this washing procedure as they tend to magnetically aggregate after exposure to magnetic fields and cannot be homogeneously redispersed. Other divalent transition metal salts such as magnesium, manganese, cobalt, nickel, zinc and copper salts may be substituted for iron II salts in the precipitation procedure to yield magnetic metal oxides. For example, the substitution of divalent cobalt chloride CoCl₂ for FeCl₂ in the procedure of Section 7.1 produced ferromagnetic metal oxide particles. Ferromagnetic metal oxides such as that produced with CoCl₂, may be washed in the absence of magnetic fields by employing conventional techniques of centrifugation or filtration between washings to avoid magnetizing the particles. As long as the resulting ferromagnetic metal oxides are of sufficiently small diameter to remain dispersed in aqueous media, they may also be silanized and coupled to bioaffinity adsorbents for use in systems requiring a single magnetic separation, e.g. certain radioimmunoassays. Ferromagnetism limits particle usefulness in those applications requiring redispersion or reuse. Magnetic metal oxides produced by base precipitation may be coated by any one of several suitable silanes, preferably by the method defined in claim 19. The silane coupling materials have two features They are able to adsorptively or covalently bind to the metal oxide and are able to form covalent bonds with bioaffinity adsorbents through organofunctionalities. When silanization is used to coat the metal oxide cores of the magnetic particles of this invention, organosilanes of the general formula R Si OX ₃ may be used wherein OX ₃ represents a trialkoxy group, typically trimethoxy or triethoxy, and R represents any aryl or alkyl or aralkyl group terminating in aminophenyl, amino, carboxylic acid, hydroxyl, sulphydryl, phenolic, aliphatic, hydrophobic or mixed function amphipathic or other organic group suitable for covalent coupling to a bioaffinity adsorbent. Such organosilanes include, but are not limited to, p aminophenyltrimethoxysilane, 3 aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, N 2 aminoethyl 3 aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, triaminofunctional silane H₂NCH₂CH₂ NH CH₂CH₂ NH CH₂CH₂ CH₂ Si OCH₃ ₃, n dodecyltriethoxysilane and n hexyltrimethoxysilane. For other possible silane coupling agents see U.S. Pat. No. 3,652,761, supra . Generally, chlorosilanes cannot be employed unless provision is made to neutralize the hydrochloric acid evolved. In one embodiment, the silane is deposited on the metal oxide core from acidic organic solution. The silanization reaction occurs in two steps. First, a trimethoxysilane is placed in an organic solvent, such as methanol, water and an acid, e.g., phosphorous acid or glacial acetic acid. It condenses to form silane polymers Secondly, these polymers associate with the metal oxide, perhaps by forming a covalent bond with surface OH groups through dehydration Adsorption of silane polymers to the metal oxide is also possible. An important aspect of the acidic organic silanization procedure of this invention is the method of dehydration used to effect the adsorptive or covalent binding of the silane polymer to the metal oxide. This association is accomplished by heating the silane polymer and metal oxide in the presence of a wetting agent miscible in both the organic solvent and water. Glycerol, with a boiling of about 290 C, is a suitable wetting agent. Heating to about 160 170 C in the presence of glycerol serves two purposes. It insures the evaporation of water, the organic solvent which may be e.g., methanol, ethanol, dioxane, acetone or other moderately polar solvents and any excess silane monomer. Moreover, the presence of glycerol prevents the aggregation or clumping and potential cross linking, of particles that is an inherent problem of other silanization techniques known in the art wherein dehydration is brought about by heating to dryness. In another embodiment an acidic aqueous silanization procedure is used to deposit a silane polymer on surface of the metal oxide core. Here, the metal oxide is suspended in an acidic pH approximately 4.5 solution of 10 silane monomer. Silanization is achieved by heating for about two hours at 90 95 C. Glycerol dehydration is again used. The presence of silane on iron oxide particles was confirmed by the following observations. First, after treatment with 6N hydrochloric acid, the iron oxide was dissolved and a white, amorphous residue was left which is not present if unsilanized iron oxide is similarly digested. The acid insoluble residue was silane. Secondly, the diazotization method of Section 7.4 permits the attachment of antibodies to the particles. Diazotization does not promote the attachment of unsilanized particles. Finally, the attachment of antibody is extremely stable, far more stable than that resulting from the adsorption of antibodies to metal oxides. An initial consideration for choosing a silane coating and the appropriate chemistry for coupling bioaffinity adsorbents to magnetic particles is the nature of the bioaffinity adsorbent itself, its susceptibilities to such factors as pH and temperature as well as the availability of reactive groups on the molecule for coupling. For instance, if an antibody is to be coupled to the magnetic particle, the coupling chemistry should be nondestructive to the immunoglobulin protein, the covalent linkage should be formed at a site on the protein molecule such that the antibody antigen interaction will not be blocked or hindered, and the resulting linkage should be stable under the coupling conditions chosen. Similarly, if an enzyme is to be coupled to the magnetic particle, the coupling chemistry should not denature the enzyme protein and the covalent linkage should be formed at a site on the molecule other than the active or catalytic site or other sites that may interfere with enzyme substrate or enzyme cofactor interactions. A variety of coupling chemistries are known in the art and have been described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,652,761, If the magnetic particles are coated by carboxy terminated silanes, bioaffinity adsorbents such as proteins and immunoglobulins can be coupled to them by first treating the particles with 3 3 dimethyl aminopropyl carbodiimide. Generally, magnetic particles coated with silanes bearing certain organofunctionalities can be modified to substitute more desirable functionalities for those already present on the surface. For example, diazo derivatives can be prepared from 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane by reaction with p nitro benzoic acid, reduction of the nitro group to an amine and then diazotization with nitrous acid. The same silane can be converted to the isothiocyanoalkylsilane derivative by reaction of the amino function group with thiophosgene. To effect coupling to the magnetic particle, an aqueous solution of a bioaffinity adsorbent can be contacted with the silane coated particle at or below room temperature. When a protein or immunoglobulin is to be coupled, generally a ratio of 1 10 1 30, mg protein mg particle is used. Contact periods of between about 3 to 24 hours are usually sufficient for coupling. During this period, the pH is maintained at a value that will not denature the bioaffinity adsorbent and which best suits the type of linkage being formed, e.g. for azo linkages, a pH of 8 9. It has been observed that after coupling of antibodies to silane coated magnetic particles by either the diazotization, carbodiimide, or glutaraldehyde methods described in greater detail in Section 7.5, 7.8 and 7.10, respectively, the antibodies remain magnetic even after the following rigorous treatments 24 hours at 50 C in phosphate buffered saline PBS , 21 days at 37 C in PBS, 30 minutes at 23 C in 1M sodium chloride, and repeated rinses in ethanol or methanol at room temperature. Antibodies adsorbed to iron oxides are substantially detached by any of these treatments. These results indicate that the silane is very tightly associated with the metal oxide and that the coupling of antibody to the particle results from an essentially irreversible covalent coupling. The tight association of the silane to the metal oxide together with the covalent coupling of bioaffinity adsorbents e.g., antibodies are features which impart stability onto coupled magnetic particles, a commercially important attribute. The magnetic particles of this invention may be used in immunoassays and other binding assays as defined in Section 3. The most prevalent types of assays used for diagnostic and research purposes are radioimmunoassays, fluoroimmunoassays, enzyme immunoassays, and non immune radioassays, based on the principle of competitive binding. Basically, a ligand, such as an antibody or specific binding protein, directed against a ligate, such as an antigen, is saturated with an excess of labeled ligate ligate . Alternatively, competitive assays may be run with labeled ligand and unlabeled ligate. Non competitive assays, so called sandwich assays, are also widely employed. By the method of this invention, the ligand is coupled to a magnetic particle. Examples of labels are radioisotopes tritium, ¹⁴ carbon, ⁵⁷ cobalt and, preferably, ¹²⁵ iodine fluorometric labels rhodamine or fluorescein isothiocyanate and enzymes generally chosen for the ease with which the enzymatic reaction can be measured alkaline phosphatase or β D galactosidase. If nonlabeled ligate is added to ligand along with ligate, less ligate will be found in the ligand ligate complex as the ratio of unlabeled to labeled ligate increases. If the ligand ligate complex can be physically separated from ligate, the amount of unlabeled ligate in a test substance can be determined. To measure unlabeled ligate, a standard curve must be constructed. This is done by mixing a fixed amount of ligand and ligate and adding a known amount of unlabeled ligate to each. When the reaction is complete, the ligand ligate is separated from ligate. A graph is then made that relates the label in the collected ligand ligate complex to the amount of added unlabeled ligate. To determine the amount of unlabeled ligate in an experimental sample, an aliquot of the sample is added to the same ligand ligate mixture used to obtain the standard curve. The ligand ligate complex is collected and the label measured, and the amount of unlabeled ligand is read from the standard curve. This is possible with any sample, no matter how complex, as long as nothing interferes with the ligand ligate interaction. By the method of this invention, the ligand ligate complex is separated magnetically from free ligate. This general methodology can be applied in assays for the measurement of a wide variety of compounds including hormones, pharmacologic agents, vitamins and cofactors, hematological substances, virus antigens, nucleic acids, nucleotides, glycosides and sugars. By way of illustration, the compounds listed in Table I are all measurable by magnetic particles immunoassays and binding assays see D. Freifelder, Physical Biochemistry Applications to Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, P. 259, W.H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco 1976 . Thus, for example, antibodies against these antigenic species may be employed as ligands in the present methods. Other suitable ligands which may be adapted for use in the present invention are readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Enzymes may be coupled to the magnetic particles of this invention by the methods described in Section 6.2. They may be used in immobilized enzyme systems, particularly in batch reactors or continuous flow stirred tank reactors CSTR , to facilitate separation of enzyme from product after the reaction has occurred and to permit enzyme reuse and recycle. A method for using enzyme coupled magnetic particles in biochemical reactions was described by Dunnill and Lilly in U.S. Pat. No. 4,152,210, The process of affinity chromatography enables the efficient isolation of molecules by making use of features unique to the molecule the ability to recognize or be recognized with a high degree of selectivity by a bioaffinity adsorbent such as an enzyme or antibody and the ability to bind or adsorb thereto. The process of affinity chromatography simply involves placing a selective bioaffinity adsorbent or ligand in contact with a solution containing several kinds of substances including the desired species, the ligate. The ligate is selectively adsorbed to the ligand, which is coupled to an insoluble support or matrix. The nonbinding species are removed by washing. The ligate is then recovered by eluting with a specific desorbing agent, e.g. a buffer at a pH or ionic strength that will cause detachment of the adsorbed ligate. By the method of this invention, magnetic particles may be used as the insoluble support to which the ligand is coupled. The particles may be suspended in batch reactors containing the ligate to be isolated. The particles with bound ligate may be separated magnetically from the bulk fluid and washed, with magnetic separations between washes. Finally, the ligate can be recovered from the particle by desorption. The magnetic particles of this invention may be used in a variety of affinity systems exemplified by those listed in Table III. The metal oxide particles were prepared by mixing a solution of iron II Fe² and iron III Fe³ salts with base as follows a solution that is 0.5M ferrous chloride FeCl₂ and 0.25M ferric chloride FeCl₃ 200 mls was mixed with 5M sodium hydroxide NaOH 200 mls at 60 C by pouring both solutions into a 500 ml beaker containing 100 mls of distilled water. All steps were performed at room temperature unless otherwise indicated. The mixture was stirred for 2 minutes during which time a black, magnetic precipitate formed. After settling, the volume of the settled precipitate was approximately 175 mls. The concentration of iron oxide in the precipitate was about 60 mg ml based on a yield of 11.2 gms of iron oxide as determined The precipitate was then washed with water until a pH of 6 8 was reached as determined by pH paper. The following washing technique was employed The water was then replaced with methanol, leaving a trace of water to catalyze hydrolysis of the methoxy silane see Section 7.2. . This was accomplished by aspirating 800 mls of 0.2M NaCl and bringing the total volume to 1 liter with methanol. The material was resuspended, and magnetically extracted 800 mls of supernatant were removed, and another 800 mls of methanol were added. After three additions of methanol, the oxide was ready for silanization in a solution which was approximately 1 V V water. A portion of the precipitate was dried at 70 C for 24 hours and weighed 11.2 grams of magnetic iron oxide were formed. It is to be noted that throughout this procedure the magnetic iron oxide particles, because of their superparamagnetic properties, never became permanently magnetized despite repeated exposure to magnetic fields. Consequently, only mild agitation was required to resuspend the particles during the water washings and methanol replacement treatment. The magnetic iron oxide particles see Section 7.1. suspended in 250 mls of methanol containing approximately 1 V V water were placed in a Virtis 23 homogenizer Virtis Company, Inc., Gardiner, NY . Two grams of orthophosphorous acid Fisher Scientific Co., Pittsubrgh, PA and 10 mls of p aminophenyltrimethoxy silane A 7025, Petrarch Systems, Inc., Bristol, PA were added. In an alternative protocol, 5 mls of glacial acetic acid have been substituted for the 2 gms of orthophosphorous acid. The mixture was homogenized at 23,000 rpm for 10 minutes and at 9,000 rpm for 120 minutes. The contents were poured into a 500 ml glass beaker containing 200 mls of glycerol and heated on a hot plate until a temperature of 160 170 C was reached. The mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature. Both the heating and cooling steps were performed under nitrogen with stirring. The glycerol particle slurry about 200 mls in volume was poured into 1.5 liters of water in a 2 liter beaker the particles were washed exhaustively usually four times with water according to the technique described in section 7.1. This silanization procedure was performed with other silanes, including 3 aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, N 2 aminoethyl 3 aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, n dodecyltriethoxysilane and n hexyltrimethoxysilane A 0800, A 0700, D 6224 and H 7334, respectively, Petrarch Systems, Inc., Bristol, PA . As an alternative to the above silanization procedure, silane has also been deposited on superparamagnetic iron oxide as prepared in Section 7.1 from acidic aqueous solution. Superparamagnetic iron oxide with Fe² Fe³ ratio of 2 was washed with water as described in Section 7.1. The transfer to methanol was omitted. One gram of particles about 20 mls of settled particles was mixed with 100 mls of a 10 solution of 3 aminopropyltrimethoxysilane in water. The pH was adjusted to 4.5 with glacial acetic acid. The mixture was heated at 90 95 C for 2 hours while mixing with a metal stirblade attached to an electric motor. After cooling, the particles were washed 3 times with water 100 mls , 3 times with methanol 100 mls and 3 times with water 100 mls , and the presence of silane on the particles was confirmed. The mean particle diameter as measured by light scattering and the surface area per gram as measured by nitrogen gas adsorption for p aminophenyl silanized, 3 aminopropyl silanized, and N 2 aminoethyl 3 aminopropyl silanized particles are summarized in Table IV. The particle surface area is closely related to the capacity of the particles to bind protein as much as 300 mg gm of protein can be coupled to the N 2 aminoethyl 3 aminopropyl silanized particle, far higher than previously reported values of 12 mg protein gm of particles Hersh and Yaverbaum, Clin. Chem. Acta Because the mean diameters of the silanized magnetic particles produced by the procedures of Sections 7.1 and 7.2 are considerably smaller than the diameters of other magnetic particles described in the literature, they exhibit slower gravimetric settling times than those previously reported. For instance, the settling time of the particles described herein in approximately 150 minutes in contrast to settling times of a 5 minutes for the particles of Hersh and Yaverbaum Clin. Chem. Acta The silanized magnetic particles of this invention are characterized by very slow rates of gravimetric settling as a result of their size and composition nevertheless they respond promptly to weak magnetic fields. This is depicted in FIG. 1 where the change in turbidity over time of a suspension of silanized magnetic particles resulting from spontaneous particle settling in the absence of a magnetic field is compared to the change in the turbidity produced in the presence of a samarium cobalt magnet. It can be seen that after 30 minutes the turbidity of the suspension has changed only slightly more than 10 in the absence of a magnetic field. However, in the presence of a weak magnetic field, the turbidity of the particle suspension drops by more than 95 of its original value within 6 minutes. In another experiment, a decrease in turbidity of only about 4 in 30 minutes was observed. A photomicrograph of superparamagnetic particles silanized with 3 aminotrimethoxysilanes SIN particles is shown in FIG. 2. It can be seen that the particles vary in shape and size and that they are made up of a groups or clusters of individual superparamagnetic crystals less than 300 Å 0.03µm which appear roughly spherical in shape. First, thyroxine T₄ antiserum was prepared as follows 5.0 mls of serum of sheep immunized with T₄ obtained from Radioassay Systems Laboratories, Inc., Carson, CA were added to a 50 ml centrifuge tube. Two 5.0 ml aliquots of phosphate buffered saline PBS were added to the tube followed by 15 mls of 80 saturated ammonium sulfate, pH 7.4, at 4 C. After mixing, the tube was stored at 4 C for 90 minutes. The mixture was then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4 C. The supernatant fraction was decanted and the pellet resuspended and dissolved to clarity in 5.0 mls of PBS. The T₄ antiserum preparation 1 2 in PBS was dialyzed against PBS, transferred from the dialysis tubing to a 50 ml centrifuge tube to which 40 mls of PBS were added, bringing the total volume to 50 mls. The T₄ antiserum preparation 1 10 in PBS was refrigerated until used for coupling. To 1740 mg of p aminophenyl silanized particles in 100 mls of 1N hydrochloric acid HCl , 25 mls of 0.6M sodium nitrite NaNO₂ were added. The NaNO₂ was added slowly below the surface of the particle HCl mixture while maintaining the temperature between 0 and 5 C with care taken to avoid freezing. After 10 minutes, the mixture was brought to pH 7.5 8.5 by addition of 65 mls of 1.2M NaOH and 18 mls of 1M sodium bicarbonate NaHCO₃ , still maintaining temperature at 0 to 5 C. . Then, 50 mls of PBS containing 100 mg of the gamma globulin fraction of sheep serum containing antibodies to thyroxine the T₄ antiserum preparation described The quantity of antibody coupled magnetic particles to be used in the thyroxine radioimmunoassay RIA was determined empirically using the following RIA procedure The reagents used in the assay were as follows Having thus determined the optimal quantity, the RIA procedure described Rabbit anti theophylline antibodies were prepared and coupled to p aminophenyl silanized particles according to methods similar to those described in Section 7.4. The anti theophylline antibody coupled magnetic particles were used in a radioimmunoassay with the following protocol 20 µls of theophylline standard obtained by adding theophylline to theophylline free human serum , 100 µls of ¹²⁵I theophylline tracer obtained from Clinical Assays, Cambridge, MA , and 1 ml of antibody coupled magnetic particles were vortexed. After a 15 minute incubation at room temperature, a 10 minute magnetic separation was employed. A standard curve was constructed and the data obtained are shown in Table VI. Magnetic iron oxides were made according to the crystallization procedure of Section 7.1 by maintaining constant molar amounts of iron but varying the Fe² Fe³ ratio from 4 to 0.5. These particles were silanized, coupled to anti T₄ antibodies and used in the T₄ RIA, as in Sections 7.2, 7.4 and 7.5, respectively. The variation of Fe² Fe³ ratio did not substantially affect the performance of these magnetic particles in the T₄ RIA as shown in Table VII. A superparamagnetic iron oxide was made by the procedure described in Section 7.1 and silanized as in Section 7.2 with 3 aminopropyltrimethoxysilane instead of the aminophenyl silane. The amino group of the silane was then reacted with glutaric anhydride to convert the termination from an amine to carboxylic acid. The conversion of the termination was accomplished as follows five grams of aminopropyl silanized particles in water were washed four times with 1.5 liters of 0.1M NaHCO₃ using the washing procedure of Section 7.1. The volume was adjusted to 100 mls and 2.85 gm glutaric anhydride was added. The particles were washed two times and the reaction with glutaric anhydride was repeated. The carboxylic acid terminated magnetic particles were washed five times with water to prepare them for reaction with protein. To 50 mg of carboxy terminated magnetic particles in 1 ml of water were added 4 mg of 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide. After mixing by shaking for 2 minutes, 0.05 mg of B₁₂ binding protein intrinsic factor IF from hog gut obtained from Dr. R.H. Allen, Denver, CO and 0.75 mg of human serum albumin HSA, obtained from Sigma Chemical Co., A 8763 were added to 0.30 ml in water. The pH was adjusted to pH 5.6 and maintained by the addition of 0.1N HCl or 0.1N NaOH for three hours. The particles were then washed with 10 mls of 0.1M Borate with 0.5M NaCl pH 8.3, 10 mls of phosphate buffered saline PBS with 0.1 HSA, and 10 mls of distilled water employing the magnetic separation technique as in Section 7.1. Particles were washed three times with PBS and stored in PBS until use. Using the IF and HSA coupled magnetic particles made by the method of Section 7.7, a titering of the particles was performed to ascertain the quantity of particles needed in a competitive binding assay for vitamin B₁₂ B₁₂ . The following assay protocol was used The reagents used in the assay were as follows A quantity of magnetic particles of approximately 50 µg tube was selected and was used in the B₁₂ competitive binding assay Six tenths of a gram of N 2 aminoethyl 3 aminopropyl magnetic particles abbreviated DIN particles for dinitrogen , signifying that the particles have a N Si ratio of 2 prepared as in Section 7.2. were resuspended in water. The particles were washed once in water and then twice with 30 mls of 0.1M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 with magnetic separations between washings. After suspending the washed particles in 15 mls of 0.1M phosphate, 15 mls of a 5 V V solution of glutaraldehyde, formed by diluting 25 glutaraldehyde G 5882, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO with 0.1M phosphate, were added. The particles were mixed for 3 hours at room temperature by gently rotating the reaction vessel. Unreacted glutaraldehyde was washed away with 5 additions of 30 mls of 0.1M phosphate buffer. The glutaraldehyde activated particles were then resuspended in 15 mls of 0.1M phosphate. Triiodothyronine T₃ antiserum 1.6 mls, obtained by immunizing rabbits with T₃ BSA conjugates was added to the activated particles and stirred on a wheel mixer at room temperature for 16 to 24 hours. The T₃ antibody coupled particles were washed once with 30 mls of 0.1M phosphate and suspended in 15 mls of 0.2M glycine solution in order to react any unreacted aldehyde groups. The suspension was mixed by shaking for 25 minutes. The antibody coupled particles were washed with 30 mls of 0.1 phosphate, 30 mls of ethanol and twice with 150 mls of PBS with 0.1 bovine serum albumin BSA . They were resuspended in PBS, 1 BSA and stored at 4 C until used for RIA for T₃. The coupling procedure of Section 6.10.1 was followed with minor modifications. Twenty grams of DIN particles were washed three times with 1.5 liters of methanol prior to glutaraldehyde activation. Glutaraldehyde activation was performed as in Section 7.10.1. with adjustments for scale. A goat gamma globulin fraction containing antibodies to human thyroid stimulating hormone TSH was coupled to the DIN particles rather than whole antisera. Fractionation was accomplished by precipitation of gammaglobulins with 40 ammonium sulfate followed by dialysis against PBS. Approximately 4 grams of protein 200 mls at 20 mg ml were coupled. Complete attachment of protein was evident by the absence of optical density at 280 nm in the supernatant after coupling. This indicated the attachment of about 20 mg of protein per gram of particles. The particles were then washed three times with 1.5 liters of 1M NaCl, three times with PBS and incubated at 50 C overnight. Particles were then washed 3 more times in PBS BSA and titered for use in the TSH assay. The quantity of particles to be used in the T₃ RIA was determined in the following assay The quantity of particles to be used in the TSH RIA was determined in the following assay Magnetic particles 1 gm were activated with glutaraldehyde as in Section 7.10.1. After washing, the particles were resuspended in 15 mls of PBS. Then 3 mls Of particles 2 gm were mixed with 5 mg of alkaline phosphatase Sigma Chemical Company, P 9761 or 5 mg of β galactosidase Sigma Chemical Company, 5635 dissolved in 2.0 mls of PBS. The coupled particles were washed with glycine and then washed 5 times with PBS and resuspended in PBS with 0.1 BSA. Enzyme assays for magnetic alkaline phosphatase activity was performed as follows Enzyme assay for magnetic β galactosidase activity was performed as follows
