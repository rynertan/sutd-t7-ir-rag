# Microfine fiber laminate.

## Abstract
A water impervious laminated material is described. A preferred embodiment comprises a three ply hydrophobic microfine fiber structure 20 sandwiched between and fuse bonded to two layers 10, 30 of conjugate fibers having a low melting sheath and a high melting core. The inner ply 14 of the hydrophobic microfine fiber structure 20 is relatively high melting while the two outer plies 13, 15 of the hydrophobic microfine fiber structure 20 are low melting. The sheaths of the conjugate fibers have been fuse bonded to the hydrophobic microfine fiber structure 20 at a temperature below the melt temperature of the cores of the conjugate fibers so that the cores retain their initial fiber like integrity.
