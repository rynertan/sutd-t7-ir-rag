## Description
METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION OF BENZENAMINES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a method for the preparation of benzenamines and to the preparation of phenyl carbamic fluorides, useful in the preparation of benzenamines. The benzenamines, also known as anilines and as aminobenzenes, are a known class of compounds having commercial utility as chemical intermediates, for a wide range of chemical end products. Substituted benzenamines, especially trifluoromethyl substituted benzenamines such as 2 trifluoromethyl benzenamines also known as o trifluoromethyl anilines or o aminobenzotrifluorides are particularly useful as intermediates for the preparation of various dyestuff and pesticides. For example, 2 amino 5 chlorobenzotrifluoride also known as 4 chloro 2 trifluoromethyl benzenamine , is employed commercially as a dye intermediate and is designated as C.I.Azoic Diazo Component 17, according to Colour Index,Chemical No. 37055, Vol. 1 4, 2nd ed. 1956, Suppl. 1963 published by the Society of Dyers and Colourists U.K. and TheAmerican Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists U.S. . Substituted benzenamines, such as ttlifluaromethyl benzenamines are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,243,819 to Henrick et al., as intermediates in the synthesis of amino acid esters having pesticidal properties. Thus, for example, the reference teaches the preparation of such esters by reaction of various tri,luoromethylanilines with m phenoxybenzyl a bromoisovalerate. U.S. Patent 4,316,988 to Clinton discloses the use of trifluoromethyl substituted anilines as intermediates in the synthesis of various diphenylamine products useful as rodenticides, insecticides, and arachnicides. The utility of benzenamines, including o aminobenzotrifluorides as chemical intermediates has led to the investigation and development of various methods for the preparation of these compounds. One known method for the preparation of aromatic amines, such as aniline, involves the reduction of an aromatic nitro compound. Thus, aniline may be prepared by reaction of nitrobenzene with hydrogen. McBee et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc.73, 3932 34 1951 disclose the preparation of 4 bromo 2 tri fluoromethyl anil ine by nitration of 3 bromo trifluoromethyl benzene followed by reduction of the resultant 2 nitro 5 bromo trifluoromethyl benzene. U.S. Patent 4,096,185 to Seiwell discloses the preparation of p aminobenzotrifluoride also known as 4 trifluoromethyl benzenamine by reaction of p chlorobenzotrifluoride with ammonia in a non aqueous solvent in the presence of copper compound, such as cuprous chloride and J selected salt, such 2S potassium fluoride. Forbes et al., Tetrahedron, Vol. 8, 67 72 1960 prepared o aminobenzotrifluoride by hydrogenation of 2 nitrotrifluoromethylbenzene at elevated temperatures and pressure in the presence of a Raney nickel catalyst. German Offenlegungschrift D.E. 3,017,542 to Klauke et al.discloses the preparation of o aminobenzotrifluoride by hydrogenation hydrogenolysis of 2 amino 5 chlorobenzotrifluoride. It is also known that isocyanates and carbamic acid fluorides are susceptible to hydrolysis, in a known manner, to form an amine. See Fieser and Fieser, Organic Chemistry, 3rdEd D.C. Health and Co. 1956 . However, when the reaction is run neat, substantial quantities of urea may be formed as by product. The formation of urea may be minimized, or avoided when a solvent, such as toluene, is employed, but the yields of amine are low. Although methods for the preparation of aromatic amines, such as aminobenzotrifluorides are known from the prior art, it will be appreciated that the development of improved and more economical processes is desirable. The present process for the preparation of benzenamines differs substantially from the prior art processes in the use of hydrogen fluoride and phenyl carbamic fluorides as reactants. Furthermore, the preparation of 2 trifluoro metnyl phenyl carbamic fluorides in accorXance wnth this invention, differs substantially from the prior art processes.The preparation of the phenyl carbamic fluorides by reaction of phenyl isocyanates and hydrogen fluoride is known. Buckley et al. J. Chem. Soc. 864 1945 disclose the preparation of phenyl carbamic acid fluorides by reaction of HF with various isocyanates. However, the reference provides no teaching relative to the fluorination of aromatic isocyanates bearing a haloalkyl side chain and no teaching or suggestion of the preparation of aromatic amines. The reference further discloses the treatment of phenylcarbamyl fluoride with water to result in the formation of diphenylurea. British Patent 955,898 1964 to Farbenfabriken BayerAktiengesellschaft discloses the reaction of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride with chloromethylphenyl isocyanates to produce the corresponding fluoromethylphenyl carbamic acid fluoride, or, upon subsequent heating, the corresponding isocyanate. TheBritish patent further discloses the reaction of hydrogen fluoride with 2 trichloromethyl 4 chlorophenyl isocyanate in chl orobenzene to prepare 2 trifl uoromethyl 4 chlorophenyl carbamic acid fluoride. Subsequently, Klauke, Angew. Chem.Interat. Ed. Vol. 5, No. 9, 848, 1966 , in contrast to the teachings of Brit. Pat. 955,898, stated that when o trichloromethylphenyl isocyanate undergoes chlorine fluorine exchange in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride isomerization occurs simul taneously and o N trifluoromethyl aminDtenzoXl fluoride cen be isolated, thus implying that o trifluoromethyl phenyl carbamic acid fluoride is not produced. In U.S.Patent 3,829,460 toButtner and Klauke assigned to Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, reference is made to the 1966 article and to earlier contradictory teachings and it is disclosed that when hydrogen fluoride is reacted with a trichloromethylphenyl isocyanate wherein the trichloromethyl group is in the 2 position to the isocyanate group, it is only possible to obtain the isomers, 2 N trifluoromethylamino benzoyl fluorides. British Patent 1,164,223 to Klauke et al. teaches the hydrolysis of trifluoromethylphenyl isocyanates with 90 100 percent sulfuric acid to produce the corresponding trifluoromethyl benzenamine or amino sulfate with carbon dioxide as the only byproduct. The hydrolysis of an NCO group with acid agents, such as concentrated hydrochloric acid or sulphamic acid is known Houben Weyl, Methoden der org. Chemie, 4th Edition, Vol. 11 1, page 953 . Although the utility and commercial value of aromatic amines has been generally recognized for many years and, various investigations have been made of reactions of aromatic isocyanates, including aromatic isocyanates, including aromatic isocyanates having a perchlorinated alkyl side chain, there has been no suggestion heretofore that aromatic amines can be prepared by the reaction of hydrogen fluoride with phenyl carbamic acid fluorides or their precufibt phenyl isocyanates.Furthermore, it has not been known heretofore that 2 trifluoro methyl phenyl carbamic fluorides may be conveniently prepared by the isomerization of N trifluoromethyl anthraniloyl fluorides in the presence of hydrogen fluoride. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been found that benzenamines, of the formulaEMI6.1 wherein R is chlorine, fluorine, bromine, phenyl, chlorophenyl, fluorophenyl, or bromophenylY is trifluoromethyl or difluoromethyl m is O to 2 n is O to 2 q is 1 to 2 can be prepared by A reacting hydrogen fluoride with a phenyl carbamic fluoride of the formulaEMI6.2 where q, m, n, and R are as defined above and X is trichloromethyl, tribromomethyl, trifluoromethyl, dichloromethyl, dibromomethyl or difluoromethyl with the provision that when X is trichloromethyl, tribromomethyl or trifluoromethyl, Y is trifluoromethyl and when X is dichloromethyl, dibromomethyl or difluoromethyl, Y is difluoromethyl, to produce a benzenamine hydrofluoride complex of the formulaEMI7.1 where z is about 1 to about 4 and R, Y, q, m and n are as defined above and B dissociating the benzenamine hydrofluoride complex and recovering the benzenamine. The benzenamine hydrofluoride resulting from the reaction of hydrogen fluoride with the phenyl carbamic fluoride in accordance with step A , above, is a complex of variable stoichiometry. The explanation of the variable stoichiometry of these benzenamine hydrofluoride complexes is not essential to the process of this invention or the preparation or use of such complexes. However, it may be postulated that the variable stoichiometry is a result of hydrogen bonding. The amino he complex can be dissociated by heating for example, to temperatures above 100 Celsius. However, at such temperatures the dissociation may be accompanied by undesirable reactions such as polymerization. In a Xreferfed manner the benzenamine hydrofluoride complex can be readily dissociated by conventional methods such as neutralization with caustic or the like, and the benzenamine recovered from the reaction mixture by conventional physical separation processes such as distillation or the like. The neutralization of amine hydrofluorides with KOH, NaOH or the like is disclosed by Berliner et al., Journal of Physical Chemistry, Vol. 32, 1142 1162, 1928 . Generally for the reaction of hydrogen fluoride with the phenyl carbamic fluoride, a temperature in the range of about 10 to about 1500 Celsius and preferably about 20 to about 100S Celsius is employed. The reaction may be run neat or in the presence of a carrier medium, such as methylene chloride.The reaction proceeds smoothly, without the need for a catalyst. However, if desired, a catalyst, such as a Lewis acid catalyst may be employed. The reaction of the phenyl carbamic acid fluoride with hydrogen fluoride is carried out in the presence of a stoichiometric excess of hydrogen fluoride to result in the formation of the benzenamine hydrofluoride and carbonyl fluoride as a by product. The amount of hydrogen fluoride provided to the reaction should be at least slightly in excess of the amount required for the formation of the benzenamine hydrofluoride. Preferably the amount of hydrogen fluoride will be sufficient to provide a molar ratio of hydrogen fluoride phenyl carbamic fluoride of oetween 4 1 and 30 1 or greater. It is preferred to carry out the reaction in the liquid phase either in a sealed reactor, that is, an autoclave, or at atmospheric pressure, using a cooling condenser. The phenyl carbamic fluoride reactant may be conveniently prepared by reaction of the corresponding phenyl isocyanate with hydrogen fluoride. The reaction may be carried out in the liquid or vapor phase. In the liquid phase the reaction may be carried out at atmospheric pressure, with the temperature being maintained at below the boiling point of hydrogen fluoride, or at higher pressures and temperatures under autogenous conditions. It is preferred to carry out the reaction neat.However, if desired, a carrier medium such as methylene chloride may be employed. Typically, for a liquid phase reaction, temperatures in the range of about 20D to about 1000Celsius are employed. In a vapor phase reaction the temperature will generally be above the boiling point of the reaction mixture with no practical upper limit. Typically, the vapor phase reaction is run at a temperature of about 250 to about 350 Celsius. It is preferred to carry out the reaction with at least slight stoichiometric excess of hydrogen fluoride present at all times. Although there is no practical upper limit to the molar ratio of hydrogen fluoride to organic reaction employed, a ratio between about 5 1 and about 25 1 is generally employed. It has been found that when hydrogen fluoride is reacted with a 1 isocyanato 2 triahalomethyl benzene to prepare a 2 trifluoromethyl phenyl carbamic fluoride, the in situ formation of N trifluoromethyl anthraniloyl fluoride occurs during the reaction. The anthraniloyl fluoride may be isolated and recovered. However, if left under reaction conditions, a rearrangement or isomerization of the N trifluoromethyl phenyl carbamic fluoride is formed. This intermediate formation of an N trifluoromethyl anthraniloyl fluoride and the isomerization thereof has only been found in reactions involving orthotrihalomethyl substituted phenyl isocyanates, such as 1 isocyanato 2 trihalomethyl benzene and ring substituted derivatives, and does not appear to occur in reactions involving meta or para trihalomethyl substituted phenyl i socyanates. Thus, in accordance with another aspect of the present invention, it has been found that 2 trifluoromethyl phenyl carbamic fluorides of the formulaEMI10.1 where n is O to 2 and X is independently selectee from the group fluoro , chloro , bromo , phenyl , chlorophenyl , bromophenyl , and fluorophenyl can be prepared by isotnerizing an N trifluoromethyl anthraniloyl fluoride of the formulaEMI11.1 where n and X are as defined above, in the presence of hydrogen fluoride. The isomerization of N trifluoromethyl anthraniloyl fluoride to 2 trifluoromethyl phenyl carbamic fluoride proceeds readily in the presence of hydrogen fluoride.Preferably, the hydrogen fluoride is present in an amount of about 1.5 to about 25 and most preferably about 4.0 to about 20.0 moles of hydrogen fluoride per mole of N trifluoromethyl anthraniloyl fluoride. When lesser amounts are employed the isomerization will occur, but the reaction time is much longer. Greater amounts of hydrogen fluoride may be employed, but provide no special advantage. It is preferred to carry out the isomerization in the liquid phase. The process may be carried out at atmospheric pressure, with the temperature being maintained at or below the boiling point of hydrogen fluoride, or at higher pressures and temperatures under autogenous conditions. Temperatures, for example, in the range of about 10 or less to about 53 Celsius or higher may be employed. Preferably, temperatures in the range of about 20 to about 100 Celsius are employed. The reaction may be run neat or in the presence of a carrier medium such as methylene chloride. The reaction proceeds smoothly without the need for a catalyst. However, if desired, a catalyst, such as a Lewis acid catalyst, such as antimony pentachloride, may be employed. The reactants susceptible to isomerization in accordance with this invention include N trifluoromethyl anthraniloyl fluoride as well as the various derivatives bearing ringsubstituents, such as, fluoro , chloro , bromo , phenyl , chlorophenyl , fluorophenyl , or bromophenyl . The isomerization of N trifluoronethyl anthraniloyl fluoride to 2 trifluoromethyl phenyl carbamic fluoride is of particular interest due to the utility of the latter as an intermediate for the subsequent preparation of 2 trifluoromethyl benzenamine. N trifluoromethyl anthraniloyl fluoride may be conveniently prepared by the reaction of I isocyanato 2 tri chloromethyl benzene. The reaction may be carried out in the liquid or vapor phase. In the liquid phase the reaction may be carried out at atmospheric pressure, with the temperature being maintained at or below the boiling point of hydrogen fluoride, or at higher pressures and temperatures under autogenous conditions. Typically for a liquid phase reaction, temperatures in the range of about IO to about ZDO Celsius are employed. In a vapor phase reaction the temperature will generally be above the boiling point of the reaction mixture with no practical upper limit. Typically, the vapor phase reaction is run at a temperature of about 2500 to about 3500Celsius. It is preferred to carry out the reaction of the 1 isocyanato 2 trichloromethyl benzene and hydrogen fluoride with at least a slight stoichiometric excess of hydrogen fluoride present at all times. Although there is no theoretical upper limit to the molar ratio of hydrogen fluoride to organic reaction employed, a ratio between about 4 1 and about 25 1 is generally employed. The reaction may be run neat or in the presence of a carrier medium such as methylene chloride. The N trifluoromethyl anthraniloyl fluoride reactant may be employed in substantially pure form or, conveniently, as the crude reaction product of hydrogen fluoride and 1 isocyanato2 trichloromethyl benzene as described in the preceding paragraph. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of 2 trifluoromethyl phenyl carbamic fluoride comprising A reacting 1 isocyanato2 trichloromethyl benzene with hydrogen fluoride to form N trifluoromethyl anthraniloyl fluoride and B isomerizing the N trifluoromethyl anthraniloyl fluoride in the presence of hydrogen fluoride to form 2 trifluoromethyl phenyl carbamic fluoride. The 2 trifluoromethyl phenyl carbamic fluoride resulting from the isomerization step of this invention may be recovered from the crude reaction product in relatively pure form by conventional physical separation means, such as distillation.Alternatively, if the 2 trifluoromethyl phenyl carbamic fluoride is to be employed as a chemical intermediate for the preparation of 2 trifluoromethyl benzenamine, or the hydrofluoride salt thereof, it may be employed in the crude form, without purification or separation from the reaction mixture.In this instance, the crude 2 trifluoromethyl phenyl carbamic fluoride product of the isomerization step is further reacted with hydrogen fluoride to form the hydrofluoride salt or complex of 2 trifluoromethyl benzenamine. Thus, the phenyl carbamic fluoride reactant may be employed in substantially pure form or as the crude product of the reaction of hydrogen fluoride and a phenyl isocyanate prepared as described above. Thus, in one aspect, this invention provides a process for the preparation of benzenamine which comprises reacting a phenyl isocyanate with hydrogen fluoride to form a phenyl carbamic acid fluoride and continuing the reaction of the phenyl carbamic acid fluoride with hydrogen fluoride to produce the benzenamine. In another aspect of the present invention, it has been found surprisingly that the reaction of a phenyl carbamic fluoride with hydrogen fluoride to form the benzamine hydrofluoride, may be accelerated by the addition of water to the reaction mixture. The amount of water added to the reaction mixture is not critical and will be effective even in trace amounts. Typically, the amount of water employed will be in the range Qf about 0.001 to about 2.0 moles of water per mole of phenyl carbamic fluoride.Thus, in a preferred embodiment of this invention, the reaction of hydrogen fluoride with phenyl carbamic fluoride is carried out in the presence of 4 to about 30 moles of hydrogen fluoride per mole of phenyl carbamic fluoride, and in the further presence of about 0.001 to about 2.0 moles of water per mole of phenyl carbamic fluoride to form the corresponding benzenamine hydrofluoride. The following specific examples are provided to further illustrate this invention and the manner in which it may be carried out. It will be understood, however, that the specific details given in the examples have been chosen for purpose of illustration and are not to be construed as a limitation on the invention. In the examples1 unless otherwise indicated, all parts and percentages are by weight and all temperatures are in degrees Celsius.Examples 1 6 Preparation of 2 Trifluoromethyl Benzenamine from 2 Trifluoromethyl Phenyl Carbamic FluorideExample 1 Three hundred and two parts of 2 trifluoromethyl phenyl carbamic fluoride was charged to a polytetrafluoroethylene reaction vessel and maintained at ODC while 420 parts of liquid hydrogen fluoride was added.
