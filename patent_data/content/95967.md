## Description
DISC BRAKE ASSEldsBLY This invention relates to a disc brake assembly, and, more particularly to a rail slider disc brake wherein a pair of torque member arms movably support a caliper assembly. A disc brake assembly comprises a torque member fixedly disposed adjacent a rotor to be braked and including a pair of arms extending axially over the periphery of the rotor, a caliper assembly movably carried by the pair of arms and cooperating with a pair of friction elements to urge the latter into engagement with the rotor during braking, and the caliper assembly including a pair of axially extending grooves for receiving the pair of arms. In United States Patent 3,998,296 a caliper assembly supports an outer shoe by means of gripping flanges on the outer shoe in engagement with surfaces machined on the caliper housing. In view of the double location for the gripping flanges, the caliper housing requires machining at several locations to permit attachment of the outer shoe thereto. The present invention is characterized by one of said pair of grooves including a slot and one of said pair of friction elements is received within said slot and disposed in abutting relation with the wall of said one groove in order to attach said one friction element to soicl caliper assembly. It is an advantage ol the present invention that a groove required on the caliper assembly for slidably supporting the latter is utilized to support a friction clement and the groove is slotted to permit ready engagement of the friction element to the caliper assembly. The inventions will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein Figure 1 is a side view of a disc brake assembly constructed in accordance with the. present invention Figure 2 is a view taken along line 2 2 of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a cross sectional view taken along line 3 3 of Figure 1 Figure 4 is a right side view of Figure 1 showing only the caliper assembly and Figure 5 is a front view of Figure 1 showing only the outer friction element. in 5 m i 10 a trr fixedly disposed adjacent a rotor ilt, The t r u member 1 includes a first portion 16 extending parallel to the rotor 14 and a pair of arms 18 and 0 extend from the first portion 16 over the perIphery of the rotor li in a normal direction. The orque member defines a circumferentially extending recess 32 for receiving a caliper assembly 24.The caliper assembly carries a hydraulic actuator 26 on one side ot tne rotor 14 and extends to the other side of the rotor to include a reaction leg 28. During braking the hydraulic actuator 26 receives fluid pressure to directly urge an inner friction element 30 into engagement with the rotor 14. A reaction force generated by the friction element 30 biases the caliper assembly 24 to move an outer friction element 32 into engagement with the rotor 14. The caliper assembly 24 defines a pair of recesses or grooves 34 and 36 extending axially from the hyaraulic actuator 26 to the reaction leg 28. The recesses 34 and 36 are substantiallyV shaped with a radially outer surface and a radially inner surface. The recess 34 receives the torque member arm 18 and the recess 36 receives the torque meter arm 20. In order to accommodate manufacturing tolerances and assist in movably supporting the caliper assembly 24 relative to the torque member 12, the arm 18 includes a key assembly 38 comprising a plate 40 secured via bolt 42 to the arm 18 and a lear spring 44 carried within a plate groove 46 to slideably engage the outer surface of recess 34. In accordance with the invention, the axially extending recesses 34 and 36 are provided with slots 50 and 52, slot 50 being more clearly illustrated in Figures 2 and 4. The. outer friction element 32 includes a backing plate 54 which carries a friction pad 56 engageable with the rotor 14. The backing plate includes a pair of ears 58 and 60 which extend radially outwardly past the friction pad and circumferentially toward each other. The ears 58 and 60 fit into the slots 50 and 52, respectively, to engage the surfaces of the recesses 34 and 36. The slots 50 and 52 are adjacent but slightly spaced from the leg 28 to permit the ears to move within the recesses to abut the backing plate 54 with the leg 28 and space the ears from the slots.Also, the backing plate 54 is provided with a pair of projections 62 and 64 and the leg 28 is provided with a pair of steps 66 and 68 so that when the friction element 32 is moved rnto engagement with the leg 28, the projection 62 and 64 fit into the steps to abut the surfaces of the steps. Consequently, the ears 58 and 60 cooperate with the recesses 34 and 36 and the projections 62 and 64 cooperate with the steps 66 and 68 to connect the outer friction element with the caliper assembly. The inner friction element 30 is carried by the torque member 12 in a conventional manner so that braking torque developed by the inner friction element is transmitted directly to the torque member while braking torque developed by the outer friction element is transmitted to the caliper assembly. In particular, if arm 18 is the leading arm, the backing plate ear 58 will be forced into abutting engagement with the outer surface of recess 34 and the backing plate projection 64 will be forced into abutting engagement with the verticle surface of step 68. Consequently, the braking torque transmitted to the caliper assombly is spilt between a leading portion of the caliper assembly at recess 34 and a trailing portion of the caliper assembly at step 68.The leading portion is in radial alignment with the arans 18 and 20 and the trailing portion is substantially located at the radially inner edge of the leg 28. Turning to Figure 5, the outer friction element 32 vertically aligns tile pair of projections 62 and 64 with the pair of ears 58 and 60. In order to align these parts, the ears 58 and 60 include arcuatc edges 72 and 711 which align radially with the arms 18 and 20, respectively when the outer friction element 32 is attached to the caliper assembly. The arms define cut outs 76 and 78 which receive tho rnilially inner surface portions of the caliper assembly defining the recesses 34 and 36. Viewing Figure 2, when the outer friction element 32 is worn, the caliper assembly 24 moves relative to the torque member to an adjusted position. In the adjusted position the arm 18 over leps the slot 50 and the arm 20 overlaps the slot 52. Therefore, replacement of the worn outer friction element requires that the caliper assembly be returned to its original position to permit the outer friction element to be withdrawn from the recesses 34 and 36 via slots 50 and 52. However as the outer friction ele nnt 32 is worn, it ts aFJed in its att3ehed position to prevent diss s 50 by the arms In conclusions there are marn modifications and or variations of the structure described herein which are feasible by one skilled in the art. As such, these modificat ons and or variations are included in the scope of the pp ded
