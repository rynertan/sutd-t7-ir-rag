## Description
The invention relates to a magnetic tape cassette apparatus, comprising a servo device 39 for positioning at least one apparatus part 6 , which servo device comprises a servo wheel 40 having at least one recessed portion 49 , which faces a motor driven wheel 45 in a rest position of the servo wheel 40 , which servo wheel further carries an eccentric cam 46 and at least one latching projection 47 , which eccentric cam 46 is subjected to a starting torque produced by spring force in the rest position of the servo wheel, which servo device further comprises a relay armature member 42 which is pivotable between a latching position and an inoperative position and which carries a soft iron element 59 which in the rest position of the servo wheel is attracted by an impulse relay 44 and thereby maintains the relay armature member 42 in the latching position, in which position a stop projection 54a on the relay armature member cooperates with the latching projection 47 the servo wheel, so that the stop projection keeps the servo wheel latched in the rest position, whilst after a brief electrical energization of the impulse relay the relay armature member is pivoted under spring force from the latching position to the inoperative position, in which inoperative position the stop projection is clear of the latching projection and, under the influence of the starting torque exerted on the eccentric cam, the servo wheel is rotated, the circumference of the servo wheel engages the motor driven wheel, and the servo wheel is driven by the motor to position the apparatus part, after which the latching projection cooperates with a reset projection 55a on the relay armature member, so that the relay armature member is returned against spring force from the inoperative position to the latching position, subsequently the latching projection again abuts against the stop projection, and the stop projection again latches the servo wheel in the rest position. The invention also relates to means for generating an electric energising signal for use in a magnetic tape cassette apparatus in accordance with the invention. A servo device using an impulse relay is known from a document published by KISHO Electronics Co., Ltd. Japan . The motor driven wheel shown therein is a gear wheel, and the servo wheel is consequently provided with teeth around its circumference. However, other cooperations between the motor driven wheel and the servo wheel are alternatively possible, e.g. a cooperation by means of friction, see DE A 2,628,287. The magnetic tape cassette apparatus proposed therein comprise a relay armature member which keeps the servo wheel latched in the rest position under the influence of an impulse relay. Such an impulse relay comprises a permanent magnet which in the latching position of the relay armature member firmly attracts this member by means of the soft iron element. Around the magnet a coil is arranged to form an electromagnet which can be connected briefly to an electric current source by means of a switch. The construction and arrangement of the electromagnet relative to the permanent magnet is such that the permanent magnet is rendered magnetically neutral while the current source is switched on. As a result of this, the relay armature member is no longer attracted and a spring can cause the relay armature member to be pivoted to the inoperative position, so that the servo wheel is released and can be rotated. The advantage of such an impulse relay is that the current source need only be switched on for a short time, which is adequate to allow the impulse relay to be rendered magnetically neutral for a short time and the relay armature member to be pivoted. This brief switching on has the advantage that the current source of the magnetic tape cassette apparatus is loaded only briefly and the impulse relay consumes only a small current. This is not only an advantage for battery powered apparatuses but it is also advantageous for modern microprocessor controlled equipment, in which such a brief energization is simple to achieve. Moreover, such an impulse relay can be of compact construction and has only a very small heat dissipation in comparison with a conventional electromagnet. The known magnetic tape cassette apparatus has the drawback that often tape spillage occurs and that the reproduced signal often contains a substantial distortion component. This can be explained as follows. If the power supply is cut off while the apparatus is, for example, in the playback mode, the magnetic tape transport which is for example effected If subsequently the power supply is restored GB A 2.126.405 discloses a magnetic tape cassette apparatus having a servo device for moving the apparatus part from a first position, corresponding to a rest position of the apparatus part, to a second position, corresponding to an operating position of the apparatus part, and back to said first position, which servo device comprises By means of this it is avoided that, when the power supply is cut off, the apparatus part for example the pressure roller or the head mounting plate carrying the pressure roller remains in said second position. To that purpose second means are proposed which at the instant at which the power supply is cut off can nevertheless supply a brief electric energizing signal, which of course is effected only if the apparatus part is in the second position and not if it is in the first position. If the apparatus part is in the first position it is obviously undesirable to generate the energizing signal. Therefore the first means are utilized to detect the position of the apparatus part. The first means may comprise a switch whose state is related to the position of the apparatus part. If the apparatus part is in the first position the switch is, for example, open and if the apparatus part is in the second position the switch is in the other state the switch is closed . The invention aims at providing a special electronic circuit for the second means that can carry out the functional behaviour in a correct and reliable way, the said circuit being very easily integrable. The magnetic tape cassette apparatus in accordance with the invention is therefore characterized in that the second means comprises a transistor 77 having its control electrode coupled to a first point at a first potential V₁ , having a first main electrode coupled to a second point at a second potential V₂ The transistor may be bipolar transistors or transistors of other types such as FETs of thyristors. Preferably the third point V₀ is at a lower potential than the first point V₁ and the second point V₂ , and the transistor is a PNP transistor 77 whose emitter and collector constitute the first main electrode and the second main electrode, respectively. Further, it is to be noted that the first point is preferably at such a potential that the transistor is cut off during normal use of the magnetic tape cassette apparatus. This means that the first point V₁ should be at a potential which is higher than or equal to the potential at the second point V₂ . This ensures that the normally cut off transistor which is advantageous in view of the power consumption, in particular in the case of the battery powered equipment is briefly turned on, at the instant at which the power supply is cut off, so that a brief electric energizing signal is generated. In a first embodiment the collector of the transistor is coupled to the base of a second transistor 82 of the NPN type The first embodiment may be characterized further in that the input 73 of the second means is coupled to the base of a fourth transistor 85 of the NPN type, whose emitter is coupled to the third point V₀ and whose collector is coupled to the base of the second transistor 82 . This can be the means of ensuring that if the apparatus part is in the first position the second means produce no energizing signal for the impulse relay when the power supply is cut off. For the same reason the second embodiment may be characterized further in that the input 73 of the second means is coupled to the base of the third transistor 94 . The magnetic tape cassette apparatus may be characterized further in that a zener diode 98 is arranged in the connection between the first point V₁ and the control electrode of the first mentioned transistor 77 . This enables the time interval between the instant at which the power supply drops and the instant at which this is detected to be varied. This may be achieved by selecting zener diodes with a certain zener voltage. Moreover, it is possible to employ power supply voltages which are rectified less effectively and therefore exhibit a substantial ripple. Preferably, the first means comprises a switch which has one terminal coupled to the third point and which has its other terminal coupled to the output of the first means, and the switch is open if the apparatus part is in the first position and closed if the apparatus part is in the second position. In this way the desired input signal for the second means is obtained. A magnetic tape cassette apparatus embodying the invention will now be described in more detail, by way of non limitative example, with reference to the accompanying drawings. The magnetic tape cassette apparatus shown in Fig. 1 comprises a deck plate 1, in which two winding spindles 2 and 3 are mounted for rotation. At their lower ends the winding spindles 2 and 3 are each connected coaxially to a turntable 4 and 5 respectively, provided with circumferential teeth. A head mounting plate 6 is guided on the deck plate 1 for rectlinear movement in directions indicated by the double arrow 7. In a manner to be described hereinafter, the head mounting plate 6 can occupy a retracted first position relative to the winding spindles and a magnetic tape cassette, not shown, mounted on said spindles, and from this position the head mounting plate can be moved to a second or a third advanced position, the distance of the head mounting plate from the winding spindles 2 and 3 being smaller in the second advanced position than in the third advanced position. The head mounting plate 6 carries two magnetic heads 8 and 9, of which the magnetic head 8 is a combined recording playback head and the magnetic head 9 is an erase head in the present embodiment. Further, a pressure roller lever 10 is mounted on the head mounting plate 6 so as to be pivotable about a spindle 11 which is secured to the upper side of the deck plate 1. At the end portion which is remote from the spindle 11 the pressure roller lever 10 carries a pressure roller 12 which in the position as shown in Fig. 6 is urged against a capstan 13. This is in the second position, being the operation position, of the head mounting plate 6. In the third less advanced position of this plate the pressure roller 12 is clear of the capstan 13. The capstan 13 is supported in the deck plate 1 and beneath this plate it is connected to a flywheel 14 which is driven by a first motor 16 A drive wheel 17 is arranged mounted on the deck plate 1 in the space between the turntables 4 and 5 and is fixed on a spindle 18. Underneath the deck plate 1 the spindle 18 carries a worm wheel 19 which meshes with a worm 21 which is driven by a second motor 22. The motors 16 and 22 are electrically connected to a microprocessor circuit 23, by means of which circuit the two motors can be switched on and off and the direction of rotation of the motor 22 can be reversed. Further, the microprocessor circuit 23 is electrically connected to an impulse relay 44, to be described in more detail hereinafter see Above the drive wheel 17 the spindle 18 further carries a pivotal arm 25, whose end portion which is remote from the spindle carries a stop projection in the form of a pin 26, on whose lower end portion a toothed idler wheel 27 is journalled, the wheel 27 being located in the space between the turntables 4 and 5. In a manner not shown, the pivotal arm 25 is connected to a friction spring not shown having a whose free end which presses in a radial direction against a portion of the idler wheel 27 which concentrically surrounds the lower end portion of the pin 26. The spring controls the pivotal movement of the arm 25 about the spindle 18 as a result of the friction torque exerted on the idler wheel 27 at the instant at which the direction of rotation of the motor 22 is reversed. Thus, by pivoting the pivotal arm 25 the idler wheel 27 can be coupled to the turntable 4 or the turntable 5, in order to drive the relevant turntable. In the manner described in the foregoing the direction of the pivotal movement depends on the direction of rotation of the second motor 22. Thus, where there is a magnetic tape cassette is present on the magnetic tape cassette apparatus, the magnetic tape in the cassette can be wound by the motor 22 Projection front the head mounting plate 6 on opposite sides of the stop pin 26 are two mutually parallel limbs 28 and 29 which are constructed and arranged mirror symmetrically relative to a plane perpendicular to the deck plate 1 and parallel to the arrow 7. Therefore, only the left hand limb will be described. The limb extends from the head mounting plate 1 in the direction of movement of the plate towards its advanced positions. Adjacent its free end the limb has a recess 30 with a wall 30a which is inclined relative to the direction of movement of the plate and a stop wall 30b. When the second motor 22 is started prior to a movement of the head mounting plate 6 towards the winding spindles 2 and 3, the stop projection 26 will enter the recess 30 the limb 28 or 29 depending on the direction of rotation of the motor 22 , so that when the head mounting plate 6 moves towards the winding spindles 2 and 3 the stop wall 30b will abut against the stop projection 26. Thus, by first starting the second motor 22 and subsequently shifting the head mounting plate 6 A substantially U or V shaped blade spring 32 which is mounted on a pin 31 exerts pressure on the pressure roller lever 10, an abutment 33 being arranged on the head mounting plate 6 to limit the pivotal movement of the pressure roller lever about the spindle 11 in a clockwise direction under the influence of the spring 32. One limb of the spring 32 bears against the pressure roller lever 10 and the other limb bears against a pin 34 which is guided in a slot 35 in the head mounting plate 6. The pin 34 is mounted at the free end of one arm of a two armed actuating lever 36 which is pivotable about a pivot 37 connected to the deck plate 1. At the free end of the other arm the actuating lever 36 carries a pin 38, which extends through the deck plate to a servo device 39 which is situated underneath the deck plate and which will be described in more detail hereinafter. The servo device 39 comprises a servo wheel 40 which is rotatably journalled in the deck plate 1 by means of a spindle 41. Further, the servo device 39 comprises a relay armature member 42, which is pivotable about a spindle 43 mounted on the underside of the deck plate 1. The relay armature member 42 is adapted to cooperate with an impulse relay 44, which is also secured to the underside of the deck plate 1. The servo wheel can be driven by a gear wheel 45, which is rigidly mounted on the spindle of the flywheel 14 and which can thus be driven by the first motor 16 which causes the gear wheel 45 to rotate in the direction indicated by the arrow The relay armature member 42 comprises four arms, namely a rigid arm 52, an elastically deflectable arm 53, a stop arm 54 and a reset arm 55. The reset arm 55 is loaded by a spring 56 which is connected to the deck plate 1 and which constantly tends to pivot the relay armature member 42 about the spindle 43 in the direction indicated by the arrow The impulse relay 44 comprises a permanent magnet 60 comprising two limbs around which two coils 61 are wound. Consequently, the relay 44 comprises both a permanent magnet and an electromagnet whose coils are connected to a current source, not shown, under control of the microprocessor circuit 23. The operation of the impuls relay 44 is arranged so that when the coils 61 are not connected to the current source the magnet 60 constantly attracts the soft iron element 59 as a result of its permanent magnetism. In the latching position the relay armature member 42 is therefore kept firmly in position by means of the stop 57 and the impuls relay 44. A brief energization of the coils 61, which can be achieved by means of an electrical pulse, causes the permanent magnetism of the magnet 60 to be neutralized by the electromagnet, so that the soft iron element 59 is no longer attracted. The spring 56 then causes the relay armature member 42 to pivot about the spindle 43 in the direction indicated by the arrow As is shown in Fig. 4, a brake member 62 is guided in the deck plate 1 so as to be slidable towards and away from the turntables 4 and 5, a spring 63 constantly urging the brake member 62 away from the turntables 4 and 5. The brake member 62 carries a projecting element 64 which is guided in a slot 65 in the deck plate 1. In the first rest position of the servo wheel 40 the free end of the element 64 presses against the eccentric cam 46 under the influence of the spring 63 and exerts a starting torque arrow When the end of the tape is reached or if a stop button, not shown, is actuated, the impulse relay 44 is re energized. As a result of this, the relay armature member is again moved from the latching position to the inoperative position, whilst in addition the latching projection 48 is disengaged from the stop projection 54a. In this situation the actuating lever 36 presses against the eccentric cam 46 in such a way that the pressure exerted on the actuating lever 36 by the spring 32 produces a starting torque on the cam, so that after release of the relay armature member 42 the servo wheel 40 can rotate further in the direction indicated by the arrow The head mounting plate 6 also comprises a projection 6a which cooperates with a switch 76 see Fig. 2 mounted on the deck plate 1. If the head mounting plate 6 is in the first or withdrawn position, the switch 76 is open. If the head mounting plate 6 is in the most advanced second position which is the case during playback or record the pressure roller 12 then presses against the capstan 13 , the projection 6a is pressed against one limb of the switch 76, so that the switch is closed. The switch is also closed in the intermediate third position of the head mounting plate during fast winding the pressure roller 12 is then clear of the capstan 13 . This switch is necessary, Fig. 7 shows a first example of the first and the second means in accordance with the invention. Fig. 7 shows the first means 71, which form part of the servo device, for determining whether the apparatus part, namely the head mounting plate 6, is in the second position. This means that it serves for detecting whether the pressure roller 12 and the capstan 13 are pressed against one another. Fig. 7 further shows the second means 72, which also form part of the servo device. The second means 72 have an input 73 coupled to an output 74 of the first means 71 and an output 75 coupled to the impulse relay 44 in particular, the coils 61 of this relay and serve for supplying a pulse shaped energizing signal to the impulse relay 44 at the instant at which the power supply to the servo device is cut off if the apparatus part is in the second position. The first means 71 comprise the switch 76, whose position is related to the position of the apparatus part. The second means 72 comprise a PNP transistor 77, whose base is coupled to a first point at a first potential V₁, whose emitter is coupled to a second point at a second potential V₂ The input 73 of the second means 72 is coupled to the base of an NPN transistor 85 One terminal 76a, of the switch 76 of the means 71 is coupled to V V₁ is for example 12 V, V₂ is 8 V and V₄ is 5 V. If the magnetic tape cassette apparatus is in the playback , recording , or fast wind mode, the switch 76 is closed and said voltages appear on points V₁, V₂ and V₄. Since the switch 76 is closed, the transistor 85 is cut off and the base voltage of the transistor 82 is determined by the setting of transistor 77. Since the base voltage of the transistor 77 is higher than the emitter voltage of this transistor, this transistor is cut off. The collector voltage of the transistor 77, and hence the base voltage of the transistor 82, is low 0 V , so that the transistor 82 is also turned off. At the instant it is assumed that a high signal appears on a second input 92 of the second means 72, so that consequently the voltage on the base of the transistor 88 is higher than that on its emitter. The transistor 88 is cut off, so that no energizing signal is applied to the relay 44 If the power supply is now switched off, the voltage V₁ decreases from the value V₁ 12 V to 0. In the time that V₁ decreases from V₁ to V₄ 5 V , the voltage on the base of the transistor 77 will briefly be lower than the voltage on the emitter of the transistor 77. This is achieved in that the resistor 78 and the capacitor 79 provide a delay, as a result of which the voltage on the emitter of the transistor 77 is maintained at V₂ for a specific time. As the transistor 77 is briefly turned on, the collector voltage of the transistor 77 and hence the base voltage of the transistor 82 increase, so that the transistor 82 is also briefly turned on. Consequently, the base voltage of the transistor 88 is pulled towards earth potential, so that the transistor 88 conducts briefly and the impulse relay 44 briefly receives an electric energizing signal. Thus, the servo device can move the head mounting plate to its withdrawn first position, e.g. because of the fact that the flywheel 14 had sufficient kinetic energy to rotate the servo wheel 40 over the relevant angle. If the head mounting plate is already in this first position, the switch 76 is open. The base voltage of the transistor 85 is then high , so that this transistor conducts. The base voltage of the transistor 82 is now low 0 V , so that this transistor is always cut off. The second means 72 now cannot generate an energizing signal if the power supply fails. The second input 92 is intended for controlling the magnetic tape cassette apparatus in the customary manner when the power supply is switched on, by means of a control unit 93 which forms part of the microprocessor 23. If the apparatus should be set to playback , the control unit 93 produces a signal which is briefly low 0 V on the input 92. In this case the transistor 88 is also briefly turned on, so that the coils 61 of the impulse relay 44 are briefly energized. If the apparatus should be switched off, the control unit 93 again produces a signal which is briefly low 0 V on the input 92, so that the impulse relay is re energized and the head mounting plate assumes its first withdrawn position. Thus, in the case of a cut off power supply the energizing signal is not only supplied if the apparatus is set to the playback mode but also if the apparatus is set to the fast wind or recording mode. It is to be noted that the voltages V₁ and V₂ may be equal. Alternatively, V₁ may be higher than V₂. In the second case the time between the instant at which the power supply drops and the instant at which this is detected is longer. V₄ may also be equal to V₂. However, in that case the operating voltage of the relay 44 should be lower than V₂ for a correct operation of this relay. Alternatively, V₄ may be lower than V₂. Fig. 8 shows a second example. Here the voltage V₂ is equal to V₁. This means that the base and the emitter of the transistor 77 are now connected to the same voltage The circuit operates as follows. If the magnetic tape cassette apparatus is set to for example playback , the switch 76 is closed. The base of the transistor 94 is therefore relatively low, which means that the transistor 94 is on . Thus, the collector voltage of the transistor 94 determines whether a current will flow in the transistor 94. As already stated in the description with reference to Fig. 7, the transistor 82 will conduct briefly when the power supply is cut off. The collector voltage of the transistor 82 and hence that of the transistor 94 therefore become briefly low, so that a current will flow in the transistor 94. Consequently, the base of the transistor 88 becomes low , so that the transistor 88 conducts briefly and the relay 44 is energized. The servo device returns the head mounting plate 6 to the first position. If the head mounting plate is already in the first position, the switch 76 is open. The base voltage of the transistor 94 is now high , which means that the transistor 94 is cut off. The base of the transistor 88 is therefore high , so that the transistor 88 is turned off. The effect of detection of a voltage drop by the transistor 77 is therefore inhibited by the transistor 94 and in this case such detection does not result in an energizing signal being supplied to the relay 44. Normal control of the tape deck by means of the control unit 93 proceeds The collector of the transistor 82 is also coupled to a second output 96 of the second means As a result of voltage variations in the electric power mains it may happen that the voltage V₁ for example 12 or 8 V decreases briefly and is subsequently restored to its previous value, so that the transistor 77 has detected a voltage decreases, whilst the voltage V₄, which is generally lower for example 5 V and which also serves for powering the control unit 93, has remained constant during this time interval. If the magnetic tape cassette apparatus was in the playback mode prior to said brief voltage decrease, the impulse relay 44 will receive a brief energizing signal as a result of the detection of this voltage decrease, so that the head mounting plate 6 is moved to the first position. Since the power supply for the control unit 93 has remained at the normal level, the internal status of the control unit 93 will not have changed. This is an undesirable situation because the internal status of the control unit 93 still the playback status, although the head mounting plate 6 is already in the first positon. The connection from the collector of the transistor 82 to the reset input 97 of the control unit 93 Fig. 9 shows a further extension of the circuit of Fig. 8. Fig. 9 shows only the relevant part of the circuit of Fig. 8. A zener diode 98 is arranged in the connection from the base of the transistor 77 to point V₁. This step serves two purposes. Firstly, it is now possible to use a power supply with a less effective smoothing cheaper for the voltage V₁. The smoothing action of the capacitor 79 results in a far more constant voltage on the emitter of the transistor 77. In the case of a large ripple on the voltage V₁ and hence on the base voltage of the transistor 77, the transistor would be turned on briefly with the same frequency as the ripple in the absence of the zener diode 98, which is of course undesirable. This is precluded by means of the zener diode 98 provided that it has a suitable breakdown voltage. Moreover, it is possible to determine the time interval between the instant at which the power supply voltage drops and the instant of detection by the transistor 77, which time interval depends on the value of the breakdown voltage of the zener diode 98. By increasing or reducing the breakdown voltage the time interval is also increased or reduced. As is shown in Figs. 7 and 8, the second means 72 and 72 may be integrated in the microprocessor 23. Alternatively, the second means may be integrated in a separate IC. It is to be noted that although the step in accordance with the invention, Further, it is to be noted that in general various modifications of the embodiments described herein are possible without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the Claims. For example, the servo device shown need not be used only for actuating a head mounting plate carrying a pressure roller. It is obvious that the servo device may also be employed for actuating other apparatus parts, such as for shifting gear wheels, for starting the rotation of a head e.g. in an auto reverse tape deck , and for inserting or ejecting a magnetic tape cassette.
