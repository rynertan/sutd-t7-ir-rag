# A ball valve incorporating a heat resistant stem seal.

## Abstract
A fire safe ball valve comprises a housing 12 including a cylindrical stem bore 28 having a concentric interior step 32 defined therein. A valve stem 20 is engaged with a valving ball and is positioned in the bore 28 of the housing 12 with a selected clearance 46 therebetween, the stem 20 having cylindrical shoulder 24 dimensioned for mating insertion into the concentric step 32 . A heat destructible bearing and seal ring 34 is selectively configured for location within the concentric step 32 , and a nut 28 is provided for forcefully displacing the shoulder 24 into the concentric step 32 to compressively locate the heat destructible ring 34 therein. The stem bore 28 has a second concentric interior step 42 having a selected axial depth, and a deformable heat resistant seal ring 44 is selectively configured for mating insertion into the second step 42 . The ring 44 has an axial thickness substantially larger than the axial depth of the sec ond step 42 so that when the heat destructible ring 34 is compressed into the first step 32 , a portion of said heat resistant seal ring 44 plastically deforms into the clearance 46 between the stem 20 and the housing 12 thereby func tionally locking the heat resistant seal 44 in operative posi tion.
