# PRESSURE TRANSDUCER FOR USE WITH ANY ONE OF A SERIES OF DETACHABLE PRESSURE DOMES OF SIMILAR CONSTRUCTION

## Abstract
The temperature coefficient of the combination of a transducer T and any one of a plurality of disposable plastic domes D manufactured to given specifications is reduced substantially to zero by making the temperature coefficient of the transducer T when the pressure dome D is not mounted therto equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the change in temperature coefficient that results from mounting the average dome D to the transducer T . The temperature coefficient of the transducer T is permanently adjusted by laser trimming a temperature dependent resister R
