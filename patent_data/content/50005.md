# Semiconductor memory with improved data programming time.

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory comprising a memory array 1 having a plurality of memory cells 3₁₁, 3₁₂, . . . , 3₂₁, 3₂₂, . . . , such as floating gate type MOS transistors, arranged in a matrix form with column lines 2₀, 2₁, . . . and row lines 1₀, 1₁ , and a plurality of bit outputs. The plurality of column lines are associated with each bit output. A circuit 5₀, 5₁, 5₂, . . . is provided which applies a program voltage to a plurality of column lines corresponding to each bit output in response to address signals or control signals Y1, Y2 . A plurality of memory cells corresponding to each bit output are program med simultaneously by the circuit.
