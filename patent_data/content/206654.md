# Interrupt generation in a processor.

## Abstract
An interrupt generation scheme is presented in accor dance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention. Each processor in a system using the scheme has an external interrupt register EIR an input output EIR IO_EIR and an external interrupt mask register EIM . When an I O device wants to interrupt a first processor the I O device writes a predetermined value to the first processor s IO_EIR. When the predetermined value is written into the first processor s IO_EIR, this causes a specified bit in the first processor s EIR to be set or cleared depending upon system convention and an interrupt to occur. The specified bit in the EIR indicates to the first processor either the I O device which caused the in terrupt, or a group of I O devices which includes the I O device which caused the interrupt. An I O device can cause a bit in the EIR to be set, but only a processor can clear bits set in its EIR. The EIM is used by the processor to postpone taking action on an interrupt received from an I O device. The processor takes action on an interrupt when an I O device causes a bit to be set in the EIR, and a corresponding bit in the processor s EIM is set. If the corresponding bit in the EIM is not set, then the processor delays action on the interrupt until the corresponding bit in the EIM is set.
