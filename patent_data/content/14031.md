The reactions leading to the formation of the dyes of the invention may be performed using conditions that have been fully described in the prior art for such reactions. Similarly, the dyes may be isolated by known methods and, as in the case of other dyes containing sulphonic acid groups, it is often convenient to isolate and use the dyes in the form of their water soluble salts, particularly their alkali metal or ammonium salts and especially sodium salts. It is to be understood that the invention relates to both the free acids and their salts. The dyes of the invention are suitable for applying to polvamide textile materials such as wool and silk but especially to synthetic polyamide textile materials, for example nylon 66 and nylon 6, using any of the general methods known for the application of acid dyes to such materials. The dyes provide yellowto red shades which have a high degree of fastness to wet treatments and to light and exhibit little or no phototropism. The invention is illustrated but not limited by the following Examples in which all parts and percentages are by weight.Example 1 A solution of 4.6 parts of sodium nitrite in 30 parts of water is added to a solution of 19.8 parts of 4 phenoxysulphonylaniline 4 sulphonic acid in 600 parts of water and 8 parts of 32 sodium hydroxide at 0 5 C. 30 Parts of 35 hydrochloric acid are then added and stirring is continued at 0 50C for a further 30 minutes. The excess nitrous acid is then destroyed and the diazo suspension is added to a stirred solution of 16.1 parts of 3 benzpylaminoN,N diethylaniline in 600 parts of water and 12 parts of 35 hydrochloric acid at 0 5 C. Saturated sodium acetate solution is then added to adjust the pli to 4 and stirring at 0 5 C is continued for 2 hours. 32 Sodium hydroxide solution is then added to adjust the pH to 9 and, after heating to 400C, 60 parts of sodium chloride are added. The precipitate is filtered off, washed with 2 brine solution and dried. When applied to nylon 66 from a weakly acid bath, a strong scarlet shade is obtained which exhibits good wet fastness and light fastness. The following Table gives further Examples of dyestuffs of the invention which may be obtained by diazotising the amine listed in the second column and coupling with the para coupling amine listed in the third column. The shades obtained on nylon are listed in the fourth column.EMI7.1 tb Example SEP Amine SEP SEP Coupling SEP Component SEP Shade tb SEP 2 SEP 4 phenoxysulphonyl SEP N,N diethylaniline 3 SEP Orange tb SEP aniline SEP sulphonic SEP acid tb SEP 3 SEP SEP N benzyl N ethyl SEP tb SEP aniline 3 SEP sulphonic tb SEP acid tb SEP 4 SEP 4 phenoxysulphonyl SEP diphenylamine SEP Scarlet tb SEP aniline 4 sulphonic SEP tb SEP acid tb SEP 5 SEP SEP 3 chloro N,N bis ss SEP Orange tb SEP hydroxyethylaniline tb SEP 6 SEP SEP N benzyl N ethylaniline SEP tb SEP 7 SEP SEP N benzyl N ethyl m SEP Scarlet tb SEP toluidine tb SEP 8 SEP SEP 2 methyl 5 acetylamino SEP Bluish tb SEP N, SEP N diethylaniline SEP red tb SEP 9 SEP 1 SEP 2 chloro N benzylaniline SEP Reddish tb SEP yellow tb SEP 10 SEP 2,5 dichloro 4 SEP N,N diethylaniline 3 SEP Bluish tb SEP phenoxysulphonyl SEP sulphonic SEP acid SEP red tb SEP aniline SEP tb SEP 11 SEP Ii SEP N benzyl N ethylaniline SEP Red tb SEP 3 sulphonic SEP acid tb SEP 12 SEP 2,5 dichloro 4 SEP 2 chloro N benzylaniline SEP Orange tb SEP phenoxysulphonyl tb SEP aniline 4 tb SEP sulphonic SEP acid tb SEP 13 SEP I SEP N benzyl N ethylaniline SEP Red tb SEP 14 SEP SEP 3 acetylamino N,N SEP Bluish tb SEP diethylaniline SEP red tb SEP 15 SEP 1I SEP 3 benzoylamino N,N tb SEP diethylaniline tb EMI8.1 tb Ex.
