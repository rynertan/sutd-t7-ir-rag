## Description
VIDEO DISC GAME HAVING RAPID VIDEO DISC SEARCH AND TRANSFER This invention relates generally to video games having a video monitor that is energized in response to player controls, and more particularly to a stored program controller and video disc storage system for such a video game. Video games have become well known forms of both arcade entertainment and home television entertainment.In video games, a cathode ray tube CRT , such as a video monitor for arcade usage and such as a television for home usage, is energized to produce a plurality of images. At least one of the images is player controlled. Depending upon the particular theme of the game play, the player controlled object s interacts with non player controlled objects. The non player controlled objects have been generated on the video screen in a number of ways. For example, analog circuit designs initially were employed for controlling the CRT. Later, digital circuit designs were employed to control the display on the CRT. The digital designs included computer or CPU designs employing stored program control of the object generation on the video screen. While such designs have generally been in connection with a raster type scan of the video screen, vector scanning techniques have also been employed to control image generation. One shortcoming of the known circuit designs for generating character on a video game screen has been in achieving design which allows a large number of nonplayer controlled objects to be generated on the video screen and changed, replaced and manipulated rapidly with a minimum of hardware and software expense. In particular, there is need for design which allows a large number of changing play fields and, ideally, design which allows changing background as part of the game play. The above noted and other shortcomings are overcome by the present invention by providing a video game machine having a video disc storage system with an addressable video disc containing composite video information and digital audio frequency control information, and a CPUstate machine type controller which cooperate to produce on a video monitor background and foreground images generated by the CPU state machine and additional background images generated from the video information on the video disc which interact with the foreground images. According to one aspect of the invention, the addressable video disc system provides data for generating background images on the video monitor. Composite video information is stored as video frequency information on a frame by frame format on a video disc. The disc revolves at a constant angular velocity CAV of 1800 revolutions per minute. One revolution of the disc corresponds to one frame of video, a single frame being a standard CAV video disc reference point. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, as many as 54,000 addressable frames can be included on one side of a CAV video disc. The composite video information stored in a videoframe by video frame format on the disc includes pictorial data and synchronization data. The pictorial data is used to generate background images, and the synchronization data is used to generate synchronization signals. The composite video information also includes in the form of a 24 bit biphase coded signal Manchester L which appears as white directed pulses on various lines during the vertical blanking interval. This coded signal included in each frame of composite video information identifies a frame number pre assigned to that video frame. The lines used during vertical blanking are generally lines number 16, 17, 18, 279, 280, and 281. The pulses extend generally from E1A IRE level 0 to E1A IRE level 100 , where 100 is the white level. According to another aspect of the present invention, information relating a particular frame number to object position and or nature of pictorial information contained in the particular frame having that frame number, is stored as digital audio frequency information in one of the disc s audio tracks. The audio frequency information relating to a particular video frame is asynchronous or synchronous with the frame it describes and leads that frame in time by some period generally corresponding to at least one frame. The digital data is stored in a buffer until it is needed to calculate its influence on the objects generated by the game logic system. The size of the buffer needed to store the data determines the lead time relationship between the data and the relative to display of the video frame to which it relates. Thus according to one feature of the present invention, information relative to the location of an object of interest in a particular video frame is stored in digital form as audio frequency information on one of the audio tracks of the disc. Storage of such information is necessary for foreground images generated by the CPUstate machine to interact with background images generated from the pictorial data contained on the video disc.Moreover, storage of information according to the present invention greatly reduces the quantity of information that must be stored and thus the size of the memory necessary for storage and the cost of the video game machine. According to one embodiment of the present invention, a video game machine of the type having a stored program for generating an image of changing objects on a video monitor and having player operated controls for controlling movement of at least one of the changing objects, and of the type in which the stored program defines a background grid of relatively large zones on the monitor and defines a foreground grid of relatively smaller zones on the monitor, includes means responsive to the stored program for generating foreground and background images on the monitor which correspond to the foreground grid and the background grid, a video disc storage system having an addressable video disc containing information stored in a video frame by video frame format, each frame having composite video information including pictorial data and synchronization data, and means responsive to the stored program and the pictorial data and the synchronization data for generating additional background images on the monitor in synchronization with the foreground and background images generated by theCPU state machine controller. According to another aspect of the invention, means are provided responsive to the synchronization data for generating external vertical and horizontal synchronization signals. The external horizontal synchronization signal is compared to an internal clock signal, and the clock signal altered to eliminate phase and frequency differences between it and the external horizontal synchronization signal. It is thus a general object of the present invention to provide a new and improved video game having access to tens of thousands of frames of video data which can be used in an interactive manner with player controlled foreground objects. The above and other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from reading the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment of the invention in connection with the appended drawings. FIG. 1 is perspective view of a video game machine including its housing FIG. 2 is a functional block diagram of the video disc and controller logic for the video game of FIG. 1 FIG. 3A is a functional block diagram of the audio track decoder, and FIG. 3B is a functional block diagram of the frame number decoder employed in the diagram ofFIG. 2 FIG. 4 is a functional block diagram of the serial interface employed in the diagram of FIG. 2 FIG. 5 is a functional block diagram of the controller logic for the video game of FIG. 1 FIG. 6 is a functional block diagram of the foreground generator employed in the diagram of FIG. 5 and FIG. 7A is a functional block diagram of the background generator, and FIG. 7B is a functional block diagram of the video summer employed in the diagram ofFIG. 5. Referring now to the drawings, and in particular toFIG. 1, there is shown in perspective view a video game machine 10 according to the present invention. The video game machine 10 includes a cabinet 12 and a video monitor 14 supported by the cabinet 12. Several player operator controls 16 are provided in the form of a track ball 18 and a set of push buttons switches 20. A coin mechanism 22 is supported on the cabinet 12 for receiving coins to enable game play. In response to operation of the coin mechanism 22, an image forming beam illuminates the video monitor 14 to form a plurality of moving images. At least one of the moving images is under the control of the player via the controls 16. The video monitor 14 is preferably a raster type scan cathode ray tube CRT . Preferably, the CRT is a color kinescope having three guns in which the control grids or the cathodes can be driven with appropriate red, green and blue signals. If desired, the CRT may be a monochromatic kinescope. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, any of a number of game themes can be employed using the present invention. Accordingly, a particular game theme will not be described as it is believed that the invention is readily understood in terms of the hardware to be described. Referring now to FIG. 2, the video game machine 10 includes a controller 30 for controlling the image defining beam which energizes the Video monitor 14. For sake of simplicity, reference will be made to a single image defining beam even though there are three such beams in a three gun color CRT and a single beam in a monochromatic CRT. The controller 30 shown in phantom lines in FIG. 2 includes a computer system 32 and a computer graphics generator or state machine 34 best illustrated in FIG. 5.Also included is a video disc interface 300 illustrated in phantom lines in FIG. 2 , having an audio track decoder 400 illustrated in greater detail in FIG. 3A , a video frame number decoder 450 illustrated in greater detail inFIG. 3B , and a serial interface 500 illustrated in greater detail in FIG. 4 . With continued reference toFIG. 2, the controller 30 further includes assorted processing circuitry 550 illustrated in part in greater detail in FIGS. 5, 6, 7A and 7B. The computer graphics generator or state machine 34 and certain parts of the controller 30 excluding the video disc interface 300 are disclosed by Jun Yum in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 438,247, filed onNovember 1, 1982, entitled Video Game Controller andMethod and assigned to the assignee of the present application. The Yum application is incorporated herein by reference. With continued reference to FIG. 2, a video disc game according to the present invention includes a video disc 302 which is designed to operate at a constant angular velocity CAV on a conventional video disc player not illustrated , such as a Pioneer VP 1000 Laserdisc player or a Pioneer PR 8210 Videodisc player. The CAV disc 302 revolves continuously at 1800 revolutions per minute, one revolution per frame of video information. Thus each frame of video on the CAV disc 302 is addressable, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. A frame is two complete scans of a video screen at 1 30 second, and is composed of two fields and a retrace. There can be as many as 54,000 addressable frames on one side of a CAV video disc. In operation, a laser beam reads data encoded on the optical video disc 302. In the case of a reflective disc, the laser beam is reflected off the shiny surface of the disc. In the case of a transmissive disc, the laser beam passes through the transparent surface of the disc. The video disc 302 has encoded at video frequency rates composite video information including pictorial data, synchronization data, and pulse data. The pulse data is in the form of a 24 bit biphase coded signal Manchester L appearing as white directed pulses on various lines during the vertcal blanking interval, and identifies a unique frame number pre assigned to each video frame. During operation, the laser beam reads the data encoded on the video disc and generates on a line 304 a composite video signal. Other frame number formats may be used. The video disc 302 further includes two completely discreet audio channels encoded in frequency modulation at audio frequency rates. In conventional video disc operation, the two audio channels are used to include stereo or bilingual commentary. In the present invention, however, conventional audio information is stored only in one of the audio channels digital data correlatng object position and or nature of the pictorial data in a particular frame to the frame number for that particular frame is stored in the other audio channel. A line 306 couples the audio information on an audio channel 1 of the disc 302 to an audio amplifier 308 which, under the control of a sound board 310 produces sound, for example sound effects, at a speaker 312. A line 314 couples the digital data encoded at audio frequency rates on an audio channel 2 of the disc 302 to the audio decoder 400 of the video disc interface 300. The line 304 couples the composite video signal to a sync separator 316 and to a color decoder 318. Using standard television circuitry, the color decoder 318 decodes the chrominance and luminance information from the composite video signal and produces red R , green G and blue B signals on a line 320. The RGB output of the decoder 318 is coupled to a multiplexor 322. The multiplexor 322 multiplexes the RGB signals it receives on the line 320 from the color decoder with RGB signals it receives on a line 93 from the computer graphics generator 34, and produces RGB signals that are coupled to the monitor 14 via a line 324. The multiplexing operation is controlled by a signal coupled to the multiplexor 322 from the generator 34 via a line 604. With continued reference to the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 2, the composite video signal from the video disc 302 is asynchronous with the rest of the system, and in particular with the video produced by the computer graphics generator 34. The composite video on the line 304 is received by the sync separator 316 which separates from the composite video signal the horizontal and vertical synchronization signals that were encoded on the video disc 302. The sync separator 316 is of common design. It produces an external vertical sync pulse, termed EXTVSYNC, which is coupled via a line 326 to a clock 64 of the foreground generator illustrated in FIG. 6. The sync separator 316 also produces an external horizontal sync signal, termed EXT BSNC, which is coupled via a line 328 to a phase comparator 330 of a phasedlocked loop PLL circuit 332. The PLL circuit 332 further includes a low pass filter 334 and a voltage controlled oscillator VCO 336. The phase comparator 330 receives in addition to theEXT HSYNC signal encoded on the video disc 302, a horizontal synchronization signal via the line 94 which is related to the system clock of the computer system 32.The comparator 330 compares both signals for frequency and phase differences and produces a difference signal on the line 338. The difference signal is filtered by the low pass filter 334 and coupled via a line 340 to the voltage controlled oscillator 336. In response to its input, theVCO 336 generates a signal termed EXT CLK which is coupled via a line 342 to a clock 42 of the computer system 32 illustrated in FIG. 5, where it is used to alter the system clock. In operation, if the signal received by the phase comparator 330 via the line 94 is slower than that received via the line 328, the difference signal fed to the VCO 336 via the line 340 forces the VCO 336 to speed up, and vice versa. This eventually results in a phase lock between the signals received by the phase comparator 330 via the lines 94 and 328 Thus, the EXT CLK signal is adjusted such that the horizontal synchronization signal from the computer system 32 received by the phase comparator 330 via the line 94 is in synchronism with the horizontal synchronization signal received from the video disc via the line 328. So synchronized, the two video sources the computer graphics generator 34 and the video disc 302 can have their respective pictorial data multiplexed by the multiplexor 322 for apparent simultaneous display on the monitor 14. With continued reference to FIG. 2, the video frame number decoder 450 receives composite video from the video disc 302 via the line 304. For each time, the decoder 450 decodes the pre assigned frame number from pulses encoded during the vertical blanking interval. The coded data is in the form of a 24 bit Manchester L code appearing as white directed pulses on various lines during the vertical blanking interval. The lines used are, in general, line numbers 16, 17, 18, 279, 280, and 281. The white directed pulses extend from E1A IRE level 0 plus 5 , minus 0 to E1A IRE level 100 plus 0 , minus 5 , where 100 is the white level. The 24 bit Manchester code is decoded by the video frame number decoder 450 and stored in latches so that the computer system 32 can thereafter read the frame number. Referring to FIG. 3B, the video frame number decoder 450 includes a frame number stripper 452 that receives the composite video signal via the line 304. The stripper 452 also receives the horizontal and vertical sync information contained on the disc 302, the EXT HSYNC signal and theEXT VSYNC signal, via the lines 328 and 326, respectively.The output of the stripper 452 is fed to a data detector 454 which detects data signals, and to a clock detector 456 which detects clock signals. The output of the clock detector 456 is coupled to both the data detector 454 and to a serial to parallel converter 458. The data output of the detector 454 is also fed to the converter 458, which in turn outputs the decoder data encoded during the vertical blanking interval onto the microprocessor data bus. The data encoded during the vertical blanking interval, however, relates only to the frame number assigned to the frame and not to the position and or nature of objects in the frame. Data supplied to correlate object position and or data to frame number is recorded on one of the audio tracks of the disc 302. The audio track data in the illustrated embodiment is essentially asynchronous with the video frame it describes. Generally, it leads the video frame it describes by a time period corresponding to at least one frame. In an illustrated embodiment, the audio track data is typically 60 frames ahead of the frame it describes.The size of the data buffer to be used,determines the length of the lead time, that is, the time before the frame to which the data relates. With reference again to FIG. 2, the audio track decoder 400 receives the digital data from the audio channel via the line 314. It receives a frequency modulated audio frequency signal, decodes the signal to extract digital data, and stores the data in a buffer until the computer system 32 is ready to read it. In the illustrated embodiment, data is stored in 1k blocks in random access memory until it is read. Referring now to FIG. 3A, the audio track decoder 400 includes an edge comparator 402 which receives digital data from the audio channel 2 via the line 314 at a transmission rate of approximately 5000 bits per second.The edge comparator 402 is a zero crossing detector which detects all transitions through ground. One output of the edge comparator 402 is coupled to a data detector 404. The detector 404 determines whether an edge is detected between clock pulses from the output of the edge comparator 402 during a 150 microsecond time period, the clock time period for a 5000 bit per second transmission rate being 200 microseconds. A detected edge indicates that a 1 was received by the edge comparator 402, and when that occurs the data detector 404 generates a high voltage to be clocked into a serial to parallel converter 406 via the clock from a clock detector 408. RAM 412 is used to store the data from the serial to parallel converter 406, and counters 416 are employed to address the RAM 412 sequentially. A multiplexor 418 is coupled to the counters 416 and to the serial to parallel converter 406, a start and end buffer detector 420, and a pulse shaping circuit 422. The start and end buffer detector 420 is used to indicate when the transmission ends so that data stored in the RAM 412 can be read. Referring once again to FIG. 2, the video disc interface 300 further includes a serial interface 500.The interface 500 generates and transmits to the video disc player a coded signal which controls the functions performed on the video disc 302, for example, play, reverse, three times speed, search to frame, and so forth.The coded signal consists of a series of bursts of a carrier frequency, with the bursts separated by a specified duration of time that determines whether a 0 or a 1 is being transmitted. For a Pioneer VP 1000 Laserdisc player, 25 control codes can be encoded using a serial 10 bit pulse code modulation PCM scheme. .Each pulse burst consists of 10 pulses at 38 kHz and is approximately 0.263 milliseconds long. A 10 bit transmission starts and ends with a burst and therefore contains 11 bursts. The elapse time between bursts, termed the bit period, is either 1.05 milliseconds to indicate a logic 0 or 2.10 milliseconds to indicate a logic 1 . The serial interface 500 also generates the protocol necessary for the controller 30 to communicate with the video disc 302 via its video disc player. Referring now to FIG. 4, the serial interface 500 includes a parallel to serial encoder chip 502 and a 38 kEz clock 504. A burst counter 512 counts ten bits or pulses at 38 kHz for each pulse burst, and a period counter 510 determines whether the bit period between successive pulse bursts is 1.05 or 2.10 milliseconds. A bit counter 506 counts the 10 bit transmission which begins and ends with a pulse burst A transmission gate 508 disables the counter 506 after the 10 bit transmission is completed and generates a ready flag. A burst gate 514 gates the 10 cycles of 38 kHz to the video disc player via a line 518 after amplification by a tristate amplifier 516. Referring once again to FIG. 2, the video game machine 10 includes the controller 30 having the computer system 32 and the state machine or computer graphics generator 34. The computer system 32 includes a stored program which provides input to the state machine 34.Once the state machine has the necessary input, it cycles through its various states to provide the multiplexor 322 with RGB signals via the line 93 without further control of the CPU described below until updated input is needed. Referring now to FIG. 5, the computer system 32 includes a central processing unit CPU 40 such as anIntel 8088 microprocessor and associated clock circuitry 42, an address bus 44, and a data bus 46. The clock circuitry 42 is coupled via the line 342 to the VCO 336 illustrated in FIG. 2 or to a crystal clock selected by the microprocessor 40. The EXT CLK signal received by the clock 42 via the line 342 alters the system clock as previously described. With continued reference to FIG. 5, the computer system 32 also includes program memory 48, such as random access memory RAM 48A and read only memory ROM 48B. A general purpose input output circuit GPIO 50 is also included. The program memory 48 and the general purpose input output circuit 50 are coupled to the CPU 40 via the address bus 44 and the data bus 46 in a routine manner. The general purpose input output circuitry 50 is responsive to the switches 20 and to the coin mechanism 22, and to the track ball 18 for inputting data to the CPU 40. The GPIO circuit 50 outputs signals for generating music, cabinet lighting effects, and so forth. Additionally, the GPIO circuit 50 outputs on a line 518 a video disc status signal which essentially indicates whether composite video is being read from the disc 302.To determine this, the vertical sync signal from the video disc, EXT VSYNC, is monitored. If the EXT VSYNC signal is present, composite videois being received from the video disc 302 if this signal is not present, the video disc player is either searching or is not active. Although not shown in the drawings, a watchdog timer is provided to reset the processor 40 unless it receives a pulse through the GPIO 50 at least every 256 milliseconds. The state machine 34 includes a foreground generator 60 and a background generator 62. The foreground generator 60 generates a foreground video signal FVS corresponding to an image frame for the monitor 14 divided into a foreground grid of zones relatively few in number and large in size. The background generator 62 generates a background video signal BVS corresponding to an image frame for the monitor 14 divided into a background grid of zones relatively large in number and small in size. The background grid is non overlapping, while the foreground grid can overlap. As will be apparent, the background generator 62 is especially adapted for generating the relatively large, slower moving objects hence the term background.Conversely, the foreground generator 60 is especially adapted for generating the objects which are to smoothly change position. Specifically, foreground objects can be positioned at any pixel location while background objects cannot. Background objects can only be generated at defined boundaties 8 pixels apart. Thus, the foreground generator is object oriented and the background generator is character oriented. However, if multiple background objects are used, then background can be made equivalent to foreground. The foreground generator 60 and the background generator 62 are each responsive to a clock circuitry 64.The clock 64 receives via a line 602 a 5 MHz signal, termed HCLK, froma crystal oscillator or the EXT CLK signal from the VCO 336, and the INT VSYNC signal or theEXT VSYNC signal from the sync separator 316 via the line 326, respectively, as illustrated in greater detail inFIG. 6. Referring now to FIG. 7, and in particular to FIG.7B, the state machine 34 also includes a foreground background dominance arbitor 80. In implementation, the arbitor 80 is a video summer it selectively combines theFVS signal and the BVS signal from the generators 60, 62 to generate a combined video signal CVS. The arbitor 80 is responsive to a priority signal on a line 82 from the computer system 32. The arbitor 80 combines the FVS and the BVS signals in a priority determined by the value of the priority signl on the line 82. Specifically, upon the occurrence of non zero data in both the FVS signal and the BVS signal, the priority signal determines which of the BVS and FVS signals is to be transmitted. In the absence of data in both the FVS and the BVS signals, a transparent color as disclosed in the above referenced Yum patent application or a video disc image is chosen by the arbitor 80. A foreground background decoder 250 of the arbitor 80 produces a control signal SELECT I on a line 254 for selection between the FVS and the BVS signals. The decoder 250 further produces a signal SELECT II on a line 604 which is coupled to the multiplexor 322. The SELECTII signal controls the multiplexor 322 and controls whether the monitor 14 receives the RGB signals from the computer graphics generator 34, or the RGB signals from the color decoder 318. The remaining circuitry of FIGS. 5, 6 and 7 operates essentially as disclosed in the above referenced yum patent application. During game play, the background video information from the video disc 302 is displayed on the monitor 14 as is the video generated by the computer graphics generator 34. The video from both sources the disc 302 and the generator 34 are not correlated to each other in the sense that one knows the content of the other. If during game play, the player were to fire a missile from the foreground to a target in the background, for example from the cockpit of an airplane located in the foreground to a target ship located in the background, the location of the airplane, the missile and the ship must be determined for the proper display of each video frame.The digital data stored on the audio channel 2 is the information needed by the computer system 32 to establish a reference system for determining where the ship is in each video frame. The inforamtion stored on audio channel 2 relates to both size and location of the object in the video frame. After the missile is launched, the computer system 32 will check to determine if there is coincidence between the target in the background video from the disc 302 and the computer generated graphic missile from the generator 34. If there is coincidence, then a collision has occurred which means the missile hit its target. Then depending on the programming, an explosion may be generated to cover the ship to show the target was hit and destroyed. Additionally, during every video frame the computer system must know where the target ship is located to give the impression to the player that the airplane is flying past the target and the previously launched missile. To create the digital data for encoding on the audio channel 2, a single video frame is displayed on a screen and a cursor is moved around to locate objects in the pictorial information which are to be encoded. Typical encoded data includes the location of the object in an x,y Cartesian coordinate system and the size of the object.Using this size and position information, an algorithm calculates how far into the screen, that is, how far from the foreground, the object is located in the background.This distance information is also stored in the audio channel 2, as may be data indicating the location of the horizon and any other relevant information, such as the frame number being encoded. This encoding process is repeated for each video frame. All information considered meaningful to the computer system 32 is encoded for each video frame and stored in the audio channel 2 of the video disc 302. The encoded data is stored on the audio channel 2 in real time while the video disc 302 is being mastered or while the information on the disc 302 is being edited. During game play, the video frame decoder 450 reads the frame number of the video frame addressed on the video disc 302 so that the computer system 32 knows exactly what frame is being displayed. Knowing the frame number, the computer sytem 32 accesses the frame data buffer containing the data describing object position and or nature for that particular frame number, which was read from the audio channel 2 and stored in the frame data buffer prior to the video frame actually being addressed. Thus the present system in which digital information relating to object position and or nature is stored on the audio channel 2 of the video disc 302 permits the computer system 32 to know exactly where an object is located on the screen without having to save a large data base in the computer system, for example, an array having dimensions equal to the maximum number of picture elements that can be displayed on the monitor 14 in both the vertical and horizontal directions. The present system, therefore, greatly reduces the required storage capacity, and thus the time needed to effectively access and use the stored information. Hardware costs are also greatly reduced. As previously indicated, any of a number of game themes can be employed using the invention hereof. In one embodiment of the present invention, the game play program is also encoded on the audio channel 2 of the video disc 302. In this embodiment, the game play program is loaded into the RAM 48A and used by the computer system 32 to control game play. Game graphics character may also be so encoded. The information stored on the audio channel 2 of the disc 302 has been described as frequency modulated information. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that other types of modulation are possible It is essential, however, that the digital information be stored on an audio channel track of the disc 302 and not in the composite video. The digital data can then be processed and stored prior to it being needed for the video frame it describes. It can then be asynchronous with the video frame it describes, thereby eliminating synchronization problems during both the encoding phase when the information is encoded onto the disc 302, and during the decoding phase and during subsequent utilization of the information. Although rather specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein, it is to be understood that they have been by way of example. Numerous changes and modifications to the preferred embodiment described herein will be obvious to those of ordinary skill without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed.
