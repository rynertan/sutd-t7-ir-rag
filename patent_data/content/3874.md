# LAMINATED WEB AND PROCESS OF MANUFACTURING

## Abstract
The gas and light barrier properties of a web of thermoplastic bags designed for aseptic packaging are improved by laminating a material of high gas and light imperviousness, such as metal foil, to the thermoplastic bag material during a blown film extrusion process. In one embodiment a pair of foil laminates 26 are applied to opposite sides of an inflated tube 16 by rollers 22 which flatten the tube to provide flat surfaces 24 for the laminates being applied to the tube. The resulting laminated web has a pair of aligned, uncovered longitudinal portions 32 along the centre of which a slit seal may be made to provide a pair of laminated webs each having an uncovered longitudinal edge. In another embodiment a single sheet of foil having a width less than the full circumference of the tube may be employed to provide a single web having a longitudinal uncovered section.
