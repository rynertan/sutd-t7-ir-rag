## Description
COLD WATER SOLUBLE GELATINBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to cold water soluble gelatin and, particularly, to an improved cold water soluble gelatin product and a process for preparing it Gelatin is a widely used food ingredient It has the ability to thicken or otherwise improve the texture of a variety of liquid products and also to set to a heat reversible gel which is useful in preparing products such as gelatin desserts. In products such as salad dressings, it aids in suspending particulate ingredients, and in frozen products such as ice cream it has the ability to retard the growth of ice crystals, The art has long recognized a need for cold water soluble gelatin products, Unfortunately, it has been difficult until this time to achieve a combination of good solubility and other desired properties for gelatin in cold water.One area in particular where cold water solubility would be desirable is for the preparation of gelatin dessert mixes.There is a growing demand for all categories of food products which can be fully prepared and ready for consumption in the shortest period of time. The vast majority of gelatin dessert mixes which are currently available require the use of hot or boiling water to dissolve the gelatin and extended times, on the order of from about 2 to 4 hours, to permit them to achieve the proper consistency for eating. Thus, these products are often viewed as inconvenient because they require the use of hot or boiling water and also because of the extended setting time before they can be enjoyed.Because of this, many consumers who enjoy eating gelatin desserts and salads prepared with them, forego their use because they perceive them as too inconvenient This problem was recognized by Hagerty in US Patent 2,803,548 wherein he disclosed that a room temperature soluble gelatin could be prepared by drying a gelatin solution at reduced pressure wahin a relatively narrow temperature range of between 37 and 70 C. According to his procedure, an aqueous gelatin solution, preferably containing a sugar such as sucrose, was first prepared by heating and was then dried at the indicated temperatures at pressures of from 50 to 100 millimeters of mercury.The disclosure emphasizes the need to dry at the indicated tempera tures and pressures, and states that where dextrose or corn syrup are substituted for the sucrose, a dense, rather than fluffy, product is produced, While the patent suggests that the material is soluble in cold water, no specific details as to water tem erature or time for solution are given, The patent does not indicate the range of other properties desired for a good product however, it does states that gel strength of products prepared according to the disclosure are about 10 less than those prepared by conventional techniques. In US Patent 2,948,622 Cahn discloses that a hot solution comprising about one part gelatin, nine parts sugar and 10 parts water can be dried as a thin film, and that the dry product is soluble in cold tap water, Contrary to the disclosure of Hagerty, Cahn indicates that the temperature should be between 70 and 120 C and the pressure should be near atmospheric He indicates, however, that pressures down to about 0.75 atmospheres can also be employed, While the exact conditions of dissolution of the final product in cold water are not given, It is indicated that the product of at least one example can be dissolved in cold water and then fully set by cooling for about 45 minutes at a temperature of 10 C. In addition to the batch drying process of Hagerty and the atmospheric drum drying process of Cahn, these two workers together disclosed in US Patent 2,841,498 that a cold water soluble gelatin could be prepared by spray drying an aqueous solution of sucrose and gelatin, provided that the sucrose content was at least 8 times, and preferably on the order of 9 or 10 times, the gelatin content This disclosure is very specific as to the need for the sugar to be sucrose and that the sucrose be present in a specific concentration.While other sugars such as dextrose and com syrup solids are disclosed, they are mentioned only for admixture with the spray dried product Cahn and Hagerty disclose that after dissolving their product in cold water, it sets to a gel within between about 7 to 15 minutes when cooled to about 32OF, and a solution at 75 F when placed in an ordinary kitchen refrigerator sets to a firm gel therein in about one and one half hours. It is disclosed that the acid component can be inciuded prior to drying if desired. In Canadian Patent 896,965 to de Boer and US Patent 3,904,771 to Donnelly et al, there are described procedures for preparing various cold water soluble gelatin products by spray drying solutions comprising gelatin and an acid. Donnelly et al disclose that in addition to the acid which is employed at a level of from about 30 to 200 by weight of gelatin, the solution can contain a sugar such as fructose or sucrose prior to spray drying. In the Canadian patent however, de Boer indicates that sugar can be eliminated from the spray drying solution where the acid is employed at a level of from about 5 to about 20 based upon the weight of the gelatin. According to de Boer, spray drying the dilutely acid gelatin solution permits the formation of fine droplets for enhanced drying. According to the disclosure of Kalafatas in US Patent 3,972,221, the need for elaborate or extensive drying systems of the type described in US Patents 2,803,548, 2,841,498 and 2,948,622 can be obviated by the use of an extrusion process. According to this disclosure, the cold water soluble gelatin composition is prepared by subjecting a sugarigelabn admixture to heat and pressure while applying shearing forces to the admixture in an extruder. The products are said to dissolve in water at about 50 F after 2 minutes of spoon stirring, The solutions prepared in this manner are set after about two hours refrigeration, as compared to about four hours when hot water is used to dissolve conventional gelatin dessert mixes. The disclosure incidentally mentions the use of dispersants, wetting agents and emulsifiers to enhance dispersibility. Similarly, US patent 2,819,970 to Steigmann and US Patent 2,819,971 toGunthardt also mention the use of additives of this type. Recently issued US Patents 4,401,685, 4,407,836, and 4,409,255 describe processes for the preparation of cold water soluble gelatins which possess improved properties as compared with those previously known in the artThese patents all call for the use of a particular sugar composition, namely a mixture of corn syrup solids and maltodextrin, in combination with gelatin in a range of ratio of sugar to gelatin by weight of 2T to 12 1 preferably 3 7 1.An aqueous solution is prepared containing the gelatin, sugar, an acid and a surfactant and the solution is dried. In the 685 patent, the drying is effected by spreading a thin layer of the solution on a surface heated with steam at 1060 psig pressure. In the 836 patent the solution is extruded as a foam and then dried. It has now been found that cold water soluble gelatins having even more enhanced properties can be obtained by modification of the processes described in the latter three patents set forth above.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Various aspects of the invention are set forth in the claims. The invention provides a process for preparing a cold water soluble gelatin product, the product of that process, and a gelatin dessert mix which is fully soluble in cold water. As hereinafter described in detail with reference to the preferred embodiments, the present invention provides a a gelatin product which is completely dispersed and dissolved in cold water. b a cold water soluble gelatin product which, after dissolution in cold water, forms a gel of good strength and high quality in a conveniently short period of time. c a gelatin dessert mix which can be fully dissolved in tap water with vigorous spoon stirring and then set to a high quality dessert in a conveniently short period of refrigeration. d an improved process for preparing a cold water soluble gelatin product. e a process for preparing a cold water soluble gelatin product which is completely dissolved in cold tap water and is then fully set to form a high quality gel within a conveniently short period of refrigeration. One process according to the invention comprises preparing an aqueous solution comprising water, gelatin, sugar consisting essentialiy of a hydrolyzed corn starch having a dextrose equivalent DE in the range of 20 to 36 also referred to hereafter as corn syrup and or a maltodextrin having a DE in the range of 5 20, and an acid, and an amount of surface active agent effective to increase dispersibility in the final product, and drying the solution so prepared. Another improvement or modification comprises subjecting the aqueous solution comprising sugar, gelatin, and other optional components, prepared as described to a heat treatment prior to carrying out the drying step described in said patents. The heat treatment step comprises maintaining said solution at at least one temperature in the range of about 1100F to about 180 F for a holding period of about 1 hour to about 24 hours, an acid being incorporated into said solution either before or after said holding period and prior to the drying step. After drying, the material is preferably comminuted and screened to a particle size from about 20 to about 200 US mesh wherein at least about 40 percent by weight of the particles will pass through US mesh greater than 100. The product of this process is useful in all applications where cold water solubility would be advantageous, and it is particularly useful in the preparation of gelatin dessert mixes which are fully soluble in cold water. The dessert mixes according to the present invention include acid, buffer, flavor and color, in addition to the cold water soluble gelatin prepared according to the process of the invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The cold water soluble gelatin product prepared according to the present invention finds particular utility in gelatin dessert mixes, and will therefore be described in this environment as exemplary. This is not meant to imply, however, that other applications of the product are not intended. In fact, the products of the invention will be very useful in the preparation of saiad dressings, ice cream, cake and pie mixes which require no baking, candies, and a wide variety of food products which currently employ gelatin or gelatin like materials. As a matter of definition, the term cold water soluble as used in the present application means that the product can be dissolved in tap water at the indicated concentration of usage in less than about 5 minutes, and preferably less than 1 minute, by stirring with a spoon to provide vigorous agitation. The temperature of tap water as delivered at the faucet can vary over a wide range, generally from about 50F to about 700F although temperatures above and below this range can be encountered. The temperature of the tap water in any given instance can influence the rate at which a particular product of the invention will dissolve.Similariy, variation in mineral content of the tap water may also affect the rate at which the product dissolved. The term amorphous gelatin as used herein means gelatin products which pass directly from the liquid solution to the dry state without forming a gelled state. Typically, amorphous gelatin products form clumps when mixed with cold water however, these problems are alleviated according to the invention. Also by way of definition, all parts and percentages used throughout this disclosure are on a weight to weight basis, unless the contrary is indicated at the point of usage. While the most important ingredient according to the present invention is gelatin, the particular type of gelatin employed is selected primarily based upon the intended use of the ultimate product and not for any particular functionality of the gelatin within the process of the invention.Therefore, the cold water soluble gelatin products of this invention can be prepared from gelatins of either the TypeA acid or Type B alkali forms. Similariy, the gelatin can be prepared from any collagen source including bone, hide and other collagen sources, and can be derived from any suitable animal, including beef and port sources. The bloom will typically be within the range of from about 150 to 275. According to the process, an aqueous solution comprising gelatin and hydrolyzed corn starch and or maltodextrin is applied in a thin layer to a drying surface and is then dried under reduced pressure to provide a product which is preferably flaky and of low density. While any apparatus capable of performing the drying operation can be employed, vacuum drum dryers are capable of handling high volumes of material at practical solids concentrations to achieve rapid drying at low applied pressure. To prepare the solution comprising gelatin and hydrolyzed corn starch and or maltodextrin for drying, the desired components are heated in the desired concentration in water, preferably to a temperature of about 150 to 180 F, to achieve complete solution. Typically, this is conducted by dissolving the gelatin in hot water first and then adding a liquid com syrup to the gelatin solution. Advantageously, a gelatin solution from a gelatin production process, typically containing about 15 to 20 gelatin can be mixed with com syrup to achieve the desired concentration. The gelatin concentration is typically within the range of from about 5 to about 25 and the corn syrup solids concentration is typically within the range of from about 20 to about 80 , based on the weight of the total solution.The ratio of sugar, as defined above, to gelatin is critical from a processing standpoint Advantageously, the ratio is within the range of from greater than 2 1 up to about 12 1, and preferably is within the range of from about 3 1 to about 7 1. The total solids concentration of the solution for drying, including the com syrup solids, gelatin and any other solid materials, is advantageously within the range of from about 30 to about 70 A particularly useful concentration of total solids is of the order of 60 . One of the principal differences between the processes described in the prior art and the preferred process of the invention is the utilization, as the preferred sugar component of the aqueous composition which is to be dried, of a hydrolyzed com starch having a DE of about 20 to about 36 and being substantially free, i.e., containing less than 10 of related starch hydrolysis products particularly maltodextrin. in the aforesaid US Patents 4,401,685,4,407,836 and 4,409,255, the sugar component comprised a mixture of which the chief components are maltodextrin DE 1 23 and corn syrup solids DE 23 42 .It has now been found that the use of the preferred hydrolyzed starches alone, in the absence of maltodextrin, gives rise to a significant improvement in the properties of the cold water soluble gelatin produced as the end product of the process. Surprisingly, good results were also obtained when using maltodextrin alone without the hydrolyzed starches of higherDE. The nature of these improved properties will be discussed in detail hereinafter. A particularly preferred sugar component for use in the preparation of cold water soluble gelatins in accordance with this invention is a hydrolyzed corn starch having a DE of about 24 to about 30 and a most preferred sugar component is a hydrolyzed com starch having a DE of about 26. In addition to the gelatin and the sugar, the aqueous solution for drying must also comprise an acid suitable for food use such as fumaric, citric, malic, adipic, ascorbic, tartaric, succinic, and phosphoric acids. Among these, fumaric, citric and adipic acids are preferred. The acid.when employed, is found to improve final product solubility and advantageously is present in a ratio of acid to gelatin within the range from about 0.05 0.5 1. More preferred ratios of acid to gelatin are within the range of from about 0.10 0.23 1, which range significantly improves product solubility and can provide all the acid that is required for a good tasting gelatin dessert It may sometimes also be desirable to employ a suitable buffer such as a sodium or potassium salt of any of the above mentioned acids. The pH of the dessert may be adjusted to within the range of from about 3 to about 4.5 by use of the buffering salts. In carrying out the process of the invention, the acid can be incorporated directly into the aqueous solution at the same time as the gelatin and sugar are introduced therein in the manner described above. However, as explained more fully below, the acid can be introduced at later stages of the process of the invention provided that the acid is always introduced at a stage preceding the drying step. According to a prefened embodiment of the invention, the solution prior to drying also contains a surface active agent such as those known generically to the art as polysorbates, hydroxylated lecithin, acetylated mono glycerides, succinylated monoglycerides, ethoxylated mono and digiycerides, sodium stearoyl 2 lactylate, and the like. These surface active agents will be employed in amounts effective to render the dried product more easily dispersible in cold water. Exemplary of the polysorbate surface active agents are polysorbate 60, polysorbate 65 and polysorbate 80. Poty sorbate 60 is identified chemically as polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan monostearate, while polysorbate 65 is known as polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan tristearate, and polysorbate 80 is known as polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan monooleate. In addition to these materials, other surface active agents which have the ability of increasing the dispersibiiity of the final product in cold water can also be employed.While the exact level of addition will be controlled based upon a balance between cost, effectiveness and taste, it is preferred to maintain the level within the range of from about 0.05 to about 7 based upon the weight of the gelatin to provide the desired degree of improvement in dispersibility without adversely affecting the ultimate rate of set or gel strength of the cold water soluble gelatin product produced according to the process of the invention. In accordance with an optional, but preferred, embodiment of the invention the aqueous solution comprising corn syrup solids, gelatin and other components discussed above is subjected to a heat treatment pnor to drying. In this embodiment the said aqueous solution, which has usually been brought to a temperature of the order of 150 to 1 80 F in order to obtain a clear solution, is maintained at at least one temperature in the range of about 1 10 F to about 180 F for a holding period of time not less than about I hour and preferably, not more than about 48 hours. The precise temperature and time to be employed in any given instance will vary depending upon the particular combination of gelatin and com syrup employed.The most advantageous temperature and time to be employed in any given instance can be readily determined by a process of trial and tenor A number of alternative ways of canying out this heat treatment using any conventional heating equipment can be employed. Thus, in one altemative, the holding period is carried out at a temperature in the higher end of said temperature range, and preferably at a temperature of about 1600F, for a holding period within the above stated range, preferably a holding period of up to about 4 hours. When the holding period is complete, the solution is then cooled, or allowed to cool, to a temperature of about 115go prior to being submitted to the drying step.In another alternative form of heat treatment the solution, after having been formed initially at a temperature of about 150 F to about 160 F, is then cooled or allowed to cool to a temperature in the range of about 115 F to 130 F and maintained thereat for a holding period within the above stated range of about 1 to 48 hours. In this particular alternative form of heating step, the holding period is longer than is normally required in the previous altemative method and is generally in the order of up to about 24 hours. In a further alternative the aqueous solution can be submitted to two separate holding periods one of which is at a temperature in the higher end of the above range and the other of which is at a temperature in the lower end of said range. Irrespective of which of the above alternative is employed the acid which, as discussed above, is required to be present during the subsequent drying step can be incorporated in the aqueous solution either initially i.e., during the initial formation of the solution or prior to the holding period, or after the holding period and just prior to the subsequent drying step. The inclusion of this heat treatment step in preparing cold water soluble gelatins in accordance with the invention gives rise to a product which, on admixture with cold water, forms a gel having improved clarity. After preparing the aqueous solution comprising gelatin, sugar, and any additional materials desired according to the above disclosure, and optionally subjecting the solution to heat treatment as described above, the solution is applied in a thin layer to the surface of a suitable dryer, such as theBuflovak double drum vacuum drum dryer or vacuum drum dryer of similar type. Typically, the thickness of the layer will be within the range of from about 0.1 to about 3.0 millimeters. The surface of the dryer is preferably heated from the reverse side by steam to a temperature effective for drying the solution within a commercially practical period of time while maintaining the gelatin in the amorphous state.Typically, the residence time of the solution on the drying surface from the time of application to the time of complete drying will be less than about 5 minutes, preferably less than about 1 minute. Steam at a pressure of from about 5 to about 60 psig will be effective for supplying adequate heat. More typically, the steam pressure will be within the range of from about 5 to about 20 psig. The solution is dried on the surface under a reduced pressure. Absolute pressures of less than about 5 inches of mercury are effective. The reduced pressure causes rapid volatilization of the water within the solution and creates a light, friable, flaky product which exhibits good cold water solubility immediately after removal from the surface by means of a knife edged scraper blade or other suitable means. It is preferred, however, to further reduce and classify the particle size of the dried cold water soluble gelatin product to a more uniform size such as by grinding and screening. The dried material is preferably ground or otherwise comminuted and classified to a particle size of from about 20 to about 200 US mesh. Preferably, the particle size is such that at least about 90 percent of the particles will pass through 30 US mesh and most will be retained on 200 US mesh.This decrease in particle size compared with products previously described yields a cold water soluble gelatin having improved dispersibility and solubility. Most preferably, at least 40 percent of the particles will pass through 100 US mesh. Preferred bulk densities for the dry cold water soluble gelatin product of the invention will be within the range of from about 0.2 to about 0.3 grams per cubic centimeter. The cold water soluble gelatins prepared in accordance with the present invention possess significantly improved solubility and more rapid dispersibility in water and give rise to gels with improved clarity as compared with the products prepared in accordance with prior art procedures including those described in US Patents 4,401,685, 4,407,836 and 4,409,255. These improvements in properties of the cold water soluble gelatins are illustrated by the data set forth in the specific examples below. The dried cold water soluble gelatin product prepared according to the process of the invention can be compounded with other typical ingredients of dry gelatin dessert mixes to prepare a gelatin dessert mix which is, itself, cold water soluble. Typically, the dry gelatin dessert mix prepared according to the invention will comprise the cold water soluble gelatin plus additional amounts of sweeteners, acidulents, bluffers, flavors, antifoaming agents, and colors for the desired effect in the final product. Where these materials are not added to the solution prior to drying, they can be added by dry mixing with the cold water soluble gelatin product after drying by simple dry blending or by blending and agglomeration. Typically where the sugar employed in the dessert is sucrose, the ratio of sucrose to gelatin will be within the range of from about 9 15 1.And, where the acid is fumaric acid, the ratio of acid to gelatin will be within the range of from about 0.10 0.23 1. The buffer is preferably employed in an amount effective to adjust the pH of the final product to within the range of from about 3 to about 4.5. The flavorants and colorants are used in widely varying amounts, depending upon the desired end effect. The cold water soluble gelatin dessert can also contain vitamin and mineral supplements if desired. The following examples are intended to further illustrate and explain the present invention but are not be taken as limiting in any regard Example 1 This example describes the preparation of a cold water soluble gelatin product according to the invention.

Thereafter the solution solids content about 60 is cooled to about 115 F and maintained at this temperature while it is fed slowly into a double drum, steam heated vacuum dryer in which a thin film of the solution is applied to the rolls which have been adjusted to provide a gap of about 0.01 inches there between.The drum dryer is operated using a steam pressure on the rolls of 10 15 psig and an overall vacuum gauge of about 26 27 ins. of mercury in the drying chamber. The dried product is scraped continously from the rolls using a doctor blade and the dried, flaky, cold water soluble gelatin is collected. The dried material is then ground gently in a slow speed rotating disc grinder and sifted through a 30 U.S. mesh screen to provide a cold water soluble gelatin powder.

Each of the dessert mixes and desserts is prepared using the procedure and ingredients set forth inExample 14 but replacing the cold water soluble gelatin there used by an equal amount of the appropriate cold water soluble gelatin of Examples 17 to 22. The finished gelatin desserts so prepared, with the exception of that prepared from Run 20C, exhibit smooth, clear spoonable gels and are of a consistency suitable for consumption. The dessert prepared from cold water soluble gelatin Run 20C exhibited slight pebbling but was acceptable in all other respects. The four tests described in Example 3 are carried out on each of the above dessert mixes and desserts with the following results.Cold Dis Surface Pene trome ter Water persion skin .
