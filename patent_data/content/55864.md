# Catalyst and use of same for polymerizing olefins.

## Abstract
In one embodiment of this invention, a chromium component is supported on a silica aluminum orthophos phate combination and used with an organometal cocatalyst. In accordance with other embodiments of the invention, the silica phosphate combination for a chromium catalyst sup port is produced by either impregnating a silica xerogel with aluminum phosphate or boron phosphate, precipitating aluminum phosphate in the presence of a silica hydrogel, or physically mixing silica and aluminum phosphate xerogels. The resulting catalysts are capable of producing high melt flow olefin polymers and exhibit high activity. The resulting polymers have many unusual and desirable characteristics, such as high density and good environmental stress crack resistance.
