## Description
RE VERY OF GROU DRILLING U PMENT The present invention relates to recovery of equipment lost underground during drilling such as rock drilling, water well drilling and oil well drilling. Herein this equipment is referred to as ground drilling equipment Ground dialing equipment includes, for a typical 4 102 mm diameter bore hole, a down the hole drilling hammer with a 4 102 mm diameter bit and a string of 23 4 70 mm diameter drilling tubes extending down from a drilling platform to the hammer. Individual drilling tubes may be 9 ft. 2750 an long and consist of 1 8 3 mm wall thickness tubing having male screw coupling fittings at one end and female fittings at the other end.From time to time the string breaks, generally at a weld between a fitting and the tubing, or less frequently in the middle of the tubb g of a tube. Extractors exist for recovering the equipment left down the bore hole in the event of a breakageConventional extractors consist of a stepped cone having screw thread cn both conical portion as may be seen inFigure 1. which is a side view of a conventional extractor.When the breakage has occurred at the bottom of one drilling tube, where its tubing is welded to a fitting, the smaller conical portion la engages in a central bore provided in the fitting, provided for the supply of compressed air to the hammer. Although the extractor is hardened, its conical thread often fails to cut a thread in the fitting s cental bore since the fitting is itself bardened to lengthen the life of its ow thread. If the fitting is successf lly threaded, the new thread is unlikely to extend or more than two threads on account of the taper This length of thread may well prove insufficient to lift the weight of the 1GSt equipment. If the breakage has occurred at the top of a tube or in the middle, the larder diameter conical portionIb of the extractor will engage the tubing. There should be no problem with hardness here, but again only two threads may be cut, the tube being typically only approximately i 3 mm thick for 2k 70 mm tubing. The object of the invention is to improve the chances of recovering lost equipment. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided ground drilling equipment having at least one rotatably engageable adaption which is not utilized during normal use of the equipment and which is arranged to cooperate with a complementary rotatably engageable extractor for recovery of the equipment in the event of loss of the equipment. According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided an extractor for recovering ground drill ing equipment in accordance with the first aspect of the invention, the extractor having a rotatably engageable adaption. .omplementary to tile adaption of the drilling equipment and means including a boss for coupling the extractor to a string of drilling tubes. According to A third aspect O the lnzz elltior there is provided a metllod of recovering ground driliing equipment consisting in feeding an extractor of the second aspect of the invention to lost drilling equipment of the first aspect, the extractor being coupled to a recoverystring of drilling tubes engaging the rotatably engageable adaption of the lost drilling equipment with the complementary rotatably engageable adaption of the extractor and withdrawing the recovery string of drilling tubes, the extractor and the lost drilling equipment. For recovering a string of drilling tubes, the extractor comprises an elongate screw threaded member and a boss from which the threaded member extends. Pre ferably, the boss is adapted to be connected to a recovery string by means of a female thread. For recovery with this extractor, the drilling tubes are provided with a female thread in the central bores of the fittings, the thread being complementary to that of the elongate threaded member. Although it is possible for the thread to be included in only one of the male and female fittings, the other being bored out to pass the elongate member of the extractor, it is preferred that both fittings of a drilling tube are provided with the female thread.Further, it is preferred that the male fittings are counter bored along the axial extent of their male threads, to allow engagement of the extractor in an adjacent female flitting where a male thread has broken off. Preferably the elongate member is of sufficient length to pass through the ull length of one tube. This enables the fitting at the far end of a broken tube to be engaged when the fitting at the near end has broken off. The end of the elongate member remote from the boss is preferably pointed to provide self centring when a fitting is engaged. Preferably the elongate member has an axial compressed air bore. An indication of whether the extractor has engaged the lost equipment can be gained by passing air through the extractor. If it has engaged the hammer will start operating. To further improve the drilling tube fittings and the extractor, it is proposed that the spanner flats thereon should be shallower than the presently used flats which are machined to the extent of defining a square which is continuous in cross section across the fittings, see flats 2 on conventional extractor shown in Figure 1. Further it is proposed that the flats at right angles to each other should be longitudinally spaced. However, conventional square section flats may be used. It is envisaged that normally the invention will be employed in respect of drilling tubes in the range of diameters 2i .64 mm to 51 2 1285 mm but it may also be employed for a larger range of drilling tubes for example li 38 mm to 8 2040 mn . Another equipment breakage which can occur is failure of the shock absorber in the hammer. The shock absorber connects the hammer. to the drilling string with the result that the hammer is lost down the hole if the shock absorber breaks For recovery of the hammer, it is preferably provided witb a pair of bayonet fitting slors and an extractor is provided with a complementary pair of bayonet fitting dogs. Preferably the bayonet slots are directed In the normal direction of rotation ise. clockwise, and the trailing edges of the slots are chamfered to keep the slots clear of drilling debris. To help understanding of the invention, various embodiments thereof will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a side view cf a conventional extractor Figure 2 is a side view partly sectioned of a drilling tube in accordance with the invention Figure 3 is a side view of a drilling tube extractor in accordance with the invention Figure 4 is a side view of a hammer having a broken shock absorber and of a hammer extractor in accordance with the invention and Figure 5 is a plan view on line V V in Figure 4. The drilling tube 3 shown in Figure 2 has an upper female screw coupling fitting 4 and a lower male screw coupling fitting 5, both fittings being welded to tubing at eld 6 and having spigots 7 that extend into the tubing It is at eLths t the welds 6 that the tube is most likely to fail. The male fitting 4 has a male screw threaded end 8 adapted to screw into the female screw threaded socket 9 of another tube The fittings are hardened to prolong the life of the threads at 8,9 , The threads may be of standard Whltworth profile or rope threads for example and may be tapered.To facilitate unscrewing of joined male and female fittings they are provided with spanner flats 10 which do not extend across as much of the width of the fittings as they might to obviate the risk of jam ming against a loose rock in a bored hole. The fittings are provided with screw threaded bores 13, 14 for engagement by the extractor 15 described below with reference to Figure 3. The bore 14 in the male fitting 5 is counter bored at 15 to ensure that should all or part of the wale end 8 break away from the fitting 5, the extractor can engage in an adequate length of thread 13 in a female fitting into which the male end 8 is screwed without interference from an out of true thread in the fractured male ends As shown the thread in the female fitting 5 does not extend into the spigot 7. As shown in Figure 3, the extractor 15 has an elongate threaded member 17 attached to a boss 18 similar to the male fitting 4 whereby the extractor may be fitted to the end of a recovery string of drilling tubes for feeding through a hole to a lost string of other drilling tubes. The member 17 may be integral with the boss 18 but is preferably threaded and possibly pinned or otherwise fitted thereto.The elongate member is of sufficient length to pass through the tube 3 to engage the thread 14 in the female fitting 5 should the male fitting come away from the tube at its weld 6. Fsr use with 2 4 70 mm diameter, 9 ft 2750 mm long drilling t bess the extractor IS ii ft 3355 mm iong and its elongate member is 13 8 35 mm in diameter. The forward end of the elongate member of the extractor is pointed at 19 to guide the tool towards the axis of a broken drilling tube in the event of the extractor reaching the tube eccentrically.A bore 20 extends along the length of the elongate member 17 to pass compressed air into the recovered string of drilling tubes An indication of engagement of the elongate member in a thread 13, 14 of the lost equipment is provided by thecompressed air working the lost drilling mer at the far end of the lost string Figures 4 and 5 show a drilling hammer 21 which has been lost following fracture of its shock absorber 22 at 23, the shock absorber normally connecting the hammer to its drill string. In accordance with the invention the hammer has a pair of diametrically opposite bayonetfitting slots 24 which are complementary to a pair of dogs 25 provided on an extractor 26. To retrieve th hammer, the tool 26 is brought into contact with the hammer and rotated until the dogs 25 engage in the slots 24 A counter bore 27 is provided in a boss of the extractor to accommodate the shock absorber. As may be seen in Figure 5 the trailing edges 28 of the slots are chamfered to obviate the accumulation of drilling debris in the slots. For the same reason the slots are directed in the direction of nominal hainnier rotation so that debris does not accumulate at the forward end 29 of the foot of the slots.
