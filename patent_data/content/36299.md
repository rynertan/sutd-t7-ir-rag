# Cycle derailleur.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a rear derailleur for a cycle said derailleur comprising a main derailleur body A provided with a base member 2 and a movable member 4 connected thereto so as to be movable axially of said sprockets and relative to said base member 2 . A chain shift means B provided with a pulley plate 6 is pivotally mounted on said movable member 4 , and a guide pulley 9 and tension pulley 10 are rotatably mounted on said pulley plate 6 . First and second guard plates 14,15 are formed and arranged on the opposite side of said guide and tension pulleys 9,10 respectively, from said pulley plate 6 for preventing lateral disengagement of the drive chain C . The first guard plate 14 is formed and arranged with its front edge 14a disposed radially inwardly of the outer periphery of the tension pulley 10 and in proximity to the centre of the latter. In known such derailleurs there is a risk of the wheel spokes being trapped between the tension pulley 10 and the first guard plate means 14 . According to this invention a pulley cap 16 is provided between the tension pulley 10 and first guard plate 14 , said pulley cap 16 having a central portion 16a and a radially outer portion 160 extending into contact with or close proximity to the side of the tension pulley 10 for preventing entry of a spoke therebetween, the radially outer portion 16a of the cap 16 extending radially outwardly of the front edge 14a of the first guard plate 14 .
