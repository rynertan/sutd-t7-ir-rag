# A positioning device comprising pre stressed contactless bearings.

## Abstract
A Positioning device having a plate shaped carrier 5 which is slidably supported on a table 1 and is displaceable in a horizontal plane and on which a pressure force and a tensile force, respectively, are exerted by means of at least two translatory drives 11, 13 . The translatory drives 11, 13 are coupled to the carrier 5 by means of horizontallyoperating static thrust and tensile bear ings, respectively 33 to 41, 49 which via a viscous medium transmit pressure and tensile forces, respectively between the carrier 5 and the translator drives 11, 13 in a contactless manner. The contact less bearings 33 to 41, 49 are pre stressed with a force which is larger than the maximum tensile force occurring between the drives 11, 13 and the carrier 5 . Thus a substantially frictionless coupling is obtained between the drives 11, 13 and the carrier 5 . This coupling acts at the same time as a guide for the carrier 5 .

## Description
The invention relates to a positioning device comprising a horizontal plate shaped carrier which is slidably supported on a flat table and is displaceable in two orthogonal coordinate directions, which device is provided with a first translatory drive coupled to the carrier for exerting a pressure force on the carrier in a first coordinate direction and with a second translatory drive coupled to the carrier for exerting a pressure force on the carrier in a second coordinate direction at right angles to the first coordinate direction, the forces exerted on the carrier by the first and the second drive acting in one horizontal plane. In the known positioning device of the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph US PS No. 3466514 , the translatory drives coupled to the carrier are constituted by a screw spindle, opposite which a spring loaded plunger is arranged. The directions of movement of the screw spindle and the plunger coincide with each other. A pressure contact with a comparatively high degree of frcition exists between the end of the screw spindle and the end of a plunger rod connected to the plunger on the one hand and the carrier on the other hand. This friction is undesirable due to the hysteresis attendant thereon, especially if the carrier has to perform very small displacements in the micron and submicron range. The invention has for its object to provide a positioning device in which the above disadvantages are avoided. For this purpose the invention is characterized in that the first drive is coupled to the carrier in a contactless manner by means of a first horizontally operating static thrust and tensile bearing, respectively, via a viscous medium, while the second drive is coupled to the carrier in a contactless manner by means of a second horizontally operating thrust and tensile bearing, respectively, via a viscous medium, bot the first and the second thrust and tensile bearings, res pectively, being pre stressed in the first and second coordinate direction, respectively, with a force which is larger than the maximum tensile force occurring between the first and the second drive on the one hand and the carrier on the other hand. By the use of pre stressed contactless bearings as coupling means between the drives and the carrier, substantially the whole amount of friction between the drives and the carrier is eliminated only a very small viscous friction remains present so that hysteresis problems are avoided. The pre stressed state of the contactless bear ings renders it possible to exert with the drives a tensile force on the carrier so that in fact a thrust tensile bearing is formed. The bearings have a dual function because they serve as guide and as coupling. It should be noted that British Patent Application 2067932 discloses a positioning device comprising a vertically operating aerostatic thrust bearing which can be pre stressed by a spring. How ever, this thrust bearing serves for horizontally guiding the carrier on a table. The coupling of the spindle drives to the carrier is effected by means of pivots. A particular embodiment of the positioning device according to the invention, in which the carrier can perform besides the trans lations in the two coordinate directions also a rotation about a vertical axis, is further characterized in that the device is provided with a third translatory drive coupled to the carrier for exerting a pressure force and a tensile force, respectively, on the carrier in a direction parallel to the second coordinate direction, the first, the second and the third drive each being pivotable about a vertical axis with respect to the carrier. A further embodiment of the positioning device, in which the pre stress of the three bearings is obtained in a constructionally simple manner, is characterized in that the first, the second and the third bearing are pre stressed by means of a permanent magnet arranged therein. A preferred embodiment of the positioning device, in which load variations lead to a comparatively small variation of the bearing capacity, is further characterized in that a part of the magnetic cir cuit corresponding to the permanent magnet is in the state of magnetic saturation. A still further embodiment of the positioning device, which is suitable for use in conditioned rooms, is characterized in that the viscous medium is air. A further embodiment of the positioning device having a comparatively simple arrangement of the permanent magnets is characterized in that the second and the third bearing are pre stressed by means of a number of permanent magnets common to both bearings, which are ar ranged in the carrier. A still further embodiment of the positioning device, in which the carrier has a comparatively high degree of rigidity against rotation about a vertical axis, is further characterized in that the second and the third bearing are coupled to each other by means of a beam shaped guide, which is pivotable with respect to the second and the third drive about a vertical axis, while the first drive is pivotable about a vertical axis with respect to the carrier. The invention will be described more fully with reference to the drawings, in which The first embodiment of a positioning device shown in Fig. 1 comprises a fixedly arranged flat table 1 in the form of a rectangular planoparallel plate, the sides of which are located in horizontal planes. A rectangular plate shaped carrier 5 is slidably supported on the upper surface 3 of the table 1 by four multiple vertically operating aerostatic thrust bearings 7, which are arranged near the corners of the carrier 5. On the carrier 5 is disposed an object 9 to be positioned, which object is plate shaped and which can be secured on the carrier by, for example, vacuum suction means. The object 9 may be, for example, a wafer of semiconductor material used in semi conductor technology. The carrier 5 can be displaced in a first coor dinate direction X by means of a translatory drive 11, which is of the so called linear type, while it can be displaced in a second coordinate direction Y by means of a similar translatory drive 13. A third trans latory drive 15 of a similar kind to the drives 11 and 13 serves at the same time to rotate the carrier 5 through an angle The drives 11, 13 and 15 have straight rods 21, 23 and 25, which can perform translations in the X direction, the Y direction and the Y direction, respectively, the latter direction being parallel to the Y direction and lying in the X Y plane. The rotation In Fig. 10, the curve I represents the bearing capacity of the bearing. It is assumed that the working point R is located in the middle of a region of the curve I, which is characterized by a sub stantially constant rigidity As appears from Fig. 10, there is operated in a region of magnetic gaps in which there exists a linear relation between the magnetic attraction force F and the magnetic gap H If it is assumed that the load of the bearing is subjected to a variation Î”W In the case of a rectangular carrier 5, the thrust bearings 7 can be arranged near the corners of the carrier, as shown diagramma tically in Fig. 1, or near the centres of the sides of the carrier, as shown in Figures 2, 6, 7, 8 and 11. The thrust bearings 7 for supporting the carrier 5 in the Z direction are preferably arranged in the manner shown in Figures 2, 6, 7, 8 and 11 for the sake of constructional simplicity. Each of the four thrust bearings 7 is com posed of an assembly of nine permanent samarium cobalt magnets 77, which are separated from each other by eight magnet yokes 79 of magnetically good conducting material, such as mild steel. The assembly of nine magnets 77 is separated from a box shaped holder 81 of poor magnetically conducting material, such as, for example, aluminium, by two magnet yokes 83 and 85 of mild steel. The magnets 77 and the magnet yokes 79, 83 and 85 are plate shaped and rectangular. The direction of magnetization of the two assemblies of magnets 77 extending parallel to the X direction is parallel to the X direction, while the direction of magnetization of the two assemblies of magnets 77 ex tending parallel to the Y direction is parallel to the Y direction Figures 7, 8 and 11 . However, these directions of magnetization may alternatively be as indicated in Figure 2, The air bearings 7 are magnetically pre stressed with a force F In the second embodiment of the displacement arrangement shown in Fig. 4, there are only two coordinate directions X and Y the drive in the third coordinate direction Y is omitted in this case. Further more, the rod 23 is connected rigidly to the supporting foot 29 at the point 93. However, the rod 21 is pivotally connected to the sup porting feet 24 in the same manner as in the displacement arrangement shown in Figures 1, 2, 3 and 6. As a result, a small angular adjust ment Î± can be obtained if an alignment of the carrier 5 with respect to the table 1 is necessary. A small displacement of the rod 23 in the Y direction permits of obtaining such an angular adjustment Î±. This angular adjustment in fact is a pre adjustment or calibration, which precedes the displacements which have to bring the object to the working point P. The supporting feet 27 and 29 are again provided with permanent magnets, magnet yokes and air supply ducts, while the carrier 5 is provided with magnetically conductive plates as described in the positioning device shown in Fig. 1. The positioning device shown in Figure 4 belongs to the category in which a rotation The third embodiment of the positioning device shown in Fig. 5 again belongs to the category in which a rotation In all the positioning devices described above, drives 11, 13 and 15 are used which will be described hereinafter with re ference to Fig. 12. The translatory drive shownin Fig. 12 comprises a direct current motor 97, which drives a shaft 109 through a flexible coupling 99 and a series of frictional wheels 101, 103, 105 and 107. The rods 21, 23 and 25 each have two coplanar, longitudinally extending flat surfaces 115 and 117, and by means of two pairs of freely rota table pressure rollers 111 and 113 which are spaced apart by a certain distance see also Fig. 2 the rods 21, 23 and 25 are pressed with the flat surfaces 115 and 117 against the relevant driving shaft 109. The pressure rollers 111 and 113 are inclined with respect to a vertical plane and are journalled in a block 119 which is acted upon by a pressure force 121 provided by a spring not shown . The rolling friction between the shaft 109 and the flat surfaces 115 and 119 of the rods 21, 23 and 25 oridyces a translation of these rods in the X , Y and Y directions respectively. The rods 21, 23 and 25 each carry a strip shaped measuring scale 123 which extends in the X , Y and Y direction, respectively, and which has alternating regions of compara tively strong and comparatively weak reflectivity onto which a light beam 125 is projected by means of a mirror 127 and a lens 129. The reflected light beam is detected by a photodetector arranged in a measuring device 131 in a manner not shown. The measurement signal thus obtained is processed in an electrical servo loop and is then fed back to the electric motor 97. The optical measuring device roughly described above is of the usual kind and is therefore not described in detail. It should be noted that the measuring direction coincides with the X , Y and Y direction, respectively, as a result of which so called Abbe errors or tilting errors are avoided. In all the positioning devices described above air of gas bear ings are used for the vertically operating thrust bearings 7. However, alternatively a liquid may be used as a viscous medium in the thrust bearings 7. In that case it is necessary for the outflowing liquid to be collected in a satisfactory manner. Although essentially a liquid may be used as a viscous medium for the horizontally operating thrust tensile bearings, preferably a gas is used because of the relatively complicated collecting means required for a liquid. The vertical thrust bearings may also be replaced by accurate roller or ball bearings, while sliding bearings are also possible. The pre tension of the viscous contactless bearings can be obtained by means of a weight, a vacuum, a spring or electromagnetically for the vertically operating thrust bearings and by means of vacuum, a spring or electromagnetically for the horizontally operating thrust tensile bearings. In the case of an electromagnetic pre tension, the permanent magnets are replaced by an electromagnet whose excitation can be controlled by means of a sensor by which the size of the air gap is measured. The magnetic attraction force can then be controlled so that variations in the load of the air bearing or liquid bearing are fully compensated for by an adapted excitation. A variation of the magnetic attraction force F corresponding thereto is indicated in Fig. 10 by the dot dash line IV. It should be noted that the usual electromagnetic bearings which do not use of a viscous medium originating from a pressure source do not fall within the scope of the invention. Such electromagnetic bearings are in fact of the dynamic type, whereas according to the invention viscous bearings of the static type with an external pressure source are used. Instead of an assembly of permanent magnets, according to the invention a single permanent magnetmay be used for each rod 21, 23 and 25. Essentially, it is also possible to use a single magnet for the vertical support of the carrier. The required stiffness against tilting of the carrier 5 can be obtained more readily,however, by several magnets or, as described, by several assemblies of magnets. Although the invention has been described with reference to a translatory drive or a linear drive with friction couplings, other known linear drives may alternatively be used. Such linear drives may be, for example, screw and nu drives or drives with a shaft guided by rollers or balls. Essentially, any drive can be used in which a reciprocating translatory movement in either of the reciprocal direction is imparted to the carrier 5 by the action of a force from one side of the carrier 5. The described static viscous bearings with an external pressure source may be of different types with regard to the restriction used between the pressure source and the gas and liquid gap, respectively. More particularly, the possibility of the use of a diaphragm compensated viscous bearing is mentioned. With such a bearing, which is known
