# A CAPACITANCE HUMIDITY SENSOR AND A METHOD FOR PREPARATION THEREOF

## Abstract
A capacitance humidity sensor according to the invention comprises a non conductive base plate 10 , electrodes 12 , 12 oppositely arranged on the base plate 1 , a metal compound membrane 14 formed independent ly on the electrodes 12 , 12 , said metal compound membrane 14 being active to the humidity, and a moisture permeable metal skin 16 formed on the metal compound membrane. The metal compound membrane 14 may be made of metal oxide or nitride and is preferably roughened at its surface by plasma etching.
