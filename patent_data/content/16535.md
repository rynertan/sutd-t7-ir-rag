# Copolymers of tert butylstyrene, a process for making the copolymers, and use of the copolymers as additives to liquid hydrocarbon fuels.

## Abstract
Copolymers are described of at least 75 by weight of tert butyl styrene, from 1 to 24 by weight of a copolymerisable second monomer and from 1 to 10 by weight of methacrylic acid, the copolymers having certain specified solubility and rheological characteristics in AVTUR 50 aviation kerosene. A process for making the copolymers by aqueous emulsion polymerisation of the monomers under certain defined conditions is also described. The copolymers are useful as additives to liquid hydrocarbon aircraft fuels for the purpose of reducing the tendency of such fuels to form inflammable mists under shock conditions.
