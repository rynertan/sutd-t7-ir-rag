# Polymer compositions containing magnetically susceptible fillers.

## Abstract
The invention provides a method of influencing the orien tation of the polymer molecules in a melt of molecularly orientable polymer by subjecting a composition containing the polymer and a megnetically susceptible filler to a magne tic field of at least 0.005 Tesla prior to or during the formation of a shaped article from the melt. Compositions for use in the invention comprise a thermoplastic polymer and at least 0.05 by weight of a magnetically susceptible filler, particu larly a ferrite. The invention is most easily applied to thermo tropic polymer compositions.
