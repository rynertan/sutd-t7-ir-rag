## Description
FOOTBALL GAME BOARD BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The popularity of the sport of football has resulted in the development of many board games designed to simulate the strategy and rules of the real game.Many of these board games use standard, six sided dice to generate random plays and outcomes. This severely limits the range of possible plays and outcomes, and results in a gross oversimplification of the game. Other board games utilize data sheets or a statistically weighted card system to create a greater range of plays and outcomes. While these games do approach realism in terms of likelihood of outcome, they generally lack the excitement and spontaneity desired in a board game. OBJECTS OP THE INVENTION It is an object of this invention to provide a football game board that replicates the range of possible plays and the probability of their outcomes in the game of football. It is a further object of this invention to provide a football game board that can be played without the use of comprehensive data sheets or cards to generate the plays and outcomes. It is a further object of this invention to provide a football game board that instructs the players in the concepts and rules of the official game. It is a further object of this invention to provide a football game board that is compact, portable and easily set up for play. Other objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the description to follow, particularly when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention comprises a football type game board utilizing specially designed, dice like casting solids to represent the various plays used in the game of football.Each solid or die has a plurality of sides or facets, with markings on each side denoting a particular outcome to that play. The number of sides and their markings are designed to reflect the range of possible outcomes and their probability of occurring, so that the throwing of the solids in a dice like manner generates results similar to those which could be expected in a real football game. Also provided is a penalty card system organized into four categories rushing, passing, kicking and return , so that when a penalty is indicated by the casting solids, selection of a card from the appropriate category will produce a realistic penalty for that type of play. Also provided is a first down marker system with a down indicator sleeve, for easy player reference.

IF illustrates the various defensive casting solids. FIG. 2 is a top view of the game board and first down marker system used in the football game board. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring now to FIGS. 1A through 1F with greater particularity, the football type game board of this invention includes special dice like casting solids used to represent the types of plays in football. These solids are used in a logical order, following official football rules and replicating the action of a real game. To initiate play, the players may toss a coin to determine which player will kick and which player will receive the ball. The kicking player then uses a kickoff random selection device, which may be in the form of a casting solid or die 2 FIG. 1B which has a plurality of sides or facets 4 each of which is marked with a different number 6, denoting the length of the kick. In addition, one of the sides is marked out for out of bounds. A decahedron, or ten sided polyhedron, was chosen for the kickoff die to give a representative range of kickoff distances, e.g.from 40 to 70 yards, with an average of 57 yards, and one out of ten kickoffs going out of bounds. This is believed to be reflective of actual kickoff statistics, but a different number of sides on the casting solid and or different yardage indicated on those sides could of course be chosen within the scope of this invention. On every play, including the kickoff, the player also throws the referee die 8 FIG. 1A , at least one side 10 of which is marked with some indicia 12, such as a P to indicate a penalty. A decahedron was also chosen for the referee die 8 so that, with only one side marked P , the odds are that a penalty will be called in 10 of the plays, believed to be a realistic statistic. When a penalty is called by throw of the referee die 8, the player must draw a card from one of four categories of penalty cards, 14, 16, 18 and 20 depending on the type of play during which the penalty was called e.g. rushing, passing, kicking or return. These cards are variously labeled with typical penalties that occur for the given type of play, so that a realistic penalty is given. For example, the kicking play category includes cards that indicate an offensive fifteen yard penalty for clipping, a defensive fifteen yard penalty for piling on, and other kicking play related penalties.The passing play category, by contrast, includes cards that indicate an offensive ten yard penalty for an ineligible receiver down field, a defensive pointof infraction first down penalty for pass interference and so on The player receiving the kickoff may, at his option, choose to attempt a kick return. This is accomplished by the casting of the optional offensive return casting solid 22 FIG. 1D . The option to throw this offense return die 22 is with the offensive player in possession of the football, i.e. the offensive player on scrimmage plays and the receiving player in a change of possession, as in returning a kick, recovering a fumble or a blocked kick, or intercepting a pass.An icosahedron, or twenty sided polyhedron, was chosen for this optional die, and its sides 24 are marked with indicia 26 to reflect the outcome of the runback. For example, one side may show a fumble F one side may show a touchdown TD fourteen sides may show yardage gained over a range of, say, 1 to 30 yards and the remaining sides may have indicia reflecting no gains or losses. If, in throwing the optional offensive return die 22, a fumble is generated, one player must additionally throw the recovery die 28 to determine which player recovers the fumble. In the preferred embodiment, the player responsible for the throwing of recovery die 28 is that player who first picks up said die after observing the indication of a fumble As shown in FIG. 1E, the recovery die may be football shaped, with four sides 30 having indicia 32 thereon to denote the recovery. Two sides may be marked DEF REC. and two sides marked OFF. REC. to give each player an even chance of recovery, but this could also be varied. The player thus awarded the recovery of such a fumble may, at his option, attempt to advance the ball by casting the previously described optional offensive return die 22. When the kickoff is completed, play from scrimmage is initiated by the offensive player by casting offensive casting solids 34, 36, 38, 40 and 42. In FIG.1C, these offensive casting solids 34, 36, 38, 40 and 42 are shown to be footballshaped with four sides 44 marked at 46 either pass or run and with a number representing a short gain. The offensive player calls pass or run as he throws the solids and only those numbers on the correct sides are totalled to show the net gain passing or running. This results in a range of offensive outcomes of from 0 to 10 yards average 3 to 4 yards running, and from 0 to 21 yards average 6 to 7 yards passing, to be reflective of actual offensive statistics. The offensive player may, at his option, also throw the optional die 22 which may produce 5 to 30 yards to be added to the already generated offensive outcome, with a 5 chance of a fumble, and a 5 chance of a touchdown. As before, if a fumble is indicated, one player must then additionally throw the recovery casting solid 28, to determine who recovered the fumble, and the recovering player may, at his option, attempt to advance the ball by casting the optional offensive return die 22. In an appropriate situation, the offensive player may throw the punting die 35, the sides 37 of which are marked with indicia 39 to indicate the success of the punt. The punting die 35 FIG. 1B may also be a twentysided polyhedron, with one side marked B to show the punt was blocked and the remaining sides marked with numbers reflective of a realistic punting performance, e.g. 20 to 65 yards, with an average of about 39 yards. When using the punting die 35, the player must also cast an in bounds out of bounds die 41, the sides 43 of which are marked with some indicia 45 denoting either an in bounds or out of bounds punt. The in bounds out of bounds die 40 may be a four sided, football shaped solid with two sides marked IN and two sides marked OUT , giving a 50 chance of a kick going out of bounds. If a blocked punt is indicated, and the punt did not go out of bounds, one player must then additionally throw the recovery die 28 to determine who recovered the ball, and then the player recovering the ball may attempt to advance it by throwing the optional offensive return die 22. An unblocked, in bounds punt may be returned by the receiving player, by casting the offensive return die 22. The offensive player may wish to cast field goal die 47, the sides 48 of which are marked with some indicia 50 to denote the success or failure of the attempt.The field goal die 47 may also have twenty sides marked to provide a one in twenty chance of being blocked, a three in twenty chance of missing wide and the remaining sides calling for a range of field goal kick distances of, say, 35 to 65 yards. In order for a particular field goal attempt to be successful, the yardage shown on indicia 50 must be equal to or greater than the distance from the line of scrimmage to the goal post 10 yards deep in the end zone . For example, an indication of a 35 yard kick would result in a successful field goal if such a kick had been attempted from the ten yard line, but the same kick would be unsuccessful if it had been attempted from the 30 yard line. If a field goal attempt is blocked, one player must then cast the recovery die 28 to determine either an offensive or defensive recovery, and the player recovering the ball may attempt to advance the ball by casting the optional off ensive return die 22. After scoring a touchdown, the offensive player may throw an extra point die 52, the sides 54 of which are marked with indicia 56 to denote either a successful or unsuccessful extra point attempt As shown, the extra point die 52 may also be a twenty sided polyhedron, with one side marked B for a blocked attempt, one side marked missn and the remaining sides marked G for good, giving a 90 chance of a successful extra point. The offensive player may, in a kickoff situation, cast an onside kick die 58 the sides 60 each of which are marked with indicia 62 to indicate the distance of the kick, and whether it was recovered by the kicking player. For example, the onside kick die 58 may be an octahedron, or eight sided polyhedron, with its sides marked to show the distance, e.g. 9 to 16 yards, and some of the sides, e.g. three of them, are also marked with an asterisk to denote recovery of the ball by the kicking player. The player recovering the onside kick may attempt to advance the ball by throwing the optional offense return die 22. The defensive player also participates in the game by use of certain defensive maneuvers. For example, a goal linelpenetrating defense die 64 FIG. 1F may be thrown when such a defensive strategy is desired, its sides 66 being marked with some indicia 68 thereon, to denote some effect to the outcome as generated by the offensive casting solids 34 through 42. As shown, it may have twelve sides, with one side being marked F for fumble, one side marked no gain to negate any gain shown by the offensive solids, and five sides marked with short negative yardage to offset the offensive outcome. The remaining sides may be left blank to produce no effect on the offensive outcome. As before, if a fumble is indicated, one player must then additionally cast the recovery die 28, described earlier, to determine who recovered, and the player recovering such a fumble may, at his option, attempt to advance the ball by throwing the offensive return die 22. In another situation, the defensive player may cast a nickle defense die 70, the sides 72 of which are marked with indicia 74 to indicate some effect to the offensive outcome as generated by the offensive casting solids. The nickle defense casting solid 70 may also have twelve sides, one marked T to denote an interception, one with negative yardage, say 9, to denote a sacking of the quarterback, six sides 1 Inc for incomplete and the others marked C to show pass completion. If an interception is indicated, the defensive player may, at his option, attempt to advance the ball by throwing the optional offensivejreturn die 22. Alternatively, the defensive player may cast a blitz red dog defense die 76 the sides 78 of which are marked with indicia 80 to indicate its effect on the offensive outcome. The blitz red dog defense die 76 may also have twelve sides, two marked with negative yardage, e.g. 12 and 6, to denote quarterback sacks, one marked no gain, one marked Inc for incomplete and the others marked C for complete. Referring now to FIG. 2 with greater particularity, a game board 82 is provided to represent a football field. Playing piece 84 is moved up and down the field according to the outcomes generated by the casting solids. The first down marker system 86 utilizes a sideline mounted shaft 88 with a slidable sleeve 90 ten yards 1 in length to indicate the remaining yardage required for a first down. Sleeve 90 is further marked into four sections 92 which are labelled first down , second down , third down and fourth down , and are used to indicate the down by rotating the sleeve about the shaft axis. While this invention has been described in conjunction with a preferred embodiment thereof, it is obvious that modifications and changes therein may be made by those skilled in the art to which it pertains without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention, as defined by the Claims appended hereto.
