# Improvements in and relating to explosive cladding.

## Abstract
A method of applying a surface layer across a surface layer or joint between cladding layers 2 and 2A on a clad metal plate or plates comprises forming a shallow chamfer along each opposing cladding layer edge and positioning over the said chamfers a corrosion resistant metal flyer plate 3 having a shallow generally V shaped configuration, optionally applying a buffer layer 4 of transmitting medium placed on the outside surface of the flyer plate, further superimposing an explosive layer 5 upon the cladding 3 and buffer 4 layers and detonating the explosive layer 5 so as to weld the flyer plate material 3 at least to the cladding layers 2 and 2A . Advantageously a metal groove may be formed in the base metal layer of the clad plate to facilitate positioning of the flyer plate, the groove wall conveniently being extensions of the cladding chamfer surfaces. The method facilitates an assembly of a cladding strip and explosive layer over a joint between clad metal plates in any orientation and gives joints of high quality between the cladding layers on the plates.
