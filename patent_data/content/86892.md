# Heat sealable package blank for a video tape cassette or the like.

## Abstract
A heat sealable package blank for a video tape cassette C or the like made from a single heat sealable sheet which comprises first 1 and second 2 panels foldably provided on opposite sides of an elongate backstrip 3 . The first and second panels have first 4, 5 and second 14, 15 pairs of foldable side flaps, respectively, extending from their oppo site sides, and the backstrip has a pair of foldable back flaps 11, 12 extending from their opposite longitudinal ends. In order to protect the packaged product from damage due to heated air used in the fabrication of the package from the package blank, the first side flap pair 4, 5 and the back flap pair 11, 12 have sloping edges 9, 19 35, 36 for forming at least partly overlapping seams S when the blank is folded up. Further, at least either of the first side flap pair 4, 5 and the back flap pair 11, 12 is at least partly reduced in thickness at 6, 16 8, 18 to minimize the thickness of the overlapping seams and hence to avoid the surface irregular ities of the second side flap pair 14, 15 to be thermally fused thereto in overlying relationship.
