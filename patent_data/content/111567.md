# APPARATUS FOR PROCESSING REGENERATIVE ENERGY OF AC MOTOR.

## Abstract
An apparatus for processing the regenerative energy of an AC motor comprises a regeneration detecting logic circuit 7 outputting a regeneration detection signal when it detects that a semiconductor switch for an AC motor drive is not conductive and the direction of a current flowing through the AC motor is opposite to that when the AC motor is driven, and a regeneration drive circuit 9 driving a regenerative energy processing semiconductor switch in response to the regeneration detection signal. The regenerative energy pro cessing semiconductor switch is conductive only when the AC motor is regenerating to return the regenerative energy to an AC power source, so that the power consumption of a resistor protecting the regenerative energy processing semi conductor switch can be reduced to enable a reduction in the size thereof.
