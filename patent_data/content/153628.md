# Process for producing polyurethane compositions having low hysteresis.

## Abstract
This invention pertains to a process for the synthesis of polyurethane systems having low hysteresis. The systems are generated by reacting a prepolymer of a mononuclear diisocyanate and a polyol with a chain extender mix of a mononuclear aromatic diamine and a polyol. The prepolym er should have a free isocyanate content of from 2 to about 12 by weight and the chain extender mix should have an amine to polyol equivalent from about 0.5 to 5.1.
