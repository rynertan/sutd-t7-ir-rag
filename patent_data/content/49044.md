# Single roller idler assembly for a tracked undercarriage.

## Abstract
Means are described for bogie mounting a roller 94 to an idler 88 on a crawler track undercarriage 10 such that the benefits of load transfer and shock absorbance are provided for a single roller idler combi nation on a tracked vehicle. A tracked undercarriage 10 has a track frame 12 to which is pivotally mounted a support link 34 , and pivotally mounted thereto a bogie link 60 . Rotatably mounted on the bogie link 60 are an idler 88 and a roller 94 . Variations in ground level cause the bogie link 60 to rotate such that resilient pads 98, 106 are compressed thereby absorbing shock and so that the roller 94 is less heavily loaded and the idler 88 has its loading increased.
