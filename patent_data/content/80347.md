# Implantable dynamic pressure transducer system.

## Abstract
A pressure and motion transducer and cooperating cir cuitry for an implantable medical device are disclosed. The sys tem includes a pressure transducer 48 and buffer amplifier 40. A clock 70 in pacer 52 periodically energises amplifier 40 via capacitor 62 and lead system 54. The voltage sensed across sensing resistor 74 at node 78 is applied to sample and hold circuit 66 and a continuous pressure signal is provided at out put terminal 82.
