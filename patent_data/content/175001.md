# VERTICALLY MAGNETIZED MAGNETIC HEAD.

## Abstract
A vertically magnetized magnetic head which mag netizes a magnetic recording medium in the direction of thickness thereof. A main magnetic pole film consisting of a soft magnetic film having high permeability is held by first and second junction blocks made of a non magnetic materi al. A laminate of layers formed by alternately laminating a highly permeable soft magnetic layer and a non magnetic layer is provided in at least one of the above mentioned blocks at a position where it comes into contact with said highly permeable soft magnetic film, being separated by a predetermined distance from a position at which the block is in sliding contact with the magnetic recording medium.
