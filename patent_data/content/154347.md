# Differential pressure lubrication system for rolling piston compressor.

## Abstract
The lubricating oil pool 11 in the bottom of the shell 1 of a rolling piston refrigerant gas compressor is communicated directly with the space 16 inside the cylindrical piston 4 via a supply passage 10c in a side plate 10. Sufficient clearance is provided between the ends of the piston and the compressor side plates 9, 10 to enable limited communication between the space 16 and the compression and suction chambers 6, 18. The compressor discharge is supplied to the space 7 within the shell, and the resultant differential pressure applied to opposite ends of the supply passage causes a a steady flow of oil into the piston interior to properly lubricate the moving parts of the compressor.
