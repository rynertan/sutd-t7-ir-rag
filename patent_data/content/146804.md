# FUEL ASSEMBLY PERIPHERAL ROD LIFTING DEVICE

## Abstract
The specification discloses a device 32 for raising peripheral fuel rods of a fuel assembly for inspection under submerged conditions in a nuclear reactor facility. The device 32 includes a frame comprising top and bottom plates 36, 38 interconnected by rods 40 with an intermedi ate plate 52 supported therein for vertical movement responsive to a cylinder 60 . A yoke 64 is mounted for horizontal movement on the intermediate plate 52 respon sive to another cylinder 66 to engage a fuel rod so that it can then be lifted by the first cylinder 60 . Proper alignment relative to the peripheral rods of the fuel assembly is accomplished by means of pins 50 which are received in indexing holes 80 of a support plate 68 for the fuel assembly.
