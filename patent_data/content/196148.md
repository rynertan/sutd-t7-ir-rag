# Optical fibre switch.

## Abstract
A switch for switching a single fibre 1 to any one of a plurality of fibres 2 7 by aligning their end faces is composed of a funnel shaped guide 8 . The single fibre 1 is mounted in the narrow end portion of the guide 8 and the plurality of fibres 2 7 are held in the wide end of the guide. Each of the plurality of fibres is independently movable longitudinally into the guide, for example using electromagnetic actuators 10 15 , so that as a desired fibre moves further into the guide, its end is guided towards the narrow end where it will align with the end of the single fibre.
