The ligand L2 typically includes macrocyclic compounds containing oxygen, nitrogen or sulphur as the electron donor atoms, as well as macrocyclic compounds containing nitrogen oxygen, sulphur nitrogen, sulphuroxygen and nitrogen sulphur oxygen donor atoms. Such macrocyclic compounds include cyclic polyethers socalled crown ethers , cyclic polyamines and cyclic polythioethers, as well as the mixed donor macrocyclic compounds containing oxygen and or nitrogen and or sulphur.An extensive review of such compounds is given, for example, by J. J. Christensen et al. in Chemical Reviews 1974 , 74, 3 , 351 384. Preferably, the macrocyclic ligand L2 is a cyclic polyether or crown ether which may be achiral or chiral.Especially preferred ligands include those having the following structures, the nomenclature used being that devised by Pedersen, J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 89, 7017 1967 for macrocyclic polyethers, whereby each name consists of, in order 1 the number and kind of hydrocarbon rings, 2 the total number of atoms in the polyether ring, 3 the class name, crown , and 4 the number of oxygen atoms in the polyether ring EMI5.1 N,N dimethyl12 Crown 4 diaza 12 Crown 4EMI5.2 15 Crown 5 18 Crown 6EMI5.3 Dibenzo 18 Crown 6 Dicyclohexyl 18 Crown 6 EMI6.1 Bisthreitolo 18 Crown 6 Glvcosido 18 Crown 6EMI6.2 N,N ,N trimethyl Dimethylenemannitolo 20 Crown 6 triaza 18 Crown 6EMI6.3 Bisbinaphtho 22 Crown 6 EMI7.1 Dibenzo 24 Crown 8 Dibenzo 30 Crown 10EMI7.2 Bisdianhydromannitolo 30 Crown 10EMI7.3 Dibenzo 36 Crown 12 The compounds of the invention are typically prepared by mixing aqueous or non aqueous solutions of the transition metal complex and the macrocyclic ligand so as to form the desired adduct of the transition metal complex with the macrocyclic ligand, which adduct may precipitate directly from the reaction mixture or be precipitated by the further addition of a suitable solvent. The compounds of the invention include not only those adducts of transition metal complexes with macrocyclic ligands which are stable in the solid state, but also adducts which are detectable, e.g. by spectro scope, in aqueous and or non aqueous solution. Specific novel compounds according to the invention include compounds having the following formulae PMe3 PtCl2NH3 2.18 crown 6 I PEt3 PtC12NH3 2.18 crown 6 II PMe3 PtCl2NH3.dibenzo 18 crown 6 III Pet3 PtCl2NH3.dibenzo 8 crown 6 IV C2H4 PtCl2.NH3 3 18 crown 6 2 V Bipy Pt NH3 2.18 crown 6 2 PF6 2 VI 2 2 Bipy Pt NH3 2.dibenzo 30 crown 10 PF6 2H20 VII trans PtCl2 NH3 2.18 crown 6 n VIII P5 NH2C2H4NH2 2.18 crown 6 ê PF6 2 IX Cu NH3 4H20.18 crown 6 PF6 2 x Co NH3 6 2 18 crown 6 3 6 PF6 6 XI The compounds according to the invention facilitate the separation of transition metal complex ions in solution.Thus the separation of a particular transition metal complex ion from one or more other transition metal complex ions in solution may be effected by forming an insoluble adduct between the complex ion to be separated and a macrocyclic compound. The insoluble adduct is then separated from the solution and the adduct is treated to recover both the desired transition metal ions and the macrocyclic compound.The latter can then be recycled to react with fresh solutions containing complex ions of the desired transition metal. A particular application of the compounds of the invention involves the separation of a copper ammine complex from other metallic especially cobalt ammine complexes in solutions obtained, for example, from the ammonia leaching of carbonaceous ore deposits and ammoniacaloxidation leaching of copper sulphide concentrates. The ammonia leach solution typically comprises the copper ammine complex Cu NH3 4 H20 and the cobalt ammine complex Co NH3 6 3 and in accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, the said metal complexes are treated with a macrocyclic compound, preferably a crown ether, and especially in the presence of an anion such as a hexahalophosphate ion e.g. PF6 , to form an insoluble adduct of the copper ammine complex with the macrocyclic compound which is precipitated and a soluble adduct of the cobalt ammine complex and or other transition metal ammine complexes, if present which remains in solution. The precipitated adduct is separated from the solution and acidified to liberate copper ions and the macrocyclic compound.In a preferred separation process, the macrocyclic compound is a crown ether, and in an especially preferred process, the regenerated macrocyclic compound after acidification is an ammonium crown ether hexahalophosphate complex, e.g. NH4.18 crown 6 PF6 .Such a complex is soluble in organic solvents, e.g.methylene dichloride, thereby enabling the aqueous copper ions to be separated from the crown ether. After removal of organic solvent, e.g. by evaporation, the ammonium crown ether hexahalophosphate complex, if desired, may be recycled and used in place of the crown ether to separate copper from cobalt in fresh supplies of ammonia leach solutions. The compounds of the invention may also be used to separate precious metal complexes e.g. complexes of the platinum group metals, silver and gold .

After hour, white crystals of an adduct between Pt NH3 4 2 PF6 2 and 18 crown 6 had separated, and were filtered off yield 0.25g leaving the rhodium complex in solution. Example 9Removal of trans PtC12 NH3 2 from cis PtCl2 NH3 2 A qualitative experiment showed that addition of 18 crown6 to a dimethylformamide solution of cis Pt Cl2 NH3 2 produced no precipitated adduct. Since, as shown inExample 3, the trans isomer gives an immediate precipitate of the polymeric adduct trans PtCl2 NH3 2.18 crown 6 n the addition of 18 crown 6 to mixtures of these isomers affcrds a simple method of removing the trans isomer selectively.What we claim is
