# Ground food patty and method and apparatus for making same.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are disclosed for forming a relatively porous patty 40 of plastic food material 38 that is subject to shrinkage during cooking. One embodiment of the apparatus includes a foraminous member 640 having a plurality of apertures 642 and a piston 630 slidably disposed on a receiving chamber 610 on one side of the foreminous member 640 . A pressurizable feed chamber 54 is provided with a feed mechanism 70, 72 for feeding and pressurizing the food material 38 and forcing the material 38 through the apertures 642 and into the receiving chamber 610 . A mold 119 is provided for being aligned with the foraminous member 640 and for receiving the material 38 as it is discharged from the receiving chamber 610 by movement of the piston 630 . The discharging material impinges upon a wall 52 of the mold to form a patty 40 in which the material defines interstitial voids 310 therein for entrapping air and providing retention of cooking juices to promote more rapid and uniform cooking of the patty.
