# Assay method and kit for whole blood samples.

## Abstract
Methods and assay kits are provided for detecting the presence of a member of a specific binding pair sbp in a whole blood sample. The sbp members consist of ligand and homo logous receptor. In the method of the invention the whole blood sample, without separation of red blood cells, is combined in an aqueous buffered medium with a binding agent for the red blood cells in the sample. Where appropriate to the assay pro tocol, one or one or more members of a signal producing system, which is capable of producing a detectible signal, are included. At least one of the sbp members is substantially uniformly bound to a solid bibulous element. When the assay medium is contacted with a predetermined region of the solid bibulous element, the red blood cells will concentrate in an area on the bibulous element to the air liquid interface. Further more, the medium will traverse the solid bibulous element. The remaining members of the signal producing system are then combined with the solid bibulous element. The signal produced as a result of the binding of the sbp members is detected and is related to the amount of the sbp member in the sample.
