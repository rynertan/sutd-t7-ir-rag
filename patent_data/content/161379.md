## Description
Minigolf system with prefabricated elementsGianni Ghebbioni, Tiziano Ghebbioni ItalyThe invention concerns series of tracks which.can form a complete minigolf installation, comprising multiple layers of fiber glass compact polyurethane, or other synthetic material, put in place by casting or injection, with an uncovered or el.astomer covered slidinlf plane. It is known that minigolf installatiors are currently built by forming the various tracks on site with cement or by prefabricAting the elements with cement and then putting them in place on site.It is obvious that the cost of producing the cement tracks of either type is very high. Furthermore, trasporting the prefabricted elements is difficult due to their great weight.Moreover, the cement tracks are subject to continuous thermal variations from day to night and are exposed to atmospheric agents, with the result that they crack frequently and require continuous maintenence, if not replacement.The aim of this invention is to realize a minigolf game park with prefabricated elements which are portabLe, lightweibht, and readily assembled and disassembled.This aim is achieved with a series of elements comprising multiple layers of fiSEr glass covered on the upper outer layer with geldoat, with sliding planes either uncovered or covered with elastomers like polyurethane, synthetic rubber or the like, or even covered with carpet.The elements may also be made of compact polyurethane or other synthetic material, put in place bv casting and by injection.All the tracks, although differing in specific shapes, have a common structure comprising several homogeneoas layers of biber glass, compatt polyurethane, or other synthetic material put in place on site by casting or by injection, to form a corridor equipped at the beginning with a sheet with the starting point and along its length with various obstacles placed in the plane and above it, andconnected to the circular, triangular or polygonal arrival area, characterized by a width preferably double that of the corridor.A further characteristic of the invention consists of the fact that the tracks are put in place with preferably galvanized bolts anchors sunk duPing construction in the application base, consisting of a smooth and levelled layer of plane or sand concrete, and abbe to be inserted in suitable openings arranged as needed on the outer edges of the track hard plastic nuts are screwed onto the.bolts to allow rapid assembly of the various elements and eventual disassembly at the end of the season.Some purely exemplifying but preferred embodiments of the invention are presented in the attached drawings, which shew figure d, an asonometric cu away showing the layers forming each track figure 2, an axonihmetric view of the transverse cutaway of the corridor in every track figure 3, an axonometric explosion of a bolt anchor in place figure 4, flat and side views of various shaped possible tracks or elements.The figures show in detail the overlying layers ss of fiber glass with upper layer of gel coat 2 forming the flat sliding plane, with outlets 3 for rain water drainage, and also forming the side edges 4 of each track corridor, covered with the layer 5 of elastomer such as polyurethane, synthetic rubber or of carpet, with side openings 5A for the bolts anchors , consisting of galvanized pin P and dowel T, fixed by menas of nuts D1 and D2.Of course the edges may be formed in a different way.The several tracks of various shape indicated with the letters A, B, C, D, E, F G, H, I, L, M, N, 0, P, Q, R, S, T and schematized in figure 4 all show the corridor with starter 6, preferably made of a small alluiainum sheet with the starting point indicated, and the circular 7, or triangular 8 arrival area or any other shape , with a width preferably more than double that of the corridor with the hole at the end.In particular, according to the invention, track A presents planimetric obstacles 9 triangular in structure, track C presents cylindrical and or polygonal planimetric obstacles 0, track E has narrowings 31, track I has the diamond shaped obstacle 12, and trackO pregressively narrows telescopically 13. With regard to the obstacles,placed in the corridor in an altimetric sense, track B presents a rise with central depression 84, F has a rise with vertical Pit 15, G has the rise 16 plus the inclined arrival are 17, H has planar vertical canalization 18 in parallel to the axis of the corridor, L has swelling 19, N has a rise with descending steps 20, Q has a bulkhead as portions of cylindrical surface 21 extending upwardR has a rise with another central obstacle 22, S has an up ramp with basket 23 in the separate circular area 25, and T has the final complete ramp 26. In some structural variants of the tracks, the corridor is not aligned with the midpoint of the arrival area, as in track D with the corridor 27 in a bent line and the arrival area 28 in a spiral. In Mand P the corridor has a double right angle bend 29, and eventual intermediate obstacle 30. With regard to the ddmeneion of the tracks in the examples, these are preferably total length 2.5 8.0 m corridor width 0.30 1.20 m total width 0.60 2.50 m total height 0.05 0.70 mThe elements are relatively .lightweight because of the reduced weight of their constituent materials.Of couLee, while the principle of the finding remains the same, the forms of realization and the details of construction may be widely varied with respect to that described and illustrated here, without going beyond the bounds of the present invention.
