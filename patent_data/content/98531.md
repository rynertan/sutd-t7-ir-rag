# MOMENTARY DIGITAL ENCODING DEVICE FOR KEYBOARDS

## Abstract
An improved, low cost, high speed keyboard encoding device is provided which develops directly encoded, valid and reliable multi bit output signals and overcomes problems as sociated with tolerance errors and adverse environmental and usage conditions eg., manufacturing errors, dust, wear . The preferred encoding device includes a plurality of juxtaposed, flexible conductive strands or wires each having a number of axially spaced impact zones along the length thereof which are either insulated or electrically conductive corresponding zones on the separate wires are operably aligned to coopera tively define a series of spaced impact zone sets each made up of a unique pattern of conductive and insulated zones. An elec trically conductive, rubber like resilient pad having a series of ridge like elongated members respectively aligned with corre sponding impact zone sets is also provided which is designed for impact shifting of the members into momentary contact with the associated zone sets, whereby electrical contact is made between the ridge members and the conductive impact zones of the set. The resulting circuit making and current flow directly generates a momentary, unique, digitalized output sig nal without the need for conventional encoding electronic cir cuitry. The device is particularly suited for use in an impact type keyboard where, upon depression of each key, an asso ciated resilient element is shifted, released, and allowed to overtravel its rest position and momentarily strike the encod ing device at a location for shifting the appropriate pad ridge into contact with the adjacent impact zone set.
