# Arrangement for the transmission of audio signals.

## Abstract
An arrangement for the transmission of audio signals, comprising a delay line 1 provided with 5, 7 or 9 tappings 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 in the case of 5 tappings situated at equal time intervals along the delay line. The tappings are each con nected to a common adding circuit 16 via an amplitude control device 9 to 13 . The ratios between the amplitudes of the output signals of the amplitude control devices, viewed from one end of the delay line 1 to the other end are 1 2n 2n² 2n 1 for five tappings, 1 2n 2n² n³ n 2n² 2n 1 for seven tappings, and 1 2n 2n² n³ n 1 4 n⁴ 1 2n² n³ n 2n² 2n 1 for nine tappings. This yields an arrangement having a flat frequency response from the input 2 to the output 15 . The invention also relates to a plurality of delay lines for example 31 to 35 which are connected in series with each other. The invention also relates to a reverberation unit pro vided with an arrangement in accordance with the invention.
