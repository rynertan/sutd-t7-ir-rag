# CERAMIC CAPACITORS AND DIELECTRIC COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
A dielectric composition comprising a ternary system of non stoichiometric lead magensium niobate, non stoichiometric lead zinc niobate and non stoichiometric lead iron niobate up to 10 wt PbO may be added to the ternary mix. Compositions with firing temperatures in the range 950 to 1040 C, have dielectric constants in the range 13900 22100 making the composition particularly suitable for high silver content multi layer ceramic capacitors.
