# A THROMBOLYTIC AGENT

## Abstract
The invention discloses that the tissues of earthworms contain fibrinolytically or thrombolytically active ingredients which can be extracted and purified by a suitable sequence of extraction and purification procedures into the individual active ingredients including six novel proteases named F O HM 45, F I 1 HM 54, F I 2 HM 15, F II HM 64, F III 1 HM 27 and F III 2 HM 89. The chromatographic fractionation of the earthworm extract with an aqueous extractant gives five active fractions, the first four of which contain each one of the first mentioned four proteases and the last of which contains the last mentioned two proteases. The disclosure includes description of the suitable purification methods for the proteases as well as the physico chemical identification data thereof. Various thrombolytic medicament forms prepared with the novel proteases as the effective in gredient are described together with the results of the clini cal tests carried out by the oral administration of the novel proteases.
