In the web feed mechanism, a slackness, if any, can be absorbed by apply ing a drag to the outermost portion of the web roll 1 and by causing a biased sliding member 9, 12 to slide in the tangential directions C, D of the web roll both forward C , in which the web is to be let off from the web roll, and backward D , in which the web is to be taken up onto the web roll.
