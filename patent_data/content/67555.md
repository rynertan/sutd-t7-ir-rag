# APPARATUS FOR RESTORING THE LIGHT TRANSMITTANCE OF AN IMAGE TRANSMITTING OPTICAL FIBER BUNDLE USED IN FIBEROPTIC ENDOSCOPE

## Abstract
When a fiberoptic endoscope is exposed to X ray or Î³ ray irradiation, the fiber bundle becomes discolored and there is thus a reduction in light transmittance. This makes observation or examination difficult or impossible. The irradiation induced reduction in light transmittance of the image transmitting fiber bundle is restored by visible light radiation. The image transmitting fiber bundle at either end is exposed to visible light radiation which is conducted from a light source by a light transmitting means using an attachment which is fitted when restoration is required.
