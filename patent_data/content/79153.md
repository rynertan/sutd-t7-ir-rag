# Controlling register in a printing press.

## Abstract
For register control when printing on a web, signals corresponding to a predetermined hidden pattern of low amplitude density variations are superimposed on picture signals representing the image to be printed. After printing, light from elements of the printed image, with its hidden pattern, is detected by a register scanning head and the variations are correlated in a signal processor with the known variations of portions of the predetermined hidden pattern. In this way a position error signal is derived and can be used to correct the web position.
