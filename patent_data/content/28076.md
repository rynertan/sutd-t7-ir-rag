# Process for producing propylene ethylene block copolymers.

## Abstract
A propylene ethylene block copolymer is produced in the presence of a catalytic system essentially comprising an orga noaluminum compound and a solid titanium trichloride catalyt ic complex having an atomic ratio of Al to Ti of less than 0.15 and having a comlexing agent in two stages of polymerization a a first stage wherein propylene is polymerised in the presence of liquid propylene and hydrogen to produce a propy lene homopolymer having a melt flow index of 1 to 150 at a ratio of 70 to 95 by weight based on a total of polymers and b a second stage copolymerized wherein the polypropy lene from stage a is with propylene and ethylene in the pres ence of hydrogen and liquid propylene at a concentration of propylene in the vapor phase, based on the total of propylene and ethylene in the vapor phase, of 50 to 85 mol. and at a concentration of hydrogen in the vapor phase, based on the total of propylene and ethylene in the vapor phase, of 0.5 to 30 mol. to produce an ethylene propylene copolymer having a melt flow index of 10 ‚Å∑ to 0.1 at a ratio of 5 to 30 by weight based on the total polymers.
