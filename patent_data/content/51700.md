# Woodworking technique for forming corners.

## Abstract
A woodworking technique for creating an angled corner in a straight wood piece. Formed on the inner side of the piece is a cut out that is symmetrical with respect to a transverse reference line, the cut out being constituted by a converging entry zone whose opposing flat sides 11A, 11B have complementary angles each equal to one half of the corner angle, the entry zone leading into an oblong interior zone whose opposing arcuate sides 12A, 12B follow the curvature of a pair of circles CA, CB . The wood bridge joining the arcuate sides 12A, 12B of the interior zone is steamed to permit bending thereof to cause the arcuate sides 12A, 12B to meet and the flat sides 11A, 11B to abut on the reference line, thereby defining a circular socket 15 for receiving a leg or other furniture component.
