# Process for the production of heterogeneous articles.

## Abstract
A process for the production of heterogeneous articles such as heterofilaments and fibres containing a plurality of solid phases, comprises supplying a thermoplastic first mat erial in particulate solid form to a surface of rotation of a rotating body so that it travels across said surface towards a discharge zone due to forces generated by the rotation of the body, melting the thermoplastic first material as it travels across the surface, supplying a second solid material to the surface, discharging both materials together from the dis charge zone by centrifugal forces, and solidifying the thermo plastic material to form the heterogeneous article. The second material is preferably also thermoplastic and further solids, especially reinforcing fibres, can also be incorporated like wise.
