# Optical fiber cables having improved hermeticity.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process and apparatus for fabricating optical fiber cables 11 having improved hermeticity. The optical fiber cables are formed by reducing the water content of the buffer material 12 surrounding each optical fiber 14 , for example by heating in an oven 16 , and thereafter encapsulating the dried optical fiber s in a metal or metal alloy tube 18 . After fiber encapsulation, the tube may be sealed to prevent the ingress of moisture and or water from the surrounding environment.
