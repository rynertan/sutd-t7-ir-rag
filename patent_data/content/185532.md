# A CONSTRAINING MOUNT SYSTEM FOR SURFACE ACOUSTIC WAVE DEVICES

## Abstract
Apparatus is provided for mounting an electronic com ponent having a pressure sensitive active area, which permits the component to expand and contract with changes in temperature and which does not introduce stresses into the active area of the component. The apparatus includes a cradle which, when attached to a substrate forms a partial enclosure of the component but which leaves the active area unobscured. A packaging system is also provided wherein the bottom of the cavity of the lower portion of a standard integrated circuit package forms the substrate to be used in conjunction with the cradle for containing the electronic component.
