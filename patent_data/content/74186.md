## Description
CURRENT LIMITING DEVICE This invention relates to a current limiting device employing a current limiting element including a current limiting material put in the form of a solid or a liquid at a normal current therethrough, and responsive to t an overcurrent flowing therethrough which is in excess of a predetermined magnitude to be vaporized due to Joules heat generated thereon to exhibit a high resistance thereby to limit the overcurrent while, upon restoring the normal current due to the disappearance of the overcurrent, the vaporized current limiting material is solidified or liquefied into a good electrical conductor. The current limiting element of the type referred to might have a fundamental structure such as disclosed inJapanese utility model publication No. 11798 1978 and a concrete structure such as disclosed in Japanese patent publication No. 5540 1974. The current limiting element as disclosed inJapanese patent publication No. 5540 1974 has comprised a first electrode cylinder and an electrically insulating cylinder connected in longitudinally aligned relationship to each other. After having been surrounded by an electrically insulating member, the two connected cylinders have been fitted into a second electrode cylinder from one end thereof and included connected aligned central holes communicating with a central hole which is disposed within the second electrode cylinder and terminates at a pressure buffering cylinder fitted into the second electrode cylinder from the other end thereof.All the holes are filled with an amount of the current limiting material as described above, for example, an alkali metal such as sodium or potassium and the pressure buffering cylinder has included a piston pushed by an inert gas such as argon charged in the same. Upon the occurrence of an overcurrent, the current limiting material has been operated to limit the overcurrent as described above while a high vapor pressure developed at that time is operated to move the piston and buffered with the argon. After the current limitation, a circuit interrupter connected in series to the current limiting element has interrupted the limited current to leave the current.limiting material to be cooled resulting in its original solid or liquid state. It has been already known to connect the current limiting element of the type referred across an impedance element in order to decrease electrical energy applied to that element under the current limitation and suppress the resulting switching voltage. Then the parallel combination of the current limiting and impedance elements has been connected to a plurality of parallel branches each including a circuit interrupter and a load. Upon the occurrence of a fault on any one of the branches, the current limiting element limits first the overcurrent and then that circuit interrupter disposed on the failed branch is open to disconnect the failed branch from the remaining sound branches while both a follow current flowing through the current limiting element and a current flowing through the parallel impedance element flow through the sound branches. At that time after the current limiting element has limited the overcurrent, the electrically insulating cylinder disposed therein continues to be exposed to a plasma at an elevated temperature resulting from the vaporized current limiting material until the current interrupter in the failed branch interrupts the limited overcurrent. Thus the electrically insulating cylinder might damage. This has meant a decrease in the number of the current limiting operations enabled by the current limiting element and therefore in its lifetime. Also since the parallel impedance element has had a magnitude as determined in view of a decrease in electrical energy developed during the particular current limitation, that magnitude has been unable to change at will. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved current limiting device including a current limiting element of the type referred to an having a prolonged lifetime while being capable of changing a current after the current limitation as will. The present invention provides a current limiting device comprising a current limiting element responsive to a flow of overcurrent therethrough to rapidly increase in electric resistance to limit the overcurrent and also responsive to the restoration to a normal current flowing therethrough to be restored to a good electrical conductor, a switching element connected in series to the current limiting element to be open in interlock with the operation of the current limiting element, the switching element being automatically closed after the opening thereof, and an impedance element connected across the series combination of the current limiting element and the switching element. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the current limiting device may comprise an impedance element connected across the current limiting element, a current detector for detecting a change in current flowing through the impedance element when the current limiting element responds to the flow of overcurrent therethrough to exhibit a high electric resistance, and energizing means responsive to an output from the current detector to open the switching element. tn order to automatically close the switching element in its open position, delay means may be connected to the current detector to time out a predetermined delay time immediately after the opening of the switching element, and energizing means connected to the delay means to close the switching element in response to the lapse of the predetermined delay time.Alternatively a current detector may be coupled to the switching means to close the switching means through energizing means in response to the disappearance of the limited overcurrent from the switching means The present invention will become more readily apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a longitudinal sectional view of a conventional current limiting element Figure 2 is a circuit diagram of Ar. impedance element connected across the current limiting element shown in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a circuit diagram illustrating a circuit with which the current limiting element shown in The 1 is used Figure 4 is a circuit diagram of one embodiment according to the current limiting device of the present invention Figure 5 is a graph illustrating waveforms of currents flowing through various points in the arrangement shown in Figure 4 and useful in explaining the operation of the present invention Figure 6 is a diagram similar to Figure 4 but illustrated a modification of the present invention and Figure 7 is a diagram similar to Figure 4 but illustrating another modification of the present invention. Throughout the Figures like reference numerals designate the identical or corresponding components. oo Referring now to Figure 1 of the drawings, there is illustrated a conventional current limiting element of the type described above. The arrangement illustrated comprises a first electrode cylinder 10 of suitable electrically conductive metallic material such as copper or brass including one end portion in the form of a threaded terminal 10a, an intermediate portion in the form of a flange and the other end portion terminating at a flat end surface perpendicular to the logitcdinal axis thereof. The t first electrode cylinder 10 has a longitudinal cylindrical hole lOb extending therethrough along the longitudinal axis except for the one end portion through which a thread hole lOc extends.That portion of the longitudinal hole lOb adjacent to the threaded terminal lOa is somewhat smaller in diameter than the remaining portion thereof and communicates with the threaded hole lOc, but a sealing element 12 formed, for example, of a needle valve is screw threaded into the threaded hole lOc to normally hermetically close the end of the smaller portion of the, longitudinal hole lOb. Then the first electrode cylinder 10 is connected on the other end surface to an electrically insulating cylinder 14 equal in diameter to the other end portion thereof and coaxial with the same. The electrically insulating cylinder 14 includes a longitudinal cylindrical hole 14a equal in diameter to and aligned with the larger diameter portion of the longitudinal hole lOb and is formed of an electrically insulating material excellent in heat and alkali resistances, for example, beryllia. The connected first electrode cylinder 10 and electrically insulating cylinder 14 except for the threaded terminal lOa are surrounded in intimate contact relationship by an electrically insulating member of a circular cross section complementary in shape thereto by having both ends surface flush with that surface of the first electrode cylinder 10 from which the threaded terminal 10a extends axially and the free end surface of the electrically insulating member 14 respectively and perpendicular to the common longitudinal axis of the two cylinders 10 and 14. The electrically insulating member 16 is preferably formed of an electrically insulating material prepared by sintering a mixture of pulverized mica, a pulverized glass and a binder therefor. Subsequently, the electrically insulating member 16 with the cylinders 10 and 14 is firmly fitted into a central cylindrical opening longitudinally extending through a second electrode cylinder 18 to leave that end portion of the member 16 adjacent to the threaded terminal lOa to be exposed. Thus the first electrode cylinder 10 is disposed to be opposite to the second electrode cylinder 18 through the electrically insulating cylinder and member 14 and 16 respectively. The second electrode cylinder 18 includes further a stepwise flared cylindrical hole 18a coaxial and communicating with the central cylindrical opening 14a in the electrically insulating member 14 and terminating at a longitudinal cylindrical opening extending through the remaining portion of the second electrode cylinder 10 to be coaxial with the aligned longitudinal holes 10a and 14a and opening on that end surface thereof remote from the first electrode cylinder 10.The flaired cylindrical hole 18a has that portion thereof adjacent to the central cylindrical opening 14a in the electrically insulating member 14 equal in diameter to and communicating with the latter and the last mentioned longitudinal cylindrical opening has its inner periphery threaded except for that end portion thereof adjacent to the flared hole 18a to form a threaded opening 18b into which a pressure buffering cylinder 20 is screw threaded with a gasket 22 interposed therebetween to seal the flared hole 18a and the interior of the cylinder 20 from the exterior thereof. The pressure buffering cylinder 20 is formed of any suitable metallic material and includes a longitudinal cylindrical hole 20a with a relatively large diameter, a narrow hole 205 and a threaded hole 20e extending therethrough in the named order to be coaxial with the cylinder 20 and with one another and connected to one another. Then a piston 24 is slidably disposed in the large diameter holes 20a through a piston ring or an O ring 26.The pressure buffering cylinder 20 is also provided on the substantial part of the outer periphery with a threaded portion 20d. With the pressure buffer cylinder 20 fitted into the second electrode cylinder 18 by having an outer threaded periphery 20d thereof screw threaded into the threaded hole 18b in the latter cylinder 18, the holes 20a, 20b and 20c are coaxial with the holes lOb and 14a in the first electrode cylinder 10 and the electrically insulating cylinder 14 and the flared hole 18a in the second electrode cylinder 18 while the hole 20a is connected to the flared hole 18a and that end portion of the buffer cylinder 20 remote from the first electrode cylinder 10 extends from the second electrode cylinder 18 to form a mounting terminal. Further disposed within the threaded hole 20c opening at the protruding end of the pressure buffer cylinder 20 is a sealing element 28 formed, for example, of a needle valve by screw threading the same into the threaded hole 20c to normally hermetically close the narrow hole 20b. In order to render the mechanical connection of the first to the second electrode cylinder 10 and 18 respectively stronger, an outer cylindrical metallic shell 30 is fitted onto the exposed portion of the electrically insulating member 16 with the adjacent end portion of the second electrode cylinder 18 screw threaded into a free end portion of the shell 30. The aligned holes lOb, 14a, 18a and that portion of the hole 20a disposed between the flared hole 18a and the piston 24 are charged with an amount of a current limiting material 32 as described above such as an alkali metal for example, sodium or potassium and that portion of the hole 20a disposed between the piston 24 and the sealing element 28 is charged with an amount of an inert gas 34 such as argon serving as a pressure buffering gas. The arrangement as described above in conjunction with Figure 1 is generally designated by the reference numeral 36. Upon the occurrence of an overcurrent flowing through the arrangement of Figure 1, at least one part of the current limiting material 32 is vaporized to form a plasma at an elevated temperature which, in turn, presents a high resistance before the overcurrent to limit the latter to not higher than a predetermined magnitude. At that time a high vapor pressure is generated but it moves the piston 24 toward the sealing element 28 thereby to be buffered.After the limitation of the overcurrent, a circuit voltage is developed across both ends of the electrically insulating cylinder 14 or the first and second electrode cylinders 10 and 18 respectively but the electrically insulating member 16 can sufficiently withstand that circuit voltage. After having been limited by the arrangement of Figure 1, the overcurrent is interrupted by a circuit interrupter not shown serially connected to that arrangement. After the interruption of the overcurrent, the vaporized current limiting material 32 is cooled to be solidified or liquefied due to a back pressure exhibited by the pressure buffering gas 34 resulting in the return back to its original normal state. As illustrated in Figure 2, the current limiting element 36 shown in Figure 1 is generally connected across an impedante element such as a resistor or a reactor for the purpose of decreasing electrical energy applied to the current limiting element being limiting the particular overcurrent and suppressing a switching voltage across the element. This measure is disclosed, for example, inJapanese patent publication No. 18193 1975. The current limiting element as described above are frequently used with electric systems called control or power centers such as shown in Figure 3. Such a system is disclosed in Japanese utility model publication No.24651 1974 which will be subsequently outlined in conjunction with Figure 3. In the arrangement illustrated in Figure 3 the current limiting element 36 is connected across the impedance element 38 and also in the main line which is, in turn, divided into a multitude of branches, in this case, four branches, each including a subordinate circuit interrupter 40a, 40b, 40c or 40d and a load 42a, 42b, 42c or 42d serially connected thereto. Assuming that a shortcircuit has occurred at a point A in that branch including the circuit interrupter 40a and the load 42a, the current limiting element 36 is immediately operated to limit the resulting shortcircuiting current to protect the associated circuit interrupter 40a. Then some time goes by until the circuit interrupter 40a is operated to interrupt the limited shortcircuiting current.Under these circumstances, both a follow current through the current limiting element 36 and a current flowing through the parallel impedance element 38 are supplied to the remaining branches resulting in a power supply system capable of disconnecting the failed circuit from the system without a suspension of the power supply and therefore high in reliability. Also since each of the circuit interrupters 40a through 40d is required only to interrupt a current limited by the current limiting element 36, the circuit interrupter can decrease in interrupting capacity resulting in an economical power supply system. In the arrangement of Figure 3, however, the current limiting element 36 has a limited fault current continuing to flow therethrough until any one of the subordinate circuit interrupters 40a, 40b, 40c or 40d is operated to disconnect the failed branch from the system. Meanwhile the current limiting material 32 in the current limiting element 36 is in the form of a plasma having a temperature of several thousand degrees C. This plasma at such an elevated temperature has damage the structural components of the current limiting element 36 and particularly the electrically insulating member 14 exposed to the same resulting in a problem or a decrease in the number of current limiting operations enabled by the current limiting element and therefore the useful lifetime thereof.In addition, a current through the system after the current limitation is determined by both a follow current flowing through the current limiting element 36 and that flowing through the parallel impedance element 38. As described in the above cited Japanese patent publication No. 18193 1975, the parallel impedance element 38 has its magnitude as determined in view of a decrease in electric energy developed on the current limiting element during the current limitation. This has resulted in another problem that the magnitude of the parallel impedance element can not vary at will. The present invention contemplates to solve the problems of the prior art practice as described above by the provision of an impedance element connected across a series a U u j combination of the current limiting element as described and an associated switching element. Referring now to Figure 4, there is illustrated one embodiment according to the current limiting device of the present invention. The arrangement illustrated comprises the current limiting element 36 as described above in conjunction with Figure 1 a switching element 44 connected in series thereto and a current limiting impedance element 46 connected across the serially connected current limiting and switching elements 36 and 44 respectively. The current limiting impedance element 46 may be a resistor or a reactor.The current limiting element 36 is also connected across a series combination of the impedance element 38 as described above in conjunction in Figure 2 and a current transformer 48 and the switching element 44 includes a trip coil 44a for opening the same upon the energization thereof and a closing coil 44b for closing it upon the energization thereof. The current transformer 48 includes a secondary winding connected to a current detector 50 which is, in turn, connected directly to the trip coil 44a and also via a delay element 52 to the closing coil 44b. The current detector 50 receives an output current from the current transformer 48 transformed from a current flowing the parallel impedance element 38 to detect the lastmentioned current thereby to produce an output which, in turn, energizes the trip coil 44a of the switching element 44 to open the switching element 44. The delay element 52 is operative to time out a predetermined delay time immediately after the current detector 50 has produced the output for opening the switch element 44 and upon the timing out of that delay time produce an output for energizing the closing coil 44b of the switching element 44 in order to close the switching element 44. It is assumed that the switching element 44 is connected to the multitude of parallel branches shown inFigure 3. The operation of the arrangement shown in Figure 4 will now be described in connection with Figure 5 wherein there is illustrated current waveforms developed at various points in the arrangement. Since the current limiting and switching elements 36 and 44 respectively have individual impedances less than those of the parallel and current limiting impedance elements 38 and 46 respectively, most of a normal current flows through the former elements 36 and 38 as shown at current waveforms I1 and 12 flowing through the current limiting and parallel impedance elements 36 and 38 respectively in Figure 5. It is assumed that in the arrangement of Figure 3 a fault has occurred at a point A in the branch including the circuit interrupter 40a and the load 42a resulting in a flow of an overcurrent as shown at a current waveform 12 flowing through the system in Figure 5 at a time point a illustrated in the same Figure, the current limiting material 32 disposed in the current limiting element 36 is vaporized to present a high resistance before the overcurrent to permit shunt currents to flows through the parallel and current limiting impedance elements 38 and 46 respectively as shown at the current waveform 12 and a current waveform 13 flowing through the current limiting impedance element 46 in Figure 5.Then the current detector 50 detect the shunt current flowing through the current limiting impedance element 46 through the current transformer 48 to energize the trip coil 44a of the switching element 44. This results in the opening of the switching element 44 at a time point b as shown in Figure 5. Then at a time point c shown in Figure 5, a subordinate current interrupter, in this case, that shown by 40a in Figure 3 is operated to disconnect a failed branch from the system as described above in conjunction withFigure 3. Also in parallel with the operation of the current detector 50 as described above, the delay element 2 receives the output from the current detector 52 to time out the predetermined delay time and to energize the closing coil 44b of the switching element 44 on the completion of that timing out. This results in the closure of the switching element 44 at a time point d shown in Figure 5. Thus the arrangement of Figure 4 is restored to its original state to be ready for the next succeeding operation. Also the circuit interrupter 40a can be put in is closed position after the fault at the point A has been removed. In Figure 4, a dotted line extended from current waveform IT designates the overcurrent.developed in the absence of the current limiting device. From the foregoing it will readily be understood that with the arrangement of Figure 4 substituted for parallel combination of the current limiting and parallel impedance elements 36 and 38 respectively in the arrangement shown in Figure 3, for example, the circuit interrupter 40a can interrupt a failure current limited by the current limiting element 36 during the delay time as described above. In Figure 6, there is illustrated a modification of the present invention in which there is detected a current flowing through the main circuit including the current limiting and switching elements and the restoring operation is automatically performed when the particular overcurrent becomes null. The arrangement illustrated is different from that shown in Figure 4 only in that in Figure 6, a separate current transformer 54 is connected in series to the switching element 44 and includes a secondary winding connected via a separate current detector 56 to the closing coil 44b of the switching element 44 with the delay element 52 omitted. The separate current detector 56 is operative to detect a null magnitude of the principal current flowing through the current limiting and switching elements 36 and 44 respectively by means of the separate current transformer 54 to supply an output to the closing coil 44b of the switching element 44. As in the arrangement of Figure 4, the occurrence an overcurrent causes first the current limiting element 36 to be operated and then the switching element 44 to be put in its open position. Following this, for example, the subordinate circuit interrupter 40a see Figure 3 is operated to disconnect the particular failed branch from the system resulting in the disappearance of the overcurrent.The separate current detector 56 detects this disappearance of the overcurrent through the separate current transformer 54 to energize the closing coil 44b to put the switching element 44 in its closed position. At that time the arrangement of Figure 6 is restored to its original state to be ready for the next succeeding operation. As in the arrangement of Figure 4, the opened subordinate circuit interrupter such as shown by 40a in Figure 3 can be closed after the removal of the fault. Figure 7 shows another modification of the present invention including means for detecting the operation of the current limiting element different from that included in the arrangement shown in Figure 4 or 6. In the arrangement illustrated, an indicator rod 58 is connected to the piston 24 in the pressure buffering cylinder 20 see Figure 1 and extended outside of the current limiting element 36. Then the indicator rod 58 is provided at the end disposed outside of the element 36 with a pair of movable indicator contacts 60m arranged to be separably engaged by opposite stationary indicator contacts 60s.One of the stationary contacts 60s is connected to one end of the trip coil 44a of the switching element 44 through a control source 62 shown in Figure 7 as comprising a DC source and the other stationary contact 60s is connected to the other end of the trip coil 44b through a lead not shown . When the current limiting element 36 is operated to move the piston 24, and therefore the indicator rod 58, the movable indicator contacts 60m are engaged by the associated stationary contacts 60s to permit the trip coil 44a to be energized from the control source 62 resulting in the opening of the switching element 44. Thus the indicator rod 58 and therefore the set of indicator contacts 60m 60s can be operated with a delay time scarcely exhibited with respect of the operation of the current limiting element 36. Japanese utility model publication No. 12512 1969 discloses the measure to detect the operation of the current limiting element 36 with the closure of the indicator contact set 60m 60s due to the movement of the indicator rod 58 for the current limiting element 36 as described above in conjunction with Figure 7. From the foregoing i is seen that, according to the present invention, current limiting element can limit an overcurrent to open the switching element serially connected to the same to interrupt a follow current while a current is turned to flow through a current limiting impedance element connected across the current limiting element. This measure can cause a time interval for which an overcurrent can flow through the current limiting element to be extremely short resulting into a reduction in damage to the structural components of the current limiting element and particularly the electrically insulating member 14. This can increase the number of the current limiting operations enabled by the current limiting element and therefore its lifetime.Also, since a current after the current limitation is determined by a magnitude of the current limiting impedance element, the same can change at will by varying the magnitude of the current limiting impedance element. Further the arrangement of Figure 6 is advantageous over that shown in Figure 4 in that the former can be restored to its original state within a short time interval as compared with the latter because the current detector 56 detects the disappearance of an overcurrent. Also the arrangement of Figure 7 is advantageous in a further increase in the number of the current limiting operations enabled by the current limiting element and therefore in its lifetime. This is because the operation of the indicator rod 58 and therefore the set of indicator contacts 60 60s can be performed with a delay time scarcely exhibited with respect to the operation of the current limiting element 36 to permit the switching element 44 connected in series to the current limiting element to be open extremely fast following the operation of the current limiting element 36. While the present invention has been illustrated and described in conjunction with a few preferred embodiments thereof it is to be understood that numerous changes and modifications may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, the parallel impedance element 38 in the arrangement of Figure 4 may be omitted so long as the current limiting impedance element 46 has a magnitude meeting the requirements set forth in the above citedJapanese patent application No. 18198 1975.At that time, however, it is required to connect the current transformer 48 in series to the current limiting impedance el8QhZ 41.8 6 Although the arrangement of Figure 6 is operative to detect the disappearance of an overcurrent due to the operation of an associated subordinate circuit interrupter for example, the circuit interrupter 40a shown in Figure 3 through the detection of a current flowing through the main circuit, a signal for the opening of that subordinate circuit interrupter may be directly applied to the closing coil 44b of the switching element 44 to close the element 44. Furthermore, in the arrangement of Figure 7 a thrust force provided by the indicator rod 58 may be utilized to open the switching element 44 directly in interlock with the operation of the current limiting element 36 as disclosed in any of Japanese patent publication Nos. 25580 1973, 943 1974 and 2150 1974. In addition, the current limiting element 36 may be constructed to be integral with the switching element 44 whereby an operating force provided by the piston 24 is utilized to directly operate the switching element 44 as disclosed in Japanese patent publication No. 7932 1974.
