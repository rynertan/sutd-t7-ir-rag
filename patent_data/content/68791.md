# Electron beam control device for electron microscopes.

## Abstract
An electron beam control device for electron micro scopes is disclosed in which various digital signals used for deflecting an electron beam are previously stored in a memory 21 for each observation mode. When one of the observation modes is specified by a selector 22 , one of the digital signals corresponding to the specified observation mode is read out from the memory to a digital to analog converter 29H, 29T and is thereby converted into an analog signal. The analog signal is supplied to electron beam deflectors 11, 13 to control the beam alignment.
