# Thermoplastic resin compositions containing a filler and artifacts formed therefrom.

## Abstract
Thermoplastic resin, for example polyvinyl chloride, especially unplasticized PVC, or a thermoplastic elastomer, contains, as a filler, a particulate amorphous silica that has been obtained by the vapour phase oxidation of silica and or the sublimation and subsequent condensation of silica. A preferred silica is obtained as by product in the production of silicon metal or ferro silicon in a reduction furnace. The filler can be used at loadings as high as 250, preferably up to 150, parts per hundred parts of resin. Artifacts formed from the compositions include pipes, conduits, gutters and soles for footwear.
