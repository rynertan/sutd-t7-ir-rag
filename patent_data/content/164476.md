The polycarbonates are generally prepared by the co reaction of a dihydric phenol such as bisphenol A with a carbonate precursor such as phosgene. While presently available conventional polycarbonates are quite useful in a wide range of applications there nevertheless exists a need, especially in applications involving high temp erature environements, for polycarbonates exhibit ing greater heat resistance than that possessed by conventional polycarbonates. It is therefore, an object of the instant invention to provide polycarbonates which exhibit improved heat resistance.

The phenol of Formula V is reacted with the ketone of Formula IV under conditions of temperature and pressure, and in the presence of the acid catalyst, such that coreaction between said phenol and said ketone will occur to form the dihydric phenol of Formula I. Generally, the reaction proceeds satisfactorily at about one atmosphere of pressure and at temperatures of from about room temperature 25 C to about 100 C. The amount of the acid catalyst employed is a catalytic amount. By catalytic amount is meant an amount effective to catalyze the reaction between the ketone and the phenol to produce the dihydric phenol.Generally. this amount is in the range of from about 0.1 to about 10 percent. However, in actual practice it is usually somewhat higher since the water coproduct formed in thereaction dilutes the acid catalyst and renders it somewhat less effective slowing the reaction than in its undiluted state. In the preparation of the carbonate polymers of the instant invention only one dihydric phenol of Formula I may be employed, or a mixture of two or more different dihydric phenols of Formula I may be used. The carbonate precursor that is reacted with the dihydric phenol of Formula I may be a carbonyl halide, a diaryl carbonate, or a bishaloformate. The preferred carbonate precursors are the carbonyl halides. The carbonyl halides are selected from carbonyl chloride, carbonyl bromide, and mixtures thereof. The preferred carbonyl halide is carbonyl chloride, also known as phosgene. The novel linear carbonate polymers of the instant invention contain at least one repeating strutural unit represented by the general formulaEMI17.1 wherein X, R1 and m are as defined hereinafore, andR is independently selected from lower alkyl radicals and n is two. In order for the polycarbonates of the instant invention to exhibit particularly high heat resist andes it is critical that each n be two, i.e., that the polycarbonates be tetra alkyl substituted polycarbonates. Thus, for example, if both n s are one, the dialkyl substituted polycarbonate exhibits inferior heat resistance as compared with a tetra alkyl substituted polycarbonate. Likewise, if one n is zero, and the other n is one, the mono alkyl substituted polycarbonate likewise exhibits a heat resistance which is inferior than that of a comparable tetra alkyl substituted polycarbonate. It is likewise important that R in Formula II be selected from a lower alkyl radical. These high molecular weight aromatic carbonate polymers generally have a number average molecular weight in the range of from about 5,000 to about 200,000, preferably in the range of from about 10,000 to about 100,000. Also included herein are the thermoplastic randomly branched polycarbonates. These randomly branched polycarbonates may be prepared by coreacting i a carbonate precursor, ii at least one dihydric phenol of Formula I, and iii a minor amount of a polyfunctional organic compound. The polyfunctional organic compound is generally aromatic in nature and functions as a branching agent. This polyfunctional aromatic compound contains at least three functional groups selected from hydroxyl, carboxyl, haloformyl, carboxylic anhydride, and the like. Some typical polyfunctional aromatic compounds are disclosed in B.S. Patent Mods. 3,635,895 and 4,001,184, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.Some illustrative non limiting examples of these poly functional aromatic compounds include trimellitic anhydride, trimellitic acid, trimellityl trichloride, mellitic acid, and the like. One method of preparing the high molecular weight aromatic carbonate polymers of the instant invention involves the heterogeneous inter facial polymerization system utilizing an aqueous caustic solution, an organic water immiscible solvent such as methylene chloride, at least one dihydric phenol represented by the general Formula I, a carbonate precursor such as phosgene, a catalyst, and a molecular weight regulator. Another useful method for preparing the linear carbonate polymer of the instant invention involves the use of an organic solvent system, such as pyridine, wherein said organic solvent system may also function as an acid acceptor, at least one dihydric phenol represented by Formula I, a molecular weight regulator, a catalyst, and a carbonate precursor such as phosgene. The catalysts which are employed herein can be any of the suitable catalysts that aid the polymerization reaction of a dihydric phenol with a carbonate precursor such as phosgene to produce a polycarbonate. Suitable catalysts include, but are not limited to, tertiary amines such as triethylamine, quaternary ammonium compounds, and quaternary phosphonium compounds. The molecular weight regulators employed can be any of the known compounds which regulate the molecular weight of the carbonate polymer by a chain terminating mechanis. These compounds include, but are not limited to, phenol, tertiary butyl phenol, chromanI, and the like. The temperature at which the phosgenation reaction proceeds may vary from below O C to above 100 C. The reaction proceeds satisfactorily at temperatures from room temperature 25rOC to about 50 C, Since the reaction is exothermic, the rate of phosgene addition or the use of a low boiling solvent such as methylene chloride may be used to control the reaction temperature. The carbonate polymers of the instant invention may optionally have admixed therewith certain commonly known and used additives such as antioxidants antistatic agents fillers such as glass fibers, mica, talc, clay, and the like impact modifiers ultraviolet radiation absorbers such as the benzophenones, benzotriazoles, cyanoacrylates, and the like plasticizers hydrolytic stabilizers such as the epoxides disclosed in U.S.Patent Nos. 3,489,716, 4,138,379 and 3,839,247, all of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference color stabilizers such as the organophosphites disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,305, 520 and 4,118,730, both of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference flame retardants and the like.

Generally, any material known to impact modify aromatic polycarbonates should be useful in upgrading the impact properties of the polycarbonates of this invention. Examples of these impact modifiers include but are not limited to the following general categories polyacrylates polyolefins rubbery dienic polymers and styrenic polymers. The polyacrylates which may be employed as impact modifiers are rubbery homopolymers or copolymers. In general the polyalkyl acrylates described in Brinkman et al., United States Patent 3,591,659, incorporated herein by reference, can be used, especially those containing units derived from alkyl acrylates, particularly n butyl acrylate. Acrylate containing copolymers wherein the other monomer is, for example, derived from a methacrylate are also readily employable, see for example Japanese Patent Application Announcement 1968 18611, incorporated herein by reference.Preferably the acrylate resin will be in the form of a rubber elastic.graft copolymer having a glass trans ilion temperature below about 20 C, preferably below about 40 C. Schlichting, United States Patent 4,022,748, incorporated herein by reference. More preferably, the acrylate resin will comprise a multiple stage polymer having a rubbery first stage core and a thermoplastic hard final stage shell , see Farnham United States Patent 4,096,202, incorporated herein by reference. The most preferred acrylate resin is X multiphase composite interpolymer comprised of a C1 C5 acrylate and a C15 methacrylate. These interpolymers consist of about 25 to 95 weight percent of a first elastomeric phase polymerized from a monomer system comprising about 75 to 99.8 weight percent of a C15 alkyl acrylate, 0.1 to 5 percent by weight cross linking monomer, 0.1 to 5 percent by weight of graftlinking monomer, and about 75 to 5 weight percent of a final rigid thermoplastic phase polymerized in the presence of said elastomeric phase.

Suitable crosslinking monomers include polyacrylic and polymethacrylic esters of polyols such as butylene diacrylate and dimethacrylate, trimethylol propane trimethacrylate, and the like di and trivinyl benzene, vinyl acrylate and methacrylate, and the like. The preferred crosslinking monomer is butylene diacrylate. The graftlinking monomer is a polyethylenically unsaturated monomer having a plurality of addition polymerizable reactive groups, at least one of which polymerizes at substantially different rates of polymerization from at least one other of said reactive groups. The function of the graftlinking monomer is to provide a residual level of unsaturation in the elastomeric phase, particularly in the latter stages of polymerization and, consequently, at or near the surface of the elastomer particles. When the rigid thermoplastic phase is subsequently polymerized at the surface of the elastomer, the residual unsaturated addition polymerizable reactive group contributed by the graftlinking monomer participates in the subsequent reaction so that at least a portion of the rigid phase is chemically attached to the surface of the elastomer. Among the effective graftlinking monomers are alkyl groupcontaining monomers of alkyl esters of ethylenically unsaturated acids such as allyl acrylate, allyl methacrylate, diallyl maleate, diallyl fumarate, and allyl acid itaconate. Somewhat less preferred are the diallyl esters of polycarboxylic acids which do not contain polymerizable unsaturation. The preferred graft linking monomers are allyl methacrylate and dially maleate. A most.preferred interpolymer has only two stages, the first stage comprising about 60 to 95 percent by weight of the interpolymer and being polymerized from a monomer system comprising 95 to 99.8 percent by weight butyl acrylate, 0.1 to 2.5 percent by weight butylene diacrylate as crosslinking agent, 0.1 to 2.5 percent by weight allyl methacrylate or diallyl maleate as a graftlinking agent, with a final stage polymerized from about 60 to 100 percent by weight methyl methacryiate. The multiphase composite interpolymer Acryloid EM 330 available from Rohm and Haas is preferred. This interpolymer is comprised of small quantities of cross linking and graft monomers, about 80 weight percent n butyl acrylate and about 20 weight percent methyl methacrylate. The polyolefins which can be employed as impact modifiers are homopolymers or copolymers.Examples of the homopolymers include polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutene l, polyhexene and the like.The polymers include the standard high density polymers, low density polymers as well as the new linear low density polyolefins such as the linear low density polyethylene made with butene l or octene l.Other examples of copolymers containing at least one olefin mononer can be employed. For example, copolymers of ethylene and propylene can be employed as the impact modifier as well as a copolymer of an olefin and an acrylate such as ethylene ethyl acrylate, a copolymer available from Union Carbide as DPD 6169.Other higher alevin monomers can be employed as tapolymers with alkyl acrylates, for example propylene and n butyl acrylate and the like. These polyolefin polymers can also be reacted with rubbery dienes so as to form terpolymers of the EPDM family such as ethylene propylene diene terpolymers, for exampleEpsyn 704 available from Copolymer Rubber. Various rubbery polymers can also be employed as impact modifiers. Examples of such rubbery polymers include polybutadiene, polyisoprene, styrene butadiene and various other copolymers having a rubbery dienic comonomer. Styrene containing polymers can also be employed as impact modifiers. Examples of such polymers include acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, styrene acrylonitrile, acrylonitrile butadiene alpha methylstyrene, methacrylate butadiene styrene and other high impact styrene containing polymers. Other known impact modifiers include various elastomeric materials such as organic silicone rubbers, organic silicone polysiloxane polymers, elastomeric fluorohydrocarbons, elastomeric polyesters, polysiloxane polycarbonate copolymers, etc. Generally any minimum quantity of impact modifier which positively upgrades the impact strength of the polycarbonates of the instant invention can be employed.Greater than this minimum quantity may be employed as long as the properties desired for a particular application of the polycarbonate are substantially maintained. Generally, a minimum of about two weight percent is sufficient to observe an increase 1t the impact strength. A minimum of about four weight percent of the impact modifier, based on the amount of impact modifier and polycarbonate resin present, is preferred. A level of about fifteen weight percent should generally not be exceeded, preferably about ten weight percent. Weight percent is measured as the amount of impact modifier in the total of impact modifier plus the aromatic polycarbonate resin of this invention. The compositions of this embodiment may be compounded in the usual manner, for example blending the resin with the impact modifier in a dry form, for example powder or granules and the like and then extruding the composition.

The instant blends may generally be prepared by first preforming the resins A and B and thereafter physically mixing or blending these resins together. Still another embodiment of the instant invention are copolyester carbonates derived from i a carbonate precursor, ii at least one dihydric phenol of Formula Ia, and preferably of Formula Ib, and iii at least one difunctional carboxylic acid or an ester forming reactive derivative thereof. Briefly stated, the copolyester carbonates comprise recurring carbonate groups, carboxylate groups, and aromatic carbocyclic groups in the linear polymer chain, in which at least some of the carboxylate groups and at least some of the carbonate groups are bonded directly to the ring carbon atoms of the aromatic carbocyclic groups. These copolyester c2rbonates contain ester bonds and carbonate bonds in the polymer chain, wherein the amount of ester bonds is in the rangeof from about 25 to about 90 mole . prefer,ably from about 35 to about 80 mole . For example, 5 moles of bisphenol A reacting completely with 4 moles of isophthaloyl chloride and 1 mole of phosgene would give a copolyester carbonate of 80 mole ester bonds. Conventional copolyester carbonates in general, and methods for their preparation, are disclosed inU.S. Patent 3,169,121, which is hereby incorporated by reference. In general, any difunctional carboxylic acid conventionally used in the preparation of linear polyesters may be utilized in the preparation of the linear copolyester carbonate resins of the present invention.The carboxylic acids which may be used include the aliphatic carboxylic acids, aliphatic aromatic carboxylic acids, and aromatic carboxylic acids. These acids are disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. Patent 3,169,121. The difunctional carboxylic acids which may be utilized in the preparation of the copolyester carbonate resins of the instant invention generally conform to the general formula vin. R3 R4 COOH wherein R4 is an alkylene, alkylidene, aralkylene, aralkylidene or cycloaliphatic group containing ethylenic unsaturation an aromatic group such as phenylene, biphenylene, substituted phenylene, and the like two or more aromatic groups connected through non aromatic linkages such as alkylene or alkylidene groups and the like. R3 is either a carboxyl group or a hydroxyl group. The letter 3 q represents one where R is a hydroxyl group and either zero or one where R3 is a carboxyl group. rreferred difunctional carboxylic acids are the aromatics difunctional carboxylic acids, i.e., those acids of Formula VIII where q is one, R3 is a carboxyl or a hydroxyl group, and R4 is an aromatic group such as phenylene, naphthylene, biphenylene, substituted phenylene, and the like. The preferred aromatic difunctional carboxylic acids are those represented by the general formulaEMI51.1 wherein R3 is as defined above R5 is independently selected from halogen radicals, monovalent hydrocarbon radicals, and monovalent hydrocarbonoxy radicals and p represents a whole number having a value of from 0 t 4 inclusive. The preferred halogen radicals represented by R5 are chlorine and bromine. The monovalent hydrocarbon radicals represented by R5 are selected from alkyl radicals, aryl radicals, alkaryl radicals, aralkyl radicals, and cycloalkyl radicals. The preferred alkyl radicals, aryl radicals, alkaryl radicals, aralkyl radicals and cycloalkyl radicals are the same as those defined for R hereinafore.The monovalent hydrocarbonoxy radicals represented by R5 are selected from alkoxy radicals and aryloxy radicals. The preferred alkoxy radicals and aryloxy radicals represented by R5 are the same as those defined by R hereinafore. Preferred radicals represented by R5 are the monovalent hydrocarbon radicals, with the alkyl radicals being the preferred monovalent hydrocarbon radicals. Mixtures of two or more different difunctional acids may be employed as well as single individual difunctional carboxylic acids. Therefore, where the term difunctional carboxylic acid is used herein it is meant to include mixtures of two or more different difunctional carboxylic acids as well as single difunctional carboxylic acids.

A particularly useful mixture of isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid is one wherein the weight ratio of isophthalic acid to terephthalic acid is in the range of from 1 10 to 9.8 0.2. Rather than utilizing the difunctional carboxylic acids per se it is preferred to employ their ester forming reactive derivatives such as, for example, the acid halides. Particularly useful acid halides are the acid chlorides. Thus, for example instead of using isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, or mixtures thereof it is preferred to utilize isophthaloyl dichloride, terephthaloyl dichloride, or mixtures thereof. One of the methods for preparing the copolyester carbonates of the instant invention involves the heterogeneous interfacial polymerization system utilizing an aqueous caustic solution, an organic water immiscible solvent, at least one dihydric phenol represented by Formula Ia, at least one difunctional carboxylic acid or an ester forming reactive derivative thereof, a catalyst, a mol ecular weight regulator, and a carbonate precursor.A preferred heterogeneous interfacial polymerization system is one which utilizes phosgene as the carbonate precursor and methylene chloride or chlorobenzene as the organic solvent.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT In order to more fullv and clearly illustrate the present invention the following examples are set forth. It is intended that the examples be considered as illustrative rather than limiting the invention as disclosed and claimed herein. In the examples all parts and percents are on a weight basis unless otherwise indicated. The following examples illustrate polycarbonates falling outside the scope of the instant invention and are presented for comparative purposes only. EXAMPLE 1 This example illustrates the preparation of a bisphenol A polycarbonate. Into a mixture of 2283 grams of pure 4,4 isopropylidenebisphenol bisphenol A , 5700 grams water, 9275 grams methylene chloride, 32.0 grams phenol, and 10 grams of triethylamine, are introduced, at ambient temperature, 1180 grams of phosgene over a period of 97 minutes while maintaining the pH of the tio phase system at about 11, i.e., pH 10 12.5, by simultaheously adding a 25 aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. At the end of the addition period, the pH of the aqueous phase is 11.7 and the bisphenol A content of this phase is less than 1 part per million ppm as determined by ultraviolet analysis. The methylene chloride phase is separated from the aqueous phase, washed with an excess of dilute O.OlN aqueous HC1 and then washed three times with deionized water. The polymer is precipitated by steam and dried at 95 C. The resultant, pure bisphenol A polycarbonate has an intrinsic viscosity IV in methylene chloride at 25tC of 0.572 dlXgm and a second order glass transition temperature of 149 C. The second order glass transition temperature is determined by using aPerkins ElmerDSC 2B instrument which measures the second order glass transition temperature Tg by differential scanning calorimetry. The Tg is an indication of the heat resistance of the polymer. Generally, the higher the Tg the more heat resistant the polymer.

Sufficient 25 aqueous sodium hydroxide solution is added to this reaction mixture to maintain a pH of about 11. Phosgene is then introduced into the reaction mixture at a rate of 36 grams per minute for a period of 32 minutes while maintaining the pH at about 11 by the use of the aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. After addition of the phosgene ceases the methylene chloride phase is separated from the aqueous phase, washed with dilute O.OlN HC1, and washed three times with deionized water. The polymer is then precipitated by steam and dried at 95 C. The Tg of this polymer is determined to be 132 C. EXAMPLE 5 This example illustrates the preparation of a dialkyl substituted cyclopentadecylidenebisphenól polyearbonate falling outside the scope of the instant invention. Into a reaction mixture containing 5 grams 0.0118 mole of l,l bis 3 methy 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclopentadecane m.p. 213 2140C , 0.033 milliliter of triethylamine, 400 milliliters of methylene chloride, and 300 milliliters of water there is added sufficient 25 aqueous sodium hydroxide solution to bring the pH of the reaction mixture to about 11. Phosgene is then introduced into this well stirred reaction mixture at a rate of 0.5 gram per minute for a period of 6.5 minutes while maintaining the pH at about 11 by the use of the aqueous caustic solution.

During the phosgene addition period the originally colorless solution turns a muddy green color. After the phosgene addition ceases the reaction mixture is stirred for 10 minutes. The reaction mixture is then added to an excess of methanol and stirred in a Warring blender. The precipitated polymer is filtered, and the filter cake is then slurried with water, filtered and washed. The filter cake is dried in a vacuum oven at 50 C. The resultant polycarbonate is found to have an intrinsic viscosity in methylene chloride at 250C of 0.427 dl gm.This polymer has a second order glass transition temperature, Tg, of 145 C. The following examples illustrate the preparation of the novel tetraalkyl substituted cycloalkylidene bisphenols of the instant invention.

Solids begin to separate out from the reaction mixture and when the reaction mixture becomes too thick to stir an additional 100 milliliters of methylene chloride are added.The reaction is followed by gas chromatographic analysis of samples removed from the reaction mixture. When gas chromatographic analysis of the samples taken from the reaction mixture indicates the absence of the macrocylic ketone the reaction mixture is filtered by suction and the solids are washed with methylene chloride. The solids are then slurried up with fresh methylene chloride, filtered and rinsed again with more solvent. Analysis by gas chromatography of the dried solids, which melted at 239 240.50C, showed that they had a retention time of 27.85 minutes relative to p cumylphenol which emerged at 13.91 minutes.

There is a wide variation in the second order glass transition temperatures of these cycloalkylidene conatining polycarbonates.Indeed, some of these cycloalkylidene containing polycarbonates exhibit lower Tgs than the conventional alkylidene containing polycarbonates such as those based on bisphenol A. Thus, while a polycarbonate derived from 4,4 cyclohexylidene bisphenol Example 3 has a higher Tg than a polycarbonate derived from 1, 1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane Example 1 , a polycarbonate derived from l,l bis 3 methyl 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclohexane example 4 has a Tg which is lower than that of said bisphenol A type polycarbonate. The presence of larger cycloalkylidene bridging groups in the dihydric phenol does not insure that the resultant polycarbonates will exhibit higher second order glass transition temperatures. Thus, a polycarbonate derived from 1, 1 bis 3 methyl 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclopentade cane Example 5 has a lower Tg than a polycarbonate derived from the smaller cycloalkylidene containing bisphenol l,l bis 3 methyl 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclododecane Example 2 . Indeed, the polycarbonate derived from the l,l bis 3 methyl 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclopentadecane Example 5 has a lower Tg than a polycarbonate derived from the much smaller cycloalkylidene containing bisphenol 4,4 cyclohexyli dene bisphenol Example 3 . The carbonate polymer of the instant invention Example 10 which is derived from 50 mole percent bisphenol A and 50 mole percent l,l bis 3,5 dimethyl4 hydroxyphenyl cyclododecane has a Tg of 240 C as compared with a Tg of 202 C of a similar polycarbonate falling outside the scope of the instant invention derived from 100 percent of l,l bis 3 methyl 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclododecane Example 2 . The carbonate polymers of the instant invention are useful in making films, sheets, molded articles, and the like. Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is, therefore, understood that changes may be made in the particular embodiments of the invention described and claimed which are within the full intended scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
