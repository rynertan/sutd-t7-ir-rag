# METHOD OF STABILIZING HYDROPHILIC POLYMER COMPOSITIONS AND STABILIZED HYDROPHILIC POLYMER COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
Hydrophylic copolymers of a an α,β monoethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid and b a C₂ C₆ hydroxyalkyl ester of an α,β monoethylenically unsaturated carboxylic ester and concentrated aqueous solutions thereof are stabilized against gelation by partial neutralization of the polymer to the extent of at least 25 , preferably 25 75 .
