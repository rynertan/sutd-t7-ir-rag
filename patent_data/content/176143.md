# Optical imaging system for a copying machine.

## Abstract
Optical imaging system for imaging an original 4 strip wise onto a light sensitive element 1 by means of an optical system 5 moving relatively to the original 4 and to the light sensitive element 1 , in which the image is compressed in one direction thereby maintaining a clear image. For that purpose the light sensitive element 1 is moved past the optical system 5 at a lower speed than the original 4 and under an acute angle with the image plane 21a , the speed difference between the original 4 and the light sensitive element 1 being correlated to the angle between the image plane 21a and the light sensitive element 1 so as to form a clear image on the light sensitive element.
