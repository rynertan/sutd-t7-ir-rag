# Photosensitive plate for electrophotography.

## Abstract
Known photosensitive plates can lack ozone resistance and moisture resistance. In order to overcome this problem, a photosensitive plate has a conductive substrate bearing a lay er of a dispersion of a photoconductor in a binder resin, in which the resin binder comprises an epoxy resin component, an amine type curing agent component, and an acid anhydride as an ozone deterioration preventing agent component. The photosensitive plates are used in electrophotography.
