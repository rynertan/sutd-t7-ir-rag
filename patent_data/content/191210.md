# Preparation of modified zeolites and their utilization.

## Abstract
A method for modifying the catalytic activity of a crystal line zeolite having a constraint index of 1 to 12 and a sili ca to alumina ratio of 30 to no greater than 300, comprises contacting said zeolite with gaseous boron trifluoride under conditions effective to reduce the alpha activity of the zeo lite.
