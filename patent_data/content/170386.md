## Description
This invention relates to bleaching compounds and to peroxygen bleaching compositions and processes therefor that provide effective bleaching of textiles over a wide range of temperatures. According to the present invention, there is provided a peroxyacid bleaching compound of the formula wherein R¹ is an alkyl, aryl or alkaryl group containing from 1 to 14 carbon atoms, R² is an alkylene, arylene or alkarylene group containing from 1 to 14 carbon atoms, and R⁵ is H or an alkyl, aryl or alkaryl group containing from 1 to 10 carbon atoms. A group of compounds which provides in aqueous solution the above peroxyacids are the magnesium salts of the peroxyacids of the following general formulas wherein R¹, R² and R⁵ are as defined for the peroxyacid, X is a compatible anion, n is one or two, and Y is from 0 to 6. The present invention also relates to a bleaching composition comprising a peroxygen bleaching compound capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution and a bleach activator of the following formula wherein R¹, R² and R⁵ are as defined for the peroxyacid, and L is a leaving group, the conjugate acid of which has a pKa in the range from 4 to 13. The invention further relates to a bleaching composition comprising peroxyacid bleaching compound. In a preferred embodiment, the bleaching compositions are incorporated into detergent compositions. Bleaching compositions comprising a peroxygen bleaching compound and an imide bleach activator are disclosed in US A 3,982,891. The invention relates to peroxyacid bleaching compounds of the following general formula wherein R¹ is an aryl, alkyl or alkaryl group with from 1 to 14 carbon atoms, R² is an alkylene, arylene, and alkarylene group containing from 1 to 14 carbon atoms, and R⁵ is H or an alkyl, aryl, or alkaryl group containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms. R¹ preferably contains from 6 to 12 carbon atoms. R² preferably contains from 4 to 8 carbon atoms. R¹ may be straight chain or branched alkyl, substituted aryl or alkylaryl containing branching, substitution, or both. Analagous structural variations are permissible for R². The substitution can include alkyl, aryl, halogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and other typical substituent groups of organic compounds. R⁵ is preferably H or methyl. R¹ and R⁵ should not contain more than 18 carbon atoms total. The bleaching compounds of the invention provide effective and efficient surface bleaching of textiles which thereby removes stains and or soils from the textiles. The compounds are particularly efficient at removing dingy soils from textiles. Dingy soils are those that build up on textiles after much usage and washing, and result in a gray or yellow tint on a white textile. These soils are a blend of particulate and greasy materials. In use, the compounds of the invention provide effective bleaching over a wide range of temperature 5 C to 85 C , a preferred range being from 30 C to 60 C. The presence of the polar amide or substituted amide moiety results in a peroxyacid which has a very low vapor pressure and thus possesses a low odor profile as well as an excellent bleaching performance. The improved thermal stability of the peroxyacids of the invention, especially when incorporated into the bleaching compositions and detergent compositions described hereinafter is surprising, especially when compared to alkyl peroxyacids, especially the short chain peroxyacids of the prior art, e.g. US A 4,412,934, Chung et al. While not wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that the polarity of the amide group results in a reduction of vapor pressure of the peroxyacid, and a corresponding increase in melting point. The substituted amide containing peroxyacids also have a reduced vapor pressure, and show good odor profiles. These compounds are well suited for use in the bleach activator structures provided hereinafter. The magnesium salt has the following general formula wherein R¹, R² and R⁵ are as defined for the peroxyacid, X is a compatible anion, n is 1 or 2, and Y is from 0 to 6. The compounds are solid and possess good storage under alkaline conditions such as when admixed with a detergent composition. The active oxygen in the magnesium peroxycarboxylate is readily available. This means that the solid magnesium peroxycarboxylates are readily soluble or dispersible and yield solutions containing peroxyacids. When the solution is aqueous, it cannot be distinguished from an aqueous solution prepared from the corresponding peroxyacid and an equivalent amount of magnesium, when the solutions are adjusted to the same pH. It is believed that the stability of the magnesium salt is due to the fact that the active oxygen atom is nucleophilic rather than electrophilic as it is in the corresponding peroxycarboxylic acid. Nucleophilic agents which would attack an electrophilic oxygen are much more prevalent in bleaching and detergent compositions than electrophilic agents. The magnesium peroxycarboxylates can be prepared via the process of US A 4,483,781, Hartman, issued November 20, 1984. The bleach activators for use in bleaching compositions of the invention are amide substituted compounds of the general formula wherein R¹, R² and R⁵ are as defined for the peroxyacid, and L is a leaving group as defined herein. A leaving group is any group that is displaced from the bleach activator as a consequence of the nucleophilic attack on the bleach activator by the perhydroxide anion. This, the perhydrolysis reaction, results in the formation of the peroxycarboxylic acid. Generally, for a group to be a suitable leaving group it must exert an electron attracting effect. It should also form a stable entity so that the rate of the back reaction is negligible. This facilitates the nucleophilic attack by the perhydroxide anion. The L group must be sufficiently reactive for the reaction to occur within the optimum time frame e.g., a wash cycle . However, If L is too reactive, this activator will be difficult to stabilize for use in a bleaching composition. These characteristics are generally paralleled by the pKa of the conjugate acid of the leaving group, although exceptions to this convention are known. The leaving groups for use herein are those in which their conjugate acid has a pKa in the range of from 4 to 13, preferably from 6 to 11 and most preferably from 8 to 11. Preferred bleach activators are those of the above general formula wherein R¹, R² and R⁵ are as defined for the peroxyacid and L is selected from wherein R¹ is as defined for the peroxyacid, R³ is an alkyl chain containing from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, R⁴ is H or R³, and Y is H or a solubilizing group. The preferred solubilizing groups are SO 3M , COO M , SO₄ M , N R 3 3 X and and most preferably SO 3M and COO M wherein R³ is an alkyl chain containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, M is a cation which provides solubility to the bleach activator and X is an anion which provides solubility to the bleach activator. Preferably, M is an alkali metal, ammonium or substituted ammonium cation, with sodium and potassium being most preferred, and X is a halide, hydroxide, methylsulfate or acetate anion. It should be noted that bleach activators with a leaving group that does not contain a solubilizing group should be well dispersed in the bleaching solution in order to assist in their dissolution. Preferred bleach activators are those wherein L is a leaving group as previously defined, R¹ is an alkyl group containing from 6 to 12 carbon atoms, R² is an alkylene group containing from 4 carbon atoms to 8 carbon atoms, and R⁵ is H or methyl. Particularly preferred bleach activators are those of the above general formula wherein R¹ is an alkyl group and R² is an alkylene group each containing from 1 to 14 carbon atoms, R⁵ is H, and L is selected from wherein R³ is as defined above and Y is SO 3M or COO M wherein M is as defined above. Especially preferred bleach activators are those wherein R¹ is a linear alkyl chain containing from 6 to 12 carbon atoms, R² is a linear alkylene chain containing from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, R⁵ is H, and L is selected from wherein R³ is as defined above and Y is SO 3M or COO M wherein M is as defined above. In the present invention, L is most preferably wherein M is sodium or potassium. The present invention also provides bleaching compositions comprising a bleaching compound of the formula wherein R¹, R² and R⁵ are as defined for the peroxyacid. The present invention further relates to bleaching compositions comprising a compound which provides in an aqueous solution a peroxy acid bleaching compound of the above formula wherein the compound is a magnesium peroxycarboxylate of the following general formula wherein R¹ is an alkyl, aryl or alkaryl group containing from 1 to 14 carbon atoms, R² is an alkylene, arylene or alkarylene group containing from 1 to 14 carbon atoms, and R⁵ is H or an alkyl, aryl or alkaryl group containing from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, wherein X is a compatible anion, n is 1 or 2, and Y is from 0 to 6. Such compositions provide extremely effective and efficient surface bleaching of textiles which thereby remove stains and or soils from the textiles. The compositions are particularly effective at removing dingy soils from textiles. Dingy soils are soils that build up on textiles after numerous cycles of usage and washing, and thus, result in a white textile having a gray or yellow tint. These soils tend to be blend of particulate and greasy materials. The removal of this type of soil is sometimes referred to as dingy fabric clean up . The bleaching compositions provide such bleaching over a wide range of bleach solution temperatures. Such bleaching is obtained in bleach solutions wherein the solution temperature is at least 5 C. Inorganic peroxygen bleaches would be ineffective and or impracticable at temperatures below 60 C. This invention also relates to bleaching compositions containing a peroxygen bleach capable of releasing hydrogen peroxide in an aqueous solution and specific bleach activators, herein defined, wherein the molar ratios of hydrogen peroxide to bleach activator is greater than 1.0, and preferably is at least 1.5. The bleaching mechanism generally, and the surface bleaching mechanism in particular, are not completely understood. However, it is generally believed that the bleach activator undergoes nucleophilic attack by a perhydroxide anion, which is generated from the hydrogen peroxide evolved by the peroxygen bleach, to form a peroxycarboxylic acid. This reaction is commonly referred to as perhydrolysis. When the activators are used, optimum surface bleaching performance is obtained with bleaching solutions wherein the pH of such solution is between 8.5 and 10.5 and preferably between 9.5 and 10.5 in order to facilitate the perhydrolysis reaction. Such pH can be obtained with substances commonly known as buffering agents, which are optional components of the bleaching compositions herein. It is also believed, that the bleach activators within the invention can render peroxygen bleaches more efficient even at bleach solution temperatures wherein bleach activators are not necessary to activate the bleach, i.e., above 60 C. Therefore, with bleach compositions of the invention, less peroxygen bleach is required to get the same level of surface bleaching performance as is obtained with the peroxygen bleach alone. The bleaching compositions wherein the bleach activator is used also have, as an essential component a peroxygen bleach capable of releasing hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution. The level of the peroxygen bleaching compound within the composition of the invention is preferably from 1 to 60 . The peroxygen bleaching compounds useful herein are those capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in an aqueous solution. These compounds are well known in the art and include hydrogen peroxide and the alkali metal peroxides, organic peroxide bleaching compounds such as urea peroxide, and inorganic persalt bleaching compounds, such as the alkali metal perborates, percarbonates, perphosphates, and the like. Mixtures of two or more such bleaching compounds can also be used, if desired. Preferred peroxygen bleaching compounds include sodium perborate, commercially available in the form of mono , tri and tetra hydrate, sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate, sodium pyrophosphate peroxyhydrate, urea peroxyhydrate, and sodium peroxide. Particularly preferred are sodium perborate tetrahydrate and, especially, sodium perborate monohydrate. Sodium perborate monohydrate is especially preferred because it is very stable during storage and yet still dissolves very quickly in the bleaching solution. It is believed that such rapid dissolution results in the formation of higher levels of percarboxylic acid and, thus, enhanced surface bleaching performance. The level of bleach activator within the compositions of the invention is from 0.1 to 60 and preferably from 0.5 to 40 . When the bleaching compositions within the invention are also detergent compositions it is preferred that the level of bleach activator is from .5 to 20 . As a preferred embodiment, the bleaching compositions of the invention can be detergent compositions. Thus, the bleaching compositions can contain typical detergent composition components such as detergency surfactants and detergency builders. In such preferred embodiments the bleaching compositions are particularly effective. The bleaching compositions of this invention can contain all of the usual components of detergent compositions including the ingredients set forth in US A 3,936,537, Baskerville et al. Such components include color speckles, suds boosters, suds suppressors, antitarnish and or, anticorrosion agents, soil suspending agents, soil release agents, dyes, fillers, optical brighteners, germicides, alkalinity sources, hydrotropes, antioxidants, enzymes, enzyme stabilizing agents, perfumes, etc. Enzymes are highly preferred optional ingredients and can be incorporated in an amount of from 0 to 5 . Highly preferred compositions comprise from 0 to 5 of proteolytic or amylolytic enzymes or a mixture thereof. Suitable proteolytic enzymes include the many species known to be adapted for use in detergent compositions. Commercial enzyme preparations such as Alcalase RTM sold by Novo Industries, and Maxatase RTM sold by Gist Brocades, Delft, The Netherlands, are suitable. Other preferred enzyme compositions include those commercially available under the tradenames SP 72 Esperase RTM manufactured and sold by Novo Industries, A S, Copenhagen, Denmark and AZ Protease RTM manufactured and sold by Gist Brocades, Delft, The Netherlands.

The stability of N decanoyl 6 aminoperoxycaproic acid was determined, both alone and admixed with an alkaline detergent granule, at a variety of temperatures and humidities. The samples were stored in glass jars having vented tops. The activity of the remaining peroxyacid was determined by conventional iodometric titration for available oxygen. Samples which were admixes of peroxyacid and alkaline detergent granules consisted of 7 peroxyacid and 93 detergent granule. The results of this testing are tabulated below. The bleaching performance of N decanoyl 6 aminoperoxycaproic acid was determined in a series of experiments which compared the fabric whitening and stain removal of a treatment containing an alkaline detergent granule plus the peroxy acid, with a treatment containing the detergent granule alone. Thus, to each of two top loading automatic washing machines was added 2.5 kg 5 lbs of naturally soiled ballast fabrics and 68 liters of 63 C 95 F city water having a hardness of 102.6 mg CaCO₃ litre 6 gr gal . To one machine was added 89 g of an alkaline detergent granule and sufficient N decanoyl 6 aminoperoxycaproic acid to result in an available oxygen AvO level of 3.5 ppm in the wash solution. To the second machine was added only 89 g of the alkaline detergent granule. To each of the above wash solutions were added two sets of naturally soiled white fabrics and two sets of artificially stained swatches. The washing machines were then allowed to complete their normal washing and rinsing cycles, and the ballast and test fabrics were dryer dried. This procedure was repeated three times, using different sets of ballast fabrics, naturally soiled white fabrics and artificially stained swatches for each replicate. After completion of the three replicates, the fabrics and swatches were arranged under suitable lighting for comparison of soil and stain removal. Three expert graders compared the extent of removal of the soils and stains using the following scale The bleaching performance of the magnesium salt of N decanoyl 6 aminoperoxycaproic acid was determined using the procedure described in Example XII. The magnesium salt was added to the wash solution as a finely divided powder suspended in 50 mL methanol. The amount of magnesium salt added was that which provided a peroxyacid available oxygen AvO level of 3.5 ppm. The results obtained for this bleaching performance test are shown below.
