# Method of, and apparatus for, injecting liquid resin.

## Abstract
To enable liquid resin to be fed into a mould 25 from a container 11 the interior of the charged container is pressurised and a nozzle 16 on an outlet 17 of the container is positioned in a mould sprue 26. A valve 18 in the outlet 17 is opened to enable mixture to be driven into the mould 25 from the container 11. The valve 18 is closed when the mixture is sensed to have reached a remote part of the mould 25 or when mixture is no longer present in the outlet 17. Closure of the valve is accomplished by a regulator 20 acting in response to a signal from a sensor 22 disposed in the mould remotely from the nozzle 16 or from a sensor 29 in the outlet 17.

## Description
METHOD OF, AND APPARATUS FOR, INJECTING LIQUID RESINThis invention relates to a method of, and apparatus for, injecting liquid resin.Resin injection is a low pressure closed mould process used in the production of reinforced plastics components. The process makes use of a matched pair of moulds into which fibre reinforcement often glass fibre is introduced.With the moulds clamped together a cold setting catalysed resin mixture including such additives as are necessary is injected under low pressure through one or more inlets or spruces in the mould halves. Once the resin has hardened sufficiently the moulds can be opened and the cast component removed from the mould.According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of injecting liquid resin into a mould 25 by way of a nozzle 16 positioned to feed the mould by way of a mould sprue 26 characterised by the steps of i charging a pressurisible container 11 having an outlet nozzle 16 closed by a valve 18 with a given amount of a mixture of resin and such additives such as catalyst as may be required ii pressurising the interior of the charged container 11 iii disposing the charged container 11 so that the nozzle 16 is positioned to feed a mould cavity 28 by way of a mould sprue 26 iv causing the valve 18 to open to enable mixture to pass into the sprue 26 by way of the nozzle 16 under the action of a pressure differential existing between container interior and nozzle outlet and v closing the valve 18 when the mixture is observed or otherwise detected as filling the mould 25 .According to a first preferred version of the first aspect of the present invention the method is further characterised in that the step of closing the valve 18 is achieved by i positioning a mixture sensor 22 at a point in the mould 25 remote from the sprue 26 and ii feeding a signal output from the sensor 22 to a regulator adapted to operate the valve 18 so as to cause closure of the valve when the sensor 22 detects the presence of mixture at the point in the mould 25 remote from the sprue 26 .According to a second preferred version of the first aspect the method is characterised in that the step of closing the valve 18 is achieved by i positioning a mixture sensor 29 at a point in the outlet 17 between the valve 18 and the container 11 , and ii feeding a signal output from the sensor 29 to a regulator 20 adapted to operate the valve 18 so as to cause closure of the valve 18 when the sensor 29 detects the absence of mixture at the point in the nozzle 16 between the valve 18 and the container 11 .According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided apparatus for injecting liquid resin into a mould 25 by way of a nozzle 16 characterised by a pressurisble container 11 , with pressurising inlet 12 for pressurising its interior in a controlled manner, having an outlet 17 equipped with the nozzle 16 , the passage of mixture through the nozzle 16 being regulatable by way of a valve 18 positioned between the container 11 and the nozzle 16 .According to a preferred version of the second aspect of the present invention the apparatus of the second aspect is further characterised by the provision of i a sensor 22, 29 for mixture dispensed from the container 11 ii a regulator 20 for operating the valve 18 between open and closed positions and iii a signal transmitter 24 linking the sensor 22, 29 to the regulator 20 whereby the regulator 20 is enabled to operate the valve 18 in dependence on the output of the sensor 22, 29 . Typically the sensor 22 is positioned in a mould with which the apparatus is used to cause the regulator to operate the valve when the sensor detects the presence of the material at a point remote from the sprue of the mould. Alternatively the sensor 29 is positioned between the valve and the nozzle to cause the regulator to operate the valve when the sensor detects the absence of material following completion of discharge or a break in flow.Preferably the sensor, regulator and valve are air operated and controlled.To provide for ready operation of the apparatus according to the invention in a production environment the container, regulator, sensor and signal transmitting means are incorporated into a single unit. Typically with such a unit its weight would be sustained by a cable and supplies of material and compressed air are fed to the unit by flexible cables.An exemplary embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawing which is a diagrammatic view of an injection moulding apparatus.Air at a regulated pressure is fed to the interior of a cylinder 11 by way of inlet 12. Port 13 allows the interior of the cylinder 11 to be readily charged with resin mixture for injection or with solvent for cleaning as required. The port 13 is closed by a plug 14. A pressure relief valve 31 is provided at the upper end of the cylinder. The cylinder 11 has an outlet 15 with nozzle 16 at its outer end. The outlet includes a translucent pressure tube 17. The nozzle 16 is coupled to a flow control valve 18 and a flow restrictor 19 whose effect can be varied as required. Operation of the valve 18 is governed by a compressed air regulator 20 which can be operated manually by plunger 21 but is intended for automatic control by means of an output signal from a sensor 22 fed to the regulator 20 by way of line 23. The sensor 22 acts to detect the presence or absence of material at the tip of probe 24. In the present example the probe 24 is positioned in a mould cavity at a point in mould 25 remote from a sprue 26 by means of which the mould 25 is filled from nozzle 15. The most suitable remote position may need to be determined by experiment to ensure that injection is not terminated by operation of the sensor until the mould is filled.The apparatus is shown immediately prior to an injection step with the container 11 having been charged with a mixture 27 of resin, catalyst and such other additives as are necessary.. The material is added by way of port 13 which is subsequently closed by plug 14. The interior of the container 11 is then pressurised by means of compressed air fed into the container 11 by way of inlet 12. With the nozzle 16 positioned in the sprue 26 valve 18 is opened to allow mixture to pass into mould cavity 28 of the mould 25. The use of air or other suitable inert gas to pressurise the interior of the container ensures a reasonable filling time. Once material impinges on the probe 24 the sensor acts to transmit a signal to regulator 20 to cause the valve 18 to close. Apart from reducing material wastage this serves to prevent the passage of air down the tube 17 into the mould with a consequent deletarious effect on the injected material.The rapid response time of the sensor valve combination enables accurately metered quantities of mixture to be used with minimum wastage. Sensor 29 is positioned to detect a lack of material in the tube 17 to provide a valve closing signal. This can be in place of, or in combination with, the sensor 22 referred to above which operates on sensing the presence of material at a point remote from the sprue In apparatus utilising both such sensors the output of each could be combined in a variety of ways to promote efficient and or safe operation.If necessary sufficient mixture can be added to the container to enable a number of moulds to be filled before replenishing the container 11. In this case a sensor disposed to detect a lack of material in the tube 17 would only operate in respect of the final injection or in the event of a break occuring in the flow of material along the tube 17.Following the step of mixture injection a supply of solvent is added to the container 11 and the valve opened with the nozzle directed into a solvent collector. This ensures that the internals of the container 11, tube 17, valve 18 and nozzle 16 are cleared of residual mixture. It has been found that a charge of solvent can carry out a large number of separate cleaning cycles before it needs to be replaced with fresh solvent. The translucent tube 17 allows the process of injection to be monitored visually and the geometry of the container 11 and tube 17 is designed to provide that the speed of the free surface of a charge of mixture when it passes down the tube at the end of the injection step is slow enough to enable an alert supervisor to stop injection manually by operating plunger 21. Such action could be required to cope with an emegency in a normally automatic injection sequence. Typically in the course of operation the outputs could be compared at different stages to check that material is flowing as expectedAir operated sensor, regulator and valve arrangements are preferred.
