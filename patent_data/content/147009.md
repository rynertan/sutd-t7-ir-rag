# X ray scanner.

## Abstract
A light controlled X ray scanner has a ring cathode 24 and a ring anode 22 located parallel one another within an annular evacuated chamber 10 . A light beam derived from source 30 through optical system 40 sweeps round a surface of the cathode 24 as mirror 41 rotates. Electrons are emitted from the part of cathode on which the light beam is incident and those electrons are accelerated towards the anode 22 to produce X rays.
