# Method and apparatus for comparing logic functions.

## Abstract
Techniques for displaying on a cathode ray tube a plurality of logic signals either from a single electronic circuit under test wherein the signals are acquired by a single probe, or in comparison to signals from a known good electronic circuit of the same type wherein compensation is provided to eliminate differences in the logic signals that are due to differences in the timing signal frequencies of the two circuits.
