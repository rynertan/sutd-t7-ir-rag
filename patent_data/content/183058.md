# Foamable organosiloxane compositions.

## Abstract
Polyorganosiloxane foams exhibiting a desirable com bination of low density, an average cell size between 0.2 and 4 mm and a cell concentration of at least 4 per linear centimeter are obtained by dispensing and curing moisture curable organosiloxane compositions containing a dispersed liquid or gaseous blowing agent and, as a foam stabilizer, a resinous organosiloxane copolymer comprising trimethylsi loxy units, SiO₄₂ units and fluorine containing organosilox ane units. The polymer portion of the organosiloxane compositions can be a polydimethylsiloxane or a graft copolymer comprising at least 20 mole percent of dimethyl siloxane units in combination with organic units.
