## Description
The present invention relates to a method of and apparatus for removing sulfur oxides and other acidic gases from hot flue gases, in which an absorption agent and liquid water are introduced and dispersed in a stream of hot flue gases in a reaction zone wherein sulfur oxides and other acidic gases are absorbed by and reacted with the absorption agent in the presence of evaporating liquid water, producing a dry powder comprising reaction products and unreacted absorption agent suspended in flue gas, whereafter the powder is separated from the flue gas in a separating zone and partly recycled to the reaction zone. Such a method will hereinafter be described as of the kind described . Various processes for removing sulfur oxides and other acidic gases from flue gas from e.g. power plants and incinerators are known. A review of such processes is given in US A 4,197,278. Most of these fall within one of the following main groups The semi dry methods provide highly improved sulfur oxide removal and absorbent utilization compared to the dry methods, although in general not as high as that which may be obtained by the wet methods, easily dischargeable desulfurized flue gas and a dry, flowable solid powder as end product. Semi dry methods are described in a number of patents and patent applications US A 3,932,587 describes SO₂ removal by treating a hot flue gas with an aqueous alkali metal carbonate and or bicarbonate solution or slurry in a spray dryer after fly ash has been removed from the hot flue gas. GB A 2,021,086 describes a similar process utilizing a less expensive absorption agent Ca OH ₂ suspended in water. Improved lime utilization is achieved by avoiding fly ash removal from the hot inlet gas and by recirculation of a part of the powdery end product from the spray dryer to the aqueous slurry directed to the spray dryer. The viscosity of the aqueous slurry of absorption agent and recirculated powder, however, puts narrow limits to the amount of powder recirculated. In order to overcome this disadvantage it was suggested in Danish Patent Application No. 3959 79 DE A 3034896 to recirculate the powder by blowing the dry powder directly into the spray dryer. It is known that a key parameter describing the operating conditions of semi dry methods is the approach to saturation temperature known as AST , defined as reaction zone exit gas temperature minus gas saturation temperature, and that sulfur oxide removal in a spray dryer as well as in an associated fabric filter increases dramatically when AST tends to zero. It is, however, impractical to operate a spray dryer at low AST values because of risk of what is called wet bottom , i.e. accumulations of moist or wet product on the walls and the bottom of the spray dryer, which increases with decreasing AST. Such accumulations are highly undesirable because they lead to troublesome handling and discharge of solid material precipitated in the spraydryer. Low AST values are also undesirable because they will lead to inoperable conditions in an associated bag filter. Although great efforts have been devoted to developing semi dry flue gas desulfurization methods employing spray dryers, and although such methods have been realised in full scale operations on flue gases produced by combustion of low sulfur coals and containing reactive alkaline fly ash, i.e. fly ash with an alkali content contributing to the absorption of sulfur oxides and other acidic gases in the spray dryer, there is a need for an effective, commercially feasible method and a simple compact apparatus for removing sulfur oxides and other acidic gases from flue gas, in particular from flue gas produced in power plants and incinerators, providing adequate sulfur oxide removal and efficient utilization of absorption agent. From the paper Rauchgasreinigung nach der Abfallverbrennung , pages 242 to 259 published at 12th Waste Economy Seminar at the Technical University Berlin, 1981, a method of removing acidic components from hot exhaust gases, in which a rising stream of hot flue gasses is axially introduced through a frusto conical bottom wall, into the lower part of a reaction zone which comprises a vertical cylindrical chamber. By so doing the gases may be subjected to a rapid reduction in velocity so as to cause boundary layer separation by peeling off the uppermost layer of the dry powder from the stream in the lower part of the reaction zone the absorption agent, the water and the powder are introduced, dispersed and suspended in the rising stream of hot flue gas, into a central inlet duct to the lower part of the reaction zone the resulting dry powder is removed from the upper part of the reaction zone suspended and entrained in the flue gases and the powder is separated from the suspension in said separating zone. It has now been found that it is possible to perform a method of this general kind, which allows large concentrations of suspended material in the reaction zone and provides a radically increased gas solid contact, resulting in adequate sulfur oxide removal and efficient utilization of absorption agent without the risk of the wet bottom phenomena of spray dryers, and which can be carried out in a compact apparatus of uncomplicated design. The invention is characterised in that the absorption agent and water are fed to the reaction chamber directly into the central inlet duct through which the hot flue gases are fed to the reaction zone, whereby the water and absorption agent are subsequently intimately mixed with the flue gases due to the high velocity of the flue gases in the inlet duct. This method provides an extremely intimate gas solid contact for several reasons The method of the invention allows a significantly higher concentration of suspended material in the reaction zone than that achieved by methods operating with a descending or horizontal co current gas particle flow. Furthermore, the large build up and rapid recirculation of material in the reaction zone provides a reduced risk of disturbances due to very low AST values. The temperature of the hot flue gases introduced into the reaction zone is in general above 120 C. When the hot flue gas is flue gas from a power plant, the temperature is in general within the range 110 to 250 , typically 140 to 180 C. If desired fly ash may be removed totally or partially from the hot flue gases before it is introduced into the reaction zone. The velocity of the hot flue gases entering the reaction zone may vary depending on the load and size of the particles circulating in the reaction zone. However, it must be sufficiently high to maintain particle support in the reaction zone and prevent particle fall out from the bottom of the zone. The reduced velocity of the flue gases must be sufficiently high to ensure transport of the particles out of the upper part of the reaction zone, but sufficiently low to ensure proper material build up in the reaction zone. According to a preferred embodiment the velocity of the hot flue gases is reduced from between 25 and 45 m sec. to between 3 and 6 m sec., and the reduction in velocity corresponds to a velocity ratio v Proper boundary layer separation and corresponding turbulence are secured with the above mentioned reduction in velocity, in particular when the reduction in velocity takes place during a period of time of between 0.05 and 0.2 times the gas retention time in the reaction zone. Such boundary layer separation is generated by directing the hot flue gases through a divergent annular frusto conical bottom part of the reaction zone, preferably having an apex angle greater than 12 , more preferably between 12 and 120 , in particular between 40 and 90 . Apex angles greater than 120 are not desirable because of the risk of undesirable material build up on the frusto conical bottom of the reaction zone. The absorption agent is preferentially selected among members of the group comprising oxides and hydroxides of calcium and magnesium and oxides, hydroxides and carbonates of alkali metals. For economic reasons Ca OH ₂, preferentially prepared by slaking in a detention slaker, attrition slaker or ball mill, is the preferred absorption agent. Absorption agent may be introduced as a dry powder or suspended or dissolved in water, and water may be introduced separately, mixed with the absorption agent, or only part of the water may be mixed with the absorption agent. In order to achieve a high absorption agent utilization, the absorption agent is preferentially introduced suspended or dissolved in water. The water or the suspension or solution of absorption agent in water is preferentially introduced in the reaction zone at a position where the flue gas velocity is high. In preferred operating conditions the gas retention time in the reaction zone is 1 to 5 seconds, preferably 2 to 3 seconds, and the material retention time in the reaction zone is 1 to 8 minutes, preferentially 3 to 5 minutes, where the material retention time t where H As mentioned above the powder comprises reaction products and unreacted absorption agent. However, the flue gas entering the reaction zone will in general entrain fly ash particles which will be precipitated in the separating zone. Fly ash may contain reactive alkalies capable of reacting with sulfur oxides and other acidic gases under proper conditions, resulting in a reduced demand for absorption agent. According to a preferred embodiment, the powder recirculation rate is equal to 10 to 70 times, preferentially 15 to 30 times, the input rate of absorption agent and solid particles present in the hot flue gas, where the input rate of the absorption agent is defined as the input rate of fresh absorption agent not comprising unreacted absorption agent introduced with the powder. The material retention time in the reaction zone is controlled by the powder recirculation rate. The average particle diameter of the recirculated powder is preferentially within the range 20 to 250 µm. This preferred size may be ensured by subjecting the dry powder separated in the separating zone to size adjustment, e.g. screening, or size reduction by comminution, e.g. in a hammer mill, before it is recirculated to the reaction zone. Proper AST values are obtained when water is introduced into the reaction zone in an amount corresponding to 50 to 100 of the amount needed to cool the flue gas to the adiabatic saturation temperature. AST falls in general in the range of 0 to 40 C, preferentially in the range 5 to 20 C, and in particular within the range 8 to 16 C. If desired, e.g. when operating with very low AST, the exit gas may be reheated, e.g. by by passing a portion of the hot flue gas around the reaction zone. After leaving the reaction zone, the flue gas is dedusted, whereby powder comprising unreacted absorption agent, reaction products and fly ash are removed in the separating zone in one or two steps in separators known per se. In a preferred embodiment the separating zone comprises two sub zones, a first sub zone for precipitation of coarse particles and a second sub zone for precipitation of fine particles. The invention also includes apparatus for carrying out the method, which apparatus includes a reaction chamber formed by a vertical cylindrical chamber, a bottom part having an upwardly divergent annular frusto conical bottom wall, a central inlet for hot flue gases in the bottom wall, ducts positioned for feeding absorption agent, powder and liquid water into the lower part of the reaction chamber, and a suspension outlet at the top of the reaction chamber connected to a particle precipitator having a powder outlet duct communicating with the powder feeding duct, characterised in that the duct or ducts, through which absorption agent and water are fed to the reaction chamber, feed directly into the inlet duct, whereby the water and absorption agent are subsequently intimately mixed with the flue gases due to the high velocity of the flue gases in the inlet duct. The extremely intimate gas solid contact and the high concentration of solid material in the reaction zone permit the use of a very compact apparatus of simple design and corresponding low investment costs. Proper boundary layer separation at the lower part of the reaction zone, i.e. at the annular bottom wall, and corresponding generation of turbulence are secured when the apex angle of the annular bottom wall is greater than 12 , preferentially within the range 12 to 120 , in particular 40 to 90 , and when the ratio A In a preferred embodiment the absorption agent is introduced into the reaction chamber suspended or dissolved in water, water and absorption agent being fed through the same feeding duct to the reaction chamber. The feeding duct for the water or the water and absorption agent is preferentially provided with a gas liquid spray nozzle e.g. a venturi injection nozzle. Particle precipitators of any known type may be used, but preferably the particle precipitator comprises a coarse separator, e.g. a cyclone separator, arranged upstream of a fine separator, e.g. an electrostatic filter or a fabric filter. The invention will now be further described with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawing of apparatus according to the invention. The apparatus comprises a tubular reaction chamber 1 provided with an annular frusto conical bottom wall 2 and an inlet duct 3 for hot flue gases, an inlet duct 4 for absorption agent suspended or dissolved in water, and an inlet duct 5 for recirculated dry powder. The top of the reaction chamber is connected to a particle precipitator comprising a separating cyclone 6 with a material outlet 7 provided with a splitting gate 8 dividing the powder into two streams, one being recirculated to the reaction chamber 1, the other being discharged as waste product through a duct 9. The exit gas from the separating cyclone 6 is directed via a gas outlet duct 10 to an electrostatic filter 6 with a material outlet 7 and a gas outlet duct 10 . The fine powder precipitated in the electrostatic filter may be discharged as waste product or recirculated totally or partially to the reaction chamber. If desired, the inlet duct 4 may be replaced by two ducts, one for water and another for absorption agent.
