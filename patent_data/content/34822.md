# Speed control circuit for an electric power tool.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to electric power tools 10 and in particular to a method and apparatus for controlling the rotational speed of portable electric power tools, for example an electronically controlled drill, hammer drill, rotary ham mer, and the like, in both the forward and reverse directions. It is the primary object of the present invention to provide a speed control circuit for an electric power tool 10 which is adapted to control the speed of the electric motor 14 in both the forward and reverse directions and in which the speed control circuit 76, 80, 82, 86 is adapted to limit the rotational speed of the motor in the reverse direction to keep commuta tion problems to an acceptable level. According to the present invention, a power tool 10 driven by an electric motor 14 includes a speed control circuit 76, 80, 82, 86 for enabling a user to selectably control the forward speed of rotation of the motor, means RS for reversing the direction of rotation of the motor, and a speed control and limiting arrangement 98 operable when the direction of rotation of the motor is reversed to automatically limit the speed of rotation of the motor 14 to a predeter mined maximum speed while allowing variation up to the maximum speed. Additionally, the speed control circuit may also include means 92 for sensing a change in the condition of the revers ing switch RS and removing power from the motor until its speed drops to a relatively low level, or completely to zero, before re applying power in the reverse direction.
