# Graphic arts film and method of preparing same.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a graphic arts film obtained by forming a toner image on a light transmitting base sheet having a toner adhesive and ink repellent coat ing layer, then fixing the toner image and applying ink onto the surface of the base sheet to thereby selectively enhance the optical density of the toner image area on the coating layer, and a method of preparing the same. The present invention permits easy and inexpensive production of a graphic arts film having a sufficiently enhanced optical density, free from pin holes and capable of being retouched with respect to the image formed thereon.
