# Automatic taping unit with improved system of withdrawal of the tape applying rollers for carton sealing machines.

## Abstract
An inlet applying roller 3 and an outlet applying roller 15 are elastically urged to project, at rest, from a casing 1 which may be fixed to a sealing machine. The inlet applying roller 3 is rotatably supported by support arms 6 , which are movable along path defined by shaped windows 21 engaged with a fixed pivot 22 , and the outlet applying roller 15 is rotatably supported by lever arms 13 rotatable about a fixed fulcrum 16 . Said support arms 6 for the inlet and outlet rollers 3, 15 are kinematically connected to the sup port lever arms 13 of the outlet roller 15 so that the with drawal movement of the inlet roller 3 is accompanied by a simultaneous withdrawal movement of the outlet roller 15 and the successive coming out movement of the inlet roller 3 is made dependent on a simultaneous coming out move ment of the outlet roller 15 . A cutting blade 37 is arranged between said rollers 3, 15 to cut the tape between subse quent cartons.
