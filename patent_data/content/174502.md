# Improved method for high spatial resolution spectroscopic NMR imaging of chemically shifted nuclei.

## Abstract
An improved method for providing a high spatial resolution NMR image, having resolved artifact free NMR images of chemically shifted nuclei, includes forming a pair of NMR images each having imaging components of each of the chemically shifted nuclei due to projections in one of a pair of opposite directions along a common line mirroring the imaging components of one of the NMR images about a line orthogonal to the common line registering and combin ing the mirrored image and the other image to eliminate a first one of the components and thus produce a composite image containing only the other component and a negative of the other component offset by twice the chemical shift and forming a resolved image of the other component by processing the composite image to eliminate the offset negative image. The resolved image may then be combined with one or more of the NMR images to produce a resolved image of the first component. The method requires only 2N projections to form the two N by N NMR images.
