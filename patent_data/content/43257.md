# Operational amplifier with programmable gain.

## Abstract
An operational amplifier includes a differential input amplifier stage 10 supplying first and second drive currents responsive to input signals applied to its input connections 2,4 . A first current amplifier 20 exhibiting gain factor G supplies currents to an output terminal 70 responsive to the first drive current, and a second current amplifier 40 exhibiting gain factor H supplies currents to that output terminal 70 responsive to the second drive current. Each of the first and second current amplifiers 20,40 includes means 60 for switching the value of its respective gain factor G or H between a plurality of values responsive to a control signal so the gain of the operational amplifier is programmable responsive to the control signal.
