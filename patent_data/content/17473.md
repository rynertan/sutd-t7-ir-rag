The presence o undesired vegetation causes substantial damage to useful crops, especially agri cultural products that satisfy man s basic food needs, such as barley, wheat, and the like. The current population explosion and concomitant world food shortage demand improvements in the efficiency of producing these crops. Prevention or minimizing the loss of a portion of such valuable crops by killing, or inhibiting the growth of undesired vegetation is one way of improving this efficiency. A wide variety of materials useful for killing, or inhibiting controlling the growth of undesired vegetation is available such materials are commonly referred to as herbicides. The need exists, however, for still more effective herbicides that destroy or retard weeds without causing significant damage to useful crops. Summary of the Invention According to this invention, there are provided compounds of Formula I and their agriculturally suitable salts, suitable agricultural compositions containing them, and methods of using them as selective, as well as general herbicides having both preemergence and postemergence activity or as plant growth regulants. These compounds are highly active herbicides. They are especially useful for controlling broadleaf weeds in wheat and barley.EMI5.1 wherein R is C 4 alkyl, NO2, C1, Br, S02NR1R2 where R1 and R2 are selected from C 1 C3 alkyl X is H, C1, Br, CH3, CH3CH2, alkoxy C1 C3, CF3, CH3S or CH3OCH2 Y is CH3 or CH30 and Z is CH or N. Preferred for their higher biological razor more favorable cost are those compounds of Formula I where R is NO2 and or X is CH3 or CH3O. Especially preferred compounds are 1 N 4 methoxy 6 methyl 2 pyrimidinyl aminocar bonyl 4 nitro 2 thiophenesulfonamide and 2 N 4 methoxy 6 methyl 1,3,5 triazin 2 yl amino carbonyl 4 nitro 2 thiophenesulfonamide. Detailed Description Synthesis Disclosures As shown in Equation 1, the compounds of FormulaI can be prepared by combining an appropriate 2aminotriazine or 2 aminopyrimidine of Formula II with an appropriately substituted thiophenesulfonyl isocyanate of Formula III i, X, Y and Z being as previously defined. Equation 1EMI6.1 The reaction is best carried out in inert aprotic solvents such as methylene chloride, acetonitrile or tetrahydrofuran at ambient temperature and pressure. The mode of addition is not critical however, it is often convenient to add the sulfonyl isocyanate to a stirred suspension of the aminoheterocycle. Since such ianates are usually liquids, or low melting solids soluble in the solvents used, their addition is more easily controlled. Time of reaction is between 1 hour and 24 hours. The reaction is generally exothermic. In some cases, the desired product crystallizes from the reaction medium in pure form. Products soluble in the reaction mixture are isolated by evaporation of the solvent, trituration of the solid residue with solvents such as 1 chlorobutane, pentane or ethyl ether and filtration. The intermediate, novel, sulfonyl isocyanates are prepared from the corresponding thiophenesulfonamides via their N butylcarbamoyl intermediate according toEquations 2 and 3, wherein R is as previously defined. Equation 2 shows the formation of the intermediate butylcarbamoyl derivative and Equation 3 shows the conversion of this intermediate to the sulfonyl iso cyanate by the reaction of phosgene with the N butyl carbamoyl derivative. Equation 2EMI7.1 Equation 3EMI8.1 The reaction of Equation 2 is best carried out by combining equivalent amounts of the sulfonamide, butyl isocyanate and potassium carbonate in a polar solvent such as acetone and stirring for 1 16 hours between ambient and reflux temperature. The product is isolated by pouring the mixture into ice water, adjusting the pM to about 2 and isolating the product StractureV by filtration or extraction into methylene chloride. The product from Equation 2 is dried thoroughly, placed in an aprctic organic solvent such as xylene and heated to reflux under a dry ice cooled condenser.Phosgene is passed into the mixture until an excess is present whereupon the reflux temperature drops to 1200 without further addition of phosgene. Thiophenesulfonyl chlorides and amides can be prepared according to references cited in Thiophene and its Derivatives , H. D. Hartough, Interscience, New York, 1952. Nitrothiophene sulfonyl chlorides can be prepared according to A. H. Blatt et al.,J. Am Chem. Soc. 79, 1693 1957 . The aminotriazines and aminopyrimidines are prepared according to methods known in the art see U.S. Patent Specification No.4,127,405 . Agriculturally suitable salts of the compounds of claim 1 can also be made as described in the above U.S.Patent, to which the reader is referred for further information. In the following examples, unless otherwise indicated, all parts are by weight and all temperatures in 00. Examples 1 and 2 relate to intermediates. Example 1 N Butylaminocarbonvl 4 nitrothioDhene 2 s√πlfonamide A stirred suspension of 10 g of 4 nitrothiophene2 sulfonamide, 6 g of n butyl isscyanate and 7 g of anhydrous potassium carbonate in 100 ml of acetone was heated to reflux for 3 hours. The resultant viscous mixture was poured into ice water and the pH adjusted to 2 by the addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The resulting tarry precipitate thus obtained was extracted into methylene chloride, separated from the aqueous phase, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo.The residue which showed absorption peaks by nuclear magnetic resonance at .7 to 1.7 multiplet, consistent for butyl and at 8.3 and 8.5, consistent for the thiophene ring was used without further purification in the following reaction. Example 2 4 Nitrothiophene 2 sulfonyl isocyanate N Butylaminocarbonyl 4 nitrothiophenesulfonamide from the preceding example was stirred in 100 ml of xylene in a round bottom flask equipped with a dry ice condenser,gas inlet tube, thermometer and stirrer.When the temperature of the mixture reached 1300 phosgene was passed in until the temperature went down to 1200. The phosgene was turned off until the temperature returned to 1300 and the phosgene addition was resumed. This cycling was continued until the reflux temperature would not rise above 1200 with the phosgene off, indicating an excess of phosgene in the reaction mixture. After cooling, the mixture.was filtered and the filtrate concentrated in vacuo to yield 4.8 g of the desired sulfonyl isocyanate as an oil. It showed an infrared absorption peak at 2200 cm 1, consistent for the desired sulfonyl isocyanate. ExamPle 3N 4 Methoxy 6 methil 2 pyrimidinyl aminocarbonyl 4 nitrothiophene 2 sulfonamide To 1.4 g of 2 amino 4 methoxy 6 met5hilpyrimidine in 25 ml of anhydrous acetonitrile was added 2.4 g of 4 nitrothiophene 2 sulfonyl isocyanate with stirring at ambient temperature. After stirring for sixteen hours, the mixture was filtered and the precipitate washed with l chlorobutane. It melted at 155 with decomposition and showed an infrared absorption spec trum with peaks at 1700, 1620 and 1570 cm 1 consistent for the desired structure. By using the procedure of Example 3 with an ecuivalent amount of the appropriate aminopyrimidine and the appropriately substituted sulfonyl isocyanate, the compounds of Table I can be prepared.

They include dusts, granules, pellets, suspensions, emulsions, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and the like. Many df these can be applied directly. Spray able formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few liters to several hundred liters per hectare.The formulations may, broadly, contain about 0.18 to 995 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 1 to 99.9 solid or liquid diluent s . More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the approximate proportions set forth in Table III.

Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can, of course, be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound. Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are sometimes desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation, or by tank mixing. Some typical solid diluents are described inWatkins, et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers , 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell,New Jersey, but other solids, either mined or manufactured, may be used. The more absorptive diluents are preferred for wettable powders and the denser ones for dusts. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guide , 2nd Ed.,Interscience, New York, 1950.Solubility under 0.1 is preerred or suspension concentrates, solution concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation at OOC. McCutcheon s Detersents andEmulsifiers Annual , MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood,New Jersey, as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents , Chemical Publishing Co.,Inc., New York, 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foaming, caking, corrosion, microbiological growth, etc. The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by si nply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid composition are made by blending, and usually, grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see for example, Littler, U.S. Patent 3,060,084 . Granules and pellets may be made bv spraying the active material on preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J.

They may be applied either pre or postemergence for the control of undesired vegetation in noncrop areas and for selective weed control in certain crops, e.g., wheat and barley. Some of these compounds are useful for the pre and or postemergence control of nutsedge. By properly selecting rate and time of application, compounds of this invention may be used to modify plant growth beneficially. The precise amount of the compound of Formula I to be used in any given situation will vary according to the particular end result desired, the use involved, the weeds to be controlled, the soil type, the formulation and mode ofapplIcation, weather conditions and like factors. Since so many variables play a role, it is not possible to state a rate of application suitable for all situations. Broadly speaking, the compounds of this invention are used at levels of about 0.01 to 20 kg ha with a preferred range of 0.05 to 10 kg ha. The lower rates of the range will generally be selected for lighter soils, for selective weed control in crops or in situations where maximum persistence is not necessary. The compounds of Formula I may be combined with other herbicides and are particularly useful in combination with 3 3,4 dichloropheny 1,1 dimethylurea, the triazines such as 2,4 bis isopropylamino 6 methylthio s triazine, the uracils such as 5 bromo3 sec butyl 6 methyluracil, N phosponomethyl glycine, 3 cyclohexyl 1 methyl 6 dimethylamino s triazine 2,4 1H,3H dione,N,N dimethyl 2,2 diphenylacetamide,2,4dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and closely related compounds ,4 choloro 2 butynyl 3 chlorophenylcarbamate Carbyne , diisopropylthiolcarbamic acid, ester wit 2,3 dichloroallyl alcohol Avadex ,diisopropylthiol carbamic acid, S 2,3,3 trichloroallyl ester Avadex BW ,ethil N 3,4 dichlorophenyl 2 aminopropionate Suffixe ,1,2 dimetyl 3,5 diphenyl pyrazoliummethyl sulfate Avenges , methyl 2 4 2,4 dichlorophenoxy phenoxy propanoate Hoelon , a a.mino 6 tert butyl 3 methylthio 1,2,4 tYiazin 5 4H one Lexone ,3 3,4 dichlorophenyl 1 methoxy 1 methylurea Lorox ,3 isopropyl 1H 2,1,3 benzothio diazin 4 3H one 2,2 dioxide, alpha , alpha , alpha trifluoro 2,5 dinitro N,N dipropyl p toluidine, 1 dimethyl 4,4 bi pyridinium ion, monosodium methanearsonate, 2 chloro2 ,6 , diethyl methoxymetyl acetanilide,and 1,1 dimethyl 3 alpha , alpha , alpha trifluoro m tolyl urea Cotoran .
