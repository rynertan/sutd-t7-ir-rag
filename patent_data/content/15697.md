# Non electric delay detonator and assembly of a detonating cord and a delay detonator.

## Abstract
A non electric delay detonator adapted for field assembly with a low energy detonating cord 21 has an expansion shell 10 into which the cord is inserted at the time of use. The pres sure pulse resulting from the detonation of the cord causes the shell 10 to expand and an ignition charge 11 which is disposed between the shell 10 and a rigid capsule 6 to be actuated as a result of sudden compression between the ex pansion shell and the capsule. The burning ignition charge ig nites a delay charge 5 , which in turn ignites a priming charge 3 , causing a base charge 2 to detonate. The presence of ig nition charge in the annular spacing between the shell and capsule walls, as well as between the shell and capsule ends, and the proper positioning of cord gripping means 15 in shell cavity 13 , assure actuation of the ignition charge whether or not the cord is shoved to the bottom of the shell 10 .

## Description
NON ELECTRIC DELAY DETONATOR AND ASS Shl3LY OF A DETONATING CORD AD A DELAY DETONATOR The present invention relates to a nonelectric delay detonator, and to an assembly of a delay detonator and a low energy detonating cord adapted to actuate the detonator. The hazards associated with the use of electrical initiation systems for detonating explosive charges in mining o erations, i.e., the hazards of premature initiation by stray or extraneous electricity from such sources as lightning, static, galvanic action, stray currents, radio transmitters, and transmission lines, are well recognized. For this reason, nonelectric initiation through the userof a suitable detonating fuse or cord has been looked upon as a widely respected alternative. A typical high energy detonating cord has a uniform detonation velocity of about 6000 meters per second and comprises a core of 6 to 10 grams per meter of pentaerythritol tetranitrate PETN covered with various combinations of materials, such as textiles, waterproofing materials, plastcs, etc.However, the magnitude of tbe noise produced when a cord having such PETN core loadings is detonated on the surface of the earth, as in trun lines, often is unacceptable in blasting operations in developed areas. Also, the brisance shattering power of such a cord may be sufficiently high that the detonation impulse can be transmitted laterally to an adjacent section of the cord or to a mass of explosive which, for example, the cord contacts along its length.In the latter situation, the cord cannot be used to initiate an explosive charge in a borehole at the bottom the bottomhole priming technique , as is sometimes desired. Low energy detonating cord LEDC was developed to overcome the problems of noise and high brisance associated with the above described 6 10 grams per meter cord. LEDC has an explosive core loading of only about 0.02 to 2 grams per meter of cord length, and often only about 0.4 gram per meter.This cord is characterized by low brisance and the production of little noise, and therefore can be used as a trunkline in cases where noise has to be kept to a minimum, and as a downline for the bottom hole priming of an explosive charge. Until recently, most LEDC described in the art had a continuous core of a granular cap sensitive high explosive such as PETN heavily confined in a metal sheath or one or more woven textile sheaths. An improved LEDC which is light weight, flexible, stro, and non conductive, detonates at high velocity, and is readily adapted to high speed continuous manufacturing techniques is described in Belgian Patent 863,290, granted July 25, 1978, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.This improved cord has a continuous solid core of a deformable bonded detonating explosive composition comprising a crystalline high explosive compound adnixed with a ding aeet, and a protective plastic sheath enclosing the core, no metal or woven textile layers being present around the coe or sheath. Preferably, one or more continuous strands of reinforcing yarn, e.g., running substantially parallel to the core s longitudinal axis, are present outside the core. The loading of crystalline high explosive in the bonded explosive core is about from 0.1 to 2 g rams per meter of length. Because the low explosive loading of theLEDC core is insufficient to cause the detonation of explosive charges conventionally used in blasting, auxiliary means are used to relay the detonation stimulus from the cord to the charges to be initiated.Delay detonators, actuated by LEDC downlines, are used for this purpose, providing also a delay interval between the initiation of multiple charges. One such detonator, described in U.S. Patent 3,021,786, has an open ended metal capsule therein enclosing an air gap and having a central aperture. The air gap is between the end of a length of LEDC and an exothermic burning delay composition, the initiating impulse from the detonation of the explosive core of the LEDC jumping the air gap, passing through the aperture, and igniting the exothermic burning composition Peripheral crimps in the side wall of the detonator shell hold the cord in place, the latter forming a plug closure at the open end of the shell, so that the cord and detonator are formed into a composite unit or assembly at the time that the detonator is manufactured. In the cord detonator assembly described inU.S. Patent 3,122,097, the section of LEDC extending into the detonator shell has a lower looped portion positioned adjacent to the metal capsule that forms the air gap. The looped portion of cord is positioned in the shell by means of a resilient plug which is crimped in place so as to close off the open end of the shell. Here, too, the cord and detonator are formed into a composite unit or assembly at the time that the detonator is manufactured. In this assembly, the looped section of cord is said to provide improved initiation characteristics possibly due to increased confinement of the explosive core of a retal sheathed LEDC. In the cord detonator assembly of U.S. Patent 3,709t149, the cord is disposed outside a closed shell that contains an impact sensitive ignition composition, held, for example, in an empty primed rim fired or center fired rifle cartridge casing used as an ena closure for a detonator. The cord is external in its entirety to the closed interior of the detonator shell, and its end or side is in direct and abutting contact with the exterior surface of the primer end, thereby permitting utilization of either the side or end output of the cord for ignition. Another LEDC actuated delay detonator is described in Canadian Patent 627,435. This detonator has an impact or friction sensitive ignition charge abutting one side of a diaphragm that can be deformed by a weak blow. The end of a length of LEDC is to be crimped into the open end of the detonator shell with its end abutting the other side of the diaphragm. The ignition of the ignition charge by the detonation of the cord abutting the diaphragm occurs by impact or friction in a manner analogous to the blow given by the firing pin of a shot gun, in contrast to ignition by heat or flame. The diaphragm fits tightly in a pocket, and the latter similarly in the detonator shell.Although this detonator is said to be capable C assembix ith the cord in the field by crilcping, field assembly of such a detonator presents certai problems. The necessary abutment of the cord end against the diaphragm may not always be achieved in practice in the field owing to the vagaries associated with different handlers, the effects of weather, etc.Also, foreign material could enter the shell prior to insertion of the cord, preventing the necessary cord to diaphragm abutting relationship. Dislodgement of the diaphragm pocket unit also is a possibility. LEDC actuated delay detonators are also described in U.S. Patent 3,306,201, wherein the ignition composition also is actuated by percussion of the detonation stimulus from the cord against an imperforate partition. According to one aspect, the present invention provides an improved non electric delay detonator adapted to be actuated by a low energy detonating cord, preferably a cord having a core explosive loading of less than about 1 gram per meter of length, which detonator comprises a first tubular metal shell integrally closed at one end, the first shell containing, in sequence from the closed end a a base charge of a detonating explosive composition, e.g., pressed granular pentaerythiritol tetranitrate PETN b a priming charge of a heat sensitive detonating explosive composition, e.g., lead azide c a delay charge of an exothermic burning composition, e.g., a boron red lead mixture d a tubular rigid metal capsule nested within the first shell and having one open extremity and a closure at the other extremity provided with an axial orifice therethrough, the closure on the capsule being adjacent to the delay charge or to a tubular carrier containing the delay charge e a second tubular metal shell integrally closed at one end, the second shell being deformable and positioned coaxially within the first shell in a manner such as to produce a spacing between the side walls of the second shell and of the capsule, and between the closed end of the second shell and the closure on. the capsule and f a percussion sensitive ignition charge, e.g., a granular mixture of red lead, boron, and lead azide, in the spacing between the side walls of the second shell and of the capsule, and between the closed end of the second shell and the closure on the capsule, the ignition charge being in contact with the delay charge by virtue of the orifice in the closure on the capsule means being provided for sealing off the charges from the atmosphere and for preventing the venting of gases resulting from the burning of the ignition charge, an open cavity extending from one end to the other of the second shell for receiving a low energy detonating cord adapted by its detonation to produce a pressure pulse that causes the ignition of the ignition charge, and the cavity being provided with a cord retention means for holding the cord axially therein. A preferred cord retention means consists of one or more inwardly directed teeth or prongs formed on the inside wall of the second shell or, preferably, on the inner end of an open ended metal or plastic sleeve that frictionally engages the inside wall of the second shell. The detonator is a self contained, sealed unit adapted to be packaged, stored, and transported apart rorn the detonating cord which is used to actuate it. At the place of use it can be incorporated into a cord detonator assembly for initiating a X ting charge wherein an end section of a length of lo energy detonating cord is held coaxially in the cavity of the second shell by the cord retention means in a manner such that the plane that passes through the end of the cord within the cavity normal to the cord axis passes preferably also through the ignition charge or, if not, is axially spaced from the plane in which the boundary of the ignition charge lies by a distance no greater than about 2.5 millimeters. Brief Description of the Drawing In the accompanying drawing, which illustrates specific embodiments of the non electric delay detonator, and cord detonator initiating assembly of the invention, FIG. 1 is a longitudinal cross section of a delay detonator of the invention and FIG. 2 is a view in partial cross section of a delay detonator of the invention assembled with a low energy detonating cord for the actuation thereof. Detailed Description Referring to FIG. 1, 1 is a first tubular metal shell having one integrally closed end, 2 is a base charge of a detonating explosive composition, 3 is a priming charge of a heat sensitive detonating explosive composition, 4 is a delay carrier in the form of a heavy walled tube of rigid material containing an axial core 5 of a delay charge of an exothermic burninz composition, and 6 is a tubular rigid metal capsule nested within shell 1 in snug fit therein, capsule 6 having one open extremity 7, and a closed extremity 8 provided with an axial orifice 9. Closed extremity 8 of capsule 6 rests against adjacent delay carrier 4, core 5 being coaxial and in communication with orifice 9.A second tubular metal shell 10, which is deformable and also integrally closed at one end, is positioned coaxially within shell 1 with its closed end the innermost end in a manner such as to produce a spacing between the side walls of shell 10 and capsule 6, and between the closed end of shell 10 and the closed extremity 8 of capsule 6. A percussion sensitive ignition charge 11 is located in this spacing. Ignition charge 11 is in contact with the delay charge in core 5 by virtue of orifice 9. A deformable grommet or sleeve 12, e.g., one made of rubber or a plastic such as polyethylene, is sandwiched between shells 1 and 10 starting from their open ends and extending to the open extremity 7 of capsule 6. Open cavity 13, which extends from one end to the other of shell 10, acts as a well for the proper axial positioning of a detonating cord therein for the ignition of ignition charge 11. Located in cavity 13 is a cord retention means in the form of an open ended metal sleeve 14 that frictionally engages the inside wall of shell 10 and has cord gripping means 15, i.e., a number of inwardly directed prongs, formed on its inner end. While a cord can be inserted into cavity 13 through prong ended sleeve 14, the prongs prevent the motion of the cord in the opposite direction when tension is applied thereto.Sleeve 14 extends from the open end of shell 10 to a plane which will place the end of the gripped cord in a plane normal to the axis of shell 10 which is axially spaced from the plane in which the boundary 16 of ignition charge 11 lies by a distance no greater than about 2.5 millimeters regardless of how incompletely the cord may be pushed into the cavity. Preferably, the sleeve places the cord so that the cord end is axially spaced from the bottom of shell 10 by no more than about 5 millimeters. The outer end of metal sleeve 14 is provided with a lip portion 17 that extends over the ottrr ends of shell 10 and grommet 12. Crimp 18 locks shell 10 in place, keeping it from becoming dislodged by the internal pressure produced when charge 11 ignites.Grommet 12 and circumferential crimps 19 and 20 in the side of shell 1 seal charges 2, 3, 5, and 11 off from the atmosphere. Ignition charge 11 is one which is sensitive to ignition by a pressure pulse produced by the detonation of a low energy detonating cord positioned coaxially in cavity 13 in a manner such that it is gripped by prongs 15. The detonator is a self contained, sealed unit and can be stored, transported, and otherwise handled as required separated from the detonating cord with which it is designed to be used. At the time of use, the detonator can be assembled with the cord used to actuate it by inserting the cord into cavity 13 of shell 10 until it is gripped by prongs 15 and preferably becomes seated against the closed end of shell 10 as is shown in FIG. 2. Separation of the components of the detonator cord assembly until use offers such advantages as safety and convenience during handling and storage, possible separate classification of the components for transportation, etc. In the cord detonator assembly shown inFIG. 2, an end section of a length of lowenergy detonating cord 21 is in coaxial position in cavity 13 of shell 10 and has its end touching the closed end of shell 10. Prongs 15 grip cord 21 and thus prevent it from being pulled out of cavity 10. In this embodiment, the plane that passes through the end of cord 21 within cavity 10 normal to the cord axis also passes through ignition charge 11.Cord 21 consists of a continuous solid core 22 of a deformable bonded detonating explosive composition, e.g., superfinePETN admixed with a binding agent such as plasticized nitrocellulose core reinforcement means 23 consisting of a mass of filaments derived from multi filament yarns around and in contact with the periphery of core 22 parallel to the core s longitudinal axis and a protective plastic sheath 24, which encloses core 22 and core reinforcing filaments 23. Cords of this type are described in the aforementioned BelgianPatent 863,290, The use of the detonator and the cord detonator initiating assembly of the invention will now be described by way of an example. The detonator and cord are those shown in the drawing. Shell 1 is a standard detonator shell, e.g., a shell made of commercial bronze, 42 mm long, and having an external diameter of 7.3 mm and a wall and bottom thickness of 0.3 mm. Base charge 2 consists of 0.49 gram of PETN, which has been placed in shell 1 and pressed therein at 1220 1335 Newtons with a pointed press pin. Priming charge 3 is 0.14 gram of an 85 15 mixture by weight of dextrinated lead azide and the coarse lead salt of dinitrocresylate, this mixture having been loaded into the shell and pressed at the same pressure as the base charge by a flat pin.Delay carrier 4 is a 7 mm long swaged lead tube, and delay charge 5 is 0.2 gram of a 2 98 boron red lead mixture, grained with polysulfide rubber. The diameter of the axial core of carrier 4 is 2 mm. Capsule 6 is made of commercial bronze, is 11.1 mm long, and has a wall thickness of 0.6 mm.Axial orifice 9 is 2 mm in diameter. Capsule 6 is positioned over carrier 4 and pressed at 1220 1335 Newtons by a flat press pin. Ignition charge 11 is 0.08 gram of a 1.5 88.5 10 by weight boron red lead dextrinated lead azide mixture. Shell 10 is made of aluminum, and has a wall thickness of 0.56 mm, a bottom thickness of 0.64 mm, and an overall length of 19.8 mm. The outer diameter of shell 10 is 4.9 mm in a 6 mm long section starting at the closed end 5.6 mm in a 5 mm long section starting at the open end and 5.4 mm in an intermediate sectipn therebetween.Grommet 12, made of low density polyethylene and having a length of 9 mm, an outer diameter of 6.4 mm, and an inside diameter of 5.4 mm, is fitted onto shell 10 in a manner such that the edge surfaces of shell 10 and grommet 12 at the outer end are sub stantially coplanar. Bronze sleeve 14 has an overall length of 12 mm, an outer diameter of 4.5 mm, an inner diameter of 4 mm, and a 2.5 mm tapered portion having four cord gripping prongs 15, which reduce the diameter of the sleeve at the gripping end to 2 mm.Sleeve 14 is fitted into shell 10 in a manner such that lip portion 17 rests over the ends of shell 10 and grommet 12. The assembly of shell 10, grommet 12, and sleeve 14 is pressed into shell 1 at 222 267 ewtons, thereby compacting ignition charge 11 in the spacing between the closed end of shell 10 and closed extremity 8 of capsule 6, and displacing some of charge 11 into the annular space between the facing walls of shell 10 and capsule 6. Vibrating the assembly upside down also moves ignition charge 11 into the annular space. Charge 11 extends about the length 6 mm of the 4.9 mm outer diameter section of shell 10, as can be seen by X ray measurements, or b post firing observation of shell 10.The inner end of grommet 12 rests against the surface of capsule 6 at the capsule s open extremity 7, and prongs 15 terminate in a plane normal to the longitudinal axis of sleeve 14 that is axially spaced from the plane in which the boundary 16 of ignition charge 11 lies by a distance of about 1.8 mm. In this manner, even if cord 21 were inserted into cavity 13 to the extent that it were gripped by prongs 15 without being pushed to the bottom of the shell, which action, as a practical matter, would normally cause the cord to extend at least about 3 millimeters beyond prongs 15, leaving a 4.8 mm gap between the cord end and the bottom of the shell, a 1.2 mm end portion of the cord would be adjacent to charge 11, and the actuation of the ignition charge would be assured. Cord 21 has an outer diameter of 2.5 mar,, a 0.5 mm diameter core 22 , and a 0.6 mm thick lowdensity polyethylene sheath 24 . The core 22 consists of a mixture of 758 superfine PETN, 21 acetyl tributyl citrate, and 4 nitrocellulose prepared by the procedure described in U.S. Patent 2,992,087. The average particle size of the superfine PETN is less tan 15 microns, with all particles smaller than 44 microns. Core reinforcing filaments 23 are derived from eight 1000 denier strands of polyethylene terephthalate yarn substantially uniformly distributed on the periphery of core 22. The PETN loading in core 22 is 0.53 gram per meter. One end of a 7 meter length of cord 21 is inserted into cavity 13 of shell 10 as is described above. When cord 21 is detonated at its other end by a No. 6 blasting cap having its end in coaxial abutment with the exposed end of cord 21, or bv the detonation transmitted to it from another detonating cord, e.g., in the cord booster assembly described in ourco pending, European Patent Application No. 80300230.2 tlie detonator ires, giving a delay period of 40 mlljseconds. Yn operation, the detonation of core 22 causes shell 10 to expand and ignition cllarze 11 to be ignited as a result of being suddenly squee 2C z between shell 10 and capsule 6.The burning of ignition charge 11 ignites delay charge 5, which in turn ignites priming charge 3, causing base charge 2 to detonate. For use in the cord booster assembly of the aforementioned co pending application No. 80300230.2 the free end of cord 21 of the cord detonator assembly of this invention is inserted into the cavity of the booster shell as shown in the drawing of the co pending application. More specifically, cord 13 shown inFIGS. 2 and 3 of the co pending application is the same as cord 21 of this application. This cord is detonated by the detonation of a booster explosive, which in turn is detonated by a detonating cord positioned transversely outside and adjacent to the closed end of the shell containing the booster explosive. While the detonator of this invention can be adapted to be actuated by any low energy detonating cord, it is preferred that cords having a core explosive loading of less than about 1 gram per meter be used for this purpose, inasmuc h a s it is more difficult with heavier cords to maintain the sealed character of the detonator until after the delay charge has burned, a condition that is required if the predetermined delay timing is to be attained. Also, the type of cord described in the aforementionedBelgian patent is preferred because it would not be desensitized should its cut end come into contact with water, as could occur in field assembly. The particular compositions selected for the various charges in the detonator are nct critical to the present invention, provided that the selected compositions function in the specified manner. Thus, the composition selected to be used as the ignition charge has to be one which is ignitible by percussion, i.e., by the sudden impact of the expanding shell 10 while the charge is held within the rigid capsule 6 reliably propagates the initiation stimulus from the detonating cord to the delay charge 5 and is substantially gasless when it decomposes, to prevent rupture of the surrounding capsule. Preferred ignition compositions consist essentially, by weight, of at least about 86 red lead lead tetrox.ide , about from 1 to 2.58 boron, and up to about 11 lead azide, lead styphnate, or a mixture thereof.Certain of these compositions are described in U.S. Patent 3,306,201, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. More sensitive ignition compositions may be required in detonators to be used with detonating cords having smaller core loadings than in those used with cords having larger loadings. The exothermic burning composition used as the delay charge can be any of the gasless exothermlu reacting mixtures of solid oxidizing and reducing agents that burn at a constant rate and that are commonly used in ventless delay detonators. Examples of such mixtures are boron red lead, boron red leaddibasic lead phosphite, aluminum cupric oxide, magnesium barium peroxide seleium, and silicon reÅa lead. The delay charge may be present in the bore of a metal carrier, e.g., of lead, as is shown inFIG. 1, or it may be a simple layer adjacent to capsule 6 and the priming charge.The delay period is dependent upon the length or depth of the delay charge as well as its degree of compaction and confinement and therefore this charge usually will be compacted in a heavy walled carrier tube. The priming charge can be any heat sensitive detonating explosive composition which is readily initiated by the burning of the delay composition, e.g., lead azide, mercury fulminate, diazodinitrophenol, or a similar composition. The composition used for the base charge can be any of the conventional base charges, e.g., PETN, cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine, cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine, lead azide, picryl sulfone, nitromannite, TNT, and the like. This charge can be loose or compacted. The proper functioning of the detonator of this invention depends on a the expansion of shell 10 by the pressure pulse resulting from the detonation of a low energy detonating cord located in the cavity of shell 10 and, in turn, b on the ignition of ignition charge 11 as a result of the sudden compression caused by this expansion. The presence of the ignition charge in the annular spacing between the side walls of the expansion shell 10 and the capsule 6 is a means of assuring the ignition of the ignition charge should cord 21 fail to be seated against the closed end of shell 10. To provide this gap capability, i.e., the ability for firing the detonator when there is a spacing between the end of cord 21 and the closed end of shell 10, the thickness of the ignition charge wall spacing should be at least 0.2 mm. Conditions which lead to the collapse or rupture of shell 10 when charge 11 is ignited are to be avoided, otherwise the reproducibility of the delay period for a given delay charge may be deleteriously affected owing, for example, to a resulting decrease in internal pressure. Collapse and or rupture of shell 10 is avoided by selecting a proper combination of shell material and wall thickness, and ignition comtosition and charge thickness i.e., thickness of the spacing between the side walls of shell 10 and capsule 6 . For a given shell material and wall thickness, the thickness of a given ignition composition can be reduced to assure the integrity of the expansion shell.Alternatively, if a reduction in ignition charge thck ness is undesirable, e.g., to maintain gap capability, the wall thickness of the shell adjacent to the ignition charge can be increased to the extent that shell expansion is not severely compromised as a preventive measure against shell collapse. The outer diameter of expansion shell 10 is not critical provided that the annular spacing around it is sufficiently large to accommodate the required amount of ignition charge. If a single outer diameter of shell 10 is not suitable to accommodate a given size sleeve 14 and grommet 12, as well as the selected thickness of the annular portion of the ignition charge, the diameter of shell 10 can be varied along the length of the shell, as shown inFIG. 1. Because expansion shell 10 has to be deformable by the pressure pulse produced by the detonation of a low energy detonating cord, it preferably is made of a metal such as aluminut or brass, and preferably has a wall thickness no greater than about 0.8 mm in the region adjacent to the ignition charge. As has been mentioned previously, the presence of the ignition charge in the spacingbetween the walls of the expansion shell 10 and the capsule 6 permits the detonator to be fired even when the end of cord 21 is not seated against the closed end of shell 10. Because the cord is easily pushed into cavity 13 until it xeaches the closed end of shell 10, however, the cord detonator assembly usually, and preferably, will have the cord end touching the shell end. In the usual and preferred case, therefore, the plane that passes through the end of the cord within cavity 13 normal to the cord axis passes also through the ignition charge. At least about a 2.5 mm end portion of the cord preferably will be surrounded by the ignition charge whether the cord end touches the shell bottom or there is a gap between the two. With ignition charge surrounding at least a 2.5 mm endportion of the cord, the presence of foreign matter such as gritty particles in the gap between the cord end and the expansion shell bottom does not deleteriously affect the functioning of the detonator, a feature which is of great importance in a field assembled detonator where foreign matter could enter cavity 13 before cord 21 is inserted. The detonator will also function properly if there is an axial separation between the cord end and the ignition charge boundary, preferably a separation of no greater than about 2.5 mm. To overcome the variations possible in the location of the cord end relative to the ignition charge when the detonator and cord te assembled in the field, the position of sleeve 14 controls the proper positioning of the cord. The length of sleeve 14 is selected so that the axial distance between the plane normal to the sleeve s axis in which its inner end prongs 15 lies and the plane in which the boundary 16 of ignition charge 11 lies does not permit the axial spacing between the cord end and the charge boundary to exceed about 2.5 mm when the cord is just gripped by prongs 15 without further insertion. For example, if the axial distance between the prong ends and the charge boundary were no greater than about 5.5 mm, and if the cord were to be inserted into cavity 13 only to the extent that it were gripped by the prongs near the end of the cord without further pushing of the cord into the cavity, which action, practically speaking, would normally cause the cord to extend at least about 3 mm beyond the prongs, it would be impossible for the axial spacing between the cord end and the charge boundary to be more than about 2.5 mm. In the same manner, if the axial distance between the prong ends and the bottom of shell 10 were no greater than about 8 mm, the axial spacing between the cord end and the bottom of shell 10 could not exceed about 5 mm.
