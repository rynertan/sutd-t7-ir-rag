# Data recorder system.

## Abstract
A data recorder system in the form of an optical disk recorder in which the optical disk 4 , the drive spindle 6 and the disk drive motor 8 are moved or pivoted in an arcuate path relative to stationary laser optics 10 . When moved in such an arcuate path, the optical disk 4 , spindle 6 and drive motor 8 have a lessened movement of inertia compared to linear movement thereof which permits relatively fast accessing of an optical disk without a large drive motor. The accessing system can be naturally statically balanced by placing the spindle 6 and the drive motor 8 on opposite sides of the pivot point.
