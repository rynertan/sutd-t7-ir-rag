# Insulated skidrail.

## Abstract
An insulator 3 suitable for use with a truncated triangular shaped support member 2 or skid pipe having a base member 4, a pair of converging side member 6, 8 which terminate in an apex member 10 and a pair of shoulders 12 extending oppositely one another from the joinder of the apex member 10 and each corresponding side member. The insulator 3 includes a base unit 20 and a pair of converging side walls 22, 24. When slidingly received around the skid pipe 2, the insulator 3 closely conforms to the periphery of the base member 4 and side members 6, 8 of the skid pipe. The side walls 22, 24 of the insulator abut a lower lip 26 of each shoulder 12 so that molten slag and other impurities cannot migrate between the insulator and the skid pipe to degrade and dislodge the insulator. The insulator 3 is secured to the support member 2 by its novel geometry that is, when the insulator 3 is slidingly received around the structural member 2, the converging side walls 22, 24 of the insulator bear against the converging side members 6, 8 of the structural member 2 thereby maintaining the insulator 3 in proper position on the structural member 2.
