# SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR ION IMPLANTATION OF SEMICONDUCTOR WAFERS

## Abstract
A system 10 for scanning semiconductor wafers through an ion beam 14A . Ion beam line 14 generates an ion beam oriented in a prearranged direction. A scan wheel 15 carries a plurality of semiconductor wafers and a drive arrangement 22, 23 rotates the scan wheel about its central axis to scan the wafers across the ion beam in one coordinate direction. A scan arrangement 18, 19 produces relative scanning movement between the scan wheel and the ion beam in another coordinate direction. The scan wheel assembly 15 comprises a central hub 32 , a plurality of separate spoke arms 31 mounted to the hub, and a plurality of heat sink elements 15A formed on the outer ends of the spoke arms for mounting a semiconductor wafer thereon. The scan arrangement 18, 19 overscans the heat sink elements in and out of the ion beam so that the ion beam strikes only a portion of the spoke arms in one overscan position and the total heat load produced on the scan wheel assembly by the ion beam is substantially reduced. Tempor ary wafer clamps 49 and restraints 48 hold the wafer 80 on the heat sink until centrifugal force due to wheel spinning is sufficient to press the wafer on the heat sink. Congruent triangle mounting and drive arrangements for the scan wheel provide the 1 r velocity function for slow scan to achieve implant uniformity.
