## Description
TITLE POLY 1 BUTENE RESIN COMPOSITION This invention relates to a poly l butene resin composition. More specifically, it relates to a poly lbutene resin composition having excellent resistance and pressure resistant strength against cold or hot water having sterilizing chlorine dissolved therein. Metallic pipes such as zinc placed steel pipes, copper pipes and lead pipes have heretofore been used as pipes for supplying cold or hot water. The steel pipes have the defect that rust is formed to generate red or blcak water. The copper pipes have the defect that pin holes are generated owing to electrolytic corrosion, or blue water occurs as a result of rust formation. Hence, new piping materials have been desired. To some extent, plastic pipes such as pipes made of polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene and poly l butene which do not develop rust or pinholes owing to electrolytic corrosion have already come into practical use.In particular, poly l butene is now evaluated as one of the most suitable resins for water supply pipes because of its excellent pressure resistant strength, internal pressure creep durability at high temperatures, high and low temperature properties, abrasion resistance, and flexibility. like other synthetic resins, poly l butene also undergoes chemical degradation under the action of sterilizing chlorine added to city water, and tends to lose its inherent high performance. This tendency becomes especially pronounced in hot water supply pipes which are placed under high temperature and high pressure loads. To the best of the knowledges of the present inventors, there has not been known a poly l butene resin composition having excellent resistance to be referred to as chlorine water resistance to cold or hot water containing sterilizing chlorine dissolved therein to be referred to as chlorine water and excellent pressure resistant strength. It is an object of this invention therefore to provide a poly l butene resin composition having excellent chlorine water resistance. Another object of this invention is to provide a poly l butene resin composition having excellent chlorine water resistance and excellent pressure resistance in the state of being in contact with chlorine water to be referred to simply as pressure resistance . Still another object of this invention is to provide a poly l butene resin composition which has excellent surface luster and shows only a small extent of decrease in the degree of polymerization of the poly l butene polymer when it is kept in contact with chlorine water for a long period of time. A further object of this invention is to provide a poly l butene resin composition having excellent chlorine water resistance and pressure resistance which is suitable for use as a material for pipes used to supply cold or hot water having a minor amount of sterilizing chlorine dissolved therein. Other objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the following description. The objects and advantages of this invention are achieved by a resin composition comprising a poly l butene polymer and at least one hindered phenol selected from the group consisting of a 3, 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzoates of the following formulaEMI2.1 wherein R represents an alkyl group having l to 18 carbon atoms or an aryl group having 6 to 18 carbon atoms, b 1,3,5 trimethyl 2,4,6 tris 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl benzene, c 1,3,5 tris 4 tert butyl 3 hydroxy 2,6 dimethylbenzyl isocyanurate, d tris 3, 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl isocy anurate, e n octadecyl 3 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate, f a nickel salt of a monoethyl ester of bis 3,5 ditert butyl 4 hydroxybenzylphosphonic acid , g 2,2 dihydroxy 3,3 di a methylcyclohexyl 5,5 dimethyl diphenylmethane, h 4,4 thiobis 3 methyl 6 tert butyl phenyl , i 1,1, 3 tris 2 methyl 4 hydroxy 5 tert butyl phenyl butane, j tetrakis methylene 3 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxy phenyl propionateDmethane, and k 4,4 methylene bis 2,6 di tert butyl phenol . The hindered phenols a to k used in the present invention are compounds known as antioxidants or ultraviolet absorbers. Investigations of the present inventors have shown that while very many hindered phenols have been known heretofore, only the above specified compounds a to k can improve the chlorine water resistance or pressure resistance of poly l butene polymer to a fully satisfactory degree and other hindered phenols are useless for this purpose, although no clear reason has yet been assigned to it. The specific structures of the hindered phenols a to k used in this invention are shown below. a 3,5 Di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzoates These compounds are represented by the following formula I . EMI4.1 wherein R represents an alkyl group having 1 to 18 carbon atoms or an aryl group having 6 to 18 carbon atoms. In formula I above, the C1 C18 alkyl group may be linear or branched, and includes, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, hexadecyl and octadecyl.Examples of the C6 C18 aryl group are phenyl, naphthyl and diphenyl or alkyl substituted aryl groups resulting from the substitution of the above aryl groups by 1, 2 or 3 alkyl groups having 1 to 12 carbon atoms provided that the total number of carbon atoms in the substituted aryl groups does not exceed 18. Specific examples of the alkyl substituted aryl groups are 3,5 di tert butylphenyl, 2,6 ditert butylphenyl, 2,4 di tert butylphenyl, 2,4,6 tri tertbutylphenyl, 2, 6 dimethylphenyl, and 2, 6 di tert butyl 4 methylphenyl. Thus, examples of the 3,5 di tert butyl t hydroxy benzoates of formula I include methyl 3,5 di tert butyl4 hydroxybenzoate, propyl 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzoate, octyl 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzoate, dodecyl 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzoate, hexadecyl 3,5 di tert butyl benzo ate, 3,5 di tert butylphenyl 3, 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzoate, 2, 6 di tert butylpheny1 3, sdi tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzoate, 2,4,6 tri tert butylphenyl 3,5 di tertbutyl 4 hydroxybenzoate, 2,4 di tert butylphenyl 3,5 ditert butyl 4 hydroxybenzo ate, and 2, C dimethylphenyl 3, 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzo ate. b 1,3,5 Trimethyl 2,4,6 tris 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl benzene EMI5.1 In the above and subsequent formulae, t.Bu represents a tert butyl group. c 1,3,5 tris 4 tert Butyl 3 hydroxy 2,6 dimethyl benzyl isocyanateEMI5.2 d tris 3,5 Di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl iso cyanurate EMI6.1 e n Octadecyl 3 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionateEMI6.2 f Nickel salt of a monoethylester of bis 3,5 ditert butyl 4 hydroxybenzylphosphonic acid EMI6.3 g 2,2 dihydroxy 3,3 di alpha methylcyclohexyl 5,5 dimethyl diphenylmethaneEMI6.4 h 4,4 Thiobis 3 methyl 6 tert butylphenol EMI7.1 i 1,1,3 Tris 2 methyl 4 hydroxy 5 gert butyl phenyl butaneEMI7.2 j Tetrakis methylene 3 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydro xyphenyl propionate methane EMI7.3 k 4,4 Methylene bis 2,6 di tert butylphenol EMI7.4 The poly l butene polymer used in this invention is preferably a homopolymer of l butene, a copolymer of at least 90 mole of l butene and not more than 10 mole of another a olefin, or a mixture of at least 50 by weight of the above homopolymer or copolymer with not more than 50 by weight of another a olefin polymer. Examples of a olefins other than l butene are ethylene, propylene, 4 methyl l pentene, l hexene and l octene.The poly lbutene polymer used in this invention especially preferably has a melt flow rate to be abbreviated MFR of 0.1 to 50 g 10 minutes measured in accordance with ASTM D 1238N . The poly l butene polymers used in this invention and methods for their manufacture are described, for example, in the specifications of U.S. Patents Nos. 3197452, 3219645, 3362940, 3244685, 3356666, 3907761 and 3865902.The descriptions of these specifications are therefore incorporated herein as part of the specification of the present application. The poly l butene resin composition of this invention may contain 100 parts by weight of the poly l butene polymer and usually 0.05 to 2.0 parts by weight, preferably 0.1 to 1.0 part by weight, of at least one hindered phenol selected from the group consisting of a to k above.If the content of the hindered phenol is lower than the above specified lower limit, the extent of improvement of the chlorine water resistance of the poly l butene resin composition tends to be considerably small. A group of the hindered phenols a to k used in this invention give poly l butene resin compositions having improved chlorine water resistance and pressure resistant strength. Investigations of the present inventors have shown the above hindered phenols to be excellent in that the 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzoate a give the poly l butene resin composition of the invention which undergoes little degradation at its surface of contact with chlorine water when kept in contact with chlorine water, and the hindered phenols b to k give the poly l butene resin composition which has a relatively high degree of polymerization and little decreases in its degree of polymerization when kept in contact with chlorine water.InExamples given hereinbelow, the degradation of the contacting surface is evaluated by measuring the gloss of the resin surface, and the degree of polymerization, by measuring the solution viscosity of the resin composition. Preferably, the resin composition of this invention contains at least one 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxy benzoate a and at least one of the hindered phenols b to k . The resin composition of this invention desirably contains at least one of compounds 1 to n shown below. 1 2,6 di tert butyl p cresol EMI9.1 m tris 2,4 di tert butyl phenyl phosphiteEMI9.2 n tocopherol a , B , r or tocopherol, or a mixture of these The resin composition of this invention further containing at least one of the compounds 1 to n is superior in that it has a higher degree of polymerization than the resin composition of this invention not containing these compounds. The compounds 1 to n effectively prevent the poly l butene polymer from being degraded in the molten state by oxygen and heat when it is mixed with the hindered phenols a to k .The resin composition of this invention which further contains at least one compound from the group of 1 to n contains at least one of 1 to n in an amount of usually 0.01 to 1.0 part by weight, preferably 0.05 to 0.5 part by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the poly l butene polymer. When the content of the compound 1 to n is less than 0.01 part by weight, scarcely any effect is obtained of incorporating such a compound 1 to n . If, on the other hand, it exeeds 1.0 part by weight, there is a tendency to the formation of a resin composition having a reduced tensile yield stress. According to this invention, the resin composition further containing at least one of the compounds 1 to n preferably comprises at least one of the 3,3 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzoates a , at least one hindered phenol selected from the group consisting of the compounds b to k and at least one compound selected from the group of 1 to n or the compound b , the compound e , the compound i and at least one compound selected from the group of l to n . The aforesaid preferred resin compositions of this invention have improved chlorine water resistance both at the surface portion of a shaped articleand at the entire porting of a shaped article of resin, and exhibit reduced degradation of the polymer during molding. Various known methods can be used to mix the polyl butene polymer with the compounds a to n . For example, the individual ingredients are mixed by a ribbon blender or a Henschel mixer and then granulated by an extruder. Or they may be directly melted and mixed by a Banbury mixer, a kneader, a two roll mill, etc. and then granulated by an extruder As required, other ultraviolet absorbers, moldproof agents, rust inhibitors, lubricants, fillers, pigments, dyes, heat stabilizers, etc. may be incorporated in the poly l butene resin composition of this invention.Rust formation on melting and processing machines caused by the catalyst residue can be conveniently inhibited by using as the rust inhibitors a metal salt of a higher fatty acid, or a double compound of the general formula X Aly H 2x 3y 2z A z aH20 wherein M represents Mg, Ca or Zn, A respresents a divalent anion, x, y and z are positive numbers, and a is O or a positive number. Since the resin composition of this invention has excellent chlorine water resistance and pressure resistant strength, it can be conveniently used as a material for pipe systems adapted for supplying water having chlorine dissolved therein, for example tap water, or n potsble industrial water sterilized with chlorine. A water supply pipe may be molded from the poly l butene resin composition of this invention by, for example, melting the poly l butene polymer having incorporated therein at least one compound selected fro a to n at a temperature of 150 to 3000C in an extruder, extruding the molten mixture through a die, sizing the extrudate, cooling the extrudate with cooling water at a temperature of 5 to 50 C, and cutting or winding up the cooled product through a take up device. The extruder may generally be a single screw metering type extruder. The die may, for example, be of a straight head type, a cross head type or an offset type. The sizing may be carried out by a sizing plate method, an outside mandrel method, a sizing box method or an inside mandrel method.A pipe coupling joint may be molded by using a combination of an ordinary injection molding machine and a mold or a combination of a blow molding machine and a mold, and a hot water storage tank may be molded by using a combination of a blow molding machine and a mold, The poly l butene resin composition of this invention can be used widely in cold and hot water supply systems because it has improved chlorine water resistance while retaining superior pressure resistant strength, internal pressure creep durability at high temperatures, high and low temperature properties and abrasion resistance inherent to the poly l butene polymer. The following examples illustrate the present invention in greater detail. Example 1 One hundred parts by weight of poly l butene MFR 0.8 g 10 min.

The resulting pellets were melted for 10 minutes by a hot press at 2000 C, and then pressed by a cold press at 300 C for 3 minutes to form a press sheet having a thickness of 1 mm.test pieces, 10 mm x 150 mm in size, were cut off from the press sheet. Each test piece was set on a holder, and dipped in a vessel in which chlorine containing water having an effective chlorine concentration of 100 ppm and a temperature of 90 O was passed at a rate of 1 liter hour. The gloss angle of incident light 450 and 3 in decalin at 1350C of each test piece with the lapse of time were measured.
