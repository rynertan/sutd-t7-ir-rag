TITLE OF THE INVENTIONNEW l OXA l DETHIA CEPHALOSPORIN COMPOUNDS ANDANTIBACTERIAL AGENT COMPRISING THE SAMEDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a novel antibacterial l oxa l dethiacephalosporin compound. We, the present inventors, have made extensive researches in an attempt to seek for and to synthesize such a new cephalosporin compound which exhibits a wide range of antibacterial spectrum and which is active against a variety of resistant bacteria. As a result, the present inventors have now succeeded in preparing l oxa l dethiacephalosporin compounds which are effective as an antibacterial agent in therapeutic treatment of animals including man. Thus, the present inventors have succeeded in the synthesis of a l oxa l dethiacephalosporin compound of the general formula I EMI2.1 wherein R1is a group of the formula EMI2.2 where R4 is a methyl group or an ethyl group, orR1 is a group of the formula EMI2.3 where R5 is a hydrogen atom, a 4 ethyl 2,3dioxopiperazin l yl group or a 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic radical having 2 ring nitrogens as the sole hetero substituent in the ring and having at least one hetero group on the carbon adjacent to the ring nitrogens of the formula EMI3.1 and the carbon atom to which the asterisk is attached shows R configuration or S configuration or a mixture of these configurations both of R2 3 and R3 are each a hydrogen atom, or either one of R2 and R3 is a hydrogen atom and the other a methyl group.And, we have found that the l oxo l dethia cephalosporin compounds bearing a 2,5 dihydro 6 hydroxy 2 methyl 5 oxo 1,2,4 triazin 3 yl thiomethyl group at the 3 position thereof show a wide range of antibacterial activity against gram positive and gram negative bacteria, including a variety of resistant bacteria, and that these compounds exhibit an excellent activity as an antibacterial agent when administered intramuscwlarly or intravenously to the animals. Japanese patent application first publication KOKAI No. 154980 80 discloses such cephalosporin compounds which have at the 3 position thereof a 2,5 dihydro 6 hydroxy 2 methyl 5 oxo l,2,4 triazin 3 yl thiomethyl group, but this first publication has no description in respect of the l oxa l dethia cephalosporin compounds. The compounds of the formula I mentioned above are thus novel compounds.

Improved duration of the compound concentration in blood as described above is an important factor by which the antibacterial activity in vitro can be developed in vivo. According to a second aspect of this invention, therefore, there is provided an antibacterial agent which comprises at least one of a l oxa l dethia cephalosporin compound represented by the aforesaid general formula I , and a non toxic hydrate, a non toxic salt or a non toxic ester of said compound as the active ingredient. Non toxic salt, that is, the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound of general formula I includes conventional non toxic salts carboxylate which may be formed by reaction of the carboxyl group present in said compound with a base, especially such salts with an inorganic base, for example, alkali metal salts such as sodium or potassium salt and alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium, magnesium or zinc salt such addition salts with a basic amino acid, for example, lysine, arginine, ornithine or histidine and such addition salts with an organic amine salt or other basic salts which will normally form a salt with cephalosporin.

The non toxic esters of the compound I according to this invention include those of the carboxyl group present in said compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable ester forming group.Among them are preferred such metabolically unstable esters, which carry an ester forming group cleavable upon hydrolysis in vivo. Examples of such ester forming group include acetoxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl, a ethoxycarbonyloxyethyl, phthalidyl and phenyl groups and the like. For use as antibacterial agent, the compound I of this invention may be given orally or parenterally to adult at a unit dosage of 50 to 1500 mg and preferably of 100 to 1000 mg once to five times per day when it is administered for therapeutic treatment of bacterial infections in man. The antibacterial agent according to this invention may usually be composed of the compound of this invention in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as a solid or liquid excipient, and it may be formulated into solid preparations such as tablets, capsules, powder and pre treated powder, or into liquid preparations such as injectable solution, intravenous drip solution, suspension and syrup. Solid or liquid excipient used for this purpose may be any one known in this field of the art. As stated above, the preparations so formed may preferably contain the compound of this invention at an amount required for the unit dosage of the compound for adult indicated above. The compound I according to this invention may be produced, for example, by reacting a l oxa l dethia cephem compound of the general formula IIa EMI16.1 wherein both of R2 and R3 are each a hydrogen atom, or either one of R2 and R4 is a hydrogen atom and the other a methyl group, R6 is a carboxyl protecting group, and X is a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom, with a carboxylic acid of the general formula III R1COOH III wherein R1 is as defined in the general formula I hereinbefore, or with a functional derivative thereof, to give a 7 N acylation product of the general formula IV EMI16.2 wherein Rl, R2, R3, R6 and X are as defined above, and reacting the resultant 7 N acylated compound of the formula IV with 2,5 dihydro 6 hydroxy 2 methyl 5 oxo 3 mercapto l,2,4 triazin of the formula V EMI17.1 preferably in the presence of a base which acts as binding agent of hydrogen halide, for example an alkyl amine, to give a compound of the general formula VI EMI17.2 wherein R1, R2, R3 and R6 are as defined hereinabove, followed by removal in a conventional manner of the remaining protecting groups from the resultant compound of the formula VI above. The steps in the process for the synthesis of the compound of the general formula I from the compound of the general formula II are described below In order to introduce a desired acyl group to the 7 amino group of the compound it , the compound of the formula II is at first reacted with the carboxylic acid of the formula III to effect the acylation on the 7 amino group, and thereby to obtain the 7 N acylated product of the formula IV .This acylation reaction may be carried out in a conventional manner known per se. The carboxylic acid of the formula III may preferably be used in the form of a functional derivative of said carboxylic acid such as an acid halide, an active acid ester, an acid anhydride or a mixed acid anhydride thereof. The acylation reaction may also be performed using the carboxylic acid of the formula III which has not been activated as above, when the reaction may be carried out by a dehydration condensation method with carbodiamido or by a phosphorous oxychloride method. The acylation may generally be performed in an organic solvent which is inert to the reaction such as dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, methylene chloride, chloroform or ethyl acetate, at a temperature of 500C to 500C. Next, the 7 N acylated product of the formula IV is reacted with 2,5 dihydro 6 hydroxy 2 methyl 5 oxo 3 mercapto l,2,4 triazin V as the reagent to introduce a desired substituent for the 3 halogen atom, whereby to obtain the compound VI . This replacement reaction at the 3 position is itself a known reaction which is disclosed in the specification of Japanese patent application first publication KOKAI No. 154980 80. The compounds IV and V are mixed with each other in an inert organic solvent, preferably in dimethylformamide DMF , dimethylacetoamide or dioxane, at OOC to 800C to effect the reaction. In case the compound of the formula IV where X is a chlorine atom, 1 2 equivalent of sodium iodide NaI may preferably be added to the reaction system to ensure that the reaction proceeds in a higher yield. Removal of the remaining protecting group from the compound VI gives the compound of the general formula I according to this invention. The protecting groups which are remaining in the compound VI are the carboxyl protecting group on the 4 carboxyl group and the amino protecting group on the 2 amino group of the 2 aminothiazol side chain at the 7 position of the 1 oxacepham ring. These protecting groups may be removed successively or simultaneously in a conventional manner. In caseR6 is a diphenylmethyl group or p nitrobenzyl group and 2 amino group of the 2 aminothiazol moiety has been protected with trityl group, these protecting groups are removed simultaneously by such a method as catalytic reduction or hydrolysis with an acidic reagent.The deprotection reaction for this purpose is known and performed in a conventional manner using an acidic reagents, for example, a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid, an organic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, or a Lewis acid such as aluminum chloride. The compound of the general formula IIa employed as a starting material for the process of producing the compound I of this invention may be prepared by the following reaction flow sheet EMI20.1 In this reaction flow sheet, R2, R , R and X denote the same meaning as defined hereinbefore. The compound of the formula VII which is used as a starting material for the preparation of the compound IIa showm in the above reaction flow sheet and in which either one of RÚ and Rê is a methyl group may be synthesized according to the method as disclosed in Japanese patent application first publications KOKAI No. 46287 84 and No.51291 84 each invented by some of the present inventors. The compound VII where R1 and R2 each is a hydrogen atom is a known compound which is disclosed in Japanese patent application first publications KOKAI No. 3088 79 and No. 25551 78.In these Formulas in the reaction flow sheet shown above, R6 is a carboxyl protecting group which may generally be used for penicillins, cephalosporins and l oxa l dethiacephalosporins. These carboxylprotecting groups may preferably be an alkyl group such as l butyl group, dichloroethyl group and trichloroethyl group and an aralkyl group such as benzyl group, p nitrobenzyl group, p methoxybenzyl group, phenacylmethyl group and diphenylmethyl group. Among these protecting groups, preferred are ones which are easily removed under a reductive condition, for example, diphenylmethyl group and p nitrobenzyl group. In the first step for the preparation of the compound IIa , the starting compound VII is formylated so that the 7 amino group is protected and the compound VIII is formed. This formylation reaction may be carried out in a conventional manner, when it is convenient to use a mixture of formic acid and . acetic anhydride or an active ester of formic acid, preferably trichlorophenylester of the formula EMI22.1 Thus, the 7 N formylated product VIII is obtained.Solvents used in the formulation may be an ordinary organic solvent, particularly an inert organic solvent which may preferably be methylene chloride, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and the like. In the next 2nd step, the 3 N methyltetrazol group of the compound VIII is reductively removed to give the 3 methyleno l oxacepham compound of the formula IX . The reduction may be carried out at 50C to 500C in an inert solvent in the presence of an organic or inorganic acid as the hydrogen source and using a metal powder such as zinc, iron, magnesium and the like. The reduction is preferably performed in methylene chloride or dioxane using zinc or magnesium in the presence of formic acid or acetic acid. In the 3rd step, the compound IX is treated with a halogenating agent to give a corresponding 3 halogenomethyl compound X . Such compound of the formula X where either of R2 andR3 is a methyl group is a novel compound, while usual cephalosporin compound and such compound of the formula X where R2 and R3 each is a hydrogen atom are known compounds. The halogenation of the compounds IX may be performed according to the halogenation procedure as described in Journal of American Chemical Society , 99, 2822 1977 , and Tetrahedron , 39, No. 15, 2515 2526 1983 . For the halogenation, the compound IX may be reacted with bromine or iodine, preferably in the presence of organic base DBU to give a 3 bromomethyl compound X X Br and a 3 iodomethyl compound X X I , respectively.A 3 chloromethyl compound X X C1 may be obtained by reacting the compound IX with phenylselenyl chloride, followed by oxidative deselenylation of the resultant 3 phenylseleno loxacepham compound. In the fourth step, the formyl group for the 7 amino protecting group of the compound X is removed to give the compound of the formula I Ia . Deformulation by acid treatment is a well known reaction, and to this end anhydrous hydrochloric acid is preferred to ensure that the deformulation can be performed selectively without affecting the other protecting group which is present in the molecule and unstable to the acid, that is, the protecting group for the 4 carboxylic group of said compound X . The deformulation may be carried out with 2 8 equivalents of anhydrous hydrochloric acid in an inert solvent at a temperature of 50C to 200 C. Depending on the procedure employed after the deformulation reaction, the compound of the general formula IIa is isolated either in the form of its free base or in the form of its hydrochloride.
