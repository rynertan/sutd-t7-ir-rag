# Organomagnesium solutions of low viscosity and process for their obtention.

## Abstract
A low viscosity liquid solution is described, comprising a a hydrocarbon soluble dialkylmagnesium compound of 4 to 20 carbon atoms per molecule. b a solvent selected from the group consisting of aliphatic, alicyclic, and aromatic hydrocarbons of 5 to 20 carbon atoms, and c an organometallic additive selected from the group con sisting of R₃Ga, R₃ In, and RLi, in which R is C₁ C₁₂ alkyl or C₅ C₇ cycloalkyl. Also disclosed is a method of preparing such a solution by in situ generation of the dialkylmagnesium compound via the reaction between metallic magnesium and the appropri ate alkyl halide in the presence of both the solvent and the organometallic additive.
