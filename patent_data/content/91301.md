# Rust removal process.

## Abstract
Rust removed from metal surfaces by applying a coating of an aqueous solution of copolymer of maleic acid and monomer. The rust becomes incorporated into the coating during drying and the coating detaches itself from the metal surface without the necessity of peeling or otherwise mechanically removing the rust laden coating.
