# IMAGE SENSOR MANUFACTURING METHOD

## Abstract
In a method of manufacturing image sensors, an electrode layer 2A of an opaque metal material is formed on a transparent ceramic substrate 1 and is patterned into individual electrodes 2 1, 2 2, 2 3 in photoengraving pro cess. An amorphous semiconductor layer 3A is deposed over the electrodes 2 1, 2 2, 2 3 formed on the substrate 1 and a common electrode 4 is formed on the amorphous semiconductor layer 3A . The amorphous semiconductor layer 3A is exposed with light rays through the substrate 1 so that each portions of the layer 3A which is located above surface regions of the substrate 1 between the electrodes regions of the substrate 1 between the electrodes 2 1, 2 2, 2 3 have high electric resistance.
