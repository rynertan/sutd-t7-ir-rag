## Description
The present invention relates to a silver halide photographic material and, more particularly, to one that has high stability and is free from any increase in graininess and which hence is capable of producing an image of high quality. Couplers based on 5 pyrazolone compounds are extensively used for forming magenta dye images in silver halide color photographic materials. The 5 pyrazolone couplers however have an unwanted absorption in the yellow at about 430 nm and such secondary absorption sometimes causes color contamination. With a view to solving this contamination problem, 1H pyrazolo 3,2 C S triazole type couplers i.e., couplers made of 1H pyrazolo 3,2 C S triazole derivatives have been proposed in U.S. Patent No. 3,725,067, British Patent Nos. 1,252,418 and 1,334,515, and Unexamined Published Japanese Patent Application Nos. 99437 1984 and 228252 1984. Couplers of this type are substantially free from the unwanted secondary absorption and, hence, are capable of eliminating the color contamination problem. Some couplers, if placed together with formalin which is used in household furniture for pest control purposes , will experience decreases in density, but the 1H pyrazolo 3,2 C S triazole type couplers undergo minimum decreases in density in the formalin atmosphere. In addition to this advantage in terms of storage stability, these couplers have high sensitivity. In spite of these advantages, however, the 1H pyrazolo 3,2 C S triazole type couplers may sometimes experience undesirable variations in photographic characteristics such as increased fog density and varied sensitivity if the conditions of developing solutions are disturbed by, for example, variations in pH, agitation, or changes in the pH of the developing agent. It has also been found that these disturbances sometimes cause adverse effects on the image quality by increasing the graininess of the image. With a view to solving these problems, the present inventors proposed a new technique in Japanese Patent Application No. 193609 1984 but the results were not completely satisfactory. The principal object, therefore, of the present invention is to provide a silver halide photographic material which is stabilized against variations in the conditions of development and is capable of producing a high quality image with a minimum increase in graininess and which yet retains the inherent advantages of a 1H pyrazolo 3,2 C S triazole type coupler i.e., absence of color contamination and high stability to noxious gases such as those emitted from formalin . The present inventors found that the aforementioned object could be attained by employing specified silver halide grains in the 1H pyrazolo 3,2 C S triazole type coupler. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of this finding. The silver halide photographic material of the present invention has one or more silver halide emulsion layers on a support, and the emulsion in at least one of said silver halide emulsion layers contains at least one pyrazole type magenta coupler which photographic material is characterized in that said emulsion contains silver halide grains which have a 110 plane and or a crystal plane having an edge running through substantially the center of a 110 plane, the silver halide composition of said grains being substantially made of silver bromide and or silver iodobromide and as the said pyrazole type coupler at least one of the following general formula I where Z represents a group of the non metallic atoms necessary for forming a nitrogen containing hetero ring which may have a substituent X is a hydrogen atom or a substituent which is capable of being eliminated upon reaction with the oxidation product of a color developing agent and R is a hydrogen atom or a substituent. The silver halide grains incorporated in emulsion in the silver halide photographic material of the present invention may be grains having a 110 plane in terms of the Miller indices, or a crystal plane having an edge running through substantially the center of a 110 plane said crystal plane is hereunder referred to as a semi 110 plane , or both said semi 110 plane and a 110 plane. The grains may be normal crystals or twins including multi twins so long as they have such planes on their outer surfaces. Morphologically, the grains may belong to one of the following groups 1 to 4 , provided that they satisfy at least one of the requirements 1 and 2 . The semi 110 plane as defined in the present invention is hereunder described with reference to the accompanying drawings. Fig. 10 shows the general shape of a typical silver halide grain having semi 110 planes which are indicated at 2. Fig. 11 is a partial plan view including a 110 plane 1 the rhombic face defined by the dashed line as seen in the direction perpendicular to that plane. Figs. 12 and 13 are front and side views, respectively, of Fig. 11. In Figs. 12 and 13, the numeral 3 denotes the central edge on the 110 plane 1, and 2 represents a semi 110 plane. The direction in which the edge runs through the center of a 110 plane is not limited to the embodiments shown in Figs. 10 to 13, and the two semi 110 planes having the common edge form a roof at an angle exceeding 110 degrees, as illustrated in Figs. 14 to 17. In accordance with the present invention, the silver halide grains in an emulsion in the light sensitive material are substantially composed of silver bromide or silver iodobromide, and the term substantially allows for the possibility that the grains may contain silver chloride or other silver halide compositions not included within the category of silver bromide and or silver iodobromide to the extent that they will not be detrimental to the objects of the present invention. It should however be noted that the total proportion of silver halides other than silver iodide is desirably not more than 10 mol . The proportion of silver iodide in the silver halide grains preferably ranges from 0 to 20 mol , more preferably from 0 to 15 mol . For incorporation in a photographic light sensitive material, the silver halide grains in accordance with the present invention preferably assume a core shell structure, with the silver halide composition being substantially made of silver iodobromide. In one preferable example, the silver halide grains are each composed of a core having a silver halide composition containing 3 40 mol of silver iodide, and a shell over said core which has a silver halide composition containing 0 10 mol of silver iodide, with the silver iodide content of the shell being smaller than that of the core by a degree of 2 30 . The silver iodide content of the core may change to that of the shell in any fashion, e.g., continuously or abruptly. Part of the core e.g., the part corresponding to the seed employed in grain preparation may be free of any silver iodide. The shell is preferably thin so as not to mask the desirable properties of the core but should be thick enough to hide its undesirable properties. More specifically, the silver halide grains preferably have a shell thickness within the range of 0.01 to 0.3 µm. The size of the silver halide grains is not limited to any particular value but, preferably, it is within the range of 0.1 to 3.0 µm, which is sufficient for attaining the objects of the present invention in an effective manner. For the purposes of discussion hereinafter, the size of a silver halide grain is defined by the length of one side of an equivalent cube which has the same volume as the grain. The silver halide grains in accordance with the present invention are prepared and used in the form of an emulsion where they are dispersed in a dispersion medium, typically gelatin. The particle size distribution of the grains in a group may be mono or polydispersed, or a mixture thereof. A proper mode of size distribution may be selected depending upon the use and other factors, but substantially monodispersed grains are preferable. In a preferred embodiment, at least 70 of all the silver halide grains in a silver halide emulsion layer in the light sensitive material of the present invention is made up of the core shell type grains described above. It is particularly preferable that all of the silver halide grains in an emulsion layer have a core shell structure. The core shell type silver halide grains in accordance with the present invention may be used independently or, more preferably, with two or more silver halide grains having different average sizes being mixed in appropriate proportions. It is also preferable that two or more core shell type silver halide grains having different silver iodide contents are used in combination. In preparing the silver halide grains of the present invention, it is preferable that the pAg of the emulsion is controlled to lie between 8.0 and 9.5 for a certain period of the step where a solution of a water soluble silver salt is mixed with a solution of a water soluble halide in the presence of a protective colloid, thereby producing the silver halide grains.

Usable magenta couplers are specifically described in, for example, Unexamined Published Japanese Patent Application Nos. 111631 1974, 29236 1981 and 94752 1982 Japanese Patent Publication No. 27930 1973 U.S. Patent Nos. 2,600,788, 3,062,653, 3,408,194 and 3,519,429 and Research Disclosure No. 12443. Examples of the colored magenta coupler that may be incorporated in the green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer together with the magenta coupler of the present invention are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,801,171 and 3,519,429 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 27930 1973. The magenta coupler of the present invention and other types of couplers are preferably used in amounts ranging from 2 x 10 The silver halide emulsion used in the present invention may be a polydispersed emulsion wherein the grains have a board range of average size distribution but, more preferably, the emulsion is monodispersed. The silver halide emulsion of the present invention may be used either independently or in combination with other types of emulsions, provided that the emulsion of the present invention is employed in an amount of less than 30 mol of the total amount of the emulsions used. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a mixture of two or more types of monodispersed silver halide grains may be incorporated in at least one of the blue , green and red sensitive silver halide emulsion layers. The two or more types of monodispersed silver halide grains may have the same or different average sizes. If desired, polydispersed silver halide grains may be used in combination with the monodispersed grains. The light sensitive material of the present invention may assume the normal arrangement of the light sensitive emulsion layers. Particularly good results are obtained if the emulsion layers are arranged in the reverse order see, for example, Japanese Patent Application Nos. 193609 1984 and 202065 1984 filed by the applicant of subject application . With the normal arrangement of emulsion layers, it has so far been difficult to prevent the photographic characteristics e.g., graininess from varying as a result of changes in the conditions of development e.g., pH , but the magenta coupler of the present invention is highly effective in avoiding such problems. Each of the light sensitive silver halide emulsion layers used in the present invention may be divided into two or more layers having different degrees of sensitivity. An illustrative arrangement consists, in order from the side farthest from the support, of a highly blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer BH , a less blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer BL , a highly green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer GH , a less green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer GL , a highly red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer RH , and a less red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer RL . Another possible arrangement consists, in order from the side farthest from the support, of a highly blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer BH , a highly green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer GH , a highly red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer RH , a less blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer BL , a less green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer GL , and a less red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer RL . The silver halide grains present in the BH, GH and RH in these layer arrangements, especially in the second arrangement, preferably have an average particle size of 0.40 3.00 µm, more preferably 0.50 2.50 µm. The silver halide grains present in the BL, GL and RL in the two layer arrangements, especially in the second arrangement, have an average particle size which preferably ranges from 0.20 to 1.50 µm, more preferably from 0.20 to 1.0 µm. If each of the BL, GL and RL is further divided into a layer of medium sensitivity and a layer of lowest sensitivity, the silver halide grains present in the former layer preferably have an average size of 0.30 1.50 µm while the grains in the latter layer preferably have an average size of 0.15 1.00 µm. The monodispersed silver halide grains present in the blue , green and red sensitive silver halide emulsion layers are such that most of the grains look alike in shape when the emulsions are observed under an electron microscope and that the grains are uniform in size and have such a size distribution that the value of s The grain size distribution of silver halide grains may be determined by the method described in Trivelli and Smith, The Empirical Relationships Between Sensitometric Distribution and Grain Size Distribution in Photography , The Photographic Journal, LXXIX, 330 338, 1949. A mixture of two or more monodispersed emulsions may be incorporated in each of the layers of lowest sensitivity. The silver halide emulsions used in the present invention may be chemically sensitized with activated gelatin, a sulfur sensitizer e.g., allyl thiocarbamide, thiourea or crystine , a selenium sensitizer, a reduction sensitizer e.g., stannous salts, thiourea dioxide or polyamines , a noble metal sensitizer such as a gold sensitizer e.g., potassium aurithiocyanate, potassium chloroaurate, or 2 aurothio 3 methylbenzothiazolium chloride or water soluble salts of other noble metals such as ruthenium, palladium, platinum, rhodium and iridium e.g., ammonium chloropalladate, potassium chloroplatinate and sodium chloropalladate , some of which will act eigher as sensitizers or as anti foggants depending on the amount in which they are used. These chemical sensitizers may be used either independently or in combination an illustrative combination is that of a gold sensitizer and a sulfur sensitizer, or that of a gold sensitizer and a selenium sensitizer . The silver halide emulsions in accordance with the present invention may be chemically ripened by addition of a sulfur containing compound, with at least one hydroxytetrazaindene compound and at least one nitrogenous heterocyclic compound containing a mercapto group being optionally incorporated in the emulsions either prior to, during or after the chemical ripening.

The present invention is hereunder described in greater detail with reference to the following specific examples, to which however the possible embodiments of the invention are by no means limited. In the following examples, the amounts of ingredients in a silver halide photographic material are expressed in terms of the value per square meter, unless otherwise noted. The amounts of silver halide and colloidal silver are indicated in terms of silver. The following explanation starts with the description of the emulsions for use in a green sensitive layer in the light sensitive material prepared in accordance with the present invention the explanation then proceeds to comparative emulsions and ends with the description of the results obtained by using the respective samples of photographic light sensitive material. The emulsions intended for use in a green sensitive layer in the light sensitive material of the present invention were prepared by the following procedures. Using the seven solutions A 1 to G 1 for their compositions, see below , core shell type silver iodobromide emulsions, EM 1 and EM 2, having a silver iodide content profile of 15 mol , 5 mol and 0.3 mol from the center outward were prepared. The seed emulsion was a monodispersed silver iodobromide emulsion having a silver iodide content of 2.6 mol which contained grains with an average size of 0.8 µm and a coefficient of variation of 11 in the grain size distribution. The coefficient of variation is a parameter indicating the degree of dispersibility of grains and may be defined as follows Two octahedral emulsions, EM 5 and EM 6, comprising silver iodobromide grains with 4 mol silver iodide with an average size of 1.6 µm were prepared in accordance with the description in Unexamined Published Japanese Patent Application No. 14829 1983. The emulsion EM 5 comprised core shell type silver iodobromide grains having a silver iodobromide AgI 0.3 mol shell coat with a thickness of 0.2 µm EM 6 contained silver iodobromide grains having a uniform distribution of silver iodide in the absence of a silver bromide shell. A twinned emulsion EM 7 comprising silver iodobromide grains 4 mol silver iodide having an average size of 1.6 µm was prepared in accordance with the description in Japanese Patent Publication No. 1417 1976. Emulsions EM 1 to EM 7 were prepared they were the same as EM 1, EM 2, EM 5, EM 6, EM 7, EM 3 and EM 4 the last two will be described hereinafter , respectively, in terms of the composition and crystal habit of silver halide grains except that the emulsion grains in EM 1 to EM 7 had an average size of 0.8 µm. In the samples of photographic material which were subsequently prepared see below , the emulsions EM 1 to EM 7 having an average grain size of 1.6 µm were incorporated in highly green sensitive layers GH while the emulsions EM 1 to EM 7 having an average grain size of 0.8 µm were incorporated in less green sensitive layers GL . Using the emulsions thus prepared, samples of light sensitive material were subsequently made in accordance with the present invention, and comparative samples were also made. At 50 C, solutions E 1 and B 1 were added simultaneously to solution A 1 by the double jet method with a mixer agitator of the type shown in Unexamined Published Japanese Patent Application Nos. 92523 1982 and 92524 1982. Solution G 1 was added simultaneously with completion of the addition of B 1, and D 1 was added simultaneously with completion of the addition of C 1. During the addition of solutions E 1 and B 1 by the double jet method, the pAg and pH of the mixture were controlled by supplying varying amounts of solutions F 1 and G 1 with a variable flow rate roller tube pump. Two minutes after completion of the addition of solution E 1, the pAg of the mixture was adjusted to 10.4 by addition of F 1, and 2 more minutes later, the pH was adjusted to 6.0 by addition of G 1. A comparative silver iodobromide emulsion, EM 3, comprising non core shell type grains with a silver iodide content of 7 mol was prepared using the five solutions, A 2, B 2, E 2, F 2 and G 2, having the compositions indicated below. Emulsion EM 4 was prepared in accordance with the present invention using the same five solutions. Each of EM 3 and EM 4 was prepared from a monodispersed seed silver iodobromide emulsion having a silver iodide content of 3.7 mol the nuclear grains in each emulsion had an average size of 0.8 µm and a coefficient of variation of 12 in the grain size distribution. At 50 C, solutions E 2 and B 2 were added to solution A 2 by the double jet method with a mixer agitator of the same type as used before. During the addition of E 2 and B 2 by the double jet method, the pAg and pH of the mixture were controlled by supplying varying amounts of solutions F 2 and G 2 with a variable flow rate roller tube pump. Two minutes after completion of the addition of solution E 2, the pAg of the mixture was adjusted to 10.4 by addition of F 2, and two minutes later the pH was adjusted to 6.0 by addition of G 2. The mixture was desalted and washed by routine methods. After dispersing the washed mixture in an aqueous solution containing 127 g of ossein gelatin, distilled water was added to make a total volume of 3,000 ml. The emulsion grains in each of EM 1, EM 2, EM 3 and EM 4 had an average size of 1.6 µm and a coefficient of variation of 11 in the grain size distribution. Details of the core shell structure possessed by the silver halide grains in each of the four emulsions are shown in Table 3.

This was a gelatin layer containing 0.23 g of gelatin, poly methyl methacrylate particles 2.5 µm in diameter and a dispersion of the following ultraviolet absorbers, UV 1 and UV 2 The gelatin solution in Layer 9 was prepared by preliminary treatment pH, 6.5 63 C 60 min of a 10 aqueous solution of medium viscosity gelatin with a gelatin hardener H 1 to be described hereinafter. Each of the layers 1 to 9 also contained a gelatin hardener H 2, to be described hereinafter and a surfactant. The samples of photographic material thus prepared using the emulsions and magenta coupler compounds listed in Table 4 1 were exposed under white light through an optical wedge and subsequently developed by either one of the procedures 1 to 3, which were identical with each other except that the pH of the color developer was varied as follows The scheme used to process the samples was as follows. The working solutions had the following compositions. The emulsions and magenta couplers incorporated in the layers, GL and GH, in each of the samples are listed in Table 4 1. The fog, sensitivity and gamma data for the samples which were developed by one of the procedures 1 to 3 are given in Table 4 2. As the data in Table 4 2 show, the samples of photographic material prepared in accordance with the present invention were highly stabilized against variations in the pH of the developing solution no abnormal phenomenon occurred in these samples even when they were developed at varying pHs and, in addition, they experienced minimum changes in sensitivity and gamma values. It is therefore clear that the present invention provides a photographic light sensitive material which is stable against variations in the conditions of development. Sample Nos. 2 1 to 2 9 having the following layer arrangement were prepared as in Example 1. The emulsions and magenta couplers incorporated in Layers 3 and 8 in Sample Nos. 2 1 to 2 9 were the same as those used in Sample Nos. 1 to 9 prepared in Example 1. The so prepared samples were subjected to color development by one of the following procedures 4 to 6 which were the same as procedure 2 employed in Example 1 pH, 10.02 except that the concentration of the color developing agent, 4 amino 3 methyl N β hydroxyethyl aniline sulfate, was varied as shown below. The resulting color images were evaluated for their sensitometric properties and graininess. The other conditions of color development were the same as in Example 1. The results of the evaluations are summarized in Table 5. Sample Nos. 2 1 to 2 9 were exposed under white light through an optical wedge under the same conditions and subsequently processed photographically. The data for variations in the gamma of the green sensitive layers in the color image formed in each sample are also shown in Table 5. As is clear from Table 5, the present invention is capable of providing a photographic light sensitive material that produces a high quality image without experiencing deteriorated sensitometric properties or increased graininess even if variations occur in the developing solution employed. In accordance with the present invention, a photographic light sensitive material is provided that is stabilized against variations in the conditions of development and is capable of producing a high quality image with a minimum increase in graininess and which yet retains the inherent advantages of the 1H pyrazolo 3,2 C S triazole type magenta coupler, such as the absence of color contamination and high stability to noxious gases such as those emitted from formalin.
