# ZEOLITE SYNTHESIS

## Abstract
The present invention elates to a method for synthesizing porous crystalline zeolite molecular sieves by first preparing a particular zeolite forming reaction mixture comprising among other conventional components an alumina source which allows only a gradual release of aluminum or aluminate ions into the reaction mixture as a result of its limited solubil ity in the reaction mixture. Zeolites produced in this manner can have unique structure and or crystal morphology and possess especially desirable catalytic properties when used to promote catalytic conversion of organic compounds.
