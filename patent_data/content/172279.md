# Human ligament replacement.

## Abstract
A ligament replacement 14 is obtained by taking a tendon 21 from an animal of appropriate size to function as the substitute for the particular human ligament to be replaced. This tendon is cut to an appropriate length and immersed in a fixing solution such as glutaraldehyde for a sufficient length of time to bind the tissue. The tendon is wrapped in a protective covering 22 and absorbable sutures 23 are passed through the tendon to provide openings. After the tendon is grafted to the human portions formerly connected to the ligament to be replaced and healing has begun, scar tissue can then migrate into the openings left by the absorbable sutures to increase the strength and the securing of the tendon to the bone portions.
