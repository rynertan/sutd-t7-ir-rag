# Method for the transport by sea of constructions to their foundations ashore.

## Abstract
The invention refers to a procedure for laying the foundation of prefabricated plants 7 comprising such types as processing plants, industrial buildings, hospitals, hotels, etc., and for their removal, assembly and foundation building at the place of destination 10 ashore. Foundations 4 are made ashore or in a dry dock or on a barge, after which the processing plant is assembled. If the foundation is manufactured outside the barge 1 , the plant 7 and or foundation 4 can be moved to transport barges 1 . Transport to the place of destination is carried out by means of sea going transport barges 1 . At the place of destination 9 the transport barges 1 are lowered onto an erection bed 2 , and the plant 7 is launched over prefabricated sliding supports 5 from transport barge to the definitive erection site 10 , which can advantageously be situated above the water level in the vicinity of the beach 9 or ashore.
