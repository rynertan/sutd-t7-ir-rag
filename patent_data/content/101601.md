# Sampling apparatus.

## Abstract
A fluid sampling apparatus includes a rotor rotatable in a body, with the body and all parts of the apparatus continuously external of a fluid source to be sampled, such as a radioactive waste circulation pipe. An aspirating plunger may be retracted to suck a measured quantity of fluid through an inlet port into a sampling chamber in the rotor. The rotor is then turned to di rect the sampling chamber downwardly and the fluid sample is ejected from an outlet port. The rotor continuously isolates the inlet and outlet ports regardless of rotary position. After one or several cycles of operation, the sample chamber may be flushed with seal water, which is under higher pressure than that of the fluid source. The foregoing abstract is merely a re sume of one general application, is not a complete discussion of all principles of operation or applications, and is not to be construed as a limitation on the scope of the claimed subject matter.
