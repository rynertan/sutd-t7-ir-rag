# Method and apparatus for applying discrete strips to a web of material.

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus in which continuous strips 16, 18 of a first material, e.g., elastic strips, are continuously supplied to flexible strip supports 32 in a supply zone S while the strip supports 32 are in a linear configuration. The strip support 32 are carried on respective transfer members 30 which are mounted on a rotatable support 34 so that individual transfer members 30 follow a closed orbital path upon rotation of the support 34 . The continuous strips 16, 18 are cut into discrete strips adhered to respective flexible strip supports 32 whose configuration, and that of the discrete strips 16, 18 adhered thereto, is then changed to a desired curvilinear configuration. The transfer members 30 are then brought into transfer contact in a transfer zone T with a moving web 24a of second material, which may comprise the backing sheet of a disposable diaper construc tion, and the curvilinear strips 16, 18 are transferred to the web 24a . Alternatively, or in addition, the individual transfer members 30 are supported on radially translatable supports 48 so that during rotation the orbital radius and thereby the linear velocity of individual transfer members 30 may be selectively varied between a first radius and consequent linear velocity in the supply zone S and a second radius and consequent linear velocity in the transfer zone T . The individual transfer members 30 may also be pivoted to selectively orient the strips 16, 18 relative to the moving web 24a in the transfer zone T .
