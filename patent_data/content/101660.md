# Method of making a pneumatic tire and pneumatic tires made in carrying out such method.

## Abstract
A method of making a pneumatic tire including a rubber tread and a casing of polyurethane elastomer is characterized by the steps of a forming an endless loop having an outer face 2 of a rubber tread and an inner face 6 of a compound con taining rubber, resorcinol, a formaldehyde donor, and an activated silica filter b vulcanizing the rubber tread endless loop by heating same to a first predetermined temperature c placing the vulcanized rubber tread endless loop into a tire mold d heating the tire mold to a second predetermined tem perature and e casting the polyurethane elastomer casing to the vulcanized rubber tread while the mold and tread are at the second predetermined temperature, which second predeter mined temperature is sufficiently high to cure the polyurethane elastomer but is below the first pretermined temperature.
