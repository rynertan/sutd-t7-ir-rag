# An electro hydrostatic device to measure the specific gravity of liquids.

## Abstract
A float constituted by a hollow body of a dielectric material 5 having on the top a metallic conducting disk 16 made from non ferromagnetic material and on the bottom a permanent magnet 6 , is immerged in the liquid 2 in a chalix shaped container 7 where on the exterior of the hollow stem there is a winding 8 constituting an electromagnet driven by the current supplied by the differential amplifier 12 . The float 5, 6, 16 assumes in the liquid a fixed position in virtue of feed back effect produced by eddy currents position voltage transducer 18, 15, 17 . The current flowing in the electromagnet is proportional, at less than a constant due to the weight of the float 5, 6, 16 to the hydrostatic buoyancy that is to say. to the specific gravity of the liquid. The fixed position of the float 5, 6, 16 makes the measure independent by the spatial non linearities of the magnetic field and, by non linearity of the positionvoltage transducer 18, 15, 17 . The centering action of electromagnet 8 on the magnet 6 avoids the friction with the walls around the float 5, 6, 16 , that remain suspended in the liquid.

## Description
kn electro hydrostatic device to measure the specific gravity of liquidsThe invention relates to a device including electronic, electrical and mechanical parts, capable of measuring the specific gravity of liquids. This device can be employed with all viscous liquids not viscoelastic and gives the output a current linearly linked to the specific gravity. The evaluation of the specific gravity is usually effected by the direct method, that is to say through the determination of the weight of a known volume of liquid or with indirect methods which avail themselves of the measure of density obtained by other means.Therefore in examining the technical solutions so far employed we must refer also to the devices employed in the determination of the density.The measurement with the direct method, even if precise, is laborious, lengthy and hardly autoDatizawble. The traditional indirect method uses the so called hydrometer consistent of the glass float with a graduate emerging portion. The measurement is not precise because it is affected by the problem of the meniscus not exactly definable and variable according to the characteristics of the liquid in addition to the mechanical tolerances of the float. moreover, because often the holder of the liquid is small the float tends to adhere to the wails. In that case the friction introduces another source of error.decently there have been attempts to automatize the measurement of density with different methods.The most siniiicant ones are based on the measure of optical refraction index of liquids or on the resonance frequency variation of cicumferential vibration modes of metallic cylinder submerged in the liquid.The first method, besides the problems of constructive precision typical of optical systems lacks the capability of application with opaque liquids. The second method is influenced by the pressure of the liquid, its viscosity and by the variations of the acoustical characteristics of the liquid with the temperature.Besides the output signal, generally, is not a linear function of density and there are necessaries proper linearization networks. The device here described offers the following advantages. Beraxts the measurement of any type of liquid providing they have viscous characteristics not viscoelastic independently of the transparency of the same.It does not manifest the meniscus problem.It is not effected bg errors due to friction. The measurement is not affected by the pressure.The measurement is not influenced by viscosity.Eventual temperature variations do not influence its precision. The output signal is linearly related to the specific gravity of liquids. The output signal is a current which permits long distance transmission. The measurement can be effected on small quantities of liquid.To illustrate the operation principle we will refer to the drawings. Let us assume that we have the solid 1 Cfig 1 that hereinafter we will refer to it as float endowed with a consistent buoyancy that tends to bring it to the surface of the liquids of which we want to measure the specific gravity. The float is completely submerged in the liquid 2 and connected by means of a wire 4 to the bottom of the holder 3, subject the wire to a traction force strictly proportional, at less than a constant equal to the non negligible weight of the float, to the specific gravity.The value of the traction force is not affected by the meniscus like in the case of the hydromemter in immersion and therefore constitutes, having a method to measure it correctly, a valid quantity to measure the specific gravity. In this, paper is used for convenience, but inexactly the term float . Really, in the device here illustrated, it works always immersed in the liquid.On the fig 2 is represented a section of a particular float. The top part 5, hollow inside, is manufactured of dielectric material glass, plastic etc while the bottom cylinder 6 is a permanent magnet. The whole solid has a cylindrical symmetry around the vertical axis aa .Let us attempt to imagine now to carry out the experiment illustrated on the fig 3, whose practical limits will be discussed later.The float 5 and 6 above described is immersed on the chalyx shaped holder 7 containing the liquid 2 to be measured.The magnet, if the float is pushed down in whatever manner, can position itself inside the bottom and thin part of the holder stem of chalyx to whose exterior is present a winding of conducting wire 8, iNhen in this winding there is not a flow of current, the float is carried to the surface by the hydrostatic buoyanoy. If instead, by means of current generator 9, we allow the flow in the correct direction a suitable current, the float positions itself in an internediate position between the liquid top surface and bottom of the holder.The current flowing in the winding b in this situation, measurable by means of amperometer 10, is proportional, at less than a constant, to the specific gravity of the lir Luih, In the event this would substitute with one wit different density and, varying current, the float is brought again in the same position of the previous case one would measure a new value tied to the new specific gravity through the same coefficient of proportionality.In this way one obtains a specific gravity current transducer that shows the following advantages The float is completely immersed in t liquid and therefore all problems connected with the meniscus are absent a centering action on the float is obtained by the couple magnet electromagnet thus avoiding friction on the walls of the external container The above mentioned centering action allows the reduction of interspace dimension betweeen the float and the chalyx and consequently permits a precise measurement even in small quantities of liquid. The interaction force between magnet and electromagnet is not affected by non linear spatial distribution of magnetic field because, independently of the specific gravity of liquid, it is possible to bring the float in the same position varying current, in virtue of this the magnetic force is strictly proportional to the current that flows in the electromagnet winding.The transm,ission of tS information at a big distance is not affected by the wire resistance because the measurement is tied to a current for the sane reason the resistance variation with the temperature appreciable if one takes into account that the resistance of copper varies almost 4 per thousand per degree centigrade do not affect the measurements.The above described outline is really difficult to carry out because tne balance position reac.M ed by the float is unstable. Unavoidably in short time it is pushea on the surface or towards the bottom and that is to say towards the electromagnet0 It is necessary to introduce a feed back device that renders the float position stable. That can be carried out with the fig 4 configuration. The element 11 is a position vol tage. transducer that gives a d. c. voltage directly proportional to its own distance from the float 5.The differential amplifier 12 connected to the transducer and to a variable reference I3 with corrected inputs polarity drives the electromagnet with a voltage that increases in proportion with the loat nearing the surface.It is possible to select the float position more or less near to the transducer, by means of the potentiometer I3, that supplies a variable voltage to non inverting input of differential amplifier. At this stanza position of stable equilibrium will take place because, at a certain point, providing that the amplifier I2 gain is sufficiently high, any aa ditlonal rise of the float 5 will bring about an increase of the output voltage V of the amplifier and therefore of tne field generated by the electromagnet 8 such to oppose the push of the hydrostatic buoyancy.When the liquid density changes, in spite of buoyancy variations, by virtue of the high gain of the amplifier the float position within the Liquid remains more or less the same.in addition to the motives above mentioned, this results in certain advantages because a small working distance range or position voltage transducer is involved. Thus its eventual non linearity has insignificant influence on the measure ment.The electromagnet 8 current feeding principle is safeguarded also if the amplifier 12 has a conventional low impedance output stage and thusly behaves approximately, as an ideal voltage generator. In fact, by virtue of feed back effect due to the transducerII voltage V automatically assumes such a value that the current flowing in the circuit is proportional to the specific gravity of liquid independently of the winding or the line 14 resistance variations.If because of temperature, for example, the winding resistance doubles, assu ning zero the line It, resist angS the voltages V doubles keeling the current constant, For the best operation of ire system, the position voltage transducer 11 must have thefollowing characteristics a Great sensitivity, that is to say strong variation of the output voltage to the varying positions of the float b insensitivity to the liquid characteristics c reduced dimension3 d simplicity of the circuitry and consequently low cost e no contact operation. The position voltage transducer applicable, on principle, in this case are th following optical transducera capacity transaucers ultrasound transducers magnetic transducers eddy probes .The first are employable only with transparent liquidsThe capacity transducers are affected by the dielectric characteristics of the liquid and show moreover a notable circuital complexity. The ultrasound transducers are expensive and lack precision and are strongly influenced by the acoustical propagation constants of the liquid that are in turn sensitive to temperature. The eddy current magnetic transducers eddy probes on the contrary show the required characteristics.The possible configuration of this type of transducers are numerous. We will remember the principle referring to the model described on the fig 5.A sinusoidal oscillator I8 feeds the primary winding P of a transformer 15 wound on a core with open magnetic circuit that is with a big air gap. On the same core there is a secondary winding S , where at the terminals can be observed a sinusoidal voltage.If on the space zone in front of the magnetic poles is placed a conducting disk made of non ferromagnetic metal copper, aluminium, etc there arises in that dl.s eddy inducted currents which subtract energy from the field and reduces the value of the secondary voltage.On removing and anproaching the metal disk from the magnetic poles, the secondary voltage, that can be made direct b means of a suitable detector, increases ana decreases. In this manner we obtain a positiond.c. voltage transducer.By opportunely shaping the core a good linearity for little displacement and a high sensitivity can be obtained.bet us consider now the final coniiguration assumed by the system with this type of transducer examining fig 6. The float 6 is provided on the uper surface of an aluminium diskJ6 that is in front of the transducer 15. rihe oscillator 8 fournishes the sinusoidal voltage to the primary winding of transducer 15 whose secondary is connected to a rectitier circuit T j. The a.c. voltage appearing to his terminals, directly proportional to the float distance, feeds the inverting input of dirferential amplifier 12 that drives the electromagnet 8 and fixes the position of the float 5,o,i6 na cnalix container 7 can be fille.l with the liquid under measure by different methods according to his characteristics and the particular type of application. In the practical raalisation of device an appropriate circuitry must be provided to remove from the output data the constant value of the current due to the weight of the float.
