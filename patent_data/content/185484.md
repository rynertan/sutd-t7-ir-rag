# Self containing package system for storage and transportation of prefabricated portions of a building structure and the assembly thereof.

## Abstract
A floor or ceiling unit 10 is prefabricated in two halves 10A, 10B which can be assembled together to form the unit or one of the halves can be turned upsidedown and nested underneath the other half thus forming a package with upper and lower panels 12 . These panels 12 can be secured together and reduce the overall width of the package to a dimension which is smaller than the maximum allowable width for transportation on world roads. Also included are vertical support members 16 and a pair of perimetrical beams 21 which extend between the vertical support members and means on the beams and support members to receive and support the assembled floor or ceiling unit. The vertical support members 16 and the perimetrical beams 21 can be stored between the joists of the two halves 10A, 10B when they are packaged for transportation and a plurality of such packages can be stacked one upon the other upon a truck or the like thus enabling an entire building to be transported readily and easily within allowable size limits and which can be readily erected on site with the minimum of effort.
