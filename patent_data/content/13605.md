# Stylet insertion assembly for body implantable lead.

## Abstract
A body implantable lead comprises a lead portion 10 having a distal electrode end portion 12 and a proximal terminal end protion 13 . End portion 12 comprises a helical tissue securing member 42 adapted to be screwed into ani mal tissue by the rotation of stylet 20 via slotted screwdriver end 62 and slot 64 . The stylet 20 is rotated by a knob 74 secured to the proximal end of the stylet and in order for the operator to sense the depth of insertion of the tissue securing member 42 the knob 74 is formed with at least one lon gitudinal slot detentingly engaged by a pawl formed in the guide 76 to give a sensible indication each time a predeter mined rotational increment has been traversed.
