# Method of controlling operation of an electrostatic precipitator.

## Abstract
The invention relates to the method of controlling the operating parameters of an electrostatic precipitator which is energised by voltage pulses superimposed on a DC voltage. The pulse height is continuously increased linearly with time and spark overs are detected as reductions in the precipitator voltage below a selectable set value and are sorted into different types according to the time of their occurrence and their duration. According to the type of spark over detected so the operating parameters of the filter are modified accordingly.
