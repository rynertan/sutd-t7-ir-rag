## Description
The invention relates to a milking implement provided with at least one teat cup, which can be attached to the udder of an animal, said teat cup comprising a space to accommodate the teat. In a milking implement of this kind the milk is sucked from the teat, a massaging action being exerted on the teat through the supply of a varying under pressure. Said varying under pressure is brought about, according to a further aspect of the invention, in a space between the exterior wall of the teat cup and the flexible teat holder constituting the interior lining of the teat cup. The invention envisages a milking implement which makes it possible to perform the milking in a reliable and efficient manner. For this purpose means are provided, according to the invention, for bringing about a varying sequence of an under pressure and an exceed pressure within the space to accommodate the teat. Consequently there is no need to install separate pulsation conduits, while a massaging action is exerted on the teats of the udder all the same. The space between the exterior wall of the teat cup and the flexible teat holder may comprise an outward air passage, although it is also possible to have this space function as a resilient air cushion. According to a further aspect of the invention, the teat holder, contained within the teat cup and con stituting the space to accommodate the teat, may be provided on its interior side with one or more upwardly merging lamellae. Because of this arrangement a proper contact between the teat holder and the teat is obtained, eliminating the risk of air being sucked on along the teat during sucking. However, provided a sufficient exceed pressure prevails in the milk conduit, air may escape in an upward direction between the teat and the lamellae. According to another aspect of the invention, a carrying member may be provided, e.g. a carrying strap, which can be attached around the animal and press the teat cups against the udder. Furthermore, several teat cups may be fixed to a central portion, said portion being stayed by the carrying member. According to a further aspect of the invention, means may be provided for keeping the teat cup permanently attached to the teat of the animal s udder, while further means may be available for carrying out an upward and downward movement of the teat cup in respect of the teat. Said upward and downward movement may be conducive to the massaging effect on the teat, it being possible to bring about such a movement by supplying, in a varying sequence, an exceed pressure and an under pressure towards the teat cup. According to a further aspect of the invention, the teat cups may be provided with a laterally directed connection, making it possible to obtain a compactly con structed teat cup, said teat cup being possibly provided, according to a further aspect of the invention, with a bottom arranged in such a place that the teat of the udder may get in contact with said bottom. According to a further aspect of the invention, said bottom is so compliant near its centre that it cannot shut off the locking hole of the teat. To that effect the exterior wall of the teat cup is preferably provided with a local embossment device, so that the pressurized teat holder may be moved in said embossment device. The milking implement comprising four teat cups may be designed, according to a further aspect of the inven tion, in such a manner that the teat cups are aligned and that diagonally arranged teat cups are subjected simultaneously to an under pressure, respectively to an exceed pressure. Thus, a favourable distribution of force among the associated teat cups and the udder is obtained. According to a further aspect of the invention, the aligned arrangement of the teat cups may be adjustable, the teat cups being connected to a central portion which can be attached to the animal by means of a carrying member, such as a carrying strap. According to an aspect of the invention, the carrying member may stay the teat cup against the downwardly exerted force, resulting from the introduc tion of an exceed pressure into the teat cup. According to another aspect of the invention, the carrying member may project between the milk cups at a height, farther elevated than the lowermost end of the teat cup, as a consequence of which the vertical size of the part of the milking implement which is attached to the udder of the animal can remain restricted to a minimum. The animals should preferably occupy a site in the parlour throughout the year with the udders of the animals remaining uninterruptedly attached to the milking implement. In this way a milking implement may operate continuously, the frequency of milking the animal in a 24 hours period depending on the number of milking implements and on the number of animals. Thus, the economical output of the milking implement is increased. Furthermore, the production of milk is stepped up by the high frequency of milking the animals may be milked six to twelve times per 24 hours period. It is preferable that during the intervals between milking the part of the milking implement that is not used for milking should be utilized for supplying a liquid to the teats of the udder. This liquid may contain a cleaning agent. Further, the part of the milking implement that is not used for milking may also be utilized for supplying air to the teats of the animal. The liquid may be circulated and the air may escape near the teats. The supply of liquid and air may also exert a massaging effect, stimulating the blood circulation in the teats. In order to further hygiene and for the sake of the animal s health, the floor of the place of residence of an animal may be of an at least partially movable construc tion. The animal is allowed in such an arrangement to per form movements, while remaining connected to the milking implement. If the floor comprises a chain conveyor which can be driven by a motor in a rearward direction, the animal is obliged to move forwardly at a certain speed with regard to the floor. Dust and contaminating substances are then transported by the conveyor at the same time, so that a fresh and clean place of residence is created for the animal. It is preferable that the installation should comprise control members which are controlled by a computer, so that there is an automatic sequence in the milking of the animals, the movements of the animals, the cleaning of the places of residence and the feeding of the animals. For a better understanding of the invention, some embodiments of an installation for milking animals will be given, reference being made to the accompanying drawings, in which In the various figures, which are only schematic renderings, corresponding components carry similar reference numerals. Figure 1 shows a plan view of a parlour which comprises two rows of milking sites 1. The milking sites are provided with a feeding gutter 2 at the front and with a conveyor 3 for discharging manure at the back. In the longi tudinal direction of each row of milking sites 1, a set of conduits 4 is arranged underneath the above mentioned milking sites, said conduits being designed in such a way that an attachment to conduits 4 can be brought about in each milking site. The conduits 4 comprise one or more liquid and or air pipes. Furthermore, a schematic rendering of a milk tank 5 is given, which also goes for a tank 6 for water, rinsing liquid or cleansing liquid. A tank 7 for compressed air is also rendered. A pump, if at all provided, for bringing about a vacuum or under pressure, is not further detailed. The installation may further comprise a computer 8 and control means 9 for an automatic control, check and or protection of the installation. Figure 2 shows a cow 10, occupying a milking site. Said cow 10 is provided with a milking cluster 11, which may be permanently connected to the udder of the cow. The milking cluster 11 comprises an envelope 12, made of a transparent synthetic material and attached to the cow by means of straps 13. Contained within the envelope 12 are the teat cups 14, which will be further explained. The floor of the milking parlour consists of a conveyor with mutually coupled, movable elements 15, linked to one another in the shape of an endless conveyor. The conveyor is provided with two final guiding members 16, about which the elements 15 can move, and with a support 17 to stay the elements 15, constituting the floor of the milking site 1. The conveyor as described before having been actuated, the elements 15 which constitute the floor of the milking site can move in a rearward direction with regard to the cow, so that the cow is compelled to start walking and defilements, possibly present on the floor, can be dis charged in a rearward direction. Near the floor of the milking site connections 18 are provided, through which connections an under pressure, cleansing or rinsing liquid and or pre heated air can be supplied and milk, and possibly other liquids, discharged. The term under pression or vacuum means an air pressure lower than the atmospheric pressure the term over pressure or exceed pressure is used for a pressure higher than the atmospheric pressure . For that purpose the necessary conduits 19 are led from the milking cluster 11 to the connections 18. Behind the milking site 1 a grating 20 is rendered, allowing the manure and other defilements, if any, to fall through, then to be transported by discharge means, which are not rendered in Figure 2. Figure 3 shows a cross section of the transparent envelope 12, containing four teat cups 14, of which two are visible. The teat cups are provided with a connection, directed forwardly, in view of the necessary conduits. The upper rim 22 of the teat cup is adapted to the shape of the udder, so that a proper attachment to the udder can be obtained. The upper rim 22 is set in the flexible upper part 23 of the teat cup. The straps 13, ensuring the attachment of the milking cluster to the cow, carry both the envelope 12 and a central portion 24, to which the teat cups 14 are connected. Through a flexible conduit 19, containing various pipes, the teat cups are linked with the connections 18 near the floor of the milking site. The floor of the milking site consists of elements 15, mutually connected and guided around the chain wheels 25, as an endless conveyor. One or more of the chain wheels 25 may be driven by means which are not further defined, such as an electric motor. Figure 4 shows, in a way similar to that of Figure 3, the milking cluster in a lateral view. The envelope 12 is provided with a flexible upper rim 26, making it possible to obtain a proper attachment to the udder of the cow. A cross section is given of the elements 15, constituting the floor, said elements consisting of e.g. steel beams with a closed profile and being mutually linked up by means of shackles 28, constituting a chain which engages with the chain wheels 25. Figure 5 shows in more detail the embodiment of the milking cluster. It comprises a schematic rendering of the udder 30 with the teats 31 of the cow. The udder 30 is encompassed by the transparent envelope 12 which is attached to the cow by means of a strap 13. Contained within the envelope 12 is a central portion 24, which is also connected to strap 13 by means of a bolt 32. Attached to the central portion 24 are the four teat cups 14, a cross section of two such cups being provided in Figure 5. The teat cups 14 are provided on the upper side with a flexible top part 23, which may have such a shape that the required attachment to the udder can be obtained. Although the upper part 23 may, because of its flexibility, adapt itself to the shape of the udder, it may be desirable to pre shape said upper part in such a manner, that a shape is obtained which matches the average size of an udder. In that case the upper part 23 will not have a symmetric shape. The teat cups 14, rendered in Figure 5, are relatively short, i.e. they have a comparatively small size in height and, accordingly, the teat 31 will extend to the vicinity of the teat cup s lowermost side. Within the teat cup, the teat holder 33 is provided, said holder being integrally connected with the flexible upper part 23 and encompassing the teat when the latter is present in the teat cup. Around the teat holder 33 a chamber 34 is provided, which may function as a resilient air cushion or be provided with a breather opening so that an atmospheric air pressure is maintained in the chamber 34. Through the milk hose 29 an under pressure and an exceed pressure are supplied in a varying sequence. When an under pressure prevails, milk is being sucked from the teat, while there is a massage of the teat when an exceed pressure prevails, in which process air may escape along the teat. Provided in the teat holder 33 are sensors 37, which can detect if the teats occupy a correct position in the teat cup. The sensors 37 are con nected by means of electrical conduits 38 to a control unit which is not shown in Figure 5. In order to avoid that, at times when an under pressure prevails, the locking hole of the teat is shut off because it settles against the lowermost side of the teat holder, the teat cup 14 is pro vided with an embossment device 41, keeping the teat cup from shutting off the locking hole. The milk hoses 39, shown in Figure 5, ensure the discharge of milk and are mounted in a lateral position with regard to the teat cups 14 in such a manner that the total height of the teat cup scarcely exceeds the length of the teat 31. Thus, a compact teat cup can be obtained, its height being less than twice the diameter. Generally speaking, an advantage of such a teat cup is that the parts of the milking cluster do not project downwardly farther than necessary, which reduces the risk of the animal kicking the milking cluster down. As is evident from Figure 7, the strap 13, to which the central portion 24 is connected by means of bolt 32 through a slotted hole 42, traverses the transparent envelope 12, so that both said envelope 12 and the milking cluster are supported. Figure 6 is a schematic bottom view of the milking cluster, shown in Figure 5. Figure 6 renders four milk hoses 39, each of which leads to a teat cup 14. The teat cups 14 are connected, by means of mutually pivotable arms 40, to the central portion that is attached to the strap 13. Accordingly, the teat cups are allowed to move in respect of one another in a substantially level plane, enabled to do so also because the hoses 39 are sufficiently flexible for that purpose. Therefore, the milking cluster can adapt itself to the position of the teats, which position may vary according to the state or condition of the udder. From Figure 6 it is clear that the embossment devices 41 at the lowermost sides of the teat cups 14 have a slightly protracted shape. It is preferable that the low and high pressure in the various teat cups should be brought about in such a way, that two teat cups, situated diagonally in respect of one another, are subjected simultaneously to a low, respectively to a high pressure, as indicated by the arrows 44. A certain upward movement of the milking cluster may result from the varied suction, which may have a positive influence on the milking process. Figure 7 shows a teat cup which is provided with a teat holder 33 with substantially annular, upwardly directed lamellae 43. These lamellae may lean against the teat and prevent air from being sucked on along the teat in those periods when an under pressure prevails in the milk hose. Air or liquid is allowed to escape along the teat, however, if a sufficient exceed pressure is brought about in the milk hose, e.g. during cleansing or drying of the teat. Although certain features of the implement that have been described and or that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings will be set forth in the following claims as inventive features, it is emphasized that the invention is not necessarily limited to those features and that it includes within its scope each of the parts of the implement that has been described, and or that is illustrated in the accompanying drawings, both individually and in various combinations.
