# Liquid scintillation composition for low volume biological specimens.

## Abstract
A liquid scintillation cocktail especially suitable for low volume biological specimens comprising an aromatic liquid, preferably pseudocumene, for capturing energy from radia tion, at least one fluor, preferably PPO and Bis MSB, and a mixture of anionic and nonionic surfactants. The cocktails are prepared by treating with a cation exchange resin to clarify and with a solid buffer to raise the temperature at which cloudiness develops upon heating.
