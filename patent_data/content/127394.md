## Description
MUTANT HUMAN T CELL LINES PRODUCING IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVEFACTOR AND METHOD FOR OBTAINING SUCH MUTANTSFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates generally to new mutant cell lines and methods for producing them, and more specifically to a mutant human T cell line and its subclones which secrete high titer suppressive factor.BACKGROUNDIt is well established that activated lymphoid cells elaborate a variety of soluble factors called lymphokines participating in the regulation of the immune response reviewed by Altman et al. 1 3. The profile of factors reported include migration inhibitory factor 2,3 , lymphotoxin 4,5 , transfer factor 6,7 , lymphocyte proliferation inhibitory factor 8,9 and interferon 10,11 . Despite the overwhelming nunber of published studies on lymphokines with immunoregulating activities, the function structural relationship of these molecules is still poorly understood.Progress in the study of lymphokines has been strongly impeded by two major limitations. Firstly, due to the heterogen of the cell populations used to prepare conventional lymphokines, it is extremely difficult to assign a given biological activity to a distinct molecule.Secondly, the amounts of a given lymphokine in conventional preparations are usually too small to allow a precise biochemical analysis of the biologically active molecules. Moreover, since lymphocytes have a finite and usually short lifetime in culture, it is impossible to obtain repeatedly homogenous lymphokine preparations for characterization studies. These difficulties with regard to the study of lymphokines have caused workers in the field to experiment with cell lines and hybridomas.The establishment of stable T cell lines secreting homogenous and distinct lymphokines has generated a large amount of information on the functions of soluble mediators preview by Moller 12 3. The continuous requirement for T cell growth factor TCGF for maintaining these clones has however hampered large scale production of specific lyqphokines. Recently, T T hybridomas have been constructed 13 17 to immortalize lymphokine secreting T cells. Since hybridomas are TCGF independent, some investigators in the field have thought they would serve as better sources than cloned T cell lines for preparing larger quantities of lymphokines for biochexaical characterization. Human lymphoid cell lines also produce a number of factors similar to mediators of cellular immunity releasaff by lymphocytes. Gillis, et al., 18 showed that the hunan T cell line Jurkat produces large quantities of human interleukin 2 IL2 upon stimulation with mitogen. Farrar, et al., 19 showed that the mouse thymoma EL4 secretes high concentrations of mouse IL2 upon stimulation by the mutagen phorbol myristate acetate. These two cell lines produce such abundant quantities of the respective factors that detailed biochemical analysis of their functionstructural relationships are underway.Vesole, et al., 20 have described previous reports of lymphoid lines which secrete low levels of uncharacterized suppressor factors that inhibit DEA synthesis of mitogen stimulated lymphocytes, while noting that stimulation of lymphocyte growth and thus of DEk synthesis may also be caused by supernatants of lymphoid cell lines. In theVesole reference itself, the authors indicate that the human lymphoid cell line CCRF CEM CEM secretes a substance which by itself increases DNA synthesis in lymphocytes. These authors also disclose that CEM secretes an uncharacterized substance which weakly inhibits mitogenic response in mononuclear cells stimulated with a mitogen such as PHA.From Figure 1 in this reference, it can be seen that 50 inhibition of the mitogenic response is achieved at a dilution of about six fold i.e., about lO O.8 . This inhibiting substance is stated to elute on a Sephadex G 100 column with the albumin peak and thus has a molecular weight of about 70,000 dalton.One of the references cited in Vesole Yoshida, et al., J.Immunol., 117, 518 1976 also discloses work with CEM among other cell lines to examine its ability to release lymphokines into its culture medium, but there is no disclosure of any T cell suppressor factor being looked for or.found.Although various other mutants of various cell lines including CEM have been produced by other investigators, none of them even suggested that one could obtain a cell line secreting high titer suppressor factor.Reference is made in this regard to Foung, et al., PNAS U.S.A. , 79 7484 7488 December 1982 , Lakow, et al.,J.Immunol., 130, 169 172 January 1983 , and DeFreitas, et al. 16 , who reported work with the human T cell lineJurkat.Additionally, several authors have reported work with mutants of the T cell line CEM. Okada, et al,, PNAS U.S.A. 78 7717 7721 December 1981 , reported work with an 8 azaguanine resistant mutant of CEM, while Irigoyen, et al., 17 reported establishment of a 6 thioguanineresistant mutant from the cell line CEM. Irigoyen, et al., describe the preparation of a 6thioguanine 6T resistant mutant of the CEM cell line and the subsequent fusing of this mutant with lectinstimulated human T cells to produce human hunan T cell hybridomas. No mention is made of the source of the parent CEM cell line. The method used for production of the mutant involved an initial mutation by ethyl methanesulfonate followed by exposure to increasing concentrations of 6T 1.25 g 5 pg ml , after which the mutant cells were maintained in 16.7 pg ml of 6 thioguanine.Irigoyen, et al., is the only group known to Applicant which has reported on the characteristics of a 6Tresistant mutant CSt line. Their mutant line CEM T15 the only one discussed in the reference was described as lacking the OKT3 antigen and having a chromosome number karotype of 35 47, the sane as the parent CEM line used in its production.Additionally, Irigoyen s parent CEM line and the mutant line CEM T15 both grew normally in the presence of 10 8M aminopterin 0.004 iig ml , both died in the presence of 10 7M aminopterin 0.04 ig ml , and there was differential growth CEM grew, while CEM T15 died at 3.3x1O8M and 6.6x10 8M aminopterin 0.013 and 0.026 vg ml, respectively . The reference also indicates that CEM T15... inhibits the background level of PFC plaque forming cells generated in cultures containing B cells and PWM pokeweed mitogen .1 This result indicates that CEM T15 inhibits B cell differentiation. No information is given regarding any action on T cell differentiation.These reports provided no suggestion that one could produce a stable mutant cell line which would have excellent growth characteristics and would secrete high titer suppressor factor. In fact, the present inventor observed in the course of the work leading to this invention tha azaguanine resistant mutant CEM line was produced which showed deficiency in the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine ribotransferase like the 6T resistant mutant but did not exhibit the beneficial characteristics found in the cell line of the present invention.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONAccording to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method producing a stable 6 thioguanine resistant mutant of a lymphoblastoid cell line secreting an enhanced level of lymphokine which comprises treating said lymphoblastoid cell line with from 20 to 30 g ml of 6 thioguanine for a period of time sufficient to kill at least 90 of the cells and isolating the viable cells.This method is applicable to lymphoblastoid cell lines of human or animal origin, as well as to lymphoblastoid cell lines of T cell or B cell origin. According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a stable 6 thioguanine resistant mutant of the lymphoblastoid cell line CEM which secretes constitutively a high titer of a non mitogenic, non cytotoxic T cell suppressor inducer factor.According to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided a suppressor inducer factor which a at a dilution of up to 10 6 suppresses at least 90 of mitogen induced T etlproliferation b is contained in a high molecular weight protein of about 110,000 daltons M.W. c exhibits maximum suppressor activity at physiological pH d is inactivated at 560 C e is non mitogenic and non cytotoxic and suppresses mouse spleen cellproliferation to mitogenic stimulation with the same potency as it suppresses.human peripheral blood lymphocyte prQliferation to mitogenic stimulation,Qn A non mitogenic, non cytotoxic T cell suppressor factor which suppresses at least 90 of T cell proliferation to nitogenic, stimulation at dilution of up to x io and whose suppressive activity is blocked by the monosaccharide rhamnose. In a more particular aspect of the present invention, there is prided a novel stable 6 thioguanine resistant mutant of the lymphoblastoid cell line C RF CEM designated 6T CEM which secretes constitutively into the grroin medium a high titer of a non mitogenic, non ctyotoxic T cell suppressor inducer factor SIF which induces production of a T cell suppressor factor TSF . These factors were unknown prior to the present invention. This discovery is most surprising in view of the results reported by Vesole, et al., and Irigoyen, et al. The cell free supernatant of the particular novel mutant containingSIF suppresses at least 908 of mitogen induced T cell proliferation at dilutions as high as 10 6, while the cell free supernatant of its most productive subclone exhibits such suppression at a dilution up to 10 9. The supernatants do not suppress mitogen induced B cell proliferation at these dilutions. This titer has remained constant for over 8 months. The mechanism of action, the cellular target, and the biochemical characterization of the factors responsible for the observed suppression have been determined. The factor SIF also exhibits T cell proliferation suppression in vivo.The term stable as used herein in reference to the subject mutant and its subclones means that the mutant and its subclones continue to secrete high titer SIF for at least six months. Additionally, the stable mutant and subclones do not suffer any appreciable change in their karotype over this same period. It should be understood in general that mutants or subclones of mutants which are not stable are not practically useful, since they will not serve as reliable sources of lymphokines in general or SIF in particular.The tern. non mitogenic as used herein means that the SIF secreted by the subject mutant and its subclones has no observed mitogenic effect on human T cells. The term non cytotoxic as used herein means that the SIF secreted by the subject mutant and its subclones has no observed cytotoxic effect on human T cells. The term suppression and its variants as used herein mean a dininution in the activity which is suppressed , which diminution may be partial or complete.Mutant cell lines according to the invention are useful not only for secretion of syppressorinducer factor, but also as potential partners in hybridoma formation. With regard to this second utility, aminopterin sensitivity is extremely important, because human lymphocytes and thus human hybridomas produced from human lymphocytes are much more sensitive to aminopterin than corresponding mouse lymphocytes or hybridomas. Accordingly, in order to differentially select human hybridomas using HAT medium, smaller amounts of aminopterin must be used in the medium to ensure survival of the desired hybridomas and hence the unfused cell line must be very sensitive to the material.The SIF and TSF produced as part of the subject invention are useful for suppressing T cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo.Included within the present invention are the mutant cell line 6T CEM, subclones of this mutant cell line including that designated 6T CEM 20 , method for preparing the cell lines and the subclones, the suppressor inducer factor produced by the mutant cell lines and subclones, the T cell suppressor factor induced thereby, and methods for suppressing T cell proliferation using said factors in vitro. These methods comprise treating said T cells in vitro with an effective T cell proliferation suppressing amount of either the suppressor inducer factor or the T cell suppressor factor. The invention also includes the suppressor inducer factor or T cell suppressor factor, or pharmaceutical compositions containing them, for use in vivo in suppressing T cell proliferation.The particular mutant cell line 6T CEM was produced by treating the parent line CEM obtained from the American TypeCulture Collection with an initial high concentration of 6T about 20 30 pg ml of 6T for a period of time sufficient to kill at least 90 of the cells the small percentage of surviving cells after seven days treatment with 30 pg ml of 6T constituted the mutant cell line 6TCEM. In contrast to the prior art, no additional mutagen was used and the cells were exposed to an initial high concentration of 6T rather than progressively increasing concentrations. It appears that the treatment of the parent line with a high concentration of er from the beginning was significant in yielding the subject mutant cell line. Prior art references dealing with mutating procedures have taught one to begin with low concentrations of mutating agent and progressively increase the amount. The Irigoyen, et al., reference is typical.Once the particular cell line was obtained1 it was possible by techniques known in the art to subclone the particular mutant cell line to obtain subclones having higher levels of suppressor inducer factor production. Both the particular mutant cell line and its subclones possess the OKT3 antigen and may be detected with OKT3 monoclonal antibody 31 .The discovery of this SIF secreting mutant cell line is surprising not only in view of the state of the art, but also in view of Applicant s unsuccessful attempts to produce such a mutant cell line of CEM using azaguanine.The pa nil line CEM M secretes only low levels of an uncharacterized suppressive factor, as set out in Vesole, et al. The Okada, et al., reference noted above, which discloses an azaguanine resistant mutant of CEM, indicates only that T T hybridomas prepared using this cell line secreted I62 and a helper factor. No information is presented regarding any factors which might be secreted by the azaguanine resistant mutant CEM itself Moreover,Okada et al., indicate in the right hand column on page 7720 that it may be impossible to find T leukemic cell lines that produce several other lymphokines such as killer helper factor s or T cell replacing factor. This observation teaches away froia the subject invention.Because of the difficulties in purifying factors which occur only in low concentration, the prior art low titer suppressive factors are as a practical matter impossible to purify and characterize. Typically, 50 908 of any protein is lost in the purifying steps. Hence, if one were to attempt to purify prior art factors such as that of Vesole, et al. , activity would vanish before purification was achieved.The present Applicant has also discovered that the method used above for producing the mutant cell line 6T CEM is also effective to produce stable mutants of other lymphoblastoid cell lines which have enhanced production of lymphokines over the parent cell line used for production of the mutant. For example, the lymphoblastoid cell line HSB ATCC CCL 120.1 produces an uncharacterized suppressive factor which suppresses mitogen induced T cell differentiation only at a dilution of 10 i. The stable mutant cell line 6T HSB produced by the same method as 6TCEM, by comparison. produces a factor that suppresses such proliferation at a dilution of lO . The preparation and characterization of the particular mutant cell line and the resulting suppressor inducer factor and the T cell suppressor factor induced thereby will be described by way of example only and better understood by reference to the following.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFigure 1.

Pokeweed mitogen PWM was obtained from Gibco.Aminopterin and mitomycin C mit C were obtained fromSigma. C57 B6 and DBA 2 mice were obtained from theJackson Laboratory. Growth medium for human cell lines consisted of a minimum essential medium a MEM Gibco supplemented with penicillin Gibco, 50 pg ml , streptomycin Gibco, 100 pg ml , L glutamine Gibco, 2.0 mM and 210 fetal calf serum FCS, Gibco . The medium for the T cell proliferation assay was the same except RPMI 1640 Gibco was used instead of a MEM 10 FCS was used at all times. The monosaccharides fructose, NAG, rhamnose, and a methyl mannoside, and the prostaglandin inhibitor indomethacin were obtained from Sigma. EXAMPLE IGeneration of 6 thioguanine 6T resistant mutant 6T CEM and the subclone 6T CEM 20. The 6 thioguanine 2 anino 6mercaptopurine 6T was obtained from Signa Cat. No. A4882 . 100 mg of 6T was dissolved in 100 ml of distilled water. 1 or 2 drops of 10 N NaOH were added to help the 6T to dissolve completely. The pH of the final solution is about 9.The lympboblastic leukemic line CEM M CCRF CEM, ATCC CCL 119 was obtained from the American Type CultureCollection, Rockville, MD, and was maintained in 90 MEM and 10S FCS. CEM cells at log phase 106 cells well were treated with various concentrations of 6T and viability was assayed 7 days later Table 1 . Cells treated with 30 iig ml of 6T were selected for further studies. The remaining viable cells 4 were grown in 25 mm culture flasks.until a significant number of cells was observed, after which dead cells were removed by a Ficoll Hypaque gradient. The viable cells were divided into 2 parts. One part was maintained in a MEM FCS with fresh medium added every third day and the cells were passaged every week. The other part was plated in 96 well microtiter plates for subcloning. The subclones grew up in about 2 3 weeks, after which they were transferred to 24 well Linbro trays. When the cells reached a density of 106 well, they were tested for aminopterin sensitivity and the production of the suppressor inducer factor Table 2 . 6T CEM 20, one of the subclones which showed the highest level of factor production, was selected for further studies.The growth characteristics, karotype, sensitivity to aminopterin, level of suppressor activity and effects of supernatants on other immunological as says are listed inTable 3 for CEM, 6T CEM, 6T CEM 20, and Az CEM an azaguanine resistant CEM mutant . The line 6T CEM 20 has been showing a consistent level of suppressor inducer factor secretion for greater than eight months, indicating no loss of chromosome s involved in the secretion of the factor. The stability data are shown in Table 4.EXAMPLE IIProduction of suppressive supernatants. 6T CEM cells were routinely maintained in a MEM containing 10 FCS. For production of the suppressive supernatants from 6T CST, cells were washed and suspended at 2x105 cells ml or 106 cells ml in a MEM with 28 FCS. Supernatant was harvested 48 hours later and the functional activities were assessed. The standard procedure for the production of the lymphocyte derived suppressor factor TSF involved incubation of the lymphocyte population of interest at 3x106 cels ml in the presence of 1 500 dilution 9f 6T 20SIF the suppressor inducer factor produced by the subclone 6T CEM 20 . After 24 hours, cells were washed 3 4 times and then set up at 1x106 cells ml in RPMI 1640 with 2 FCS.Supernatants were harvested 72 hours afterwards unless otherwise indicated.EXAMPLE IIIPreparation of purified populations of lymphocytes.Peripheral blood lymphocytes PBL were obtained from the blood of normal donors by using standard Ficoll Hypaque gradient techniques 21 . The T and non T cells were separated by standard sheep red blood cell SRBC rosetting technique 21 . Briefly, 5x106 ml PBL were incubated with 18 neuraminidase treated SRBC, and rosetted cells were separated from non rosetted cells on a FicollHypaque gradient. The rosetted cells were designated as T cells. Purified B lymphocytes were obtained from nonrosetted cells by removal of residual T cells using the Pan T monoclonal antibody OKTll and complement. PurifiedOKT4 and OKT8 cells were obtained by treating T lymphocytes 107 ml with 1 g of the respective monoclonal antibody, followed by complement lysing.Dead cells were removed by Ficoll Hypaque gradient and purity of the subset was assayed with the ORTHO Spectrum III cytofluorograph Ortho Diagnostic Systems using fluorescent labeled monoclonal antibodies. Adherent cells were removed by putting 10 ml of lymphocytes at 106 ml on a 100 mmm Petri dish Falcon . Cells were incubated at 370C for 2 3 hours. The nonadherent cells were recovered from the medium and the subsequent washes with gentle pipetting.Adherent cells were released from the plate by the addition of ethylenedianine tetraacetic acid EDTA, 0.2mM,Gibco . Employing these techniques, T lymphocytes were usually 95 OKTll and 1 28 OKM1 before removal of adherent cells, and 96 OKTll and OKM1 after removal of adherent cells. B cells were OKTll , 68 Ig and 20 OKM1 before removal of adherent cells, and 78 Ig and 2 OKM1 after removal of adherent cells.

AllOK monoclonal antibodies were supplied by Ortho DiagnosticSystems 31 . EXAMPLE IVLymphocyte proliferation. T cell proliferation 7x104 105 human T lymphocytes were cultured in U bottom microtiter plates Flow in the presence of 0.1 PHA P or 1 64PWM for 4 days. 3H thymidine 0.1 pCi well was added for the last 6 hours of the culture period. T cell dependentB cell proliferation 2x104 T cells and 105 B cells were cultured together in the presence of 1 64 dilution of PWM for 4 days. 3H thymidine was added for the last 6 hours of the culture period. B cell proliferation was carried out exactly the same manner with no T cells added to the culture. In all cases, cells were subsequently harvested onto filter paper using a multiple channel automated cell harvester Flow and washed repeatedly with distilled water.Cell associated radioactivity was deterxnined by scintillation counting in an automated counter. All of the results were expressed as 8 response calculated according to the formula cpm of supernatant treated cultures response . . x 100 cpm of control culturesEXAMPLE VCoculture experiments. Lymphocytes were treated at 3x106 cells ml with various dilutions of 6T 20SIF or growth mediun for 24 hours. Cells were washed extensively 3 to 4 times to remove residual 6T 2051F, after which they were set up in coculture as says with allogenic T and B cells at various concentrations indicated in reference toFigures 11 and 12.In T cell proliferation assay, various concentrations of cultured cells were added to 5x104 freshT cells in the presence of 0.18 PHA. In the T cell induced B cell proliferation assay, various concentrations of cultured cells were added to 2x104 T and 105 B cells in the presence of 1 64 dilution of PWM. In the B cell proliferation assay, various concentrations of cultured cells were added to 105 B cells in the presence of 1 64 dilution PWM. Cells were cultured for 4 days and 3H thymidine was added for the last 6 hours of the culture period. For one way mixed lymphocyte culture MLC experiments, various dilutions of cultured cells were added to 5x104 T lymphocytes stimulated with 104 mit C treated SB cells a human lymphoblastoid cell line obtained fromATCC, 30 vglml of mit C for 30 minutes .Cells were cultured for 5 days, 3H thymidine being added for the last 6 hours of the culture period. Cell harvesting was done as described above. The response was calculated according to the formula cpm of cocultures containing 6T 20SIF treated cells response x 100 cpm of cocultures containing corres ponding number of medium treated cellsEXAMPLE VIMixed lymphocyste culture MLC . Human 5x104 or 105 humanT lymphocytes were cultured with 105 mit C treated 30 pg nl per 107 cells for 30 minutes at 370C allogenic non rosetted cells, autologous non rosetted cells, or DBA spleen cells xenogenic cells for 5 days. 3H thymidine was added for the last 12 hours of the culture period. Mouse 2x105 C57 B6 spleen cells were cultured with 2x105 mit C treated DBA spleen cells for 5 days and 3H thymidine was added for the last 12 hours of the culture period.Percent response was calculated according to the same formula used for lymphocyte proliferation assays. For the coculture assays, various dilutions of T lymphocytes pretreatea with 6T 20SIF or medium were cocultured with 5x104 fresh T cells together with 104 mit C treated SB cells as stimulator cells. Cells were cultured for 5 days and 3H thymidine was added for the last 6 hours of the culture period. EXAMPLE VIICytotoxic T cell assay. Purified T lymphocytes were suspended at 106 nl in RPMI containing 5 human AB serum.100 p1 of cells were put into U bottom microtiter wells together with 104 mit C treated SB cells 30 tig mit C for 30 min. and various dilutions of TSF. After 3 days, 104 51Cr labeled SB cells were added to each well and the plates were spun at 1000 g for 10 min. After 4 hours of incubation at 370, 100 p1 of supernatant was removed and counted in a Beckman Gamma counter. The cytotoxicity was calculated using the following formula 51Cr released by SB cell stimulated cultures 51Cr released by unstimulated cultures cytotoxicity x 100 Total 51Cr released by lysed SB cellsEXAMPLE VIIIAcidification and alkalization.The cell free supernatant was acidified with 10 N HC1 or alkalized with 10 N NaOH for 30 minutes and then returned to neutral pH. Controls were set up consisting of medium substituted for the HC1 or NaOH.Heat inactivation 6T 20SIF was heat inactivated in a 56 C water bath for 30 minutes.Enzymatic digestion Trypsin was added to 6T 20SIF at a final concentration of 0.1 and incubated for 2 hours at 37 C. Enzymatic reaction was stopped by the addition ofFCS to a final concentration of 10 . Controls were set up consisting of medium substituted for. the trypsin. Ammonium sulfate precipitation. Cell free supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 minutes to remove any debris. Ammonium sulfate was then added gradually to give a final 50 ammonium sulfate saturation. After stirring for 45 minutes, the solution was centrifuged at 10,000 rpn for 30 minutes. The precipitate, which contained the suppressor activity, was exhaustively dialyzed againstPBS. All steps were carried out in the cold and the pH was maintained between pH 7.0 and pH 7.4.Chromatography on Sephacryle S 200 column. The 50 ammonium sulfate fraction containing the suppressor activity was further purified on a Sephacryle S 200 superfine column 2.5 cm x 50 cm . The column was equilibrated with phosphate buffered saline PBS and had a flow rate of 30 ml per hour. 2 ml of the dialzyed, 50 ammonium sulfate precipitated fraction was applied on the column. It was eluted with PBS and volumes of 5 ml were collected. The protein profile was followed by reading optical density at 280 nm.Production of suppressive supernatants by CEM, 6T CEM and its subclones Pig. 1 . 6T CEM, the thioguanine resistant mutant of the lymphoblastoid cell line CEM, secretes into the growth medium a high titered suppressive factor which inhibits T cell proliferation to PHA to the 95 level 10 10 experiments . Applicant has discovered that the parental line CEM used herein also secretes a suppressor factor, but the titer of this factor is about 1000 fold lower than the titer of SIF produced by 6T CEM. By subcloning 6T CEM, there was obtained one clone 6T CEM 20 which produced 10 fold higher suppressive activity than 6T CEM Fig. 1 . 6T CEM 20 has been showing stable levels of factor production for over 8 months. The supernatant of 6T CEM 20 is referred to herein as 6T 20SIF.The suppressive activity 50 response of 6T 20SIF has also been observed at a dilution of 10 9. The effect of 6T 20SIF on different subsets of T cells Fig. 2 . T cells were fractionated into OKT4 and OKT8 subpopulations by nonoclonal antibody mediated complement cytolysis. Dead cells were removed on a Ficoll Hypaque gradient. The purified cells were 95 viable and showed 90 95 purity as tested by fluorescent antibody labelling and measured by the ORTHO Spectrum III cytoflorometer.The differential effects of 6T 20SIF on OKT4 helper inducer and OKT8 suppressor cytotoxic subsets are shown in Fig. 2. 6T 20SIF suppressed equally well the proliferation of both the OKT4 and the OKT8 populations., 31 , 6T 20SIF did not suppress via a cytotoxic mechanism. ,The number of cells staining positively in the presence of trypan blue did not increase when cultured 3 7 days without mitogen or alloantigen.Effect of 6T 2OSIF on B cell proliferation Fig. 3 . The suppressive effect of 6T 20SIF on mitogen driven PWM B cell, T cell or B T cell proliferation was studied. 6T 20SIF suppressed B cell proliferation only at 10 1 dilution, whereas almost 100 suppression of T cell proliferation was observed at 10 5 dilution. T cell dependent B cell proliferation was partially suppressed by 6T 20SIF at 10 4 dilution. Similar results were obtained in two other experiments. 6T 20SIF did not suppress PWM induced Ig synthesis at 10 1 dilution.Time course of 6T 20SIF induced suppression Fig. 4,5 .In contrast to the marked suppression observed when 6T 20SIF was added at the initiation of the culture period, the suppressive effect of the same cell free supernatant was reduced drastically when added 24 hours later. No suppressive effect was observed when 6T 20SIF was added 48 hours after culture initiation. In order to obtain maximum suppression, it is important that the minimum culture period be 4 days. If 3H thymidine uptake was measured 3 days instead of 4 days after culture initiation, with 6T 205IF added at the beginning of the culture period, little suppression was observed.Continuous presence of 6T 20SIF during the complete culture period is not required, however, to achieve maximum suppression. T lymphocytes were treated with medium or 10 5 10 1 dilutions of 6T 20SIF at 107 cellslml for 8 to 24 hours at 37 . Cells were then washed 3 4 times and set up for PHA induced proliferation assay as described herein. As can beseen in Fig. 5, T lymphocytes that were in contact with 10 3 dilution of 6t 20sif for 8 hours or witch 10 4 dilution of 6T 20SIP for 24 hours did not proliferate in response to PHA stimulation.Effect of 6T 20SIF on one way mixed lymphocyte cultures Fig. 6,7 . 105 Human T cells were cultured with either 105 allogenic non rosetted cells, 2x105 DBA spleen cells, or 105 autologous non rosetted cells. Stimulated cells were treated with mit C to arrest proliferation. As can be seen from Fig. 6, 6T 20SIF at dilution of 10 5 suppressed the proliferative response of T lymphocytes to stimulation by alloantigen, xenoantigen and autoantigen. 6T 20SIF was also tested in a mouse spleen cell mixed lymphocyte culture experiment. 2x105 C57 B6 spleen cells were cultured with various concentrations of 6T 20SIF in the presence of 2x105 mit C treated DBA cells. The suppressive effect observed as shown in Fig. 7 was very similar to that of human lymphocytes. 6T 2oSIF thus does not exhibit species restriction.Effect of heat, acid, alkali and trypsin on the activity of 6T 20SIF Fig. 8,9 . As shown in Fig. 8, 2 hours incubation with trypsin removed about 90 of the activity of the factor. The factor is also sensitive to heat treatment, being inactivated by 30 minutes at 56 C. Titrating the supernatant to pH 2, 4, or 10 destroyed the activity completely, while the factor retained only 50 activity at pH 6 and pH 8.5. The factor seems to be most active at physiological pH 7.4 Fig. 9 .Sephacryls S 200 gel chromatography of 6T 20SIF Fig. 10 .200 ml of cell free supernatant was fractionated by a ammonium sulfate precipitation. The 50 ammonium sulfate fraction containing 90 958 of the activity was put. on aSephacryle S 200 column. As can be seen in Fig. 10, most of the suppressor activity came out in the first protein peak, indicating that the MW of the factor is around 110,000 dalton.Induction of suppressor cells by 6T 20SIF Fig. 11, 12 . T lymphocytes were incubated at 3x106 cells ml with different dilutions of 6T 2OSIF or growth medium for 24 hours. Cells were washed extensively and then set up in coculture experiments with 5x104 fresh allogenic T cells in a PHA induced proliferation assay or with 2.5x104 T cells and 105 B cells in a PWM induced T cell dependent B cell proliferation assay. As can be seen in Fig. 11, T lymphocytes exposed to 10 4 dilution of 6T 20SIF for 24 hours suppressed 90 95 T cell proliferation in a coculture assay suppression observed in 3 out of 3 experiments . T cell induced B cell proliferation was partially suppressed at around 10 2 dilution.The effect of 6T 20SIF treated T cells on fresh T cell proliferation in a one way mixed lymphocyte culture MLC stimulated by mit C treated SB cells is shown in Fig. 12. 6T 20SIF pretreated T cells suppressed T cell proliferation in a one way MLC in a dose related fashion with the pattern of suppression similar to the inhibition of mitogenic stimulation. Production of suppressor factor by 6T 20SIF treated lymphocytes Fig. 13, Table 5 . After 24 hours of exposure to 6T 20SIF or growth medium followed by extensive washing, T lymphocytes were set up at 1x106 cells ml inRPMI 2 FCS. Supernatants were harvested at various times to test for suppressor activities in a PHA induced T cell proliferation assay. Fig. 13 depicts the results of this time course experiment. Significant amounts of suppressor activity were released into the medium at 24 hours, there as production of T cell suppressor factor TSF reached maximum level at around 48 72 hours 3 out of 3 experiments .Production of TSF by different lymphoid populations and the effect of various treatments and culture conditions on the production are shown in Table 5. The purified T cell population is the major producer of TSF, while the depletion of residual adherent cells did not affect the amount of factor produced 2 out of 2 experiments . Both the OKT4 population and the OKT8 population are potent producers. A purified B cell population less than 0.1 of T cells produces about half of what purified T cells would have produced under the same culture condition 2 out of 2 experiments .Production of TSF shows serum dependency. Serum free medium did not support full production, whereas the presence of 2 FCS was sufficient for maximum secretion ofTSF by T lymphocytes. Mit C treatment and irradiation at 6000 R abolished almost completely the capacity of 6T 20SIF treated cells to elaborate TSF. Irradiation at 2000R or 3000 R caused only partial abolition of TSF production. Mechanism of action of TSF Fig. 14, Table 6 . The suppressive effects of TSF on PHA induced T cell proliferat ion, PWM induced T cell dependent B cell proliferation, and PWM induced B cell proliferation are shown in Fig. 14.TSF suppressed 85 90 PHA induced T cell proliferation at around 10 3 dilution but showed only partial suppress ion on T cell dependent B cell proliferation at 10 2 dilution.Proliferation of PWM stimulated B lymphocytes was only slightly suppressed, at 10 1 dilution 3 out of 3 experiments . Thus, the pattern of suppressive activities is comparable to that of 6T 20SIF. Similar to 6T 2051 , TSF has no suppressive effect on the generation of plaqueforming cells.The effect of TSF on the generation of cytotoxic T cells is shown in Table 6. The generation of cytotoxic T cells against the B cell lymphoblastoid cell line SB was not affected by TSF at concentrations as high as 10 t. 2 out of 2 experiments .The differential suppressive effects of TSF on various functional subsets of lymphocytes indicate that TSF suppresses via a noncytotoxic mechanism. This was further substantiated by studies showing that TSF did not augment the number of cells staining positively in the presence of trypan blue dye when cultured 3 5 days without mitogen 3 out of 3 experiments . Similar findings were also true for 6T 20SIF.Time course of TSF induced suppression Fig. 15 . TSF was added to a PHA induced T cell proliferation assay at various times after culture initiation. When added at mid culture period, suppressive activity was reduced by 50 , while no suppressive effect was observed when TSF was added at the last day of the culture period. The presence of TSF at the early phase of culture period is thus required for maximum suppression, which is similar to what was observed with 6T 20SIF. However, if TSF was added at the beginning of a culture period, there is little difference in percent suppression observed in a 3 or 4 dayPHA induced T cell proliferation assay. 6T 20SIF, on the other hand, did not show much suppressive effect on T cell proliferation in a 3 day lectin induced mitogenesis assay.A minimum of 4 day culture period is required for 6T 20SIF to exert maximum suppression.Inhibition of the suppressive activities by mono saccharides and indomethacin Fig. 16 . The suppressive effects of 6T 20SIF and TSF on PHA induced T cell proliferation were tested in the presence of 50 M of each of a methyl mannoside, fructose, NAG, or rhamnose, or 10 vg nl of indomethacin. As shown in Fig. 16, of all the monosaccharides tested, only rhamnose blocked the suppressive activities of ET 20SIF and TSF 2 out of 2 experiments . The prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor indomethacin has no effect on the suppressive activities of either thus prostaglandin like molecules do not seen to be involved in the mediation of suppression. Inhibition of delayed type hypersensitivity reaction by 6T 20SIF Fig. 17 . The in vivo effect of 6T 20SIF was evaluated by measuring the inhibition of delayed type hypersensitivity in mice. On day zero, C3H male mice were immunized with 0.2cc of a 0.0 1 solution of sheep red blood cells i.v. 2 x 105 cells mouse . On each of days 4 and 5, 50 p1 of a 10 solution of 6T 20SIF was injected into the left foot pad of each mouse. As a control, 50 pl of saline was also injected into the right foot pad of each mouse on each of days 4 and 5. On day 5, the mice were challenged in each foot pad with 30 p1 of a 20 solution of sheep red blood cells and foot pad measurements were made 24 hours later.As shown in Fig. 17, the delayed hypersensitivity reaction was significantly inhibited in mice receiving the 6T 20SIF. This example illustrates the in vivo utility of SIF to suppress undesired T cell proliferation.The subject 6 thioguanine resistant mutant of the human lymphoblastoid cell line CEM secretes constitutively into the growth medium high titered immunosuppressive factor.The cell free supernatant 6T 20SIF at dilutions as high as 10 9 suppressed at least 90 of T cell proliferation to both mitogenic and antigenic stimulations. T cell inducedB cell proliferation was suppressed only by lower dilutions of the supernatant 110 3 and mitogen stimulatedB cell proliferation was only partially affected at dilutions of 10 1.The parental line CEM also secretes into the growth medium low levels of previously uncharacterized suppressive factor. As shown by Vesole, dt al., CEM supernatant caused a 508 inhibition in mitogenically induced T cell proliferation at a dilution of 10 0.8. The parental CEM line used by Applicant was able to achieve the same degree of inhibition at a dilution of 5x10 3, although this fact was not previously known. By contrast, the subject mutant cell line and its most productive subclones are capable of showing this same degree of inhibition at dilutions of 10 6 and 10 9, respectively.This vast enhancement in SIF secretion by 6T CEM and its subclones over the parental cell line induced by 6 thioguanine appears not to be linked to deficiency in the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase IHGPRT since azaguanine resistant CEM which. is also deficient in HGPRr shows no enhancement in SIF production compared to the parental line CEM. Based on the state of the art as represented by Vesole, et al., and Irigoyen, et al., it is most surprising that one could make such a 6T sensitive mutant of CEM or any other cell line which would secrete such high titers ofSIF.As indicated previously, this vast enhancement in SIE production makes possible for the first time its purification and characterization.The cell free supernatant of 6T CEM 20, 6T 205IF, suppressed equally well the proliferation of both OKT4 and OKT8 populations to PHA stimulation. Allogenic, xenogen.c and autologous stimulation of T lymphocytes by mit C treated stimulated cells were suppressed in similar fashion as were mitogenic stimulation. 6T 20SIF did not exhibit species restriction since it also suppressed mouse spleen cell proliferation to both mitogenic and allogenic stimulations.In order to achieve maximum suppressive effects, 6T 20SIF is optimally present at the initiation of the culture period. No suppressive effect was observed when 6T 20SIF was added 48 hours after culture initiation, indicating that 6T 20SIF is probably involved in suppressing the early stages of mitogen induced proliferation with little or no effect on the terminal stages. The continuous presence of 6T 20SIF throughout the culture period is not required, since cells that had been exposed for 8 to 24 hours to 6T 20SIF did not respond to PW induced proliferation.This cannot be caused by the presence of residual 6T 20SIF, since the medium front the last wash contained no suppressive activity. 6T 20SIF suppressed more profoundly PHA induced T cell proliferation in a 4day culture than a 3 day culture, although the degree ofPHA induced proliferation in the absence of 6T 20SIF did not show significant differences between the two culture periods. These findings suggest that 6T 20SIF induces lymphocytes to secrete a second factor which is responsible for mediating the suppress ion observed.Partial purification by Sephacryle S 200 gel chromatography indicates that 6T 2OSIF is a high molecular weight protein of around 110,000 dalton. The activity and optical density profile did not change in the presence of mercaptoethanol or 0.1 M salt. SDS gel electrophoresis of the active fraction showed a major band of protein around 110,000 dalton.The irtiaiix 6 thioguanine resistant mutant of CEM secretes constitutively into its growth medium a suppressor inducer factor which induces human PBL to produce a T cell specific suppressor factor TSF . Neither factor exerts its suppressive effect by a cytotoxic mechanism since there were no differences in cell viability between suppressed and control cultures 3 to 5 days after incubation. By contrast, the prior art suppressor agent cyclosporin is highly toxic.The potent suppressive effect of 6T 20SIF on T cell proliferation is believed to be mediated via the induction of the lymphocyte specific TSF because 1 The targets of action are identical for the two factors. Both 6T 20SIF and TSF suppressed 90 95 T cell proliferation to mitogenic and antigenic stimulation at high dilutions of 10 9 and 10 3 respectively. T cell dependent B cell proliferation to mitogen was partially suppressed by both at lower dilutions of 10 4 and 10 2. Mitogenic induced B cell proliferation and B cell differentiation were not suppressed by either 2 The time course of suppression indicates that TSF and not 6T 20SIF is the immediate suppressor factor.When added at the time of culture initiation, TSF suppressed equally well T cell proliferation to PHA induced stimulation in a 3 or 4 day culture, whereas 6T 20SIF showed only partial suppression in a 3 day culture under the same conditions and maximum suppression was only observed in a 4 day culture. This observation can be explained by the fact that 6T 20SIF had to induce the elaboration of TSF from the lymphocytes which then mediated the appropriate suppression, resulting in a short lag period between culture initiation and the onset of suppression. Therefore, a minimum culture period of 4 days is required by 6T 20SIF for maximum suppress ion.As for TSF, direct suppress ion was exerted on lynphocytes at the initiation of the culture period and maximum suppress ion could be detected 72 hours later, the time when PHA induced T cell proliferation almost reached its maximum level under the culture conditions herein PHA induced proliferation usually peaked at day 4 3 The suppressive activities of both 6T 20SIF and TSF were blocked by the monosaccharide rhamnose but not by other monosaccharides such as fructose, NAG, or a methyl mannoside or by the prostaglandin inhibitor indomethacin. Since the presence of rhamnose did not affect the level of 6T 20SIF induced TSF production, it is unlikely that rhamnose blocked the lymphocyte suppressive activity of 6T 20SIF by interfering with its ability to induce TSF.Therefore, the target for rhamnose mediated blockage isTSF.It is unlikely that the TSF activity detected was due merely to residual 6T 20SIF that was bound loosely onto the lymphocyte surface and was then gradually released into the supernatant during the subsequent culture period, since lymphocytes that were treated with 30 pg ml of mit C after exposure to 6T 20SIF did not elaborate TSF into the growth medium. Lymphocytes that were irradiated at 20003000 R showed partial loss of TSF producing capabilities whereas 6000 R irradiation abrogated TSF production corpletely. It appears that active cellular metabolism is required for TSF synthesis.It is noteworthy that TSF suppressed 90 of T cell proliferation with little or no effect on the generation of cytotoxic T cells or T cell dependent Ig synthesis. This can be explained by the hypothesis that TSF suppressed mainly the rapidly proliferating population triggered by mitogenic or allogenic stimulation without affecting the functional activities of all the subsets. Studies with monoclonal antibodies indicate that while both OKT4 and OKT8 populations respond equally well to allogenic and mitogenic stimulations, only a subset within the OKT8 population wouldPbecome cytotoxic effector cells upon stimulation by class I MHC antigens 22 . Reinherz, et al., 23 and Thomas, et al., 24 also demonstrated that only a minor subset within the OKT4 population is responsible for providing helper activity to B cells to produce Ig.It is likely that the functional properties of these particular subsets were not affected by TSF.It appears that TSF inhibits synthesis of interleukin 2 IL 2 receptors in suppressed mouse T cells but does not inhibit IL,2 production. This observation may explain the results described herein.The functional characteristics of TSF distinguish it quite clearly from other soluble factors produced by lymphocytes during Concanavalin A con A or PWM stimulation 25 27 .Firstly, it suppresses predominantly T cell proliferation with little or no effect of B cell proliferation or Ig secretion. Secondly, it suppresses T cell proliferation in an MLC assay but does not affect the generation of cytotoxic T cells in the same experiment. Thirdly, the concentration of TSF required to produce maximum suppres , sion on T cell proliferation is much lower than other soluble factors described so far 10 3 as compared to 1 2 or 1 10 dilutions .Most of the known immunosuppressive factors secreted by human T cells suppress B cell differentiation. GroillotCourvalin, et al., 15 recently constructed a human T T hybridoma secreting a suppressor factor which suppressedPWM induced B cell differentiation but did not inhibit PWM induced T or B cell mitogenesis. Fleisher, et al., 28 also reported the production of immune suppressor supernate of B cells SISS B that suppressed Ig production with no suppressive effects on cell mediated immune response, i.e., MLC and the generation of cytotoxic T cells. These data suggest that T cell derived B cell specific suppressor factors are distinct molecules from T cell specific suppressor factor.Two of the more well characterized lymphocyte derived suppressor factors of T cell proliferation are human soluble suppressor of T cell proliferation SISS T 25 and lipid suppressor substance LSS 29 . SISS T was secreted by PBL upon activation by concanavalin A Con A , had a MW of 30 45,000 dalton and suppressed mitogenic and antigenic stimulated T cell proliferation at around 1 10 dilution. SISS T had little effect on B cell proliferation and differentiation. The suppressive activity ofSISS T was blocked by the monosaccharide MAG but not by rhamnose, a methyl mannoside, or frucose. SISS T was partially inactivated at 56e but stable during prolonged exposure to acid or base.LSS was secreted constitutively by an uncloned human cell line established from a cutaneous T cell lymphoma 29 and was active at 1 1000 dilution. A similar material was secreted by antigenactivated conventional cultures of human T cells, which was active at 1 10 dilution. It appears that TSF is dissimilar to SISS T since TSF is not stable in prolonged exposure to acid or base and has a much larger molecular weight. TSF suppressed 90 95 T cell proliferation at 10 3 dilution whereas SISS T inhibited 40 708 T cell proliferation at 10 1 dilution. Furthermore, since the suppressive activity of TSF is blocked by rhamnose and notNAG, TSF and SSIS T are probably binding to different receptors on T cell surface. LSS is a lipid like substance extracted from serum or growth medium by ethanol.We know from our preliminary purification study that TSF is a protein or glycoprotein like molecule which precipitated out in the 50 ammonium sulfate fraction. 6T 20SIF is also different from the proliferation inhibitory factor PIF secreted by PHA activated lymphocytes 8,9 . The activity of PIF is limited to the cells of the same species from which PIF is derived, whereas 6T 20SIF exhibits no species restriction. 6T 20SIF suppresses, with similar potency, both human PBL and mouse spleen cell proliferation to allogenic stlInlation. Supernatants from mitogen activated lymphocytes usually contain a spectrum of biologically active soluble mediators like migration inhibitory factor MIF 2,3 , lymphotoxin 4,5 and interferon 10,30 . The functional characteristics, the biochemical and biophysical properties preclude the possibility that TSF is identical to any of the molecules mentioned above. It should be noted that 6T 20SIF is the only non mitogenic suppressor inducer material known, in contrast to such prior art materials asPHA. The functional characteristics, the biochemical and biophysical properties of TSF clearly distinguish it from other suppressor factors described in the literature.Thus, both 6T 205F and TSF are unique factors. Information relating to the production of the particular mutant cell line and subclones, as well as their properties, are given in the following Tables.

Kammer et al. in the Journal of Immunology, Volume 130, page 1706 1983 R.S.Krakauer et al. in ClinicalImmunology And Immunopathology, Volume 14, page 327 1979 and D.B. Kaufman, et al. in Clinical Immunology and Immunopathology, Volume 13, page 9 1979 .The 6 thioguanine resistant mutant of the human lymphoblastoid cell line CEM secretes a high titered immunosuppressive factor referred to herein as SIF which suppresses via inducing human T lymphocytes to secrete a T cell suppressor factor TSF. This endogenous suppressor factor is probably, by far, more active than any T cell suppressor factor ever described in the literature. It is reasonable to expect that such an endogenous factor may play an important physiological role in regulating the immune response. It has now been found that the SIF of the present invention may be used to accurately and precisely diagnose rheumatoid arthritis in humans. This can be done in a relatively simple, inexpensive and fast procedure as described below.ProtocolThe following protocol takes into account fluctuation inTSF production among normals by different age groups, dayto day variability in responses to SIF among normal individuals and the consistency of the testing itself., In general, this protocol involves taking whole blood from the subject1 isolating the nononuclear white cells and rosetting the mononuclear cells with sheep red blood cells SRBC to isolate the E erythrocyte rosetting cells and testing production of TSF by the E cells after induction with the SIF of the invention the A test and testing the response of an identical sample of E cells after incubation with both SIF and TSF referred to as theB test . The B test is used to be certain that the particular patient being evaluated is not a non responder to the pati ent s own TSF.1. 40 ml of heparinized blood is spun down at 1500 g 1500 times normal gravity for 10 minutes.2. The buffy coat is removed and layered onto a FicollHypaque gradient 7 ml of buffy coat to 5 its of FicollHypaque . The tubes are then spun at 1500 g for 30 minutes.3. Mononuclear cells at the interface are removed and washed 3 times with phosphate buffer saline PBS .4. Washed nononuclear cells are suspended in RPMI 1640 medium and 10 fetal calf serum FCS at 5xl06 per rani. 1 ml of 0.18 neuraminidase treated SRBC is added to 5 ml of mononuclear cells and the mixture is allowed to sit for about 20 minutes. The tube is spun at 1000 g for 20 minutes over a Ficoll Hypaque gradient.5. The non rosetted cells B lymphocytes and monocytes and adherent cells will be at the interface and the rosetted cells T lymphocytes will be in the pellet together with the SRBC. T iymphocytes are then recovered from the pellet by lysing SRBC with ammonium chloride.The T lymphocytes are washed 3 times with PBS. 6. Washed T lymphocytes are divided into 2 parts, one for production of TSF by SIF induction the A test and one for testing the response of the lymphocytes to standard preparations of SIF or TSF the B test .7. The A test For testing the production of TSF, 3x106T lyRphocytes are incubated with growth medium RPMI and 10 FCS or with 5x10 2 dilution of the column purifiedSIF. The production of SIF is described in Example II of the present specification and the column purification ofFractogel is described below. 24 hours after incubation, the cells are washed 3 times with PBS and resuspended inRPMI 1640 and 10 FCS at 106 cells per ml. The supernatants containing TSF are collected three days later and the TSF activities induced by SIF are tested in a PaA induced T cell proliferation assay as described in num 9 below on the same day using normal donor s lymphocytes as responders.Chromatography on Fractogel, TSK HW 55 F column The 50 ammonium sulfate cut containing the suppressor activity SIF is further purified on a Fractogel, TSK HW55 F column 2.5 cm x 50 cm . The column is equilibrated with w MEM and has a flow rate of 30 ml per hour. 2 ml of the dialyzed, 50 ammonium sulfate precipitated fraction is applied on the column. It is eluted with the buffer aMEM. 4 ml fractions are collected. The protein profile is followed by reading optical density at 280 nanometers and the suppressive activity is monitored using the PHAinduced T cell proliferation assay described below in 9. 8. The B test For testing the response to.standard preparations of SIF and TSF, T lymphocytes from patients are suspended at 106 per ml in RPMI 1640 and 10t FCS and responses to SIF or TSF are tested in a PHA induced T cell proliferation assay as described in 9 below with the patients T lymphocytes as responders.9. PHA induced T cell proliferation T lymphocytes are suspended at 106 cells per ml in RPMI 1640 and 108 FCS.These T lymphocytes are obtained from normal individuals and have been prescreened for a reproducible responses toTSF. 100 microliters of cells are put into each well of aU bottom microtiter plate. Various dilutions of TSF for the A test and SIF or TSF for the B test are added to each well in 20 microliter volume. 80 microliters of 1 400 dilution of PHA P Wellcome are added to each well.Plates are incubated for 4 days and 3H thymidine is added 4 5 hours before cell harvesting by the Flow cell harvester. Three replicates are set up for each dilution of TSF or SIF. In every assay, SIF and TSF of known activities are run simultaneously with unknown samples for standardization purposes.10. Data Analysis All samples are counted in anIntertechnique Scintillation Counter. Data is recorded on paper tapes which are processed by computer, The computer output shows the mean and standard deviation SD of 3H thymidine uptake of the 3 replicates, and the 4 response is calculated according to the formula 8 response cpm of TSF or SIF treated cultures cpm of medium treated cultures x 100. The response is.then plotted against the appropriate dilutions of TSF or SIF used for inducing the suppression and the best fit line will be drawn through the data points constituting the slope.The dilution of TSF or SIF suppressing the response by 50 is then calculated, The slope is considered to be equal to the formula slope S Y1 Y2 X1 X2 wherein Y1 is, loo , X1 is 0, Y2 is 50 and X2 is the dilution giving 50 suppression. 11. 10 to 15 normal donors from each of the following age groups were tested 20 40, 41 50 and 51 65. Selected normals will be tested every month to assess day to day variations. in responses among normal individuals and the consistency of the assay.Blood samples from 32 normal individuals and 6 individuals with rheumatoid arthritis were tested according to the above described protocol. The results are shown in the following Table 7 and demonstrate that the TSF activity of patients with rheumatoid arthritis is significantly lower than that obtained from normals of a similar age group, i.e., median 9 x 10 2 as compared as to 8.5 to 9 x 10 4 . In general, the concentration of TSF necessary to produce a 50 suppression of T cell proliferation in this test for a patient with rheumatoid arthritis is at least tenfold higher than the concentration of TSF produced from a normal individual. Thus, the SIF produced according to the present invention has been shown to be useful in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. In summary, this aspect of the present invention comprises a method of diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis in a human subject which comprises i treating T lymphocytes from the blood of the subject with a standard and effective T cell suppressor factor inducing concentration of the suppressor inducer factor of the present invention, ii determining the activity of the produced T cell suppressor factor, and iii comparing the activity of the T cell suppressor factor found in step ii with control values of T cell suppressor activity induced by the supressor inducer factor of the present invention which controls are obtained from human normals and humans known to have rheumatoid arthritis.

The cellular basis for such transplant phenomenon is described inChapter 4 of The Cellular Basis of the Immune Response , second edition, by Edward S. Golub, Sinauer Associates,Sunderland, Massachusetts 1981 . Both responses pose serious problems for the host recipient of the grafted tissue. References include R. Korngold et al in theJ. Exp. Med. pages 1687 1698, volume 148 December 1978 , the article Infectious Complications of Human Bone MarrowTransplantation by D.J.Winston et al in Medicine, pages 1 31, Vol. 58, No. 1 1979 and Bone Marrow Transplantation in the New England Journal of Medicine, pages 895902, Vol. 292, No. 17 1975 . The suppressor inducer factor of the present invention may be used in vitro to treat a donor tissue, e.g., bone marrow, to decrease or eliminate GvHD in the recipient host and can also be used to reduce or eliminate allograft rejection, e.g., by in vivo administration.Prevention of GvHD In Bone Marrow Transplantation ImmuneIncompetent Host In bone marrow transplantation, bone marrow is withdrawn from a histocompatible donor BLA compatible or identical and mixed lymphocyte culture matched and implanted, e.g., injected intravenously, into the host. Usually, this involves use of bone marrow from a donor to a sibling host.The reason for the transplantation of bone marrow is either the presence in the host of malignant cells in the immune system, e.g., in acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute non lymphocytic leukemia or chronic Eyelogenous leukemia, or congenital blood disease, e.g., aplastic anemia or severe combined immune deficiency, and the therapy is replacelaent of them bone marrow stem cells with healthy cells from the donor. Thus, prior to transplant, the bone marrow is destroyed, usually by total body irradiation. Maturation of the transplanted cells will gradually replace both the lymphoid and hemopoietic systems of the host.It has been found that immature stem cells, the precursors of lymphoid cells and red cells which are transplanted will not recognize the host tissues as foreign and will mature into functionally useful cells for the host. The problem comes about when mature T cells are carried along with the grafted bone marrow. Once in the host they proceed to attack the host as foreign causing GvDH. A method has not yet been devised for separating the desirable immature stem cells in the graft from the mature T cells.When the mature T cells in the graft from the donor are implanted in the host, the suppressor type T cells are the first to be activated and this situation results in severe immunosuppression and possibly interference with the maturation of the desirable immature stem cells resulting in what is termed Acute GvHD . Acute GvED lasts for about one hundred days and can be treated by the administration of chemotherapeutic and immunomodulating agents such as methothrexate, heterologous antithymocyte globulin, corticosteroids and cyclosporin A. These agents are selected for their inhibitory effect on functional T lymphocytes. However, such non specific agents must be given for several months after the transplant and adverse side effects include hepatic and renal toxicity. Chronic GvHD occurs about one hundred days after bone marrow transplantation and is thought to be caused by proliferation of mature helper T lymphocytes from the donor. Such helper cells then attack the host and the host will exhibit symptoms similar to progressive systemic sclerosis, lupus or Sjbgren s syndrome. Prom the above description of acute and chronic GvHD, it can be seen that a primary goal in bone marrow transplant research is the destruction or separation of matureT cells from the donor from the desirable iirLtnature stem cells. Attempts have been made to treat the graft with monoclonal anti T cell antibodies including the monoclonal antibodies known as OKT 3 and OKT 11 described in U.S. Patents 4,361,549 and 4,364,937, respectively. The use ofOKT 3 in bone marrow transplantation is described byA.H. Filipovich et al. in the article Pretreatment ofDonor Bone Marrow With Monoclonal Antibody OKT 3 forPrevention of Acute Graft versus Host Disease in AllogenicHistocompatible Bone Marrow Transplantation in TheLancet, pages 1266 1269, June 5, 1982. With OKT 3, it was confirmed that almost all immunocompetent T lymphocytes in the bone marrow samples were coated with OKT 3 at the time of infusion. However, complement which is necessary to lyse the cells after being coated with OKE 3, could not be used since rabbit complement which would bind effectively is known to be toxic to human hemopoietic cells and would adversely affect the engraftment. As stated in the Lancet article, ...further modifications for bone marrow pretreatment will be needed to achieve effective prophylaxis against acute GvHD in histocompatible bonemarrow transplantation . Against the above background, it has been found that the suppressor inducer factor of the present invention effectively reduces the complications of transplantation of tissue into immunologically incompetent hosts. Thus, another aspect of the present invention is in the method for transplanting bone marrow from a donor mammal to a zn mmal which comprises the steps of destroying the thone marrow of the host, e.g., by irradiating the host mammal withdrawing the bone marrow graft from the donor ,mammal and implanting, e.g., injecting, the graft tissue into the host, the improvement which comprises treating the graft tissue, e.g., in vitro, with the suppressor inducer factor of the invention.This method is particularly suited to the transplantation of bone marrow, e.g., in humans. This method is demonstrated by the following experimentation. Materials and Methods Mice To demonstrate the efficacy of the suppressor inducer factor of the present invention in bone marrow transplantation, it is necessary to use as a model, a system wherein any significant number of mature T cells transplanted into the host would cause an acute GvED reaction and wherein the genotype haplotype of the surviving host could be analyzed to determine whether the engraftment has taken place. A healthy surviving host with the genotype of the donor in the hemopojetic and lymphoid systems would indicate the success of the transplant since such could not be possible unless acute GvHD had been eliminated. The H 2 complex is a linked series of genes in a small segment of chromosoms 17 of the mouse. For the present experimentation, the offspring F1 from C57BL 6 H 2b and DBA 2 H 2d parents designated by the strain B6D2F1 H 2b d was used as the host recipient. One of its parents C57BL 6 was used as the donor. Mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories of Bar Harbor, Maine and were 8 10 weeks old at the start of the experiment.The host mice were irradiated with 137Cs at a dose of 102 rads per minute for a total dose of 950 rads.Cell Suspension Bone marrow suspensiqns were obtained by aspirating phosphate buffered saline through the marrow cavities of femors of donor mice. Cells were washed three times in RPMI and suspended in RPMI 10 fetal calf serum for treatment.SIF The dialyzed 508 ammoniura sulfate fraction of the suppressor inducer factor of the present invention described in Example VIII was prepared. The control supernatant was a 50 ammonium sulfate fraction was prepared from the Az CEM line described in Table 3 above.The control supernatant showed no detectable suppressive effect on T cell proliferation.Procedure Bone marrow cells from the donor mouse were removed and suspended at 5 x 106 cells per ml of RPMI and incubated with the suppressor inducer factor or control supernatant in an amount of 1 300 v v SIF cells for twenty four hours. The cells were then washed two times and 2.5 x 107 parental bone marrow cells were injected intravenously into the recipient through the tail vein.Sixty five days after transplantation, the genotype or haplotype of the surviving mice was determined by the method described in Humoral and Cell Mediated ImmuneResponses in Fully Allogenic Bone Marrow Chimera Mice byF.G. OnoE in J. Exp. Med., page 115, volume 151 1980 .The results obtained are shown in the following Table 8. Table 8 SURVIVAL TIME POST Mouse TRANSPLANTATION GENOTYPE ON DAYS DAY 65Control Super 1 35 natant Treated 2 39 Graft 3 45 mean 39.6 5SIF Treated Graft 4 60 958 H2b 5 60 95 H2b 6 60 95 H2b mean r 60As can be seen in the above Table 8, all animals from the control group n 3 died within 45 days whereas the group receiving bone marrow treated with SIF n 3 survived beyond 60 days. Further, the weights uf the SIF treated animals did not decrease after transplantation and their physical condition remained good throughout the entire study.In contrast, at 20 days posttransplantation, the control mice started to lose weight and appeared to be in poor physical condition. Use of theSIF in an amount of 1 10,000 v v or less only reduced theT cell proliferation by about 90 . However, use of theSIF in an amount of 1 1000 v v or greater, e.g., 300 as above or 1 100 or 1 500, produced a decrease in T cell proliferation of about 958 or more. Thus, the SIF is used in the present invention in bone marrow transplantation preferably in an amount of at least about 1 1000 v v SIF cells , 2.Allograft Rejection Immune Competent Host As previously described, grafting of tissue fron a donor to an immune competent host, e.g., kidney, heart, liver or lung transplantation, poses significant problems in that the immune system of the host attacks the graft.Immunosuppressive drugs may be toxic to the host and a need exists for a non toxic immunosuppressive material which allows the host to gradually accept the graft without destroying it in the interim. A further aspect of the present invention is a method for transplanting tissue from a donor to a host mammal where the host is imnu,.nologically competent which comprises the steps of removing the tissue from the donor mammal and implanting the tissue in the host while suppressing the immunological response of the host with the administration of the suppressor inducer factor of the present invention. While the amount of the suppressor inducer factor of the present invention can be titrated by the attending physician, the amount utilized will generally be in the range of about 0.1 to 1.0 ml of the 50 ammonium sulfate precipitated suppressor inducer factor described in Example VIII above per kilogram of body weight of the host per day. Such an amount of suppressor inducer factor of the present invention would be administered starting about one day before the transplant and daily thereafter for about two weeks. REFERENCES 1.
