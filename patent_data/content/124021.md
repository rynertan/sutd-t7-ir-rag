# Magnetic toner.

## Abstract
A magnetic toner comprises magnetic powder and a coat ing layer to cover said powder, the layer being a reaction pro duct between 1 a silane coupling agent containing an amino group, an isocyanate group or an epoxy group and 2 one or more compounds having a functional group reactive with one of the reactive group on the silane coupling agent. A com pound having a carboxyl group, an acid anhydride, an isocya nate compound or a ketene dimer is used for the amino group. A compound having a hydroxyl group, an amino compound or a compound having a carboxyl group is used for the isocya nate group. A compound having a hydroxyl group, a com pound having a carboxyl group or a copolymer of a di or mo noalkylamino alkyl meth acrylate and a hydrophobic vinyl monomer is used for the epoxy group. The magnetic toner is improved about dispersibility in a binder.
