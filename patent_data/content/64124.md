# Antitheft device for trailers and semitrailers.

## Abstract
The device 20 comprises a threaded rod 21 which can be screwed in a block integral to a fixed portion of the trailer or semitrailer 1 and has one end thereof idly engaged in a body integral to a linkage 24, 29, 30, 35 leading to the levers which actuate the brakes 3 of an axle of the trailer or semitrailer 1 . By screwing or unscrewing the threaded rod 21 in said block it is possible to achieve the locking or the releasing of brakes 3 . When brakes 3 are in their locking position, acting on a latch control member operable by means of a key it is possible to engage one end of the latch within an annular groove formed in the threaded rod, so that the latter is prevented from moving axially. During this stage the other end of the latch acts on a non return valve 49 connected to the service brake circuit in order to allow the brake fluid to flow in one direction only.
