# Resin encapsulation type semiconductor device by use of epoxy resin composition.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a resin encapsulation type semicon ductor device having a semiconductor element and a resinous encapsulating material for encapsulating said semi conductor element therein, said resinous encapsulating material comprising a cured product of an epoxy resin composition for encapsulation of semiconductor, com prising a 100 parts by weight of an epoxy resin b 5 to 500 parts by weight of a curing agent having at least two phenolic hydroxyl groups in one molecule c 0.01 to 20 parts by weight of an organic phosphine compound and d 0.1 to 100 parts by weight of at least one antimony oxide selected from the group consisting of diantimony tetroxide, hexaantimony tridecaoxide and diantimony pento xide. The resin encapsulation type semiconductor device according to the present invention has high reliability in thermal cycle resistance, humidity resistance and the like.
