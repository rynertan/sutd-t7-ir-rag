# Noise reduction in electrical signals.

## Abstract
Reduction of noise in an electrical, e.g. television, signal is achieved by comparing signals from successive scans to produce a difference signal. Low amplitude differences are assumed to represent noise and are attenuated. Differences above a predetermined level are assumed to represent movement and are not so attenuated. The attenuation is achieved by a multiplier 26 which receives as multiplier the output of a non linear transfer characteristic element 24 . The non linear element receives the differences after rectification 100 and after passing through a variable gain element 102 . The non linear element 24 is such that above a predetermined value a constant predetermined minimum attenuation factor applies. A noise measurement circuit X measures the noise present in the difference signal and controls the gain of the variable gain element 102 accordingly. Several noise measurement circuits may be provided, a selected one of which is used in dependence upon the magnitude of the input signal to the apparatus.
