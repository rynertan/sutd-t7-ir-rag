# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR CRYOPREPARING BIOLOGICAL TISSUE FOR ULTRASTRUCTURAL ANALYSIS

## Abstract
This invention relates to apparatus for the cryo preparation of biological tissue samples for ultrastructural analysis. The use of the apparatus comprises vitrifying a biological tissue sample under cryogenic temperature condi tions and ultra low vacuum conditions. The depressurized, vitrified tissue sample is brought to equilibrium in a sample holder at a temperature of less than 140 C. The tissue sample is then dehydrated while maintained in a state of thermal equilibrium. After reaching equilibrium the tissue sample is optionally infiltrated with a degassed resin follow ed by a polymerization of the resin to form an embedded tissue sample.
