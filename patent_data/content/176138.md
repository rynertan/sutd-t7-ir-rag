# Television transmitter.

## Abstract
A television transmitter comprises a video signal input 1 feeding a modulator 2 , a pre corrector 3 , an up converter 4 and power amplification stages 5, 6 . The stage 6 , typically a Klystron amplifier, is operated in a non linear mode to increase efficiency and the pre corrector 3 is provided to provide a correction for the output amplifier stage non linearity. A portion of the output signal is coupled to a demodulator 8 whose output is fed to measurement means 9 . The measurement means 8 measures the distortion of the output, for example non linearity, differen tial gain, etc., and applies a signal to a computer 11 via an interface circuit 10 . The computer then calculates control signals which are applied through the interface circuit 10 to the pre corrector 3 . The control signals are effective to vary the transfer characteristic of the pre corrector circuit 3 in such a manner as to reduce the output distortion to a minimum value.
