# Fire control system for a vehicle or vessel.

## Abstract
In a fire control system for a vehicle or vessel a data processor 21 connected to the target tracking unit 7 determines, in a first coordinate system coupled to said unit 7 , angular error data about a target position for aligning 12, 13 the tracking unit 7 with the target position. A fire control computer 22 is incorporated for a. determining 24 matrix H elements concerning the transformation from the first coordinate system to a second fixed horizontal coordinate system, using data about relative angular positions between the tracking unit 7 , the vehicle or vessel and a turret mounted thereon, and using data from reference orientation means 18, 19, 20 about the angular positions in said second coordinate system b. converting 26 the angular error data into target posi tions in said second coordinate system c. changing 23 said target positions to gun aiming data and d. transforming 27 the latter data to a third coordinate system coupled to the vehicle or vessel.
