# Method and apparatus for converting sequentially produced light into output light comprised of periodic high amplitude pulses.

## Abstract
A steady light beam such as continuous wave, constant amplitude coherent light as provided by a laser 10 , is moved through a given acute angle α at a given frequency. The light beam is passed into a solid body 17 of light transmissive material while moving through the given acute angle α such that the initially received light in the body when the beam starts its movement through the acute angle follows a first path 25 of a first given length before it emerges from the body. Subsequently received light in the body when the beam has completed its movement through the acute angle α , in turn, follows a second path 27 of a second given length different from the first given length before it emerges from the body 17 . The referred to fre quency is adjusted to define a time increment for the beam to move through the referred to given acute angle α . This time increment is made substantially equal to the time it takes light to travel a path length in the body equal to the differ ence in the referred to first and second given lengths. With such an arrangement, the light beams entering the body at the extremes of the acute angle α will exit or emerge from the body 17 coincidentally in time thereby resulting in a high amplitude pulse. These high amplitude pulses are gen erated at the frequency of movement of the beam through the referred to acute angle. A similar effect is achieved using a plurality of individual pulse lasers arranged to be succes sively triggered at predetermined time intervals. The solid light transmissive body 17 receives the output pulses from the lasers at different input angles so that the respective pulses follow different path lengths in the body. The sequ ence of firing of the lasers and the respectively angles are such that pulses exiting from the body will all exit substan tially simultaneously. The result is a high energy concentra tion of output light.
