## Description
TIN OR TIN LEAD ALLOY ELECTROPLATING BATHBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a tin or tinlead alloy electroplating bath. Prior Art In the past, a sulfate or borofluoride bath has been used as a tin plating bath and a borofluoride bath has been used as a tin lead alloy plating bath. However, borofluorides are compounds which form wasteproducts, thereby causing pollution problems unless the waste liquids are pre treated before they are discharged. However, it is required a lot of expenses for the running cost and installation investment for processing the waste liquids discharged from the borofluoride containing electrolyte and for processing the rinsing water used to rinse the plated products. Further difficulties are encountered in maintenance of the installatin or equipment, and additionally the materials for the equipment are limited5 because borofluorides have intense corrosive actions. Furthermore, the,use of borofluorides is not preferred from the environmental and health point of view because harmful gas is generated during the processing. On the other hand, a variety of electroplating baths containing no borofluorides such as a bath containing a sulfate, a pyrophosphate or a sulfamate as the primary component have been proposed. However, these known electroplating baths are not satisfactory when used as the bath in which tin or a tin lead alloy is deposited, because they have poor uniform electrodeposition properties as regards uniform deposition and hardly give, a smooth and dense deposited coating.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is, therefore, a primary object of this invention to provide a composition for use in an electroplating liquid for depositing tin or a tin lead alloy to form an electroplated coating having excelleslt properties. Another object of this invention is to provide the composition as aforementioned which does not cause any pollution or health problem. The composition provided by this invention comprises 1 a stannous salt or a mixture of a stannous salt and a lead salt, ii at least one compound selected from the group consisting of gluconic acid, glucoheptonic acid, alkali metal salts of gluconic acid and glucoheptonic acid, glucouic lactone and glucoheptonic lactone, and iii a surface active agent. According to a further advantageous feature of this invention, hydrazine or a salt thereof is added to the aforementioned composition.DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The tin and lead salts used in the present invention are not specifically limited, and are those which are generally used in a tin or a lead electropatig bath. Representative examples of the stannous salt include stannous chloride, stannous sulfate and stannous acetate and representative examples of the lead salt include lead nitrate, lead acetate and lead carbonate. The amousit of said metal salts used in the electroplating liquid may be in the range of from 1 to 40 g l, preferably 5 to 20 g l, of metallic tin and 0.5 to 40 g l, preferably 1 to 15 g l, of metallic lead.Preferably,the total amount of metallic tin and lead may be not more than 50 g l. If the content of the metal salts exceeds the aforementioned range, the viscosity of the liquid is increased, which results in increase in the volume of the entrained liquid, which is unecoiiomical. Examples of the alkali salts of gluconic acid and glucoheptonic acid used in this invention include sodium gluconate, potassium gluconate, sodium glucoheptonate and potassium glucoheptonate. The term lactone used in this specification and appended claims means a compound having an ester functional group in the ring, and it is classified into lactone, r lactones, 6 lactones and the like according to the number of the ring constituting atoms. A compound having an intramolecular hydroxy group and an intramolecular carboxylic group, such as gluconic acid or glucoheptonic acid, readily forms an intramolecular ester or a lactone by heating or other means.In an aqueous solution, free gluconic acid, and 6 lactolles can exist only in the form of an equilibrium mixture of the three compounds. The composition of the equilibrium mixture in an aqueous solution varies depending on solvent, pH, concentration, temperature and so on. A similar phenomenon is observed with glucoheptonic acid. A suitable amount of gluconic acid, glucoheptoslic acid, salts thereof or mixtures thereof ranges from 50 to 300 g l, preferably 100 to 200 g l. If the amount is less than 50 g l, the applicable range of the cuIrb density for obtaining a dense plated coating becomes narrower whereas it is uneconomical to increase the amount to more than 300 g l because no further improvement in the properties of plated coating is obtained. According to the present invention, a surface active agent is used to act effectively to deposit.finely divided particles to form a dense coating1 whereby the formation of branch shaped or sponge like coating and the formation of pits or pin holes are suppressed.specific examples of the .aniaiic surfape active agents used in the present invention are puuEerably sulfates of Polyoxyethylenealkyl ethers having 2 to 4 moles of added ethylene oxide per molecule. Suitable non ionic surface active agents include polyoxyethylenealcohol ethers, polyoxyethylenealkylphenol ethers, esters of polyoxyethylenealiphatic acids and polyoxyethylenepolypropylene block polymers, the preferable molar number of the added ethylene oxide being not less than 8. Examples of preferred catianic surface active agent are polyoxyethylene adducts of aliphatic amine and polyoxyethylene adducts of amides, each having not less than 8 moles of the added ethylene oxide. Any one of the aforementioned surface active agents may be used singly, or two or more of them may be used in combination. The suitable ccntit thereof ranges between 0.05 and 20 g l, preferably between 1 and 10 g l.If the content is less than 0.05 g l, the effect for obtaining a dense plated coating attained by the addition of surface active agent does not reach a satisfactorylevel whereas, in case of more than 20 g l, no further improvement in the properties of the resultant coating can be realized with the attehdant disadvantage that the foaming tendency of the bath is exceedingly increased. In a further preferred embodiment of this invention, hydrazine or a salt thereof is added to prevent divalent tin from being oxidizing to tetravalent tin with theconcur rent advantage that the formation of a braKh flaped coating at high current density portion can be eliminated whereby a dense played coating can be obtained. A further advantageous effect obtainable by the addition of surface active agents is that the anode or positive electrode made of tin or an tin lead alloy is prevented from being converted into a passive state, and that the solubility of the anode and the conductivity of the electroplating liquid are improved. The suitable content of hydrazine or of a salt thereof ranges from 2 to 100 g l, preferably from 10 to 50 g l. The advantageous effects are not obtained satisfactorily if the content is less than 2 g l, whereas no additional improvement in the properties of the formed coating is recognized even if the content exceeds 100 g l. The suitable pH value of the electroplating liquid according to this invention ranges from 2.0 to 10.0, preferably 3.0 to 7.0. If the pH value, is lower than 2.0 or higher than 10, it becomes difficult to obtain a deuse coating. Any known alkaline comuunds or acids, Such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, aqueous ammonia or hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, may be used to adjust the pH value if desired.The suitable cathode current density ranges from 0.1 to 6 A dmÃª, preferably from 1 to 3 A dm2 The suitable temperature of the bath rages from 20 to 60 C, preferably 30 to 55 C. It is preferred that the bath is agitated by fluidization agitation means using, for instance, a cathode rocker. Air agitation is nst possible since the salt of tin II is oxidized to the corresponding salt of tin IV . An anode made of tin is used in the the tinelectr o plating and an anode made of an alloy of tin and lead which has the same composition as that of the deposited coating to be formed is used in the tin lead alloy electroplating. The tin or tin lead alloy electroplating liquid according to this invention has the advantage that, as compared to the conventional fluoroborate bath, it requires easier operations for treating the waste liquid and has no corrosive property. The electroplating liquid of this invention is also improved in that the plated coating formed is superior in uniformity, and that the resultant deposited coating forms a semigloss surface which is smooth and dense and has no pits or pin holes. In the tin lead alloy electroplatilsg bath of this inventio, the composition of the resultant deposited coating can be easily controlled by simply varying the ratio of the metallic components, i.e. the ratio of tin to lead, in the electroplating liquid, with an additional advantage that the fluctuation in composition of the plated alloy due to the change in current density is minimized.
