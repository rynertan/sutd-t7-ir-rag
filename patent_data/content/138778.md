## Description
The present invention relates to a fixed rod carding machine, for carding fibers in general, provided with self cleaning rod members. As it is known, the revolving flat carding machines are usually formed by a plurality of supporting elements, arranged in an adjoining relationship, which are continuously driven or displaced about the main cylinder which is caused to rotate about its axis. The mentioned supporting elements are of elongated shape in the axial direction of the cylinder and consist of a plurality of carding elements or flats, which are arranged in an adjoining relationship according to a perpendicular direction to the longitudinal extension of the supporting elements. In the known arrangement, at the ends of the individual carding elements, an unactive region is formed, that is a region devoid of any teeth processing the fibers during the carding operation. Thus, in the mentioned region, fibers are inevitably curled, since the fibers cannot be easily taken by the teeth and a undesired build up of material occurs, which remarkably reduces the processing operating efficiency. Another drawback of the known carding rod carding machines is that the carding reeds or blades are provided, at the bottom near their operating edge, with a substantially rectilinear extension tangentially arranged with respect to the surface of the mentioned main cylinder. Accordingly, at the end portions of the carding elements there is, with respect to the main cylinder, a distance greater than that which is defined between the carding elements and the cylinder, at the intermediate portion thereof. Thus an uneven processing will be obtained, since the carding action the fibers are subjected to is a greatly variable and uneven one, along the extension of the individual carding elements. Moreover, the shape of the carding elements presently used in known carding machines, while affording an efficient engaging of the fibers and teeth, is such as to cause, under each carding element a great build up of material, susceptible to obstruct or clog the carding elements, thereby reducing the carding efficiency. The GB A 666 185 reference discloses a carding machine having substantially the features of the preamble of claim 1, while the DE C 52 874 reference discloses the replacement of flexible flat cloth by metal clothing for carding purposes. Thus, the aim of the present invention is to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks by providing a fixed carding rod carding machine provided with a carding element active working region extending through the overall periphery of the main cylinder without any discontinuities at the transition region between a carding element and the next carding element. Within that aim, it is a main object of the present invention to provide such a carding rod carding machine in which the individual carding elements are shaped in such a way as to provide an even effect all along their longitudinal extension, thereby facilitating the engaging and even stretching of the fibers. Another object of the present invention is to provide a fixed carding rod carding machine which does not cause any curling or build up of the fibers, thereby providing an even arrangement of fibers about the main cylinder. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide such a carding rod carding machine in which there is obtained an evenly progressive processing over the complete processing or operating region thereat the carding elements operate, thereby improving the structure of the layer of the fibers being processed. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide such a carding rod carding machine which is very reliable in operation. According to one aspect of the present invention, the above aim and objects, as well as yet other objects which will become more apparent hereinafter are achieved by a fixed carding rod carding machine for carding fibers in general having the features of the characterizing part of Claim 1. In particular there is provided that the mentioned carding elements be formed with a tooth arrangement, including pulling teeth with an end portion directed in an opposite direction to the fiber advancing direction, said pulling teeth being alternatively arranged with orienting teeth, having a symmetrical end portion with respect to the perpendicular direction to said advancing or feeding direction. Further characteristics and advantages of the carding rod carding machine according to the present invention, will become more apparent thereinafter by the following description of a preferred, though not exclusive, of the carding machine itself, being illustrated, by way of an indicative example, in the figures of the accompanying drawings, in which With reference to the mentioned figures of the accompanying drawings, the fixed rod carding machine according to the present invention, comprises a plurality of supporting elements, indicated overally at 1, which, advantageosuly are double T shaped. The mentioned supporting elements extend longitudinally and are located adjoining one another and extend in a continuous manner along a perpendicular direction to their extension direction, about a main cylinder 2 effective to be rotated about its axis, and parallely arranged to the extension direction of the individual supporting elements. Each supporting element 1 is provided, at its lower or bottom end portion, with an attaching lug 3, advantageously of dove tail shape, which may be engaged with the corresponding anchoring seat 4, also of dove tail shape, as formed on the carding element 5 which is applied to each supporting element. In actual practice, the thus constructed carding rods have such a shape which affords the possibility of easily inserting, in a perfectly engaged way, toothed carding element sets, with spacers of different size. In particular, since the mentioned carding element sets may be interexchanged by sectors, it will be possible to replace a possibly damaged sector in a very easy way, without the need of removing the remaining sectors. Moreover, the carding rods may also be adjusted longitudinally and laterally in addition, since the mentioned rods are fixed ones, they may be applied on the carding machine up to 360 , included the grill, which provides a carding grill. Owing to the possibility of working through the complete 360 of the machine, the carding rod shape, furthermore, provides for the formation of interspaces or gaps in order to clean the fibers and remove from pressure the carded material. It should moreover be pointed out that the mentioned carding rods have been so designed as to be adjusted in a very simple and precise way and that they may be produced starting from suitable moldable or extrudable materials. The mentioned carding element 5 consists of a plurality of carding elements or flats 6 which are arranged in an adjoining relationship and extend in a substantially perpendicular direction with respect to the axis of the main cylinder with a mainly circumpherential configuration. More specifically, the mentioned carding elements consist of a carding element provided, at the bottom, with a tooth formation, generally indicated at the reference number 7. The mentioned tooth formation is provided with pulling teeth, evenly alternated with orienting teeth 8a. In particular, the pulling teeth 8 have one end portion whereof, indicated at 9, the tip of which is turned in an opposite direction to the fiber advancing or feeding direction. That tip portion, at the front whereof, is provided with a slant portion 10 meeting with a beveled portion 11 extending in an opposite direction to the slanted portion and meeting with a recessed portion 12. On the extrados of the pulling tooth 8 there is formed an arc shaped portion 13 leading to a groove 14, followed by the tooth 8a which, at the rear, is arranged near to said pulling tooth. More specifically, the tooth 8a has such a profile which is substantially symmetrical with respect to the perpendicular direction to the fiber advancing or feeding direction, thereby all of the sides 15 thereof form, therebetween, an angle which, advantageously, may be of 60 . Moreover, the rear side 15 meets with the recessed portion 12. With the disclosed arrangement, the particular profile of the pulling teeth 8 affords the possibility of providing an efficient carding operation and an easy discharging of the fibers which will be located downstream of the pulling teeth. Thus, the carding rods will be held in a perfectly clean condition, without any material build up. In actual practice the fibers passing the mentioned pulling teeth will be engaged by the orienting teeth 8a, provided with symmetrical tip portions, which will provide an ordered orientation of the fibers, thereby efficiently cleaning the carding rods or elements and processing the fibers in a more even way. It should moreover be pointed out that the tooth formation 7 extends, preferably, along a curved profile, having a substantially equal radius as, or a possibly greater radius, than the radius of the main cylinder of the carding machine in such a way as to prevent any discontinuities in the distance between the carding elements and main cylinder from occurring, during the working or processing steps of the carding machine. The above mentioned carding elements, in particular, are intercalated with spacer elements 16 the thickness whereof may be varied, depending on the specific needs, in order to better fit the characteristics of the fibers being processed. The attaching lug 3 of the carding elements, furthermore, is located in such a way that said carding elements are supported in a slanted way, with respect to the tangential direction of the main cylinder. Thus, the fibers fed to the carding machine are subjected to a progressive type of mechanical action since, at the inlet portion or inlet end, the spacing between the carding element and the main cylinder is greater than the distance which is provided at the outlet end. Moreover, each carding element is arranged, with respect to the main cylinder 2 at a differentiated distance, in such a away that the carding elements arranged downstream of the carding machine are nearer to said main cylinder, with respect to the carding elements arranged upestream. In actual practice, a carding element having the disclosed structure and associated with a carding rod has the following characteristics since a carding element or flat is very thin, and has an even hardness, it has a high flexibility, thereby it will be held always right and parallel to the other carding elements. Furthermore, that same carding elements has very polished side walls and has a radius fitted to the curved surface of the drum, thereby obtaining a carding at a 100 rate. A further very important characteristic is that of providing two types of tooth that is one for the carding step and the other, a subsequent one, for the cleaning step the cleaning action is carried out since the shape of the cleaning tooth is such as to convey on the drum all of the fibers being carded. Thus, since the carding element is designed in such a way that the fibers, by sliding between the drum and the carding element are combed without any stoppings, it will favour a perfect parallelism of the fibers. This system will afford a universal type of carding, since the thickness of the carding element is held unchanged and only the thicknesses of the spacers between the carding elements are reduced. The subject carding element is stronger than any other covering card cloth presently commercially available infact, the known flats are made from soft tempered steels, whereas the subject carding element has a very great wear resistance since it has a constant hardness. Moreover the carding elements according to the present invention afford the possibility of increasing the production rate of the carding machine and, in some cases, they provide a double productivity this is, in particular, also due to their polished structure and to the different types of teeth which render them actually auto cleaning. While a preferred embodiment of the carding elements has been disclosed and illustrated by way of an indicative example, it should be noted that it is susceptible to many modifications and variations, all of which come within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the accompanying claims.
