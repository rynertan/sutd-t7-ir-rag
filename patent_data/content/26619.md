# Anaerobic digester for organic waste.

## Abstract
Organic wastes, such as animal manure, are fed into an elongated digester tank 14 at one end 16 thereof in slurry form. The slurry slowly moves to the other end 18 of the tank 14 for subsequent disposal. During the residence time in the tank 14 decomposition of the waste occurs yielding methane gas and carbon dioxide. A cover 12 over the digester collects the gas generated. A heat exchange arrangement 36 causes transverse stirring of the slurry as its passes through the tank 14 enhancing the decomposition process. Scum suppressors 40 on the surface of the slurry prevent interference with the formation and release of the methane gas. The settling of solids is controlled by the use of gas jets 60 disposed along the bottom of the tank 14 .
