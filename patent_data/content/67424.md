# FLAME RETARDANT POLYPHENYLENE ETHER RESIN COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
A polyphenylene ether resin composition comprising i from 30 to 90 weight percent of a graft copolymer free from polyphenylene ether homopolymers prepared by polymerizing 20 to 200 parts by weight of styrene type compound at a temperature in the range from 130 C to 200 C in the presence of 100 parts by weight of polyphenylene ether and 0.1 to 15 parts by weight of a radical initiator and ii 10 to 70 weight percent of a styrene type compound polymer having a number average molecular weight in the range from 50,000 to 200,000 is rendered fire retardant by the addition of an effective amount of a phosphine oxide having the formula HOCH₂CH₂
