# Hydrogen peroxide process.

## Abstract
An anthraquinone autoxidation process has been developed for producing hydrogen peroxide employing N substituted 2 pyrrolidones as solvents for the anthrahydro quinone formed in the reduction step. These new solvents have improved solubility characteristics over prior sol vents. Particular N substituents are alkyl and alkaryl groups containing 6 to 12 carbon atoms.
