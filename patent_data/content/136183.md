# Control store arrangement for enhanced CPU pipeline performance.

## Abstract
An entry control store in a central processing unit CPU is addressed by the next macroinstruction to be executed by the CPU and fetches the microcode for the first line of that macro instruction. The apparatus includes an entry point table 42 and a control store 58 wherein, in macroinstruction access a pointer in the entry point table is used to obtain microcode from the control store 58 and place it on a bus 62 connected to output lines of the control store 58 . An auxiliary control store 48 , containing the first line of microcode for each macroinstruction, is accessed by the microinstructions and has output lines which are selectably connected to the bus 62 by bus selection means 84 for selectively disconnecting the output lines of the control store 58 from the bus 62 when the output lines of auxiliary control store 48 are selectably connected to the bus 62 . The selection means 84 are ar ranged to respond to microcode indicia 80 indicating whether the control store 58 or the auxiliary control store 48 are to be connected to the bus 62 .
