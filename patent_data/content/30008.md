## Abstract
Spiral type first and second coils 1₁ to 1₈, 3₁ to 3₈ of the same shape and size are arranged on both surfaces of an insulating sheet 31 to be opposite to each other, the insulat ing sheet is made by piling and bonding two insulating films to each other using bonding agent, the inner ends of the first and second coils which are opposite to each other are con nected to each other by connecting sections 2₁ to 2₈ 4₁ to 4₈ via the insulating sheet, and the outer ends are so connected that all coils are connected in series, and terminals 41, 43 are provided on both ends of the series connection.
