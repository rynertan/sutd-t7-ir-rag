# Nickel gold nickel conductors for solid state devices.

## Abstract
A laminated conductor includes a lower thin film 10 of nickel deposited upon a substrate 9 containing, e.g., silicon. Upon the film of nickel, a thicker film 11 of gold is deposited as the conductive portion of the conductor. On the upper surface of the gold layer is deposited a thin film 12 of nickel.
