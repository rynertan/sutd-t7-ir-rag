# Information display apparatus for ophthalmic slit lamps.

## Abstract
A slit lamp with surgical laser capability includes an x y table. An optical micrometer, readily retrofittable onto existing slit lamps, is mounted on the x y table to measure table dis placement in the y direction. The measuring electronics are resettable to allow the operator to select any y position from which the displacement is to be algebraically measured. Com pact display optics are retrofittably mounted on the ocular as sembly of the slit lamp between the collimator and the eye piece to insert a reduced image of an LED indicator displaying the measured data into the periphery of the ophthalmic image seen through the eyepiece. An LCD indicator displaying the same data is mounted on the x y table to allow positioning of the table without looking into the eyepiece. The LED indicator lends itself to display of laser operational data in addition to po sitional data.
