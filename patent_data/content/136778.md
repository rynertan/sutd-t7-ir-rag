## Description
POSITION SENSING APPARATUSIt is known to sense the position of an object by providing a sensor supported on a support and moving the support relative to the object to bring the sensor into sensing relationship with the object, the sensor having an output responsive to attainment of the sensing relationship. The output has to be transmitted to a control system via the support.In cases where it is required to provide for automatic attachment of the sensor to the support and removal of the sensor therefrom it is desirable to provide for the wireless transmission of the sensor output. It has already been proposed to transmit said output optically between a transmitter on the sensor and a receiver on the support but this requires a relatively precise position of the receiver relative to the transmitter. According to the invention there is provided a position sensing apparatus comprising a sensor releasably connected to a support , the support being movable relative to an object to be sensed, the sensor comprising an ultrasonic transmitter adapted to generate a sensor signal responsive to the sensor coming into sensing relationship with the object, the transmitter being in sound transmitting engagement with the support,and a receiver connected in soundtransmitting engagement with the support in a position remote from the transmitter for reception of said signal.The use of ultrasound makes it possible to transmit the signal through the support and to site the receiver on the support in a relatively arbitrarily selected location thereon so that the position problem of optical transmission can be overcome.An example of apparatus according to this invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawing wherein Fig. 1 is a sectional elevation of a part of a machine tool.Fig. 2 is a block diagram of a transmitter receiver system.Fig. 3 is a diagram of signals processed by the system.Referring to Fig. 1, there is shown one end of a machine tool spindle 10 which normally supports a cutting tool, e.g. a milling cutter, but into which has been inserted, in the place of the tool, a sensor 12 whereby to sense a surface 14 of a workpiece 16 when the spindle is moved to bring the sensor into sensing relationship with the surface 14. The purpose of the arrangement is to measure the position of the surface 14. In this example the sensor 12 comprises a stylus 20 supported on electrical contacts 22 arranged in a housing 18 from which the stylus extends.The sensor is said to be in sensing relationship with the surface 14 when the stylus engages the latter surface and by such engagement becomes displaced from at least one of the contacts 22 to the extent of breaking an electric circuit 24 and commence generation of a signal sequence generally referred to as the sensor signaLReferring now also to Fig. 2, the circuit 24 includes a power supply being a battery 26 arranged so that when a said contact 22 is broken a Schmitt trigger circuit 28 outputs a primary signal, being a monostable signal 28A, to an encoder 30 adapted to produce a secondary or code signal 30A to a tranducer drive unit 32 adapted to drive an ultrasonic transducer 34 which produces a corresponding transmission signal 34A of ultrasound.The elements of the circuit 24 constitute a transmitter 35. The transducer 34 is earthed into sound transmitting relationship with the housing 18. Preferably, as shown, the transducer 34 is earthed to one end of a conical steel spigot 36 to which the housing 18 is secured and which forms part of the sensor. The spigot 36 is drawn into firm but releasable engagement with a conical socket 38 provided in the adjacent end of the spindle 10, the engagement being effected by a draw mechanism 40 in a manner known for releasably connecting a cutting tool to the spindle. Both the spigot and the spindle are made of steel and the firm engagement between them ensures transmission of at least a significant part of the energy of the signal 34A from the sensor 12 to the spindle 10. The spindle is supported for rotation in a bearing housing 42 by means of a rolling element bearing 44.The signal 34A passes across the bearing 44 and through the housing 42 to a receiver 45 comprising a transducer 46, amplifier and filter unit 48, decoder 50 and display or output device 52.Referring to Fig. 3, the secondary or code signal 30A is intended to ensure discrimination between the sensor signal 12A and any echos or other noise from the spindle 10 or any other part of the machine. Essentially the code comprises a transmitted pulse T1 responsive to the rising edge of the signal 28A and at least one transmitted confirmation pulse T2 occurring at a given point of time in the duration of the signal 28A. The decoder 50 is designed to respond to the transmitted start pulse T1 by generating a received start pulse R1 and, responsive to the latter pulse, a confirmation pulse window W1 whose position relative to the pulse R1 corresponds to the position of the pulse T2 relative to the pulse T1.If the transmission is true then there occurs a received confirmation pulse R2 coincident with the window W1. The decoder is designed to respond to this coincidence by outputting a monostable signal 50A1 to the display unit 52. If the transmission is false , i.e. if the decoder does nct receive a confirmation pulseR2, or some interference pulse occurs in the interval between the received start pulse R1 and the window W1, then the decoder outputs an error signal 50AO to the display unit.The transmitter 35 also includes a clock 33 adapted to output a clock signal 33A to the drive unit 32 for transmission to the receiver 45. The signal 33A is a regular pulse signal intended to indicate to the display that the stylus 20 is seated on the contacts 22 and that the transmitter receiver link is operational. The encoder 30 is arranged to stop the clock for a period slightly in excess of the code signal 30A whereafter the clock resumes its operation. Responsive to receipt of any said clock signal, the decoder generates a window W2 intended to be coincident with the next clock signal. Responsive to the absence of a said clock signal at any given window W2, the decoder outputs an error signal the same as the signal 50AO. The battery 26 may be provided with a battery condition sensor not shown and known per se having an output identifying a given level of charge of the battery.The latter output is connected to the encoder to include in the signal 33A a discrete pulse identifying said level for transmission to the display unit.
