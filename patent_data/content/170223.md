# Magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
The rotary head type helical scanning magnetic tape recording and reproducing apparatus is provided with an auxiliary recording head 5a,6a,5b,6b for recording pilot signals adjacent to a main head 3a,4a,3b,4b for recording a signal to be recorded, and an auxiliary reproducing head 1a,2a,1b,2b for reproducing the recording pilot signals. The pilot signals recorded to an antecedent track are reproduced by the auxiliary reproducing head 1a,2a,1b,2b at the time of recording to the next track. A tracking control of the main 3a,4a,3b,4b head at the time of next track recording is effected according to the reproduced pilot signals.
