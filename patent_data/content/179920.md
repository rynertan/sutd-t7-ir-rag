# APPARATUS FOR RECORDING DATA SIGNALS.

## Abstract
An apparatus for recording data signals that can also be used as an audio only apparatus. When used as an audio only apparatus, sampling is effected at a frequency m times greater than a sampling frequency of voice signals used at the time of recording image signals, and the sam pled PCM digital voice signals are recorded onto at least two recording sections to improve the quality of voice sig nals, yet maintaining interchangeability with an audio only apparatus which employs a video unit of the same type.
