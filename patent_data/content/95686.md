# FLUID PRESSURE ENERGY TRANSLATING DEVICE

## Abstract
A fluid pressure energy translating device comprising a housing, a rotating group rotatably mounted for rotation within the housing. The housing includes a valving face 16a engaged by the rotating group. The housing has por tions 22 spaced from the valving face 16a which are undercut to define grooves 20 so that portions of said valving face can move axially with respect to the rotary group to compensate for mechanical, fluid dynamic and thermal effects imposed by the fluid displacement and pressure.
