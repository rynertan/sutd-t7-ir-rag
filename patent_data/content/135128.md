# STEPPER MOTOR DAMPING CIRCUIT AND A METHOD THEREFOR

## Abstract
A control circuit for a stepper motor is disclosed. The stepper motor is driven by a chopper drive circuit. The frequency and the duty cycle of the stator or motor winding to which the chopper drive circuit has supplied the current is measured. The frequency and duty cycle measured are related to the back EMF induced in the driven stator. The back EMF is filtered and is used in a negative feedback manner and is supplied to the quadrature phase of the stepper motor to provide a damped step response.
