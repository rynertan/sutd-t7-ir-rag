## Abstract
The invention relates to a polishing head particularly for polishing slabs of granite, marble, and the like, which comprises a body 1 connected to a bracket 2 supported for translation on a stationary frame 4 , said body 1 having at the bottom a disk 20 arranged to rotate axially relatively to said body 1 and carrying a plurality of abrasive pads 30 set oscillating about substantially perpendicular axes to the axis of said disk 20 . A peculiar aspect of the invention is that said body 1 is mounted on said bracket 2 with provision for oscillating about a substantially perpendicular axis to the axis of said body 1 . Also provided is an elastic balancing means 10 acting between said body 1 and said stationary frame 4 , as well as a dampening means 12 acting between said body 1 and said bracket 2 .
