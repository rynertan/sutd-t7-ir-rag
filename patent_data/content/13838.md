# Can clip.

## Abstract
A clip for joining together and thus forming a package of a plurality of cans having a chime on their upper edge employs a body supporting a chime engaging hook 34 at its lower end and a spaces pair of chime engaging tabs 44 at its upper end, all of which cooperate to engage one can chime. The body is flexibly hinged 46 between portions 30 dedicated to engage each can so that the hook and tabs engaging one can are not deformed by pivotal motion of other cans in the clip. For great est material efficiency each hook 34 engages the chime over an arc segment, and the the tabs 44 engage the chime over a non overlapping arc segment at each end of the segment en gaged by the hook. The tabs extend downwardly against the inside chime surface to abutment with the can end. A cover sheet may be used in association with the clip, and may have a peripheral skirt protecting the can sides.
