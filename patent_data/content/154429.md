## Description
The present invention relates to tomographic or sectional radiographic equipment being adapted to inspect and or analyze defects in a given object, particularly relating to X ray or γ ray tomographic testing apparatus for nondestructive testing of size, dimensions and or inner defects in industrial products. Tomographic equipment called as a computerized tomography scanner CT scanner may be utilized to safely and accurately inspect the inner defects, tissues, construction, etc. of materials. Such a CT scanner is provided with a radiation source and radiation detector. The radiation source generates a fan beam X ray which is spreaded along a two dimensional sector plane. The radiation detector is opposed to the radiation source with a slice of an object to be inspected therebetween. The detector is formed with a plurality of radiation sensors which are arranged around the radial directions of the spreaded X ray sector plane. When the source detector configuration is rotated 360 degrees around the object in a steps of one degree, a large amount of data representing X ray absorption of the object slice for respective angles of 360 degrees is obtained. A tomographic image corresponding to the obtained X ray absorption data is reconstructed by means of computer processing. The reconstructed tomographic image of respective portions in the inspected object slice may have a thousand gradations, and therefore, a precise inspection or analysis of the object material can be achieved. In recent years, it has been proposed that a CT scanner be applied to nondestructive testing of size, dimensions and or inner defects of industrial products. Such a CT scanner may have a configuration as shown in Fig. 1. A similar configuration is disclosed in Fig. 1 of U.S. Patent No. 4,293,912 issued on October 6, 1981 . According to the configuration of Fig. 1, a main body 1 of the scanner has an X ray source 2. Source 2 radiates a fan beam X ray FB for each projection within a given spreading range. A radiation detector 3 is opposed to X ray source 2. Detector 3 includes a large number of tiny radiation sensors which are arranged around the radial directions of the spreaded X ray sector plane. Each of the radiation sensors senses, with a certain spatial resolution, the intensity of X ray from source 2. The radiation path defined between source 2 and each of the radiation sensors is called as an X ray path. Each of the radiation sensors delivers an individual signal which indicates the intensity of an X ray on the corresponding X ray path. Scanner main body 1 is provided with a rotation actuator not shown . X ray source 2 containing an X ray tube is mounted on the rotation actuator so that the rotation center of the actuator coincides with the center of a tomography region. The actuator serves to effect a single way rotary scanning of the X ray. The rotary scanning angle is sequentially changed by prescribed degrees. An object material 4 to be inspected is placed within the tomography region. An X ray radiation control, a current and voltage control for the X ray tube, etc. are performed by an X ray controller 5. A rotation control for the rotation actuator is achieved by a scanner controller 6. The operation of controllers 5 and 6 is governed by a system controller 7. System controller 7 also governs the whole operation of the CT scanner. Various instructions and or data required by the system controller 7 are obtained from a console 8. An operator of the scanner may input specific data or instructions to controller 7 through a manipulation of console 8. Respective outputs E3 analog from the radiation sensors of detector 3 are supplied to a data collector 9. Collector 9 includes an A D converter. According to a control command I7 from system controller 7, the A D converter converts the analog outputs E3 into digital X ray absorption data D9 for each projection. Absorption data D9 is supplied to a preprocessor 10. Under the control of system controller 7, data D9 is variously processed through a log converter, gain corrector, off set corrector and so on contained in preprocessor 10. Processed data D10 from preprocessor 10 is convoluted by a convolver 11 upon receipt of command I7 from system controller 7. Convoluted data D11 from convolver 11 is supplied to a back projector 12. In back projector 12, data D11 is back projected along the projection direction, and reconstruction of a tomographic image of the back projected data is achieved. Reconstructed image data D12 of the back projection is stored in an image memory RAM 13. Data D13 read out from memory 13 is supplied to an image converter 14. In converter 14, data of a desired range of CT values contained in data D13 or data being defined in accordance with the degree of X ray absorption is image converted, so that data D14 representing the desired CT range is displayed with various white levels in a monochrome display screen or a CRT display 15. The CT scanner of Fig. 1 will operate as follows. First, in order to obtain a tomographic image of object 4, an operator of the scanner manipulates the key board of console 8 so that the CT scanner starts to operate. Then, system controller 7 instructs the scanner controller 6 to perform the step rotation of the rotation actuator with a given angle. System controller 7 also instructs the X ray controller 5 to perform an intermittent application of a given voltage and current to the X ray tube for each of the step rotations. The period of intermittent voltage and current applications to the X ray tube for each step rotation is prefixed. By the intermittent application of voltage and current to the X ray tube, X ray source 2 sequentially generates pulsate fan beam X rays FB. Object 4 is located at the rotation center tomography region of the rotation actuator, and X ray source 2 faces the detector 3 through the rotation center. Accordingly, as the rotation actuator rotates, a specific slice of object 4 is subjected to the radiation of fan beam X rays FB from various directions. Then, X ray transmittances of respective X ray paths for each fan beam X ray FB are sensed by the radiation sensors of detector 3, and information of the sensed transmittances is converted to outputs E3. The data regarding the converted outputs E3 is collected by data collector 9. For each of tomographic projections, data collector 9 supplies the collected data D9 to preprocessor 10, so that the collected data D9 is log converted, gain corrected, off set corrected, etc. Preprocessed data D10 from preprocessor 10, which indicates X ray absorption of respective X ray paths for each projection, is convoluted in convolver 11. Convoluted data D11 from convolver 11 is supplied to back projector 12 in which a back projecting operation is effected. Then, CT values for the locations or respective pixels of an image are obtained, and a tomographic image corresponding to the obtained CT values is reconstructed. The reconstructed tomographic image is stored in memory 13. In accordance with specific instructions from console 8, the gradation of the CT values regarding a desired region of the stored tomographic image is determined by image converter 14, and the tomographic image with the determined gradation is displayed at CRT display 15. Thus, the reconstructed tomographic image is displayed on the monochrome display screen with given various white levels. Generally speaking, according to the CT scanner as shown in Fig. 1, about 300 to 600 sets of projection data are needed for an accurate inspection or analysis of industrial products. Namely, tomographic measuring is performed 300 to 600 times for each single rotation of the rotation actuator in scanner main body 1. From this, a long scanning time 5 to 10 seconds or more is required for each inspection. Even where the CT scanner of Fig. 1 is used for a relatively simple inspection of industrial products e.g., a test for merely judging whether or not the inspected product is good , at least a hundred sets of projection data will be required. Accordingly, if such a CT scanner is used for inspecting the inner defects of products to be mass produced, a smooth, fast flow of mass produced products in the factory is unobtainable because of the length of time needed for inspection. This is one of the problems to be solved. The system described in U.S. patent no. 4 415 980 is typical of such systems which require a large number of sets of projections. In this system the reference data is subtracted from the inspection data to obtain any non common images, i.e. the flaws in the inspection sample. Further, in a medical X ray CT scanner, a reference material is often used for a comparable measurement. In such a comparable measurement, in a preceding step, projection data for a water fantom reference sample is obtained for various projection directions. An error due to the characteristic of the CT scanner is detected from the projection data of the water fantom, and values for compensating the error are calculated. Next, in a measuring step, each of inspection materials is set at the tomography region in place of the water fantom, and the obtained projection data for each inspection material is compensated in accordance with the calculated error compensating values. Then, the compensated projection data is convoluted and back projected to obtain a reconstructed tomographic image of the inspection material inspection sample . Although the above reconstructed tomographic image actually indicates the sectional view of the inspection sample, it is not evident directly from this tomographic image which portion of the inspection sample deviates from the corresponding portion of the reference sample, or it is not evident directly from this tomographic image whether or not the inspected sample is a good one. This is another problem to be solved. It is accordingly a main object of the present invention to provide a tomographic testing apparatus having an enhanced testing speed. An auxiliary object of the invention is to provide a tomographic testing apparatus in which how a tested inspection sample deviates from a reference sample can be gauged from a tomographic image of the inspection sample. To achieve the main object, a tomographic testing apparatus of the invention as defined in the claims employs two data collection modes. One of these modes is a reference data collection mode in which a large number of prescribed image data e.g., X1, X2, X4, X5, X7, X8 and X10 of a reference sample is obtained. The reference sample has no defect. The other of these modes is a measurement mode in which a predetermined small number of image data e.g., Y3, Y6 and Y9 of an inspection sample is obtained. The inspection sample may have defective portions. The tomographic image of the inspection sample is obtained from the combination X1, X2, Y3, X4, X5, Y6, X7, X8, Y9 and X10 of the inspection sample image data Y3, Y6 and Y9 and the reference sample image data X1, X2, X4, X5, X7, X8 and X10 from which specific data X3, X6 and X9 corresponding to the inspection sample image data Y3, Y6 and Y9 is deleted. According to the above tomographic testing apparatus, the number of data Y3, Y6 and Y9 to be actually measured is far less than all data Y1 to Y10 of the inspection sample. From this, the testing speed of the apparatus is effectively enhanced. To achieve the auxiliary object, the tomographic testing apparatus of the invention detects reference projection data for a reference sample and inspection projection data for an inspection sample. The difference between the reference projection data and the inspection projection data is reconstructed to obtain a tomographic image of the inspection sample. According to the above testing apparatus, when the tomographic image of the difference is characterized by color or by any other suitable means, how the tested inspection sample deviates from the reference sample can be seen from the tomographic image. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, the same elements are denoted by the same reference numerals throughout the drawings, thereby avoiding redundant explanations. Fig. 2A is a block diagram showing an X ray tomographic testing apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 2A, elements 1 to 15 may have the same configurations as the corresponding elements in Fig. 1. The key point of this embodiment is that a means 22 for storing information of a reference sample is provided between data collector 9 and image converter 14. In the Fig. 2A embodiment, a switch circuit 21 and reference image memory 22 used as the above storing means are located after the back projector 12. The switching operation of circuit 21 as well as the write read operation of memories 13 and 22 are controlled by system controller 7. The tomographic testing apparatus shown in Fig. 2A employs two operation modes. They are a reference data collection mode and a measurement mode. Which of these modes is selected is determined by an operator s manipulation for console 8. How, assume that 600 projections are assigned to obtain the tomographic image data for one rotation 360 degrees around the object. In this case, the pair of X ray source 2 and radiation detector 3 source detector configuration is rotated around object 4 with 0.6 degree step, and reconstructed image data D12 of the object 4 can be obtained from back projector 12 for each of the 600 projections. In the reference data collection mode, switch circuit 21 provides data D21Y corresponding to data D12 in accordance with a command 17 from system controller 7. In this case, all reconstructed image data of a non defective reference sample for one rotation i.e., the reconstructed image data of 1st to 600th projections are stored in reference image memory 22. Or, a prescribed major portion of reconstructed image data e.g., the reconstructed image data of 2nd to 200th projections, 202nd to 400th projections and 402nd to 600th projections is stored in reference image memory 22. In this case, the back projecting operations for 1st, 201st and 401st projections may be deleted. The prescribed major portion of reconstructed image data stored in memory 22 2nd to 200th projections, 202nd to 400th projections and 402nd to 600th projections can be optionally read out. The address of memory 22 for the prescribed major portion of reference sample image data is defined by command I7. In the measurement mode, in accordance with command 17, switch circuit 21 provides data D21X corresponding to reconstructed image data D12. In this case, a prescribed minor portion of reconstructed image data of a defective inspection sample e.g., the reconstructed image data of 1st projection, 201st projection and 401st projection is stored in image memory 13. The address of the prescribed minor portion of inspection sample image data is defined by command I7. When three projections 1st, 201st, 401st are used in the measurement mode, the angular deviation among these projections is preferably 120 degrees. If four projections 1st, 151st, 301st, 451st are used in the measurement mode, the angular deviation among these projections is preferably 90 degrees. Tomographic image data DT of the inspection sample In the measurement mode, when inspection sample 4 contains an inner defect As seen from the illustration in Fig. 3, plural artifacts a1 to a3 cross at the position of defect Incidentally, if the tomographic image of inspection sample 4 is obtained from all of the projections 600 projections without use of the tomographic image data of the reference sample, the artifacts indicating the location of the defect cannot be obtained in the displayed image. From this, a small number of projections is suitable for the test of inspection sample 4. According to the configuration of Fig. 2A, since the size, dimensions, internal configurations, etc. of industrial products to be mass produced are nominally prefixed, only a small number e.g., three of the projections is sufficient to complete the test for respective inspection samples. This is one of the important features obtained from the embodiment of the present invention. Further, according to the configuration of Fig. 2A, the geometrical location and or the size of defect The Fig. 2A embodiment may be modified such that a plurality of reference image memories 22 are used for storing plural different tomographic image slices of a reference sample. For instance, if 16 slices along the Z axis of a tomographic image on the X Y plane should be inspected, 16 reference image memories 22 1 to 22 16 are used. These memories 22 1 to 22 16 store 16 different image slices, respectively. According to such a modified embodiment, any desired tomographic image selected from 16 slices of an inspection sample can be optionally and quickly obtained by a key manipulation of console 8. Further, three sets of the CT scanners of Fig. 2A may be employed in a manner that the first CT scanner is used for the 1st projection rotation angle for 0 degrees , the second CT scanner is used for the 201st projection 120 degrees and the third CT scanner is used for the 401st projection 240 degrees , for example. These first to third CT scanners are arranged in series so that an inspection sample continuously and sequentially passes through these CT scanners. In this case, in a measurement mode for test or inspection, there is no need to rotate the source detector configuration 2, 3 in Fig. 2A , thereby saving time consumption required for the measurement of numerous inspection samples. In addition, radiation source 2 may utilize a radio isotope. Fig. 4 is a flow chart showing a typical operational sequence of the CT scanner according to the present invention. First, the mode of operation is designated by an operator of the CT scanner ST 10 . When an object material is a reference sample, the mode is designated as a reference data collection mode. When the object is an inspection sample to be tested, the mode is designated as a measurement mode. Next, the angles of specific projections for measuring or testing the inspection sample e.g., 1st, 201st and 401st projections selected from 600 projections are designated by the scanner operator ST 12 . If the reference data collection mode is designated YES at ST 14 , the projection angles designated at step ST12 are omitted from measurement, and measurement for the reference sample with respect to the non omitted projection angles is performed ST16 . If the measurement mode is designated NO at ST14 , measurement for the inspection sample with respect to the designated projection angles 1st, 201st and 401st projections is performed ST18 . The projection data obtained at step ST18 is combined with or added to the projection data obtained at step ST16, so that projection data for a complete tomographic image is obtained ST20 . Then, the combined or added projection data is reconstructed ST22 . Fig. 5 is a flow chart showing a part of the control sequence effected by system controller 7 in Fig. 2A. The mode of operation is designated by an operator of the CT scanner ST 30 . When a reference data collection mode is designated YES at ST 32 , controller 7 instructs the switch circuit 21 to select the contact Y ST 34 . When a measurement mode is designated NO at ST 32 , controller 7 instructs the switch circuit 21 to select the contact X ST 36 . After the contact selection of switch circuit 21, projection data is inputted to the configuration of elements 9 to 12 ST38 , so that measurement collection of projection data, preprocessing, reconstruction, etc. is effected. Assume here that 600 projections are assigned to obtain a complete tomographic image of the object and that projection data in the reference data collection mode are obtained from 2nd 200th, 202nd 400th and 402nd 600th projections. Then, if switch circuit 21 selects the contact Y, reconstructed projection data of the reference sample is stored at the 2nd 200th, 202nd 400th and 402nd 600th addresses of memory 22, for example. When switch circuit 21 selects the contact X and projection data in the measurement mode are obtained from 1st, 201st and 401st projections, reconstructed projection data of the inspection sample are stored at the 1st, 201st and 401st addresses of memory 13, for example. Thereafter, the projection data D21Y stored at the 2nd 200th, 202nd 400th and 402nd 600th addresses of memory 22 and the projection data D21X stored at the 1st, 201st and 401st addresses of memory 13 are read out according to command I7 from system controller 7, and these data D21Y, D21X from memories 22 and 13 are added together in adder 220. In this addition, memories 13, 22 and adder 220 are controlled by system controller 7 such that respective pixels of the reference sample correspond to those of the inspection sample. The added data D21Y D21X thus obtained becomes a complete tomographic image data DT. Or, according to a modification of the Fig. 2A apparatus as shown in Fig. 2B, the projection data D21Y of the reference sample stored at the 2nd 200th, 202nd 400th and 402nd 600th addresses of memory 22 are transferred via switch circuit 21 to memory 13. The transferred data are once stored at the 2nd 200th, 202nd 400th and 402nd 600th addresses of memory 13 in which the projection data D21X of the inspection sample are stored at 1st, 201st and 401st addresses. Then, the projection data D21X D21Y or D13 stored at the 1st 600th addresses are read out from memory 13 according to command I7. This read out data D13 corresponds to the complete tomographic image data DT. Fig. 6 is a general flow chart showing a basic operation of the CT scanner of the present invention. After the CT scanner operator starts the scanning ST40 , and if the mode is a reference data collection mode YES at ST42 , processing of the reference data collection is performed ST44 . If the mode is a measurement mode NO at ST42 , the measurement is carried out ST46 . Fig. 7 shows a subroutine of the reference data collection step ST44 in Fig. 6. In Fig. 7, after the start of operation of the scanner controller 6 ST50 , system controller 7 detects the rotation angle of the source detector configuration 2 3 in Fig. 2A ST52 . If the detected angle is not an angle for the measurement, e.g., if the detected angle does not correspond to any of given 1st to 600th projections NO at ST54 , the flow returns to step ST52, and the next rotation angle of the source detector configuration is detected ST52 . When the detected angle corresponds to one of the given 1st to 600th projections YES at ST54 , whether or not the detected angle corresponds to one of the reference data collection mode is checked. If the detected angle does not correspond to one of the reference data collection mode NO at ST56 , e.g., if the detected angle does not correspond to any of the 2nd 200th, 202nd 400th and 402nd 600th projections, the flow returns to step ST52, and the next rotation angle of the source detector configuration is detected ST52 . When the detected angle corresponds to one of the reference data collection mode YES at ST56 , e.g., when the detected angle corresponds to any of 2nd 200th, 202nd 400th and 402nd 600th projections, an X ray with a given intensity is temporarily radiated ST58 . Then, digital data representing outputs E3 from the radiation detectors is fetched by system controller 7 ST60 . After the data fetch is finished, the preprocessing, convolution and back projection for the fetched data are effected by elements 10 to 12 in Fig. 2A ST62 ST66 . Then, reconstructed image data is obtained. This obtained data is stored in memory 22 ST68 . If all the reconstructed image data for all of the projection angles angles for 2nd 200th, 202nd 400th and 402nd 600th projections in the reference data collection mode is not obtained NO at ST70 , the flow returns to step ST52. When all the reconstructed image data for all of the projection angles in the reference data collection mode is obtained YES at ST70 , an END message is displayed at CRT 15 in Fig.2 ST72 and the subroutine of Fig. 7 is finished. Fig. 8 shows a subroutine of the measurement step ST46 in Fig. 6. In Fig. 8, after the start of operation of scanner controller 6 ST80 , system controller 7 detects the rotation angle of the source detector configuration 2 3 in Fig. 2A ST82 . If the detected angle is not an angle for the measurement, e.g., if the detected angle does not correspond to any of the given 1st to 600th projections NO at ST84 , the flow returns to step ST82, and the next rotation angle of the source detector configuration is detected ST82 . When the detected angle corresponds to one of the given 1st to 600th projections YES at ST84 , whether or not the detected angle corresponds to one of the projections for the measurement mode is checked. If the detected angle does not correspond to one of the projections for the measurement mode NO at ST86 , e.g., if the detected angle does not correspond to 1st, 201st or 401st projection, the flow returns to step ST82, and the next rotation angle of the source detector configuration is detected ST82 . When the detected angle corresponds to one of the projections for the measurement mode YES at ST86 , e.g., when the detected angle corresponds to 1st, 201st or 401st projection, an X ray with a given intensity is temporarily radiated ST88 . Then, digital data representing outputs E3 from the radiation detectors is fetched by system controller 7 ST90 . After the data fetch is finished, the preprocessing, convolution and back projection for the fetched data are effected by elements 10 to 12 in Fig. 2A ST92 ST96 . Then, reconstructed image data is obtained. This obtained data is stored in memory 13 ST98 . If all the reconstructed image data for all of the projection angles angles for 1st, 201st and 401st projections in the measurement mode is not obtained NO at ST100 , the flow returns to step ST82. When all the reconstructed image data for all of the projection angles in the measurement mode is obtained YES at ST100 , the selected contact Y of switch circuit 21 is changed to the contact X ST102 . Then, the contents of memory 22 reference sample data is added to the contents of memory 13 inspection sample data to obtain a complete tomographic image data ST104 . The obtained tomographic image data is displayed at CRT 15 ST106 and the subroutine of Fig. 8 is finished.

The reference numeral 22X denotes an X ray source which corresponds to element 2 in Fig. 2A for generating a fan beam X ray having a given spreading width. The reference numeral 23X denotes a radiation detector which corresponds to element 3 in Fig. 2A being opposite X ray source 22X. Radiation detector 23X is formed with a large number of tiny radiation sensors. The radiation sensors are arranged around the spreaded fan beam X ray and serve to detect, with a certain spatial resolution, the intensity of X rays from X ray source 22X. X ray source 22X and radiation detector 23X are mounted on a rotary actuator 24X in a manner that a tomography region 21aX is located at the center between source 22X and detector 23X. Rotary actuator 24X serves to effect a one way step rotation of the sorce detector configuration 22X 23X with a given angle. The reference numeral 31X denotes an object material sample to be tested placed in tomography region 21aX. The reference numeral 30X denotes a support member.

The reference numeral 29X denotes a console which corresponds to element 8 in Fig. 2A . Console 29X is provided for inputting various instructions, data, etc. Console 29X is manipulated by a system operator when instructions and or data, etc. are inputted to the testing apparatus. The reference numeral 32X denotes a data collector which corresponds to element 9 in Fig. 2A . Collector 32X receives respective outputs E23X from the radiation sensors in detector 23X. Data collector 32X delivers X ray absorption data D32X corresponding to A D converted radiation sensor outputs E23X. The reference numeral 33X denotes a preprocessor which corresponds to element 10 in Fig. 2A . Preprocessor 33X receives X ray absorption data D32X for each of the projections collected by data collector 32X. Preprocessor 33X performs prescribed preprocessing such as a gain correction, off set correction, etc. and delivers preprocessed data D33X corresponding to the inputted X ray absorption data D32X. The reference numeral 34X denotes a data memory. Memory 34X stores preprocessed data D33X corresponding to X ray absorption data D32X of respective projections collected in a reference data collection mode. The reference numeral 35X denotes a switch. Switch 35X is provided between preprocessor 33X and memory 34X and is used for switching the data transmission of D33X. According to a mode designation by console 29X, switch 35X is controlled by a command I28X from system controller 28, such that the contact A of switch 35X is selected in a reference data collection mode while the contact B thereof is selected in a measurement mode. Memory 34X is coupled to the contact A of switch 35X so that it may receive and store the data D35XA D33X from preprocessor 33X. The reference numeral 36X denotes a subtracter. Subtracter 36X receives data D34X from memory 34X and data D35XB D33X from preprocessor 33X via the contact B of switch 35X. Subtracter 36X delivers data D36X representing a difference D34X D35XA between the data D34X and the data D35XB obtained in the measurement mode. Here, it should be noted that subtracter 36X is controlled by system controller 28X, such that the projection of one subtraction input data coincides with the projection of the other subtraction input data, and that the X ray path of one subtraction input data is identified with the X ray path of the other subtraction input data. The reference numeral 37X denotes a convolver which corresponds to element 11 in Fig. 2A . Convolver 37X convolutes the preprocessed difference data D36X from subtracter 36X and outputs convoluted data D37X. The reference numeral 38X denotes a back projector which corresponds to element 12 in Fig. 2A . Back projector 38X back projects the convoluted data D37X along the projection direction and generates reconstructed image data D38X. The reference numeral 39X denotes an image memory which corresponds to element 13 in Fig. 2A for storing the reconstructed image data D38X. The stored contents of memory 39X can be optionally read out as data D39X in accordance with command I28X from system controller 28X. The reference numeral 40X denotes an image converter which corresponds to element 14 in Fig. 2A . Converter 40X serves to convert a desired range of CT values of the data D39X data with respect to levels of the X ray absorption into video data D40X having desired gradations or given colors. The reference numeral 42X denotes a CRT display which corresponds to element 15 in Fig. 2A . CRT 42X displays the tomographic image of data D39X with given gradations and or given colors. In the above embodiment, although the subtraction D35XB D34X is performed after the preprocessing, the subtraction may be performed after the convolution or after the back projection. The operation of the testing apparatus in Fig. 9 is initiated by the manipulation of a system operator through console 29X. The Fig. 9 embodiment employs two different modes, i.e., a reference data collection mode and a measurement mode. Each of these modes can be designated through console 29X. In the reference data collection mode, data of a reference reconstructed image i.e., data of the reference sample is collected. At this time, a standard model having no inner defect and no size dimension errors is used for the reference sample, and a routine measuring operation for the reference sample is performed. Thus, reference sample object material 31X is mounted on support 30X so that sample 31X is fixed within tomography region 21aX, and an instruction designating the reference data collection mode is given from console 29X. Then, system controller 28X allows the switch 35X to select the contact A. When a scanning start instruction start instruction for tomograming is delivered from console 29X, system controller 28X causes the scanner controller 27X to perform a rotation drive control for a given step rotation of rotation actuator 24X. At this time, system controller 28X also causes the X ray controller 26X to supply, for each of the above step rotations, a given tube current and given tube voltage to X ray source 22X by a prescribed period. Then, pulsate fan beam X rays FB are sequentially radiated from source 22X. Since object material 31X is placed at the rotation center tomography region of actuator 24X and since detector 23X mounted on actuator 24X faces X ray source 22X mounted thereon through the rotation center, X ray source 22X is allowed to radiate the fan beam X rays FB from various directions toward a given slice of material 31X. The radiation transmittance values of respective X ray paths in the fan beam X rays FB are sensed by radiation sensors in radiation detector 23X, and the sensed values are converted into electrical signals E23X. The above converted signals E23X are collected by data collector 32X in which the collected signals are A D converted into data D32X. In preprocessor 33X, A D converted data D32X is subjected to a log conversion, gain correction, off set correction and so on for each one projection. Preprocessed data D33X from preprocessor 33X X ray absorption data of respective X ray paths for each projection is supplied via the contact A of switch 35X to memory 34X. Memory 34X stores the supplied data D35XA for each projection. The above is the operation in the reference data collection mode. When the measurement mode is designated through the manipulation of console 29X, object material inspection sample 31X to be tested is fixed at the given location of support 30X. Since a deviation between the set position of the reference sample and that of the inspection sample disturbs an accurate measurement, the testing apparatus is so arranged that a precise positioning of the object material is ensured. This may be achieved by providing a referencing plane used for the positioning. After the positioning of inspection sample 31X is completed, if an instruction designating the measurement mode is given from console 29X, system controller 28X causes the switch 35X to select the contact B. Under this condition, when a scanning start instruction is given, the measuring operation is performed, so that the prescribed projection data is collected, said preprocessing is effected, and the preprocessed projection data D35XB is supplied to subtracter 36X from the contact B of switch 35X. On the other hand, projection data D34X whose projection is identified with the projection of the above preprocessed projection data D35XB is read out from memory 34X. Then, the read out projection data D34X is supplied to subtracter 36X. In subtracter 36X, the projection data D34X D35XA obtained in the reference data collection mode is subtracted from the projection data D35XB obtained in the measurement mode. The subtracted data D36X from subtracter 36X is supplied to convolver 37X in which a convolution is effected. The convoluted data D37X is back projected in back projecter 38X, and the back projected data D38X is stored in memory 39X. Then, the reconstruction of a tomographic image is completed. An example of the reconstructed tomographic image is shown in Fig. 10. In Fig. 10, the solid line A indicates the outline of the reference sample, the broken line B indicates the outline of the inspection sample, the slant lined area C indicates a minus area of CT values, the dotted area D indicates a plus area of CT values, and another area E indicates zero CT values. Thus, in major pixel positions at which CT values are the same as the corresponding CT values of the reference sample, the subtraction of the inspection sample CT value from the reference sample CT value results in providing a zero CT value area E . When the inspection sample has an extra portion while the reference sample does not have the corresponding portion, such an extra portion provides a plus CT value area D . When the inspection sample has a lacking portion while the reference sample does not have the corresponding portion, such a lacking portion provides a minus CT value area C . From this, if the CT value minus portion C , the CT value zero portion E and the CT value plus portion D are colored by red , blue and yellow , respectively, and such a colored difference image of the reconstructed tomographic image is displayed at color CRT display 42X, the lacking and extra portions of the inspection sample are impressively known to the system operator. Of course, these lacking and extra portions may be discriminated from one another by assigning specific gradations. According to the abovementioned embodiment, since the different portions of the inspection sample with respect to the reference sample are clearly known from the displayed image, an accurate inspection of defect, size and or dimensions of the tested material is ensured. The above embodiment is suitable to inspect a predetermined slice of a sample being formed of a uniform material. Although the above description is given in a case wherein a sample of unifom material is measured, it is possible to display the difference between a reference sample and a non uniform material sample by means of various concentrations of the image density. Further, as shown in Fig. 11, the difference between a reference sample and an inspection sample may be exaggeratedly displayed. In the illustration of Fig. 11, the amount length of the difference is expanded. An exaggerated image can be obtained by modifying a non exaggerated image in such a manner that the length of the difference along the normal direction of the outline of the reference sample is elongated. Although such difference expansion deforms the image of the actual figure of an inspection sample, since the character of the difference is exaggerated, such an exaggerated display is impressive and suitable for a visual monitor. Fig. 12 shows details of a color converter 40X in Fig. 9. Fig. 13 is a graph explaining the operation of color converter 40X. Image converter 14 in Fig. 2A or 2B may have the Fig. 12 configuration, of course. In Fig. 12, data D39X from memory 39X is inputted to three digital comparators 402X, 404X and 406X. Each of comparators 402X and 404X receives first referece level data Dref1, and each of comparators 404X and 406X receives second referece level data Dref2. Reference level data Dref1 and Dref2 are obtained from a comparison level generator 410X. Comparator 402X generates a comparison result output D402X when D39X Dref1. This output D402X is supplied to a color generator 422X for generating yellow data D422X D39X Dref1 in Fig. 13 . Comparator 404X generates a comparison result output D404X when Dref1 D39X Dref2. This output D404X is supplied to a color generator 424X for generating blue data D424X Dref1 D39X Dref2 in Fig. 13 . Comparator 406X generates a comparison result output D406X when D39X Dref2. This output D406X is supplied to a color generator 426X for generating red data D426X D39X Dref2 in Fig. 13 . Data D422X, D424X and D426X are inputted to an OR gate 430X and the ORed output therefrom is supplied as the data D40X to color CRT display 42X. Fig. 14 shows a distribution of binary coded 1 data around the boundary line A in Fig. 11 of a reference sample. Figs. 15A to 15J illustrate how the pattern classification of binary coded 1 data around the boundary of an inspection sample is effected. In Figs. 14 and 15, the black and white tiny circles denote pixels of binary 1 data. Fig. 16 is a flow chart explaining how emphasizing or exaggerating the difference between a reference sample and a tested inspection sample is achieved. After the start of the operation of Fig. 9 apparatus, all binary coded 1 data at the boundary region of a reference sample black circles in Fig. 14 is extracted from the data in memory 34X ST110 in Fig. 16 . Then, each presently obtained binary coded 1 data of inspection sample 31X is classified to obtain binary coded 1 data at the boundary region of inspection sample 31X ST112 . After obtaining binary coded 1 data at the boundary region of inspection sample 31X and also obtaining binary coded 1 data at the corresponding boundary region of the reference sample, along each of the prescribed directions as exemplified by arrows in Figs. 15A to 15J, a length The above process for obtaining the elongated length data L is repeated until this processing is completely effected on all binary coded 1 data at the boundary region of inspection sample 31X. If the processing is not completed, the process for obtaining the data L is sequentially applied to the next unprocessed boundary data at the boundary region of inspection sample 31X NO at ST118 and ST120 . When the above processing is completed, the difference exaggerating operation is finished YES at ST118 . The data L thus obtained is used for displaying the exaggerated tomographic image. Fig. 17 shows a configuration of an X ray tomographic testing apparatus according to another embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment corresponds to the combination of Figs. 2A and 9. According to this embodiment, the tomographic image indicating defective portions only and containing artifacts of an inspection sample is obtained from a small number e.g., three of the data collection, thereby achieving a speedy test. The apparatus of Fig. 17 will operate as follows. In a first step, raw data D35XA of a reference sample for all projections e.g., 600 projections are collected, preprocessed and stored in memory 34X. In a second step, raw data D35XB of the reference sample for prescribed projections e.g., 2nd 200th, 202nd 400th and 402nd 600th projections are collected and preprocessed. Then, data D36X representing the difference between the first step preprocessed data D34X D35XA stored in memory 34X and the second step preprocessed data D35XB is produced from subtracter 36X for each of the mutually related projections, i.e., the difference between the first step data of an N projection and the second step data of the N projection is detected. N projection is one of the 2nd 200th, 202nd 400th and 402nd 600th projections . The detected difference data D36X is reconstructed for said mutually related projections 2nd 200th, 202nd 400th, 402nd 600th , and the reconstructed difference data D21Y is stored in reference image memory 22. In a third step, projection data of an inspection sample for the 1st, 201st and 401st projections are collected and preprocessed. Then, the difference D36X between the first step preprocessed data D34X stored in memory 34X and the third step preprocessed data D35XB is detected for each of the mutually related projections, i.e., the difference between the first step data of an M projection and the third step data of the M projection is detected. M projection is one of the 1st, 201st and 401st projections . The detected difference data D36X is reconstructed for each of the mutually related projections 1st, 201st, 401st , and the reconstructed difference data D21X is stored in image memory 13. In a fourth step, the difference data D21X stored in memory 13 1st, 201st and 401st projections is added by adder 220 to the difference data D21Y stored in memory 22 2nd 200th, 202nd 400th and 402nd 600th projections . Then, a reconstructed tomographic image data DT for 600 projections of the difference between the reference sample and the inspection sample is obtained from adder 220. The Fig. 17 embodiment has the advantages of both of the embodiments of Figs. 2A and 9. Fig. 18 shows another modification of Fig. 2A embodiment. According to the Fig. 18 emdodiment, in the reference data collection mode, back projected reference image data from back projector 12 is transferred via a signal port X of switch circuit 21 to reference image memory 22, and the transferred data is stored in memory 22. In the measurement mode, prior to perform the measuring of the inspection sample for each of the selected projections e.g., 1st, 201st and 401st projections in 600 projections , the back projected reference image data stored in memory 22 is set in back projector 12 via a signal port Y of switch circuit 21. Then, convoluted data D11 of an inspection sample from convolver 11 is back projected and superposed upon the back projected reference image data set in back projector 12, so that a reconstructed tomographic image data D12 DT is obtained and transferred to image converter 14. According to the configuration of Fig. 18, since the back projection for an inspection sample can be effected sequentially on the back projected reference image data which is set in the back projector for each projection, the measuring speed for the inspection sample can be effectively enhanced and, in addition, the circuit configuration of the testing apparatus becomes simple. Fig. 19 shows a practical application of the apparatus of Fig. 2A, 2B, 9, 17 or 18. In the embodiment of Fig. 19, three sets of source detector configurations 2A 3A, 2B 3B and 2C 3C are employed. The first set of source detector configuration 2A 3A is rotatable around its tomography region through which object materials 4A, 4B, 4C, etc. are passed. The first set is used for collecting the reference sample data as well as collecting the inspection sample data of the 1st projection in given 600 projections. The second and third sets 2B 3B and 2C 3C are fixed with respect to their tomography regions. The second set is used for collecting the inspection sample data of 101st projection, and the third set is used for collecting the inspection sample data of 201st projection. If the projection angle of the first set 2A 3A is defined as 0 degrees, the projection angle of the second set 2B 3B with respect to the first set is 60 degrees and the projection angle of the third set 2C 3C is 120 degrees, as shown in Fig. 19. According to the configuration of Fig. 19, in the measurement mode, the first set 2A 3A is fixed at 0 degrees. An inspection sample to be measured is transferred from the right hand side to the left hand side in the figure. When inspection sample 4C comes to the tomography region of the third set 2C 3C, only the third set performs the data collection for the 201st projection of a given slice of the sample. When the same sample 4B 4C comes to the tomography region of the second set 2B 3B, only the second set performs the data collection for the 101st projection of the same slice. When the same sample 4A 4B comes to the tomography region of the first set 2A 3A, only the first set performs the data collection for the 1st projection of the same slice. Then, the projection data of the inspection sample slice for the three projections is obtained. The operation timing for the data collection of the first to third source detector sets is governed by the system controller 7 or 28X . The Fig. 19 arrangement is suitable when the testing apparatus is applied to a continuous inspection of mass produced products on a belt conveyer. The present invention should not be limited to the embodiment as mentioned above and illustrated in the figures. It is possible to optionally modify the embodiment without departing from the scope of the invention. For instance, although an X ray is used in the above embodiment, another radiation such as a γ ray, neutron or other like radiations may be similarly used in place of an X ray. Futher, although so called third generation CT equipment which employs a rotationally scanned fan beam for obtaining a tomographic image is utilized in the explanation of the embodiment, the present invention may be applied to a first generation CT equipment in which a pencil beam is traversingly and rotatingly scanned to obtain a tomographic image, or applied to a second generation CT equipment in which a narrow width fan beam is traversingly and rotatingly scanned to obtain a tomographic image, or applied to a fourth generation CT equipment in which an object material to be inspected is surrounded by sensor elements and only a radiation source for radiating a fan beam is rotated at the time of scanning.
