# Helicopter transmission systems.

## Abstract
A helicopter transmission system is disclosed in which drive from three engines 11, 12, 13 is transmitted to two output channels 25 each of which is divided by dividing means 26, 27 to drive two output pinions 30 meshed with a common combining gear 31 rotationally fixed to a sustaining rotor drive shaft 15 . Balancing means 35 are provided to balance the torque transmitted by the respective pairs of output pinions and, in the described embodiment, the balancing means comprise a plurality of meshing spur gears 35a, 35b, 35c, 25d arranged with one of the spur gears 35a drivingly connected to one of the engines 13 and a further two of the spur gears 35b, 35c are drivingly connected respectively to the two output channels. Conve niently, a further one of the spur gears 35d provides a power take off to an anti torque rotor drive shaft 39 .
