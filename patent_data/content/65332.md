# Apparatus and method for the concentration of a liquid by evaporation.

## Abstract
Concentration of a liquid by evaporation is per formed in a heat exchanger having riser tubes 2 for the liquid and a granular mass fluidised by the liquid to occupy the tubes. At their upper and lower ends the tubes open into upper and lower chambers. A hot me dium contacts the tubes to transfer heat to the liquid. In order to render this heat exchanger effective for evaporation concentration, means 13, 14 are provided for vapour collection and discharge from the upper chamber, the riser tubes extend above the base 3 of the upper chamber. A return conduit 16 for recircu lation of the liquid and granular mass connects the upper chamber to the lower chamber, opening in each case at a lower level 22, 24 than the riser tubes. Sup ply and discharge connections 11, 18 for the liquid are at levels lower than the upper ends of the tubes.
