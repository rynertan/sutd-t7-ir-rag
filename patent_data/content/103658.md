## Description
TITLE A layered dry cell battery. INTRODUCTION This invention relates to a layered dry cell battery and more particularly to a battery having a plurality of dry cell units stacked one over another to form a series connection, each dry cell unit having a composite positive electrode formed into a tablet shape whose side or sides are enclosed with a water proof and acid resisting lining. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART Conventional layered dry cell batteries are generally composed of a plurality of dry cell units stacked one over another and packed in a casing. A typical example is shown in Fig 1, wherein is the complete layered battery, 10 is one of the dry cell units and 17 is a casing in which the dry cell units 10 are packed. A conventional dry cell unit 10, as shown in Fig 2, is composed of a rectangular, composite positive electrode 15 containing manangese dioxide, a paper casing 14 which covers the bottom surface and the side surfaces of the composite positive electrode 15 as also shown in Fig 3 , a paper sheet 13 to abut the bottom surface of paprer casing 14, a negative electrode 12 consisting of a zinc sheet to abut paper sheet 13, and a carbon film 11 to abut negative electrode 12 so that composite positive electrode 15, paper casing 14, paper sheet 13, negative electrode zinc sheet 12 and carbon film 11 constitute a laminate which is further enclosed with a heat shrinkable plastics shielding material or case 16 that leaves the central area of the top surface of composite positive electrode 15 and the central area of the lower surface of carbon film 11 exposed.When assembling composite positive electrode 15, paper casing 14 and paper sheet 13, a suitable quantity of electrolyte such as an aqueous acid solution in added so as to soak paper casing 14 and paper sheet 13 with the aqueous acid solution, and therefore a voltage is generated between composite electrode 15 and zinc sheet negative electrode 17. When a plurality of the cell units are stacked one over another, that is, connected in a series, a voltage is provided equivalent to the sum of the voltages generated by each individual cell unit. In such a conventional cell unit as described above paper casing 14, which covers the bottom surface and sides of composite positive electrode 15, tends to expand after being soaked with electrolyte. Therefore, a large space at the bottom and around the composite positive electrode is occupied by the paper casing. As a result, a large, portion of the space within the casing of a completed layered battery is not effectively util ized. OBJECT OF THE INVENTION It is a primary object of this invention to provide an improved battery of which the capacity, or the amperehour rating, is increased over conventional layered drycell batteries. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In view of aforesaid problem with conventional batteries, this invention provides an improved layered drycell battery having a plurality of dry cell units stacked o e on top of another to form a series connection said dry cell units each comprising a positive electrode which includes an electro lyte formed into a shape having a top surface, a bottom surface and at least one side a water proof and acid resistant lining enclos ing the side or sides of the positive electrode and leaving exposed central areas of the top and bottom surfaces of the. positive electrode a paper sheet abutting the bottom surface of the positive electrode a negative electrode in sheet form abutting the paper sheet a carbon film having an upper surface abutting the negative electrode and a lower surface and a plastics case retaining the positive electrode the lining, the paper sheet, the negative elec trode and the carbon film as a laminate with the central area of the top surface of the posi tive electrode and the central area of the lower surface of the carbon film exposed.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention provides a layered dry cell battery having a plurality of dry cell units 20 as shown in Figs LI and 6. The dry cell units 20 are to be stacked one over another and packed in a casing in a similar manner to a conventional layered battery shown in Fig 1. As shown in Fig 4, the dry cell unit 20 according to this invention comprises a composite positive electrode 25 which is composed of a mixture of manganese dioxide, ammoniumchloride, acetylene black, graphite powder and an electrolyte containing an aqueous acid solution as a binder, the mixture being compressed and formed into a tablet shape lining 24, which is made of water proof and acid resisting material such as heatshrinkable plastics, adapted to enclose the side or sides of tablet shaped composite positive electrode 25 so as to leave the central area of the top and bottom surfaces exposed a paper sheet 23 soaked with an aqueous acid solution to abut the exposed bottom surface of tablet shaped composite positive electrode 25 a negative electrode 22 consisting of a zinc sheet to abut paper sheet 23 a carbon film 21 to abut negative electrode 22 so as to form a laminated construction, the laminate being provided with a heat shrinkable plastics shielding material or case 26 around the side or sides thereof as shown in Fig 4. Lining 24 is so disposed as to surround the side or sides of the tablet shaped composite positive electrode 25 and then heated to shrink, as shown in Fig 5, so as to enclose all the sides and corners of the tablet shaped composite positive electrode 25 leaving the central area of its top and bottom surfaces exposed. Heat shrinkable plastics shielding material or case 26 is disposed in the same manner around the laminate of tablet shaped composite positive electrode 25 having lining 24 surround ing its sides, paper sheet 23, negative electrode 22 and carbon film 21, as shown in Fig 4, leaving the central area of the top surface of the composite positive electrode and the lower surface of the carbon film exposed. The central part of the top surface of tabletshaped composite positive electrode 15 is slightly elevated, as shown in Fig 4. The elevated top surface assures a good contact engagement with the upper surface of composite positive electrode 25 of one cell unit and the lower surface of carbon film 21 of another cell unit when they are stacked one over the other and packed in casing 27 as shown in Fig 6.. Because lining 24 is made of water proof and acidresistant material such as heat shrinkable plastics, which will not expand after contact with electrolyte containing an aqueous acid solution, no extra space in casing 27 will be occupied by lining 24. As a result, the space within casing 27 can be effectively utilized or allocated, to enlarge the size or volume of composite positive electrode on which size the capacity, or the ampere hour rating, of a complete layered battery depends.
