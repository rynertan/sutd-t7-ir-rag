# Driveline for regenerative braking.

## Abstract
A diesel engine 1 drives a continuously variable ratio transmission 3 via an over running clutch 2 and the transmission in turn drives a drive axle 4 . A flywheel 5 , used to store energy when the vehicle equipped with the driveline is braked, is energised via the transmission and also drives it when returning its stored energy to the vehicle. The connection between the flywheel 5 and the transmission 3 is via an over running clutch 6 and a centrifugal clutch 7 . The centrifugal clutch closes at a speed which is such that the speed of the gear 9 is a little above the maximum speed it could be driven by the engine 1 . When the flywheel 5 is not energised, the centrifugal clutch 7 is open and the engine 1 drives the transmission 3 via the clutch 2 and, after bringing the flywheel up to a speed corresponding to maximum engine speed, the flywheel is not driven so long as the engine speed is below maximum because of clutch 6 . When the flywheel 5 is energised during braking, the centrifugal clutch 7 is closed and the engine is decoupled from the transmission because of clutch 2 . The transmission is thus driven either by the flywheel or by the engine, and switching between the two takes place automatically.
