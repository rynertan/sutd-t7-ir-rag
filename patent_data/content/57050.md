# Process for the preparation of polymers of alpha olefins at high temperatures.

## Abstract
A solution process for the preparation of high molecular weight homopolymers of ethylene and copolymers of ethylene and C₃ C₁₂ α olefins is disclosed. The process involves feeding monomer, a particular coordination catalyst and hydrocarbon solvent to a reactor, polymerizing the monomer at a temperature of 105 320 C and recovering the polymer. The catalyst is obtained by either i combining solutions of titanium tetrahalide vanadium oxytrihalide and of organo aluminum compound at a temperature of less than 30 C, heating the resulting admixture to a temperature of 150 300 C for a period of 5 seconds to 60 minutes and combining the thus heat treated mixture with a solution of an organoaluminum compound or ii combining solutions of titanium tetrahalide and of organoaluminum compound at a temperature of less than 30 C, heating the resultant admixture to a temperature of 150 300 C for a period of 5 seconds to 60 minutes, combining the thus heat treated mixture with vanadium oxytrihalide and then combining the mixture so obtained with a solution of an organoaluminum compound. The catalyst thus obtained is fed to the process, without separation of any components of the catalyst. Each organoaluminum compound they may be the same or different is of the formula AlR
