## Abstract
The invention relates to an attachment means provided with a lock. The attachment means is of the type which is adapted to perform a rotary movement for attaching and releasing purposes. One end of the attachment means 4 is rotatably received in a knob 12 . The lock 17 is attached to the knob 12 in an eccentric position relative to the attachment means 4 . The lock 17 is adapted to take two different positions. In one position the lock releases the attachment means so that the attachment means is rotatable in relation to the knob 12 and in the other position the lock fixes the knob in relation to the attachment means by engaging a locking surface 10 on the attachment means.
