# Analog switch circuit.

## Abstract
An analog switch circuit which is provided with a transmission gate TG consisting of a first n channel MOS transistor N₁₁ and a first p channel MOS transistor P₁₁ , which transistors are connected in parallel, wherein the output terminal J₂ of said transmission gate TG is connected to a second n channel MOS transistor N₁₂ and a second p channel MOS transistor P₁₂ , which transistors are supplied with an output voltage Vout from the transmission gate TG , and wherein mirror capacitances C
