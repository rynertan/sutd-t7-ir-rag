## Description
ANTIGENS AND MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES REACTIVE AGAINST MEROZOITES OF Eimeria spp. s The invention herein described relates to obtaining of monoclonal antibodies which react specifically against merzoites and sporozoites of the parasite Eimeria tenella. Such antibodies are obtained by means of hybridoma technology. Hybridoma cultures producing antibodies against E. tenella are described. Merozoite antigens are identified and characterized. These antigens, along with certain monoclonal antibodies, are effective for the prevention and treatment of coccidiosis. The antigens of the invention are useful as vaccines against coccidiosis. By way of background, coccidiosis is a disease of animals caused by a variety of protozoan.parasites. Avian coccidiosis is a devastating disease of poultry caused by a variety of species of the genus Eirneria. This disease has a complicated life cycle consisting of both asexual and sexual stages. Chickens are initially infected with the disease after ingestion of free living oocysts which ZrX generally associated with fecal material. Oocysts develop into invasive asexual sporozoites in the chicken s digestive tract. The sporozoites infect epthelial cells and develop into multinucleate structures known as szkizonts. Each schizont matures and eventually liberates multiple invasive asexual structures known as merozoit.e . These merozoites leave the infected cell and reinvade other epithelial cells. The multiple invasive asexual stages involving sporozoites and merozoites account for much of the pathology of coccidiosis. The sexual cycle of coccidiosis is initiated when merozoites differentiate into gametocytes. Fertilization occurs and the fertilization products known as oocysts are released in the feces.Thus the parasite s life cycle is completed. In chickens, the life cycle of Eimeria tenella, a representative species, is completed in about seven to nine days. Due to the tremendous economic losses inflicted on the poultry industry by Eimeria species, a vaccine against the parasite is highly desirable. However, due to the complexity of the life cycle of the parasite and the variability of the quantity of antigens present in each stage, it has been observed that deactivated or killed parasites have not generated consistent immunity in the past. One solution to this problem is to isolate and characterize particular antigens from the parasite and administer them in a sufficient amount to serve as an immunizing agent. Preferably such antigens will offer protection against infection by all important species.It is known that various species of Eimeria, as well as different stages in the life cycle of the same species, have both common and specific antigens Cerna, Z, FoliaParasitologica Prague 17 135 140 1970 Davis et al.,Immunol. 34 879 888 1978 Rose, M. E., Immunol. 2 112122 1959 Rose et al,, Immunol. 5 79 92 1962 andTanielian et al., Acta Parasitol Yugosl. 7 79 84 1976 .It is also know that development of immunity to Eimeria is species specific and in some species of domestic fowl there is significant strain specific immunity Jeffers, T. K. In Long, P. L. et al. eds. , Avian Coccidiosis, pp. 57 125, Proc. 13th Poultry Sci. Symp. 1978 Joyner,L. P., Parasitol. 59 725 732 1969 Long, P. L.,Parasitol. 69 337 347 1974 and Long et al., Parasitol.79 451 457 1979 . Currently immunogens of Eimeria species capable of stimulating protective immunity in avian or mammalian hosts have not yet been isolated or identified. Such Eimeria immunogens will likely provide successful immunization against coccidiosis. The development of lymphocyte hybridoma technology provides a tool for producing relatively large amounts of specific antibodies against various antigens of Eimeria. By fusing specific antibody producing cells spleen cells with cells of a myeloma tumor, it is possible to produce hybridoma cells that secrete monoclonal antibodies directed specifically against the original sensitizing antigen Kohler Milstein, Nature London 256 495 497 1975 . If monoclonal antibodies against the parasite are obtained, it may be possible to provide such antibodies to infected or susceptible fowl and to thus provide the host organism with a measure of passive immunity.Once such hybridoma cultures producing monoclonal antibodies are obtained, it is possible by various procedures to utilize such antibodies to isolate and identify specific antigens which could in turn be utilized as a vaccine to provide host organisms with a system of active immunity. Various patents concerning hybridoma cultures and monoclonal antibodies are kno Wd i.e., U. S. Pat. Nos. 4,172,124 4,196,265 4,271,lc 4,361,549 4,631,550 4,364,932 4,364,933 4,364,934 4,364,935 4,364,936 4,381,292 and 4,381,295 . In light of the foregoing discussion of the economic effects of coccidiosis in the area of animal husbandry and more specifically in the poultry industry, control of the protozoan parasite is highly desirable.Accordingly, an object of this invention is to provide new and useful monoclonal antibodies obtained against merozoites of the parasite E. tenella. A further object is to isolate and identify specific antigens ofE. tenella useful as a vaccine for the control of avian coccidiosis. These objects are manifest in the following description and particularly delineated in the appended claims. Eimeria tenella, the species which infects the caeca of chickens, is a particularly devastating parasite that causes severe bloody lesions in infected animals.E. tenella has two merozoite stages in its life cycle which are respectively designated as first and second generation merozoites. Immunity to E. tenella is known to develop during the asexual merozoite stages of its life cycle Long, P. ed. , The Biology of the Coccidia,University Park Press, Baltimore, Md. 1982 3. A preparation of E. tenella merozotes is used to immunize mice in order to eventually generate monoclonal antibodies following the procedure described below. The monoclonal antibodies are used to identify antigens of the parasite. Monoclonal antibodies are further evaluatcd to assess their ability to neutralize the growth of the parasite in vivo. Antigens which elicit monoclonal antibodies which react with at least one species of Eimeria or with either merozoites or sporozoites, and show neutralization of parasite growth, are considered protective antigens. Protective antigens are regarded as potential candidates for the development of a vaccine against avian coccidiosis. The following non limiting Examples further serve to illustrate the invention. EXAMPLE 1 Quantitative Radioimmunoassay In order to evaluate the quality of antibodies, a quantitative radioimmunoassay was developed. Glutaraldehyde fixed sporozoites or merozoites usually 2 5x105 well arecentrifuged onto 96 well polyvinyl chloride or Removawelle plates Dynatech at 1400x g for 10 minutes in order to attach the organism to the bottom of the wells. Spotozoites or merozoites adhering to the bottom of the plate are reacted with serum samples, of mice immunized with the parasite or monoclonal antibody in culture supernatant of hybridomas. Incubation with the antibody was for 16 to 18 hours at 40C. or for two hours at room temperature.The bound antibody was, detected with a radioactively labelled second antibody 187.1, which is a rat monoclonal antibody specific to mouse k light chain. The anti mouse k light chain antibody is biosynthetically labelled with 35S methionine Yelton, D.E., et al., Hybridoma, 1 5 11 1982 . The radioactivity is monitored by liquid scinitillation counting. The radioimmunoassay method is subsequently applied to the surface membranes obtained from E. tenella sporozoites to ensure the reactivity of antibodies in immune mouse sera with membrane proteins. EXAMPLE 2 Construction of Hybridoma Cultures Primary cultures of chicken kidney cells are infected with freshly excysted sporozoites following procedures known to the art. Merozoites released into the medium five days after infection are harvested by centrifugation at 350x g for 10 minutes. Eightèen week old female BALB c mice are immunized intra peritoneally i.p. with lox107 intact or fragmented E. tenella merozoites in complete Freund s adjuvant. The animals are boosted with two i.p. injections of merozoites in medium 199 Gibco at two five week intervals after initial immunization. The serum obtained three days after each boost was checked for the presence of antibodies against E. tenella merozoites by indirect immunofluorescence assay IFA and radioimmunoassay RIA .Both of these assays are performed on glutaraldehyde fixed parasites. Hybridomas are derived following established methodology Kwan et al. 19q0 , Genetic Engineering ed.by J. K. Setlow A. Hollander, Plenum Publishing Corp.,New York, pp. 31 96 . Spleen cells from two mice immunized with E. tenella merozoites are fused with a non secreting clone of P3 myeloma,.P3 x63.Ag8.653 in the presence of 30 polyethylene glycol PEG 1000 from BakerChemical for eight minutes. Fused cells are distributed into 96 well tissue culture dishes Linbro and maintained in HAT selection medium Littleield, J. W., Science, 145 709 710 1964 . The HAT medium is prepared inDulbecco s modified Eagle s medium containing 20 fetal calf serum Gibco and 10 NCTC 104 MicrobiologicalAssociates . Hybrids are cultured in an incubator at 370C. and 10 CO2. Cultures are periodically assayed for the presence of antibody reactive with E. tenella merozoites by IFA and RIA methods. Positive cultures are shifted to 24 well tissue culture dishes in a medium devoid of hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine. Hybridomas are cloned in soft agarose over a rat embryo fibroblast feeder layer coffins et al., J. Cell Phyisol., 79 429 440 1972 . Positive hybridoma clones are designated by a subclone number i.e., a clone 15.84.4 is a subclone num 4 of a hybridoma designated as 15.84 . The class and subclass of immunoglobulin secreted by well characterized subclones are determined by an agar double diffusion method. Detergent NP 40 soluble extracts of hybridomas are used with rabbit anti mouse antibody reagents Meloy . EXAMPLE 3Characterization of Anti Merozoite Monoclonal Antibodies The characteristics of eight anti merozoite monoclonal antibodies are presented in Table I. The majority of the monoclonal antibodies reacted with merozoites as well as sporozoites by IFA as well as RIA.Monoclonal antibodies 1.90 and 4.76 did not react with sporozoites in IFA and on occasion in RIA see in TableI . Monoclonal antibody 15.84 did not react with merozoites in IFA but reacted equally.well with sporozoites as well as merozoites in RIA. The data summarized inTable I indicate that all the monoclonal antibodies derived from the anti merozoite fusion are cross reactive with sporozoites as well as merozoites of E. tenella.

Data from these experiments are presented in Table II. Six monoclonal antibodies which reacted in IFA with sporozoites derived from E. tenella are used to study the species cross reactivity.The results demonstrate that five monoclonal antibodies cross reacted with sporozoites derived from E. necatrix and E. maxims, and one monoclonal antibody 15.84 reacted with all five species of Eimeria tested.

Three monoclonal antibodies that react withE. tenella sporozoites are assessed by this assay. Freshly isolated sporozoites are incubated under sterile conditions with heat inactivated ascites fluid derived from three different hybridomas. The incubation period is for one hour at room temperature. The sporozoites are then introduced into the ceca of three week old chickens by surgical procedures. Parasite development is allowed to occur for five days after inoculation. At the end of this period, lesions are scored to evaluate the extent of the infection. The results of these experiments are expressed as percent protection offered by the monoclonal antibody and are presented in Table III. These data indicate that each antibody is at least partially protective under some conditions of this test system. TABLE III IN VIVO NEUTRALIZATION ASSAY WITH E.

Natl. Acad.Sci. USA 76 4350 4354 1979 . E. tenella sporozoites and merozoites are lysed and extracted with 1 Nonidet P 40 Bethesda ResearchLaboratory in 10 mM tris buffer pH 7.5 containing 155 mM NE4C1, 1.5 mM MgAc2 with protease inhibitors leupeptin and antipain at 30 ug ml, 4 mM phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride and aprotinin 2 trypsin inhibiting units ml .The lysis procedure involves an incubation for 30 minutes at 0 C. followed by a centrifugation at 2,500x g for 30 minutes. The pellet is discarded and the solubilized material is then used for gel electrophoresis. SDS poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis of samples reduced with 2 mercaptoethanol is performed in a discontinuous trisglycine system on 7 to 15 polyacrylamide gradient gels. The SDS PAGE separated proteins are transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter electrophoretically for 45 minutes. The nitrocellulose filter is then reacted with either the ascites fluid 1 to 100 dilution or spent culture fluid from hybridomas for 16 18 hours at 40C.Normal rabbit serum was included at a concentration of 10 in all incubations with antibody. The bound monoclonal antibody is detected by reaction with an.125I labelled rabbit anti mouse IgG antibody New EnglandNuclear . The reaction with the second antibody is usually for three to five hours at room temperature. The unbound second antibody is removed by washing. The nitrocellulose filters are then exposed with Kodak X ray filmXAR 5 or SB 5. Alternatively, the blots are developed by anELISA method using horseradish peroxidase coupled rabbit anti mouse IgG Miles and chloronaphthol Aldrich and H202 Baker as substrates. Molecular weights of the protein antigens are determined relative to molecular weight standards. The antigens recognized by monoclonal antibody 15.84 are illustrative. Monoclonal antibody 15.84 reacts with a doublet of an approximate molecular weight of 130 20 kd. However, the estimation of molecular weights of proteins of the order of 100 kd is subject to variation depending upon the molecular weight standards employed.In addition to the 130 20 kd species, 15.84 also reacts with a hand that has an apparent molecular weight of 300 50 kd. The larger molecular weight band constitutes about 15 to 20 of the antigen and perhaps is either an aggregate or a polymeric form of the 130 20 kd species.A control experiment with a monoclonal antibody that is known not to react with protein antigens is used to prove the specificity of the anti merozoite antibodies. In addition, other controls demonstrate that the monoclonal antibodies are parasite specific and do not react with the host specific protein. A summary of molecular wWght ata of antigens recognized by various antibodies is presented inTable IV. The significant feature is the presence of immunogenic antigens of either molecular weight 20 kd or 100 kd. range in E. tenella merozoites.
