# A merge element for bubble devices.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a gap tolerant merge element 10 for contiguous disk bubble devices. The merge element 10 includes one input track 18 with a tip portion 26 substantially facing the cusp portion of a second input track 22 to form a merge region. An output track 20 is associated with the merge region. In a preferred embodiment, the merge element is passive and does not have a conductor. In another embodiment, the merge element is active and does have a conductor.
