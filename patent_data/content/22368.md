# Method of removing contaminating impurities from leisure pools.

## Abstract
A method of removing contaminating impurities, particularly haloamines, from leisure pool water is disclosed and an apparatus therefor. Pool water containing haloamine contaminants is passed into an active carbon bed 2 of high surface area that has been treated with a reagent, for example hypohalous acid, that will convert a portion of it into a surface oxide so that the carbon either reacts with or catalyses the breakdown of the haloamines. The hypohalous acid is conveniently generated in the pool water prior to passage of it through the active carbon.
