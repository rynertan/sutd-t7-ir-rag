# Rechargeable non aqueous cell with a chalcogenide containing electrode, a method for preparing the chalcogenide compound and a method for the preparation of the cell.

## Abstract
A non aqueous secondary cell having a conventional alkali metal anode and a cathode which contains as the active material a chalcogenide having the nominal atom composition MxN1 xS₂ in which M is Mn, Fe, Ni, or Co, or mixtures thereof, N is V or Cr or mixtures thereof, and x is less than or equal to 0.5 when N is V and M is Fe, less than or equal to 0.33 when N is V and M is Ni, CO₂ or Mn, and less than 0.33 when N is Cr. Said chalcogenide is prepared by adding an oxidizing agent having an oxidizing potential of at least 2.8 Volts to a compound with formula LiyMxN1 xS₂, in which y is less than or equal to 1.
