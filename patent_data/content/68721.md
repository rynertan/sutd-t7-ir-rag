# Fabric washing process and detergent composition for use therein.

## Abstract
Fabric, particularly soiled fabrics containing calcium car bonate crystal growth poisons, may be washed in hard water to which has been added a detergent active material and an al kali metal carbonate if a secondary detergency builder is added after a defined critical state of the system is reached. The secondary builder may be a precipitating, sequestering or ion exchange builder, and is added in such an amount which would be insufficient, in the absence of the carbonate, to re duce the free calcium ion concentration to less than 10 ‚Åµ molar. The delayed addition can be achieved by separate dosing, coating the secondary builder, dosing the composition in the form of a two compartment sachet or forming the secondary builder material in situ. The composition may include a materi al, such as calcite, to promote the occurrence of the critical state.
