# Method of photolithographically treating a substrate.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of photolithographically treating a substrate, in which a surface of the substrate is treated at least at the area at which it consists of an inorganic material with an organosilicon compound. In order to improve the adhesion of a photolacquer layer to be applied, the organosilicon compound used is a 3 amin opropyl trialkoxysilane in the form of an aqueous solution.
