# Heat treating thermoplastic sheet materials for thermo forming.

## Abstract
An apparatus for, and a method of, heating a thermo plastic material in web form in readiness for forming three dimensional objects therefrom in a thermo forming process involves a advancing the web material intermittently through a heating zone on a belt conveyor without imposing thereon any mechanical stress inducing physical constraints such as may be applied by material gripping means , and b sweeping the web material with a series of hot air jets which are spaced apart in the direction movement of the material, which extend transversely across the width of the material, and which are reciprocated in that direction in a manner such as to ensure a uniform heating of the web material passing out of the heating zone to a thermo forming apparatus.
