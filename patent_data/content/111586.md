# Improvements of plain or rotating slides for vertical strips.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to improvements of plain or rotating sides for vertical strips and the small boxes from which such vertical strips are suspended. A series of boxes 1 crossed by a common transversal shaft, inside of which there are horizontal wormshafts 7 driven by said shaft. In their rotation, the wormshafts 7 actuate by rotation on vertical pinions 4 with five teeth 5 of twelve divisions on their outside, whose pinions incorporate in their axial gap another piece furnished at the bottom with a hook 15 for the vertical strip and at the top with a protuberance 3 , from this protuberance emerges a lower tooth 12 which is housed in a pinion recess 12 , and another partial upper protuberance which is cut into the gap of the upper cover 9 of the box and this cover is endowed with certain flexibility.
