# Apparatus for determining the positioning and measuring the depth, on which a construction or object is positioned in the ground.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an apparatus for determining the position and measuring the depth, on which a cable, con duit or other construction or object 18 is positioned in the ground. Generally use is made of a pricker. Such a cane, which is e.g. pointed, has to be brought into the ground with some force, which is difficult for the user and furthermore brings forth the danger of damaging the construciton or the object, the position in the groung of which has to be determined, by too large an exerted force. The invention, now, has for its purpose to engineer an apparatus of th mentioned type in such a way, that it is free from the disadvantages mentioned and thereto proposes to provide a measuring apparatus of the type mentioned in the preamble with a hollow, elongate probe 2 to be brought into the ground, a source 6 for medium under pressure, said source being connected to the end of said probe staying overground, and means 10,12 for measuring the distance, over which the foremost end of said probe is brought into the ground.

## Description
The invention relates to an apparatus for determining the position and measuring the depth, on which a cable, con duit or other construction or object is positioned in the ground. Generally use is made of a pricker. Such a cane, which is e.g. pointed, has to be brought into the ground with some force, which is difficult for the user and furthermore brings forth the danger of damaging the cosntruction or the object, the position in the ground of which has to be determiend, by too large an exerted force. Furthermore it is, after bringing the pricker into the ground, not always easy to remove it from the ground by pulling. The invention, now, has for its purpose to engineer an apparatus of the mentioned type in such a way, that it is free from the disadvantages mentioned and thereto proposes to provide a measuring apparatus of the type mentioned in the presamble with a hollow, elongate probe to be brought into the ground, a source for medium under pressure, said source being connected to the end of said probe staying overground, and means for measuring the distance, over which the foremost end of said probe is brought into the ground. In the case, of which as the medium water would be used, it can not be prevented that a muddy zone forms around the probe. Sometimes this may be undesirable. In connection therewith advantageously used may be made of air as pressure medium. In order to have the fluidisation of the ground mate rial to be removed to take place as effectively as possible while using as small as possible a quantity of medium prefe rably use is made of adjusting means for adjusting the medium flow. Verys simple is that embodiment, in which the measuring means are engineered in the form of a scale on the outer surface of said probe. Also use may be made of an alternative embodiment, in which the measuring means comprise a pressure sensor present at the end of the probe to be brought into the ground. The sensor measures the pressure of the medium at the out flow end of the probe. This pressure is, in connection with the ground condition, representative of the depth reached. In an embodiment, in which said probe exhibits an internal constriction at its end to be brought into the ground, an acceleration of the medium flow takes palce, which fosters the effectivity of loosening the ground mate rial. In a further embodiment, in which the probe exhibits an external enlargement at its end to be brought into the ground, it is obtained that the diameter of the drilled hole is larger than the diameter of the probe. In this way one is succeeded in that the ground material to be transported away is removed more easily, whilst furthermore the removing of the probe, if necessary after de energising of the source of medium under pressure, can take place very easily. Particularly the enlargement may be generally spheri cally shaped. For position determining and probing in clay advanta geously use may be made of an alternative embodiment, in whcih the enlargement is provided with a cutting edge at its peripheral edge directed to the foremost end. In this way it is ensured that sufficient space is maintained for further bringing into the ground of the probe, whilst sticking and jamming of the probe in the clay ground is not or hardly li kely to occur. The probe may be during operation by the user lightly be moved up and down and guided. The medium fed through, particularly the air, preforms the actual job. The up and down movement is particularly important in case of harder sand layers in case of somewhat softer sandlayers this up and down movement is not necessary. Furthermore the invention relates to a probe for application in connection with an apparatus of the type herein described before according to the invention. The probe may be engineered as a tube made of high quality steel, the inner diameter and the outer diameter of which can be chosen in dependence upon its length. The advantages of the apparatus according to the in vention can be summarized as follows. Only a very small force is necessary for bringing to the ground of the probe. In particualr for continuous opera tion this is of the utmost importance. As the muscle power to be applied is small, the danger of damaging the underground construction or the object is practically zero. In particular the apparatus according to the invention is, accordingly, well suited for localizing synthetic resin conduits, that are readily damaged with a usual pricker. The apparatus according to the invention provides the possibility of a quick measurement, or a large number of measurements with an assured time interval. The invention will now be explained with reference to the drawing of some arbitrarily chosen embodiments. In the drawing figure 1 shows in cross section a hollow elongate probe 2 brought partly into the ground 1, the upper end 3 of the probe 2 remaining overground being connected through a conduit 5 provided with a control valve 4, with a pressure air cylinder 6, which in an alternative embodiment may be replaced by a compressor. Probe 2 is provided, at its lower end 7, that has to be brought into the ground, with an internal constriction 8 and an external enlargement 9. Also the lower end is provided with a pressure senor 10, tht is, through a conduit 11, connected with a measu ring apparatus 12 that determines the relation between the pressure measured by sensor 10 and the depth, on which the sensor 10 is positioned. Arrows 13 indicate the undisturbed medium flow in pro be 2. Arrows 14 refer to the constricting medium flow at the constricting end, and at last arrows 15 indicate the way, in which the medium after leaving the probe and conveying ground material is drained of through the space 16 having the shape of a cylinder surface, the diameter of which ap proximatily corresponds to or is a little larger than the diameter of the enlargement 9. Around probe 2 the ground ma terial transported away will cumulate. The annular raised zone on the ground is referred to with reference 17. Probe 2 can be pushed into the ground with a very small force. As soon as the user feels that the lower end of probe 2 touches e.g. a conduit 18, he reads, on measuring apparatus 12, the depth, on which the end of the probe is positioned underground. Figure 2 shows a measuring probe 19 of a simpler type, the shape of which corresponds with probe 2 according to figure 1, which, however, is not provided with the pressure sensor 10 and conduit 11 for determining the depth, but the outer surface of which is provided with a scale 20, by means of which the user can read directly the depth, on which the lower end of probe 9 is positioned at the moment, on which it touched a construction or a object. Figure 3 shows a probe 21 provided with an enlarge ment 22 at its foremost end, which is provided with a cut ting edge 23 at its peripheral edge directed to said fore most end. In the probe 21 a ring 24 is present causing a con striction of the passage. This constriction is positioned a little rearwardly relative to the foremost end. This embodi ment is particularly intended for position determination and measuring in clay ground. Figure 4 shows a probe 25, which is particularly meant for sand and the like. This probed 25 is not provided with an external enlargement, but is exclusively provided with an internally positioned ring 26 in the vicinity of the fore most end, causing a constriction. The opening underground caused by the flowing through of the medium, is somewhat larger than the outer diameter of the probe 25, due to which no sticking of the outer surface of probe 25 in the ground can occur.
