## Description
Compatible Blends of Polydioxanone and Poly alkylene phenylene bis oxyacetate and Absorbable Surgical DevicesMade TherefromThe invention relates to compatible blends of polydiox anone and polyfalkylene phenylene bis oxyacetate and to absorbable surgical devices, especially sutures and ligatures, made therefrom. Despite the dissimilarity in molecular structure between the two polymers i.e., an all aliphatic polyester versus a polyester containing a substantial proportion of aromatic groups , the molten blends unexpectedly appear to be single phase compositions, by microscopic examination of the blend in the molten state.Background of the InventionSynthetic absorbable polymers have been used to produce various surgical products such as sutures, implants, prostheses, and the like, for several years. Illustrative D.S. Patents that disclose such polymers are Nos.3,297,033, 3,044,942, 3,371,069, 3,531,561, 3,636,956, RE 30,170, and 4,052,988. Implantable surgical devices must be sterile prior to implanting in the body. Sterilization of devices is usually accomplished by the use of heat, ethylene oxide, or gamma radiation using a 60Co source. In many cases, the use of gamma radiation is the most convenient and most certain way to effect sterilization. However, all of the synthetic absorbable polymers now in commercial use are degraded at least some extent by gamma radiation. Therefore, unless for some reason degradation of the polymer is desired for instance, to accelerate the absorption rate , the use of gamma radiation is ordinarily precluded for the purpose of sterilizing the presently commercial synthetic absorbable polymers.This invention provides compatible blends of polymers, the blend as a whole being absorbable, that can be sterilized by gamma radiation and still retain a useful level of physical and biological properties. When the blends are fabricated into surgical filaments such as sutures and ligatures, such filaments surprisingly have greater compliance as evidenced by reduced Young s modulus than filaments made from either of the two polymeric components alone. then incorporated into molded articles such as surgical staples, the blends impart a desirable level of toughness.Summary of the InventionThe single phase by microscopic examination of the melt blends of the invention contain polydioxanone and poly alkylene phenylene bis oxyacetate . In a preferred aspect, the blends of the invention are fabricated into drawn and oriented surgical filaments such as sutures and ligatures. In another aspect, the blends of the invention, alone or in combination with other polymeric materials, are employed in surgical staples, e.g., of the fastener receiver type.Relevant Prior Patent ApplicationIn Koelmel et al., U.S. Patent Application SerialNo. 587,332, filed Harch 7, 1984, for Poly p dioxanone Polymers Having Improved Radiation Resistance , and assigned to the same assignee as this application, there is disclosed copolyesters produced by reacting p dioxanone monomer with poly alkylene phenylene bis oxyacetate .

Preferred methods for producing these polymers are illustrated below in Examples 1 3.Example 1Preparation of Polyester of Ethylene Glycol and 1,4 Phenvlene bis oxvacetic acidTo a flame dried, mechanically stirred, 1 liter glass reactor, suitable for polycondensation reactions, is charged 127.1 grams of dimethyl 1,4 phenylene bisoxyacetate 0.5oles , 62.1 grams ethylene glycol 1.0 mole and 9.0 milligrams dibutyltin oxide 0.0071 weight percent based on the expected polymer weight . After purging the reactor and venting with nitrogen the reactor is immersed in a silicone oil bath and connected to a gas supply to maintain nitrogen at 1 atmosphere of pressure.The stirred mixture is heated to and maintained at 1600C., 1900C., and 2100C. for 2, 1, and 2 hours respectively during which time the methanol produced in the reaction, along with some ethylene glycol, is distilled from the reaction mixture and collected. The reactor is allowed to cool to room temperature. Some time later the reactor is evacuated and heated temperatures of 1900C., 2100C,, and 2200C. are maintained for 1, 1, and 2 hours respectively.The collection of distillate is continued during the low pressure less than about 100 microns stage of the polymerization. The temperature is increased from 2200C.to 2400C. over the course of 30 minutes and 2400C. is maintained for 3 hours. The reactor is removed from the oil bath and allowed to cool. The formed polymer is isolated, ground and dried. The polymer has an inherent viscosity of 1.31 dl g as determined in hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol 1HFIP at 250C. and a concentration of 0.1 g dl.Lower molecular weight polymers can be easily produced by decreasing the reaction time at 240 C. or by decreasing the final polymerization temperature. These techniques are well known to those skilled in the art of polycondensat ion reactions.The polymers may also be produced in a three stage polymerization where the diacid moiety, the diol and a catalyst are heated at atmospheric temperatures under nitrogen in a molten state, followed by reaction at reduced pressure in a molten state to produce relatively low molecular weight species of the polymer. The low molecular weight material is pelletized or ground and crystallized. The material is heated under vacuum in a third stage at a temperature below its melting point.This last solid state polymerization stage increases the molecular weight significantly.Example 2Preparation of Polyester of Ethylene Glycol and 1,4Phenylene bis oxyacetic acidTo a flame dried, mechanically stirred, 250 ml reactor, suitable for polycondensation, is charged 60.0 grams of dimethyl l,4 phenylene bis oxyacetate 0.236 mole , 31.6 grams ethylene glycol 0.509 mole and 11.7 milligrams of dibutyltin oxide 0.0197 weight percent based on expected polymer weight . After purging the reactor and venting with nitrogen, the reactor is immersed in a silicone oil bath and further connected to a gas supply to maintain nitrogen at one atmosphere of pressure. The stirred mixture is heated to and maintained at 1900 C. for 7 hours during which time the formed methanol, along with some ethylene glycol, is distilled from the reaction mixture and collected. The pressure in the reactor is reduced and a temperature of 190 C. maintained for an additional 3 hours under high vacuum. The stirred reaction mass is maintained under vacuum at 2000C. and 2200C. for 2 and 7 hours respectively while continuing to remove distillates.The polymer is subjected to 100 C. for 3 hours during which time the polymer crystallizes. The polymer is isolated, ground particle size less than 3 mm and dried.The polymer has an inherent viscosity of 0.76 dl g measured in HFIP at 250C. and a concentration of 0.1 g dl. Example 3Preparation of Poly p dioxanone Homopolymer TypicalLaboratory Scale Preparation Under a dry nitrogen atmosphere, p dioxanone 155.2 grams, 1.52 moles , l dodecanol 0.473 gram, 2.54 millimoles, 4.73 milliters of a 0.537 M toluene solution , and a catalytic amount of stannous octoate 0.115 milliliter of a 0.33 M toluene solution, 0.038 millimoles were added to a flame and vacuum dried 500 milliliter glass ampoule, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar. The contents of the ampoule were exposed to vacuum at room temperature for several hours with intermittant dry nitrogen purges.The glass ampoule was sealed under partial vacuum, placed in a silicone oil bath, and its contents were subjected to elevated temperatures with rapid magnetic mixing as melt viscosity allowed for one minute at about 120 C., three hours at 900C., and 96 hours at 800C. The resulting polyester was isolated by immersing the glass ampoule in liquid nitrogen and shattering the surrounding glass with a heavy object. The glass free polymer was ground in aWiley mill and stored under vacuum for 16 hours at room temperature. The ground polymer was heated at 80 cm. under a reduced pressure of 0.05 millimeter of mercury for 16 hours to remove any unreacted p dioxanone. The polyester had an inherent viscosity of 1.79 dl gm measured at 250C. and a concentration of 0.1 gram dl in hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol.The poly alkylene phenylene bis oxyacetate used in the invention can be represented by Formula I I C 0 CO CHR O Ph 0 CHR C0 Otn wherein G represents the residue after removal of the hydroxyl groups of a dihydric alcohol, wherein Ph represents phenylene or alkyl or alkoxy substituted phenylene, preferably 1,4 phenylene, wherein each R individually represents hydrogen or lower alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, or propyl, and wherein n represents a number whose average value reflects the degree of polymerization of the polyester. Is is produced by reacting a dihydric alcohol with a phenylene bis oxyacetic acid or, preferably, a lower alkyl diester thereof.The dihydric alcohols, which can be used singly or in mixtures, that can be employed to produce the polyesters include C2 to C8 alkylene glycols such as ethylene glycol, 1,2 and 1,3 propylene glycol, 1,4 butylene glycol, 1,6hexylene glycol, and the like polyalkylene glycols such as diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, poly oxytetramethylene glycol, and the like cycloaliphatic diols such as l,4 cyclohexanedimethanol, and the like and aromatic dihydric alcohols such as l,4 bis 2 hydroxyethoxy benzene, and the like. The polymethylene glycols having two to six carbon atoms are preferred. Ethylene glycol is most preferred.The dihydric alcohol and the diester or half ester or diacid are usually reacted in proportions of from about 1.1 to about 4 moles of dihydric alcohol per mole of diester or half ester or diacid .A catalytically effective amount of a transesterification catalyst, with or without an esterification catalyst, is used in the reaction. Uhile the reaction would proceed with a wide variety of such catalysts, as a practical matter because the blends of the invention are intended for use in absorbable products, biologically acceptable catalysts used in very small amounts are preferred.Specific examples of such catalysts are stannous octoate and dibutyltin oxide. Illustrative proportions are from about 750 to about 30,000, and preferably about 1500 to about 15,000 moles of phenylene bis oxyacetic acid or ester thereof per mole of catalyst.The polyesters usually have molecular weights in excess of about 2000, and inherent viscosities of at least about 0.2 dl gm, tested at a concentration of 0.1 gm dl in hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol at 250C.The polydioxanone used in the invention will normally have an inherent viscosity of greater than about 0.5, and preferably greater than about 1.5 dl gm, tested at a concentration of 0.1 gm dl in hexafluoroisophropyl alcohol at 250 C. The preferred polydioxanone for use in the invention is poly p dioxanone homopolymer. The blends of the invention are produced by mixing the two polymers in a suitable mixer such as a single or twinscrew extruder, or a Helicon helical twin blade mixer, at elevated temperature of, e.g., about 1400 to about 1600C. i.e., a temperature above the Tm of both polymeric components . The mixing is carried out for a relatively short period of time, sufficient to make a homogeneous blend e.g., 5 to 20 minutes of the two polymers that is a single phase composition, as determined by optical microscopic examination of the molten blend at about 140 CC. The blend usually comprises from about 5 to 30, and preferably from about 5 to 20, weight per cent poly alkylene phenylene bis oxyacetate , the remainder comprising polydioxanone.The blended polymers are then collected by conventional procedures, such as by pelletizing after the blending operation. One procedure for carrying out the blending is illustrated in the following Examples 4 7 Examples 4 7 and Control Example 1Dyed poly p dioxanone homopolymer PDO having an inherent viscosity in HFIP of about 1.8, and poly ethylene 1,4 phenylene bis oxyacetate PEPO having an inherent viscosity in HFIP of 0.62 were blended in a 3 4 inch single screw extruder, in the proportions by weight set forth in Table I, below. The die diameter was 0.125 inch. The four temperature zones T1 T4 listed in Table I refer to four successive temperature zones along the length of the extruder barrel. The extruder was a Brabender PrepCenter Universal Mixer Extruder equipped with a Model 2523 extruder barrel.The speed of the melt being extruded from the die was 2426 feet minute FPM . The extruded rod was quenched in water at the temperature indicated in the Table, and then taken up on a heated godet 1550F. , from which the rod was fed into a pelletizer.

EXTRDSfON The blends are melt extruded through a spinnerette in a conventional manner to form one or more filaments.Extrusion of the blends Examples 4 7, and Control 1 was accomplished using an INSTRON Capillary Rheometer. The blends were packed in a 9n C. preheated extrusion chamber and extruded through a 40 mil die L n 24.1 after a dwell time of 10 to 11 minutes at the extrusion temperature using a ram speed of 2 cm min. While extrusion temperatures depend both on the polymer Tm and on the melt viscosity of the material at a given temperature, extrusion of the blends at temperatures of about 400 to 750C.above the Tm is usually satisfactory. The extrusion temperatures of the blends described herein ranged from 155 to 1750C. The extrudate was taken up through an ice water quench bath at 4 feet minute. A screw type extruder or similar device can be substituted for the INSTRON Capillary Rheometer. The extrudate filaments are subsequently drawn about 5.75X to 6X in a multistage drawing process in order to achieve molecular orientation and improve tensile properties.The extrudates described herein were drawn 2 hours to about 1 week after extrusion. The length of time elapsed between extrusion and drawing may affect the drawing process the optimum time elapsed is easily determined by simple experimentation for each fiber composition. The manner of drawing is as follows The extrudate diameter range, 17.5 18.5 mils passed through rollers at an input speed of four feet per minute and into a heated draw bath of glycerine. The temperatures of the draw bath can vary from about 25 to 900C. the examples described herein employ a temperature of 520C. The draw ratio in this first stage of drawing can vary from 3X to about 7X the examples described herein employ draw ratios from 4X to 5X.The partially drawn fibers are then placed over a second set of rollers into a glycerine bath second stage kept at temperatures ranging from 500 to 950C. the examples described herein employ a second stage draw temperature of 75to. Draw ratios of up to 2X are applied in this second stage, but a ratio range of from l.2X to 1.5X has been employed in the examples.The fiber is passed through a water wash, taken up on a spool, and dried. A set of hot rollers can be substituted for a portion or all of the glycerine draw bath. The resulting oriented filaments have good straight and knot tensile strengths.Dimensional stability and tensile strength retention of the oriented filaments may he enhanced by subjecting the filaments to an annealing treatment. This optional treatment consists of heating the drawn filaments to a temperature of from about 4Ot to 900C., most preferably from about 600 to 800C. while restraining the filaments to prevent any substantial shrinkage. This process may begin with the filaments initially under tension or with up to 20 shrinkage allowed prior to restraint. The filaments are held at the annealing temperature for a few seconds to several days or longer depending on the temperature and processing conditions. In general, annealing at 600 to 800C. for up to about 24 hours is satisfactory for the blends of the invention.Annealing is preferably carried out under nitrogen or other inert atmosphere. Optimum annealing time and temperature for maximum fiber in vivo strength retention and dimensional stability is readily determined by simple experimentation for each fiber composition. The characteristic properties of the filaments of the invention are readily determined by conventional test procedures. The tensile properties i.e., straight and knot tensile strengths, Young s Modulus, and elongation displayed herein were determined with an INSTRON tensile tester. The settings used to determine the straight tensile, knot tensile, break elongation, and Young sModulus were the following, unless indicated Gauge Chart Crosshead Length Speed Speed cm cm min cm min Straight Tensile 12 20 10Knot Tensile 5 10 10Break Elongation 12 20 10Young s Modulus 12 20 10The straight tensile strength is calculated by dividing the force to break by the initial cross sectional area of the fiber. The elongation to break is read directly from the stress strain curve of the sample allotting 4 1 6E per centimeter of horizontal displacement.Young s Modulus is calculated from the slope of the stress strain curve of the sample in the linear elastic region as follows tanO x C L x CS x SLYoung s Modulus XH x XS e is the angle between the slope and the horizontal, XS is the initial cross sectional area of the fiber, SL is the scale load, XH is the crosshead speed, CS is the chart speed, and C L is the gage length. The SL may be selected to provide a 0 close to 450. The knot tensile strength of a fiber is determined in separate experiments. The test article is tied into a surgeon s knot with one turn of the filament around flexible tubing of 1 4 inch inside diameter and 1 16 inch wall thickness. The surgeon s knot is a square knot in which the free end is first passed twice, instead of once, through the loop, and the ends drawn taut so that a single knot is superimposed upon a compound knot. The first knot is started with the left end over the right end and sufficient tension is exerted to tie the knot securely. The specimen is placed in the INSTRON tensile tester with the knot approximately midway between the clamps. The knot tensile strength is calculated by dividing the force required to break by the initial cross sectional area of the fiber.The blends identified above as Examples 4 7, and ControlExample 1 i.e., 100 PnO were spun into filaments. The two Tables below, Ii and III, display the inherent viscosities of the blends, their melting points, certain extrusion and drawing conditions, and selected properties of the drawn and oriented filaments.

Thus 16, 24, or 32 segments of each fiber are implanted corresponding to two, three, or four implantation periods.The periods of in vivo residence are 7, 14, 21, or 28 days. The ratio of the mean value of 8 determinations of the breaking strength determined with an INSTRON Tensile tester employing the following settings a gage length of 1 inch, a chart speed of 1 inch minute, and a crosshead speed of 1 inch minute at each period to the mean value of 8 determinations obtained for the fiber prior to implantation constitutes its breaking strength retention for that period.The in vivo BSR of certain of the annealed and cobalt 60 sterilized monofilaments identified above are displayed below in Table VII TABLE VIIIN VIVO BSR Co60 STERILIZED PDO PEPBO MELT BLEND MONOFILAMENTS EMI27.1 Example SEP Weight SEP Blend SEP Sterilized SEP SEP Cryst.

Two rats per period are implanted for each of the examination periods.The animals utilized in these studies are handled and maintained in accordance with the requirements for theAnimal Laboratory welfare Act and its 1970 Amendment. The rats are killed at the appropriate periods by carbon dioxide asphyxiation, then their gluteal muscles are excised and fixed in buffered formalin. Utilizing standard histologic techniques, H and E stained slides of the muscles and implanted sutures are prepared for microscopic examination. Utilizing an ocular micrometer, the approximate suture cross sectional area is estimated in each site. The cross sectional area at five days is used as the reference value for estimating percent crosssectional area remaining at subsequent intervals. The absorption profiles of certain of the annealed and cobalt 60 sterilized monofilaments were determined.
