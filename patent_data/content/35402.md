# LIFT TRUCK APPARATUS FOR USE IN DEPOSITING A LOAD IN A PREDETERMINED POSITION

## Abstract
A lift truck 10 has a push frame 22 extensible at a predetermined speed by a hydraulic cylinder 64 in a hy draulic circuit containing a hydraulically controlled synchronising switch 78 and an adjustable hydraulic flow control valve 72 . The synchronising switch 78 operates automatically during extension of the push frame 22 to set a control circuit of the lift truck drive motor 32 such that the lift truck is caused simultaneously to be driven rear wards at a predetermined reverse speed equal to the speed of extension of the push frame 22 so as to deposit a load 20 in a predertermined position. A manually operable over ride switch 82 permits independent operation of the push frame drive and lift truck motor drive when necessary. Other automatic override switches 84, 136, 138 inhibit the effect of the synchronising switch 78 and prevent reverse lift truck movement in certain circumstances. The additional control apparatus can be fitted as an accessory to existing lift trucks.
