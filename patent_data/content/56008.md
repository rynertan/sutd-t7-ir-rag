# Apparatus for writing into variable length fields in memory words.

## Abstract
Apparatus for for writing into variable length fields in words stored in a computer memory has the memory words organised into bytes each of a specified number of bits. The word containing the starting address of the variable length field is accessed from memory together with the next succeeding memory word. The offset of the leading bit of the variable field is added to the field length by an adder 148 so as to determine the beginning and end of the variable field, and a decoder translator 230 determines the bytes in which the beginning and end of the field are located. Byte masking circuits 226 mask those bytes which are not to be re written, and allow writing into those bytes that are to be fully written. For the bytes which are to be partially written, starting and trailing bit decoder translators 200,206 determine which bits are to be masked in the partially written bytes and apply corresponding signals to byte masking latches 214, 224 . A carry signal from the address adder 148 indicates that the partial field crosses a word boundary and toggles a word selecting circuit 250 accordingly. Since the circuits are organised to operate on a pair of consecutive words they can handle partial fields from one bit up to a full memory word length even when this involves crossing the boundary between words.
