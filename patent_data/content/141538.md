# Static induction thyristor.

## Abstract
A static induction thyristor having a buried gate region 18 having a concentration distribution of the impurity which has at least one stepwise variation viewed from the surface of the gate for improving dv dt capability and for allowing more tolerance in the accuracy in the over etching and also for keeping variation of the gate resistance small. The thyristor has a high concentration layer and selec tive junction depth which is shallow for the location situated above or below the gate region, and may be provided with an insulating layer between the anode or cathode for further improving dv dt capability and the gate loss at turn on in high frequency operation and for improving manufacturing yield.
