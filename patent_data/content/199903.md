# A control apparatus for rectifying circuits.

## Abstract
A single phase, full wave diode bridge circuit 20 is connected with a chopper 30 on its DC output side. The output voltage of the chopper 30 is smoothed by a smoothing capacitor 40 and thereafter supplied to a load 50 . A current control apparatus 80 100 forms a current reference signal which is synchronized with an AC voltage applied to the bridge circuit 20 and has a magnitude corresponding to the current flowing through the load 50 and produces a deviation signal between the current refer ence signal and an actual AC input current of the bridge circuit 20 . The chopper 30 is controlled in accordance with the deviation signal so that the AC input current follows the current reference signal, whereby the power factor and the waveform of the AC input current is improved.
