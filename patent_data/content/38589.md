## Abstract
Device for determining the quantity of the contents of a tank 1 mounted in a frame 3,4 which rests on a base with four points of support disposed in the corner points of a rectangle, two adjacent points of support being constituted by force measuring elements 6 each consisting of a generally block shaped body 7 of metal, in which an opening 8 is cut out such that at the lower and upper side of the body two relatively thin elongated and substantially horizontally extending portions 9,10 are formed which are connected to each other at both ends by thicker material portions disposed at the vertical sides of the body, whereas at the lower side of the body a foot 11 is formed which protrudes from the one side towards the center of the body, and with which the body rests on the base, and the supporting frame 3, 4 of the tank is affixed on the upper side of the body near its other side and two strain gauges T1, T2 disposed in spaced apart relation behind each other in the direction to the center of the body are adheared to one of the thinner horizontal material portions so that by the deformation of said material portion as a result of the weight of the tank the one strain gauge is under strain of tension and the other under strain of longitudinal compres sion, the pairs of strain gauges of the two force measuring elements being connected in a resistor bridge to which a read out member is coupled so that a zero deflection and an end scale calibration of the read out member may be obtained.
