# Torque converter bypass.

## Abstract
A bypass drive line for a torque converter type automat ic transmission 11 in which the bypass drive line includes a viscous coupling 30 . The viscous coupling is of a sand wich construction including an annular body member 32 , an annular cover member 34 secured at its outer periph ery 34a to a side face of the outer peripheral portion 32a of the body member and spaced axially from the body member to define a viscous fluid chamber therebetween, and an annular clutch member 36 disposed in the chamber and having a central hub portion 40 adapted to be driv ingly connected to the output shaft 16 of the torque con verter 15 . The drive into the coupling from the housing of the torque converter is through an annular clutching surface 37 defined on the side face of the radially outer peripheral portion of the body member radially outwardly of the outer periphery of the cover member. The body member includes a central hub portion 32d which is journaled on the central hub portion of the clutch member and the radially innerpe riphery 34d of the cover member is sealed to the clutch member in non load bearing relation so that the entire ra dial and thrust loading of the body member and cover member are carried at the journal between the hub portion of the body member and the clutch member.
