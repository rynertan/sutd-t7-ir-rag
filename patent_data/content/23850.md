# Cryostat for photon detector and its use in a borehole logging tool.

## Abstract
A borehole logging tool having a semiconductor detector 22 includes a cryostat 24 to maintain the detector at cry ogenic temperatures. The cryostat has an elongate aluminium heat sink 46 on one end of which the detector is removably mounted. The other end of the heat sink is arranged to receive a liquid cryogen or the cold finger of a helium refrigerator, which is removed before a logging run, the detector being maintained at cryogenic temperatures during the logging run by absorption and retention of heat in the solid, single phase heat sink. An aluminium tube 42 having similar thermal capac ity and similarly pre cooled to cryogenic temperatures, sur rounds but is spaced from the heat sink, and carries it by means of low thermal conductivity supports. The tube is itself carried within an evacuated stainless steel housing 30 by sim ilar supports, which are arranged to permit substantial differ ential changes in length of the tube and the housing.
