# Assembly for the automatic cooling water connection to water cooled combination electrodes for electric arc furnaces.

## Abstract
An automatic facility for the connection of combination arc electrodes to a cooling water circuit, comprising a cooling water coupling device 17 mounted on the support ing arm 3 of the electrode, which on the one hand is connected to cooling water ducts 15, 15 and which on the other hand has openings 19, 19 , 19 into which the free ends 21, 21 of cooling water guides 7, 8 may be inserted, which are connected to the heat exchanger 1 of the combination electrode. By means of a fixing device 11, 11 mounted e.g. on the ring flange 9 of a contact device which is axially movable on the electrode, these ends of the cooling water guides may be positioned in such a way that, when slipping the electrode down through the clamping device 4 of the supporting arm 3 of the electrode, the free ends 21, 21 automatically assume an angle orientation which makes it possible to neatly insert these ends into the openings 19, 19 of the cooling water coupling device 17 .
