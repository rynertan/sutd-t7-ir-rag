# Suppressing of graft rejection in organ transplantation.

## Abstract
Suppression of the immunological rejection mechanism of a host which has received an organ transplant is achieved by the daily administration to the host of a ganglioside agent which effectively blocks the soluble immunological cell mediator interleukin 2 and or a blastogenic factor. By binding to the mediator for T cell blast formation, the mediator is prevented from binding to the asialo GM1 receptor on the surface of the T effector cell. Blastogenesis does not occur and the cell mediated rejection of the graft is prevented. Examples of suitable gangliosides are desialylated gang liosides such as asialo GM1, GD1a, GD1b or GT1.

## Description
Suppressing of Graft Rejection in Organ ransplantation This invention relates to tbe suppression of the cell mediated host versus graft rejection mechanism in transplantation of organs from a donor to a recipient host . More particularly, this invention relates to tbe use of chemical blocking agents which interfere with the ability of the host s cellular immune system to attack a foreign graft organ.It is well known that a graft from a genetically dissimilar member of the same species allogeneic graft can generate a population of killer T cells which are specifically cytotoxic for graft target cells bearing the major histocompatibility MHC antigens of tbe donor. The mechanism for the generation of these cytotoxic g cells CTC involves a complex series of reactions on the cellular level which is believed to be initiated by tbe presentation to, and recognition by, tbe host s macrophage cells, of the transplantation antigens on tbe donor graft.The macrophage cells respond by synthesis and xelease of a first signal interleukin 1 lIt i . The interleukin 1, in turn, together with a comitogenic blood serum glycoprotein PHILIP, as discussed in U S PatentApplication, Serial No. 255,251, filed April 17, 1981, incorporated herein by reference activates a particular subpopulation of accessory cells, generally believed to be T helper cells, for production of a second signal interleukin 2 IL 2 also known as T cell growth factor TCGF . It is the second signal which acts on the subpopulation of g cells known as T effector cells to effect g cell growth. The g cell blasts are tbe cytotoxic T cells or killer T cells which specifically recognize the graft cells and effect tbe graft rejection process.It bas recently been reported that asialo GM1, which is a glycosphingolipid, is a surface com ponent densely expressed on mouse NK natural killer cells and further that the natural killing function of tbe NK cells which are closely related to cytotoxic T cells and perhaps the NK cells themselves are destroyed by anti asialo GN1 antibodies Masataka Kasai al. A glycolipid on the surface of mouse natural killer cells11, Bur. J. Immunol., Vol 10, pages 175 180 1980 , and Masataka Kasai al. 111n vivo effect of anti asialo GM1 antibody on natural killer activity , Nature, Vol. 291, pages 334 335 May 28,, 1981 .This finding corfirms the experimental results and hypotheses of the present inventors, that desialo G1 is the surface receptor on human T effector cells which directly receives the second signal from interleukin 2 or perhaps from a blastogenic factor which in turn causes tbe modification of tbe surface receptor to a form which can react with IL 2 or still alternatively which causes the expression on the T effector cell of a new surface receptor which can react with IS 2. Ry whichever of these mechanisms the W effector cells are transformed to cytotoxic g cells, the present invention has been completed on the basis of the finding that incorporating desialo GM1 or similar gangliosides in in vitro T cell culture systems containing IL 2 prevents proliferation of T cell blasts in growing T cell lines and or prevents transformation of g effector cells to g cell blasts.This observation therefore leads to an in vivo procedure for modification of the cell mediated immunological graft rejection mechanism by blocking the formation of cytotoxic g cells at the level of tbe T effector cells and without destroying macrophage cells. Accordingly, the procedure of the present invention is highly advantageous as compared to presently available techniques for transplant protection, particularly by the use of immunosuppressive drugs. Since immunosuppressive drugs such as cortisone derivatives function by killing the macrophage cells, they also inhibit other immunological reactions of the host such as the humoral antibody system. Therefore, such drugs will subject the patient to increased risk of infectious diseases.In addition, since conventional immunosuppressive therapy usually starts at dosage levels which do not entirely kill off the macrophage cells, there will be some production ofIL 1 and 1L 2 and resulting T cell blast formation.At the time of the graft transplantation therefore, the consequence of IL 2 and T cell blasts will allow the latter to proliferate until the IL 2 is consumed.This process generally requires several days. In contrast, the immunosuppressive blocking agents of this invention require less than 24 hours to effect lively terminate cytotoxic g cell proliferation and to kill off any existing cytotoxic g cells.Other common immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine and methotrexate are used because of their toxicity to dividing cells, and therefore pose the danger of toxicity for cells of the bone marrow and also of the small intestine. Such defect is not present with the ganglioside blocking agents of this invention.Accordingly, it can be seen that the present invention provides an effective method for immunosuppressive therapy in allogeneic graft transplantation operations by blocking soluble mediators which may be either or both of a blastogenic factor or interleukin 2 to thereby prevent proliferation of existing cytotoxic 2 cells and natural killer cells and to also prevent occurrence of blastogenesis of T effector cells to cytotoxic T cell blasts using gangliosides and ganglioside derivatives as the blocking agent. The transplantation of organ grafts such as kidney, heart, liver, pancreatic islets, bone marrow and the like, even when donor and recipient are carefully tissue type matched, inevitably involves the host versus graft and, in the case of bone marrow transplantation, graft versus host immunological cell mediated rejection mechanism. The rejection mechanism actually involves several potential pathways, see for example Essential immunology , 3rdEdition by Ivan Roitt, Blackwell Scientific Public ations 1977 , pages 234 239 , but the direct killing by sensitized T cells, i.e. cytotoxic T cells, is clearly the most important.Under normal circumstances, T effector cells are circulating in the blood system. Wben an organ is transplanted in the host, the host s macrophage cells coming into contact with the graft recognize it as foreign and, after a few days, become sensitized. This sensitization results in the production by the macrophages of interleukin 1 which in turn, with the comitogenic factor iEILIP induces cellular production of interleukin 2. IL 2 and probably also a blastogenic factor which is itself synthesized by either the sensitized macrophage cells or by an accessory cell, probably a g cell, activate resting 2 effector cells to form 2 cell blasts, i.e. cytotoxic T cells. If nothing is done to prevent the formation of the cytotoxic 2 cells, they will attack and kill the graft cells until the entire graft is destroyed.Therefore, to prevent the g effector cells from undergoing blastogenesis to their activated natural killing form, the T effector cell must somehow be prevented from receiving the signal from 111 2 and or the blastogenic factor. Since it is known that the relevant surface receptor on the g effector cell is desialo GM1, either or both of theII 2 or blastogenic factor must be capable of reacting with this ganglioside.Accordingly, by introducing a sufficient quantity of desialo GM1 or structurally similar ganglioside to the host, all or nearly all of the soluble mediators which would otherwise react with the desialo GM1 surface receptor will instead react with the introduced desialo GM1 blocking agent. he blastogenic signal is thereby prevented from activating the T effector cell and no blast transformation takes place.Other blocking agents which can be used, in addition to desialo GM1 include other desialylated gangliosides such as desialo GD and its subgroups, especially Glia and GD1b, and GIG and its subgroups, especially Gi1. Desialo or asialo GM1 has the formula Gal beta 1 3 GalNac beta 1 4 Glc beta 1 1 Cer. The formula of the gangliosides GD1a, GD1b and GT1 are described on page 106 in Cell surface carbohydrate chemistry edited by R. E. barmen, Academic Press Inc. 1978 , chapter by L. D. Xohn al.. The definition of these abbreviations are provided, for example, in 2he Nomenclature of lipids 2, Eur. J. Biochem. 79, 11 1977 .Desialo GM1 and the other useful ganglioside blocking agents are commercially available in highly purified form.The gangliosides are characterized by the presence of a portion which is soluble in organic solvents, and a portion which is soluble in aqueous solvents.Accordingly, the gangliosides can be dissolved in an aqueous organic solvent mixture or coupled to water soluble organic carriers. Suitable organic carriers would include, for example, albumin, antibodies, lectins, glycoproteins, desoxyribonucleic acid, dextrans and liposomes.techniques for the use of these organic carriers can be found in Drug Carriers in Biology andMedicine edited by G. Gregoriadis, Academic Press, 1979 . Suitable organic solvent would include for example alcohol and Dimetbylsulfoxide. Organic solvent to water ratios from about 0 100 to about 1 100 can be used. The ganglioside blocking agent is administered to the patient in an amount which is sufficient to react with the soluble mediators of the T cell blast transformation which would be available for reaction with the desialo GM1 surface receptors. Generally, amounts of blocking agent in the range from about 0.5 pg to 10 mg per kilogram of body weight per day will be sufficient to effectively suppress T cell blastogenesis and g cell proliferation.The effective daily dosage can be administered as a single inection or as two or more injections.However, since it is most probable that the ganglioside is reacting with interleukin 2, a single daily application should be sufficient because about a 24 hour period is required for maximal production of 111 2. Each injection can be administered intravenously.However, it is also within the scope of the invention to provide the ganglioside blocking agent in an oral dosage form which will allow the ganglioside to be absorbed intact into the blood system in the prescribed amounts. In order to minimize the risk of infections after the operation, it seems convenient not to start the treatment with the blocking agent until about two days after the patient has recieved the graft. It is well established that the rejection mechanism will not be activated until at least two days after the operation. The method of this invention can be used whenever it is necessary to prevent rejection of a graft of an organ from a donor to a host for any degree of relationship, i.e. siblings parent child tissue typed but unrelated, etc. In general the principal applications presently contemplated include heart, kidney, liver, pancreatic islets, and bone marrow transplants.The present invention is further illustrated by the following non limiting Examples Example 1The following test is conducted to determine the inhibition of tumor cell killing capability of cytotoxic T cells activated by interleukin 2. Tumor cells from XeLa strain are labelled with radioactive chromium. The cells are washed and divided into two portions comprising the same cell number. Loth portions are coincubated with cytotoxic T lymphoblasts for 18 hours. The culture medium contains IL 2. To one of tbe portions, at the beginning of the cocultivation, desialo GM1 is added in concentration of 2 micrograms per ml of culture medium. The culture medium is decanted and the cells are pelleted in a centrifuge. The release of chromium from the labelled tumor cells indicates that the cells have been killed. The results are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 of Cr released Target Target Target and and and 2 cell control IL 2 without 85.1 4.1 0.1 asialo GPI1 with 5.3 3.8 asialo GM1 Example 2This Example illustrates that asialo GMI reacts with a soluble mediator for T lymphocyte blastogenesis inhibiting cytotoxic 2 cell formation.Peripheral blood lymphocytes are isolated by a density gradient centrifugation on ficoll hypaque and incubated 24 hours in the absence of serum proteins. Interleukin 2 containing tissue culture mediumRPMI 1640 is treated with asialo GM1 in a concentration of 5 micrograms per ml of culture medium. The incubation with asialo GI is performed at 3700 for 30 minutes. Thereafter,the treated culture medium is dialysed against RPMI 1640 without supplements for 24 hours at a temperature of 400. The cells are incubated in the dialysed and thus containing no free asialo GM1 culture medium for 7 days. For dialysis, the critical micellar concentration CMC of the ganglioside has to be regarded. If it is exceeded, dialysis will be impossible. CflC values for each ganglioside have been established, and are readily available. In contrast to the situation in controls not treated with asialo GM1, no blast transformation of g cells is observed.
