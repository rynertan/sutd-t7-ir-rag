# Apparatus and method for separation of sausage chubs.

## Abstract
An apparatus and a method are provided in which a connecting portion between sausage chubs is positioned in an inner end of a slot in a guide structure and a blade unit is then moved within the guide structure to sever the connect ing portion. In one embodiment, two spaced blades 19,20 are provided which can cut between facing surfaces 23,24 of adjacent chubs 59,60 and the outer sides of clips 57,58 on the ends of a connecting portion 56 . The blades are pivotal and have beveled edges. A spacer 28 between the blades has a projecting portion 51 engaging the connecting portion 56 to provide a tensioning action which facilitates cutting. In another embodiment, a single thin blade moves between a pair of thin plates 77,78 of a guide structure 75 for severing of a very short connecting portion 72 between sausage chubs 73,74 . The blades may be operated manu ally as by fluid operated cylinders, solenoids or other actuat ing means.
