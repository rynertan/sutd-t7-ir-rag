# Physically ameliorated styrene polymer thermoplastic elastomer polyblends.

## Abstract
Several important properties including environmental stress crack resistance of styrene polymer thermoplastic elastomer polyblends are significantly enhanced by incor poration in the SP TE polyblend a thermally activable, orga nic peroxide in combination with an optimizing crosslinking supplement. Besides improving environmental stress crack resistance, the tensile strength, elongation and toughness are also significantly ameliorated in the SP TE polyblends.
