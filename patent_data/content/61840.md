Such granules can be preformed granules suitable for application to the soil without further treatment. These granules can be made either by impregnating pellets of filler with the active ingredient or by pelleting a mixture of the active ingredient and powdered filler.Compositions for dressing seed, for example, may comprise an agent for example a mineral oil for assisting the adhesion of the composition to the seed alternatively the active ingredient can be formulated for seed dressing purposes using an organic solvent for example N methylpyrrolidone or dimethylformamide . The compositions may also be in the form of dispersible powders, granules or grains comprising a wetting agent to facilitate the dispersion in liquids of the powder or grains which may contain also fillers and suspending agents. The aqueous dispersions or emulsions may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient s in an organic solvent optionally containing wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent s and then adding the mixture to water which may also contain wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent s . Suitable organic solvents are ethylene dichloride, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol, diacetone alcohol, toluene, kerosene, methylnaphthalene, the xylenes, trichloroethyl ene, furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, and glycol ethers e.g. 2 ethoxyethanol and 2butoxyethanol .

The compounds can be mixed in the dry state with a pyrotechnic mixture to form a composition suitable for generating in enclosed spaces a smoke containing the compounds. Alternatively, the compounds may be used in a microencapsulated form. By including suitable additives, for example additives for improving the distribution, adhesive power and resistance to rain on treated surfaces, the different compositions can be hetter adapted for various utilities. The compounds can be used as mixtures with fertilisers e.g. nitrogen , potassium or phosphorus containing fertilisers . Compositions comprising only granules of fertiliser incorporating, for example coated with, the compound, are preferred. Such granules suitably contain up to 25 by weight of the compound. The invention therefore also provides a fertiliser composition comprising the compound of general formula I or a salt or metal complex.thereof. The compositions may also be in the form of liquid preparations for use as dips or sprays which are generally aqueous dispersions or emulsions containing the active ingredient in the presence of one or more surfactants e.g.wetting agent s , dispersing agent s , emulsifying agent s or suspending agent s .

Suitable anionic agents are soaps, salts of aliphatic monoesters of sulphuric acid for example sodium lauryl sulphate , and salts of sulphonated aromatic compounds for example sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate, sodium, calcium or ammonium lignosulphonate, butylnaphthalene sulphonate, and a mixture of sodium diisopropyl and triisopropylnaphthalene sulphonates . Suitable non ionic agents are the condensation products of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols such as oleyl or cetyl alcohol, or with alkyl phenols such as octyl or nonyl phenol and octylcresol. Other non ionic agents are the partial esters derived from long chain fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, the condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, and the lecithins. Suitable suspending agents are hydrophilic colloids for example polyvinylpyrrolidone and sodium carboxymethylcellulose , and the vegetable gums for example gum acacia and gum tragacanth . The compositions for use as aqueous dispersions or emulsions are generally supplied in the form of a concentrate containing a high proportion of the active ingredient s , the concentrate to be diluted with water before use. These concentrates often should be able to withstand storage for prolonged periods and after such storage be capable of dilution with water in order to form aqueous preparations which remain homogeneous for. a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional spray equipment. The concentrates may conveniently contain up to 95t, suitably 10 85 , for example 25 60 , by weight of the active ingredient s .These concentrates suitably contain organic acids e.g.alkaryl or aryl sulphonic acids such as xylenesulphonic acid or dodecylbenzenesulphonic acid since the presence of such acids can increase the solubility of the active ingredient s in the polar solvents often used in the concentrates. The concentrates suitably contain also a high proportion of surfactants so that sufficiently stable emulsions in water can be obtained. After dilution to form aqueous preparations, such preparations may contain varying amounts of the active ingredient s depending upon the intended purpose, but an aqueous preparation containing 0.0005 or 0.01 to 108 by weight of active ingredient s may be used.

The test compounds were formulated either by bead milling with aqueous Dispersol T or as a solution in acetone or acetone ethanol which was diluted to the required concentration immediately before use. For the foliage diseases, suspensions 100 ppm active ingredient were sprayed on to the soil. Exceptions to this were the tests on Botrytis cinerea, Plasmopara viticola and Venturia inaequalis. The sprays were applied to maximum retention and the root drenches to a final concentration equivalent to approximately 40 ppm a.i. dry soil.Tween 20, to give a final concentration of 0.05 , was added when the sprays were applied to cereals. For most of the tests the compound was applied to the soil roots and to the foliage by spraying one or two days before the plant was inoculated with the diseases.An exception was the test on Erysiphe graminis in which the plants were inoculated 24 hours before treatment.
