# Biocidal gas sterilization method and apparatus.

## Abstract
In a method and apparatus for timely determination of potentially harmful biocidal gas leakage from a pressurized chamber during sterilizing operations, biocidal gas make up values are monitored during the sterilizing phase to provide prompt warning of biocidal gas leakage. The timing of prese lected pressure decrement gas make up charges along 92 are measured and compared to minimum acceptable gas make up charge times. In addition, absorption of biocidal gas by the load can be compensated for, if timing along the first pressure decrement along 84 , in sterilizing operations where load absorption is a significant factor. Also, gas absorption by the load can be predicted from steam absorption data ob tained during pressure controlled conditioning cycles, by mon itoring steam introduction along 34 .
