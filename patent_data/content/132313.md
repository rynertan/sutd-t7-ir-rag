# Reagents, test kits and methods for the detection of cannabinoids.

## Abstract
The invention provides a stable solid reagent for use in a prepackaged test kit for the detection of cannabinoids comprising a diazonium salt which undergoes characteris tic color change when combined with a cannabinoid under basic conditions, the salt comprising an anion capable of causing the entire salt including the diazonium cation thereof to dissolve in an organic solvent when combined therewith to form a stable liquid reagent for the detection of cannabinoids. The invention also provides a stable liquid reagent comprising the aforementioned diazonium salt and an organic solvent as well as providing prepackaged reagent test kits containing the aforementioned reagents and methods for detecting cannabinoids using the reagents of the invention.
