# Method for forming channels of high fluid conductivity in formation parts around a borehole.

## Abstract
A method for forming channels of high fluid conductivity in relatively soft acid soluble formation parts around a bore hole penetrating such formation, said method comprising the sequential steps of 1 installing a casing in the well, and introducing in the wall of the casing a plurality of perforations arranged over at least part of the said wall where facing the formation 2 inducing in the formation a fracture communicating with the perforations and containing a viscous fluid 3 injecting an acid solution through the perforations into the fracture at a pressure at which the fracture remains open, the viscosity ratio between the viscous fluid and the acid solution being chosen such that the viscous fluid is displaced in the fracture in an unstable manner by the acid solution 4 continuing the injection of the acid solution through the perforations until channels have been etched in areas of the fracture walls that face each other 5 injecting a viscous carrying fluid carrying a propping agent through the perforations into the fracture at a pressure at which the fracture remains open, the viscosity of the carrying fluid being at least equal to the viscosity of the acid solution 6 continuing the injection of the carrying fluid and the propping agent until propping agent is present in the fracture between at least part of those areas of the fracture walls wherein channels have been etched 7 lowering the fluid pressure in the fracture, thereby allowing the fracture walls to be displaced to closing position, in which position the walls of the channels are supported by propping agent and 8 lowering the viscosity of the viscous fluids.
