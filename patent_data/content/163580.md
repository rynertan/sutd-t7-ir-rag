## Description
The present invention relates to an integrated circuit having memory cells. The integrated circuit according to the present invention is used for a memory device having a redundant circuit portion for replacing failed circuits. In general, an integrated circuit device for a semiconductor memory is provided with redundant bit type memory cells in addition to the usually used memory cells. These are used to replace failed memory cells or even to replace an entire bit line containing failed memory cells, in the latter case by a redundant bit line containing redundant memory cells. This increases the yield of the products in the manufacture of integrated circuits. In such an integrated circuit, read only memories ROM s are provided for storing the addresses of the failed memory cells. When an input address signal coincides with the address of a failed memory cell stored in the ROM s, the circuit is switched to access a redundant memory cell instead of the failed memory cell. Accordingly, quick and correct detection of the written state of the ROM s is important. However, 2 Also, when several fuses are used for each bit in the ROM s, it is impossible to determine the blow out state of each of the fuses, although the output state of the ROM s can be determined. This is undesirable and causes problems in an integrated circuit device for a semiconductor memory. An example of a semiconductor memory with a redundant element identification circuit is disclosed in WO A 82 02793. According to this prior art, a redundant decoder is provided via a signal line. The redundant decoder is programmed with the addresses of the defective memory cells so as to select a predetermined redundant memory cell when a received address corresponds to a defective memory cell. A test circuit is provided to indicate, by means of an output signal, when the decoder has selected a redundant memory cell. The output signal is applied to an indicator circuit which is enabled in a test mode by an abnormal condition detector. The output of that detector is then applied to an external pin. Another prior art semiconductor memory having a built in test circuit is disclosed in EP A 0086310. The test circuit is based on a series connected transistor and diode between a voltage source and an input connection. A capacitor is connected between the gate of the transistor and the input part. The test circuit discriminates the signal level of an internal node to be inspected as a function of the flow or non flow of a current from the input connection when it is supplied with a particular signal having a voltage level higher than the power source level. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved integrated circuit having memory cells, enabling quick and correct detection of the written state of the memory circuit in which the address information of the failed circuit portions is stored, and easy, reliable inspection of the integrated circuit having regular memory cells and redundant circuits without providing an additional external connection terminal of the integrated circuit. It is thus another object of the present invention to reduce the time required for the testing of an integrated circuit having regular memory cells and redundant circuits. It is still another object of the present invention to enable detection of the blow out state of each of the plurality of fuses used in the memory cells in the integrated circuit. According to the present invention, these objects are met by the semiconductor integrated circuit of claim 1. Before describing a preferred embodiment, an example of the prior art integrated circuit will be described with reference to Figs. 1, 2, and 3. The device of Fig. 1 includes coincidence detection circuits 2, 2, ..., corresponding to the number of bits of the input address signals A Non inverted and inverted address signals A When coincidence is attained, the impedance between the voltage source V Hence, when all of the coincidence detection circuits indicate coincidence, the potential of the control line 31 N The ROM s in the coincidence detection circuits store the address of failed memory cell. When the input address signal coincides with the address of the failed memory cell stored in the ROM s, the potential of the control line 31 N An example of the structure of each of the coincidence detection circuits 2, 2, ... is shown in Fig. 2. In the circuit of Fig. 2, a fuse 211 and a transistor 213 constitute a fuse blow out type ROM. One bit of the address information of a failed memory cell is stored in this ROM. Transistors 231 and 232 constitute an inverter circuit. Transistors 241 to 244 constitute a comparison circuit in the form of an exclusive OR gate circuit. The series connected transistors 241 and 242 and the series connected transistors 243 and 244 are connected between the control line 31 N The gate of the transistor 241 is connected to the output node N In the circuit of Fig. 2, if the fuse 211 is blown, the potential of the output node N In the circuit of Fig. 2, if the fuse is not blown, the potential of the node N Thus, in the circuit of Fig. 2, the fuse blow put type ROM 211, 213 stores the address data 0 by the blown state of the fuse 211 and stores the address data 1 by the non blown state of the fuse 211. Using such stored data, when an input address signal A coincides with the stored data, the potential of the control line 31 N Figure 3 shows another example of the structure of the coincidence detection circuits 2, 2, ... shown in Fig. 1. The ROM portion of the coincidence detection circuit of Fig. 3 includes a series connected fuse 211 and a depletion type transistor 213, a series connected fuse 212 and a depletion type transistor 214, and a NAND gate circuit consisting of a series connected depletion type transistor 221, enhancement type transistor 222, and enhancement type transistor 223. When one or more of the fuses 211 and 212 is blown, one of the transistors 222 and 223 is in the OFF state. Hence, the potential of the node N In order to test the data written in state of the ROM portions of the coincidence detection circuits shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 corresponding to the bits of the address signal, the input address signals A A semiconductor integrated circuit according to an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in Fig. 4. The circuit of Fig. 4 includes coincidence detection circuits 2, 2, ..., a load transistor 32, an output circuit consisting of transistors 61 and 62, and an external connection terminal 7. The transistor 32 is connected between a voltage source V The transistors 61 and 62 are connected in series between the voltage source V Non inverted and inverted signals A Thus, when all of the outputs of the coincidence detection circuits 2, 2, ... indicate coincidence, the potential of the control line 31 N Based on this operation, a redundant memory cell is accessed instead of a failed memory cell only when the potential of the control line 31 N Various tests of the integrated circuit can be carried out conveniently by using the information concerning failed bits stored in the ROM s in the coincidence detection circuits. The detection of the information stored in the ROM s is carried out by inputting a sequence of varying addresses A The above description assumes storage of only a single failure address. When plural failure addresses exist, a plurality of the circuits shown in Fig. 4 are used. The semiconductor integrated circuit further provides a status detection function indicating the written state of one of a plurality of memory cells in the memory from a terminal connected commonly to the plural memory cells, by supplying a specific address signal corresponding to that one memory cell. Each of the coincidence detection circuits 2, 2,... has two output terminals, one connected with a control line 31 N When the input signal address does not coincide with the address stored in the ROM s, the potential of the control line 41 N Thus, from the potential of the external connection terminal 7, when the current starts to flow through the external connection terminal, it is possible to detect the coincidence between the input signal address and the address stored in the ROM s and to confirm the address of the failed portion of the circuit. The indication of a resistor 8 and a voltage source V The coincidence detection circuit shown in Fig. 2 is used for each of the coincidence detection circuits 2, 2,... in the circuit shown in Fig. 4. Each of the coincidence detection circuits 2,2, ... includes a memory portion 21, a comparison portion 24, and a status detection portion 25. The structure of the coincidence detection circuit 2 is illustrated in Fig. 5. The status detection portion 25 includes transistors 2501 and 2502, which are connected in series between a detection line 41 N In the circuit of Fig. 5, the impedance between the control line 31 N In the circuit of Fig. 5, the potential of the input signal A is made HIGH in order to detect the storage state of the ROM 21, that is, the state of the fuse 211. When the potential of the input signal A is HIGH, the transistor 2502 becomes ON, and the information of the state of the fuse 211 is output to the detection line 41 N That is, when the fuse 211 is blown, the potential of the node N In this case, it should be noted that it is required that the potential of just one bit of the address signal be made HIGH and the potentials of all of the other bits of the address signal be made LOW. When the fuse 211 is not blown, the potential of the node N Another example of the structure of the coincidence detection circuit is shown in Fig. 6. The circuit of Fig. 6 is similar to the circuit of Fig. 3, except that the status detection circuit 25 consisting of transistors 2503 to 2507 is added. A non inverted selection signal A In order to detect the state of the fuse 211, the address signal A and the non inverted signal A Under this condition, when the transistor 2504 is turned on or off corresponding to the potential of the node N Hence, when the fuse 211 is blown, the potential of the node N Similarly, by making the address signal A HIGH and the selection signal A Thus, in the circuit of Fig. 6, the state of each of the fuses 211 and 212 can be detected separately. The circuit of Fig. 6 is particularly useful for the case where the memory cell matrix is divided by rows or by columns to be divided into a plurality of blocks in which the switching to the redundant circuit is carried out simultaneously in parallel with regard to the plurality of blocks. Another example of the structure of the coincidence detection circuit is shown in Fig. 7. The circuit of Fig. 7 includes a status detection circuit 25, consisting of the transistors 2508 to 2511, and detection lines 41 N In the circuit of Fig. 7, the transistors 2509 and 2511 are caused to be ON by making the address signal A high. Under this condition, when the fuse 211 is blown, the potential of the node N Similarly, when the fuse 212 is blown, the transistor 2510 is OFF, and, accordingly, the potential of the detection line 51 N Thus, in the circuit of Fig. 7, by making the address signal A HIGH, information on the states of the fuses 211 and 212 is output to the detection lines 41 N In the above described embodiments, the address signal is increased successively by one bit for detecting the state of the ROM corresponding to each of the bits of the address signal. However, in the circuit of Fig. 5, when an inverted address signal By making the address signal applied to the transistor 2502 to be, bit by bit, a non inverted address signal or an inverted address signal, it is possible to select any pattern of address signals for detecting the written state of the ROM. An example of the above described selection of an arbitrary pattern of the address signal is shown in the following tables A and B . Table A indicates the address signal supplied to the gate of the transistor 2502. Table B indicates the address pattern for detecting the state of the ROM. Another example of the structure of the coincidence detection circuit is shown in Fig. 8. The circuit of Fig. 8 includes a status detection circuit 25 consisting of transistors 2512, 2521, 2522, ... 252k. The gate of the transistor 2512 receives the potential of the node N In the circuit of Fig. 8, 2 A further example of the structure of the coincidence detection circuit is shown in Fig. 9. The circuit of Fig. 9 includes a status detection circuit 25 consisting of transistors 2531, 2532, 2541a, 2541b, 2542, 2543, ... 254k. The operation of the circuit of Fig. 9 will be apparent from the operations of the circuit of Fig. 6 and the circuit of Fig. 8.
