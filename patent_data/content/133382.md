# Radiofrequency coil.

## Abstract
A radiofrequency coil 1 is described which comprises a pair of electrically conductive loops 4,5 connected in series. The loops 4, 5 are arranged substantially symmetrically about a plane 6 whereby in use a radiofrequency magnetic field in duced between the loops 4, 5 passes through the plane 6 substantially at right angles to the plane. The coil 1 is parti cularly applicable for use in NMR imaging apparatus.
