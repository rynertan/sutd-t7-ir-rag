# Polymer composition.

## Abstract
A crosslinkable composition comprising a silyl modified ethylene co polymer, a defined phosphorus or antimony compound and optionally a silanol condensation catalyst. The silyl modified polymer has hydrolysable silane groups introduced therein by copolymerisation, grafting or trans esterification. The phosphorus or antimony compound e.g. tributyl phosphite reduces premature crosslinking during extrusion of the composition.
