# Method for testing DC motors.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a DC parameter motor tester based on cur rent time response, which tester does not require coupling of the motor 14 to some mechanical device or measuring other noise sensitive parameters taken from only a few discrete data points. As is disclosed, the steady state speed of the motor is determined from the frequency composition of the commuta tion noise and ripple in the steady state current by performing through a computer 10 a fast fourier transform on the steady state current to determine its power spectral density which shows the frequency composition of the steady state current waveform by giving the power in the waveform at each fre quency. The frequency at which the most power exists is di vided by the number or twice the number, depending upon the construction of the motor, of commutation segments in the motor to determine the motor s frequency of rotation or velo city at measured power input. The parameters which are de rived from the current time response points are taken from data in which such data has a significant, if not dominant influ ence.
