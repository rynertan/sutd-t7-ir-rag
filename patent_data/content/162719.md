# THETA 3, A NOVEL CRYSTALLINE ALUMINOSILICATE AND ITS PREPARATION

## Abstract
A crystalline aluminosilicate of the ZSM 12 family, desig nated Theta 3, having the following composition in terms of the mole ratios of oxides 0.9 0.2 M₂ nO Al₂O3 xSiO₂ yH₂O wherein M is a cation of valance n, x is at least 20 and y x is 0 to 30 and an XRD pattern Cu K alpha radiation distin guished by a very strong line at 3.82 0.08 Angstroms. Theta 3 is prepared by hydrothermal crystallisation from a gel con taining a quaternary nitrogen compound of the formula BzNR ₃X wherein Bz is a benzyl radical, R is a hydrocarbyl group and X is an anion.
