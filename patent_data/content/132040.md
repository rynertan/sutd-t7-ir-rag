# Nonmagnetic particles to improve properties of magnetic recording compositions.

## Abstract
Ferromagnetic recording elements with improved physi cal properties have from 20 to 50 of the volume of ferroma gnetic particles replaced by nonmagnetic particles of a size smaller than the thickness of the magnetic layer.
