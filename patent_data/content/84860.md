## Description
A NOVEL COMPOUND 5 CHLORO 1 BROMO 1 PENTYNE AND A METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a novel compound 5 chloro bromo l pentyne and a method for the preparation thereof. As is well known, a method is under rapid growing for the extermination or control of pests or noxious insects in the fields by use of a sex pheromone of the respective insect and the chemical structures of several sex pheromone compounds have already been established. For example, the sex pheromone excreted by Douglas fir tussock moth causing great damages to the forests in western North America is chemically Z 6 heneicosen 11 one and it is eagerly desired to develop a convenient and efficient method for the synthesis of this compound. The inventors have also undertaken extensive investigations with such an object and, in the course of their experimental works, they arrived at a discovery of a novel compound which is useful as an intermediate for the synthesis of the above mentioned sex pheromone compound. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The novel compound of the present invention, which is useful as an intermediate for the industrial production of the sex pheromone compound Z 6 heneicosen 11 one by a synthetic method, is 5 chloro 1 bromo 1 pentyne expressed by the structural formula BrCC CH2 CH2 CH2Cl and not described in any prior art literatures. The novel compound of the invention 5 chloro l bromo l pentyne can readily be obtained chemically by the reaction of potassium hypobromite and 5 chloro 1 pentyne in an aqueous reaction medium. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS As is mentioned above, the 5 chloro 1 bromo 1 pentyne as the compound of the invention can be synthesized by adding 5 chloro 1 pentyne into an aqueous solution of potassium hypobromite, which can be obtained by introducing bromine into an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide in a concentration of about 30 , under agitation to effect the reaction at about 10 to 40 oC followed by the phase separation of the reaction mixture and distillatin of the organic phase under reduced pressure. The yield of the desired compound 5chloro 1 bromo 1 pentyne in the above described procedure is usually about 85 of the theoretical value.The reaction is expressed by the following reaction equation EMI2.1 5 Chloro 1 pentyne as the starting material in the above reaction is a known compound and can be obtained readily, for example, by the reaction of 1 bromo 3 chloropropane with sodium acetylide in liquid ammonia. As is mentioned above, 5 chloro l bromo l pentyne of the present invention is a useful compound as an intermediate for the synthetic preparation of Z 6 heneicosen 11 one.That is, 5 chloro 1 bromo 1 pentyne is reacted with n pentylmagnesium chloride, i.e. the Grignard reagent of n pentyl chloride, to form decynyl chloride which can be converted to Z 4 decenyl chloride by the partial hydrogenation reaction. The desired Z 6 heneicosen 11 one can be obtained by the reaction of Z 4 decenylmagnesium chloride, i.e. theGrignard reagent of the above obtained Z 4 decenyl chloride, with undecylic acid anhydride. Z 6 Heneicosen 11 one is the sex pheromone compound excreted by the pests Douglas fir tussock moth causing great damages in the forests in the western North America and can be usd as an exterminating or controlling agent for the insects since even a trace amount of the compound floating in the air may disturb the intersexual communication of the insect species. In the following, an example is given for the synthesis and identification of the inventive compound 5 chloro 1 bromo 1 pentyne and the synthetic preparation of Z 6 heneicosen ii one starting with the inventive compound as the intermediate.Example. Into a 400 ml portion of an aqueous solution containing 120 g of potassium hydroxide dissolved therein kept at 10 to 20 oC were added dropwise 150 g of bromine under agitation to effect the reaction between them. Thereafter, 60 g of 5chloro 1 pentyne were added to this reaction mixture containing the above obtained potassium hypobromite and the reaction of them was performed in an atmosphere of air with agitation at a reaction temperature of 20 oC for 48 hoursAfter the end of the above reaction time, the reaction mixture was subjected to the phase separation and the organic solution in the upper layer was distilled under reduced pressure to give 90.3 g of a fraction boiling at 62 oC under a pressure of 2 mmHg as the reaction product. This product was analyzed by mass spectrometry to give the results shown below, from which this product was identified to be the desired 5 chloro 1 bromo 1 pentyne.

Following is a description of the preparation of Z 6heneicosen 11 one from the above obtained 5 chloro 1 bromo 1 pentyne. A tetrahydrofuran solution of a Grignard reagent n pentylmagnesium chloride was prepared by the dropwise addition of 53.3 g 0.5 mole of n pentyl chloride into a mixture of 12 g of magnesium metal, 1 mg of iodine and 300 ml of tetrahydrofuran at a temperature of NO to 50 OC under a stream of nitrogen gas. Into another reaction vessel were taken 91 g 0.5 mole of 5 chloro 1 bromo 1 pentyne, 300 ml of tetrahydrofuran and 7.5 g of copper I bromide to form a reaction mixture, into which the solution of n pentylmagnesium chloride in tetrahydrofuran prepared above was added dropwise at a temperature of 5 to 10 OC under a stream of nitrogen gas. After compile tion of the dropwise addition of the tetrahydrofuran solution, agitation was further continued for additional one hour at 20 OC and then the reaction mixture was subjected to hydrolysis in an aqueous solution of ammonium chloride and hydrogen chloride followed by phase separation of the mixture. The organic phase thus taken was concentrated by distillation to give 51.8 g of 4 decynyl chloride, which amount corresponded to about 60 yield of the theoretical value. The above obtained 4 decynyl chloride was converted toZ 4 decenyl chloride by the partial hydrogenation reaction in methyl alcohol in the presence of a palladium catalyst supported on barium sulfate and this Z 4 decenyl chloride was reacted with magnesium metal in tetrahydrofuran to give a Grignard reagent Z 4 decenylmagnesium chloride which was further reacted with undecylic acid anhydride to give Z 6heneicosen ll one.
