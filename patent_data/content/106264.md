# Power switch apparatus.

## Abstract
A supporting insulator 9 to support the driving mechanism 6 of a disconnect switch part 100 and a supporting insulator 9 of a breaker 10 are unified. The heights of the fixed contact 4 and the driving mechanism 6 of the disconnect switch part 100 as well as the height of the upper end of the common supporting insulator 9 support ing the breaker 10 are substantially the same. Setting area is thus decreased, while ensuring a high spatial insulation distance.
