# CYANOHETEROCYCLIC SULFONYLUREAS

## Abstract
Sulfonylurea derivative of the formula JSO₂NHA wherein W is O or S R is H or CH₃ H is a mono or bicyclic cyanoheterocylic group J is a substituted aromatic or heteroaromatic group and their agriculturally suitable salts, exhibit herbicidal activity. Some also show a plant growth regulant effect. The novel compounds may be made by a variety of methods, e.g. by reacting an appropriate sulfonylisocyanate or sulfonylisothiocyanate JSO₂NCW with an appropriate cyanoheterocylic amine HA
