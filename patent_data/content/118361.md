# FORMATION OF NONWOVEN WEBS OR BATTS FROM CONTINUOUS FILAMENT TOW OR YARN STRANDS

## Abstract
A method and machine for forming nonwoven batts containing refractory fibers such as carbon, glass, ceramic or metallic fibers, includes a conveying table 12 provided with scalloped rollers 90, 92 which separate tows of filaments 16 and spread the filaments on a conveying table. A feed roller 80 holds the filaments on the table so that they are conveyed to a rotating lickerin 60 . The lickerin 60 is provided with teeth 62 which grasp the filaments so that a tensile force is applied thereto, thereby breaking the fila ments at structurally weak points in the filaments. The fibers are mixed with textile fibers and transferred to a foraminous condenser 144 by blowing the fibers through a duct 112 . The fibers are arranged on the conveyor 114 in a random fashion to form a batt.
