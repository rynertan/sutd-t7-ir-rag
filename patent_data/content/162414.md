## Abstract
A peptide capable of forming an amphipathic helix containing a sequence comprising A1 B1 B2 C1 D B3 B4 A2 C2 B5 B6 A3 C3 B7 C4 A4 B8 B9 wherein A1, A2, A3 and A4 are independently aspartic acid or glutamic acid, or homologues or analogues thereof B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B7 and B9, are independently tryptophan, phenylalanine, leucine, alanine, tyrosine, isoleucine, valine or alpha naphthylalanine, or homologues or analogues thereof C1, C2, C3, and C4 are independently lysine or arginine, or homologues, or analogues thereof, and D is serine, threonine, alanine, glycine, or histidine provided that, when A1 and A2 are aspartic acid, A3 and A4 are glutamic acid, B2 and B7 are leucine B3 and B9 are phenylalanine, B4 is tyrosin B5 is valine, C1, C2, C3, and C4 are lysine, B6, B8, and D are alanine, B1 is not tryptophan, and a pharmaceutical composition containing said peptide.
