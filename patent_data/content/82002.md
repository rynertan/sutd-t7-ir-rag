## Description
METHOD OF PREPARING 23 MONOESTERS OF OMT AND DMT This invention relates to an improved method of preparing 23 monoester derivatives of 5 0 myeaminosyl tylonolide OMT and demycinosyltylosin DMT which comprises carrying out the esterification of OMT or DMT at low toy room temperatures with an appropriately selected acylating agent in the presence of an external base, that is to say a base in addition to the OMT orDMT itself, until acylation of the 23 hydroxyl group is substantially complete. Suitable external bases include tertiary amines such as pyridine or 2,4,6collidine. The 23 monoesters of OMT are compounds of formula I EMI1.1 wherein R is a specified acyl group. The 23 monoesters of DMT are compounds of formula it EMI2.1 wherein R is an acyl group. Previously, it was necessary to prepare 2I,4 ,23 trl 0 acyl derivatives of OMT or 2 ,23 di O acyl derivatives of DMT and then remove the acyl groups at the 2 ,41 posltions of OMT or the 2 position of DMT in order to prepare 23 monoester derivatives of OMT orDMT. The method of this invention provides a direct route whereby OMT or DMT can be selectively acylated on the 23 hydroxyl group to give the desired 23 monoester derivative. The 23 monoester derivatives of OMT and DMT are useful artibiotics and or intermediates to antibiotics. This invention relates to an improved method of preparing new antibiotics. In particular, this invention relates to a method of preparing the 23 monoester derivatives of OMT and DMT directly from OMT and DMT, respectively. This method comprises esterifying OMT or DMT with an appropriate acylating agent in the presence of an external base, such as pyridine or 2,4,6 collidine, until acylation of the 23 hydroxyl group is substantially complete. 23 monoester derivatives that can be prepared using the present invention include compounds of formulas I and II wherein R is an acyl group selected from EMI3.1 p is 0 or 1 m and n are integers from 0 to 4 R1 is hydrogen, halo, Cl C4 alkyl, C3 C8 cycloalkyl, phenyl, C5 C8 cycloalkenyl, naphthyl, indenyl, tetralinyl, decalinyl, adamantyl, l ethyl 1,4 dihydro 4 oxo 1,3 dioxolo 4,5 g cinnolin 3 yl cinnoxacinyl , a monocyclic heterocyclic ring system comprising 3 to 8 atoms or a bicyclic heterocyclic ring system comprising 6 to 11 atoms, provided that at least 1 atom of the ring system is carbon and at least 1 atom of the ring system is a heteroatom selected from 0, N, and S and whereinR1 and the connecting alkyl groups CH2 m and CH2 are optionally substituted by one or two halo, methyl, ethyl, methoxy, amino, N protected amino, methylamino, dimethylamino, nitro, acetoxy, acetamido, azido, carbomthoxy, carboxamido, cyano, or hydroxyl groups, provided that, if the substituent is other than halo or alkyl, there can be no more than one substituent on any connecting CH2 group X is O, S, NH , N CH3 , C C , CH CH , C CH3 CH , CH C CH3 or C CH3 C CH3 , Rê and R are C1 C5 alkyl or optionally substituted phenyl or.benzyl and the acid addition salts thereof. The terms C1 C4 alkyl and C1 C5 alkyl as used herein mean a straight or branched chain alkyl group containing from one to four or from one to five carbon atoms, respectively. In such a moiety, the alkyl group can optionally bear one to three halo substituents. Halo substituents are selected from the group consisting of C1, Br and F. Such groups include methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, n butyl, sec butyl, isobutyl, tert butyl, isovaleryl, chloromethyl, trichloromethyl and trifluoromethyl. The term optionally substituted phenyl or benzyl means that the phenyl portion of the moiety is optionally substituted by from one to five halo or methyl or by from one to two methoxyl, nitro or hydroxyl groups. The term C c cycloalkyl means a saturated 38 ring having from three to eight carbon atoms in the rIng. Examples of such rings are cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and cyclooctyl. By c 8 cycloalkenyl is meant a carbocylic ring which contains from five to eight carbon atoms and which also contains one or two double bonds. Cyclohexadienyl, cyclohexenyl, cyclopentenyl, and cyclooctadienyl are examples of such rings. The term monocyclic or bicyclic heterocyclic ring system as used herein includes saturated or unsaturated heterocyclic moieties containing at least one carbon atom and at least one heteroatom selected from oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur. Heterocyclic groups contemplated include unsaturated 3 to 8 membered monocyclic groups, for example, pyrrolyl, A 3 pyrrolinyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, pyridyl, pyrimidyl, pyra zinyl, pyridazinyl, triazinyl, triazolyl e.g., 4H 1,2,4 triazolyl, lH 1,2,3 triazolyl, etc. , tetrazolyl e.g., lH tetrazolyl, 2H tetrazolyl, etc. , oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, oxadiazolyl e.g., 1,2,4 oxadiazolyl, 1,3,4 oxadiazolyl, 1,2,5 oxadiazolyl, etc. , thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, thiadiazolyl e.g., 1,2,4 thiadiazolyl, 1,3,4 thiadiazolyl, 1,2,5 thiadiazolyl, etc. , thienyl, furanyl, etc saturated 3 to 8 membered monocyclic groups, for example, pyrrolidinyl, imidazolidinyl, piperi dinyl, piperazinyl, morpholinyl, thiazolidinyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, tetrahydrothienyl, tetrahydro pyranyl, dioxanyl, etc. unsaturated 6 to ll membered bicyclic groups, for example, indolyl, isoindolyl, coumaronyl, benzothiofuranyl, benzimidazolyl, quinolyl, iso quinolyl, benzopyrazolyl, cinnolinyl, quinazolinyl, benzoxazolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzoxazinyl, coumarinyl, etc. and the like. N protected amino means that the amino group is substituted by a suitable protecting group. Such a group must be one which is compatible with the other functional groups in OMT or DMT and which can be rally removed from the 23 O acylated derivative. One especially useful amino protecting group is the tertbutoxycarbonyl t BOC group. When R is an acyl group, wherein X is CH CH , C CH3 CH , CH C CH3 , or C CH3 C CH3 , the substituents on the double bond can be in either the cis or trans configuration. Illustrative R groups include those wherein EMI6.1 a R1 is hydrogen or C1 C4 alkyl b p is 0 c RÚ is optionally substituted phenyl d X is oxygen or NH and n is O or e X is oxygen or sulfur and n is 1 and 2 R is Rê SO2 and a Rê is C1 C5 alkyl or b Rê is optionally substituted phenyl. OMT is prepared as described by Marvin Gorman and Robert B, Morin in U.S. Patent 3,459,853, issuedAugust 5 1969. DMT is prepared as described byRichard H. Baltz, Gene M. Wild, and Eugene T. Seno in their copending application entitled DEMYCINOSYLTYLOSINAND PROCESS FOR ITS PRODUCTION, EPO Publication No.42250 Al. A preferred method of preparing OMT, by mild acid hydrolysis of DMT, is described by Baltz et al. inEPO Publication No. 42250 Al. The method of this invention comprises esterifying OMT or DMT directly on the 23 hydroxyl group by carrying out the esterification with an appropriately selected acylating agent in the presence of an external base, such as pyridine or 2,4,6 collidine, until acylation of the 23 hydroxyl group is substantially complete. The extent of acylation is monitored by thin layer chromatography TLC . Additional acylating agent is added as necessary to complete acylation of the 23 hydroxyl group. In the absence of external base, esterification of the 2 and 4 hydroxyl groups of OMT and of the 2 hydroxyl group of DMT is more facile than esterification of the 23 hydroxyl group. The previous method of preparing 23 monoesters of OMT or DMT, therefore, involved 1 preparing a 2 ,4 diacyl derivative of OMT or a 2 O acyl derivative of DMT, 2 esterifying these compounds on the 23 hydroxyl group, and 3 removing the 2 ,4 or 2 acyl group s to obtain the 23 monoester derivative. In the case bf either OMT orDMT, therefore, a series of three reactions was required to obtain the 23 monoester derivative. The present invention provides a method whereby the 23monoester derivatives can be prepared directly. Typical acylating agents useful in our process include anhydrides, halides and reactive esters of organic acids. When an acylating reagent contains fu ctt nal gr ps which can themselves be acylated, such a an rains group, such groups must, of course, be protected by a suitable protecting group. Tho temperature of the acylation reaction of this invention varies inversely with the reactivity of the acylating agent. With reactive acylating agents, such as acyl chlorides, the reaction is carried out at lower eemperatures, such as from about 8O0C. to about OOC. A temperature of about 780C. is preferred for such reactions. With less reactive acylating agents, such as anhydrides or reactive esters, the reaction is carried out at higher temperatures such as from about 200C. to about room temperature. An essential condition of the method of the present invention is that the acylation be carried out in the presence of an external base. External bases which are appropriate for this method are tertiary amines such as pyridine and 2,4,6 collidine. When sufficient external base is used the directing influence of the dimethylamino group at the 3 position in OMT and DMT is overcome The reaction of the present invention is carried out until acylation of the 23 hydroxyl group is substantially complete. It will be recognized by those in the art that the reaction time will vary depending upon the conditions used, especially upon the reactivity of the acylating agent and the temperature at which the reaction is conducted. Separation and purification of the desired 23 monoester derivatives of OMT or DMT are accomplished using procedures known in the art. Silica gel chroma tography is an especially useful technique for purifying the 23 monoesters of OMT and DMT. In order to illustrate more fully the opera tion of this invention, the following examples are provided Preparation 1Preparation of DMTA.
