# An acousto optically modulated scanning system.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an acousto optically modulated scanning system which includes means 8 for generating a beam of light, light deflecting means 16 intercepting light from said generating apparatus for scanning said raster substantially simultaneously in at least one pair of scan lines for creating said image display, acousto optical modulating means 12, 14 interposed between said light generating means 8 and said light deflecting means 16 for producing a plurality of individually modulatable scanning beams. The modulating means includes means 12 for propagating a pair of acoustic waves in directions substantially normal to the path of said beam of light but offset by the Bragg angle and also normal with respect to each other, and means 14 for individually modulating each of said waves in accordance with data representative of the image to be displayed.
