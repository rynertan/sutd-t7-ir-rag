# Decoder.

## Abstract
Decoder for converting information supplied in code about a compiled page into image formation which is fed in the form of a serial pixel bit flow to a raster output scanner, in which the raster output scanner is designed to form with the aid of a number of scanning lines an image on an im age forming medium, comprising a first memory for the storage of all items occurring on the compiled page togeth er with the m bits information relating to their position on that page, a second memory for the storage of the bit pat tern of all items occurring in the first memory, a third memo ry for the storage of the address information relating to the bit patterns in the second memory and for the storage of for mat information for items, means for converting data taken from these tables into n bits words for each scanning line, and at least on n bits wide pixel column memory.
