## Description
Morphine and related opioids produce their major effects on the central nervous system and bowel. The effects of these compounds are diverse and include analgesia, drowsiness, changes in mood, respiratory depression, decreased gastrointestinal motility, nausea, vomiting, and alterations of the endocrine and autonomic nervous systems. Much research in the field of opioid pharmacology has focused on the understanding of the molecular nature of the phenomena of tolerance and physical dependence attendant to prolonged medical treatment with these compounds as well as the non medical use thereof such as in compulsive drug use or compulsive drug abuse . Calcium has been hypothesized to play an important role in morphine induced analgesia possibly due to the ability of morphine to inhibit calcium movement in nerve terminals Kaimkubo et al, The present invention is directed to the use of an effective amount of a calcium channel blocking drug or a pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic salt thereof in the production of compositions for suppressing withdrawal symptoms in an opioid induced tolerant or physically dependent individual. Also disclosed are pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in suppressing withdrawal symptoms in an opioid induced tolerant or physically dependent individual containing an effective amount of a calcium channel blocking drug or a pharmaceutically acceptabel non toxic salt thereof in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic inert diluent or carrier. As described earlier, a common adjunct to the medical or non medical use of opioids is the induced tolerance and physical dependence which develops as a result of either controlled or indiscriminate use of these compounds. The development of tolerance and physical dependence with repeated use is characteristic of all opioids. Precise definitions for the terms tolerance and physical dependence are difficult to make owing to the vast amount of literature describing the medical and non medical i.e., abusive uses for the opioids and differing opinions of the writers as to what is to be circumscribed within the meaning of each term. Suffice it to say that for present purposes the term tolerance refers to a progressive diminution of susceptibility to the effects of an opioid resulting from its continued administration at a constant dose. Physical dependence refers to the perceived need developed by an individual for the continued administration of an opioid to prevent the development of the physiological disturbances known as abstinence syndrome or simply withdrawal. Similarly the term withdrawal is not susceptible of precise definition but may best be looked at in terms of the myriad symptoms accompanying abstinence from an opioid. Such symptoms include sympathetic effects such as lacrimation, rhinorrhea, sweating, piloerection, dilated pupils, elevated blood pressure and pulse rate as well as parasympathetic manifestations such as emesis, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Behavioral hyperexcitability may be observed in terms of anxiety, restlessness, yawning, tremor or insomnia and additionally muscle and joint pain will ensue. These definitions are provided as guides to an understanding of the discussions provided herein, recognizing that precise definitions are not critical to the method of the present invention and that differences of opinion may exist as to what is meant by each term. Jaffe and Martin in The calcium channel blocking drugs which may be used in the production of pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include the 1,4 dihydropyridines such as nitrendipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine and the like β phenethylamines such as tiapamil and verapamil benzothiazepines such as diltiazem ethylenediamines such as bepridil an diaryl alkyl amines such as lidoflazine, prenylamine, fendiline, terodiline, cinnarizine and flunarizine. Of the calcium channel blocking drugs which may be used in the present invention, the 1,4 dihydropyridines and the β phenethylamines are preferred. Of the 1,4 dihydropyridines, nisoldipine, nifedipine and nimodipine are particularly preferred for use in the method and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention. Nisoldipine is isobutyl methyl 1,4 dihydro 2,6 dimethyl 4 2 nitrophenyl 3,5 pyridinecarboxylate. Nifedipine is 3,5 pyridinecarboxylic acid 1,4 dihydro 2,6 dimethyl 4 2 nitrophenyl dimethyl ester. Nimodipine is 1,4 dihydro 2,6 dimethyl 4 3 nitrophenyl pyridine 3 β methyoxyethyl ester 5 isopropyl ester. Of the β phenethylamines, verapamil is particularly preferred for use in the method and pharamceutical compositions of the present invention. Verapamil is 5 3,4 dimethoxyphenethyl methylamino 2 3,4 dimethoxyphenyl 2 isopropylvaleronitrile. For purposes of the present invention an effective amount of a calcium channel blocking drug or a combination of one or more calcium channel blocking drugs is administered. As used herein, the term effective amount refers to that amount of one or a combination of one or more calcium channel blocking drugs necessary to suppress withdrawal symptoms in an opioid induced tolerant or physically dependent individual. The skilled artisan will readily appreciate that the effective dosage ranges for the various calcium channel blocking drugs used in the methods and compositions of the present invention will vary widely particularly where the route of administration and the precise drug to be used are considerations. Of course other factors such as the size and age of the patient as well as the time and frequency of administration are to be considered in determining the dose in a given situation. Suffice it to say that the precise dose to be administered in a particular case will be either readily known from the published literature or can be determined by conventional dose titration techniques. Typically though not necessarily the dosages may range anywhere from about 0.0001 milligram mg per kilogram kg of body weight per day to about 100 mg per kg of body weight per day. For example, for the specific compound nimodipine the dose for intravenous administration may fall anywhere within the range of from about 0.0001 mg per kg of body weight per day to about 0.5 mg per kg, preferably from about 0.001 to about 0.1 mg per kg of body weight per day. For oral administration the dose may fall anywhere within the range of from about 0.001 mg per kg of body weight per day to about 1 mg per kg of body weight per day, preferably from about 0.01 to about 0.5 mg per kg of body weight per day. The calcium channel blocking drug is administered internally in the form of a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more of said calcium channel blocking drugs or pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic salts thereof in admixture with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic diluents or carriers, i.e., a diluent or carrier which is chemically inert to the drug and which has no detrimental side effects or toxicity under the conditions of use. Internal administration of the compounds may be parenteral as for example by intraperitoneal, subcutaneous intramuscular or intravenous injection. Dosage forms for parenteral administration can be prepared by suspending or dissolving an amount of the calcium channel blocking drug in a non toxic liquid vehicle suitable for injection such as an aqueous or oleaginous medium and sterlizing the suspension or solution. Alternatively,a measured amount of the drug may be placed in a vial and the vial and its contents sterilized and sealed. An accompanying vial or vehicle can be provided for purposes of mixing prior to administration. Pharmaceutical compositions adapted for parenteral administration employ diluents and carriers such as water and water miscible organic solvents such as sesame oil, groundnut oil, aqueous propylene glycol and N,N dimethylformamide. Examples of such pharmaceutical compositions include sterile, isotonic, aqueous saline solutions of the calcium channel blocking drug which can be buffered with a pharmaceutically acceptable buffer and which are pyrogen free. Internal administration of the calcium channel blocking drug may also be accomplished by means of oral pharmaceutical dosage forms. These include any of the conventional solid or liquid dosage forms such as powders, tablets, capsules, suspensions, solutions, syrups and the like including any sustained release preparations of the above. Such oral pharmaceutical dosage forms employ such ingredients as diluents and carriers, excipients and lubricants such as glucose, lactose, sucrose, corn and potato starch, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, powdered gum tragacanth, gelatin, alginic acid, agar, stearic acid, sodium, calcium and magnesium stearates, sodium lauryl sulfate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate as well as various buffering agents, surfactants, emulsifiers, dispersing agents, flavoring agents and the like. Preparation of the pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be readily achieved by one skilled in the art. Further information pertinent to the preparation of such compositions may be obtained by reference to standard treatises such as The following examples are provided as a means of illustrating the present invention and are not to be construed as a limitation thereon. Male ICR mice were made tolerant to morphine by the subcutaneous implantation of a morphine pellet 75 mg, morphine base which was maintained in the animal for three days. These mice were then divided into two groups. One group was injected intraperitioneally with 16.6 mg kg of nisoldipine while the second group was maintained as a control no nisoldipine was administered . Withdrawal was precipitated in both groups of mice by the intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 mg kg of naloxone 15 minutes after nisoldipine administration. Naloxone is a narcotic antagonist capable of inducing withdrawal symptoms in opioid tolerant states. The naloxone withdrawal was evidenced by episodes of jumping and the number of jumps for each mouse in each group were determined for a five minute period. The group of mice pretreated with nisoldipine exhibited an approximately 61 percent decrease in naloxone precipitated jumping relative to the control group. Following substantially the same procedure as described in Example 1, three groups of morphine tolerant male ICR mice were pretreated with two different doses of nimodipine prior to administration of the naloxone. The nimodipine was found to inhibit the naloxone precipitated jumping by about 43 percent and 65 percent at doses of 5 and 10 mg kg of nimodipine, respectively percent inhibition all relative to control where no nimodipine was administered . Male Sprague Dawley rats were made morphine tolerant by chronic intraperitoneal injections of morphine as follows. On the first day, rats were given three 10 mg kg doses of morphine at four hour intervals. The dose of morphine was increased on successive days to 20 and 50 mg kg three times daily and then to 100 mg kg three times daily for two days and finally to 200 mg kg three times daily for one day. One group of these rats was then administered intraperitoneally 20 mg kg of nisoldipine and a second group was maintained as a control i.e., no nisoldipine was given . Fifteen minutes after the nisoldipine was administered, withdrawal was precipitated in each group by the intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 mg kg naloxone. Both groups of rats were then scored during the 30 minute period immediately following naloxone injection for withdrawal signs of abdominal stretching, diarrhea, wet dog shakes, teeth chattering, ptosis and weight loss. The results of this study are shown in Table I. The data shown in Table I clearly indicate that nisoldipine was effective in suppressing four out of the five withdrawal symptoms observed for those pretreated animals. The procedure set forth in Example 3 was repeated using nimodipine 10 mg kg rather than nisoldipine. The results are shown in Table II. The data shown in Table II clearly indicate that nimodipine was effective in suppressing four out of the five withdrawal symptoms observed for those pretreated animals. Two groups of rats were made tolerant to morphine as described in Example 3. A third nontolerant group was maintained as a control. Nifedipine 20 mg kg was administered intrapertioneally to one of the groups of morphine tolerant rats and 15 minutes later naloxone 1 mg kg was administered to all three groups of rats. Each group of rats was observed and evaluated for diarrhea and subsequent body weight loss associated with withdrawal. The group of morphine tolerant rats pretreated with nifedipine was found to show no weight loss relative to the nontolerant control for the three hour period immediately following naloxone injection. An approximately 10 percent weight loss relative to the nontolerant control was measured for the group of rats made tolerant but not pretreated with nifedipine. This same procedure was repeated using nimodipine 10 mg kg instead of nifedipine. The group of morphine tolerant rats pretreated with nimodipine was found to show an approximate 2 percent weight loss relative to the nontolerant control for the three hour period immediately following naloxone injection. An approximately 10 percent weight loss relative to the nontolerant control was measured for the group of rats made tolerant but not pretreated with nimodipine. The procedure set forth in Example 5 was repeated using verapamil 10 mg kg as the calcium channel blocking drug. The group of morphine tolerant rats pretreated with verapamil was found to show an approximate 3 percent weight loss relative to the nontolerant control for the three hour period immediately following naloxone injection. An approximately 10 percent weight loss relative to the nontolerant control was measured for the group of rats made tolerant but not pretreated with verapamil.
