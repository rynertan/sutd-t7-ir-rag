# Apparatus for and a method of measuring the thickness of a film.

## Abstract
Apparatus for and a method of measuring the thickness of a film are described. The apparatus comprises a light source 5 or 5a for illuminating a specimen 2 carrying a film. Light reflected from the specimen is incident on a diffraction grating spectrum provided by the grating 8 is received by a one dimensional array 16 of photosensitive elements. Parallel signals output by the array 16 are converted by a parallel to series conversion circuit 17 and an analogue to digital converter 18 into digital series signals which are processed by signal processing means 20 which then compares the received processed spectrum data with stored reference spectrum data determine the thickness of the film.
