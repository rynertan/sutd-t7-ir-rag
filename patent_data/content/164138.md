# Data processing system with a plurality of input output buses.

## Abstract
A CPU 10 communicates with various devices on a sys tem bus 11 and communicates with two further groups of devices by way of interfaces 14 and 14A and corresponding buses 15B and 15A whose timing and control character istics are different from each other and from those of the sys tem bus 11 . The interface 14 polls the device which may be on its bus 15B and keeps a record of the devices actually present. When access to a device is required, the interface 14 provides access via its bus 15B if the device is recorded as present on that bus. Otherwise it provides a signal to the inter face 14a to enable access via the corresponding bus 15A .
