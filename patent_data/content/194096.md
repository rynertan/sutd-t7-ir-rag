# Cleaved coupled cavity laser driven system for measuring small signals.

## Abstract
A laser driven interferometric signal sensing system has a cleaved coupled cavity laser 10 with separate stabilization servo loops 12 16, 20 29 of different time constants for the modulator 11 and laser 18 sections thereof. The laser sec tion is biased 14 above lasing threshold, and its stabilisation loop is operated at a frequency twice the frequency of laser section bias current modulation. A laser loop feedback error signal from 32 is a function of predetermined, environmental type, parameter variations in the sensing location and is processed 31, 32, 36 to be a function of the second deriva tive of intereferometer output intensity with respect to laser section current. That error signal is applied to modify 20 laser section bias current in a direction to zero out the feedback signal.
