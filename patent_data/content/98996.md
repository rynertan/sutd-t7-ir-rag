# Zirconium alloy having superior corrosion resistance.

## Abstract
A zirconium alloy having superior corrosion resistance, containing Sn of a small amount not less than the amount of Sn existing in the solid solution of the zirconium alloy at a room temperature, and at least one element chosen between Fe and Cr, each in a small amount not less than the amount of each of Fe and Cr existing in the solid solution of the zirconium alloy at room temperature, the total amount of Fe and Cr existing in the solid solution of the zirconium alloy being not less than 0.26 . the zirconium alloy being annealed after a solution heat treatment at a temperature at which both the α phase and β phase thereof are included in the zirconium alloy. Preferably, the alloy consists of 1 2 of Sn, at least one element selected from the group of 0,05 0,3 Fe, 0,05 0,2 Cr, 0 0,1 Ni, balance Zr.
