## Description
The present invention relates to an amorphous silicon semiconductor and an amorphous silicon photovoltaic device. Since it was found in 1976 by W.E. Spear et al that the conductivity of the amorphous silicon obtained by a plasma decomposition method of silane SiH₄ could be greatly altered by doping with phosphine PH₃ and diborane B₂H₆ and an amorphous silicon solar cell was fabricated on an experimental basis in 1976 by D. E. Carlson et al, the amorphous silicon solar cell has attracted attention and a study of improvement of its efficiency has been lively made. The Schottky barrier type, PIN type, MIS type and heterojunction type are known as structures of photovoltaic devices using an amorphous silicon thin film. The former three types promise to provide high efficient solar cells. For instance, a Schottky barrier type solar cell made by D. E. Carlson et al in 1977 showed a conversion efficiency of 5.5 , a MIS type solar cell made by J. I. B. Willson et al in 1978 showed a conversion efficiency of 4.8 , and a PIN junction solar cell made by Yoshihiro Hamakawa in 1978 showed a conversion efficiency of 4.5 . In case of the PIN junction solar cell, the P or N type amorphous silicon gives a short carrier life time and, therefore, fails to provide an effective cell. Also, the P layer suffers from heavy absorption loss of light because it has a higher light absorption coefficient than the I layer. In order to eliminate these drawbacks, an inverted PIN junction photovoltaic device has been proposed. This photovoltaic device is constructed so that the light impinges on the N type amorphous silicon side. Since this device has a smaller light absorption coefficient than the P type, it is believed to be more advantageous, though slightly. Nevertheless this N type amorphous silicon is no better than the P type in the sense that it similarly suffers from absorption loss of light. Amorphous silicon containing 5.10¹⁹cm ³ of carbon and 7.10¹⁸cm ³ of nitrogen used in a p i n solar cell is described in Extended Abstracts vol. 80 2 October 1970, Abstract No. 572, pages 1428 1429. Also, in case of the PIN junction solar cell, it is necessary to attach a transparent electrode onto the light impinging side, and ITO indium tin oxide In₂O₃ SnO₂ or SnO₂ has been employed as a transparent electrode. However, the ITO electrode has the disadvantage that the curve fill factor is good, but the open circuit voltage is low, and the SnO₂ electrode has the disadvantage that the open circuit voltage is high, but the curve fill factor is bad. It is an object of the present invention to provide an amorphous silicon semiconductor suitable for use in fabricating an amorphous silicon PIN junction photovoltaic device. Another object of the invention is to provide an amorphous silicon PIN junction photovoltaic device having an improved conversion efficiency. These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent from the description hereinafter. It has now been found that the short circuit current density and the open circuit voltage are greatly improved by using in at least one of the P and N layers of PIN junction photovoltaic device a P type or N type doped thin film of a hydrogenated amorphous silicon carbon nitride of the general formula a Si In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an amorphous silicon carbon nitride semiconductor according to claim 1. The present invention also provides an amorphous silicon PIN junction photovoltaic device according to claim 2. The photovoltaic device of the present invention is useful as solar cells, photoswitches, and the like. The term amorphous silicon as used herein means the hydrogenated ones or fluorinated ones, and comprehends amorphous silicon derivatives such as a SiGe H, a SiGe F H, a SiSn H, a SiSn F H, a SiSnGe H, a SiSnGe F H and so on. Amorphous silicon used in the present invention is obtained by subjecting a mixed gas containing a silicon compound, e.g. monosilane, a polysilane such as disilane, silane fluoride or a derivative thereof, or a mixture thereof, and hydrogen or an inert gas such as argon or helium diluted with hydrogen, and if necessary, further with GeH₄ and or SnH₄, to radio frequency glow decomposition or DC glow discharge decomposition by the capacitive or inductive coupling method. The concentration of silane in the mixed gas generally is in the range of from 0.5 to 100 . The concentration of the silane derivatives is suitably determined in accordance with the composition of the desired product and the glow discharge decomposition condition. A substrate is desired to have a working temperature in the range of from about 200 to about 300 C. The substrates used in the invention include a glass sheet having a transparent electrode e.g. ITO and SnO₂ vacuum deposited thereon, a metallized polymer film, a metal sheet and all other known materials used as substrates in the fabrication of a solar cell. Typical examples of the basic construction of a solar cell are shown in Figs. 1 a and 1 b . Illustrated in Fig. 1 a is a solar cell of the type that the light impinges on the P layer side. For instance, the solar cell of this type has a construction of glass transparent electrode P I N AI. Illustrated in Fig. 1 b is a solar cell of the type that the light impinges on the N layer side. For instance, the solar cell of this type has a construction of stainless steel P I N transparent electrode. Optionally, other constructions may be formed by interposing a thin insulation layer or a thin metal layer between the P layer or N layer and the transparent electrode. Any construction suffices so far as the PIN junction is included as the basic component. Intrinsic amorphous silicon hereinafter referred to as I type a Si obtained by the glow discharge decomposition of silane or a derivative thereof, silane fluoride or a derivative thereof, or a mixture thereof, and an amorphous silicon derivative such as a SiGe or a SiSn, which have a carrier life time of not less than about 10 ⁸ second, a density of localized state not more than about 10¹⁸cm³eV¹ and a mobility of not less than 10 ⁴cm² V sec, are employed in the present invention as an I layer of amorphous silicon derivative photovoltaic cells. The I type a Si and the amorphous silicon derivative may be employed alone or in combination thereof as an I layer. The PIN junction structure is formed by joining P type and N type doped amorphous silicon semiconductors to the I layer. The construction contemplated by the present invention is characterized by using, in at least one of the P layer and N layer, specifically in the layer on which the light impinges, a P or N type amorphous semiconductor of the general formula a Si The amorphous semiconductor of the present invention is made of amorphous silicon carbon nitride represented by the general formula a Si The amorphous silicon carbon nitride semiconductor of the present invention has a large optical band gap and exhibits a very high open circuit voltage Voc , though the semiconductor, when used as a window material for the PIN junction photovoltaic device, naturally has a possibility of increasing the shortcircuit current density Jsc . It has been found that in the photovoltaic device of the present invention, there is the correlation between the diffusion potential Vd and the open circuit voltage of the device as depicted by the band profile of Fig. 2. Although the diffusion potential Vd in the case of the invention exceeds about 1.1 volts, the trend of the relation is nearly constant without reference to the kind of the amorphous semiconductor to be used on the side exposed to the incident light. This diffusion potential is the difference obtained by subtracting the fermi level Ef of the P, N doped layers from the optical band gap Eg.opt of the amorphous semiconductor on the side exposed to the light. Let Ecn stand for the energy level of the conduction band on the N side and Evp for the energy level of the valence band on the P side, and the activation energies ΔEp and ΔEn can be determined based on the dependency of electric conductivity on temperature as shown in Fig. 2. Since ΔEp Ef Evp holds for the P type and ΔEn Ecn Ef for the N type, there ensues eVd Eg.opt ΔEp ΔEn . In the case of the incidence of light which occurs on the N side, the diffusion potential is similarly obtained by subtracting the fermi level Ef of the P, N layers from the optical band gap Eg.opt of the N type amorphous semiconductor. It is preferable that the amorphous semiconductor of the invention shown by the general formula a Si The PIN junction photovoltaic device provided by the present invention will be described specifically below. In one typical construction as shown in Fig. 1 a , this device is of the type that the light impinges on the P layer side, and is composed of substrate 1 such as glass, transparent electrode 2, P type amorphous semi conductor 3, I type amorphous silicon 4, N type amorphous semiconductor 5 and electrode 6. The amorphous silicon carbon nitride semiconductor of the present invention is used at least in the layer on which the light impinges, and for instance, the photovoltaic cell of the invention has a construction of transparent electrode P type a Si The P type a Si Although the thickness of the I type a Si layer is not specifically limited in the device of the present invention, it is generally selected from about 250 nm 2,500 Å to about 1,000 nm 10,000 Å . Also, the thickness of the N type a Si layer is not specifically limited, but is usually selected from about 15 nm 150 Å to about 60 nm 600 Å . Optionally, this N type a Si layer may be substituted by the N type a Si In another typical construction as shown in Fig. 1 b , the device is composed of electrode substrate 7, P type amorphous semiconductor 8, I type amorphous silicon 9, N type amorphous semiconductor 10 and transparent electrode 11, and the transparent electrode side is exposed to the light. The photovoltaic device of this type has a construction of transparent electrode N type a Si The present inventors have also found that the curve fill factor and open circuit voltage can be greatly improved by providing ITO SnO₂ layers as a transparent electrode on the light impinging layer of a PIN junction photovoltaic device so that the SnO₂ layer has a thickness of about 3 nm 30 Å to about 50 nm 500 Å , preferably about 5 nm 50 Å to 50 nm 500 Å , and comes into contact with the light impinging P or N layer. Accordingly, the present invention provides an amorphous silicon PIN junction photovoltaic device having a high conversion efficiency which is improved in that it has a structure of ITO SnO₂ P I N or ITO SnO₂ N I P and the thickness of the SnO₂ layer is from about 3 nm 30 Å to about 50 nm 500 Å . Typical examples of the basic structure of the photovoltaic device according to the present invention are shown in Figs. 4 a and 4 b . Illustrated in Fig. 4 a is a photovoltaic device of the type that the light impinges on the P layer side, and is composed of transparent substrate 21 such as glass, ITO film 23, SnO₂ film 23, P type amorphous silicon 24, intrinsic amorphous silicon 25, N type amorphous silicon 26 and electrode 27. For instance, the device of this type has a construction of glass ITO SnO₂ P I N AI. Illustrated in Fig. 4 b is a photovoltaic device of the type that the light impinges on the N layer side, and is composed of ITO film 28, SnO₂ film 29, N type amorphous silicon 30, intrinsic amorphous silicon 31, P type amorphous silicon 32 and electrode 33 such as metal. For instance, the device of this type has a construction of stainless steel P I N SnO₂ ITO. Other constructions may be formed, for instance, by interposing a thin insulation layer or a thin metal layer between the P layer or N layer and the transparent electrode layer. Any constructions are adoptable so far as the transparent electrode of the ITO SnO₂ two layer structure in which the SnO₂ layer has a thickness of about 3 nm 30 Å and about 50 nm 500 Å , is provided on the P layer or N layer to be exposed to the light to form an ITO SnO₂ P I N or ITO SnO₂ N I P structure. The above mentioned specific transparent electrode is applicable to the a Si PIN homojunction and heterojunction photovoltaic devices. The ITO film in the present invention is formed by subjecting In₂O₃ containing 3 to 15 by weight of SnO₂ to an electron beam deposition or sputtering method. The SnO₂ film in the present invention is usually those doped with a slight amount of Sb, and is formed by an electron beam deposition, sputtering or chemical vapor deposition method. In case of providing on a transparent substrate 1 such as glass as shown in Fig. 4 a , ITO is deposited on the substrate and SnO₂ is then deposited thereon in a film having a thickness of about 3 to about 50 nm. Although the thickness of the ITO film is not particularly limited, it is usually selected from 60 nm 600 Å to 400 nm 4,000 Å , especially from 60 nm 600 Å to 200 nm 2,000 Å . In case of employing a metal electrode 23 as shown in Fig. 4 b , after forming amorphous silicon semiconductors 32, 31 and 30 on the metal electrode 23, the SnO₂ film 29 having a thickness of 3 to 50 nm and the ITO film are formed thereon in that order. Further improved results are obtained in fabricating a PIN heterojunction photovoltaic device by employing the transparent electrode of the ITO SnO₂ two layer structure. In that case, an amorphous silicon semiconductor of the general formula a Si The present invention is more specifically described and explained by means of the following Example. Glow discharge decomposition was carried out at a radio frequency of 13.56 MHz in a quartz tube having an inner diameter of 11 cm. An I type a Si was obtained by subjecting silane diluted with hydrogen to the glow discharge decomposition at 2 to 10 Torrs. A N type a Si was obtained similarly by subjecting silane diluted with hydrogen and phosphine PH₃ PH₃ SiH₄ 0.5 mole to the glow discharge decomposition. A P type a Si A solar cell was constructed by successively depositing the P type a Si The characteristics of the obtained solar cells having a construction of glass SnO₂ P type a Si It is seen in Table 1 that the conversion efficiency which is 4.6 for the P layer made from silane alone i.e. P type a Si H is increased to 6.5 even when the values of x and y in the amorphous semiconductor a Si Substantially the same results were obtained when SiF₄, CH₄ and NH₃ were used instead. The optical energy gap Eg.opt of the a Si As described above, when the amorphous semiconductor having an Eg.opt of at least about 1.85 eV and a PIN junction diffusion potential Vd of at least 1.1 volts is employed as a window material of a heterojunction photovoltaic device, marked improvements are obtained in not only Jsc, but also Voc. The same result is obtained also in the case where the N type a Si
