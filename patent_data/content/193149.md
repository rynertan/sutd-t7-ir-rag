# Joint mechanism for manipulators.

## Abstract
A joint mechanism for a manipulator movable in the manner similar to human shoulder and elbow joints is dis closed. The joint mechanism comprises three actuators 50,60,70 mounted on a shoulder frame 20 , a first gear assembly 11,12,51 for moving the shoulder frame back and forth when the first actuator is driven, a second gear assem bly 61,32 for moving the upper and lower arms clockwise or counterclockwise when the second actuator is driven, and a third gear assembly 72,41 for moving only the lower arm back and forth or up and down when the third actuator is driven. Further, a balance weigth 31 and its gear assembly 37,73 are attached and driven by the third actuator to keep weight balance of the moved lower arm. A fourth actuator 80 and its gear assembly 81,82,83,11A are disclosed for further moving the shoulder frame right and left.
