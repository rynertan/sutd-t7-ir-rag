# Process for the production of dehydrated rice.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a process for the production of no cook dehydrated rice which can be rehydrated and rendered palatable in a few minutes by the addition of boiling water thereto. The process comprises soaking parboiled rice, cooking it, drying it to a moisture content of 2 20 by weight, and puffing the rice at a temperature in the range 150 350 C. In a preferred embodiment, the parboiled rice is soaked to a moisture content of about 50 , washed, drained, allowed to stand for at least 1 2 hour, cooked in dry steam, washed, cooled, dried to a moisture content around 10 , allowed to stand for at least 1 2 hour, and puffed in a stream of hot air for 13 20 seconds at 240 270 C.
