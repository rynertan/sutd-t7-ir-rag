# Low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamp.

## Abstract
A low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamp having a satisfactory colour rendition Ra 80 , a colour temperature of 2800 K or higher and a colour point on or near the Planckian lo cus. The lamp is provided with a luminescent layer 4 which comprises a. a luminescent rare earth metal metaborate activated by Ce and Mn and having a fundamental lattice Ln Mg,Zn,Cd B₅O₁₀, where Ln represents the elements Y, La and or Gd, which borate exhibits red Mn emission, b. a luminescent material activated by Tb³ and having green Tb³ emission, c. at least one luminescent halophosphate of the group which comprises the calcium halophosphates emitting white light, activated by Sb³ and Mn² and having a colour tempera ture of at least 2900 K and blue luminescing calcium halophos phate activated by Sb³ . The lamps yield a satisfactory rendition of deep red co lours R9 60 and have a high luminous flux and a high main tenance of the luminous flux during the life.
