## Description
DE CRII TION DIAPER COVER The present invention relates to a diaper cover comprising a rear and hip covering portion, a groin covering portion and an abdomen covering portion for securing a diaper about an infant. Known diaper covers, for instance those disclosed inJapanese Utility Model Application No. 37 1952 26,764 are fitted as follows the rear and hip covering portion is put under the infant when lying down, and extensions around the hips are interconnected to secure the hip covering portion in position thereafter, the abdomen and groin covering portions are wrapped round the infant and the abdomen covcring portion is connected to the hip covering porticn extensions One disadvantage of this diaper cover is that it is apt to cause a pain or discomfort to an infant by compression of the delicate abdomen upon connection of the abdomen covering portion. Another disadvantage is that it should be provided with an elastic cord, at the upper edge of the hip cover, so that the hip cover is complicated to manufacture. Finally, an active infant is rather likely to disengage the connection of the abdomen covering portion. The invention aims to provide a diaper cover which reduces these disadvantages. According to the present invention there is provided a diaper cover comprising a rear and hip covering porticn having a pair of extension with interengageable fastening members at their ends, and an abdomen covering porticn and a groin covering portion integral with the rear and hip covering portion, and being characterised by a pair of extensions, with second fastening members, extending from both sides of said abdomen, covering portion, and by fastening means provided on said rear and hip covering porticn to engage witli said second fastening members. With this invention, the abdomen covering portion is connected at the back of an infant, in order to reduce discomfort upon connecticn and to be more secure no elastic being required. Adjustment is possible to allow secure, but not uncomfortable fixing, while much of the protection afforded by the cover is of double thickness. The diaper cover of this invention is of simple construction, and can be readily fitted in an appropriately adjusted condition. The present invention will now be described in more detail by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure is a perspective view of a first embodiment of diaper cover according to the invention Figure 2 is a developed plan view of the diaper cover of Figure 1, Figure 3 is ,lillarl vlfw of the diaper cover ofFigure 1 when assembled as if around an infant, Figure 4 is a plan viCw of a second embodiment of diaper cover acc rdirig lo the invention and Figure 5 is a plan view of a third embodiment of diaper cover according to the invention. Referrirg now to the drawings, particularly Figures 1 and 2, a diaper cover 1 for securing a diaper about An infant generally comprises rear and hip covering portion 2, an abdomen covering portion 3 and a groin covering portion 4.

A pair of integral extensions 5,6 of substantially triangular shape, are provided on the sides of the rear and hip portion 2. In Figure 2, the border between the extensions 5,6 and portion 2 is indicated by a chain line.The extensions 5,6 may however be formed separately and sewn on the portion 2. The extensions 5,6 are of a length so as to be capable of being interconnected at the front of the infant. Fastening members 7,8 are provided on opposite surfaces of the extensions 5,6 to inter engage one another. As shown in Figur e 2, the fastening member 7 is inclined upwards to the left and is on the outer lower as shown surface of the extension 5 adjacent the free end tberof. The fastening member 8 is inclined upwards to the right and on the inner surface of the extension 6 adjacent the outer end thereof. The fastening members 7,8 can be interengaged to keep the hip cover 2 in position on an infant. As shown in Figure 2, the fastening member 7 is of elongate rectangular shape in order to allow adjustment of the tension obtained on securing about an infant. A pair of similar extensions 9,10 of substantially triangular shape are also provided on both sides of the abdomen covering portion 3 and these are provided with fastening members 11, 12 on their inner surfaces near their outer ends.
