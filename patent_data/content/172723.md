# Water soluble polymers.

## Abstract
A suspension may be flocculated using a water soluble substantially linear polymer having a single point intrinsic viscosity above 3 and that is a copolymer of two or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers including at least 0.5 by weight of monomer carrying pendant hydrophobic groups. The cationic polymers are novel. Preferred polymers are those in which the hydrophobic group is introduced as an allyl ether.
