# Tin phosphorus oxyfluoride glass containing aromatic organic compounds.

## Abstract
A tin phosphorous oxyfluoride glass in the Sn P O F composition field is used as a supporting matrix for light responsive polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as triplet state or lasing dyes thus providing a glass article containing at least one dissolved polycyclic aromatic hydro carbon compound which exhibits a response to light or an electric field. Dye compatability with the glass is good, as evidenced by the fact that glasses containing the dyes exhibit luminescence characteristic of the dissolved dye in a rigid solvent. The aromatic hydrocarbon compound is present in a concentration of up to 1 .
