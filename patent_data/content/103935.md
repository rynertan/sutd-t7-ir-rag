# Method and device for balancing circular plate shaped objects.

## Abstract
A method and a device for balancing circular plate shaped objects, in which the object 8 is centered on means 7 which are movable against spring force 6 . The object is then clamped 1, 10 against a rotatable part 1 which is rotated at a given speed. The object 8 is then released, whereupon it undergoes a deviation from the axis of rotation which is proportional to the unbalance. Subsequently, the object is clamped again and the outer edge is turned to remove the unbalance.
