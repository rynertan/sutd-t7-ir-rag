## Description
BIS AMINOMETHYL BICYCLO 2 .2. 1 HEPTANES USEFUL AS METAL ION CONTROL AGENTS AND RADIOACTIVE METALS COMPLEXED THEREWITH Norbornane is a cyclic compound found in or derivable from the residual heavy hydrocarbons in the bottoms of distillation towers in light hydrocarbon production facilities. Various derivatives of norbornane have been made, among them the bis methylamine . It is this compound which has been phosphonomethylated which is the subject of the present invention. It is well known that amines such as ethylenediamine and diethylenetriamine can be reacted with formaldehyde and phosphorus acid to obtain methylene phosphonate derivatives of the amine in which the methylene phosphonate groupEMI1.1 substitutes for the amine hydrogens US 3,288,846 . The use of methylenephosphonic acid substituted alkylene polyamines for metal ion control at less than stoichiometric amounts was suggested in a patent US 2,609,390 issued in 1952. Later a water dispersible polymeric amine chelating agent which included alkylene phosphonate derivatives was indicated as having threshold effects in scale inhibition applications see US 3,331,773 , this term being used to describe the use of the agent in less than stoichiometric amounts. The diamine and polyamine metlenephosphonate derivatives are taught and claimed in US 3,336,221 and 3,434,969, respectively. Some of the products disclosed in these two patents are available commercially and are recommended as scale inhibitors when applied in threshold amounts. Other patents which disclose heterocyclic nitrogen containing compounds which are useful as chelating agents and may be employed in threshold amounts are US 3,674,804 3,720,498 3,743,603 3,859,211 and 3,954,761. Some of the compounds included therein are heterocyclic compounds having the formulas EMI2.1 wherein R is hydrogen or alkyl and M is hydrogen, alkali metal, ammonium or a di or triethanolamine radical EMI3.1 Certain phosphonic acid derivatives of the aliphatic acids can be prepared by reacting phosphorous acid with acid anhydrides or acid chlorides, e.g., the anhydrides or chlorides of acetic, propionic and valeric acids. The compounds prepared have the formulaEMI3.2 wherein R is a lower alkyl radical having 1 to 5 carbon atoms. The method of making and use of these products is described in US 3,214,454.The use of threshold amounts to prevent calcium precipitation is disclosed and claimed therein. It has now been discovered that new chelating and threshold agents for inhibiting precipitation of metal ions can be made from the bis methylamine derivatives of norbornane. This compound has the structureEMI4.1 This compound is also known by the more formal name of 2 3 ,5 6 bis aminomethyl bicyclo 2,2,l heptane. Its derivatives are those with various substituents replacing the primary amine hydrogens. A new class of compounds is formed when norbornane bis methylamine is reacted with certain compounds, e.g., formaldehyde and phosphorous acid will form methylenephosphonic acid derivatives.These new compounds have the structureEMI4.2 Formula I wherein substituents A, B, X and Y each are independently selected from radicals consisting of hydrogen, hydroxyalkyl wherein the alkyl group contains 2 6 carbon atoms , methylenephosphonic, methylene , ethylene and propylenesulfonic, carboxylic acid radicals having 2 4 carbon atoms and the alkali or alkaline earth metal, ammonia and amine salts of any of the phosphonic, sulfonic or carboxylic acid derivatives. At least one of the substituents must be other than a hydrogen. Methods for obtaining hydroxyalkyl, sulfonic acid or carboxylic acid derivatives of compounds of Formula I are well known in the art. The method for substituting a hydrogen of an amine with a hydroxyalkyl group by reacting with an epoxide, e.g., ethylene or propylene oxide, is taught in US 3,398,198. The sulfonic acid radical can be substituted for an amine hydrogen by reacting the amine with a mixture of sodium bisulfite and formaldehyde to obtain a methylenesulfonic acid group substituent on the nitrogen of the amine compound. This reaction is taught in Preparation and Properties of Aminomethylenesulfonic Acids , J. Am. Chem. Soc., 77, 5512 15 1955 . Other alkylsulfonic acid derivatives can be made by reacting the amine with chloroalkylsulfonic acids. The 2 hydroxypropylsulfonic acid group may be substituted for an amine hydrogen by reacting the amine in aqueous solution with 3 chloro 2 hydroxy l propanesulfonic acid in the presence of caustic NaOH . The hydroxypropylsodiumsulfonate group is the nitrogen substituent. If the acid is desired, acidification with a strong acid, e.g., HC1 is sufficient to convert the sodium salt to the acid. This reaction is taught in US 3,091,522. The carboxylic acid group may be substituted for an amine hydrogen by reacting the amine in aqueous solution with appropriate nitrile such as glycolonitrile and acrylonitrile in the presence of excess caustic NaOH and then converting the salt form of the acid radical into the free carboxylic acid radical according to the well known procedure. With respect to the making of amine salts of the acid radicals, the reaction is well known. In Richterts 3rd edition 1952 of hisTextbook of Organic Chemistry, page 246, it is stated Amines of all classes, like ammonia, are basic substances and readily react with acids to form ionizable salts. The present invention also concerns the use of bis aminomethyl bicyclo 2.2.l heptanes ofFormula I as complexing agents for radionuclides for imaging the skeletal system of animals. The first radionuclide to be widely used for bone scanning was Sr 85. Strontium 85 is rapidly accuK ated by bone after intravenous administration and images of the skeletal system are possible. However, Sr 85 has a long physical half life 65 days and a long biological half life 800 days which limits the levels which can be administered. Also, the high energy of the gamma photon emitted 514 kev is difficult to collimate. Fluorine 18 has also been used to image the skeletal system. It is a positron emitter with a half life of 1.85 hr. Although F 18 has good physical properties for imaging, it has some serious drawbacks. Fluorine 18 is cyclotron produced and, therefore, expensive. Also its distribution is limited due to its short half life. Many organ scanning agents, including those for the skeletal system, have now been replaced with complexes of Technetium 99m. This nuclide has ideal physical properties T 6 hr, gamma photon of 141 kev for imaging. In addition, it is readily available because of the Mo 99 Tc 99m generators. Thus, the majority of imaging is now done using Tc 99m. Technetium 99m is obtained from generators in the 7 oxidation state as the pertechnetate ion Tc04 . In order to form a complex, Tc must be in a lower oxidation state, i.e., 3, 4, or 5. Although other reducing agents can be used,Sn2 has been employed most often. Thus Tc 99m complexes can be formed by reduction of TcO4 using Sn2 in the presence of a complexing agent. This is usually done in an aqueous saline solution that is suitable for intravenous injection. Commercial complexing agents are sold as radiopharmaceutical kits . A kit consists of an evacuated vial containing the complexing agent, a reducing agent, and possibly a buffer and stabilizers. To prepare the Tc 99m complexes, a few milliliters of sodium pertechnetate solution in saline is injected into the vial. An adequate amount of the resultant solution is used for imaging. Subramanion et al. Radiology, Vol. 99, pages 192 196, 1971 reported the use of a complex of Tc 99m and an inorganic polyphosphate for skeletal imaging. Several others have reported inorganic polyphosphates as useful for this purpose see US 3,852,414 4,016,249 and 4,082,840 . The use of pyrophosphate PYP for bone imaging has also been taught US 3,851,044 3,931,396 and 4,075,314 . The Tc phosphates had fair success but have been replaced by Tc phosphonates. Complexes of Tc 99m with phosphonic acids show higher bone uptake with faster blood clearance than Tc 99m phosphate complexes. Phosphonic acids which are considered the best bone scanning agents when complexed with Tc 99m include hydroxyethanediphosphonate EIIDP , methylenediphos phonate MDP and hydroxymethlenediphosphonate see US 3,983,227 3,989,730 4,032,625 and alsoJ. Nucl. Med., 21, page 767, Radiology 136, page 209 J Nucl. Med., 21, page 961 Radiology 136, page 747 . New stable complexing agents for Tc 99m which are derivatives of bicyclo 2.2.l heptane bis methylamines have been found which are useful in imaging the skeletal system in animals. These new complexing agents are represented by Formula I above. The complexes readily and efficiently clear through the kidneys with large amounts being taken up in the bone. The ratio of uptake in bone to that in soft tissue is high. The new complexing agents were found to form stable Tc 99m complexes when Sn2 was added to a saline solution containing the complexing agent.The complex clears readily through the kidneys with a large amount being taken up by the skeletal system and very little was left in the blood and soft tissue. Therefore, since the ratio of uptake in bone to that of surrounding soft tissue is high, the images were sharp and clear. Ratios of activity in bone soft tissue and bonefblood compare favorably to commercial Tc bone radiopharmaceuticals. The following examples illustrate the preparation and use of the new compounds of the invention. Identification of the compounds is made by reference to the above Formula I.Example 1 Distilled water 10 g and H3PO3 9.9 g were weighed into a 50 ml round bottom flask equipped with a water cooled condenser, a thermometer, a stirring bar, and an addition funnel. Concentrated HC1 11.8 g was then added and 3.9 g of 2 3 ,5 6 bis aminomethyl bicyclo 2,2, I heptane was slowly added while stirring. The solution was heated at reflux for approximately one hour and a 37 percent aqueous formaldehyde solution 8.51 g was added over a period of 2.5 hours. The solution was heated for an additional 3 hours at reflux. The compound formed was the completely phosphonomethylated norbornane derivative wherein each of A, B, X and Y were methylenephosphoric acid groups, CH2PO3H2. Example 2 The procedure for Example 1 was followed for the addition of 3 mole equivalents of formaldehyde 24.3 g of a 37 percent solution and phosphorous acid 25.1 g to one mole equivalent of 2 3 ,5 6 bis aminomethylibicyclo 2,2,l heptane 15.2 g . The resultant solution was neutralized with NaOH ag and one mole equivalent of glycolonitrile 14.7 g of a 38 percent solution and NaOH 13.8 g of a 33.3 percent solution was added. The compound formed was the sodium salt of the bicycloheptane derivative which had an average of three methylenephosphonic acid groups and one carboxymethyl group per molecule as the A, B, X and Y substituents.Example 3 A quantity 15.2 g, 0.1 mole of 1 2 ,4 5 bis aminomethyljbicyclo 2 2, 1 heptane was placed into a stainless steel beaker and 50 ml of distilled water was added, followed by the addition 37 ml of 50 percent NaOH. This solution was heated to about 700C with stirring and carboxymethylation accomplished by adding dropwise 58.9 g of 38 percent glycolonitrile while still heating, over a one hour period. After about 15 minutes of the addition, the temperature was at reflux and NH, was being liberated. Distilled water was added periodically to replace the evaporated water. After completing the addition of glycolonitrile, the solution was heated for an additional hour while stirring and purging with N2. The compound formed was the tetracarboxymethyl derivative wherein A, B,X and Y were CH2 COONa. The utility of the compounds of the invention was ascertained by conducting scale inhibition tests according to National Association ofCorrosion Engineers NACA test method TM 03 74.The calcium carbonate scale inhibition results are shown in Table I and compared with a commercially available scale inhibitor, aminotri methylenephosphonic acid . Calcium sulfate scale inhibition was also tested and results are shown in Table II.

This compound can function as either a threshold compound or a chelating agent. It should be recognized that the compounds of the invention can have several different groups as the A, B, X and Y substituents on the same molecule, but that when mixed derivatives are obtained, it is not usually possible to direct or predict which amine hydrogens are substituted. The product, in all probability, contains a mixture of isomeric compounds. While all of the compounds will chelate metal ions, only those which contain at least one methylenephosphonic acid group or its salt will pro vide a threshold effect.Example 4 One hundred p1 of the solution prepared in Example 1 was placed in a vial and one ml of 0.9 percent saline ag was added. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 3.5 using dilute NaOH and HC1 and 0.1 ml of a freshly eluted TcO4 solution was added. This was followed by the addition of 100 p1 of a saturated stannous tartrate solution. Elution of paper chromatography strips with saline and acetone showed less than 5 percent of the activity as Tc04 or reduced uncomplexed Tc. The above Tc complex 50 trl, slmCi was injected in the tail vein of rats. Scintillation scans of the anesthetized rats were taken at several intervals post injection. The bone scans were of high quality implying the use of this as a tool for human patients.Example 5 The Tc complex prepared in Example 4 50 p1, lmCi was injected in the tail vein of mice.The mice were killed at different times post injection, the organs and tissues removed, and the radiation measured with a Nal counter. The activity was found primarily in the bone, and bladder with no other organs showing a high affinity for the complex. At 120 minutes post injection, the bone, muscle, and liver had, respectively, 5.1, 0.01, and 0.24 percent dose g of the activity.Example 6 The Tc complex of Example 4 50 lmCi was injected into the tail vein of a series of rats.The animals were killed after 2 hours and the radiation from several tissues was quantitated using a Nal scintillation counter. Table III below shows the results compared to Tc MDP methylenediphosphonate , commercial Tc bone agent, evaluated in an identical manner.
