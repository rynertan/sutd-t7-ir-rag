# OPTICAL SHAFT ENCODER

## Abstract
An optical shaft encoder includes an optical shutter mounted to a shaft, the shutter bearing light transmissive and light reflective areas, at least a first light emitter and a first light detector arranged adjacent one another on one side of the optical shutter, and at leat a second light emitter and a second light detector arranged adjacent one another on a second side of the optical shutter and opposite the first light emitter and first light detector. The optical shutter comprises a disk or drum having the reflective and transmissive areas arranged in a predetermined pattern on its surface. The light emitters are alternately energized and the outputs of the two light detectors, which are dependent on the arrangement of reflective and transmissive areas of the optical shutter, are then detected and compared with a predetermined pattern of such outputs representative of the various angular positions the optical shutter and shaft can take. With this arrangement up to 16 different output states are possible. This enables the optical shutter to resolve 1 16 of a revolution of its associated shaft which is more than adequate for detecting the shaft position of a clock dial type register display of a gas, water or electric meter.
