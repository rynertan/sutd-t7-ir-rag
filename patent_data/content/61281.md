## Description
BIS ESTERS OF METHANEDIOL WITH ACETONIDES OF AMP IC ILLIN OR MOXICILLIN AND PENICILLANIC ACID 1,1 DIOXIDE This invention relates to bis esters of methanediol wherein one of the hydroxy groups of the methanediol is esterified with hetacillin or the hydroxy analog thereof , and the other hydroxy group of the methanediol is esterified with penicillanic acid l,l dioxide. These compounds have particular value in mammals as oral antibacterial agents against penicillinase producing bacteria. They are efficiently absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. After absorption they are transformed, providing unusually long lasting serum levels of ampicillin amoxicillin and penicillanic acid l,l dioxide. By its penicillinase inhibitory activity, the latter enhances the activity of the former against penicillinase producing bacteria. The present compounds are acetonide derivatives of compounds earlier described in British Patent Appli caution 2,044,255 and U.S. Patent 4,244,951. Unex pectedly the present compounds show a gredtly increased pectedly the present compounds show a greatly increased serum acid half life of ampicillin amoxicillin and peni cillanic acid 1,1 dioxide in comparison to the parent compounds and the disclosed in these references. Hetacillin and the hydroxy analog thereof have been described in the literature Eandcastle et al., J. Org. Chem. 31, pp. 897 899 1966 Long et al., J.Chem. Soc. C pp. 1920 1922 1971 . Esters of hetacillin and of the p hydroxy analog thereof have also been vow reported as especially usable for oral administration von Daehne, U.S. Patent 3,954,735, see alsoSleezer et are U.S. Patent 4,185,015 , but these compounds are not known to be beta lactamase inhibitors. This invention relates to systemic broad spectrum antibacterial agents of the formulaEMI2.1 and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof, wherein Y is H or OH and the imidazolidinone side chain is derived from the D form of alpha amino phenylacetic acid. When Y is H, the compound is the bis ester of hetacillin acetonide of ampicillin and penicillanic acid l,l dioxide with methanediol. WhenY is OR, the compound is the bis ester of the acetonide of amoxicillin and penicillanic acid l,l dioxide. The expression pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts is intended to encompass such acids as hydrocholoric, sulfuric phosphoric, maleic, succinic, citric, methanesulfonic, p toluenesulfonic, etc. The imidazolidinone compounds of the present invention are readily prepared by a number of alternative methods. The preferred method is as follows EMI3.1 Compounds of the formula II are simply allowed to stand in acetone until the reaction is substantially complete, and the excess acetone is removed by evaporation. As the source of the acetone bridge, an acetone ketal e.g. 2,2 dimethoxypropane or an enol ether or ester derivative of acetone e.gX 2 methoxypropene or 2 acetoxypropene can be used, provided an acid catalyst is present. Temperature is not critical, 0 50 C. being fully satisfactory conveniently, ambient temperatures can be used. In a second method, the compounds of formula I are prepared by reacting a carboxylate salt of the formulaEMI4.1 with a compound of the formulaEMI4.2 wherein Y is as previously defined, M is a carboxylate salt forming cation, and X is a good leaving group, for example, chloro, bromo, dodo, C1 C4 alkylsulfonyloxy, benzenesulfonyloxy or toluenesulfonyloxy. A variety of cations can be used to form the carboxylate salt in the compound of formula III, but salts which are commonly used include alkali metal salts, such as sodium and potassium salts alkaline earth metal salts, such as calcium and barium salts tertiary amine salts, such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, tributylamine, diisopropylethylamine, N methylmorpholine, N methylpiperidine, N methylpyrrolidine, N,N dimethylpiperazine and 1,2,3,4 tetrahydroquinoline, The reaction between a compound of formula III and a compound of formula IV is usually carried out by contacting the reagents in a polar, organic solvent, at a temperature in the range from about 0 to about 800C., and preferably from 250 to 500 C. The compounds of formula III and IV are usually contacted in substantially equimolar proportions, but an excess of either reagent, for example up to a ten fold excess, can be used. A wide variety of solvents can be used, but it is usually advantageous to use a relatively polar solvent, since this has the effect of speeding up the reaction.Solvents, such as water or methanol, which can solvolyze the acetonide group are preferably avoided. Typical solvents which can be used include N,N dimethylformamide,N,N dimethylacetamide, N methylpyrrolidone, dimethylsulfoxide, hexamethylphosphoramide and acetone. The latter is the preferred solvent when a quaternary ammonium salt is used in the preparation of the present compounds. The reaction time varies according to a number of factors, but at about 250C. reaction times of several hours, e.g. 12 to 24 hours, are commonly used.When X is chloro or bromo, it is sometimes advantageous to add up to about one molar equivalent of an alkali metal iodide, which has the effect of speeding up the reaction. The compound of formula I is isolated in conventional fashion. When a water miscible solvent is used, it is usually sufficient simply to dilute the reaction medium with a water immiscible solvent. The diluted reaction mixture is extracted with brine and with water, dried, and the product recovered by solvent evaporation. When a water immiscible solvent is used, it is usually sufficient to omit the dilution step. A variation of the foregoing method of preparing a compound of formula I involves reaction of a compound of the formulaEMI6.1 with a compound of the formulaEMI6.2 wherein M and X are as defined previously The reaction conditions for the reaction of V and VI are as described above for the reaction of III and IV . The compounds of formula III are known antibiotics, which are prepared by the published procedures. The compounds of formula IV are prepared from the compounds of formula V by reaction with a compound of formula X CH2 X , wherein X and X are each good leaving groups, e.g. chloro, bromo, iodo, alkylsulfonyloxy, benenesulfonyloxy, toluenesulfonyloxy ot chlorosulfonyloxy. The same conditions that were described previously for reaction of a compound of formula III with a compound of formula V are used for this reaction, except that it is preferable to use an excess of the compound of formula X CH2 X e.g. a four fold excess . In like manner, the compounds of formula VI are prepared by reaction of a compound of formula III with a compound of formula X CE2 X , wherein X and X are as previously defined. The conditions used are the same as those described previously for reaction of a compound of formula V with a compound of formula X CH2 X . The compounds of the present invention formulaI are hydrolyzed in aqueous systems to compounds of the formula II. Thus, the alternative routes to formula I compounds described above also provide an alternative synthetic route to the compounds of the formula II. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the present invention are prepared by reaction of the free base form with a molar equivalent of the acid, such as those defined above, in a reaction inert solvent i.e. one which will not lead to hydrolysis or solvolysis of either the acetonide or the methanediol bis ester . Acetone is particularly well suited as solvent ,for this purpose.When the salt does not precipitate directly, it is isolated by concentration and or the addition of a nonsolvent such as hexane or ether. The compounds of formula I possess in vivo antibacterial activity in mammals, and this activity can be demonstrated by standard techniques for penicillin compounds. For example, the compound of formula I is administered to mice in which acute infections have been established by intraperitoneal inoculation with a standardized culture of pathogenic bacterium. Infection severity is standardized such that the mice receive one to ten times the LDlQo 00 the minimum inoculation required to consistently kill 100 percent of control mice. At the end of the test, the activity of the compound is assessed hy counting the number of survivors which have been challenged by the bacterium and also have received the compound of formula I.The compounds of formula I can be administered by both the oral p.o. and subcutaneous s.c. route. The in vivo activity of the antibacterial compounds of this invention makes them suitable for the control of bacterial infections in mammals, including man, by both the oral and parenteral modes of administration. The compounds are useful in the control of infections caused by susceptible bacterial in human subjects. A compound of formula I breaks down into ampicillin or amoxicillin and penicillanic acid 1,1dioxide after administration to a mammalian subject by both the oral and parenteral route. Penicillanic acid l,l dioXide then functions as a beta lactamase inhibi tor and it increases the antibacterial effectiveness of the ampicillin or amoxicillin , for example, against penicillinase producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli. In determining whether a particular strain ofStaphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli is sensitive to a compound of the formula I, the in vivo test described earlier can be used. Alternatively, the minimum inhibitory concentration MIC of a 1 1 mixture of ampicillin or amoxicillin and penicillanic acid l,l dioxide can be measured. The MIC s can be measured by the procedure recommended by the International Collaborative Study on Antibiotic SensitivityTesting Ericcson and Sherris, Acta Pathologica etMicrobiologia Scandinav, Supp. 217, Section B 64 68 19711 , which employes brain heart infusion BHI agar and the inocula replicating device.Overnight growth tubes are diluted 100 fold for use as the standard inoculum 20,000 10,000 cells in approximately 0.002 ml. are placed on the agar surface 20 ml. of,BRI agar dish . Twelve 2 fold dilutions of the test compound are employed, with initial concentration of the test drug being 200 mcg. ml. Single colonies are disregarded when reading plates after 18 hrs. at 370C. The susceptibi lity MIC of the test organism is accepted as the lowest concentration of compound capable of producing complete inhibition of growth as judged by the naked eye. Since the object of the present invention is to provide a single well absorbed source of ampicillin amoxicillin and penicillanic acid l,l dioxide in serum, the compounds of the present invention are also evaluated by determination of the serum levels of these derived compounds in experimental animals, such as laboratory rats. The serum level results in fasted rats following the oral administration of 20 mg. kg.of 6 2,2 dimethyl 4 phenyl 5 imidazolidinon 1 yl penicillanoyloxymethyl penicillanate l,l dioxide I, H are shown in Table I. In this test, 6 2 amino2 phenylacetamido penicillanoyloxymethyl penicillanate l,l dioxide II, Y H at the same oral dosage has been used as control. The blood level of ampicillin was determined by standard plate bioassay methods, usingSarcina lutea 07A001 on Seed agar. For determination of penicillanic acid l,l dioxide, Pasturella 59B010 on MH agar was employed. It will be noted there is an approximately 50 improvement in the half life ofCompound I Y E over Compound II Y E .

Said carrier or diluent is chosen on the basis of the intended mode of administration. For example, when considering the preferred oral mode of administration, an antibacterial compound of this invention can be used in the form of tablets, capsules, lozenges, troches, powders, syrups, elixirs, aqueous solutions and suspensions, and the like, in accordance with standard pharma ceuticdl practice. The proportional ratio of active ingredient to carrier will naturally depend on the chemical nature, solubility and stability of the active ingredient, as well as the dosage contemplated.In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers which are commonly used include lactose, sodium citrate and salts of phosphoric acid. Various disintegrants such as starch, and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc, are commonly used in tablets. For oral administration in capsule form, useful diiuents are lactose and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols, e.g. polyethylene glycols having molecular weights of from 2000 to 4000. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening and or flavoring agents can be added. As indicated earlier, the antibacterial compounds of this invention are of use in human subjects and the daily dosages to be used will not differ significantly from other, clinically used, penicillin antibiotics.The prescribing physician will ultimately determine the appropriate dose for a given human subject, and this can be expected to vary according to the age, weight, and response of the individual patient as well as the nature and the severity of the patient s symptoms. The compounds of this invention will normally be used orally and parenterally at dosages in the range from about 5 to about 100 mg. per kilogram of body weight per day, usually in divided doses. In some instances it may be necessary to use doses outside these ranges. The present invention is illustrated by the following example. However, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific details of this example.
