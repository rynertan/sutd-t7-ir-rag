# Injection blow molding process.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for injection blow molding hollow plastic articles characterized by a rapid and efficient operating cycle. The injection mold includes a mold cavity and the blow mold is located adjacent the mold cavity in side by side relationship. The parison is injection molded into the mold cavity onto a core. The parison on the core is separated from the mold cavity by moving the parison on the core axially in a straight path away from the mold cavity, followed by movement in a substantially arcuate path into axial alignment with the blow mold, followed by axial movement in a straight path into said blow mold.
