# Method of making a gasket.

## Abstract
A method of making a gasket by pressing particles of expanded graphite in a mould onto the opposed faces of an apertured reinforcement plate to compact the particles and unite them with the plate makes use of a mould assembly comprising a base plate, first and second moulding rings, and a moulding punch which is apertured to conform with the apertures of the reinforcement plate. The first and second moulding rings are positionable above the base plate to form lower and upper mould recesses, into which expanded graphite is successively charged, so enclosing the apertured reinforcement plate. The punch is then operated to compact the graphite particles and unite them with the reinforcement plate. Compaction in the mould assembly can produce either the finished gasket or at least a composite whose graphite layers are firm enough to be handled outside the mould assembly to permit further compaction. The method is specially applicable to the manufacture of cylinder head gaskets for internal combustion engines.

## Description
Method of making a gasketThis invention relates to a method of making a gasket, more particularly a gasket of the kind comprising graphite foils with a reinforcement plate between them.In UK patent application 2 088 491A there is described a method of making such a gasket for automotive and petrochemical applications which entails among other things pressing particles of expanded graphite in a mould onto the opposed faces of an apertured reinforcement plate to compact the particles and unite them into foils which adhere to the plate. The method as described in the citation avoids the excessive waste of graphite that results when cutting foils from sheets of compressed expanded graphite, but does not give good results when applied to the manufacture of gaskets which have a relatively narrow area or land bridging adjacent apertures, as in a gasket for the cylinder head of an internal combustion engine. What happens is that the land becomes formed with too low a density to have adequate strength or sealing capacity. The method of the invention makes use of a mould assembly comprising a base plate, first and second moulding rings, and a moulding punch which is apertured to conform with the apertures of the gasket reinforcement plate, the assembly being used as follows I the first ring is positioned to surround the base plate and form with it a lower mould recess II expanded graphite particles are charged to the recess to present a level surface to the reinforcement plate III the apertured reinforcement plate is laid on the level surface of the charge IV the second ring is positioned above the first to form an upper mould recess V expanded graphite particles are charged to the upper recess to cover the reinforcement plate and present a level surface to the moulding punch VI the moulding punch is operated to compact the graphite particles and unite them to the plate.The expanded graphite particles employed suitably have a density in the range 4 40 kg m3. The graphite foils forming part of the finished gasket will usually have a density which is in the range 800 1600 kg m3. The finished density need not be achieved in step VI , whose purpose is primarily to produce a composite whose graphite layers are firm enough to withstand handling during and after removal from the mould assembly. Ordinarily this is achieved by compaction in the mould assembly to a density of 400 kg m3 or more.Compaction of the graphite to the finished density is preferably carried out outside the mould assembly, for example by passing the composite between compressor rollers.With a reinforcement plate that is smooth faced, it will usually be necessary to pre coat the plate with adhesive before laying it on the charge of expanded graphite.The uncompacted graphite, such as that which remains in the apertures of the moulding punch, can of course be employed in subsequent moulding operations.If it is desired to form a gasket whose graphite faces, although flat, have regions of different density, sections of the base plate and punch of the mould can have cavities formed by spring loaded inserts in appropriate regions to produce that result.The invention will now be further described with reference to the accompanying drawing, which is a view in perspective of a mould assembly suitable for the production of a gasket for the cylinder head of a 4 cylinder internal combustion engine.The mould assembly comprises a base plate 1, first and second moulding rings 3 and 5 and a moulding punch 7 apertured as at 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 to conform with apertures 9a etc. in the smooth surfaced metal plate A which is to be the reinforcement of the finished gasket, these apertures 9a 13a being respectively for cylinder bores, push rods, oil, water and bolts. In a typical prdcedure, the first ring 3 is lowered to surround the base plate 1 and form with it a lower mould recess, into which expanded graphite of density 25 kg m3 is poured. The surface of the graphite charge is then made level, by use of a rake, brushes or doctor blade, to give a uniform depth of say 15mm froa the upper surface of ring 3 to the upper surfacefbase plate 1. The reinforcement plate A, coated on each side with adhesive, is then laid on the level surface of the graphite charge, and the second moulding ring 5 is lowered to rest on the first ring 3 and form an upper mould recess. Expanded graphite is then poured into the upper recess to cover the plate A to a depth of about 15mm, and this second charge of graphite is made level with the upper face of ring 5.Rings 3 and 5 are selected to have a thickness corresponding to the desired depths of graphite charge below and above the reinforcement plate. The internal surfaces of rings 3 and 5 constitute the side walls of a mould whose base is formed by base plate 1 and whose roof is formed by moulding punch 7, which is operated to compact the expanded graphite particles in the mould to a density of 700 800 kg m3 and unite them to the plate, forming a composite of plate and adherent layers of compacted graphite. After withdrawal of punch 7 and removal of rings 3 and 5, the composite is removed, graphite is trimmed from its cut edges such as those corresponding to the cylinder bores , and the composite is then passed between polished steel faced rollers to compress the graphite layers into foils of density of 1500 kg m3 and thus form the desired gasket. This can then be subjected to such conventional operations as the insertion of eyelets and treatment of the gasket surface to promote easy release as during engine servicing from a cylinder head and block.
