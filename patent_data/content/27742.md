# Self aligning aerosol dispensing device.

## Abstract
A self aligning overcap and button for aerosol containers including a button 22 having a side surface terminating upwardly in a cylindrical wall surrounding a recessed upper surface which includes two helical ramps extending in oppo site directions from a well adjacent to the wall to meet in a substantially radial edge diametrically opposite the well, and an overcap 16 for engagement with the button 22 , the overcap having a pointed alignment pin extending from the underside of an actuator tab 30 and in position for engage ment with the ramps and dimensioned for free insertion into the well in the button 22 . Rotational alignment of the overcap 16 and the button 22 are accomplished under the force of gravity. In preferred embodiments the cylindrical wall of the button 22 has an upper edge defining a plane substantially perpendicular to the axis of the button or the actuator tab 30 includes a cylindrical guide sleeve dimensioned to receive the button 22 .
