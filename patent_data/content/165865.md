# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR TESTING INTEGRATED CIRCUITS

## Abstract
A processor controlled IC component test apparatus adapted to be employed in line with automatic IC DIP component handling equipment is capable of conducting a preselected verification check of each IC device regardless of the orientation of the DIP in the device contact receptacle of the IC handling apparatus. As each device under test DUT is inserted into the apparatus test head, a pin check residual voltage measurement test is conducted to ensure that all the pins of the DUT are in contact with the contact terminals of the test head. If the pin check test establishes that all the pins of the DUT are in contact with the contact terminals of the test head, a prescribed non destructive impedance measure ment test is carried out in order to determine the orientation of the DIP in the test head. If the device passes the orientation test or is determined by the orientation test to be simply misoriented inserted upside down , it is then subjected to a prescribed functionality check with the direction of orienta tion taken into account . The processor architecture of the test apparatus is configured to maximize the system s ability to rapidly sequence through the test vectors for the various DUTs, while also offering the capability to perform traditional CPU functions during the execution of a test. For this purpose, the processor employs a mode controlled piperlined architecture through which program instructions stored in memory are controllably accessed and processed through either an address controlled flow path or a data controlled flow path.
