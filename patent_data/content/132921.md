# Hazardous waste steam generator.

## Abstract
A boiler fired by the combustion of pre mixed air and fluids which are or contain principle organic hazardous con stituents POHC comprising a combustion zone where said pre mixed air and POHC is burned, creating products of com bustion radiant heat transfer tubing in said combustion zone, the extent of said tubing and the flow of a fluid to be heated therein sufficient to cool said products of combustion to a conversion temperature where said POHC is converted to non POHC products an incineration section downstream of said combustion zone, said incineration section of extent sufficient to substantially maintain said conversion temperature for suf ficient residence time to cause said conversion of substan tially all of said POHC to non POHC products a cooling section downstream of said incineration section, convection heat transfer tubing and fluid to be heated therein in said cooling section sufficient to cool said products of combustion for exhaust for the atmosphere and means to cause the flow of fluid to be heated in said convection and said radiant heat transfer tubing.
