# Automatic resetting anti 2 block crane warning system.

## Abstract
Crane warning system operative to give audible and visual warning of an imminent 2 BLOCK condition and to prevent occurrence of an actual 2 BLOCK condition by means of a control output signal. The warning system is further operable to permit override of the indication of and control against the 2 BLOCK condition. Three distinct audible and visual indications are provided for NORMAL, 2 BLOCK, and OVERRIDE system states. The system is further operative to automatically reset to a NORMAL state from either a 2 BLOCK or OVERRIDE state upon sensing a transition from a 2 BLOCK condition to a NORMAL condition.
