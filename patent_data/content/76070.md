# Transcutaneous signal transmission system.

## Abstract
Greater positioning tolerance is permitted in inductively coupled transmitter 10 and receiver 12 tuned circuits by achieving critical coupling therebetween. Critical coupling at a predetermined distance is obtained by selecting the appropriate quality, Q, of the tuned circuit, whereby the quality of the transmitter tuned circuit is preferably three times larger than the quality of the receiver tuned circuit. In a transcutaneous signal transmission system the critical cou pling is realized by adjusting the spacing of the coils 21, 22 of the tuned circuits whereby the output voltage of the transmitter decreases to one half the output voltage with no coupling.
