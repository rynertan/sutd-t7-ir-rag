# Intermediate layer of silicon dioxide in thermal taransfer ribbon.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a thermal transfer ribbon for non impact, thermal printing by resistive heating in the ribbon. Between the resistive substrate of the ribbon and a steel support layer there is an intermediate layer of silicon dioxide. An outer layer on the steel support layer is the thermal ink.
