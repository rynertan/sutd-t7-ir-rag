# A ROTATING ALSO SELF WORKING DEVICE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF COSTLESS ELECTRIC ENERGY

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a rotating, also selfworking device for the production of costless electric energy being composed of a preferably direct current electric motor 5 , which, by means of interposed gears 2 and 4 idly mounted on a fixed casing, causes the operation of the power shaft of a generator 7 which is able to supply electric energy to possible utilizers and also to give back to said motor a quantity of energy sufficient to allow it to work, upon its transformation into direct current by means of an appropriate transformer commuter chopper 11 , the starting of said device being assured by a storage battery 10 which supplies said motor.
