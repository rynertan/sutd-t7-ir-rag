# Sensing mechanism for controlling the mode change of an accumulator conveyor.

## Abstract
An accumuiator conveyor 10 is equipped with sensors 40 which respond to article movement by pivoting about a vertical axis as the result of having a pair of laterally spaced wheels 41, 42 on opposite ends of a shaft 43 with one wheel 41 driven by the propelling member 17 and the other by an article supporting roller 13a . The first wheel 41 is larger than the second wheel 42 and is attached to the shaft 43 while the second wheel 42 is connected to the shaft 43 by a one way clutch 47 . Pivotal movement of the sensor results from differentiation between the relative speeds of the wheels to shift the accumulator conveyor between accumulation and transport modes.
