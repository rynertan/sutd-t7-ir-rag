## Description
This invention relates to a suction device for an endoscope allowing for easy brushing of the interior of a suction pipe. An endoscope is generally provided with a suction tube, through which, for example, a viscous liquid, filth and blood retained in the coeliac cavity are drawn off. This suction tube is generally divided into a first section constituting the upstream region extending from the control section of the endoscope to the tip of the distal end of the insertion section and a second section constituting the downstream region extending from said control section to the connector connected to the end of the universal cord. Those portions of the first and second tube sections which are held in the control section are partly connected to a suction changeover valve provided in the control section. Operation of said suction changeover valve effects suction. Recently, problems have arisen because of a hospital infection resulting from HB antigens. To avoid the occurrence of such event, it is strongly recommended not only to pass a disinfecting liquid through a suction tube generally contaminated by patient s blood, but also to force a brush into the suction tube to clean its interior. To this end, it is contemplated to detachably fit a piston constituting the suction changeover valve into a cylinder and, when the piston is removed, to insert a brush from a cylinder open at the control section into the upstream region of the suction tube partly connected to the cylinder there to clean the interior of said upstream region. When, however, a brush is inserted into a suction tube at the other end of the first tube region open to the distal end of the insertion section or at the other end of the second tube region open to the connector, then the filth remaining in the suction tube tends to leak from the suction changeover valve to the control section. If the angle knob and eyepiece provided in the control section are contaminated, then much effort will be needed to wash and disinfect these members. When, therefore, the suction tube is to be brushed, it is preferable to insert a brush from the cylinder holding the detachable suction changeover valve into both upstream and downstream tube regions. With the conventional endoscope, however, either upstream or downstream region the suction tube is connected at one end to the peripheral wall of the cylinder. Therefore, one end of that suction tube region which is connected to the peripheral wall of the cylinder is open in a direction intersecting the axis of the cylinder at right angles. Consequently considerable difficulties are encountered in inserting a brush into said suction tube region. If it is tried to forcefully pass a brush through said suction tube region, the brush will be damaged at once. It is accordingly the object of this invention to provide a suction device for an endoscope, wherein the upstream and downstream regions of a suction tube are connected in a way, allowing for the easy insertion without damage of a brush into said upstream and downstream suction tube regions for efficient cleaning. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Figs. 1 and 2 show a suction device for an endoscope according to one embodiment of this invention, wherein Fig. 1 is a schematic view of the whole endoscope, Fig. 2 is sectional view of the suction device. Description is now given with reference to Figs. 1 and 2 of a suction device for an endoscope according to one embodiment of this invention. Reference numeral 1 denotes an endoscope including an insertion section 2 introduced into the coeliac cavity of the human body, and a control section 3 set outside of the human body. The control section 3 is connected to a universal cord 5 whose end is fitted with a connector 4. The outer end of the insertion section 2 is provided with an observation optical system 6, which is optically connected to an eyepiece section 7. A suction tube 8 extends through the endoscope 1. This suction tube 8 comprises a first suction tube section 9 constituting an upstream region extending from the distal end of the insertion section 2 to the control section 3 and a second suction tube section 10 constituting a downstream region extending from the control section 3 to the connector 4 through the universal cord 5. The first suction tube section 9 is connected at one end to a suction changeover valve 11 provided in the control section 3 and at the other end is open to the distal end 2a of the insert section 2. The second suction tube section 10 is connected at one end to the suction changeover valve 11 and at the other end communicates with a mouthpiece 4a connected to a suction pump not shown fitted to the connector 4. The suction changeover valve 11 is constructed as shown in Fig. 2. The outer wall 3a of the control section 3 has a fitting hole 12 drilled into it, into which a cylinder 38 is inserted. The upper portion of the first cylinder 38 projects to the outside of the control section 3 through its outer wall 3a. Said projecting upper portion of the cylinder 38 opens at both ends. A stepped portion 14 engageable with the inside of the outer wall 3a of the control section 3 is formed in the intermediate part of said outer wall 3a. A male screw 15 in formed in said outer peripheral wall 3a. A female screw formed in the inner wall of the control section 3 is engaged with said male screw 15. The first cylinder 38 is fixed to the outer wall 3a of the control section 3 by means of an annular stop member 16 whose lower end portion is pressed against said outer wall 3a and a stepped portion 14. The annular fitting member 16 comprises an upper flange 16a and a lower flange 16b having a larger diameter than said upper flange 16a and has a cross section substantially shaped like a trough. The bottom of the lower flange 16b is pressed against said outer wall 3a. Provided at the bottom of the cylinder 38 is a connection tube 18 set in parallel to said axis. The bottom hole of the cylinder 38 is connected to the connection tube 18 which constitute a part of the suction tube 10. A brush hole 39 is formed in the cylinder 38 communicate the inside of the cylinder to the first suction tube section 9. An opening of the brush hole 39 is faced with the opening of the cylinder and extends to incline against the axis of the cylinder so that brush may be inserted into the brush hole 39 through the opening of the cylinder. The suction tube 9 is connected to the cylinder 38 to communicate it. A passage 22 is drilled eccentrically to the cylinder 38. The second connection tube 18 to which the second suction tube section 10 is connected is fitted to the lower end of said passage 22, namely, the bottom of the cylinder 38. This cylinder 38 is provided with the brush hole 39 which is inclined to the axis of said cylinder 38, one end of which communicates with the passage 22 and the other end of which is open to the bottom part of the cylinder 38. The first suction tube section 9 is directly connected to said brush hole 39. The hollow piston 23 inserted into the passage 22 has a cylindrical form whose upper end is closed, and whose lower end is open. The interior space of said hollow piston 23 is used as a communication path 47. The hollow piston 23 is not provided with a leak path directly open to the atmosphere. A rotation preventing slot 44 is provided which is open to the bottom of the hollow piston 23. The outer end of a rotation preventing pin 45 extending diametrically to the cylinder 38 is engaged with said rotation preventing slot 44, thereby preventing the rotation of the hollow piston 23. Connected to the upper end of the hollow piston 23 is a shaft 53 which is set eccentric from said hollow piston 23, but concentric with the cylinder 38. A first flange 54 is provided at the lower end of said shaft 53, and a second flange 55 is formed at the upper end of said shaft 53. The cross section of the peripheral wall of an urging member 27 elastically holding the hollow piston 23 has a zigzag outline. A suction hole 52 is drilled on one of the convex portions of said zigzag peripheral wall of the urging member 27. A depression 57 is formed in the inner wall of the top portion of the urging member 27 for engagement with the second flange 55 of the shaft 53. Provided in the inner peripheral wall of the lower end of the urging member 27 is a ridge 42 which is engaged with the upper and lower planes of a projection 58 formed on the intermediate part of the outer peripheral wall of the piston 23. While the hollow piston 23 is held in a lifted position by the urging member 27 as illustrated in Fig. 2, the communication hole 25 formed in the wall of the hollow piston 23 is made to communicate with the atmosphere at the upper end of the cylinder 38. As a result, the first suction tube section 10 can communicate with the atmosphere through said communication hole 25 and the suction hole 52 formed in the urging member 27. A brush hole 39 is closed by that portion of the piston 23 which is received in the passage 22. A projecting wall block 59 is provided at the upper end portion of the cylinder 38 at a point facing the communication hole 25. This wall block 59 prevents filthy substances carried through the communication path 47 from being ejected from the suction hole 52 through the communication hole 25. When the hollow piston 23 is pressed downward against the righting moment of the urging member 27 until the first flange 54 formed at the lower end of the shaft 53 is pressed against the upper end of the cylinder 38, then the communication hole 25 is made to face the brush hole 39, thereby causing the first and second suction tube sections 9, 10 to communicate with each other through the communication hole 47 formed in the piston 23. An endoscope suction device arranged as described with reference to Fig. 2 also enables the interior of the first and second suction tube sections 9, 10 to be cleaned by inserting the brush therethrough when both urging member 27 and piston 23 are taken off the cylinder 38. With an endoscope suction device embodying this invention, one of the upstream and downstream sections is connected at one end, as previously described, to the bottom of the suction changeover cylinder whereas the other one is inclined with an acute angle to the axis of the cylinder. Therefore, the brush can be inserted into the upstream and downstream sections of the suction tube from the cylinder without being damaged, thereby assuring the reliable and efficient brushing of the suction tube.
