# AUTOMATIC METHOD FOR SEPARATING AND CLEANING SILICON CARBIDE FURNACE MATERIALS

## Abstract
Method of automatically separating and cleaning silicon carbide furnace materials using magnetic separation techni ques. In the method of the invention, crushed or particulate silicon carbide furnace materials are mixed with a magnetic powder. The lower grade silicon carbide particles are then separated from the first grade silicon carbide crystals using magnetic separation means. Recoveries of at least 75 of the first grade silicon carbide are possible using the method of the invention. This method is also useful for the beneficia tion of ores, minerals, or man made materials.
