# Boxing for concrete buildings and method of use.

## Abstract
A boxing is suggested for concrete buildings which comprises, as a structural skeleton of the building to be erected, a supporting structure for conventional wood panels to close the boxing. The supporting structure, to be composed and assembled at the building yard, is composed by assemblable and interchangeable members of bent stamped sheet metal 23 , shaped and perforated, and on such members there are removably secured the wood panels 20 which are then held united together by appropriate tie bars 27 . In erection, the supporting structure, composed of uprights and the horizontal structural set 24 is first assembled, by preparing beforehand the openings for the doors and windows. In the hollow spaces within the walls there are positioned all the appliances 37 for each kind of service which is desired, whereafter the boxing is closed by the wood panels 20 and the concrete mixture is poured into the boxing.

## Description
BOXING FOR CONCRETE BUILDINGS AND METHOD OF USE . This invention relates to a boxing for concrete buildings as well as to a method for using such a boxing. It is well known that the conventional methods for erecting buildings are very cumbersome and required long times of processing and also specialized workmanship for the several complementary steps which are necessary to build a house for civil dwelling. The constructional run for concrete by employing reinforced concrete both for providing the horizontal and the vertical structural members is conventionally performed by casting concrete mixture into boxings placed in the building yard for the formation of a reinforced concrete skeleton, whereafter the internal and external closures are made with masonry walls, which are generally hollow so as to house the servicing installations therein.This erection process, which is performed in sequentially ordered complete steps has, furthermore, the defect that the finishing operations cannot be carried out simultaneously. By the partial or integral prefabrication it has been attempted to solve these problems, while reducing both the working times and the first costs, but this mode of building has originated other problems, such as, above all, that of shipping the prefabricated members and their manipulation at the building yards, in union with the well known uneasiness of assembling the prefabricated component parts and the resultant questionable solidity of the building so obtained. An object of the present invention is thus to offset the drawbacks of the constructional methods heretofore conventional, by drastically reducing the times which are required for erecting building for civil dwelling and removing to a degree the specialized workmanship for the different operations, while still ensuring a considerable accuracy in processing, also in sequentially ordered steps and without originating problems as to shipping and manipulation. Having this object in view, this invention suggests, in the first place, a newly conceived boxing, by employing which it becomes possible to adopt a novel erection procedure which affords a number of advantages both as regards the rapidity of performance of the works and the accuracy of the erection steps with a reduced workmanship and without specialized people. The boxing according to the invention is essentially characterized in that it comprises a supporting structure or framing for conventional boxing closure panels, composed of assemblable and interchangeable members of stamped, bent and perforarated sheet metal, said sheet metal members being intended to provide a vertical and horizontal structural skeleton to which are removably affixable the boxing closure panels. The fundamental component part of said supporting structure is a member which can serve both as an upright and as a beam and is substantially composed of two L shaped rolled sections confrontingly spaced apart from one another with their longer webs which are connected together at regular intervals by couples of small tubes, whereas the shorter webs of the two rolled sections lie on the same plane and are equipped with bores for securing the boxing closure panels resting against the outer surfaces of said shorter webs. These component parts which are intended to act indifferently as uprights and as beams have a standard length and can properly be jointed together to provide a pillar or a floor beam of the supporting structure. In order to make it possible to assemble the supporting structure starting from a horizontal plane, which can be the foundation plane or the plane of a previously cast floor, an element is provided, to be called a base board, said element being similar to the upright beam element aforementioned, but is shorter than the latter and has a baseplate for resting on said reference plane. The supporting structure of the boxing then comprises a few auxiliary elements, such as foraminous junction plates, joint coverings, takeup Z shaped plates, angular plates, tie bars of adjustable length and others, as will be better understood from the ensuing detailed description aided by the accompanying drawings. By adopting the boxing provided according to the present invention it is possible to carry out an erection method for houses for civil dwelling which is clearly distinguished over those of the prior and contemporary art and this both in comparison with the conventional processes using boxings assembled at the building yards and those which use prefabricated elements. The erection method according to the present invention provides in the first place the laying and assembling of the supporting structure composed of uprights and beams following a preselected pattern and providing also the openings for doors and windows, whereafter there are positioned within the hollow spaces of the walls, possibly after having applied the panels of either surface thereof, the installations for any kind of services, the iron reinforcing bars and others, whereafter the boxing closure us proceeded with by applying the panels to the other surface of the walls and lastly carrying out the casting of the concrete mix by pouring it down .initially in the outer and inner walls and then in the floors and cantilevers, if any, whereupon the entire surface exposed is smoothly plastered. Once the concrete has duly ripened and the boxing is dismantled to recover all the boxing items, it is possible to proceed at once with all the necessary fini shing steps. It should be noted that, differently from the procedure which employs prefabricated building blocks, with all the attendant troubles as to shipping and handling at the building yards, this invention affords the considerable advantage that the several sheet metal components which compose the supporting structure of the boxing are lightweight and can thus easily shipped and handled. Further features and advantages of the present invention will become more clearly apparent from the ensuing detailed description of a practical exemplary embodiment, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, wherein FIGURE 1 is a diagrammatical plan view of the pattern of a few rooms of a dwelling. FIGURE 2 is an elevational view, partly in section taken along the line II II of FIGURE 1. FIGURES 3, 4 and 5 are side view and cross sectional views, the latter taken along the arrow 3 and the lines IV IV and V V of Figure 2, of details of the structure shown in Figure 2. FIGURE 6 shows in detail and on an enlarged scale the bottom end of an upright of the supporting structure of the boxing. FIGURE 7 shows in detail and on an enlarged scale a corner of the boxing in horizontal cross sectional view. FIGURE 8 is a view taken along the direction of the arrows A A of FIGURE 7 of a corner member. FIGURE 9 shows the development on a plane of the corner member. FIGURE 10 shows a modification of an angle zone of the boxing in horizontal cross sectional view taken along the line X X of FIGURE 11, and FIGURE 11 shows the same modification in elevation, and partly in cross section taken along the lineXI XI of FIGURE 10. As can be seen in FIGURE 1, on a horizontal foundation plane or an already cast floor, the trend of the inner and the outer walls of a set of rooms to be erected is patterned, on taking into account the thicknesses of the walls one desires to erect and of the wood panels of the boxing and indicating the positions and the dimensions of the doors, windows, servicing appliances, installations and the like. In addition, the drawing clearly shows by small squares the positions of the uprights for the walls and by dotted lines the positions of the floor beams forming the supporting structure for the boxing as provided according to the invention. In FIGURE 1 there are clearly indicated such small squares 10, the dotted lines 11 for the floor beams and the thickness 12 of the wood panels for the boxing. In addition, there are shown windows 13 and doors 14. Following said pattern the supporting structure for the boxing is now erected. In the first place, at each position of an upright small square 10 in FIGURE 1 , there is laid and secured by nails or otherwise on said horizontal plane a baseboard element 15 see FIGURE 2 and more particularly FIGURES 3, 4 and 6 . The baseboard 15 is composed of two L shaped rolled sections, 16 and 17, respectively, which are integral at either end with a baseplate 18. The two rolled irons 16 and 17 are confrontingly mounted and spaced apart from one another with their longer webs 16a and 17a see FIGURES 3 and 4 which are mutually interconnected by a couple of small tubes 19, whereas their shorter webs 16b and 17b lies on the same plane and carry bores 21 for fastening the boxing closure panels 20.Also the baseplate 18 has bores 22 for securing the baseboard 15 on the horizontal plane see FIGURES 2 and 6 . To the sides of the longer webs 16a, 17a of the baseboard 15 there are secured foraminous plates 23 for regulation. The fastening of such plates 23 takes place by the aid of bolts slipped through the small tubes 19 which connect the rolled irons 16, 17 of the baseboard 15 and, by shifting the fastening bores, it is possible to vary the height of the upright to adjust it to the desired level. As a matter of fact, the upright components 24, the first of which is secured to the couple of plates 23, have a standard length. Thus, for example, with three upright elements 24 plus a baseboard 15 and a couple of plates 23 for adjustment it is possible to attain the desired height, as shown in FIGURE 2. The upright elements 24 have the same configura tion as the baseboard elements 15, the only difference being that the former are longer than the latter and are not fitted with the baseplate 18. Conversely the elements 24 are equipped with a plurality of couples of small tubes 19 for connecting the longer webs of the rolled sections in the shape of an L, said couples of small tubes being marshalled along the length of said roller sections. It is thus apparent that, to the couple of plates 23 secured to the baseboard element 15, there is fastened, in turn, by bolting, the first upright element 24 and that, to the latter, the second upright element 24 is superposedly attached and is united therewith by two joint coverings 25 and so forth. To ensure the perfect vertical trim of the upright, between the first element 24 and a specially provided plumbing tag 26 an adjustable tensioning device 27 can be inserted as shown in FIGURES 2 and 6, which also acts as a shore. It is to be noted that the assembling of the upright elements 24 which serve to attain the desired wall height, that is of those elements 24 which follow the first one which has been secured to the baseboard 15 via the couple of adjusting plates 23, can be carried out on a plane, then completing the last element 24 with appropriate terminal headers which are requird for the several subsequent operations.All the assembly of these elements united together can thus be lifted and connected to the first upright element which has already been erected and vertically plumbed, An upright intended for coacting with a floor beam is completed with terminal headers consisting of takeup Z shaped plates, indicated at 28 in FIGURE 5, an upright placed on the outer periphery being intended to limit the floor thickness is completed at its top by two adjusting plates 23 and an upright which is intended to have united thereto a short cantilever beam can be terminated by joint coverings such as 25 and so forth. The wall corners, both internal and external, are made with two uprights, as shown in FIGURE 7, which are connected together by special angle plates 29 and 30, right and left, respectively, one of which is shown in another view also in FIGURE 8 and in the development on plane in FIGURE 9. Each of these angle plates comprises a first bedplate 31 having two bores for connecting, by bolting, to a couple of small tubes 19 which connect the longer webs 16a and 17a of an upright element 24. From the bedplate 31 is bent at right angles a wall 32 which is terminated by an oblique edge, from which is bent at right angles a second bedplate 33 oriented along a direction opposite to that of the first bedplate 31. Also this second bedplate 33 has two bores. From the wall 32 there are then bent towards the first bedplate 31 two reinforcing webs 34, 35 which are made integral with the bedplate 31 itself. The right and the left angle plates are distinguished from one another exclusively in that the bedplates 31 and 33 are bent relative to the wall 32 in opposite directions, on taking into account that the webs 34, 35 are always bent towards the first bedplate 31. At any corner, be it external or internal, there are provided couples of right and left angle plates 29, 30 which are connected together in correspondence with their second bedplates 33, the latter being positioned the one along side the other by bolting or otherwise, as can be clearly seen in FIGURE 7. Obviously, along the entire height of an upright there can be provided more than one couple of such angle plates 29, 30. It is to be observed, in addition, that the uprights of the supporting structure which relate to the same building wall are positioned pairwise symmetrically and frontally so as to be able to provide conveniently, through the slits between the two L shaped rolled sections forming the uprights, for the positioning of tie bars and spreaders to ensure the tightness of the boxing. Once the assemblage of all the vertical structural elements of the supporting structure has been completed, the assemblage of the horizontal structure can be started. Such an horizontal structure is made up with the same elements which have already been exploited for the vertical structure. It comprises beam elements and bracket elements for overhangingly supporting balconies, eaves and like members. These elements can be mounted already completed on the ground in readiness for being secured to the components of the vertical structure. Substantially, the upright elements 24, already disclosed in the foregoing, are used once again, but now they act as beams and the adjusting plates 23 are likewise used. As outlined above, the union between an upright and a horizontal beam is carried out by using takeup Zplates 28. The details of such a union can be seen in FIG. 5. To the upper couple of small tubes 19 of the last upright element 24 at top there are bolted two Z plates 28. Each web of each Z plate has four bores with a couple of bores oriented vertically and the second couple oriented horizontally. To these two Z plates there can be secured two adjustment plates 23 so as to attain the desired beam span, and to the plates 23 there are secured again two additional Z plates. Between the free webs of the latter the first element 24 is now secured, which has now the function of a beam, that is, with its two larger webs arranged vertically and with its shorter webs arranged horizontally and directed upwardly. The junction between subsequent elements 24 is still made by joint coverings 25.As outlined above all the component parts which are necessary to make up an entire beam can be assembled and completed still on the ground in readiness for being fastened to the Z plates 28 carriedatop the upright elements 24. In order that the necessary stiffness and resistance may be obtained for the horizontal structure with a view of supporting the load of a floor having the required thickness of concrete slabs, it is possible to provide a truss like arrangement by exploiting tension ties 27 as shown in FIGURE 2. By properly adjusting such tension ties it is possible to produce the tension which is required for obtaining the beam sag reversal necessary for effecting the casting in plane. Once that the horizontal beams have been installed, the continuity between the vertical and the horizontal structures is achieved. Of course, in the case of considerably long spans, it is possible to provide appropriate reinforcing posts, by using spreaders and tensioning elements. Also in order to provide overhanging brackets for balconies, eaves and the like, the same structural elements as described above can be utilized. Once the skeleton or the supporting structures of the boxing have been completed, one may proceed with the operation of implementing, whenever this is requested, the walls and the floor and positioning the appliances for any kind of services as desired and anything that one desired to leave embedded in the thickness of the walls and the floor. In order to make more convenient the laying of pipes, conduits, prefabricated complete units for bathrooms and kitchens, electricity sockets and the like, it is advisable to previously apply the wood panels of the boxing relative to either wall surface and those for the floor boxing, by provisionally securing them to the sides of the upright beam elements 24 by using the specially provided bores 21 for the nails so as to make up an open boxing. FIGURE 6 shows by way of example how there can be positioned within a wall a water distribution unit 36 intended to connect the pipelines of a bathroom and or a kitchen to vertical pipelines 37 embedded within the wall thickness, whereas in the thickness of the floor horizontal pipes 38 are embedded. It is apparent that the operations of laying, jointing and others for all of these services can easily be carried out with the boxing still open, whereas the fittings intended to protrude out of the wall surfaces shall be shielded in any appropriate way. Once also the operation of equipping the walls with the servicing conduits has been completed, also the reinforcing irons for the concrete are preset and positioned, whereafter the boxing is sealed by applying the other wood panels thereto. During this stage of completion of the boxing,also the tie bars and the spreaders for latching the wood panels are properly placed in position. The setting of the inner and outer window and door frames deserves be mentioned now. To provide the boxing outside the window and door openings one uses as the supporting members the Z plates 28 and the foraminous plates 23 for adjustment as shown in FIGURE 2.About the so formed empty spaces one can place the counterframes of the doors and the counterframes of the windows can be placed in position by exploiting appropriate means to have these component parts embedded in the cast concrete. The empty spaces to be allowed for the headrooms to be left for sliding shutter compartments and the like are obtained by inserting appropriate shims, for example ones of expanded plastics materials, to be removed upon casting the concrete mix and to be thrown away subsequently. On completion of the operation described above, the boxing is readiness for effecting the concrete mixture casting thereinto, to be carried out by pouring is continuously in the form of a sticky and soft putty and starting from the outer and the inner walls and ending with the floors and the overhanging portions of the building.Once the desired thickness for the floors is achieved, the entire exposed surface is plastered and smoothed. It is possible to effect the casting of an entire house or a floor or a room, with the internal and external partition walls. Once the concrete cast has hardened the overhauling run is started so as to recover the entire machinery employed, both of wood and iron, which made up the boxing and this machinery can be reused for a subsequent production run. The tensile stresses in the hardened concrete as applied to the boxing which holds it is discharged, during overhauling of the boxing, by first loosening the bolts of the adjustment plates at the foot of the uprights. Subsequently, the tie bars are slipped out and the bolts, if any, whereafter all the remaining component parts of the boxing can be removed conveniently. The concrete structure obtained in this way is in immediate readiness for all the necessary finishing operations. In the exemplary embodiment of the boxing as described in the foregoing paragraphs, provision is made for closing the boxing by means of wood panels to be recovered as the concrete has properly hardened. It is quite possible, however, to use also no reuse panels, that is panels intended to be left permanently embedded in the casting both on the internal and the external side of the walls. In this case, after having installed the supporting structure, proper provision is made to apply to the upright elements first spaced wooden slabs to which there are subsequently secured the boxing closure panels. During overhauling of the boxing the wooden slabs are recovered and withdrawn while the panels remain integral with the casing. FIGURES 10 and 11 show this possibility and illustrative also of a modification of the formation of the corners of the walls. These latter FIGURES of drawings show the wooden slabs 40 to be recovered, which are secured to the uprights of the supporting structure and it is likewise possible to see the non reusable panels 41 which are temporarily secured to the wooden slabs 40 and which close the boxing. The modification relative to the formation of the corners consists in employing, in the stead of the special angle plates 29, 30 shown in FIGURES 8 and 9, simple angled rolled sections 43 arranged as can clearly be seen inFIGURES 10 and 11 to latch the wooden slabs 40 in correspondence with the corners. To this purpose, the wooden slabs 40 are caused alternatingly to project beyond the edges of the corners and a stable union is thus obtained which well withstands the thrust originated by the concrete casting. From the foregoing description anyone skilled in the art is enabled fully to appreciate the advantages of both the boxing and the erection method according to the invention. These advantages mainly reside in the rapidity and the accuracy of the operations which can be carried out by not particularly trained personnel, the versatility of the structural elements which are used, which can then be exploited once and once again for many times and in ever changing situations, the ease of shipment and mani pulation in the building yards of the structural elements in question. It is to be noted, also, that the number of structural elements is reduced by virtue of the possibility of using them for different purposes.
