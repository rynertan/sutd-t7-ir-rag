# Microinstruction substitution mechanism in a control store.

## Abstract
A microinstruction control storage mechanism includes a read only store ROS , writeable control store WCS , first cycle control store, and a reserved portion of main storage in a data processing system. As required, blocks of microin structions are paged into the WCS from the main storage. An array of single bit storace aevices, accessed by microinstruc tion addresses utilized to access microinstructions from the ROS, signal the existence of a faulty microinstruction from the ROS as determined by maintenance or design personnel. In response to a halt signal from an accessed single bit storage device, an address substitution mechanism creates a microinstruction address which identifies a main storage location and may have to be used to initiate transfer of a block of microinstructions from main storage to the WCS to provide access to a particular substitute microinstruction for the faulty microinstruction.
