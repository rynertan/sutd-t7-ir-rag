# APPARATUS FOR DETECTING A PARTICLE AGGLUTINATION PATTERN

## Abstract
A laser light beam emitted from a laser light source is de flected by a swingable mirror by a given angle and a deflected laser light beam is focused onto bottom surfaces of the reac tion vessels formed in a microplate in a matrix form by a first Fresnel s lens having an object focal point situating at an axis about which the mirror is swung and an image focal point situ ating at the bottom surfaces of the reaction vessels. By swing ing the mirror, particle agglutination patterns formed on the bottom surfaces of the reaction vessels arranged in a row are successively scanned by the laser light spot. The light beam passing through the reaction vessel is focused onto a photo electric converting device by means of a second Fresnel s lens to produce an electrical signal representing the particle agglu tination patterns. A shielding plate having a plurality of open ings formed therein is arranged in front of the second Fres nel s lens.
