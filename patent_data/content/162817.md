# Actuator of linear motion with a rack like member and a rotating member.

## Abstract
The actuator of rapid linear variable motion comprises a linear member 10 fixed or sliding having a concave cylindrical surface with generatrices parallel to the direction of motion of said member, on which variable pitch helix like and shaped channels 9 are formed and a rotating member 3 with its axis parallel to the linear member 19 and pro vided with pegs 7 angularly distributed and capable of com ing in contact, one after the other, with limited contemporaneousness, with the channels 9 of the linear member 10 .
