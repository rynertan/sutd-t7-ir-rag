# Electrochromic display device.

## Abstract
An electrochromic display device comprises two substrates 17, 20 117, 120 217, 220 317, 320 , elec trodes 18, 21 118, 121 218 319 , formed on one or both substrates at least one of the electrodes being a display electrode 18, 118, 218, 318 , which is coated with a layer of an electrochromic material 19, 119, 219, 319 and, an electrolyte 23, 123, 223, 323 held between the substrates. The electrochromic material is a layer of the iron III hexacyanoferrate II salt which is re versibly changed in colour through electrochemical oxi dation and reduction reactions induced between the electrodes so as to provide a display.
