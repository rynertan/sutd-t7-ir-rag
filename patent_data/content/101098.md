# A process for conveying a particulate solid fuel.

## Abstract
Particulate solid fuel is conveyed from an atmospheric container into an atmospheric lock hopper which is then pressurized by means of a high pressure inert gas. The fuel is passed from the pressurized lock hopper into a pressure vessel and subsequently from this vessel into a gasification reactor. In the container and the lock hopper the solid fuel is fluidized by means of an inert gas. In the pressure vessel a carbon monoxide and hydrogen containing gas is used for this purpose, a similar gas being applied for the pneumatic transport of the fuel from the vessel into the reactor.
