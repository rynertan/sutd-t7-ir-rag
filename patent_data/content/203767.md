# Improved automated acousto optic infra red analyzer system for monotoring stack emissions.

## Abstract
An automated acousto optic analyzer system provided with an acousto optic tunable filter coupled with a source of radiation to produce pulsed light at predetermined wavelengths. This light is transmitted through a gas stack to a distant detector. The tunable filter, radiation source on one side and a detector on the opposite side of an environment produces spatial separation of the tuned, diffracted light from the undiffracted broad spectrum of the light source at the detector. Eliminates polarizers in the system. It combines the tuning function of the AOTF with a chopping function, allowing extraneous radiation to be discriminated against.
