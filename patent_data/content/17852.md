# A process for splitting alkylenebisphenols.

## Abstract
Alkylenebisphenols are converted or cleaved to phe nols and alkyl and or alkenyl substituted phenols in good yields by contacting with hydrogen in the presence of a nickel oxide manganese oxide metal oxide supported ca talyst. In a specific embodiment, bisphenol A is converted to isopropylphenol at high selectivity and high conversion by contacting with hydrogen in the presence of a nickel oxide manganese oxide magnesium oxide catalyst.
