# Closed cell polyimide foams and methods of making same.

## Abstract
A high temperature and flame resistant closed cell poly imide foam material and methods of making the foam. An aro matic tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride is reacted with an oxo mine to produce an N substituted imide, which is then esterifi ed with a suitable alcohol. The resulting liquid is dried and the dry residue is reduced to a uniform powder having particles with diameters generally in the 0.5 to 10 mm range. The powder is preferably further dried, either before or after final size re duction, in a moderate vaccum at moderate temperature to re move any excess residual alcohol. The powder spontaneously expands to form a closed cell foam when heated to a tempera ture in the range of about 90 to 150 C for a suitable period. When the powder is expanded in a closed mold, a well consoli dated, uniform, closed cell foam product results. When ex panded in an unrestricted manner, closed cell macrobal loons having average diameters between about 0.4 and 15 mm result. The closed cell foam produced has excellent flexibility and resistance to heat and flame, and does not shrink appreciably when exposed to flame.
