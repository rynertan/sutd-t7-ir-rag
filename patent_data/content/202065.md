## Description
This invention relates to a biodegradable degradable Biodegradable high molecular polymers may be used, for example, as excipients for pharmaceutical preparations such as microcapsules. As examples of such biodegradable high molecular polymers, copolymers of lactic acid and glycolic acid are known to be obtainable by polycondensation of lactic acid and glycolic acid in the presence of a strongly acidic ion exchange resin cf. U.S. Patent No. 4,273,920 . The present inventors also established that polymers or copolymers of lactic acid and or glycolic acid may be obtained by polycondensation in the presence of a solid inorganic acid catalyst or by polycondensation without a catalyst followed by removal of water and then polycondensation cf. EPC Patent Publication laid open No. 0171907 . When produced by the methods so far used, biodegradable high molecular polymers contain low molecular compounds such as an unreacted monomer or monomers and polymers of low polymerization degree, so that when they are used in producing microcapsules, incorporation rates into microcapsules of drugs to be microencapsulated are decreased or the so called initial burst, namely extraordinarily initial drug release from microcapsules after administration, tends to increase. Furthermore, biodegradable high molecular polymers are chemically unstable. When allowed to stand at room temperature for several weeks to several months, they undergo degradation, which results in a decrease in the polymerization degree. In view of the above drawbacks, the present inventors treated said biodegradable high molecular polymers by a variety of methods and, as a result, it was found that the content of water soluble low molecular compounds may be reduced by treating said polymers with water or a mixture of water and an organic solvent readily soluble in water. Further investigation based on this finding has now led to completion of the present invention. Thus, the invention provides a biodegradable high molecular polymer with a weight average molecular weight of from 5,000 to 35,000, characterised in that said polymer consists of 50 100 mole percent of lactic acid residues and 50 0 mole percent of glycolic acid residues and a content of lactic acid or lactic acid and glycolic acid of less than 0.01 mole per 100 grams of said polymer. Preferably the content of lactic acid or lactic acid and glycolic acid is 0.0055 mole per 100 grams of said polymer. The invention also provides a method of producing the biodegradable high molecular polymer of the invention which method consists in preparing the polymer from lactic acid or lactic acid and glycolic acid under agueous reaction conditions, and thereafter reducing the content of lactic acid or lactic acid and glycolic acid in said polymer to a level of less than 0.01 mole per 100 grams of said polymer by extraction with water or a mixture of water and a water soluble organic solvent, characterised in that said extraction step comprises dissolving said polymer containing not less than 0.01 mole percent of lactic acid or lactic acid and glycolic acid in a 3 to 20 times amount w v of an organic solvent, and pouring the resulting solution into water with stirring at a temperature of from 20 C to 70 C. The water soluble organic solvent is preferably ethanol. The invention additionally provides a microcapsule for injectable sustained release containing effective amount of an active ingredient and as an excipient, a biodegradable high molecular polymer as defined above and a method of producing the microcapsule which comprises preparing a water oil w o emulsion with a solution containing said active ingredient serving as an inner water phase and a solution containing said biodegradable polymer serving as an oil phase dispersing said emulsion in a water w phase to yield a w o w emulsion and subjecting the resulting emulsion to contact with a third aqueous phase to yield a w o w ternary phase emulsion, the solvent in the oil phase being desorbed. The invention further provides the use of a biodegradable high molecular polymer as defined above as a matrix in a microcapsule for prolonged delivery of an active ingredient from said microcapsule. The biodegradable high molecular polymer to serve as the starting material in performing the method of the invention may be produced by any method, for example by the method described in the above cited U.S. Patent No. 4,273,920 and EPC Patent Publication laid open No. 0171907. Said starting material contains lactic acid or lactic acid and glycolic acid in an amount of not less than 0.01 mole per 100 grams thereof. The content of water soluble monobasic acid may be determined by ordinary neutralization titration. Thus, for example, 300 mg of a starting high molecular compound is dissolved in 10 ml of dichloromethane, the solution is stirred and shaken with 20 ml of distilled water for 10 minutes, the mixture is separated into an aqueous phase and an oily phase using a centrifuge, and the aqueous phase is assayed for free acids by neutralization titration using N 100 aqueous NaOH solution with phenolphthalein as an indicator. The number of moles of NaOH required for neutralization is converted to a free monobasic acid content. The biodegradable high molecular polymer according to the present invention preferably has good biocompatibility and thus includes, among others, hydroxy acid polyesters e.g. polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, polyhydroxybutyric acid . Said high molecular polymer may be a copolymer produced by using two or more different monomers as the monomers for forming said high molecular polymer. Said high molecular polymer may also be a block polymer or a graft polymer. Among the high molecular polymers mentioned above, those degradable Preferred examples of the high molecular polymer according to the present invention are polylactic acid and copolymers of lactic acid and glycolic acid. As the copolymers of lactic acid and glycolic acid, mention may be made of those comprising about 100 50 mole percent of lactic acid with the balance being glycolic acid. Furthermore, those copolymers of lactic acid and glycolic acid which have a weight average molecular weight of about 2,000 50,000 are preferred. Further mention may be made of those copolymers of lactic acid and glycolic acid which are composed of about 90 50 mole percent of lactic acid and about 10 50 mole percent of glycolic acid and have a weight average molecular weight of about 5,000 35,000 and an inherent viscosity of about 0.05 0.5 dl g as determined with a 0.5 weight percent chloroform solution thereof. Examples of the organic solvent readily soluble in water which are suited for use in carrying out the method of the present invention are acetone, methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile and ethyl acetate. Among these, preferred from the safety viewpoint are acetone and ethanol, and ethanol is more preferred. When a mixture of water and such readily water soluble organic solvent is used, the water organic solvent ratio v v may be within the range of about 100 0 to 100 100, especially 100 water. In carrying out the method of the invention, high molecular polymer as the raw material is preferably dissolved in a 3 to 20 timed amount w v of an organic solvent e.g. halogenated alkane e.g. dichloromethane, chloroform, dichloroethane, trichloroethane , acetone, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, benzene in advance, prior to treatment by said method since the use thereof in a solution form is advantageously more efficient, although it may be used also in solid form e.g. powder . Thus, when brought into contact with water or a mixture of water and an organic solvent readily soluble in water, such a high molecular polymerization product dissolved in an organic solvent may acquire a markedly increased contact surface area upon application of stirring or some other appropriate means. The method according to the invention is conducted generally at a temperature of about 0 90 C, preferably about 20 70 C. In accordance with the present invention, the raw material biodegradable high molecular polymerization product is mixed with water or a mixture of water and an organic solvent readily soluble in water with stirring to thereby remove water soluble low molecular compounds as a result of dissolution thereof in water or said mixture. Since the desired biodegradable high molecular polymer is insoluble in water or said mixture on that occasion, said low molecular compounds may be separated from the desired high molecular polymer. Although the ratio in quantity between water or a mixture of water and an organic solvent readily soluble in water and the raw material high molecular polymerization product is not critical for the method according to the invention, it is desirable that water or the mixture should be used in a large excess. The treatment may also be carried out in a system equipped with an appropriate collecting means and suited for continuous rinsing with water. The above mentioned stirring of water or the mixture may be effected by means of any of the ordinary stirrers, shakers, blenders and the like. Means highly capable of causing sufficient mixing to remove unreacted material or materials and water soluble low molecular compounds from said high molecular polymer to a satisfactory extent are desirable. Since the desired high molecular polymer is not dissolved in water or said mixture but precipitates or separates, it may be recovered by separating the precipitate, liquid droplets or solids by, for example, filtration or the like, and then drying the same. By carrying out the method according to the invention, water soluble low molecular compounds may be eliminated from the raw material high molecular polymerization product with good efficiency. In purifying high molecular polymerization products in general, the primary object is to remove catalysts, gaseous monomers, or highly toxic monomers e.g. vinyl chloride . In some instances, removal of low molecular compounds and or unreacted materials is also intended, like the present invention. In such instances, the distillation method is mostly employed to thereby remove initial boiling fractions. However, removal of trace amounts of water soluble substances is generally unnecessary and, as a general rule, such a method of removing trace amounts of water soluble substances as provided by the present invention is thought unnecessary and is not in practice. The biodegradable high molecular polymer thus obtained has the following features The biodegradable high molecular polymer obtained by the method of the present invention may be used, for instance, as an excipient for microcapsules. Thus, for example, sustained release microcapsules containing a water soluble ingredient, e.g. peptides such as those having luteinizing hormone releasing hormone like activity and thyroid hormone releasing hormone like activity may be produced by preparing a w o emulsion with a solution containing a water soluble ingredient serving as the inner water phase, with a drug retaining substance most preferably gelatin, albumin, pectin, agar, or the like added to the inner water phase as desired, and a solution containing the biodegradable high molecular polymer obtained by the method of the invention serving as the oil phase, dispersing said emulsion in a water phase to give a w o w emulsion preferably adjusting the viscosity of the w o emulsion for preparing said w o w emulsion to about 150 10,000 cp , and subjecting the latter emulsion to a third aqueous layer to give a w o w ternary layer emulsion and then the solvent in the oil layer is desorbed. The thus obtained microcapsules may be administered as a sustained release injection. The dose of such microcapsules may vary depending on the kind and content of the water soluble active ingredient, the dosage form, the duration of drug release, the animal to be treated e.g. warm blooded mammal such as mouse, rat, horse, cattle or human and the object of administration. In any case, a dose is sufficient if it corresponds to the effective amount of said active ingredient. For instance, the dose may be suitably selected within the range of about 0.02 200 mg kg, preferably about 0.2 40 mg kg, of microcapsules per administration. In the use in a suspension form for the above mentioned administration as an injection, the dose may be suitably selected within the range of about 0.1 5 ml, preferably about 0.5 3 ml, of the suspension. Fig. 1 represents the changes with time in residual drug content in the microcapsules obtained in Reference Example 3. The following reference examples and working examples illustrate the invention in further detail. About 10 g of each of three lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers ratio 75 25 average molecular weight 12,500 synthesized by different methods i.e. 1 strongly anionic ion exchange resin catalyst method, 2 solid acid acid clay catalyst method and 3 catalystless method, each being a polycondensation method described below was dissolved in about 20 ml of dichloromethane and the solution was poured into 1,000 ml of hot water at about 60 C with stirring, whereby the dichloromethane was evaporated and the high molecular polymer came up to the surface. The latter was collected and dried under reduced pressure for drying and solvent removal to give the desired high molecular polymer. The polymer obtained was placed in a closed vessel and stored at room temperature. For stability evaluation, the thus stored sample was subjected to GPC gel permeation chromatography for average molecular weight determination. As shown by the results given in Table 1, marked improvement in stability was noted with the high molecular polymers obtained in accordance with the invention and having low free monomer acid contents. In preparing the lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers used in the above, the following methods were used In 800 mg of distilled water were dissolved with warming 450 mg of leuprolide the acetate of a poly peptide having the formula Pyr Glu His Trp Ser Tyr D Leu Leu Arg Pro NH CH₂CH₃ and having luteinizing hormone releasing hormone LH RH like activity, wherein the abbreviations according to the IUPAC IUB Commission on Bio chemical Nomenclature are used, the amino acids, unless otherwise specified, being in the L form and 40 mg of gelatin internal water phase . Separately, 3.5 g of each of the lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers of Reference Example 1, Lot Nos. 2 1, 2 2, 3 1 and 3 3, was dissolved in 5 ml of methylene chloride oil phase . The oil phase was added to the water phase with stirring using Polytron Kinematica, Switzerland to give a w o emulsion. The viscosity at 15 C of the w o emulsions derived from Lot No. 2 2 and No. 3 2 was 2,000. Separately, 200 ml of a 0.5 aqueous solution of polyvinyl alcohol was prepared. To this was added the w o emulsion with stirring using an Autohomomixer Tokushu Kika, Japan , whereby a w o w emulsion was produced. This emulsion was stirred with a propeller in a nitrogen stream for about 2 hours to thereby evaporate off the dichloromethane and to solidify the oil phase. The thus formed microcapsules were collected by filtration, rinsed with water and dried. In 2 ml of dichloromethane and 7 ml of distilled water were dissolved 50 mg of the microcapsules obtained in the powder form, and the leuprolide concentration in the distilled water was determined by reversed phase HPLC and the content of leuprolide incorporated into the microcapsules was calculated. Said content is given in Table 2 in terms of percentage to the theoretical content. As is evident from Table 2, the use of the high molecular polymers obtained by the method of the invention gave higher rates of leuprolide incorporation. The microcapsules prepared in Reference Example 2 were weighed in 50 mg portions and each portion was dispersed in 10 ml of phosphate buffer pH 7.0 . The release of leuprolide from the microcapsules into the buffer was measured by stirring each dispersion at 25 rpm in a constant temperature vessel maintained at 37 C. With the leuprolide content as found in Reference Example 2 taken as the initial value, residual leuprolide percentages to the initial value were determined by subjecting the filtrates obtained after separation of microcapsules by filtration after storage at 37 C for 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days to HPLC for determination of residual leuprolide. The percentage values thus obtained are shown in Fig. 1. The data shown in Fig. 1 clearly indicate that the use of the high molecular polymers according to the present invention reduced the initial burst release by one day and allowed leuprolide release of approximately zero order over 1 1.5 months. In Fig. 1, is for the high molecular polymer of Lot No. 2 1, for the high molecular polymer of Lot No. 2 2, o for the high molecular polymer of Lot No. 3 1 and for the high molelcular polymer of Lot No. 3 2. A high molecular polymer was synthesized in the same manner as in Reference Example 1, method 3 . The free acid content was found to be 0.021 mole per 100 g of the high molecular polymer obtained. A high molecular polymer was produced by weighing 191 g of 85 aqueous lactic acid solution, 17.5 g of glycolic acid and 6.8 g of Dowex 50W and following the procedure of Reference Example 1, method 1 . After removal of the water distilled, the reaction was performed at 3 mmHg and 175 C for 72 hours. In this case, the free acid content was 0.018 mole per 100 g of the high molecular polymer obtained. By following the procedure of Reference Example 1, method 3 , 150 g of 85 aqueous lactic acid solution was treated and the water distilled was removed. Thereafter, the reaction was further conducted at 3 mmHg and 175 C for 12 hours to give a high molecular polymer. In this case, the free acid content was 0.035 mole per 100 g of the high molecular polymer obtained. The polylactic acid glycolic acid obtained in Reference Example 4 by the catalystless method and having a lactic acid glycolic acid ratio of 75 25 and an average molecular weight of 13,000 was dissolved in dichloromethane, and the solution was poured into hot water at about 60 C with stirring, whereupon a high molecular polymer came up to the surface. This was collected and dried. The thus obtained copolymer had a lactic acid glycolic acid ratio of 75 25, a molecular weight of 13,000 and a free acid content of 0.005 mole per 100 g of the high molecular polymer. Its inherent viscosity was 0.15 as determined in chloroform at a concentration of 0.5 . The polylactic acid glycolic acid synthesized in Reference Example 5 using Dowex 50W as a catalyst and having a lactic acid glycolic acid ratio of 90 10 and an average molecular weight of 20,000 was dissolved in acetone, and the solution was poured into warm water at about 40 C, whereupon a high molecular polymer came up to the surface. The polymer was collected and dried. The copolymer thus obtained had a free acid content of 0.008 mole per 100 g of the high molecular polymer and an inherent viscosity of 0.48 as determined in chloroform at a concentration of 0.5 . The polylactic acid synthesized in Reference Example 6 without a catalyst and having an average molecular weight of 8,000 was finely pulverized and then treated in warm water at 50 C for 20 minutes with stirring, followed by filtration and drying. The thus obtained high molecular compound had a free acid content of 0.009 mole per 100 g thereof and an inherent viscosity of 0.10 as determined in chloroform. The same high molecular polymer as used in Example 1 was rinsed in a 1 1 mixture of water and ethanol at 50 C and then treated in the same manner as in Example 1. The high molecular polymer obtained had a free acid content of 0.0028 mole per 100 g of the high molecular polymer. In dichloromethane oil phase 3 g of lactic acid glycolic acid copolymer obtained in Reference Example 4 having a lactic acid glycolic acid ratio of 75 25 and an average molecular weight of 13,000 was dissolved. 60 mg of thyroid hormone releasing hormone tartarate TRH T was dissolved in 800 mg of water inner water phase . The oil phase was added to the inner water phase with stirring using Polytron to give a w o emulsion. After cooling at 15 C, the w o emulsiuon was added to 200 ml of 0.5 aqueous solution of polyvinyl alcohol, separately prepared and cooled at 15 C, with stirring using an Autohomomixer to give a w o w emulsion. This emulsion was stirred with a propeller in a nitrogen stream for about 2 hours to thereby cause evaporation of the dichhoromethane and solidification of the oil phase. The thus formed microcapsules were collected by filtration, rinsed with water and dried to form a powder.
