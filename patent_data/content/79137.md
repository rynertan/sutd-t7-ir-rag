# Computer numeric control for metal forming.

## Abstract
A computer numeric control for metal forming which allows the automatic selecting of gauge position and ram position allowing both variables to act to produce bends in forming materials with different flange lengths and angles. The system also offers programming and calibration fea tures comprising signtficant improvements over prior art apparatus and methods. The system integrates the press control circuitry and all precise control of flange length which can be programmed and offers precise control of the bend angle which can be programmed. Multiple programs can be stored and later retrieved. The apparatus can be calibrated in either Imperial or metric units. Magnetic cassettes and printers can be utilized for permanent storage of programs and to produce permanent records on paper.
