# Density correcting method and apparatus for subtraction image.

## Abstract
In an energy subtraction processing for radiation images conducted by use of stimulable phosphor sheets, a character istic value of a difference signal obtained by a subtraction pro cessing of digital image signals detected from the stimulable phosphor sheets carrying radiation images stored therein is calculated. When the difference signal is subjected to a grada tion processing, the characteristic value is made to corre spond to a predetermined density of a reproduced image by uniformly converting the difference signal or by correcting a gradation conversion table used for the gradation processing.
