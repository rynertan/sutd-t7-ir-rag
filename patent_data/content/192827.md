# Screening for filament packages.

## Abstract
An automatic filament winding machine has chucks mounted one above the other on respective swing arms. The chucks are movable alternatively from respective rest positions into a winding position. A screen is movable into an operating position to prevent a thread tail on a package carried by the upper chuck becoming entangled with a packaged forming on the lower chuck.
