# High frequency semiconductor device on an insulating substrate.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device comprising a conductive layer 61 an insulating layer 62 mounted on the conductive layer and having an opening terminals 64B, 64C, 64E deposited on the insulating layer an active semiconductor element 3 mounted on the conductive layer or the insulating layer, and a capacitor 7 mounted on the conductive layer. In this device, a path between the semiconductor element and the capacitor is very short and the conductive layer serves as a heat sink.
