# Radiation shielding structures.

## Abstract
An easily assembled wall or enclosure to shield techni cians against radiation comprises a plurality of intercon nected panels 10 . Each panel 10 has a lead core 11 surrounded by resin impregnated glass fiber layers 14 , 16 . The panels 10 are releasably connected through flanges 17 integrally formed with the core covering layers 14 , 16 . Filler bodies 31 , also covered with fiberglass resin 15 , are located on the cores 11 to form edge recesses which in adjacent panels 10 cooperate to form a depression 29 into which is fitted an auxiliary panel 24 . The auxiliary panel 24 has its own lead core 25 which bridges the junction between the cores 11 of adjacent panels 10 .
