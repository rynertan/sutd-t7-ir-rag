B. Hwang et al., journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol.260, 15639 1985 . Further tetrahydrofuran derivatives which are not described as PAF antagonists are disclosed in US B 3769350 A.F.A. Wallis et al., journal of the Chemical Society, Perkin Transactions C, 1869 1973 R. Stevenson et al., Tetrahedron, 285 1977 and Chemical Abstracts, Vol.79, No.23, 361, Abstract No.136925 u 1973 . The compounds of the present invention are specific PAF antagonists, They are similar to a subclass of compounds called lignans which characteristically contain two phenylpropyl groups bonded at the β carbon. Tetrahydrofuran THF derivatives can exist in eight different stereoisomers as shown in Scheme I. We have been able to prepare all the possible isomers of the tetrahydrofuran lignan analogs with different substituents and found that activity is stereospecific. Accordingly, it is the object of the present invention to prepare the most potent isomers of novel tetrahydrofuran derivatives as PAF antagonists which can be used for the treatment of various diseases including prevention of platelet aggregation, hypotension, inflammation, asthma, lung edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome, various shock syndromes, cardiovascular disorders and other related skeletal muscular disorders. Another object of the present invention is to develop processes for the preparation of each and every stereoisomer of the 2,5 diaryltetrahydrofuran analogs. A further object of the present invention is to provide acceptable pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more of the tetrahydrofuran derivatives and or analogs as the active ingredient. As PAF antagonists, these novel compositions should be effective in the treatment of various skeletal muscular related diseases. A therapeutically sufficient amount of these PAF antagonists can be used to treat a patient suffering from various skeletal muscular disorders including inflammation, e.g., osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and gout, hypotension, shock, psoriasis, allergic or skin diseases, asthma, pain especially dental pain, peptic or stomach ulcer, lung edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome or cardiovascular disorders. This invention relates to PAF antagonists of the structural formula wherein R and R¹ independently are wherein each R² independently represents hydrogen, or C₁ ₆ alkyl and Ar¹ is The following compounds are preferred The compounds of the invention can exist in the eight isomers as described in Scheme I. These various isomers bear a close relationship to the PAF antagonistic activity observed for the compounds within the scope of this invention. Preferably, the PAF antagonists of this invention are of structural formula or an enantiomer thereof wherein Ar and Ar¹ are as previously defined. Even more preferably, the compounds of this invention are of structural formula wherein Ar, R⁴, R⁶ and Y are as previously defined. A further object of the invention is a compound which is defined as follows The PAF antagonists of this invention have been prepared largely by stereospecific reactions from diaroylbutanes, bromo ferulic acid derivatives, substituted phenyl vinyl ketones or styrene derivatives as indicated in the following schemes. If necessary, appropriate modification of the starting materials will lead to compounds of the invention. As shown above in schemes 1 to 5 , most of the tetrahydrofuran PAF antagonists of this invention have been prepared from 1,4 diaryl 1,4 diketones by a two step reaction which involves reduction of the diketones to 1,4 diols followed by cyclization to the desired tetrahydrofurans. The 1,4 diketones required to make the tetrahydrofurans were made by three different routes. In the first method, sodium, lithium, potassium or other metal generated from aryl ketones and a base such as sodium hydride, potassium hydride, sodium amide, n butyl lithium, or lithium diisopropylamide were alkylated with α bromo ketones or 2 iodoketones. This reaction could be carried out in various solvents such as anhydrous ether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide or liquid ammonia at 78 C to 50 C. The second method of preparing 1,4 diketones involves the coupling of the metal enolates described above by using copper and iron salts such as cupric chloride, cupric triflate, ferric or ferrous chloride. A third method of preparing 1,4 diketones involves the reaction of an aryl aldehyde with an aryl vinyl ketone in the presence of a base such as triethylamine catalyzed by cyanide ion or thiazolium halides. This reaction could be done conveniently in solvents such as ethanol and dimethyl formamide at 25 80 C. Reduction of 1,4 diketones was carried out either catalytically by using hydrogen as the reducing agent or by using metal hydride reducing agents. In the later case, one can use the usual reducing agents such as lithium aluminum hydride in solvents such as ether or tetrahydrofuran or sodium borohydride in methanol, ethanol or similar solvents. These reductions could be carried out at 30 to 50 C by stirring the substrate and the reducing agent dissolved in a solvent for 15 minutes to 24 hours. Alternatively, the 1,4 diketones could be reduced catalytically by using hydrogen and the usual catalysts such as palladium, platinum, rhodium or nickel in various solvents such as methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, acetic acid, ethyl acetate or benzene. Other acidic, basic or neutral low boiling solvents could also be used for the same purpose. The reaction mixture could be rendered acidic by using the usual mineral and organic acids such as hydrochloride, sulfuric, perchloric, trifluoroacetic or acetic acids. The reaction mixture could also be rendered basic by using the usual inorganic and organic bases such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or triethylamine. The reduction could be carried out by stirring the substrate and the catalyst under hydrogen gas at 2.76 103.4 bar 40 1500 p.s.i. for 15 minutes to 24 hours at 25 100 C. Cyclization of 1,4 diols to tetrahydrofurans was effected by stirring the diols with methane sulfonyl chloride triethylamine, triphenylphosphine dibromide or trifluoroacetic acid in solvents such as methylene chloride, acetonitrile or chloroform. The reaction is conducted at 30 C to 50 C for 5 minutes to 4 hours. Alternatively, the 1,4 diols could be cyclized to tetrahydrofurans by heating the diols at 0 50 C above their melting points in the presence of catalytic amounts .01 4 of palladium, platinum and or copper salts. The preferred metal salts are platinum chloride, platinum acetate, copper acetate and copper nitrate. The tetrahydrofuran PAF antagonists of this invention could also be made from aryl propene or cinnamic acid derivatives either by chemical oxidative coupling reactions, or by using ferric chloride in solvents such as acetone, or enzymatically by using peroxidases such as horseradish peroxidase in solvents such as aqueous acetone. The above reactions are usually carried out at 0 40 C for 1 14 days. This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the PAF antagonists of the invention as the active constituents and a carrier and can be used for the treatment of patients or mammalian animals raised in the dairy, meat, or fur industries or as pets suffering from disorders or diseases which can be attributed to PAF as previously described. Accordingly, the compounds of the invention can be used among other things to reduce pain and inflammation, to correct respiratory, cardiovascular, and intravascular alterations or disorders, and to regulate the activation or coagulation of platelets, to correct hypotension during shock, the pathogenesis of immune complex deposition and smooth muscle contractions. For the treatment of inflammation such as rhumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and eye inflammation, cardio vascular disorder, asthma, shock syndrome or other diseases mediated by the PAF, the compounds of the invention may be administered orally, topically, parenterally, by inhalation spray or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles.

Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono or or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. The compounds of the invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, containing the compounds of the invention are employed. Dosage levels of the order of from about 0.1 mg to about 140 mg per kilogram of body weight per day are useful in the treatment of the above indicated conditions about 0.5 mg to about 7 gms. per patient per day . For example, inflammation may be effectively treated by the administration of from about 0.01 to 50 mg of the compound per kilogram of body weight per day about 1.0 mg to about 3.5 gms per patient per day . The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a formulation intended for the oral administration of humans may contain from 0.5 mg to 5 gm of active agent compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition. Dosage unit forms will generally contain between from about 1 mg to about 500 mg of an active ingredient. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy. It has been found that the compounds of the invention exhibit The inhibition of H³ PAF binding to the rabbit platelet plasma membrane by a PAF antagonist of the invention was determined by a method employing isotopic labeling and filtration techniques.
