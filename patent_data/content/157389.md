# Protection device for a MOS transistor.

## Abstract
A semiconductor integrated circuit includes a MOS transistor TR13 , and a transistor circuit TR14, R1 in which one end of a current path is connected to a drain of this MOS transistor TR13 and which has a breakdown voltage lower than an avalanche breakdown voltage of the MOS transistor TR13 .
