# Automatic background brightness control device for colour sorting apparatus.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an automatic background brightness control device for colour sorting apparatus hav ing a plurality of sorting channels Q1 Qn , each including a sensor S1 Sn to detect the amount of reflected and or transmitted light from objects to be sorted and the amount of reflected and or transmitted light from a background pro vided at the sorting channel. A scanner circuit means 12, 14, 16 selects from the sorting channels one sorting channel of which the background brightness is to be controlled. A process control means 11 is provided to compare the output from the sensor against a predetermined reference voltages and to produce a signal for controlling the back ground brightness only when the output from the sensor deviates from the reference voltages. A light control means P1 Pn controls the background brightness within the selected sorting channel according to the signal for controll ing the background brightness.
