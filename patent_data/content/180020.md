# PLASMA ETCHING SYSTEM

## Abstract
It has been discovered surprisingly that when a plasma is produced by exciting a gas or mixture of gages with microwaves and simultaneously also with a radio frequency electrical discharge, that the resulting plasma is much more highly chemically reactive than a plasma produced instead by only one of the excitations. Such a plasma etches a surface much faster than the sum of the etch rates produced by each of the excitations individually and the etching aniso tropy may be controlled by varying the ration of the applied power of each of the two kinds of simultaneous excitation. Sample to be etched are mounted on electrode 30 within the reaction chamber 26 of the vessel 24, 28 and a RF field is established between the electrode and the base 36 by high frequency generator 50. A microwave cavity 10 loosely surrounds the vessel 24, 28 which is formed of material which is permeable to the frequency of the genera tor 14. A suitable plasma forming gas from source 32 flows through vessel 24, 28 to vacuum pump 44. As the gas passes cavity 10 it is excited and forms a microwave plasma which impinges against the samples 46 and etches them. The RF field greatly enhances the rate of etching.
