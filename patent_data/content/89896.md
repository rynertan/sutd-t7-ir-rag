# A RASTER AND STROKE WRITING DEFLECTION AMPLIFIER ARRANGEMENT

## Abstract
A raster and stroke writing deflection amplifier arrange ment for a cathode ray tube CRT is disclosed which uses a conventional vertical oscillator and vertical deflection ampli fier 15 and a conventional horizontal oscillator and synchro nous horizontal deflection amplifier 11 , both driving deflec tion coils 26, 27 for providing vertical and low power horizontal scan operation for raster scan writing of data, and a flyback transformer 42 and rectifier 43 for providing the high D.C. voltage required by the CRT anode by rectification of high surge voltages created during horizontal retrace periods. During each vertical retrace period a switch 28, 29, 39 connects the synchronous horizontal deflection amplifier to a dummy yoke 25 at a zero crossing of the horizontal deflection signal for uninterrupted operation, connects a source of horizontal stroke writing signals amplified by a linear amplifier 10 to the deflection coil 19 , and also connects a source of vertical stroke writing signals to the vertical deflection amplifier 15 to drive the deflection coil 14 to accomplish stroke writing of information during each vertical retrace period.
