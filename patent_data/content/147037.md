# Apparatus for measuring the pitch between adjacent rods in a nuclear fuel assembly.

## Abstract
In apparatus for measuring the pitch between adjacent rods in a row of spaced apart rods 3 in a nuclear fuel assembly 5 at selected points along the length of the rods, the fuel assembly is relatively positioned angularly about its longitudinal centre line with respect to a wand 8 position able to any selected point along the length of the rods. The wand 8 carries two spaced apart, non contact proximity sensors 12 and is transversely moved along the row of rods 3 . An output signal of unique value is generated when the sensors 12 are equally distant from a rod or adjacent rods. Means is provided for measuring the distance between the occurrence of alternate unique signals as a measure of the pitch between adjacent rods.
