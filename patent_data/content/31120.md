## Description
A process for the production of 2 substituted 6 alkoxycarbonyl 8 ethyl 5 oxo 5, 8 dihydro pyrido 2 3 d7 pyrimidines and of corresponding free acids. The present invention relates to a novel process for the production of 2 substituted 6 alkoxycarbonyl 8 ethyl 5 oxo 5, 8 dihydro pyrido 2, 3 d7 pyrimidines and their free acids, having the following general formula EMI1.1 wherein R1 H, CH3, C2H5 2 Cl, CH3 O, C2H 5 CH 3 CH3SO2 as well as their use in the condensation with secundary amines for the preparation of compounds having a relevant bacteriostatic activity, such as the pyromidic and the pipemidic acids.As a matter of fact, the compounds of the class A constitute, as it is known from the prior art, useful intermediates for the production of the afore said acids and the several processes, as used up to date for their production, consisted in reacting the corresponding 5, 6, 7, 8 tetrahydroderivatives with a halogen, preferably bromine, a in the elimination of a molecule of the corresponding hydrogen halide by means of a tertiary amino base, preferably triethylamine.According to further suggested processes, the used of quinone reactants, such as chloranile is foreseen, without any advantage from the point of view of the industrial process.It has been now found that the 5, 6, 7, 8 tetrahydroderivatives can be dehydrogenated to the corresponding compounds of general formu la A by means of a group of oxidizing compounds, which are less expenSive, give place to very high yields and require for their in dustrial use a less sophisticated and safer technology with respect to that needed for the use of bromine or of other halogens.These oxidizing compounds, which act according to a mechanism different from that of the halogens, are for instance alkaline dichroma tes, alkaline permanganates, manganese dioxide, nitric acid.Their action takes directly place in solution or suspension, which is preferably neutral or.made acidic by the addition of acetic acid and aqueous acetic acid, or of diluted mineral acids, directly leading to desired product without using other reactants, as it was necessary in the case of using bromine or sulfuryl chloride which then required triethylamine as the acceptor of hydrogen halide in Ã…a subse quent step.Thus, according to the process of the present invention, a compound having the general formula B EMI2.1 R1 H, CH3, C2H5 R2 Cl, CH3O, C2H5 CH3S, CH3SO2 is reacted with an oxidizing compound, preferably selected among dichromates and permanganates of alkali metals, manganese dioxide and nitric acid, the reaction being carried out in hot conditions until the conversion is completed.More particularly, the 6 carbethoxy 8 ethyl 2 ethoxy 5 oxo 5, 8 dihX dro pyrido l 2, 3 d7 pyrimidine I has been found to be especially useful for the preparation with high yields of the above mentioned acids.It is thus prepared, according to the present invention, from 6 etho xycarbonyl 8 ethyl 2 ethoxy 5 oxo 5, 6,7, 8 tetrahydro pyrido g2, 3 d7 pyrimidine II , according to the following scheme EMI3.1 In turn, the compound II is prepared in two steps, according to the prior art, starting from 2 ethoxy 4 chloro 5 carbethoxy pyrimidine, which is condensed with ethyl 3 ethylamino propionate in the presen cP of an acid acceptor and then cyclized in the presence of alkaline alcoliolates. The following examples illustrate the invention, without having limi ting meaning.EXAMPLE 1Preparation of 2 methoxy 5 oxo 6 carbethoxy 8 ethyl 5, 8 dihydro pyri do 2, 3 d pyrimidine.5 grams of 2 methoxy 5 oxo 6 carbethoxy 5, 6, 7, 8 tetrahydro pyrido 2,3 d pyrimidine are hot dissolved in 100c.c. of tolueneThe solution is added with 5 g of manganese dioxide and the mixture is refluxed for 8 hours.

Yield 989 From the preceding examples it is clear that, by means of the process of the present invention, it is possible, once the oxidizing agent and the solvent are carefully selected, to prepare the compounds of formula A either as esters and as free acids more particularly, the former are obtained when the oxidizing agent is manganese dioxide or an alkaline dichromate and the solvent is acetic acid aqueous or diluted , or a mineral acid also in diluted form , such as for instance sulphuric acid. It is important when the intermediate A serves for further reactions, in which the form of free acid might be an obstacle with respect to an easy occurrence of the next step.
