# Self tensioning printing cylinder lock.

## Abstract
A self tensioning printing cylinder lock for fitting longitudinally in grooves 121 formed between printing saddles 123 on diametrically opposite sides of a printing press cylinder 25 . Such lock includes a longitudinally extending base plate 21 having a longitudinally elongated tensioning bar 23 disposed in overlying relationship with respect thereto. The opposite extremities of such bar are urged toward an extended position away from the saddle edge by a pair of identical springs 31 to thus maintain such bar to a position aligned longitudinally with the print ing cylinder as a result of such biased spring tension. Con sequently, as the length of such printing plate mounted on the saddle varies during operation, the tensioning bar will draw the transversely opposite sides of such printing plate toward such extended position with uniform force to maintain the plate tensioned irrespective of variation in plate length.
