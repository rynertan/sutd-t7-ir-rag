# Method of producing an optical information recording medium.

## Abstract
An optical information recording medium is produced by introducing a plasma generation gas comprising hydro carbon into a plasma generating region 12 provided with a metal target 20 and a substrate 22 . The pressure of the plasma generating gas is maintained within a predetermined range within the plasma generating region 12 . Electrical power is applied to the plasma generating gas to dissociate the gas thereby forming a plasma. The generated plasma sputters the metal target 20 , thereby allowing the sputtered metal to be deposited on the substrate 22 in the form of a film containing the metal and the carbon liberated from the hydrocarbon. During sputtering, the product between the density of the power applied to the electrode 14 and the average residence time of the plasma generating gas within the plasma generating region 12 is controlled within such that the product falls within the range of more than 0.5 W sec cm² and less than 50 W sec cm², and the partial pressure of a secondary hydrocarbon, which is different from the introduced hydrocarbon, present during the dissociation to the secondary hydrocarbon before the dissociation and after the introduction is set to range between 2 and 12.
