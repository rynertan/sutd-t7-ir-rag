# INERTIAL COMPENSATOR DEVICE AND METHOD

## Abstract
A method and device for compensating on looms in run ning condition the effect of variable moments acting on mov able component part members of such looms. The method consists in generating a variation of the moment of inertia of at least one rotating mass mechanically linked to the movable component part members, the variations being in operative and time correlation with the variable moments. The device consists in a compensator comprising two masses arranged radially and symmetrical to each other, the masses being displaceable radially and symmetrically to each other and arranged to follow while rotating the profile of a cam through a rolling contact wheel.
