# Optically active pyridobenzoxazine derivatives.

## Abstract
An optically action pyridobenzoxazine derivative, a pro cess for preparing the same and a novel intermediate use ful for preparing the optically active pyridobenzoxazine de rivative are disclosed. The optically active pyridobenzoxa zine derivative possesses increased antimicrobial activity and reduced toxicity. The intermediate is useful for prepar ing such optically active pyridobenzoxazine derivatives such as Ofloxacin and anolog compounds.
