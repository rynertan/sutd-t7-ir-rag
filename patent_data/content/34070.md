# Fault tolerant memory system.

## Abstract
Block redundancy is utilized to improve yield and lower die cost for an electrically programmable read only memory EPROM . The EPROM is organised 8K x8 with four primary memory blocks 12A, 12B, 12C, 12D on each side of a central row decoder 14. Each block includes an array M of memory cells, column select CS column decode CD, sense amp SA, data buffer DB and other overhead circuitry. One block of redundant circuitry 12RB 1 is also provided for each set of four blocks and includes a redundant memory matrix RM, a redundant column decoder RCD, a redundant column se lect RCS, a redundant sense amplifier RSA and a redundant data buffer RDB, incorporated within each primary memory block is a multiplex logic circuit 26 MUX which is indepen dently programmabie to selectively disconnect the associ ated primary memory block and substitute the redundant memory block, including the redundant column decoder, column select, sense amp and data buffer. Each multiplex logic circuit 26 includes a polysilicon fuse which is perma nently programmable from a closed to an open circuit condition by applying a high voltage to the external data bit terminal P1, P2, ... which corresponds to the defective memory block.
