# HYPERBOLOID OF REVOLUTION FLUID DRIVEN TENSION ACTUATORS AND METHOD OF MAKING

## Abstract
A fluid driven tension actuator has a pair of end connection, ring shaped fittings of relatively large internal diameter with multiple inextensible strands anchored to them and initially extending between them as straight lines oriented at a pitch angle in the range from 60 to 120 forming a network of tension elements constraining the actuator shell and connecting together said two end fit tings. These tension element strands define a ruled surface having the shape of an hyperboloid of revolution when the actuator is in its initially deflated elongated or extended position. These tension element strands serve to constrain the resilient, flexible, stretchable, elastomeric shell of the actuator which stretches and bulges outwardly into nearly a spherical surface of revolution when the actuator is in its inflated contracted or retracted position. By virtue of the relatively large internal diameter of the two end fittings there is provided at least one unrestricted port through which fluid can readily pass for efficient operation at a high cyclic rate of operation. In one embodiment, there is a single central crossing point of the respective strand ele ments and this crossing point stabilizes the strands during cyclic inflation and deflation of the tension actuator.
