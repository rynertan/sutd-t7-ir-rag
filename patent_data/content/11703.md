# Magnetic composite structure and method for making said structure.

## Abstract
A composite mechanically stabilized, magnetic shield is provided which comprises a superposed layer adhesively bonded to a glassy metal alloy sheet e.g. ribbon or fabric . Further, a procedure for providing mechanical stabilization for glassy metal alloy sheet is provided by bonding a super posed layer adhesively to the sheet. The construction results in a composite having a high degree of flexibility or rigidity. The adhesively bonded sheet prevents the glassy metal alloy ribbons or fabric from fraying when subjected to flexing and torsioning or handling. The stabilized magnetic shields are useful as electromagnetic shields in electronics and com munications.
