# Flow regulator valve.

## Abstract
A demand responsive flow regulator valve for use with a power steering pump 10 and steering mechanism 14 has a valve spool 24 slidably disposed in a housing 21 and responsive to a pressure differential across an orifice 40 for the purpose of bypassing excess pump flow. The flow control orifice establishes pressure signals proportional to pump flow to the steering mechanism. The pressure signals are operative on the valve spool to control the bypassing of excess pump flow. A spring loaded metering rod 48 disposed in the flow control orifice increases the effective area of the orifice when pressure demand at the steering mechanism increases, thereby increasing the fluid flow to the steering mechanism while simultaneously decreasing the bypass flow.
