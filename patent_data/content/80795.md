# Controlled current solenoid driver circuit.

## Abstract
A solenoid driver circuit 10 for a solenoid operated fluid dispenser in which a valve 12 is operable to dispense a fluid under the control of the solenoid 21 . The driver circuit 10 receives externally applied turn on and turn off signals and energizes the solenoid 21 in response to these signals. The driver circuit 10 is responsive to a turn on signal to couple a pull in voltage across the solenoid 21 to pull in a solenoid valve armature 17 . The driver circuit 10 is also operable to sense the level of current in the solenoid 21 . When the solenoid current reaches a preset peak current level, the pull in voltage is removed from the solenoid 21 and replaced by a hold in voltage. When the hold in voltage is applied to the solenoid 21 , the driver circuit 10 is operable to control the level of the hold in voltage in order to maintain a preselected hold in current in the solenoid 21 . The driver circuit 10 controls the solenoid current so that it makes a gradual transition from the peak solenoid current level to a steady state hold in current level. The voltage applied to the solenoid 21 to establish the steady state hold in current is removed by the driver circuit 10 in response to an externally applied turn off signal.
