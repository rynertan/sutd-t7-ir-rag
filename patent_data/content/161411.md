## Description
This invention relates to the production of organophilic clay gellants suitable for use to thicken organic liquids such as, for example, oil based drilling minds, or for the production of greases. The production of organophilic clays by ion exchange of onium compounds onto clays has long been known. The maximum loading of onium compound onto a clay by ion exchange is strictly limited by the ion exchange capacity of the clay and, as a result, organophilic clay derivatives made by this route were relatively limited in performance. For this reason attempts have been made to increase the quantity of onium compounds in organophilic clay gellants to a level above that allowed for by ion exchange. British Patent No. 1592271 discloses a process for preparing over treated organophilic clay gellants in solid form in which the over treatment is limited to an excess of from 12 to 25 above the cation exchange capacity of the clay. According to that process, reaction with the clay is conducted in a medium comprising a mixture of water and a polar organic solvent, in a solvent to water ratio of from 1 20 to 2 1, and in a quantity which produces an easily stirrable colloidal suspension from which the organophilic product is recovered by filtration, washing and drying. It is reported that the products so obtained have inherently better gelling properties when the reaction is carried out in the mixture of polar organic solvent and water rather than in water alone. UK Patent Specification No. 2108175 discloses the production of an organophilic clay gellant by stirring a slurry of the clay, from 90 to 140 milliequivalents of quaternary ammonium compounds by weight of the clay and water for a sufficient time for the quaternary compound to react followed by filtering, washing, drying and grinding the product so obtained. The present invention provides a process for the production of an organophilic clay gellant containing one or more onium compounds in a quantity in excess of that corresponding to the cation exchange capacity of the clay by treating a swelling clay with the said quantity of an onium compound in the presence of a liquid comprising a polar organic solvent characterised in that any quantity of water which is present is not more than that which would be provided in total by a content of water in the clay of up to 15 by weight and in the onium compound of less than 10 by weight and in the organic solvent of no more than 20 by weight, and in that the quantity of the polar organic solvent is such that a non flowable paste or a particulate solid mass results from the mixing and in that the paste or solid particulate mass is subjected to sufficient shear mixing to raise the temperature of the non flowable paste or solid mass, the temperature of mixing being above 50 By non flowable is meant not flowing under its own weight. The swelling clays which are used in putting the present invention into practice may be selected from the smectite family of clay minerals. Smectites may be defined as a group of clay minerals or phyllosilicates of the 2 1 layer type with the general formulae The swelling clays are used according to the present invention in the dry flowable form. This implies the absence of a separate liquid phase. Such clays may contain up to about 15 by weight of adsorbed moisture. as measured by weight loss on drying at 110 Suitably, the swelling clays are used as a milled product having a particle size less than 251 microns, preferably less than 150 microns. The cation exchange capacity of the swelling clays may fall in the broad range of about 30 m.e. to 100 m.e. 100 g clay, but is preferably at least 50, particularly preferably at least 60 m.e. 100 g clay on a dehydrated clay basis 0 adsorbed moisture . Cation exchange capacities are expressed on this same basis hereafter. The term onium is used herein to mean organic ammonium compounds and isologues thereof having the formula R The polar organic solvent preferably has a theoretical boiling point of at least 65 Onium compounds may be available in a small quantity of a polar organic solvent as, for example, a 75 by weight active product. Such materials may be used as such. Some such materials may contain a minor proportion of water. Provided that this content of water is less than 10 , preferably no more than 5 , by weight, it can be tolerated. The quantity of polar organic solvent is preferably such that the onium compound, when mixed with it, may form a fluid material, for example a solution, which may be mixed with clay. The quantity of onium compound to be used in excess of the quantity corresponding to the cation exchange capacity of the clay will affect the quantity of polar organic solvent used. It is found that very large excesses of onium compound may be included with the clay according to this invention, for example up to 200 or more, of the quantity corresponding to the cation exchange capacity of the clay. If the cation exchange capcity of the clay is relatively low, for example below about 60 m.e. 100 g it may be found that these values may be greatly exceeded. The gelling performance of the material, however, may be at an optimum between 130 and 180 excess. Wtihin the practical guidelines that the mixture of the clay, and onium compound should be a non flowable paste or a solid particulate mass and that the quantity of the polar organic solvent should be controlled to achieve this, the quantity of polar organic solvent may be, for example, at least about 10 and, for example, less than 30 by weight of the onium compound. Preferably the polar organic solvent, itself, contains substantially no water although the addition of a restricted quantity of water, for example up to 10 by weight, or even up to 20 by weight would not be held to be a departure from the invention. Preferably no non polar organic solvent is present. Besides the teaching set out above as to the quantity of water which may be present, which contrasts with previous belief that the presence of a separate water phase is beneficial in the formation of organophlic clay derivatives, the present invention is also characterised by conditions under which the mixture of clay, onium compound and polar organic solvent is processed. According to the invention the mixture is subjected to shear. Shear mixers are known in the art of clay processing and operate on the principle of causing relative movement between the clay particles within the body of the clay mass. Such equipment is contrasted herein with milling equipment, such as a ball mill, which tends to reduce the particle size of the clay by crushing between moving equipment members. Preferably the shear mixer is a Z blade mixer or a plough shear mixer, e.g. by Lodige Morton. Shear mixing according to the invention is characterised by an increase in temperature in the material being mixed although this increase is generally quite modest, e.g. less than 5 The conditions of operation of the mixer may suitably be from 30 to 90 revolutions per minute and the normal duration of mixing is preferably at least 30 minutes and may be, for example, up to 2 hours or more although an extension of time may not give any further benefit. After mixing, the organophilic clay product may be used as such, or may be washed with a solvent for the onium compound if it is desired to reduce the content of residual anion associated with the product and or may, preferably, be subjected to heat to drive off the polar organic solvent. Preferably the product from which the solvent has been removed is milled to break up any aggregates formed during the drying, for example to less than 76 microns. Preferably the drying temperature is from 95 As will be apparent from the following examples, the present invention enables highly effective organophilic clay gellants to be produced. It is thought that the processing technique represented by the invention encourages the partial delamination of the clay structure thereby facilitating the intercalation of a large quantity of excess onium compound between the clay layers. In the following examples the Fann viscosity of oil thickened by organophilic clay gellants according to the invention, or by other gellants is measured. The test conditions are as follows The viscosity of the resulting slurry is measured once after 24 hours, on a Fann viscometer operating at 600 rpm. The readings taken are in Fann 600 units. The organophilic clay gellants so tested were produced by the following standard procedure according to the invention Examples 1 5 or the indicated variants on it Examples 6 to 12 which are not according to the invention.
