## Description
PROCESS. FOR THE PREPARATION OF TETRAMISOLE AND NOVEL iNTEiMED lATE S The present invention relates to processes for the preparation of novel aryl substituted nitrogen compounds, and more particularly, it relates to improved processes for the production of pharmaceutically desirable aryl imidazothiazoles, as well as to novel intermediate compounds obtained through such processes. Certain imidazothiazoles have been found to have useful pharmaceutical and veterinary activity. For instance, the synthesis of tetramisole or racemic 2,3,5,6 tetrahydro 6 phenylimidazo 2,1 b thiazole and its pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts is of considerable commercial interest because of the anthelminthic activity of such compounds. The enantiomers of this compound are well known and the laevorotatory isomer is extremely well suited to such uses, as discussed in U. S. Patent 3,463,786. As a consequence of such activity, various syntheses are known. In this connection, there are citedRaeymaekers et al., . Me. Chem. 9, 545 1966 Bakelien et al., Aust J . Chem. 21, 1557 1968 Roy U.S. Patent 3,855,234 McMemin U.S. Patent 3,845,070 and SpicerU.S. Patent 3,726,894. The processes of the present invention comprise reacting an aryl vinyl compound with a halogen in the presence of a nitrile to provide by mesne reaction an imidoyl halide. The halide can be reacted in situ with an aminoether to provide an amidine hydrohalide intermediate which can further be treated to provide deprotonation with a base or excess aminoether to cyclize the hydrohalide and provide an imidazoline. Hydrolysis of the imidazoline can provide a diamine. In a further embodiment of the present invention, the diamine is treated to provide tetramisole by sulfurization and ring closure. The novel intermediate compounds provided by the processes and steps of processes of this invention are disclosed in more detail hereinafter. The vinyl aromatic starting material can be an alkyl substituted or unsubstituted mono or polynuclear aromatic vinyl compound. While alkyl naphthalenes and benzenes can be used to provide the aromatic substituent on the vinyl group, one of the outstanding uses of the claimed processes is for the production of tetramisole.For the production of tetramisole, styreneor vinyl benzene are readily available and inexpensive preferred starting materials. The first step of the processes involves the reaction of the vinyl aromatic compound having the formulaAr CH CH2 I , with a halogen and a nitrile. Ar includes mono and polynuclear aromatics, including phenyl, naphthyl, and the like as well as mono and polyalkyl substituted and mono and polyhalo and nitro aromatic compounds. A particularly preferred aromatic group is phenyl. The desirable halogens for use in practicing the present invention include chlorine, bromine, and iodine.Because of the ease of dispersion, the reaction velocity, and economy, chlorine is a preferred halogen in certain embodiments of the present invention. The nitrile has the formula R1 C N II whereR1 is hydrogen, aromatic, or aliphatic. The desirable aromatic groups are phenyl or substituted phenyl including lower alkyl mono and polysubstituted phenyl, mono and polyhalo phenyl, and the like. A preferred nitrile is benzonitrile. The aliphatic nitrile is desirably a lower alkyl nitrile containing from two to about seven carbon atoms per molecule. The use of longer chain or unsaturated nitriles can complicate the process and increase the cost of the raw materials without any concomitant benefit. It is especially desirable to utilize the lower nitriles, such as acetonitrile and, as taught above, benzonitrile in certain preferred embodiments of the invention. R1 can also be hydrogen. This step of the reaction is carried out at temperatures ranging from slightly above room temperature to relatively lower temperatures. The desirable temperature range for use in connection with this step is from about 20tC to about 300C. Moreover, the temperature is lowered to freezing or below and then increased to room temperature or somewhat higher after all of the reactants have been combined. The reaction can be carried out in the presence of an inert vehicle, such as alkyl or aromatic hydrocarbons or halogenated hydrocarbons. The quantities of reactants used for this step can range from stoichiometric up to an excess of the halogen and the nitrile. When the nitrile is present in excess, it can act as a vehicle to assist in moderation and control of the reaction, and this is done in certain preferred embodiments. Generally, it has been found desirable to admix the aromatic vinyl compound and the nitrile and then to introduce the halogen into the mixture. It is also possible to add one or the other of the liquid reactants over a period of time while the halogen is being introduced into the mixture. The time for this step of the process will vary according to the temperature and the particular reactants.Generally, at temperatures at or near OOC, times of one to four hours give g od results. The mixture can then be permitted to rise in temperature, as taught above, and held for another one to four hours. This reaction of nitrile and aromatic vinyl materials provides imidoyl halide compounds having the formula X C R1 N CH Ar CH2 2 X III where R1 and Ar have the meaning set forth above and X is a halo group. Desirable halo groups are bromo, chloro, and iodo, and a particularly preferred halo group is chloro. In certain preferred embodiments, R1 is phenyl or an alkyl group having from one to four carbon atoms. Imido halide Compounds III are useful as intermediates in the preparation of various linear and cyclic materials. Use of Compounds III to provide novel amidines is taught herein. The next reaction according to the present invention is the treatment of the imidoyl halide so formed with specific amines to provide an amidine hydrohalide. The amine is an alkoxyethylamine or the corresponding hydroxyamine, such amines having the formula H2N CH2 CH2 OR2 IV where R2 is hydrogen or an alkyl group. The alkyl groups for use in practicing this process of the invention are lower alkyl groups, desirably those containing from one to four carbon atoms, and in certain preferred embodiments the methoxyethylamine is especially preferred. The amine IV can be added directly to the reaction mixture of the preceding step. The temperature for this stage of the process can range from 200C to 300C. It is generally desirable to add the amine at a temperature of about OOC to 50C or below. The temperature of the reaction mixture is desirably maintained below 200C with cooling during addition of the amine. Thereafter, the temperature can be allowed to rise slowly to achieve improved reaction completeness. The reaction with amine can be carried out in the presence of a vehicle. When excess nitrile has been used in certain preferred embodiments of the invention to produce the imidoyl halide, the nitrile itself with act as a reaction vehicle. Any non nucleophilic solvent inert to hydrogenation, such as saturated hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, ethers, and the like, can be used. Addition of the amine is carried out over a period of time sufficient to permit reaction of the newly added material. In small scale preparations, times of from about 30 minutes to four hours have been found to be desirable.The quantity of amine used is stoichiometric for formation of the amidine hydrohalide or slightly in excess of stoichiometric to provide good reaction completeness. The product produced according to this stage of the reaction is an amidine hydrohalide having the formulaEMI5.1 where Ar, R1, R2, and X have the meaning set forth above. Any excess nitrile can be removed from the product at this point by conventional techniques, such as distillation, vacuum stripping, and the like. If a vehicle other than the nitrile is used, it can also be removed from the amidine at this point.The amidine hydrohalide itself can be purified, if desired, and recovered in a purified form. However, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the amidine can be further treated directly before or after removal of excess nitrile. In certain embodiments of the invention, it is preferred that Ar be phenyl or mono or poly lower alkylsubstituted phenyl, mono or polyhalo including chloro , bromo , fluoro , and iodo or nitro substituted phenyl or polynuclear including naphthyl and phenanthryl R1 is hydrogen, lower alkyl having one to six carbon atoms, or phenyl or alkylphenyl R2 is hydrogen or lower alkyl having from one to four carbon atoms, and X is bromo, chloro, or iodo. In certain particularly preferred embodiments, R1 is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, or phenyl R2 is hydrogen, methyl, or ethyl Ar is phenyl, tolyl, or xylyl, or substituted phenyl, such as nitrophenyl and halophenyl including chloro , bromo , fluoro , and iodo and X is chloro. The novel amidines V have a variety of uses. One especially apt use is in the preparation of imidazoline compounds. The amidine hydrohalide is treated with a base or excess amine to deprotonate it and thereby form an imidazoline ring having the structureEMI5.2 The cyclization of the amidine is carried out at temperatures which provide a satisfactory rate of reaction while avoiding conditions which would be detrimental to the product. Genera lly, it is desirable to use temperatures of from 200C to 500C for the cyclization step. The cyclization is preferably carried out in the presence of an inert reaction vehicle, such as excess nitrile from the imidoyl halide step or in hydrocarbons, including toluene, xylenes, and the like, halogenated hydrocarbons, lower halogenated hydrocarbons having from one to three carbon atoms, such as methylene chloride, ethylene dichloride, and the like being preferred. It has also been found possible according to the present invention to use excess amine with the imidoyl halide to go directly to imidazoline VI. Imidazoline VI has a variety of uses in therapeutics and as an intermediate in various chemical processes.Preferred imidazolines VI have R1 as hydrogen, alkyl containing one to six carbon atoms, phenyl, or alkylphenyl R2 as hydrogen or lower alkyl having one to four carbon atoms Ar as phenyl or mono or lower polyalkyl substituted phenyl and X as bromo, chloro, or iodo In certain especially preferred embodiments, R1 is hydrogen, methyl, ethylor phenyl R2 is hydrogen, methyl, or ethyl Ar is phenyl, tolyl, or xylyl, or nitro or halo substituted aryls, as set forth herein and X is chloro. The next step of the process is treatment of the imidazoline VI with a base or protic source to hydrolyze the cyclic compound to an amidoamine VII having the formula R1CONH CH Ar CH2 NH CH2 2 OR2. R1, R2, Ar, and X have the meaning set forth above. The ring cleavage hydrolysis is carried out at a sufficient temperature to provide reasonable reaction velocity and below the temperature at which undesired further cleavage or side reactions occur. Desirably, a temperature in the range of from about 250 to about 1500C is utilized. The hydrolytic agent used can be water, a base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, or an acid, such as a mineral acid. For reasons of yield and economy, preferred materials are the alkali metal hydroxides, such as aqueous sodium hydroxide, and aqueous mineral acids, such as sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid. Among the acids, a 10 to 50 aqueous hydrochloric acid is preferred, and among the bases, a 10 to 40 aqueous sodium hydroxide is a preferred reagent. Amidoamine VII so produced is separated from the reaction mixture by conventional methods, such as solvent extraction. Preferred solvents for use in this aspect of the invention include the lower chlorinated hydrocarbons, including mono and polychloro alkyl groups, having from one to three carbon atoms, with methylene chloride being a preferred solvent. The amidoamine is treated with a base o protic source to provide the corresponding diamine having the formula NH2 CH Ar CH2 NH CH2 2 OR2 VIII . The conditions used to produce the diamine and the preferred reactants are the same as stated for ring cleavage. Amidoamine VII has Ar, R1, and R2 in all embodiments the same as set forth above for imidazoline VI, and diamine VIII has Ar and R1 in its various embodiments the same as those taught for imidazoline VI. This novel diamine and the processes for producing it and its novel predecessor intermediates are the key to a regioselective synthesis of tetramisole. Various processes by which the diamine can be concerted to tetramisole will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the present teachings. A particularly preferred embodiment involves reacting the diamine with carbon disulfide to provide dithiocarbamate intermediate, represented by the tautomeric formula eSC S NH C Ar CH2 NH2 CH2 2 OR2 IX followed by cyclization with heat to produce l substituted 4 aryli midazolidin 2 thione having the formulaEMI7.1 The thione so produced is then treated with an acid having a pharmaceutically acceptable anion to provide imidazothiazole EMI8.1 It will be recognized that these are the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of d, l 6 aryl 2,3, 5,6 tetrahydroimidazo t2,1 b thiazole. When Ar is phenyl, the product is tetramisole. Such acid compounds can be neutralized with a base to provide the free thiazole XII , when this is desired. The dithiocarbamate is prepared by reacting diamine VIII with carbon disulfide at temperatures of from 10 to 400C. It is generally desirable to use from a 50 to 100 stoichiometric excess of carbon disulfide. This reaction step is desirably carried out in the presence of an inert vehicle such as one or more of the hydrocarbons or chlorinated hydrocarbons. Preferred hydrocarbons include lower alkyl, cycloalkyl, and aromatic materials such as benzene, toluene, xylenes, and the like, liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons having from five to 12 carbon atoms, such as hexane, isooctane, heptane, and the like, and liquid cycloaliphatic materials such as cyclohexane, cyclooctane, and the like and chlorinated hydrocarbons include the polyhalogenated lower aliphatic materials, a preferred vehicle being tetrachloroethane. The reaction time ranges from about 30 minutes to about four hours in certain desirable embodiments of the invention. The resulting dithio compound IX is cyclized by heating at 800 to 1500C. The ring closure to provide thione X is carried out for from about two to about 20 hours. Production of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the tetramisole is then effected on the recovered thione by acid treatment to close the thiaza ring. It will be understood from the present disclosure that the various intermediates can be recovered and purified as desired by conventional techniques such as extraction, solvent evaporation, water washing, and combinations of these conventional procedures. Further, the various steps can be carried out under subatmospheric or superatmospheric pressure. Unless superatmospheric pressure is desirable because of the volatility of a solvent or reactant, it is generally preferred to conduct all of the steps under atmospheric pressure. This provides further economy in not requiring special pressure vessels and handling techniques in commercial production. As taught herein, intermediates and imidazothiazoles can be prepared with a variety of aromatic substituents. In a particularly preferred embodiment for the preparation of tetramisole, the aryl group is phenyl. The following Examples are given to illustrate the invention. EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of i 2 Methoxyethyi 2 methyl 4 pghenyl 2 imidazoline A mixture of 41.6 g styrene and 131.2 g acetonitrile is cooled to OOC, and 28.4 g chlorine is bubbled through the mixture at a temperature of 0 to 50C during 75 minutes. The temperature is thereupon maintained at the same level, and 33 g 2 methoxyethylamine is added dropwise. The cooling bath used to maintain the low temperature is removed, and the temperature of the solution is allowed to rise gradually to 390C without any external heating.
