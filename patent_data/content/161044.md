# Dual frequency microwave antenna.

## Abstract
A microwave antenna comprising a dielectric substrate, carrying on one side thereof a microstrip antenna suitable for operation within a first frequency band and on the other side thereof a conductive ground plane, a first microwave feed coupled between the microstrip antenna and the ground plane for conducting microwave signals in the first band, at least one radiation aperture formed in the ground plane for operation within a second frequency band and arranged to communicate with a resonant microwave cavity defined between the ground plane and a conductive enclosure arranged to extend therefrom, and a second microwave signal feed coupled between the ground plane and the said enclosure for conducting microwave signals in the second band.
