# DEVICE FOR SUCTION STICKING DISPLAY LABELS

## Abstract
This device relates to a device for suction sticking display labels, in which display labels without being printed have been stuck contiguously in many number onto a long ground sheet which is wound on a feeding reel, the labels are peeled by a peeling metal fitting after they are printed, the ground sheet only is wound on a winding reel, the display labels are adsorbed by a suction bracket which is provided in front of the peeling metal fitting being drawn by the air intaken by the intake exhaust duct of the sticking device, and the display labels are stuck by the blow of air onto predetermined positions of package trays that come beneath the sticking device. In particular, this device relates to a device for suction sticking display labels, in which the label which is peeled off from the ground sheet being adsorbed by the intake exhaust bracket but which is still adhered at its rear end to the ground sheet, is forcibly peeled off by a proceed rectract device together with the intake exhaust bracket.
