# Welding torch position detection system and method.

## Abstract
A system and method for detecting the position of a welding torch means 20 with respect to a workpiece 14 by varying the electrical power to the arc, measuring the effect of such variation on the arc current and or arc voltage and processing the detected effect to produce welding torch means position related information. Also, a welding system and method which comprises utilizing this detection system and method along with means 30, 32, 34 to control the position of the welding torch means 20 with respect to the workpiece 14 .
