# Method of producing amorphous metallic material.

## Abstract
An amorphous metallic material such as metal having a desired irregularity is formed by irradiating a metal 1 with an electron beam 2 having an energy sufficient to damage the metal 1 to introduce a lattice defect into the metal and con trolling the concentration of the introduced lattice defect.
