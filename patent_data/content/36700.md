## Description
A COMPOSITION FOR THE COLD HARDENING O CONGLUTINATION OFMATERIALS, PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF AND USETHEREOF The present invention relates to a composition for the cold hardening or conglutination of materials, in particular those used in building, such as wood, expanded synthetic products, natural and synthetic fibres or minerals in powdered or fragmentary form, which composition has clear advantages over its known counterparts used in the above mentioned field. A process for the preparation of this composition is additionally included within the scope of the invention. In many industries, particularly in the building industry, it is frequently necessary for such materials to undergo hardening for the purpose of increasing their mechanical strength and also their resistance to the action of atmospheric agents, thus obtaining improved efficiency in their utilisation. Likewise, in many instances it is necessary to conglutinate various materials found in a powdered or fragmentary state, so as to obtain blocks or the like which can generally be used in the building industry, it being necessary for these artificially made blocks to have the characteristics of mechanical strength and resistance to atmospheric agents exhibited by blocks of natural origin. However, compositions which are used at present to obtain the aforementioned hardened or conglutinated materials suffer from both technical and economic disadvantages which affect their efficiency and applicability. In view of this situation, it has become necessary to provide a new composition which will satisfy in a particularly outstanding manner the technical requirements of these materials and which, at the same time, will be economically advantageous. Accordingly, the present invention provides a composition for the cold hardening or conglutination of materials, which comprises a liquid component formed by a neutral aqueous solution of a chloride of magnesium or calcium, stabilised with an aqueous solution of a sulphate of the same metal and a solid component formed by an oxide of the metal corresponding to the chloride and sulphate. The chloride used in this composition is preferably analytically pure and the water used to obtain the corresponding solutions is preferably chemically pure and free of salts. The above mentioned constituents of the composition of this invention are preferably present in the composition within the following proportions magnesium or calcium chloride 600 800 parts by weight water 900 1100 parts by weight aqueous solution of magnesium or calcium sulphate 5 15 parts by weight magnesium or calcium oxide 900 1100 parts by weight The product of the present invention may be prepared using a process which comprises the following stages A dissolving analytically pure magnesium or calcium chloride in chemically pure water B leaving the resultant solution to stand for at least 24 hours C adding to this solution a solution of analytically pure magensium sulphate in chemically pure water D stirring the resultant solution and leaving it to stand for a period of not less than 4 hours and at the end of this period, filtering and incorporating powdered magnesium or calcium oxide into the filtrate. To enable the present invention to be readily understood, one example of the preparation of a composition in accordance with the present invention is given below, solely by way of illustration.EXAMPLE 700 g of analytically pure crystallised magnesium chloride were poured slowly into and dissolved in 1000 cc of chemically pure water. Once the chloride was completely dissolved the resultant solution was left to stand for a period of not less than 24 hours, after which 10 cc of a solution of 5 g of analytically pure magnesium sulphate in 10 cc of chemically pure water were added thereto. The resultant solution was stirred and was left to stand for a period of not less than 4 hours, at the end of which it was then filtered and 1000 g of analytically pure calcined magnesium oxide were added to the filtrate thus providing a composition ready for use in the hardening and or conglutination of materials. The same results were obtained using analytically pure calcium chloride instead of magensium chloride, the magnesium sulphate and magnesium oxide also being replaced by calcium sulphate and calcium oxide, respectively, which were used in the same amounts as specified above. The composition of the present invention may be used to cause the hardening andyor conglutination of various materials among which may be mentioned volcanic lava, chalk, quartz, talc, carborundum, aluminium oxide, zinc oxide, sawdust and vegetable fibres in general, cork sawdust, pulverised or fragmentary charcoal or coal, paper in general, powdered or fragmentary hide, peat, calcium carbonate, vermiculite, expanded clay, expanded polystyrene, sands, pulverised glass, brick dust, powdered crude or fired kaolins, pure iron slags, cotton waste, textile waste in general, cereal husks in general, glass fleece and glass fibres, powdered or fraylnentary iron oxide, powdered or fragmentary lead oxide, ferrites, pulverised or fragmentary granites and any type of calcic, granitic or calcerous stones, powdered micas and clays in general. The foregoing list of materials, to which the composition of the present invention may be applied, is merely given by way of example, since the field of application of this composition is extremely broad. It is thus possible to apply the composition to all those materials to which it is desired to impart the properties of hardness and or conglutination which enables them to be used in those industries in which an increased mechanical strength and resistance to atmopsheric agents are required. By way of illustration, the following may be mentioned as materials treated with the composition of the present invention covering and linings in general, panels for partitions in houses rooms, floors, roofing tiles, slates, piles, posts, board poles, tables, frames for doors and windows, special rods, substitutes of all types where wood is used, sanitary fittings in general, panels for Australian tanks, sheets and plates for roofing or for the construction of silos, bridge structures, hulls for boats, pipes for chimneys, refractory bricks, bricks of ceramic and non ceramic type, roofing slabs, flat and corrugated sheets in general, handles for domestic utensils in general, imitation marble, etc. It should be pointed out that the composition of the present invention makes possible the cold hardening of the material to which it is applied, the material being ready for use as from the fourth day of its production. The material treated with the compositon of the present invention requires only 3 days of drying at ambient temperature, there being no necessity for any type of drying by the application of heat. It is worth noting that the material thus obtained does not undergo any type of alteration, cracking or modification to its original form when subjected to temperatures of from 25 C below zero to 300 C above zero.Neither do alterations of any sort occur when the material treated with the composition of the present invention is exposed to temperatures of 3000C and them immediately to temperatures as low as 25 C below zero. The material can be produced with or without its own lustre, this property depending on the method of manufacture employed. Neither do modifications occur in the colour imparted to the material within the heat range indicated above, the pigment used being incorporated into the mass of the material, for which reason discoloration due to wear or weathering is not observed. The material treated with the composition of the invention does not exude or absorb moisture it is totally non inflammable. Furthermore, because no heat is required for its drying, the production of pieces of various sizes shapes or reliefs is possible, without any limitation. The materials to which the industrial product of the present invention is applied may be produced by extrusion, casting with or without pressure, rolling, moulding, injection, vacuum or blowtorch injection, it being possible for the product of the invention to be incorporated in liquid, solid or semi solid form, the physical state of the product depending on or being adapted to the type of mechanical process chosen for the manufacture of said material.
