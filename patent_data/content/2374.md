# Radiation collector.

## Abstract
A radiation collector 10 comprises a plurality of conduit sections 17 which are connected or connectible to form at least part of a continuous conduit for the passage therethrough of a heat collecting fluid, a plurality of substantially parallel cylindrical form lenses 15 which may be Fresnel lenses disposed on one side of the conduit sections 17 and substantially parallel thereto, and a plurality of substantially parallel concave reflectors 16 disposed on the other side of the conduit sections 17 and substantially parallel thereto, the concave reflectors 16 facing towards the conduit sections 17 and lenses 15 and the arrangement of the lenses, conduit sections and reflectors being such that for at least some angles of incidence of radiation on the lenses, the incident radiation is concentrated on the exterior surface of the conduit sections 17 directly from the lenses 15 and or indirectly after reflection from the reflectors 16 . In some embodiments, all the conduit sections 17 have their axes in a common plane and all the reflectors 16 have equal concavity. These embodiments may be disposed with the conduit sections 17 in an East West direction for receiving solar energy over a relatively long period of daylight. In other embodiments best suited to be mounted with their conduit sections in a North South direction, alternate conduit sections 17a, 17b have their axes in different respective planes and corresponding reflectors 16a, 16b have appropriate curvatures. These other embodiments can receive radiation over longer daylight periods, but not all conduits will receive concentrated radiation at all times. The principal advantage of the radiation collector is that it will collect radiation efficiently over a relatively wide range of incident angles without the need for mechanical apparatus to vary the attitude of the collector or to vary the relative positions of the lenses, conduit sections and reflectors.

## Description
Radiation Collector The present invention relates to a radiation collector, and more particularly, but by no means exclusively, to a radiation collector of tie type used for collecting or recovering solar radiation. The latter type of radiation collector is usually termed a solar panel or solar heat collector. Radiation coiJectors which are known and used generally comprise a body on which the radiation is received and a fluid usually a liquid which is passed in heat exchange relationship with the body. In some ances, radiation focussing or concentrating devices such as lenses or mirrors are employed to increase the amount of radiation received by the body and recovered by the fluid. A problem with present radiation collectors of the solar panel type, particularly in high latitudes, is that the temper ature rise in the heat receiving body and the heat collecting fluid passing in heat exchange relationship therewith tends to be insufficient during the winter months for such purposes as space heating, and water heating, and too low during the summer months for air conditionino uses.Focussing devices cnablc higher temperatures to be attained, but such devices must track the sun s path in order to be effective. Such tracking involves the provision of suitable mechani al dexiccs, and the latter make tracking radiation collector, equipne lt expensive to instal and, as with any mechanical device, necessitafe regular maintenance. The present invention provides a radiation collector comprising a plurality of substantially parallel conduit sections of which at least some are connectible or connected to each other in series and or in parallel to form at least part of a continuous conduit for the. passage therethrough of a heat collecting fluid a plurality of substantially parallel cylindrical form lenses disposed to one side of the said conduit sections a ffl substantially parallel thereto and a plurality of substantially parallel concave reflectors disposed on the other side of said conduit sections and substantially parallel thereto the concave reflectors facing in a direction towards the said conduit sections and lenses, the arrangement and construction being such that radiation falling on the lenses of the collector is concentrated on the exterior surface of the conduit sections by the lenses directly and or indirectly after reflection from the reflectors. By cylindrical form lens is meant any type of lens capable of forming a linear image and or of concentrating radiation e.g.visible light along traight line or band. The lenses employed in the radiation collector of the invention may be conventional cylindrical lenses, or they may each be of the multi prism type e.g., Fresnel lenses. The lenses are preferably flat on the side facing away from the conduit sections thereby facilitating their cleaning. The a , such gl latter par ly . ively eratur int radi tiv low . respecti per the p ining oslie boundar the ve long bs ti inte the centrel of a condait ion, and pre bly. the siad plane at th said of the respectin lens sub tantially intersects the line of a reflectat.

For ex mple, a plurali y of leusos may be cast as a unit rom a suitable plasties materiol or silicope rubber.Such a unit may be attached t a r nt sh et of arent material such as glase if the unit lacks a equste rigidity. pl ne at th atre line of a rrsp etive lens, perpendiculer to the pl joining opposite boundary cd s of the respective lens, erably substantialiy in recets the c ntre line of a reflcetor. ather badiment, the ref ecters whose centre lines are subst nt ly inter et the said planes at the centre lines ef the lenses altern te with the reflectors whose centre liues are bstantial intersected the said planes at the boundary edge of respective lenses, the boundary e ges of alternate roflesters being utually adj ining. Preferably, co dnit svetiens whose axes or centre lines are substantially intersected the said planes through the centrelines respective lenses have their ares substantially in a first pl or laver, and conduit sectiens whose axes are substantially int rsected by the said planes at the boundary edges of respective lenses have their axes substantially in a second plane or layer. Pref rahly, the canduit sections having their axes or centre lines substantially in the first plane or layer and the conduit svetions l viag their axes or centre lines substantially in the seccnd plane or layer are separately connected or connectible for the passage of heat cellecting fluid through respective fluid eirculation circuits. With some arrangements of the lenses, conduit sections and coneave reflectors, it is possible that at some angles of receipt of radiation in the c e reflectors the so called acceptance angle cf the reflector , at least some radiation in each reflector may be reflected from region to region and then reflected out of the collecter without being reflected onto the surface of a cerresponding conduit section. This is particularly most likely to occur by reflection of radiation through a space between the corraspo ing conduit section and the part of the reflector which is most distant from the layer of lenses i.e., by reflection through the space beneath the conduit section across the bottch region of the reflector when the colloctor is mounted for use with the len es sppermost and the reflectors beneath and facing the lenses. In order to avoid radiation losses from this cause, the reflecters may have a radiatico eflective riage which extends towards, and which may if pecessary touch, the region of the surface of the conduit section which is most distant from the layer of lenses.Such a ridge prevents the reflection of radiation between the said most distant parts from th lens layer of the relevant conduit section and reflecter and causes substantially all the radiation rearived by the relevant refle eto to be reflected oto the surface of the correspending conduit section without being reflected out of the collector.Concave reflectors having confignrations suitable for trapping radiation are known in the art, and are often referred to in the art as compound reflectors . An example of a compound re lector is given in figure 1 of an article by R. Winston in AppliedOptics , Volume 17, page 1668 1st June 1978 where it is referred to as a trough like concentrator . In radiation collectors accerding to the invention comprising conduit sections in two or more planes or layers, means may be provided for connection, in series and or in parallel, whichever layer of conduit sections attains a temperature e.g.as determined from the temperature of fluid therein which is either the highest temperature er which exceeds a selected temperature for circulation the fluid e.g. liquid to a suitable heat storage facility an or lot fluid usage means. The radiation collector of the invention may be fixedly mounted in any suitable attitiude rclative to the scurce of radiation. For solar panels wherein all the conduit sections have their centre lines or axes substantially in one plane or layer, it is preferred to meunt tile collector with the fixes oi centre lines of the conduit sections in an East West direction.when thus mounted, all of the conduit sections receive solar adiation during all daylight hours, subject solely to the iptical limitations of tilit solar palici.. These optical limita ions are mainly due to the well konwn fact that cylindrical lenses, p rtieularly those of the Presnel type, have a focal length which varies w the angle of ineidence of radiation, the foeal Peng being reduced at large angles of incidence e.g. at dawn and dus and inereased at small angles of incidence e.g.at midday . Those skilled in the art will be able to provide the best relative locations of partieular lenses, conduit sections and reflecters by the exercise their ordinary knowledge of the cptical eteristies of cylindrical lenses. For selar panels wherein the conduit sections have their exes or centre lines in two or ove planes or layers, it is preforred mount the collector with the axes or centre lines of the conduit sections in a North South direction. when thus ounted. a first layer of conduit sections receives concentrated radiation while a second layer may receive little or mo radiation at one time of day. At another time of day, the first layer may receive little or no radiation while the second layer of conduit sections receives concentrated radiation.Of course, there may be times of day when both the first and second layers of conduit svetions receive relatively concentrated radiation, depending, inter alia, upon the geometrical and optical characteristics of the reflecters. It is preferred to mount the solar panel to receive as much radiation as possible at the highest concentrations subject to thermodynamic considerations when the energy requirement from the panel is greatest. To this end, the panel should be mounted with an angle of tilt which depends, inter alia, on the latitude of q the location of tile panel and the season s in which the radiation collecting properties are to be most exploited. Tile solar panel may he fixedly mounted or it may be mounted so that its angle of tilt can be varied according to tie time of year and the nergy reqIlirements at tllat time of year. A plucality of adi iring refl ters may be ade from a single piece of mrterial which is lective or treated to be refle ted. Al ruatively, cach reflector may be separately formed from the adjoining r lectors either wholly er in part. The surface of each cenduit section is prafterably ad and or coated with a subst uce having good radia ion absorpaion properties and low emissivity. Substances having these desitable properties are well kno n and inelude, inter lia, finely eivided materials e.g., chrome black wherein the distance letween a raised part el one partiele and an adjarent raised part of the same or another partiele is less then the wavelength of the radiation to be collected,and layers or material which use incident radietion to be partly re lected within the layers in such a vay that interference occurs within the layers thereby trapping radiation. It is preferred that the radiation is not concentrated as a line focus on the surfaces of the conduit sections since the resultingly high temperatures could have an adverse effect on the surfaces. Instead, it is preferred that the radiation is concentrated as a band on the surfaces of the conduit sections. Preferably, the conduit sections and the corresponding lenses and reflector are as long as possible within the constraints imposed by the location of the radiation collector since this will reduce the numbers of conduit sections required for a given energy requirement. The advantage of having a relatively small number of conduit sections arises from the fact that straight conduit sections are relatively cheap, and that the greater the number of conduit sections, the greater will e the numbers of conncetions at the ends of pairs of conduit seetion for the flow of heat collecting fluid. The end connections play no part in collecting radiation irdecd, they are preferably shaded from radiation , and the more end connections there are, the greater will be the cost of the radiation collector a given energy output. The radiation collector of the invention enables radiation t be collceded over a relatively wide ranger Or incident angles with a relatively high efficiency and without the necessity of previding s enabling the collector to tolow or track the source of radiation, although the collector may be provided with means for making adjustments to it s attitude so that, for example.it provides energy for air conditioning in summer and for space heating in winter. The invention is now further described with reference to the accompanying drwings which show diagrammatically the principal features of solar radiation collectors, hervinafter referred to as solar panels , and in which Figure 1 is a simplified isometric view of a first type of embodiment of a solar panel according to the invention, with parts broken away to show tie principal internal components thereof and the general mode of construction and arrangement Figure 2 is a schematic and diagrammatic cross sectional view of the panel of figure l as seen when looking in the direction of arrow A of figure 1 Figure 3 is a simplified isometric view of a second type of embodiment of a solar panel according to the invention with parts broken away to show the principal internal components thereof and general mode of constf tion and arrangements Figure 4 is a schematic diagrammatic cross sectional view of the panel of figure 3 as seen when looking in the direction of arrow B oL figure 3 Figure 5 is a schematic diagram illustrating the general arrangement of a solar panel of the invention with associated equipment and Figure 6 is a schematic diagram similar to that of figure 5 but for a different general arrangement. Referrin first figure die panel 10 har the e form of a parallelopiped, one b and p being of coasiderably go eater size t the side walls 13 and 14.The bottom and side wille 11 13 and 14 are made of opa e materials which are preterably of low thermal condtotivity, and they may be lagged to raduce hast losses thare hroug . The top wall 12 is transparent to the radiation which is to be collected e.g. solar radiation and may be e more radiation transparent layers to reduce he lasses the interior of the panel. As depiered for simplicity il re tion, however, and in preferred b i ents the to wall shown as being formed from a single layer which may be mp site layer which is substantially flat on the de of e panel and comprised of a succession of substantlally cylindrical lenses 15 on the inside of the panel. Between the top wall 12 and the bottom wall are a successi of substantially parallel concave reilecting elements refiectors 16 which are concave on heir reilecting surfaces which face the top wall 12, the reflectors 16 being substantially parallel to the cylindrical lenses 15. Between the cylindrical lenses 15 and tile reflectors 16 are z plurality of conduit or pipe sections 17 which substantially paraliel to the lenses 15 and reflectors 16, and connected or connectible in one or more circuits in parallel or series or series parallel for the passage therethrough of a suitable heat collecting liquid. In the embodiment depicted in figure 1, the width of each reflector 16 is substantially equal to the wi th of e ch ens . and the reflectors 16 and lenses 15 are laterally o f et to each other so that a plane parpendieular to the plane ing the opposite boundary edges 15a, 15b of a lens 15 ,e. pl e parallel to the normal of a lens 15 substantially intersects the centre line of a reflector 16 where the re lector 16 is ri cal about its centre line. the aid plane pa lle to the mal ef each lens 15 also inteisects th ntre line ur axie of a pipe scction 17.

The nn in which the panel 10 of figure l work is now seribed with reforene to figure 2, wherein P designates one of the rmal pl s, which is parpendieular to the plane e.g. the pl of side 12 joinin the apposite boundary cdges 15a, 15b of a lespcetive lens 15. light rays c, e from a distant source i.e. paraliel light revs impinging normally on the surface 12, i.e., parallel to plane P, are refracted as they pass through the lenets 15 s as to be convergent.The refracted rays c, c are reflected b the reflectors 16 and are concentrated on the urf ce of ach of the pipe sections 17 over a narrow band C1. lt will be appreciated that if the positions of the pipe soctions 17 were swch that the surfaces thereof were in the focal planes of the redinti eon ntrating system comprising the lenses 15, the rays would be concentrated on the surface of the pipe sectjans 17 in a line focus. However, although the latter arrangement is within the ambitof the present invention, it is less preferred becanse many efficient radiation absorbing surface atings are damaged by exposure to excessively high local te peratures and therefore, in most instances, it is more preierred to consentrate the light in a band as indicated by C1 of figure 2.

The polyuratl or other pl material preferably fills the spa between the refiectis, surfaces and the bottom wall 11. Al the for in structions are not illustrated, those stilled in the know how to make such co rr tions. For co enionce, the space the len flectors 1 may be occupied by ir and a ent 1 vided to accommodare chanpes in of the changes in temperature. The vent preferably is provided with a suitable filter not shown to prevent the entrance of dust into the sola panel. The mode of construetion of a suitable vent hole and ilter will be known to those skilled in the art. In some arrangements of lenses 15, reflectors 16 and pipe sections 17, it is possible that light c ncentrated on the reflectors 16 by the lenses is reflected out of the panel without falling i the pipe sections. This is I. 1 ilcely to occur by reflection of concentrated light from one part of a reflector 16 along a path between the bottom of the pipe seetion 17 and tile bottom of the rellector to another part of the reflector, from where the light is reflected out of the panel.This could occur, for example, at a time when the incident angle of light is between the ineident angles of rays d and rays c. If routine optical and geometrie considerations indicate that such reradiation could occur, tile reflectors 16 might have the form of a compound reflector referred to above provided with a reflective ridge extending towards, and possibly touching, the bottom of the pipe section. Such a compound reflector is shown by way of example in dotted lies for one reflector 16c of figure 2 to form a ridge indicated by 16r.Other types of compound reflector known in the art may be employed to suit the operating conditions and geometric and ap al forms of, and constraints on, the panel. Reference is now made to figure 5 wliicli shows the general arrang ments of the panel 10 with part of an energy storage utilization systel The pipe sections 17 are joined at their adjacent ends by bends to for a single serpentine fluid flow path through the panel 10. The bends are shaded and preferably insulated to prevent energy losses from the fluid therein. The fluid employed is preferably a liquid and for relatively low temperature uses and at more elevated temperatures when the fluid, circulation conduits are capable of withstanding relatively elevated pressures, the liquid may be water with suitable additives if necessary to reduce and or inhibi t corrosion and to reduce the freezing temperature.For higher temperature uses, an organic liquid composition may be employed. Such a composition, may be a single organic compound or a mixture of organic compounds, including if necessary suitable additives to reduce and or inhibit degradation of the compound s and deposition in the liquid flow circuit. The liquid is circulated through the pipe sections 17 by a pump 20, and heated liquid passes via a valve 21 to a suitable storage tank 22, cool liquid being withdrawn from the tank 22 and circulated to the pump 22. A liquid is passed into and out of the tank 22 via conduits 26, 27 t6 recover heat andYor to supply make up for liquid circulated in the panel 10. The temperature of liquid circulating in the pipe sections 17 of the panel 10 is determined by a probe 23 and the temperature of liquid in the tank 22 is determined by a probe 24.The rate of liquid circulation may be controlled, e.g. according to the energy demand, by varying the setting of valve 21, and if the temperature as detected by probe 24 eeds that as detected by probe 23, the pump may be stopped. control systems for effec ting the foregoing examplary modes of operation are known to those skilled in the art. Reference is now made to the embodiment of figures 3 and 4, which may be regarded as a variant of the embodiment of figures 1 and 2, and in which each of the concave reflectors 16 has a width measured across the widest part of half the width of each lens 15. Each reflector 16a whose centre line is intersected by a plane passing through the boundary edge of a lens 15 and parallel to the normal to the lens 15 alternates with a reflector 16b whese centre line is intersected by a plany passing through the entre line of a lens 15 end parallel to the normal to the lens 15. The reflecters 16a are not as decply recessed as the refle etors 16b.A ipe section 17a is disposed relative to each reflector 16a for receiving concentrated radiation either dir etly from a lens 15 or indirectly after reflection from the reflector 16a in the manner described with reference to figures 1 and 2. A pipe section 17b is disposed relative to each reflector 16b for receiving concentrated radiation either directly from a lens 15 or indireatly after reflection from the corresponding reflector 16b. Tn practice, the pipe sections 16a are disposed with their axes in one plane or layer parallel to the top plane of the leilsIS 15, and tile pipe sections 17b are disposed with their axes in a second plane or layer parallel to tlle top plane of the lenses 15, but more distant therefrom than the plane of the axes of the pipe sections 17a. The plane of tic axes of the pipe sections 17a is nearer to the lenses 15 than their focal plane, and the plane of the axes of the pipe sections 17b is further fran the lenses than their focal pifine. The advantage of this embodiment is that the panel 10 can receive radiation over a largcr range of incident angles than can the embodiment of figures 1 and 2, and to make the best use of this advantage, it is preferred to moun the panel 10 with the pipe sections in aNorth South direction. The panel 10 is tilted as appropriate to collect radiation at the greatest efficiency during the period when the panel 10 is intended to provide energy. Figure 4 shows more particularly the mode of operation of the panel 10 of figure 3 when mounted North South . It is seen that as the angle of incidence of radiation e.g. sunlight changes from angle 1 to angle 7, the radiation is concentrated by the lenses on the pipe sections 17a at angles 1, 2, 4 and 5, and on the pipe sections 17b at angles 3, 6 and 7.Concentrated radiation is directed onto the pipe sections 17a, 17b either onto the upper surfaces thereof directly from the lenses or onto the lower surface thereof aiter reflection from a respective reflector lGa or 16b as wii bc apparent from the radiation paths indicated in the portion above the line C C of figure 4.Accor diltg to the desi , n of the panel 10 of figure 3, it will be appreciated that radiation may be received by one set of pipe sections 17a, 17b at a time or there may be a relatively short overlap period during which radiation is received by both sets of pipe sections 17a, 17b. When only one set of pipe sections receives radiation, the other set may be inactivated by interrupting fluid flow therethrough as described below with reference to figure 6, or alternatively, the other set may continue to receive at least some fluid flow in order to regulate the temp erature of the fluid by re radiating energy out of the panel 10. One or both sets of reflectors 16a, 16b may be formed from compound reflectors as described above , and may be of the type described in relation to figure 2. The trackiiig of the radiation is symmetrical and a wide tracking angle alpha is achieved without the necessity of altering the disposition of the panel as a whole or of parts thereof.Moreover, the amount of metal required for the panel 10 of figure 3 is considerably y le less t on for previously known types of panel adapted for North South mounting, and if the pipe sections are of ordinary piping, the overall cost of the panel is relatively low. however, the amount of metal, and the cost of the panel, exceeds that of the figure 1 embodiment. Figure 6 shows the general arrangeme.nt of the liquid flow circuits for the panel of figure 3. The upper pipe sections 17a i.e., the conduit sections nearest to the lenses 15 are eted to each other in serics by suitable bends to forii one serpentine low path. the lower pipe sections 17b are cennected in series suitable bends te form another serpentine path. The p nel as a whole is indieated by the broken line onfline 19, and it will be appreciated that each bend connecting each pipe section 17a or 17b in series to the next pipe is shaded trom the ineident radiation and insulated so as to prevent heat lesses by, e.g., radiation from the bends.Each series ot pipe sections 17a, 7h forms part of one of two alternative flow circuits comprising a common pump 20, respcctive solenoid valves 21a and 21b, a common storage tank 22 and suitable interconnecting piping. The alternative flow circuits are activated by either temperature or radiation detectors, e.g. by thermocouples 23n or 23b so connected, by any means which will be known to those skilled in the art, that the solenoid valve 21a is arranged to be operate to circulate heat collecting liquid wheri a solenoid valve 21a or 21b is opened, but preferably an over ride control not shown , of any t ype known to those skilled in the art, is provided to interrupt operation of the pump when the temperature in the storage tank 22 is higher than the temperature of the hottest pipes of the collector. The over ride may be responsive to a thermocouple ,2A associated with the storage tank 22. One of the problems encountered with some previously known solar panels is that the heat collecting fluid may become excessivaly hot under some operating conditions. The panel of figures 3 and 4 may be adapted to avoid such overiteating by providing that some heat collecting liquid flows through the set of pipe sections 17a or 17b which is not receiving concentrated radiation from the lenses 15 and reflectors 16. The non irradiated redundant pip sections re radiate energy out of the panel and l ay there y be employed to cool any liquid passed therethrougll. Preferably, the diversion of some liquid to flow through the redundant pipe sections is effected automatically in response to an excessively high temperature signal from any of the thermocomples e.g. 23a, 23b , which signal causes a regulated amount of openinp of the solenoid valve 21a, 20b ontrolling tile flow of liquid to that redundant pipe sections 1.7a, 17b. The manner in which the opening and closing of tii solenoid valves 21a, 21b in response to a signal indicative of an excessively high temp crature will be apparent to those skilled in the relevant art. Although the foregoing two embodiments show panels having respectively one layer of pipe sections and reflectors figures 1 and 2 and two such layers figures 3 and 4 , it is within the scope of the invention to provide three or more such layers it more layers, the panel and its associated equipment will be more costly, but its tracking angle will be increased. Features which are described in relation to one embodiment may be employed in other embodiments within departing from the invention.
