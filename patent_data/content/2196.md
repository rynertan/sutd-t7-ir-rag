## Description
AMINE TERMINATED POLYMERS AND THE FORMATION OF BISCK COPOLYMERS ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE Polymers of anionically polymerized monomers s .t.h as mono olefins, onugated dienes, vinyl substituted aromatics, vinyl substituted pyridine, vinyl substituted quinolines, various aldehydes, various epoxides, various oxetanes, various oxygen containing compounds, and the like are produced and end capped with a polyisocyanate or polyisothiocyanate having the formula R4N C X wherein R is a hydrocarbon, n is 2 or 3, and Y is oxygen or sulfur.Such end capped polymers of course, contain one reacted or connected isocynate or isothiocyanate group and the least one free isocanate or isothiocanate end group, which free end group reacts with an amide to give an imide end group. The imide termin ated polymer is then hydrolyzed to form a stable amine terminated polymer. The reaction of the amide compound with the isocyanate s or isothiocyanate s , followed by hydrolysis, results in the replacement of the free isocyanate or isothiocyanate end group s with an amine group s . Thus, the amine terminated polymer contains the polymer connected to an is yanate or isothiocyanate group now an amide group or a thioamide group , which in turn is the polyisocyanate, which in turn is connected to the formed amine group.The amine terminated polymers may be stored extended periods of time and then reacted with various polymers, prepoly mers, monomers, or various combinations thereof to form various ii block or graft copolymers. That is, the amine terminated polymer may be subsequently reacted with any amine reactive compound such as epoxy monomers or an epoxy prepolymer in the presence of known epoxy catalysts to give a blocked epoxy copolymer. Similarli the amine terminated polymer may be reacted with urea prepolymers or ur ea for.ming monomers to yield. a block urea copolymer. Reactio of the amine terminated polymer with urethane polymers, urethane prepolymers, or urethane forming monomers will yield a urethane block copolymer.Reaction of the amine terminated polymer with aretnane urea prepolymers or urethane urea forming monomers will yell a urethane urea block copolymer. Similarly, various dian hycride and diamine monomers may be utilized to fonn an imide block copolymer. CROSS REFERENCE This application is a continuation in part of our copending United States Application bearing Serial No. 574,676, filed May 5, 1975 for AMINE TERMINATED POLYMERS AND THE FORMA TION OF BLOCK COPOLYMERS . BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the anionic polymeriz ticn of generally. olefinic type polymers and the termination thereof with an amine end group. More specifically, the present i inventnon relates to the formation of amine terminated, anionica polymerizable polymers which are stable and yet can be reacted with amine reactive compounds such as monomers or polymers to form block copolymers. Such block copolymers are generally easily processed in a manner typical of the anionically produced polymers such as elastomers but yet, upon cure, generally exhibit properties typical of the other constituent. A specific aspect of the present invention therefore relates to the formation of an epoxy block copolymer. In another specific aspect, the present invention relates to the formation of a urea formaldehyde graft copolymer.In yet another specific aspect, the present invention relates to the formation of an acetalized polyvinyl alcohol graft copolymer. In yet another specific aspect, the present invention relates to the formation of a phenol formaldehyde graft copolymer.In yet another specific aspect, the present invention relates to the formation of a nylon block copolymer. In yet another specific aspect, the present invention relates to the formation of a urea block copolymer. In yet another specific aspect, the present invention relates to the formation of a urethane urea block copolymer. In yet another specific aspect, the present invention relates to the formation of Åa urethane block copolymer. In yet another specific aspect, the present invention relates to the formation of an imide block copolymer. The polymerization of conjugated dienes and or vinyl substituted aromatic compounds with organo alkali metal initiators is well known in the art. The resulting alkali metal terminated polymers are often reacted with polyfunctional compounds to couple the polymers, for example, U. S. Patent Nos. 3,135,716 3,468,972 3,225,119 and 3,281,383. However, none of these patents disclose the preparation of anionically polymerized poly mers which contain a terminal amine. Moreover, anionic polymers used in the preparation of block copolymers having a constituent other than the initial constituent is not disclosed. Various inventions exist which utilize amines for various purposes. For example, U. S. Patent No. 3,017,392 relates to the Formation of linear polyamides by the polymerization of lactsms. The polymerization is carried out in the presence of A tertiary nitrogen atom contain ing compound and a molecular weight regulating concentration of a primary or secondary amine. In U. S. Patent No. 3,028,369, a polymerization of lactams is en har.c d by the addition of an organic isocyanate used as an initia tor or promoter. In an article by Mottus, Hendrick and Butler, Polymer Preprints, 9 1 , 390 1968 , it is stated that the initial polymerization of caprolactam can be controlled with use of jj anL,ne mcdifiers to give products over a wide range of molecular we ghts. Primary amines are effective as modifiers with secondary amines showing less modifying action and tertiary amines being inactive. The control is hypothesized to involve chain termina tire ancl acyl transfer. However, none of these patents suggests the amine termination of an anionically polymerized polymer which may be utilized in the formation of block copolymers.In it U. S. Serial No. 219,161, now U. S. Patent No. 3,838 108. theme is disclosed the formation of various block copolymers. However, the block copolymers disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 3,838,108, generally had to be made in one continuous process since the anionically polymerized polymer with isocyanate or polyisocyanate end caps tended to be unstahle and could not be si crnd for any appreciable period of time. That is, moisture or active hydrogen containing impurities would react with the highly reactive isocyanate and prevent the formation of the desired block copolymer. Moreover, in the absence of active hydrogen compounds, trimerization or dimerization of the isocyanate or isothiocyanate may occur. The requirement of a continuous polymerization is at times uneconomical and impractical, especially when tailor made products are desired.Moreover, another disadvantage of the continous formation of the block copolymer is that due to various parameters involved, the precise percentage of a polyolefin type polymer end capped by an isothiocyanate or isocyanate would vary from time to time and generally was very difficult to control or te determine immediately. Such variation tended to produce block copolymers of less than optimum and sometimes undesirable properties in situations wherein a precise stoichiometric amount of monomer or polymer was required as in the formation of a polyimide block copolymer. Moreover, many patents have disclosed the combination of phenolic resins with rubber stocks for use as tire cord dips and or adhesives. These patents generally depend upon the reactio of the phenolic hydroxyl for joining the two materials, for example, British Patent Nos. 1,137,046 and 1,131,549, or use phenolic compounds which contain polymeric or oligomeric substituents, for example, Netherlands Patent No. 6,612,301. Moreover, unusual or exotic type catalysts are required such as a metallic cocatalyst as in British Patent No. 1,137,046 or BF3 as inNetherlands Patent No. 6,612,301.. The present invention does not require any catalyst or precautions beyond that known to the preparation of phenolic resins.Rather, the present invention generally relates to the preparation of block copolymers which are capable of being cured to give thermosetting resins which can be used as adhesives and, when mineral filled and coumpounded, show good flexural strenght greater than 11,000 psi and good flexural modulus greater than 990,000 psi , coupled with high heat distortion 2300C at 264 psi . The graft copolymers are prepared by reacting phenol aldehyde materials with amine terminated polymers to form the graft copolymer. U. S. Patent No. 3,331,730 relates to the preparation of phenolic resins esterfied with unsaturated monocarboxylic acids and laminates therefrom. Once again, a polymer is prepared through reaction of the phenolic hydroxyl groups and results in a completely different polymer. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to produce anionically prepared polymers which are amine terminated. It is also an object of the present invention to produce anionically prepared polymers which are reacted with either polyisocyanates or polyisothiocyanates, further reacted with an amide compound, and then hydrolyzed to form an amine terminated polymer.

Suitable monomers represented by Formula No. 8 do not include large R groups such as two phenyl groups since such monomers are difficult to polymerize de to steric hindrance. Other preferred monomers which may generally be used to prepare the isocyanate terminated polymers of this invention are the conjugated dienes and the vinyl substituted aromatic compounds. The conjugated dienes ordinarily contain from 4 to 12 carbon atoms and preferably from 4 to 8 carbon atoms. Examples of such dienes include 1,3 butadiene, isoprene, 2,3 dimethyl 1,3butadiene, 2 methyl 1,3 pentadiene, 3, 4 dimethyl l, 3 hexadiene, 4,5 diethyl 1,2 octadiene, 3 butyl 1,3 octadiene, phenyl 1,3butadiene, and the like. The vinyl substituted aromatic compounds include styrene, l vinylnaphthalene, 2 vinylnaphthalene, and the alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkaryl and aralkyl derivatives thereof in which the total number of carbon atoms in the compound is generally at least 8 but not greater than 20.Examples of such compounds include the various vinyltoluenes such as 2 ,, 3 , or 4 methylstyrene, alpha methylstyrene, 4 n propylstyrene, 4 tbutylstyrene, 4 dodecylstyrene, 4 cyclohexylstyrene, 2 ethyl 4benzylstyrene, 4 methoxystyrene, 4 dimethylaminostyrene, 3,5diphenoxystyrene, 4 p tolylstyrene, 4 phenylstyrene, 4,5 dimethyll vinylnaphthalene, 3 n propyl 2 vinylnaphthalene, and the like. The conjugated dienes and the vinyl substituted aromatic compounds, as well as many of the other monomers noted herein, generally can be polymerized a1 one or in a mixture to form homopolymers, copolymers or block copolymers which serve as the base polymer. The dienes which are preferred are 1,3 butadiene and isoprene, and preferred vinyl substituted aromatic monomers are styrene, vinyltoluene, alpha methylstyrene and 4 t butylstyrene. A preferred copolymer is styrene butddiene. Yet another group of monomers which can be employed are the heterocyclic nitrogen containing monomers such as pyridine and quinoline derivatives containing at least a vinyl or an alphamethylvinyl group such as 2 vinylpyridine, 3 vinylpyridine, 4 vinylpyri dine, 3 ethyl 5 vinylpyridine, 3 methyl 5 vi nylpyridine 3, 5 diethyl 4 vinylpyridine and similar mono and disubstituted alkaryl pyridines, and the like quinolines such as 2 vinylquinoline, 3 vinylquinoline, 4 vinylquinoline,. and so forth. In general, the various vinyl substituted pyridines and vinyl substituted quinolines are also preferred monomers. Monomers which are highly preferred are the rubberforming monomers such as the conjugated dienes and mixtures of dienes and vinyl substituted aromatics such as butadiene styrene. The polymers are prepared by anionically polymerizing the monomers with conventional anionic initiators such as organo alkali metal initiators in a manner which is well known to those skilled in the art. Although these initiators can be either monoor polyfunctional, the monofunctional initiators are preferred for the present invention. The preferred metal is lithium although sodium, potassiur rubidium and cesium are generally suitable. fence, the preferred class of compounds can be presented by the formula RLi wherein R is a hydrocarbon radical selected from the class consisting of aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic radicals containing from 1 to 30 carbon atoms per molecule. Examples of these initiators include methyllithilm, n butyllithium, n amyllithium, n decyllithium, phenyllithium, naphthyllithium, p tolyllithium, 9 fluorenyllithium, cyclohexyllithium, cicosyllithium, and the like, with n butyllithium being highly preferred.The essential feature of these initiators is that they possess a carbon lithium bond which acts on the point of initiation for the polymerization.1The growth of the polymer is also propagated through the carbonlithium bond which becomes a part of the polymer at this stage.Of the resulting polymers obtained, substantially all have a lithium atom positioned at one end. The amount of catalyst employed depends primarily on the monomers to be used and the characteristics desired in the polymer produced. In general, an increased amount of catalyst leads to the production of a lower molecular weight polymer,whereas a reduced amount of catalyst has an opposite effect. Suitable polymers having a molecular weight in the range of 3,000 to about 100,000 can be readily prepared, ordinarily by using initiator levels in the range of about 33.3 to 1 millimole per 100 grams of monomer mhm . Of course, polymers of higher or lower molecular weights can be prepared by varying the initiator level. Thus, polymers of high molecular weights which may be viscous or solid can be produced by using an initiator level of approximately 0.25 mhm or less.Generally, the initiator level for this invention is commonly in the range of about 20 to about 5 mhm since a desired molecular weight range is from about 5,000 to about 20,000 for most amine terminated polymers. Formation of the polymers is generally carried out at a temperature in the range between 1000C and 1500C and preferably between 780C and 500C,with temperatures at the lower part of the range being desirable at this stage. The precise temperature of polymerization, of course, will depend to a large degree upon the particular reactivities of the monomers being reacted.The pressure wilZ generally be low, that is approximately 1 atmosphere or higher and is usually related to the monomer and solvent volatilities. For example with ethylene, higher pressures are encountered than with butadiene or styrene. The process or the polymerizations are generally carried out in a hydrocarbon or ether medium. Normally, the solvents or diluents are paraffins, cycloparaffins or aromatics con I nininn from 4 to 10 carbon atoms per molecule. Examples of solyents include n butane, n hexane, n heptane, isooctane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene, tetrahydro furan,dimethyl ether, and the like. The important considerations in selecting solvents are that they should be inert, they should have some affinity for the polymer formed, and they should not contain in their structure any active hydrogen atoms or any impuri ties having an active hydrogen atom such as water, alcohols, or acid groups which would have a tendency to act as a chain terminating or transfer agent. In accordance with the concepts of the present invention the anionically prepared polymers are reacted usually with a single polyisocyanate or a polyisothiocyanate monomer to produce end capped polymers having at least one unreacted isocyanate or isothiocyanate end portion. Th sl, through a series of steps, an amine group is substituted for the unreacted or free isocyanate or isothiocyanate end portion, thereby forming the amine terminated polymer.The actual structure of the amine terminated polymer contains the anionically prepared polymer connected to an amide or a thioamide group the result of the initial isocyanate or isothiocyanate group of the polyisocyanate or the polyisothiocyanate which has reacted with the polymer , a hydrocarbon group which is the R portion o the polyisocyanate or the polyisothiocyanate as set forth below, and the formed amine end group. The terms polyisocyanate and polyisothiocyanate are used in this specification in the sense that the compounds described by these terms are polyfunctional and, therefore, may react with two or more entities.The polyisocyanates and the polyisothiocyanates are preferably those compounds represented by the formula R N C X n where R can be an aliphatic or, preferably, an alkyl containing from 2 to about 20 carbon atoms, a cycloaliphatic or, preferably, a cycloalkyl containing from 4 to about 20 carbon atoms an aromatic containing from 6 to about 20 carbon atoms or combinations thereof, n is an integer such as 2 or 3, with 2 being highly preferred and X is a chalogen oxygen or sulfur . Examples of polyisocyanates include diphenyl diisocyanates, 2,4,4 triisocyanatediphenyl ether, triphenyl methane triisocyanate, benzene l,2,4 triisocyanate, naphthalene 1,3,7 triisocyanate and the like.Highly preferred diisocyanates include meta or para phenylene diisocyanate, diphenyl methane diisocyanates, bitolylene diisocyanates, dianisidine diisocyanates, isophorone diisocyanates, toluene diisocyanates, hexamethylene diisocyanate and pentenethy lene diisocyanate. Examples of polyisothiocyanates generally include compounds which are the same as the polyisocyanates but wherein, of course, a sulfur atom has been substituted for the oxygen atom. Thus, suitable polyisothiocyanates include diphenyl diisothiocyanates, 2,4,4 triisothiocyanate diphenyl ether, tri phenyl methane triisothiocyanate, and z and the like. Preferred diiso thiocyanates include meta or para phenylene diisothiocyanate, diphenyl methane aiisothiocyanates, bitolylene diisothiocyanates, dianisidine diisothiocyanates, toluene dilsothiocyanates, hexamethylene diisothiocyanates, and pentamethylene diisothiocyanates. Henceforth, in the specification, whenever reference is made to an isocyanate or polyisocyanate compound, it is to be understood that such reference also usually includes isothiocyanate or polyisothiocyanate compounds. The The amounts of polyfunctional isocyanates which may be used generally depend upon the particular system to be produced.For most systems, the equivalent ratio of the polyisocyanates to the alkali metal or lithium present in the polymers may range from leo 1 to about 20, while in other systems, the upper limit of the range may be in excess of 100. When a polyisocyanate is employed to react with the lithium terminated or base polymers, each polyfunctional isocyanate will sometimes react with more than one lithium terminated polymer, thereby coupling the polymers and forming a resulting polymer which does not contain an isocyanate on an end portion of the polymer.This situation generally cannot be avoided and,therefore, to achieve a fair amount of polymers which have at least one isocyanate end group, the equivalent ratio of one isocyanate end group and the equivalent ratio of the polyfunctional isocyanates to the lithium must be greater than i.ot Should the equivalent ratio be less than 1.0 but greater than 0.5, the resultant polymeric solution may contain and, when the equivalent ratio is 0.5 or less, the resultant polymeric solution will likely contain, some unreacted lithium terminated polymers.When the equivalent ratio is approxinately 2.0, statistical consideration reveals that when a diisocyanate is employed, approximately 50 percent of the polymers have an isocyanate end group.When a triisocyanate is employed with an equivalent ratio of 3.0, the amount of polymers which are terminated by at least one unreacted isocyanate group is increased to approximately 67 percent.In general, as the equivalent ratio increases, the percentage of isocyanate terminated polymers increases as well as the amount of completely unreacted or free polyisocyanates. Generally, an amount of polyisocyanate should be used so that at least 5 percent and,preferably, at least 20 percent of the polymers are terminated by at least one isocyanate group. An amount of 30 percent to about 65 percent or, above is highly desirable or highly preferred. Usually, as a practical matter, it is difficult to achieve amounts in excess of 65 percent of anionically polymerized polymers end capped with a free isocyanate group due to coupling. As should be apparent to one skilled in the art, the addition of polyfunctional isocyanates should be carried out rapidly to avoid excessive coupling. During the process of formation of the isocyanate end capped polymers, it is important that the reaction be carried out in an environment substantially free from active hydrogen compounds such as water, alcohol or acids so that the polymers are terminated by an isocyanate group. Hence, the process is usually carried out in an inert atmosphere such as in a nitrogen or helium atmosphere. The temperature range for the polyfunctional isocyanate reaction is generally between 100 C and 150 C., and preferably, between 780C and 700 C. It has been found that temperatures at the lower end of the preferred range produced better results, possibly since polyfunctional isocyanate consuming side reactions are reduced. XX The preparation of the end capped, anionically produced polymers will be Rore fully understood by referring to the 4 following examples. EXAMPLE I 1,2 POLYBUTADIENE To a clean, dry, nitrogen purged, 28 oz. beverage bottle was added 600 cc of purified tetrahydrofuran and 77.6 g of butadiene. After cooling to 200C, 1.52 cc of 1.64 molar 2.49 x 10 3 moles n butyllithium in a hexane solution was added and held at 20 C for 4 hrs., until the butadiene had polymerized.To 1this lithium polybutadiene, which was 85 percent 1,2 microstructure was rapidly added 5.92 cc of a 10 22 molar 7.21 x 10 3 moles toluene diisocyanate solution in toluene. The resulting polymer had an average molecular weight of 31,000. EXAMPLE II 1,4 POLYBUTADIENE To a clean, dry, 28 oz. beverage bottle was added 500600 cc of purified toluene, 98.1 g of butadiene and 1.43 cc of 1.75 molar 2.5 x 10 3 moles n butyllithium in a hexane solution. The bottle was stirred magnetically overnight at 250C. before rapidly adding 2.52 cc of 0.995 molar toluene diisocyanate 2.5 x lO moles . This solution was stirred for 1 hr. and the product was precipitated with methanol. The resulting 1,4 polybutadiene had a viscosity average molecular weight of 56,000 g mole and a vinyl content of ,about 10 percent. The above described polyisocyanate or polyisothiocyanate end capped polymers of the polymeric composition, according to the concepts of the present invention, are further reacted with an amide compound to give an imide type teminatd,,anion ically prepared polymer. Such amine terminated polymers htve becn found to be very stable or unreactive to moisture, impurities, and the like, and are stable for extended periods of time such as months and even years. Moreover, such amine terminated polymers can be shipped to various plants and stored before utilization.Additionally, the amine terminated compounds of the present invention are particularly suitable in processes wherein the precise stoichiometric relationship of the amine terminated compounds, with respect to reactant compounds as in the formation of block copolymers, is very important to the production of compounds which possess good physical properties. That is, due to the inherent factors involved in the production ot polyisocyanate end capped, anionically prepared polymers such as elastomers, the exact amount of end capped polymers which constitutes further reaction sites are unknown at the time of production and, hence, often in a continuous process cannot be readily determined by chemical analysis until after the next succeeding reaction step has been carried out. Thus, of f grade or poor products are often unintentionally produced and are difficult to avoid In such continuous processes. In the formation of block copolymers, knowledge of the specific amount of end capped or amine terminated polymers is very important when they are reacted with acid halides, imide and urea forming compounds or polymers. Desirable amides include those which, upon reaction with the isocyanate end capped polymer, produce an imide type structure which can then be hydrolyzed. Suitable amides include amides of ammonia or primary amines, lactams, sulfonic acid amides and sultams. Therefore, amides having the formulaEMI40.1 an amide of a primary amine, wherein R1 and R2 are preferably an aliphatic or an aromatic may be utilized along with the less desirable cycloaliphatic, as well as mixtures of aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic grows wherein R1 and R2 have from 1 to about 20 total carbon atoms and wherein X is oxygen or sulfur. A specific and preferred example is oleamide. Of course, R1 and R2 may simply be hydrogen.It is noted that amides of secondary amines, that is, N,N disbstituted amides cannot be used since they will not react with the isocyanate end capped polymers due to the lack of a hydrogen bonded to the nitrogen atom. Specific examples of amide compounds wherein X is an oxygen or a sulfur, R2 is a hydrogen and R1 is preferably a hydrogen or an alkyl include formamide, acetamide, stearamide, and the like. Examples wherein IR1 is preferably an alkyl or an aromatic and R2 is a hydrogen or an aromatic include acetanilide, benzamide and benzanilide.Another and a highly preferred class of amide compounds are the internal or cycloaliphatic amides such as the lactams. Generally, lactams having from 3 to about 16 total carbon atoms may be utilized. Preferred lactams include caprolactam and capryllactam that is, lactams of primary amino acids. Additionally, the sultams may be utilized. Of course, the lactams and the sultams must contain an N group. Additional amide type compounds can be utilized for the present invention whereinEMI41.1 is replaced by anEMI41.2 group, for example, the sulfonic acid amides. Similarly, in the lactams, theEMI41.3 group may be replaced byEMI41.4 to form a sultam of a primary amino sulfonic acid. A specific example includes benzene sulfonamide. Suitable solvents for the sulfonamide compounds include hexane and tetrahydrofuran. Generally, the above amide compounds are preferred over the sulfonic acid amide and the sultam compounds. Upon reaction of the amide type compounds with the isocyanate or isothiocyanate end capped polymer, i.e. polymerEMI41.5 an imide typeEMI41.6 structure is produced wheren the polymer terminal structure is generally as follows EMI41.7 tb SEP X SEP H SEP H SEP X tb SEP n SEP r tb Polymer SEP C N RtN C q Y Rl tb SEP o tb SEP X SEP tb SEP I SEP S tb SEP I SEP II tb Y SEP i. C SEP or SEP O, SEP wherein SEP R, SEP R tb where X is oxygen or sulfur and and R2 are as set forth above. Suct. terminal structure of the polymer for the purpose of the present invention, including the claims. is to be understood as an imide type structure and is an intermediate in the prod ction of the amine terminated polymer. To insure that many or most of the end capped, anionically prepared polymers are eventually converted to amine terminal ted polymers, generally, the mole ratio of an amide compound is desirably from about 1.0 to about 10 and preferably about 2 with respect to the unreacted isocyanate groups. The amount of polyisocyanate utilized to react with the anionically prepared polymer is generally in excess of an equivalent amount as from 1.1 to about 20 and preferably a mole ratio ot about 2 to insure that most all of the anionically prepared polymers are end capped, as well as to insure that a high proportion of such end capped polymers is produced.Thus, in the case of the preferred mole ratio, the amount of amide compound to an anionically prepared polymer will be 4 to 1 where diisocyanate compounds are utilized and will be 6 to 1 where triisocyanate compounds are utilized. Thus, when a triisocyanate is utilized, the reacted polymer may be terminate.with two amine groups. The addition of the amide compound was generally carriec out at a temperature range of about 780C to about 50 C and, preferably at the range of from about OOC to about 30 C. Of course, the temperature will generally vary according to the type of amide compound utilized. Generally, at temperatures below the lower broad limit, anionic polymerization becomes unfeasible. In the case where the particular type o aittide compound is a lactam, the addition temperature ,of the amide is desirable at the molten temperature of th lactam. After an imide type terminated polymer is formed, it is hydrolyzed to produce the amine terminated, anionically produced polymer. Hydrolysis, which will generally vary depending upon the type of amide compound, may usually be carried out from 25 C to about 100 C with a temperature of about 150C generally being preferred, especially when the amide is caprolactam. The mole ratio of water to the imide groups is from about 1.0 to about 10 and preferably about 2. A mole ratio in excess of or larger than 1.0 is preferred, of course, to insure a large amount of amine terminated polymcr and to reduce the amount of coupling occurring during hydrolysis of the imide. Thus, if the mole ratio of diisocyanate utilized is twice that of the expected anionically prepared chains, the preferred mole ratio of amide compound will be four and the preferred lower amount of water to the number of anionically prepared polymers will be eighty Of course, larger or smaller amounts may be utilized with good results. Upon hydrolysis, the amide comound is separated from the polymer and carbon dioxide is given off, thus, producing an amine terminated polymer.Generally, if the above ranges of amide compound and water are utilized, the amount of isocyanate end capped polymers converted to amine terminated polymers is usually a minimum of 60 percent although with the preferred pro cedure, conversions of greater than 90 percent are usually ob tained. When an excess of polyisocyanate material is employed, there will exist excess or free polyamine materials. The pre sence of such polyarnines is usually deletcrious to the properties ii of some of the copolymers, as for example, 1,2 polybutadiene nylon 6 block copolymer, while in other situations, its presence may be corrected by an additional amount of reactant, as for example, additional diacid chloride when diacid chlorides and diamines are added to make nylons in order to form the desired block copolymer . These are some of the reasons why it is generally undesirable to utilize a large excess of polyisocyanate, that is, above the preferred amount for the formation of the amine terminated polymers. The invention will be better understood by reference to the following examples.EXAMPLE IIIAMINE TERMINATED 1,4 POLYMm ADINE A clean, dry one half gallon reactor fitted with a paddle type stirrer was charged with 1500 g of butadiene hexane blend 25 wt. percent butadiene which had been dried to less than 50 ppm water by circulation through 3A molecular sieves.

A modifier 15.2 Ml of oetramethylethylenediamine was added to promote the formation of high 1,2 microstructure. The polymerization was initiated by the addition of 50.0 ml of 1.62 M n butyllithium in hexane and the temperature rose to 85 F. Cooling was maintained and the reaction temperature was held at 20 F for 4.5 hr. A sample was taken for analysis of the polybutadiene 87 percent 1,2 microstructure, intrinsic viscosity of 0.205 at 25 C in toluene . Then 14.3 ml of Hylene TM DuPont 80 20 2,4 2,6toluene diisocyanate was added rapidly with good agitation. A sample was taken for analysis and then 23.7 g of caprolactam in 125 ml 4O dry toluene was rapidly added. The reaction was stirred for 15 rin. at 200F, then 30 min. at 1800F. After cooling tc 50 F, 20 ml of distilled water was added followed by antioxidants. The gel permeation chromatography analysis indi cated 38 percent of the polymer was coupled or 62 percent amine terminated 1,2 polybutadiene present in the product. EXAMPLE V PILOT PLANT PREPARATION OF l ,2 AMINE TERMINATED POLYBUTADIENE A five hundred gallon stainless steel reactor fitted with a single contour blade turbine conforming to the reactor bottom was employed. The reactor was baffled at a level requiring 100 200 gallons of material to be effective. The reactor was cooled t6 approximately 00F by circulating coolant through the jacket. The reactor was then charged with 360 lbs. of dimethyl ether and 9.5 lbs. of 15 percent n butyllithium in hexane. A butadiene monomer, dried to less than 50 ppm water by circulation through a column packed with 3A molecular sieves, was metered into the reactor at a rate such that the temperature was maintained at 400F.After an initial exotherm to 48OF, the desired temperature was maintained and a total of 200 lbs. of butadiene was charged over 8 hr, A sample taken after completion of the butadiene addition showed 1,2 polybutadiene of greater than 97 percent 1,2microstructure and a dilute solution viscosity of 0.20 dl g on a 0.5 percent solution in toluene at 250C. To the active lithium polymer cement was added 8 lbs. of Hylene T DuPont 2,4 toluene diisocyanate over 2.3 min. with maximum stirring. After sampling for analytical study, 40 lbs. of 25 wt. percent caprolactam in benzene dried to less than 50 ppm water by circulation through 3A molecular sieves was charged over 5 min. The reaction mixture was diluted by the addition of about 200 lbs. of dry hexane, as lithe dimethyl ether was removed by distillation.Distillation was accomplished by heating the mixture at 2200F. The essentially all of the dimethyl ether and a portion of the hexane had been removed, 1,45 kg of distilled water was added and the reaction mixture was colled, stabilized with anti oxidants, and dropped into drums as a 54.5 percent solids cement. Titration of the polymeric base indicated that 49.5 percent at the material was amine terminated, in good agreement with the value of 51 percent non coupled material measured by gel permeation chromatography. E VI COMPARISON OF WOOD FLOUR FILLED, 1,2 poly Bd AND AMINE TERMINATED 1,2 POLY Bd Samples of resin were compounded in hexane solutior, 40 60 percent resin solids as indicated below. The mixing was done in a Kitchen Aid Mixer. Solvent was removed by drying in a vacuum at 50 C. Test specimens were cured 10 at 350 F in preheated molds. The physical properties measured are tabulated below SAMPLE NO. 1 2 1,2 Polybutadiene 100 Amine terminated 1,2 PBd 100Wood Floor 100 100Paraformaldehyde 1 1Dicup 40 7.5 7.5 40 percent dicumyl peroxide Flexural Strenght, psi 6160 10840Flexural Modulus, X 10 5, psi 5.90 5.10 Hardness, Rockwell E 68Izod impact, notched ft. lb in. 0.2 0.2 A significant improvement in flexural strenght was noted in the samples prepared with amine terminated 1,2 polybutadiene. The amine terminated polymers produced according to the present invention can be generally reacted with polyisocyanates and various polymer forming monomers or actual polymers to produce block copolymers which are generally processable at ambient temperatures and yet, upon curing, exhibit physical properties of the added polymer. Accorc3.inq to the concepts of the present invention, the amine terminated polymers described above can C . enerally be reacted under various conditions with amine reactive monomers and polymers to form block or graft copolymers. A preferred amine rcactilso compound is a lactam having from 3 to about 15 total carbon atoms. Highly preferred lactam s include caprolactam and capryllactam. When such lactams are polymerized, they will yield a nylon block copolymer which is readily processable at the processing temperature of the amine terminated polymer. Thus, when a nine terminated 1,2 or 1,4polybutadiene is used, the processing temperature will be ambient, whereas if amine terminated polystyrene is used, the processing temperature will be approximately 2500F to 400 F.However, when the butadiene portion of the nylon block copolymer is cured, the copolymer will exhibit physical properties largely representa tive of the nylon constituent of the block copolymer in contrast to the elastomer constituent. Another class of preferred amine reactive compounds in cludes the various aldehydes, ureas, and phenols to produce a copolymer constituent of urea aldehyde or phenol aldehyde. Depending upon the ratio of the amount of aldehyde to the other component utilized in the formation of urea aldehyde and phenolaldehyde, a block co polymer or a three dimensional graft copolymer A work will be produced. Due to the existence of multiple reactive vites on the phenols, the production of phenol formaldehyde co polymers invariably results in a graft or highly crosslinked network. The Block or graft copolymers formed exibit good processing properties at ambient temperatures as well as at temperatures well below the crosslinking temperatures of either the urea aldehyde or the phenol aldehyde constituent. t another class of amine reactive compounds which may be utilized in the preparation of the various polymers are the polyisocyanates or the polyisothiocyanates. The formulations utilized are generally similar, if not identical to those set forth above with respect to the end capping of the polymer Many other amine reactive compounds such as monomers and polymer exist as known to those skilled in the art. Representa tive classes of various amine reactive polymers are set forth in U. S. Patent No. 3,755,261 which is hereby fully incorporated by reference with respect to the general and specific types of amine curable prepolymers or polymers.As set forth by the reference, one representative class of polymers are the epoxy resins such as those described in the Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology, Volume 3 1965 , Pages 705 through 729. Yet another class of polymers which are amine reactive are the chlorosulfona ted polymers such as those set forth in U.S. Patent no. 2,723,257. Additionally, various chlorosulfonated monomers are also amine reactive and can, therefore, be reacted with the amine terminated polymer. A further class of amine reactive polymers are polymers which contain acid halide groups. Various monomers also con taining such acid halide groups may bt utilized to react with the amine terminated polymer and to form a polymer constituent thereonAnother amine reactive compound is the haloformate groups which may be contained by monomers or by polymers.Another group of amine reactive compounds includes monomers or polymers which contain anhydride groups which, upon reaction with an amine, result in an amide acid linkage and may further react to give an imide.Another polymer which may be reactive with the amine terminated polymers of the present invention are the organopolysiloxanes such as those described in U. S. Patent No. 2,938,010. Therefore, the present inve tion contemplates the production of block copolymers from the amine terminated polymer such as block epoxy copolymers, block urethane copolymers, block urea copolymers, block urethane ura copolymers and block polyimide copolymers. In the production of nylon block copolymers, the elasto meric amine terminated polymers described above are connected to a nylon polymers formed by the polymerization of lactams or the combination of diacid chlorides and diamines or prepolymers there of to give block copolymers which are readily processable and millable at ambient temperatures and possess excellent physical properties upon cure. Nylon block copolymers made utilizing nylon monomers and prepolymers are highly preferred since they tend to give better properties and are easier to prepare. The polymerization of the nylon constituent is generally via the anionic route and therefore extreme care must be taken to insure that the polymerization environment is substantially free of active hydrogen compounds such as water, alcohols, acids, and the like.Therefore, an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen is highly dangerous. The requited active hydrogen content in the reaction was generally be below 100 parts per million and preferably below to parts per million with a content below 5 parts per million i O . being highly preferred, especially with respect to the amount of water in the polymerization system such as a reaction kettle or the like. The reaction may be carried out according to bulk or suspension polymerization techniques with bulk polymerization being preferred for lactams and suspension polymerization being preferred for diacid chlorides and diamine. Moreover, since the amine terminated polymers described above tend to be very stable with respect to moisture, impurities and the like, the block polymerization process may be carried out well after the formation of the amine terminated polymer, such as for periods of six months, a year, and the like.Of course, before, before the block poly merization process can be commenced, the amine terminated polymer Whill have to be substantially purified of active hydrogen com pounds such as water as by utilizing a nitrogen purge or by heating to 50 100 C under a vacuum of less than about 5 mm of mercury. Lactams which may be utilized in the formation of the nylon constituent ndy contain from 2 to about 15 carbon atoms and preferably from 5 to 12 with caprolactam and capryllactam being highly preferred. The temperatures of the polymerization can generally range from about 50 C to about 260 C with a preffered range being from about 120 C to about 180 C. Usually, no pressure need be applied to the system and pressure of the system will be determined by the solvent system used as well as the polymeriz tion temperature. Desirable solvents include hexane, toluene and ne SO so long as they do not contain active hydrogens. Considering the use of diacid chloride and diamines, or salts of diacids and diamines to give a nylon constituent such as nylon 6,6 6,10 or 6,T, generally any diacid chloride and diamine compound may be used as well known to those skilled in the art.For example, the acid chloride of adipic acid may be utilized with hexamethylene diamine. Other preferred examples of acid chlorides are the aromatic dicarbonyl chlorides containing from 8 to 16 carbon atoms such as terephthaloyl chloride. Preferred examples of diamines include aromatic compounds having from 6 to 15 carbon atoms such as m phenylene diamine, 2,4 toluene diamine, methylene dianiline, and the like. The temperature range for copolymer preparation is usually much narrower than when utilizing lactams and generally ranges from about 200C to about 100C. Lower temperatures result in the diacid chloride and or the diamine compound precipitating out of solution whereas higher temperatures than the general range tend to hydrochlorinate the amine terminated polymer constituent such as polybutadiene.Although various nonactive hydrogen solvents may be utilized, dipolar aprotic solvents are preferred since they tend to pick up any hydrogen chloride formed during the polymerization. Preferred solvents include DMF dimethylformamide , DMAC dìmethylacetsmine and HMPA hexamethyl phosphoroamide along with an amount of toluene to maintain the amine terminated polymer in solution. The polymerization may be carried out under normal pressure conditions, that is, under the pressure generated by the solvent system at the polymerization temperatures. Although the polymerization of lactams can be carried out with just the amine terminated polymers and monomers since amine terminated portion of the polymer tends to act as an activater, observators may also be used. Toluene diisocyanate is an exemple s a specific and preferred coactivator. Usually, the polyis or anattes and the polyisothiocyanates can serve as activatory with didisocyantes or triisocyanates preferred. Generally, any activator may be utilized as well known to those skilled in the art. Examples of additional activators are set forth in U.S.Patent Wos. 3,017,392 and 3,028,369 which are hereby fully incorporates by reference with respect to such activators. The amount of coaactivator will generally depend upon the final average nylon molecular weight desirable with smaller amounts of coactivator being utilized to give higher molecular weights. To promote polymerization of the lactams to the nylon compound, a basic catalyst is utilized such as sodium hydride, a preferred catalyst. Generally, any sodium, potassium, rubidium, lithiu or alkaline earth compound capable of forming a metal salt of a lictam may be utilized as well known to those skilled in the art. The nylon constituent of the block copolymer may have a molecular weight range of from about 5,000 to about 50,000 with a range of from 10,000 to about 30,000 being preferred. The amount of the amine terminated constituent with respect to the nylon constituent may range from a very low amount such as 5 percent to a very high amount such as 95 percent and the block copolymer will generally exhibitt processing properties of the amine terminated constituent.Thus, if the amine terminated constituent is an r, or more specifically, either 1,2 polybutadiene or 1,4 polybutadiene, the block copolymer may be processed accordingl, Generally, the higher the amount of the amine terminated consti Ituent, the better are the processing properties with amounts of 1 120 percent and higher giving very good processing properties.A weight range of the nylon polymer constituent of from about 25 percent to about 80 percent is preferred. The nylon block copolymer can be cured, that is, crosse linked through the use of conventional cross linking agents such as organic peroxides with dicumyl peroxide being an example of a preferred peroxide. It has been found that when a particular class of organic peroxides is used to cure the nylon block copolymers, the copolymers exhibit even further improved properties, especially when the base polymer or polybutadiene constituent has a high vinyl content. These organic peroxides can be represented by the following formula CH3C R 2O OC R 2CH3 wherein R represent aryl or alkyl including cycloalkyl, aralkyl, alkaryl, etc., of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, inclusive.Typical R groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, hexyl, heptyl, decyl, dodecyl, octadecyl, phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, benzyl, phenethyl,naphthyl, methylnaphthyl, naphthylethyl, diphenyl, benzylphenyl, butylphenyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclohexylmethyl, cycloheptylethyl,methylcycloheptyl, and the like. The organic peroxides of the above formula may be diperoxides or mixed peroxides, that is, peroxides which have two different CH3C R 2 radicals. Specific examples include dicumyl peroxide, a preferred peroxide, ditertiarylbutyl peroxide, Vulcup, manufacturad by Hercules alpha , alpha , bis t butylperoxy diisopropyl benzene , tertiarybutyl cumyl peroxide, ditertiaryamyl peroxide, tertiarybutyl tertiaryamyl peroxide, tertiaryamyl cumyl peroxide, ditertiaryoctyl peroxide, bis 1,1 diphenyl ethyl peroxide, bis 1,1dicyclohexyl ethyl peroxide, bis 1 cyclohexyl 1 methyl ethyl peroxide also known as bis 2 cyclohexyl 2 propyl peroxide , bis 1phenyl 1 ethyl ethyl peroxide also known as bis 2 2 phenylbutyl peroxides, and the like.The symmetrical peroxides which have identical groups on each side of t paroxy oxygens are generally more available and therefore are preferred. However, mixed perox ides, when available, can be used very satisfactorily. Whether mixed peroxides or diperoxides of the above class are used to impart to the block copolyiners improved properties, which are generally more favorable than irt ordinary peroxides other than the above class were used, che eoxides used are ad vantageously those having a reasonably fast rate of decomposition at the temperature employed. The nylon block copolymers formed when cured possets good physical properties characteristic of nylon such as intact resistance, high abrasion resistance, tensile strength and tough ness, and can therefore generally Le used as an engineering or structural plastic having low flammability. Desired end uses, thus, include appliance housings, cabinets, rigid panels, and the like. If the amine terminated polymer is formed from the 1,4 polybutadiene microstructure and the block copolymer has a high nylon content as in excess of 75 percept, the block copolymer may be employed as textile fibers and as tire cord similar to the use of nylon. If the amount of nylon cortent is lower, the 1.4 polybutadiene nylon block copolymer can be utilized for hose flexible pipes, and the like. If the block copolymer contains 2 1,2 polybutadiene microstructure, it can be used for casters, gears, plastic pipe, and the like. Moreover, as with nylon polymers, various convelltional fillers and reinforcing agents may be added such as silica and the like. Various fibers such as wood, metal, rayon, etc., may also be added but they tend to greatly reduce the processability of the uncured polymer. The invention will be more fully understood by reference to the following examples which describe the pr varation of various polybutadiene nylon block copolymers. EXAMPLE VII 34.5 65.5 1,2 Polybutadiene Nylon 6 Block Copolymer The preparation of the block copolymer from an amine terminated polymer can be carried out in any reaction vessel capable of withstanding temperatures up to about 2000C, having provisions for mechanical stirring and capable of maintaining an inert atmosphere and small pressures. The starting materials of an amine terminated polymer and a preferred nylon monomer or prepolymer may be charged in any order as liquids, solids, melts, or combinations thereof. Of course, the starting materials must be dried, either separately or in combination to remove water and other low molecular weight impurities.Solutions or.liquids may be dried by contacting them with activated molecular sieves or activated alumina whereas solids and melts are preferably dried by subjecting them to a vacuum of less than about 2 mm of mercury at temperatures up to 1200C and preferably at a vacuum of less than 1 mm of mercury at 1000C for 5 to 16 hrs. To a stainless steel resin kettle 3E 500 roll capacity having a mechanical stirrer and a vacuum takeoff, was added 132 of a cement of 1,2 polybutadiene amine terminated polymer in hexane, approximately 73.5 percent solids, at a molecular weigh of about 14,700 g mole along with 150 g of flake caprolactam. The mixture was warmed in a warm water bcth from about 30 C to abou 50 C and a vacuum of 30 to about 80 mm of mercury applied to remove the bulk of the hexane.The resulting mixture was then heated from about 90 C to about 150 C in a wood s Metal Bath anl a vacuum of less than 2 mm of mercury was applied and maintained for a 16 hr. period with stirring. Nitrogen was then admitted to the resin kettle and a slight nitrogen purge maintained during the remainder of the preparation. To the stirred dry mixture was added 0.45 g of sodium hydride 58.1 percept dispersion in minera.oil, 11 rn mol . After 5 min. of mixing, 0.75 ml cf toluene diisocyanate Hylene TM, 5.27 m mol was added. The temperature was slowly raised to 1650C 1750c. Agitation was continued until the temperature reached 120 130 C and the mixture became too viscous to stir. The polymerization was carried out for at 165 175 C. Upon cooling, the copolymer was rertioved from size resin kettle and compounded by milling.The milling kccipe con tained 100 parts of the copolymer, 150 parts of silica 325 meat., 1.5 parts of Dow Corning Z6075 silane vinyltriacetoxy silana, an 2.0 parts of Dicup R, manufactured by Hercules dicumyl peroxide . After curing for 20 min. at 35009, the compounded block copolymer gave the following physical properties flexural strength of 16,210 psi, flexural modulus of 9.38 x 105 psi, Izod, notched on 0.38 ft.lbs per inch, Izod, unnotched o 4.2 ft.lbs per inch, Gardner impact strength of 3.7 inch lbs, heat distortion tempera ture at 264 psi of 2200C, and a Rockwell hardness E scale of 79 EXAMPLE VIII 20 80 1,2Polybutadiene Nylon 6 To a 500 m stainless steel resin kettle was added 50.2 g of amine terminated 1,2 polybutadiene having,69.7 percent solids in hexane. The hexane was stripped off by heating to 1000C under a stream of dry nitrogen.Then, 140 ml 140 g of dry caprolactam was added as a melt at 1000C to 115 C. The two components were stirred and 1.139 g of sodium hydride in mineral oil 40.7 g mole I sodium hydride or 0.028 mole sodium hydride was added. After 1 to 5 min. of stirring, 2.0 ml of toluene diisocyanate 0.014 mole of Hylene TM was added. After stirring for 5 re.in., the stirrer was removed from the reaction mixture and the temperature raised to 1600C 1700C and maintained for 3 hrs. The resulting sample was milled and a sample compounded.The compounded sample contained 100 parts of the nylon block copolymer, 80 parts of alumina trihydrate, 7.5 parts of 1 4 No. 704.71 glass fiber, 1 part of alpha , alpha bis t butylperox diisopropylbenzene, 1 part of 3 glycidoxypropyl trimethoxy silane Dow Corning , and 1 part of silicone oil DC 550 . The compounded material was cured for 10 min. at 3350F and gave the following properties a flexural strength of 7,650 psi, a flexural modulus of 5.09 x 105 psi andIzod notched in ft.lbs per inch of 0.29, an Izod unnotched in ft.lbs per inch of 2.5, a Gardner impacts in inch lbs of 2.25, a heat distortion temperature of 1910C at 264 psi and a RockwellE hardness of 34. EXAMPLE IX 30 70 1,2 POLYBUTADIENE POLYTOLUENEDIAMINE TEREPHTHALAMIDE A 1 liter resin kettle was fitted with a turbine swiire thermometer, nitrogen inlet and distillation head and was then charged with 4C.7 g of 1,2 polybutadiene amine terminated cement 73.5 percent solids in hexane along with 500 mL of toluene and 33.9 g 0.277 moles of 2,4 toluenediamine. The solution was heated to distill off the hexane and any water present. Upon size vapor temperature reaching 104 C, the mixture was cooled undad nitrogen to room temperature and then down to 15 C to 20 C or a dry ice carbon tetrachloride bath. A solution of 56.3 g 0.27 moles of distilled terephthaloyl chloride and 125 ml of dry 1.methylacetamide DMAC was prepared in n inert atmosphere dr box . This solution was placed in a 150 ml addition funnel all the traces of acid chloride was rinsed into the funnel with 25 llD of DMAC. The addition funnel was stoppered and capped bcfi ore exposure to air, The additlon funnel replaced the distillation head on the resin kettle and the DMAC solution was added, rapidly to the amine terminated 1,2 polybutadiene TDA solution suspension. The reaction temperature was maintained at 15 C to 20 C for 6 hrs. after the initial exotherm to 15 C. The reaction mixture was then allowed to warm to room temperature anc the polymer was then precipitated in methanol, collected by suction filtration and washed with ice water in a Waring Blender. The blended sus pension was treated with sodium carbonate to remove traces od I Cl and promote aggregation of the polymer dispersion. The polymer was collected by suction filtration, washed with water and then with methanol and dried in a vacuum for 16 hrs. at room temperature and then at 3 hrs. at 600C. A yield of 93.2 percent was obtained.A portion of the polymer was compounded as follows 50 g of the polymer, 75 g of silica 325 mesh , 2.0 g of dicumyl peroxide and 0.75 ml of vinyltriacetoxy silane. The compounded polymer was cured for 20 min. at 3500F and gave the following properties flexural strength of 8,720 psi, flexural modulus of 10.38 x 105 psi, Izod notched in ft.lbs per inch of 0.25, Izod unnotched in ft.lbs per inch of 1.0, Gardner impact in inch lbs of 1.5, heat distortion temperature at 264 psi of 250 C and a Rockwell E hardness of 95.5. Thermal gravametric analysis TGA of a sample of the cured, compounded polymer shows only 4 percent weight loss in either air or nitrogen up to 4 80C. Thus, a highly thermally stable thermoset resin has been produced. As apparent from the above physical properties, an engineering type thermoset was produced having an exceedingly high flexural modulus. The 1,2 polybutadiene nylon block copolymers of the present invention have also been found to produce good engineering rigid thermoset foams. Moreover, it has been found that such foamy may possess excellent flame retardancy by proper compounding. Addi tional advantages of such rigid foams include the facts that they may be made from putty like material and therefore are readily processable or moldable, they do not present dust problems, watercan readily be used as a blowing agent, thereby reducing health and safety hazards of processing, and that as a thermoset, relatively low processing temperatures such as below 300OF must,be utilized. In contrast, generally all conventional thermoplastic foams require a high processing and blowing temperature. For example, polycarbonates and polyphenylene oxides require a processing temperature of about 500 F to about 600 F. Considering thermoplastics which constitute the larges class of foams utilized, the foaming temperatures of polypropylene generally range from 340 F to 550 F, and for polyphenylene sulfides from 600 F to about 650 F. Considering the strenght of various thermoset foams,phenolics and urea formaldehyde tent to be friable and, therefore weak. Thermoset foams according to the present invention having good flame retardant properties are formed by utilizing conventional ring agents such as oxides or with other conventional curatives, for example, various sulfur curatives.as are well knowr to those skilled in the art, alouc with suitable and conventional flame reterdants, varouss surfactants to obtain good buble dispersion anc size, various conventional blowing agents, and various fillers or reinforcng agents.Additionally, a coreactive.monomer may or may not be added to the block copolymer. The block copolymer may generally comrise adiene rubber constitueent made from amonomer as set forth above, for example, from a conjugated diene monomer having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms with a preferred rubber constituent including 1,2 polybutadiene 1,4 polybutadiene 1,4 polysoprene and a copolimer of 1,4 butadiene and styrene. The nylon constituent may be mada from any nylon forming monomer as previously set forth, that is, the lactams, and preferably from caprolactan or capryllactam.The resulting thermoset foams may vary from rigid to semi rigid as well as highly flexible, non rigid foams by variation in the level and type of rubber curatives employed and t ie block copolymer composition. Additionally, thermoplastic rigid foams may also be prepared from the various block copolymers disclosed hereinabove when the amine terminated polymer portion of the copolymer is made from monomers via an anionic polymerization such as vinyl substituted fromatics or heteroaromatics, as set firth above. Of these various monomers, styrene, alpha methylstyrene, vinyltoluene and 4 t butylIstyrene are preferred. Such thermoplastic block copolymer ligid foams will require high processing and blowing tempera turn, characteristic of conventional thermoplastic foams.The nylon constituent of the rigid foams may be made from any of the above set forth monomers with caprolactam and capryllactam being prefe red. Moreover, the various compounds which may be utilized in th preparation of these rigid thermoplastic foams are the same such s the flame retardants, the surfactants, the blowing agents, and te like. However, when a rigid foam is prepared without utilX ing a coreactive monomer, a curing agent such as a peroxide type or a sulfur type is not required. The amount of the coreactive monomer for preparation of either the thermoplastic foams or the rigid thermoplastic foams basil upon 100 parts by weight of the block copolymer will be zero or nothing if a coreactive monomer is not utilized, or otherwise luiil range fron about 1 to about 150 parts and preferably fron about 1 to about 20 parts since the coreaction monomer genreally decreases the viscosity of the composition. If too much coreactive monomer is utilized, the foam becomes soft or non rigid, and exhibits reduced flame retardancy and generally lower physical properties. Specific examples of coreactive monomers include styrene, vinyltoluene, chlorostyrene, 4 t butylstyrene, diallyphthalate, and the like.The range of the curing agent, be it peroxide or a sulfur type curative, is from about 1 to about 40 parts with.from about 2 to about 6 parts being preferred. In general, any cor ventional peroxide curing agent may utilized as well known those skilled in the art with dicumyl peroxide being preferred.Should Dicup 40 be utilized, a l larger overall weight amount 13, generally utilized due, of course, to the fact that such peroxide contains only about 40 percent dicumyl peroxide by weight. Similarly, any conventional sulfur compound or sulfur cure system known to the art may also be utilized such as the following cure system. Parts 100 pts. rubber copolymer Sulfur 2.0 pts. Stearic acid 2.0 pts. Zinc Oxide 5.0 pts. Santocure iS 1.2 pts. N t butyl 2 benzothiazolesulfenamide Considering the flame retardant, generally from 0 to 150 parts and preferably from 50 to about 200 parts of any conventional flame retardant compound may be utilized. Specific examples include Thermoguard S 711, M and T Chemical Company antimony trioxide , Dow PR 300 BA decabromo diphenyl oxide , and alumina trihydrate. Generally, amounts at th lower end of the ranges are desired since, otherwise, the density tends to increase and the various physical properties tend to decrease. The general range of the surfactants is from 0.1 to about 5 parts with a preferred range of about 0.2 to about 2 partsThese ranges generally provide a good distribution of bubbles as well as bubble size whereas smaller amounts tend to produce a poor dispersion of cell size. On the other hand, excess amounts tend to cause collapse of the bbls or voids. Any conventional surfactant may be utilized either alone or in combination with each other and a specifically preferred surfactant is SF 1034, a silicone surfactant manufactured by General Electric Company. The general range of the blowing agent to produce the foam is from about 0.5 to about 50 parts by weight and preferably from about 1.0 to about 7.5 parts if a chemical blowing agent is utilized or preferably from 5.0 to about 20 parts if a physical blowing agent is utilized. Many conventional blowing agents may be utilized. Generally, for thermoset copolymer foams, high decomposition temperatures for effective gas yield wherein the decomposition temperature is 1500C or over are not preferred and compounds having a decomposition temperature of 17500 and over tend to be incompatible with the process. A preferred blowing agent is Nitrosan manufactured by DuPont, N,N dimethyl N,N dinitroso terephthalamide .Other blowing agents include azobisisobutyronitrile, p,p oxybis benzene sulfonyl hydrazine , azodicarbonamide in conjunction with various decomposition actiletors known in the art, or dinitroso pentamethylenetetramine in conjunction with various decomposition activators known in the art. Azodicarboxylates are not desired as chemical blowing agents since they tend to undergo an ene reaction with double bonds from polybutadiene or other unsaturated portions of the amine terminated polymer at temperature lower than their effective gas yield temperatured.In general, the effective gas yield temperalture of the chemical blowing agents or the boiling point of the physical blowing agents are generally equel to or preferably lower than the temperature at which the particular peroxide has a half life of about C minutes or over as Activators may be utilized with certain chemical blowing agents to lower the decomposition es effective gas yield temperatures of the chemical blowing agent to the desired temperature range as is well known to those skilled in the art. Generally, physical blowing agents which are preferred for thermoset foams are those which are compatible or dispersable within the resin formulation and do not interfere with the free radical cure of the resin. As for exemple, pentane, hexane, heptane, water, and the like, as well as injected inert gases such as nitrogen, neon, and argon. For thermoplastic copolymer foam the chemical blowing agents preferred are those with effective gas yields an decomposition temperatures from about 100 C to about 225 C. Activators known to those well skilled in the art may be utilized to obtain the desirable gas yield at the processing temp eratures of the thermoplastic copolymers. Generally, those chemi cal blowing agents, wth or without activators, which are utilized in conventional thermoplastic foams are preferred.The azodicar boxylates may also be used since the the lmoplastic copolymers described above do not contain double bonds which would readily undergo an ene reaction. The physical blowing agents which areI preferred for thermoplastic copolymer foams are generally those cited above for thermoset copolymer foams, as well as the various common and conventional Freons that is, partially or totally fluoronated and sometimes partially or totally chloronated hydrocarbons having a bowling point of less than 1000C at 760 mm of mercury , methylchloride , ethylchloride, methylene chloride and chloroform.Further examples of conve ntional chemical and physical agents which may be utilizedr are set forth in the following articles which are hereby fully incorporated by reference. Description of Ideal Blowing Agents , H. R. Layman, ModernPlastics Encyclopedia 1971 , p. 158 et seq. and A SelectionGuide to Blowing Agents for Structural Foam MoldIng , R. C.LaClair, Plastic Technology, March 1976 , p. 31. The general range of the fillers or reinforoing agents is from about 0 to about 150 parts and preferably from about 0 to 50 parts. Usually, amounts in excess of these ranges are not de sirable since the formulations are rather stiff and do not readily flow under the internal gas pressure to give good foams. Various conventional fillers, well known to those skilled in the art, may be utilized such as silica, alumina, chopped glass fibers, and th like. The flame retardant rigid foam utility of the 1,2 polybutadiene nylon block copolymers will better understood from the folowing examples and data. EXAMPLE X 1,2 PBd Nylon 33 67 100 pts.

The urea aldehyde and the phenol aldehyde compounds and the like constitue another class of monomers, propolymers and polymers which are amine reactive and can be utilized to produce largely graft copolymers when reacted with the amine terminated polymers, with the monomers and propolymers being highly preferred due to ease of preparation and better physical properties. Considering now the non amine terminated constituent, generally, any condensation polymer can be used. For example, in lieu of the formaldehyde portion of the urea formaldehyde constituent, any linear alkyl aldehyde can be utilized having from 1 to about 15 carbon atoms such as acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, .n butylaldehyde, n valderaldehyde, n caproaldehyde, n heptaldehyde and the like. Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are highly preferred.Additionally, furfuryl aldehyde and hexamethylene tetramine may also be used. With respect to the urea compound portion of the constituent, generally, urea and melamine can be utilized and are preferred. Urea having small hydrocarbon substituents, that is, from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, may also be utilized such as 1,3 dimethyl urea and 1,3 diethyl urea as well as urea alcohols having 1 to 5 carbon atoms such as dimethylol urea. With respect to the phenolic compound, generally any phenol type compound having 2 of the 3 ortho and para positions open may be utilized including, of course, phenol. Thus, alkyl phenols such as butyl phenol, the cressols, the dihydric phenols such as resorcinol, catechol and quinol, may be utilized as well as many other compounds. Of course, a substituted phenol having any substituted group which would promote other reactions or inter fere with the desired polymerization is not desired. Considering the polyvinyl alcohols, any of the polyvinyl alcohol polymers or copolymers which are reactive with aldehydes or ketones to form acetals or ketals may be used. Examples of suc reactive aldehydes and ketones may be found in Polyvinyl Alcohol by C.A. Finch, Ed. pp 14 202, John Wiley and Sons, New York, New York 1973 , which As hereby incorporated by reference. Most preferred are the aliphatic aldehydes having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, particularly formaldehyde,. acetaldehyde or butyraldehyde. In the formation of urea aldehyde type block copolymers or the phenol aldehyde type block copolymers, aldehydes such as the chemically active formaldehyde and the less active acetalde byde with react with the amine compound of the amine terminated polymers. The remaining portion of the block copolymer may be formed largely in accordance with conventional practics.Thus, under the influence of either acid or base catalysts, phenol type compounds can be reacted with aldehyde type compounds to give phenol aldehyde copolymers. The first step in the reaction is generally the addition of aldehydes to the ortho or para position of the phenols and, of course, at least 2 free positions are required on the phenol compound in order to permit polymerisation. The next step is the novolac formation in which low molecular weight polymers are formed, generally in the presence of an acid catalyst. In the next step or resole formation, the methylol phenols can condense through formation of either methylene linkages or other linkages in the presence of alkaline catalysts and more aldehyds. In the last stage, decomposition of the ether bridges or methylene bridges yields the copolymer. Due largely to the random reaction and the presence of often more than two reactive positions on the phenol, graft copolymers are generally formed having high molecular weights and, therefore, are rarely processed. Due to the formation of resoles and novolacs, the production of phenol aldehyde copolymers can be made by one stage or two stage processes. In the production of a one stage copolymer, all the necessary reactants such as phenol, aldehydes, catalysts, and the like are charged into a resin kettle and reacted to gether. Any conventional alkaline catalyst can be utilised and the mole ratio of aldehydes such as formaldehyde to phenol is about 1.25 2.15 to 1. In the two stage process, the resins are made utilizing any conventional acid catalyst and only apart of the necessary aldehyde is added to the kettle utilizing mole ratio of about 0.8 to 1.The rest is added d at a later point in time, of ten in the form of hexamethylenetramine, which decomposes in the final curing stcp with heat and moisture present to yield formaldehyde and ammonia the latter acts as a catalyst for curing With respect to the formation of uea type aldehyde copolymers, these can generally be formed according to conventiona practice once the amine terminated polymer has been reacted with an aldehyde such as formaldehyde. Although the polymerization utilizing urea or melamine will be discussed, generally the other urea type monomers set forth above can be polymerized in.a similar manner..Initially, the aldehyde type compound reacts with either urea or melamine first by addition to form methylol compounds and then by condensation in reactions much like those of phenol and formaldehyde. Usually, the production of the amino resins is similar to that of the phenol aldehyde type resins. The mole ratio of aldehyde to melamine may be from about 1.0 3.0 to 1 whereas for urea, the ratio is from about 1.0 1.5 to 1. The temperatures of polymerization are generally from about 90 C to about 1000C for phenol formaldehyde actions and from about ambient temperatures to about 600C for urea or melamine aldehyde reactions. Normally, the only pressure is that generated by the solvent system. Since the urea or melamine type system also tends to produce graft copolymers, the phenol copolymers or the urea copolymers will be branched and, therefore of very high molecular weights, such as from about 50,000 to ss 300,000. plus, or they will be crosslinked. It has been found that the range of the amine polymer constituent such as polybutadiene with either the urea aldehyde type or phenol aldehyde type copolymer can range from about 5 percent to about 95 percent with from 25 percent to about 75 percent being preferred. The amine terminated phenol aldehyde block copolymer generally has the properties of a thermoset and may be used as melding resins for potting compounds due to thei good dielectric properties. Other Uses are laminating resins, bending resins, coatings, adhesives, and tEte like.The amine terminated urea aldehyde type block copolymers may be utilized as molding resins, adhesives, laminating resins, and the like. Generally, either type cf block copolymer may incorporate various filling and reinforcing agents such as silica, glass, and the like, with the urea aldehyde compounds also often being cellulose filled.Additionally, block copolymers according to the present invention tend to form smother finishes when the amine terminated constituent is an elastomer such as polybutadiene. Moreover, the phenolic aldehyde block copolymers are will suited as curatives for contact achasive formulations, replacing alkyl su,bstituted phenolic curative compounds which arc utilized in conventional ad hesives.The invention will be better understood by reference to the following examples. EXNLE XIII 72 25 1,2 POLYBUTADIENE UREA FORMALDEHYDE A 2 liter resin kettle equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, nitrogen inlet and distillation head was charged with 294 g of a hexane cement of amine terminated 1,2 polybutadiene having a molecular weight of about 25,000 50.6 percent solids or 150.0 g polymer .

This mixture was stirred to dissolve and than 100 ml of formalin 37 wt percent or 40 g CH2O charged ms added. After stirring vc mix well, 60 g of sodium hydroxide and 94.1 g of molten phenol ol were added. The entire mixture was heated with stirriny to reflux 630C for 2 1 2 hr. The initial rose white color faded to s1 white during the first 30 min. The apparatus was modified by the addition of a Dean Stark water separator between the resin kettle and the reflux condenser and water was removed by azeotropic distillation. After 3 hrs., 1.0 g of DABCO 1,4 Diaza 2 2 2 bicyclooctane was added and reflux with water re moval was continued. After 19 hrs., 50 ml of water had been removed the reaction was cooled and 50 ml 20 g CH2O of formalin was added.The reaction was again heated to reflux and after a total reflux time of 20.5 hrs., an additional 1.0 g of sodium hydroxide was added. At the end of 45 hrs. reflux, the total water collected was 115 ml. The product was isolated by coagulation in isopropanol, washed twice with methanol and dried ill vacuo. The yield was 138.5 g 67.7 percent of materials charged . The dried stock was mixed on a two roll mill to insure homogeneity and then compounded and cured as shown below.

When 100 parts of resin was compounded with 100 parts of wood fiber and 1.2 parts of Dicup R, and then cured for 3 hrs. at 3000F, a Rockwell E hardness of 46 was obtained.When another sample was cured for 20 mins. at 3500F, aRockwell E hardness of 46 was also obtained. A particular end use of the 1, 2 polybutadiene urea formaldehyde copolymers or the 1,2 polybutadiene phenol formalde hyde copolymers prepared from the amine terminated polymer as described above is a waterproof adhesive material for bonding various items together such as wood to wood, wood to metal, metal to metal, and the like. In general, such copolymers are prepared as hereinabove described and may contain from 5 percent to about 95 percent of the 1,2 polybutadiene constituent. Amounts in excess of 95 percent result in poor adhesion. A preferred amount of the 1,2 polybutadiene constituent ranges from about 25 percent to about 75 percent. Other elastomer constituents may also be used but polybutadiene is preferred due to economic reasons.Concerning the condensation polymer portion constituent, generally any condensation polymer can be used. The urea formaldehyde or the phenol formaldehyde elastomeric copolymer adhesives of the present invention are ideally suited for tailor made operations in that the copolymers are of putty like consistency and therefore are easily handled and processed. Such copolymer adhesives furthermore obviate any dust problems normally encountered with conventional urea formaldehyde adhesives and also exhibit excellent water resistance. The adhesive utility of 1, 2 polybutadiene urea formalde hyde copolymers as well as 1, 2 polybutadiene phenol formaldehyde copolymers will be better understood by the following example. EXAMPLE XVI PREPARATION OF 1,2 POLYBUTADIENE PHENOL FORMALDEHYDE ADHESIVE COPOLYMER 25 Percent PBd 75 Percent Phenol formaldehyde A 200 g sample of amine terminated 1,2 polybutadiene in hexane 50.fi percent solids, or 101.2 g of polymer made in accordance with the above disclosure was added to a resin kettle equipped with a mechanical stirrer. The kettle was heated to drive off some of the hexane arid 1 liter of toluene was added. The solvent was then distilled until a vapor temperature of 940C to 960C was achieved. The kettle was then cooled below 700C and 200 ml of formalin 40 percent formaldehyde in water , and 2.0 g of sodium hydroxide was added.The solution was heated to 700C 800C for 30 mins. under total reflux , and 188.2 g of molten phenol and 2.0 g of DABCO diazal2w2 2 bicyclo octane were added. The kettle was stirred overnight, then fitted with a Dean Stark trap and heated to remove 100 ml of water, cooled, and then an additional 100 ml of formalin was added. The kettle was ref fluxed overnight to remove an additional 200 cc of water. The solution was dried under a vacuum to give 341.2 g of copolymer 83.5 percent yield based on charged materials . To 5 g of dried copolymer was added 10 g of toluene and 0.1 g of dicumyl peroxide. Several segments of wood tongue depressors 3 in. long, 13 16 in. wide, 3 32 in. thick were glued together with a 1 in. overlap. The adhesive was cured for 3 hrs.at 1500C un der various pressures and the adhesive strength determined. Similarly, a 75 25 percent 1,2 PBd phenol formaldehyde adhesive and a 75 25 1,2 PBd urea formaldehyde copolymer were prepared and used to glue the tongue depressors together utilizing a dicumyl peroxide cure. The results are set forth in Table II.

EPOXY COPOLYMRS As previously noted, the abovs described amine terminated polymers can be readily reacted with various epoxy forming monomers or prepolymers to yield either block copolymers, graft co copolymers, or mixtures thereof. That is, if the amine terminated polymers are reacted with solely epoxy forming monomers or with solely epoxy prepolymers, typically containing epoxide end groups uc as acid generated epoxy compounds, the end portion of the aAine terminated polymer will react with the epoxide end groups and form a block copolymer, usually of the ABA type structure wherein A is the amine terminated polymer.However, should epoxy monomers or the epoxy prepolymer also contain a conventional epoxy cueing agent, largely graft copolymers will be formed wherein the epoxy polymer constitutes the backbone and the amine terminated polymer constitutes the pendant portions or branches. As their known to those skilled in the art, the epoxy curing agents add to the epoxy ring generating a hydroxyl group which can then further react with more epoxy groups to extend the molecular weight. Of course, the presence of poly epoxy compounds will result in the production of a highly branched and eventually crosslinked material.The amine terminated polymer, by virtue of its primary amine group, is a curing agent for epoxy compounds and will, thus, be bound to the epoxy resin constituent. generally, unless exceedingly large amounts of an epoxy curing agent are utilized, the resulting composition will contain a mixture of epoxy graft copolymers, epoxy block copolymers, as well as epoxy copolymers which have blocked to at least one end thereof an amine terminated polymer, as well as amine terminated polymers grafted onto at least one point of the epoxy copolymer backbone. Generally, any epoxy forming monomers or epoxy prepolymers which can react with an amine group may be utilized in the present invention. Various epoxy forming monomers or prepolymers which may be utilized are those described in the Encyclopedia ofPolymer Science and Technology, Interscience Publishers, New York 1967 Volume 6, Pages 212 through 221, which is hereby fully incorporated by reference. Examples of further epoxy prepolymers or resins are set forth in the Handbook of Epoxy Resins, McGraw Hill,New York 1967 by H. Lee and K. Neville, Chapters 2 and 3, which is also fully incorporated by reference. Desirable epoxy prepolymers or resins are those made by the condensation reaction of epichlorohydrin with bisphenol A 2,2 diphenylol propane .As well known to those skilled in the art, generally, an excess of epichlorohydrin is used to leave epoxy groups on the end of the polymer. In lieu of bisphenol A, other hydroxyl containing compounds may be utilized including resorcinol, hydroquinone, the various diols such as ethylene glycol, 1,4 butane diol, 1,3 propane diol, glycerol, and novalac resins derived from phenol and aldehydes.Epoxides formed by the action of peracids or peresters on olefinically unsaturated compounds may also be utilized. Examples include epoxidized soy bean oil, butadiene diepoxide, dicyclopentadiene diepoxide, cyclohexene oxide or epoxidized castor oil.Although epoxides other than those derived from epichlorohydrin may be utilized, such as aliphatic epoxides, they tend to be css,stl and, thus, are less desirable as a practical matter. The equivalent weight of the epoxy resin per unreacted epoxy group is generally in excess of 40 and preferably in excess of 80. The resins may be made in any conventional manner and specific examples or some desired epoxy resins which are availlable on a commercial basis are those manufactured by the Shell Chemical Company under the trademark of EPON, specifically, as Epon Resins 812, 871, 872, 828, 1004, 152, 154 and 1031. The amine terminated epoxy polymer compositions, whether block, graft, or mixtures thereof, are very readily formed simply by adding the amirie terminated polymers to epoxy prepolymer resins ,and mixing at a temperature above the softening temperature of the epoxy resin, as from about ambient temperature to about 200 C, or ,at room temperature in a solution. Alternatively, the epoxy resin may be formed in situ by adding amine terminated polymers to epoxy forming. monomers along with any other desirable additives such as epoxy catalysts, epoxy curing agents, and the like. arally, the in situ epoxy polymerization, as well as the reactio between the epoxy prepolymers or resins and the amine terminated polymers, proceeds at ambient temperatures. Heat may be applied t increase the reaction rate as well as to cure the epoxy polymers.A suitable temperature range, therefore, extends from ambient temperatures to about 2000C with a preferred range being from about 500C to about 150 C. The amount of, epoxy polymer based upon the total weight of the copolymer composition, that is without any crosslinking, may range from as little as 1 percent by weight up to about 95 percent by weight with from about 2 percent to about 75 percent being preferred and is readily controlled simply by adding a desirable amount of epoxy forming monomers or epoxy copolymer resins of a known equivalent weight to a desired or calculated amount of amine terminated polymer.Although the epoxy copolymers are readily processable at ambient temperatures in that they may be milled, extruded, injection molded, and the like, upon curing, they generally exhibit the physical properties of cured epoxy polymers. Thus, copolymers having a very low content of epoxy resin therein,such as 1 percent or more, exhibit good adhesion properties whereas copolymers having a very high amount of epoxy resin, such as 80 or 90 percent, exhibit high impact strength. Copolymers having an epoxy content between the values, vary accordingly in their physical properties. The properties will also tend to vary a bit with regard to the polymer constituent of the amine terminated polymer.Although any of the polymers may be utilized as set forth above, amine terminated polymers made from conjugated dienes having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms and desirably from 4 to 8 carbon atoms are preferred with butadiene and isoprene being highly preferred.Additionally, vinyl substituted aromatic compounds are also preferred with specific preferred examples of monomers being styrene, vinyltoluene, alpha methylstyrene and 4 t butylstyrene. Additionally, copolymers made from the conjugated dienes and the vinyl substituted aromatics are also desirable with a highly preferred copolymer being from styrene and butadiene. When a flexibl amine terminated polymer is utilized such as 1,4 polybutadiene wit a high amount of epoxy resin constituent such as 75 95 percent, the copolymer cured through the epoxy seqments exhihits good il pact resistance and flexibility.In contrast, when the amine terminated polymer constituent is easily cured to a rigid network such as l,2 polybutadiene, the epoxy copolymer may be cured in both of its constituent phases to give a iard, rigid, thermoset plastic. If the amine terminated polymer constituent is prepared rom thermoplastic type monomers, such as vinyl substituted aromatics and vinyl substituted heteroaromatics, the epoxy copolymer can be cured in the epoxy constituent phase and the resultant cured copolymer will contain thermoplastic domains which will act predominantly as reinforcing fillers at temperatures up to the softening point of the thermoplastic amine terminated polymer. If the epoxy constituent of the copolymer is formed in situ, suitable amounts of conventional catalysts and curing agents may be utilized. For example, based upon 100 parts by weight of the epoxy polymer, from 0.1 to 4.0 parts of a curing agent may be used. Typical curing agents include polyamides, polysulfides, urea and phenol formaldehyde, as well as polyamines, and preferably polycarboxylic acids or acid anhydrides. Examples of common or conventional curing agents are set forth in the handbook of Epoxy Resins by Lee Neville, Supra., particularlb in Chapters 5 through 12 which are hereby fully incorporated by reference.Examples of specific and desirable agents includeNadic methylanhydride methyl 2,3 dicarboxy 1 2 2 bicycloheptene anhydride , phthalic anhydride, maleic anhydride, succinic anhydride, pyromellitic dianhydride, benzophenonetetracarboxylic diana hydride, trimellitic anhydride, hexacloro 2, 3 dicarboxy 1 2 2 bi cycloheptane anhydride the polymethylene diamines e.g.,H2N CH2 n NH2 , wherein n is 2 to 15 and preferably 2 to 6 xylene diamines polyamines from ethylene imide e.g., H2N CH2CH2NH n CH2CH2NH2 , where n is 2 to 15, with an n value of 2 to 5 being highly preferred, m phenylene diamine, 4,4 methylene dianiline, diaminodiphenylsulfone, hexamethylene tetramine, dimethylol urea, urea formaldehyde resins, melamine, and phenolformaldehyde resins.The cure, as set forth in Lee and Neville, generally occurs through coupling or condensation reactions of any of the hydroxyl groups contained in the backbone of the formed epoxy polymer. Conventional catalysts may be utilized to promote the in situ polymerization of the epoxy forming monomers, such as benzyl dimethylamine 1,4 diaza 2 2 2 bicycloocatne, tri n alkanol amines with triethanolamine N CH2CH2Oii 3 being highly preferred, Lewis acid and complexes thereof, and complexes of BF3 e.g., BF3, diethyl ether . Moreover, any of the catalysts may be utilized which are set forth in Lee and Neville, Supra., Chapter 13, which is hereby fully incorporated by reference. Various conventional additives may be utilized such as various colorants, diluents, flexibilizers, stabilizers, fillers, and the like. Conventional fillers include glass powders, metal powders, various silicas, and fibres to which the epoxy materials have good adhesion and produce composites with excellent physical properties.Is desired, carbon black may be added. Moreover, various coupling, agents may be used in conjunction with the fillers. Examples of specific silanes include N beta N vinylbenzylaminoethyl gamm aminopropyltrimethoxysilane hydrogen chloride, 3 chloropropyitri methoxysilane, 3 glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, N 2 aminoethylN 2 aminoethyl 3 propyltrimethoxysilane, and vinyltriacetroxy si lane. Generally, the preparation or addition of the various compounds, curing agents, catalysts, fillers, and the like, may take place in a suitable mixing vessel such as a Brabender or the like wherein the various compounds are simply mixed, with the formation of the copolymers being carried out at ambient temperatures, if desirable. In accordance with generally accepted procedures for the preparation of epoxy polymers, there is no need for solvents although, if desired, a non polar solvent such as toluene may be utilized. After mixing, the toluene is generally stripped as by heating or applying a vacuum. Although a chemical bond between the amine group and the epoxide group is formed during the preparation of the copolymers, discontinuous phases do exist between the generally polar epoxy portion of the polymer and the generally non polar amine terminated portions such as a rubber or vinyl compound. However, the compatibility of the two phases is generally good. In addition to the epoxy cure, common and conventional curing agents may be utilized to crosslink a rubber type amine 1terminated polymer. Thus, sulfur compounds, organic peroxide compounds such as dictimy l peroxide, and the like, may he utilized to cure the amine terminated polymer when it is made from the preferred rubber type monomers. Generally, a curing agent is selected such that it curs in the same general temperature range as the epoxy curing agent. Of course, due to the hiqhly cross linking nature of t epoxy copolymers with crosslinkes establish ing through both the amine polymer as well as the epoxy polymers, the final product is highly gelled and, hence, is a thermoset resin. The epoxy copolymer may generally be use in the same applications as epoxy polymers, such as surface coating materials, wherein toughness, adhesion and chemical resistance are required, with fillers such as glass fibers to make glass fiber reinforced articles for electrical insulating Items and the like. In addi tion to casting, potting, encapsulation and embedment techniques as practiced with epoxy resins, the copolymers, due to their great ease of processability at ambient temperatures, may also be used for extruding, injection molding, blow molding, and the like. The invention will be better understood by the following examples. A copolymer of an amine terminated 1,2 polybutadiene epoxy resin was prepared by mixing 16 g of Shell p pon 1004 epoxy resin with 100 g of an amine terminated 1,2 polybutadiene pre pared as set forth in J xample V at 90 1000C for 30 mins. Based upon the amine content of the amine terminated 1, 2 jolybutadiene and the equivalent weight of the Epon 1004, there were two epoxy groups charged for each amine present. This copolymer Dienoxy A was then utilized in the formation glass fabric laminates and in the preparation of a 1,2 polybutadiene graft epoxy copolymer. GLASS FABRIC LAMINATES The following procedure was utilized to prepare glass fabric laminates. A dip was prepared by dissolving the indicated 1,2 polybutadine resin in toluene to give 30,percent solids. The dicumyl peroxide was dissolved at. this time. The below identified silane coupling agent was added and dispcrsc.d in the dip by shak ing. Strips of glass fabric Burlington 7781 were cut 3 in.wide by 38 in. iong with the warp threads stronq direction running across the narrow dimension. The glass fabric strips were weighed, then passed slowly throuqh a shallow trouqh containing the dip. The excess dip was removed by wiping the impregnated fabric strip with parallel aluminum rods separated by a 0.08 inch gap. After air drying to remove most of the solvent, the impregnated fabric strips were dried in vacuo at room temperature for 3 hrs. Test specimens were molded by laminating ten plies of prepared with all warp threads laid in parallel. The samples were cured 6 min. at 3500F in a rehcated positive pressure mold. The flexural test samples were cut from the cured laminate such that the warp direction ran the length of the sample..

It should be tested that the blend of Dienoxy A copolymer with the additional diglycidylether of bisphenol A DGESA and the anhydride curative system formed a stable dispersion while a blind of 1,2 polybutadiene with DGEBA and the anhydride curative system rapidly separated into two phases. 1,2 POLYBUTADIENE EPOXY RESIN COPOLYMER The indicated quantities of Dienoxy A and DGEBA were mixed together at 95 1100C using a Cowles dissolver. After cooling to 75 800C, the required Dicuinyl peroxide and anhydride curatives were mixed in again using the Cowles dissolver. Mixing time, after the addition of the curatives, was less than 15 min. moles were cured 4 hrs. at 850C followed by 16.5 hrs. at 145 C to insure cure of both constituents.

The reaction between the amine end group of the amine terminated polymer and the isocyanate group of either the urea forming monomers or the urea polymer having a free isocyanate end group thereon, generally occurs spontaneously and at room temperature. The rate of forming the chemical bond between the two constituents of the block can, of course, be readily increased by heating to any suitable temperature such as to approximately 1500C Various urea block copolymers can be tailor made simply by controlling the amount of the urea forming monomers or the urea polymer added to the amine terminated polymer.Generally, suitabl polymers are produced wherein the urea block copolymer contains from about 5 percent to about 95 percent by weight of urea based upon the total weight of the block copolymer and preferably from about 25 percent to about 75 percent by weight. In such block copolymers, the favorable properties of polyurea such as high modulus are usually retained. Such block copolymers may contain various additives, colorants, fillers, antioxidants, etc., and the like, as well known to those skilled in the art. For example, the urea block copolymers may be filled with carbon black, silica, etc. The reaction is desirably carried out in any suitable solvent such as toluene, hexane, tetrahydrofuran, and the like. The urea constituent of the block copolymer is prepared by reacting a polyisocyanate with a dlaiuine or water. Generally, the diamines are preferred since reaction with water proceeds at a slower rate and requires the use of a catalyst. The poly I isocyanate or the polyisothiocyanate has the same formula as set forth above with regard to the forration of the amine terminated polymer and, preferably, in order to avoid crosslinking and the formation of a gel, is a diisocyanate or a diisothiocyanate. Of the various aliphatic types of diisocyanates, the alkyl, cycloalkyl, and aromatic alkyl are prcX rred. Suitable diamines are represented by the formula 2N R N112 where R is an aliphatic, preferably an alkyl containing from 2 to about 20 carbon atoms, a cycloaliphatic, preferably a cycloalkyl contain ing from 4 to about 20 carbon toms, or an aromatic containing from 6 to about 20 carbon atoms, or combinations thereof. Exam ples of specific diamines include ethylenediamine, tetramethylene diamine, pentamethylenediamine, ortho phenylenediamine, para phenylenediamine, 2,6 toluenediamine, 4,5 diethyl ortho phenyl diamine, and meta xylylenediamine.Preferred diamines include hexamethylenediamine, meta phenylenediamine, 2,4 toluenediamine, methylene bis ortho chloroanilinc , i.e., MOCA and methylene dianiline The amount of diamine utilized with regard to the polyisocyanate or diisocyanate generally varies on an equivalent basis from out 0.8 to about 1.2, with a preferred range being fror about 0.95 to about 1.05. These ranges include any available polymer a,ii ines and polyamines remaining from the amine terminated polymer synthesis. Should the equivalent ratio be below the general ranee or above it, usually some P U type urea block copolymers will be formed along with free polyurea, especially if the equivalent ratio is greatly above or below.Of course, the amount of diisocyanate utilized along with the diamine or water can vary so that upon a stoichiometric basis as well as a kinetic basis the molecular weight of the polyurea constituent may generally range from about 1,000 to bout 40,0Q0 with the preferred range being from about 5,000 to about 25,000. Since diisocyanate compounds are very reactive, generally the urea polymers formed aro 1 craned in situ. In any event, it is important that the forma tion of the block copolymers be carried out in an environment substantially free from active hydrogens such as alcohols, acids, It and the like and thus an inert atmosphere may be used such as nitrogen, helium, argon, and the like.Of course, since water is generally an active hydrogen compound, it is thus an exception of the foregoing when it is utilized in the formation of the polyurea polymer. Should diamines be utilized as well as water, the diamines are added first in an inert atmosphere followed by the addition of water. The temperature range of the po yurca polymerization is generally from 0 C to about 260 C and preferably from about 700C to about 1800C The reaction wh n diisocyanates or polyisocyanates and diamines are utilized is rpid and does not require a catalyst. However, since the urea block copolymer formed is a heterogeneous ,mixture, the viscosity of the solution will influence the reaction rate such that a catalyst may be desired.Due often to the increase of the viscosity of the system upon polymerization, the urea block copolymer generally exists in a suspension. The urea block copolymeXr, however, may be readily coagulated and precipitated by a compound which is not a solvent for the amine terminated portion of the block copolymer, such as methanol. When water is utilized in t lC formation of the polyurea constituent, catalysts are often desirable and are well known to those skilled in the art, Generally, such catalysts are the same as used in the formation of urethane polymers set torth below and include tertiary amines. They are used in proportion to their base strength, except when steric hindrance interferes, and a suitable amount is usually from about 0.01 to about 1.0 parts per 100 parts of urea forming monomers. A preferred catalyst is triethylenediamine 1,4 diazo 2 2 2 bicyclooctane . which is more powerful than would be predicted from its base strength due probably to its reduced steric hindrance.Another class of catalysts are the metallic compounds which generally are powerful enough as the catalyst to promote a onc shot process. Of the various members of this class, the organotins are favored. Specific examples of suitable organotins include tetra n butyltin acetate, n butyltin trichloride, trimethyltin hydroxyde, dimethyltin dichloride, and tributyltin acetate. A preferred organotin is dibutyltin dilaurate. The polymeric amine constituent of the urea block copolymer may be made from any of the monomers set forth above.However, preferred monomers inclu the dienes containing from 6 tc 12 carbon atoms and preferably from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, vinyl substituted aromatics containing from 8 to 20 carbon atoms, and copolymers made therefrom. Preferred monomers of these groups include butadiene, isoprene, vinyltoluene, styrene, and 4 5 butylstyrer.e, and a copolymer madea from butadiene and styrene, that is, SBR or styrene butadiene rubber. Thus, when the amine terminated polymer constituent is 1,4 polybutadiene, polyisopropene, or the like, the urea block copolymer may be used as tire rubber or as an adhesive for bonding rubber to urethanes.Additionally, such block copolymers can be reinforced with carbon black, silica, and the like. ken the amine terminated polymer constituent is 1,2 polybutadiene the copolymer, upon cure, yields a hard plas tic however, when the amine terminated polymer constituent is a thermoplastic such as polystyrene, the resulting urea block co polymer acts as a thermoplastic. When the amine terminated poly mer constituent is rubber, the block copolymers may be cured in any conventional manner utilizing conventional cure systems of the amine terminated constituent ans generally have properties similar to a reinforced or filled amine terminated polymer.Typical uses of the urea block copolymers are numerous and the same as those generally for poiyureas or filled amine terminated polymers. Addi tionally, when the amine terminated polymer constituent is rubber, specific uses include tires, beltinq, hose and molded goods. Re gardless of the nature of the base polymer constituent, the block copolymers, as noted, also have remarkably improved processability below the melt temperature of the urea constituent. The invention will be more tully and stood by reference to the following examples. EXAMPLE XV A 500 ml resin kettle was fitted with a paddle stirrer, a nitrogen inlet, d septum, and a condenser, topped by a pressure relief bubbler. To 100 g of toluene was added a 60 g portion of 1,2 PBdNH2 Example V . The toluene w is stirred to dissolve the resin. A 0.5 g portion of aluminum stearate anhydrous was added and stirred to dissolve. Then, 69.3 ml 84.7 g 0.487 mole ofHylene Ti 80 20 2,4 2,6 toluenediisocyanate was added through the septum via a syringe. A 0.1 ml portion of dibutyltin dilaurate was added as a catalyst for urea formation. Urea formation occurred rapidly upon the addition of 50.0 ml 55.0 g 0,509 mole of molten 1000C m phenylene diamine. stirring was continued for 5 10 seconds when the entire mixture solidified. Reaction in the solid phase was permitted to continue for 72 hrs. at ambient temperatures. The material was dried in vacuum to give 205.0 g of crumbly, tannish powder which darkened upon exposure to air oxidation of excess amine . The material was sheeted out on a two roll mill. The resulting polymer was pliable and had a glossy surfac. A portion of the milled polymer was compounded on the mill according to the formulation given below.

Alternatively and less desirably, the urethane formine monomers or propolymers may be polymerized, and then reacted with the amine terminated polymer within the same temperature range. Generally, the urethane block copolymer is of the P U P type where P represents the amine terminated polymer and U represents the urethane polymer constituent.Additionally, urea forming monomers may be utilized in association with the urethane polymers or urethane forming monomers and prepolymers to produce urethane urea copolymers or block copolymers also of the P U P type structure. The urethane block copolymer, as well as the urethane urea block copolymer, generally exhibits good or improved processability at temperatures below the melt temperature of the urethane constituent or the urethane urea constituent and may be utilizing in a oreat number of applications as a thermoset upon cre. The urethane polymer constituent of the block copolymer generally contains a sicjnificant number of urethane groups to impart urethane type properties to it. Generally, the urethane constituent is prepared by reacting a polyisocyanate with any of a nuntber of conventional polyhydroxy compounds which contain at least two hydroxyl groups. Of course, the hydroxyl groups may either be end groups or located on the backbone of the compound.The polyisocyanates have the same formula as set forth above with regard to the formation of the amine terminated polymer and, thus, may be a polyisocyanate or a polyisothiocyanate, in which case, a thiourethane block copolymer is formed. As in the descrip tion of the preparation of the urea polymer r constituent, diisocyanates are preferred in order to ovoid el, and the R group is preferably an alkyl group having from 2 to 20 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group havinq from 4 to 20 carbon atoms, an aromatic having frorn 6 to 20 carbon atoms, or combinations thereof. Preferred diisocyanates for use in the preoparation of the urcthane polymer constituent or the urethane urea polymer constituent are the same dS those set forth above with reward to the discussion of the urea polymer constituent or for the preparation of the amine terminated omer. examples of polyhydroxy compounds which, of course, qenerally contain an active hydrogen, include the di and polyhydric alcohols such as the di and polyhydric phenols, the polyether polyols such as the polyether diols, the polyester diols, the polylactone diols, the phenol aldehyde novalacs, and castor oil. Compounds containing groups such as amino and carboxyl may be used. Thus, a typical urethane block copolymer may contain, in addition to tht urethane groups in the urethane constituent, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon residues, ester, ether, amide, and urea groups. Suitable di and polyhydric alcohols which may be reacted with polyisocyanates include the conventional alcohols which are commonly used in the formation of urethanes and, in general, the di and polyhydric alcohols such as the alkylene polyols having from 2 to 30 carbon atoms, the cycloalkyl polyols having from 4 to 30 carbon atoms, and thcM alkanol or cycloalkanol substituted aromatic compounds having from 8 to 30 carbon atoms.Specific examples include alpha , alpha dihydroxyxylenes, 1,3 dihydroxytetraline, and 1,4 dihydroxytetraline. Specific examples of dihydric alcohols r alkylene Jolyo incluc e primary and secondary alkyl diols s having frcm 2 to 6 carbon atoms such as ethylene glycol 1,2 propanediol, 1,3 propanediol, 1,2 butanediol 1,3butanediol 1,4 butanediol 1,5 pentanediol 1,6 hexanediol 2,3hexanediol 2,5 hexanediol and 3,4 hexanediol. Examples of a specific cycloalkyl alcohol or a cycloalkyl glycol include 1,4dimethylol cyclohexane 1,2 cyclopentanediol 1,4 cyclohexanediol or 2,2 bis 4 hydroxycyclohexane propane hydrogenated bis phenol ASpecific examples of alkylene polyols include glycerol 1,2,6hexanetriol sorbitol mannitol pentaerzthritol and 2 ethyl 2hydroxymethyl 1,3 propanediol. Generally, any of the polyether polyols such as the polyether diols which are used in the formation of urethanes may be reacted with polyisocyanates to form the urethane polymer constituent of the block copolymer. Such compounds include the polyether polyols prepared front cyclic others having from 2 to 8 carbon atoms, , preferably from 2 to 4 carbon atoms, and the polyether polyols prepared from substituted cyclic ethers having from 2 to 8 carbon atoms in the ring such as the substituted ethylene formula No. 7 and the substituted tetrahydrofurans. Th substituted R group of the above ether ring compounds is the same as set forth with regard to formula 5 and 7, except that the R group may contain up to 20 carbon atoms.That is, R may be an alkyl having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl having from 4 to 20 carbon atoms, an aromatic ring i.e., phenyl , or a substituted aromatic ririy wherein said substituted group is an alkyl having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms or a cycloalkyl group having from 4 to 20 carbon atoms. Examples of polyetht r polyols made from cyclic e zithers include compounds preferably derived from propylene oxide and or ethylene oxide, and to a much lesser extent, those derived from styrene oxide, formula No. 5, and front the above mentioned alkylene polyols.Additional examples include the polyether polyols made from the poly oxypropylene triols, the polyethers which have greater than three hydroxy groups such as those made from the polyols, of mannitol and pentaerythritol, and from the substituted oxirane ring such as 3,3 dimethoxycyclobutane, 3,3 diethyloxycyclobutane, and 3,3 methylethyloxycyclobutane. A highly preferred group of specific polyether diols are the polytetramethyleneoxide glycols which, of course, are prepare, the polymerization of tetrahydrofuran. Generally, the various polyhydroxy compounds set forth immediately above, that is, the various diols and polyols, the di and polyhydric alcohols, the various polyethor polyols such as those prepared from cyclic ethers as well as those prepared from the specifically disclose4 cyclic ethers, have an equivalent weiyht of frum about 100 to about 5,000. Preferably, the molecular weight per hydroxy group of the polyhydroxy compound will range trom about 200 to about 1,000. The polyester diols constitute yet another class of polyhydroxy compounds whi ch may be used to form the urethane polymer constituent of the block copolymer and generally any polyester which is used in the formation of urethane polymers may be utilized. Typical monomers used to prepare polyesters for the urethane polymer constituent include adipic acid or phthalic anhydride condensed with any of the alkyl diols listed above having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms.For the preparation of branched polyesters, triols such as glycerol, 1,2,6 hexanetriol, trimethylol propane, that is, 2 hydroxymethyl 2 methyl l, 3 propanediol, may be used and to a lesser extent, the various polyols such as sorbitol, mannitol and pentaerythritol. As apparent to one skillet in the art, it is desirable to use polyesters which contain only hydroxyl groups as reactive sites and, hence, polyesters which have very low acid numbers and very lo water content are preferred. The polylactone diols constitute yet another class of polyhydroxy compounds which may be used to form the urethaiie polymer constituent of the block copolymer. The lactones used in the preparation of the polylactone diols contain at least 3 carbon atoms and generally up to 15. Examples of specific lactones include caprolactone and capryllactone. The polylactone diols made from caprolactone are preferred in the present invention. Generally, the equivalent ratio of the polyisocyanate or polyisothiocyanate compounds which are reacted with the poly hydroxy compounds to form the ur cthane polymer constituent is from about 0.8 to about 1.7. A preferred equivalent ratio is from about 0.95 to about 1.05. Of course, the isocyanate will also react with the amine group of the amine terminated polymer. However, since the number ov hydroxyl end groups of the polyhydroxy compounds are large in comparison to the groups, these ratios are still valid when based upon the amount of both the hydroxyl end groups and the amine end groups. The actual equivalent ratio may very above these ranges or below them.Generally, the further away the equivalent ratio is from the desired equivalent ratio, the more P U type block copolymers are formed along with free polyurethane. On the other hand, if polyisocyanate monomers such as triisocyanates are utilized, the resulting polymeric material will be a gel or a crosslinked entity due to the additional reactive sites provided by the triisocyanate Since such entities are difficult to process, diisocyanates are preferred. f course, the weight percent of the urethane polymer constituent in the block copolymer will be largely controlled by the amount of the urethane forming monomers utilized in association with the amount of the amine terminated polymers utilized. That is, the molecular weight of the methane or the urethane urea polymer constituent can vary considerably such as from 1,000 to about 100,000. Generally, urethane block copolymers as well as block copolymers having desirable processing proper1 ties, as well as cured properties have been produced wherein the weight percent of the urethane or the urethane urea constituent is generally from 5 percent to 95 percent based upon the total weight of the block copolymer its preferably ly trom about 25 percent to about 75 percent. In order that the sits polymerization of the urethane polymer of the urethane urea copolymers, wherein diamines are utilized, do not react with compounds containing active hydrogens such as water, alcohol, acids, gel, it is generally important that such polymerization is callied out in an environment substantially free rem active hydrogens as in inert atmosphere such as nitrogen, helium, argon, and the like. However, it is to be understood that a small amount of active hydrogen compounds may be present provided that a sufficient number of urethane polymers or urethane urea polymers may be formed from the amine group of the amine terminated polymer. Catalysts are often used to promote the formation of the urethane polymer constituent of the block copolymer. The catalysts suitable for promoting the formation of urethane polymers are also generally suitable for promoting the formation of the urethane constituent in the present invention and such catalysts are well known to those skilled in the art. For example, tertiary amines which are conventional ur thane catalysts may be used and generally their catalytic strength is in proportion to their base strength except when steric hindrance interferes.An exception is triethylenediamine 1,4 diaza 2.2.2 bicyclooctane , a preferred catalyst which is much more powerful than would be predicted from its base strength due, probably i o its complete lack of steric hindrance. A large number of metallic compounds constitute anothe class of catalysts and genera b ly these catalysts are powerful 1 enough to promote one shot processes. Of the various members of this class, the organotins are favored.Specific examples of 1t suitable organotins include tetra n butyltin acetate, n butyltin trichloride, trimethyltin hydroxide, dimethyltin dichloride an tributyltin acetate. A preferred organotin is di n butyltin dilaurate. Since the polymerization temueeraturc of the urethane polymer constituent can range from about ambient to about 100 C and since the reaction of the urethane polymer or urethane forming r monomers with the amine group of the amine terminated polymer occurs easily at ambient temperatures and at a faster rate at elevated temperatures, in size polymerization of the urethane constituent is preferred.Although the reaction of the urethane can be controlled to a large extent through the selection of temperature as well as the particular polyisocyanate and the polyhydroxy compound, the choice of the catalyst can often give broader control. In fact, the catalytic effect of scope catalysts are so powerful that they often override the influences of the reactants and therefore such catalysts are used to control the reaction. One group of such catalysts, as well known to those skilled in the art, are the aforerr.entioned organotins which. con tain from 1 to 60 carbon atoms. The amine terminated polymer can be made from any of the types of monomers set forth above with regard to the preparation of said polymer and can be made in the exact same manner. Often, the resulting urethane block copolymer will be readily processa ble at temperatures blow the melt temperatures of the urethane constituent or the urethane urea constituent but will exhibit properties of the urethane constituent or the urethane urea constituent upon cure.Desirably, the amine terminated polymer is made from conjugated dienes having frum 4 to 12 carbon atoms, vinyl substituted aromatic compounds having from 8 to 20 carbon Ii atoms, and copolymers made from combinations thereof. Desirable conjugated dienes contain from 4 to 8 carbon atoms. Specifically preferred conjugated monomers i include butadiene and isoprene, whereas preferred vinyl substituted aromatic monomers include styrene, vinyltoluene, and 4 t butylstyrene.A preferred copoly mer Is made fron butadiene cind styrene monomers, that is, SBR styrene butadiene rubber The in sit polymerization of te urethane block copolymers or the urethane urea block copolymers can generally be carried out in bulk or in a solvent. Generally, the choice of urethano preparation conditions that is, in blk or in a solvent controls, to an extent, the processing properties of the block copolymer. When the polyure thane portion is pret are d in a solvents which is essentially a non solvent for polyurethane that is, non polar solvents such as hexane, heptane, or toluene , the resulting urethane block copolymers are millable at room temperature. However, when the urethane preparation is carried out in bulk or in solvents of good dissolving power for urethane, such as DMP, DMAC, the urethane block copolymers must be processed at a temperature near or above the softening point of the urethane polymer constituent. NeverI theless such block copolymers are still readily processable . Various additives, colorants, reinforcing fillers, stabilizers, and the like may be utilized as are common in the preparation of the amine terminated polymer.Thus, when utilizing a conjugated diene such as butadiene or isoprene in preparing the amine terminated polymer, conventional fillers such as carbon black , silica, oil, and the like may be utilized. Additional i, the amine terminated polymer portion of the block copolymer may be readily cured through the use of conventional curing agents.Thus, for rubber type amine terminated polymers, conventional sulfur containing compounds, organic peroxides, and the like may be utilized at convenient or conventional amounts to produce thermosets. The properties or the cured urethane block copolymers generally retain the general properties of urethane such as good abrasion resistance and flexibility. Thus, the urethane block copolymers may be used for items such as rubber goods, molded good and heavy duty industrial applications where chemical, abrasion, and corrosion resistance are desired as well as for any items wherein rubber is commonly used. When the amine polymer is a Co polymer such as styrene butadiene, the resulting urethane block copolymer may generally be used wherever reinforced cured rubbers have been utilized.

Usually, in order to form the urethane urea type block copolymers, in addition to the use of polyisocyanates and polyhydroxy compounds, diamines are used. Suitable diamine monomers have the formula H2N R NH2 wherein R is the same as set forth above with regard to the discussion of the urea block copolymer. Similarly, specific examples of diamines as well as preferred diamines are the same. Generally the urethane urea block copolymer will have uses very similar to either the urea block copolymer or the urethane block copolymer depending upon the number of urea or urethane groups within, the copolymer. In any event, the equivalent ratio of the polyhydroxy compounds plus the diamine compounds to the polyìsocyanate compounds generally ranges from about 0.8 to about 1.2 with a preferred range being from about 0.95 to about 1.05. As with the urea block copolymers or the urethane block copolymers, the urethane urea block copolymers may contain additives, conventional fillers, reinforcing fibers, stabilizers, colorants, and the like and may be cured with conventional curing agents. ,g EXAMPLE XX To a 1 liter, 3 necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, nitrogen inlet, thermometer and,a distillation head, the indicated quantities of amine terminated 1,2 polybutadiene 1,2 PBdNH2, Example V of 24,600 viscosity average molecular weight were charged as hexane cement.The indicated quantities of hydrocarbon solvent were added and the mixture heated to distill, off the hexane and any water.

Due to the ease of preparation, an in situ formation is highly desired. The imide polymer constituent of the block copolymer is produced by the chemical reaction of an alkyl dianhydride, preferably an aromatic dianhydride, or combinations thereof, with an alkyl diamine, a cycloalkyl diamine, or preferably an aromatic diamine. When the formation is in situ with the amine terminated polymer, the anhydride will readily react with the amine group of the amine terminated polymer. The alkyl dianhydrides generally contain from 8 to about 30 carbon atoms with the aromatic dianhydrides containing from 10 to about 40 carbon atoms. Naturally, the aromatic dianhydrides may contain substituted alkyl groups such as those connecting aromatic nuclei, or existing as on alkyl side chains, or combinations thereof wherein the total number of carbon atoms in the compound is from 11 to 40 carbon atoms.The alkyl diam.nes contain from 2 to 20 carbon atoms, the cycloalkyl diamines contain from 4to 20 carbon atoms, and the aromatic diamines contain from 6 to about 20 carbon atoms. Similarly, the aromatic diamines may contain alkyl groups which connect the aromatic nuclei, exist as alkyl side chains, or combinations thereof, wherein the total number of carbon atoms of the substituted aromatic diamine is from 7 to 20 carbon atoms.Examples of aromatic dianhydrides include pyromellitic dianhydride, 2,3,6,7 naphthalene tetracarboxylic dianhydride 3,3 , 4,4 diphenyl tetracarboxylic dianhydride 1,2,5,6 naphthalene tetracarboxylic dianhydride 2,2 ,3,3 diphenyl tetracarboxylic dianhydride 2,2 bis 3, 4 dicarboxyphenyl propane dianhydride 2,2 bis 3.4 dicar boxyphenyl sulfone dianhydride 3,4,9,10 perylene tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride bis 3, 4 dicarboxyphenyl ether dianhydridst 3,3 ,4,4 benzophenone tetracarboxylic dianhydride ethyleneglycol bistrimellitate dianhydride and a dianhydride having the following formulaEMI120.1 wherein R3 and R4 can be hydrogen, an alkyl having from 1 to about 12 carbon atoms, and an aromatic or an alkyl substituted aromatic having from 6 to 20 carbon atoms. Preferably, R3 and R4 are iden tical. R5 is an alkyl having from 2 to about 12 carbon atoms or a cycloalkyl having from 4 to 15 carbon atoms.Preferably, R5 is an aromatic or alkyl substituted aromatic containing from 6 to 20 carbon atoms or an aromatic having the formula EMI121.1 I where X O, S02, S, an alkyl having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, C, and SO. Highly preferred dianhydrides include pyromellitic dianhydride and benzophenone tetracarboxylic dianhydride. Examples of preferred diamines include alkylenediamines having from 2 through 8 carbon atoms such as hexamethylenediamine m phenylenediamine p phenylenediamine toluenediamine and diamines having the formula EMI121.2 where R6 is one of the diva lent radicals selected from the group consisting of C1 through C3 alkylene EMI121.3 Preferred diamines include bis 4 aminophenyl ether, bis 4 amino phenyl sulfide, meta phenylenediamine, methylene dianiline, and para phenylenediamine. The amount of dianhydride and diamines utilized can vary depending upon the generally desired molecular weight of the imide polymer constituent although as understood by those skilled in the art, the molecular weight will also be dependent upon the reaction temperature as well as various kinetic ramifiDesirably, the equivalent ratio of the diamine to the di hydride ranges from about 1.10 to about 0.80 with a preferred equivalent ratio being 1.05 to about 0.90 Should only small amounts of the imide forming monomers be added, some of the amine terminated polymers will not form a block copolymer in that there is not a sufficient amount of the monomers present.Desirably, an amount of the imide forming monomers is added so that at leas 5 percent and preferably at least 25 percent of the amine terminated polymers are reacted to form imide block copolymers. The reaction of or the amine group of the amine terminated polymer with a dian ,hydride occurs quite readily and, generally the efficiency or the 11reaction with the dianhydrides is very high and often can, for I example, be 100 percent. The weight of the imide polymer consti tuent may generally vary from about 10 percent to about 75 percent by weight with 25 percent to 75 percent being preferred and 50 per cent to about 75 percent being highly preferred, based upon the total weight of the block copolymer.Additionally, an amount of imide forming monomers is generally used so that a desirable molecular weight of the imide constituent is usually between 5,0001 and 35,000 and preferably between 10,000 and 35,000. Of course, higher or lower molecular weights may often be desirable. As before with the other various block copolymers, it is desirable that the in situ reaction as well as any reaction of an amine terminated polymer with an imide polymer containing an unreacted anhydride group thereon, be carried out in an environ ment substantially free from active hydrogens such as water, alcohol, acids, or the like. Therefore, inert gases or atmospheres such as nitrogen, argon, or helium may be utilized. It is to be, understood that a very small amount of active hydrogen may be sent provided that a sufficient number of amine terminated pc avers are reacted to produce the imide block copolymer having desiable properties.In the preparation of the imide block copolymer, the amine monomer is usually added to the amine terminated polymer.Then, the dianhydride monomer is generally added in an amount which is slightly in excess of that of the diamine. Reaction with both the amine group of the amine terminated polymer and the polymerization of the imide forming monomers readily occurs at room temperature although heat may be applied to increase the reaction rate. Generally, both reactions occur in a temperature range of from about 0 C t9 about 200 C. Hence, catalysts are usually not required. it As previously noted, the amine terminated polymer may be prepared in a solvent. An imide solvent such as dimethyl formamide, dimethyl acetamide or dimethyl sulfoxide is added to the reaction vessel before any in situ polymerization occurs and the solvent of the amine terminated polymer removed by distillation.Then, the diamine is added followed by a preferred excess of dianhydride with a fairly rapid exothermic reaction occurring.Since the formation of the imide polymer constituent is extremely moisture sensitive, it is very important that substantially all traces of moisture such as that contained in any of the solvents be removed from the reaction vessel so that polymerization is not retarded. The formation of the imide polymer constituent involves 1 ring closing reaction whereby water is the by product. Since it is difficult to distill the water from the imide constituent in t reaction vessel, desirably, an azeotropic forming solvent such as toluee or benzene is added to the reaction vessel. The byproduct water is then removed by heating the vessel and condensing the water andaromatic solvent vapors. A Dean Stark type trap may be utilized to separate the condensed vapors.Since the water is heavier than the aromatic solvent it will accumulate in the bottom of the trap with the solvent overflowing from the upper portion back into the reaction vessel. Naturally, the reflux temperature of the vessel is determined by the type of azeotropic solvent utilized. The reaction is continued generally until completion, with the block copolymer formed existing in a nonaqueous suspension which can be readily separated as by drum drying or by precipitation with any non solvent with respect to the amine terminated portion of the block copolymer. The imide block copolymer may be cured in any convention manner with the exception of a block copolymer wherein the polymer of the amine terminated portion tends to, degrade updn curing such as the polymers made from the various vinyl aromatic monomers. Thus, conventional sulfur compounds, organic peroxide compounds, and the like may be utilized.It has been found that improved physical properties of cured imide block copolymers may be obtained, especially when the polymer of the amine terminated polymer portion has a high vinyl content, when a particular class of organic peroxides having the formula 0H3 R 2 OC R 2CH3 is used wherein R represents an alkyl having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl having from 4 to 20 carbon atoms, an aromatic, or combinations thereof, containing from 6 to 20 carbon atoms.Examples of typical R groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, b vl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, decyl, dodecyl, octadecyl, phenyl, tol. 1, xylyl, benzyl, phenethyl, naphthyl, methylnaphthyl, naphthylethyl, I diphenyl, benzylphenyl, butylphenyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclohexylmethyl, cycloheptylethyl, methylcycloheptyl, and the like. The organic peroxides of the above formula may be diperoxides or mixed peroxides, that is, peroxides which have two different CH3C R 204 radicals. Specific examples include dicumyl peroxide, a preferred peroxide, ditertiarybutyl peroxide, tertiarybutyl cumyl peroxide, di tertiaryamyl peroxide, tertiarybutyl tertiaryamyl peroxide, tertiaryamyl cumyl peroxide, ditertiaryocty l. peroxide, bis l,l diphenyl ethyl peroxide, bis 1,1dicyclohexyl ethyl peroxide, bis 1 cycloehxyl 1 methyl ethyl peroxide, also known as bis 2 cyclohexyl 2 propyl peroxide, bis 1 phenyl l ethyl ethyl peroxide, also known as bis 2 2 phenylbutyl peroxide 1, and the like.The symmetrical peroxides which have I identical groups on each side of the peroxy oxygens are generally more available and therefore are preferred. However, mixed peroxides, when available, can be used very satisfactorily. Whether mixed peroxides or diperoxides of the above t class are used to impart to the block copolymers improved proper i ties which are generally more favorable than if ordinary peroxide other than the above class were used, the peroxides used axe advantageously those having a reasonably fast rate of decomposition at the temperature employed. The various imide block copolymers possess properties generally exhibited by conventional imide polymers in that they are usually very strong and very light. Due to the preparation, they are generally void free. Furthermore, the molecular weight reduction,due to cleavage or degradation upon heating to 6000C, is usually much lower for the imide block copolymers of the preset invention when compared to the weight reduction of conventional 1 imide polymers. Another advantage is that the imide block Co polymers can be processed by cold milling and molding at low temperatures such as about 1500C when compared to temperatures of approximately 600 C required by conventional imide polymers.Yet another advantage is that the imide block copolymers possess a greater plasticity that is more process able than comparable block copolymers made from a rubber isocyanate terminated base polymer process. The high plasticity allows many of the imide block copolymers to be compounded with silica, for example, 100 parts of silica per 100 parts of rubber amine terminated polyimide co copolymer which gave improved flexural and impact properties when compared to the unfilled samples . The Imide block copolymers of the present invention can be utilized in applications wherever conventional imide polymers are utilized such as valve seals, retaining rings, compressor vanes, piston and bearing retaining rings, electrical relay activators, hose and tubing, and various electrical equipment where a high temperature is required such as wire and cable wraps, coil wrap, and the like. Moreover, due to their ease of processability, the imide block copolymers can also be utilized as solids such as in molds and as coatings. Although the polymer of the amine terminated polymer constituent may be made from any of the monomers set forth above, generally, rubber type polymers are preferred. That is, preferred monomers include the conjugated dienes having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms and preferably from 4 to 8 carbon atoms may be utilized.Additionally, vinyl substituted aromatic monomers having from 8 to 20 carbon atoms are desired. Copolymers of these two types of monomers are also desired. Highly preferred monomers include butadiene, isoprene, vinyltoluene, styrene, 4 t butystyrene and a copolymer of butadiene and styrene, that is SBR styrene butadiene rubber . As with the other block copolymers, whenever a high vinyl rubber polymer is utilized such as 1,2 polybutadiene, the resulting block copolymer will not be as flexible nor have the impact strength as a low vinyl polymer such as 1,4 polybutadiene. The invention will be better understood by the following examples. EXAMPLE XXII To a clean, dry, nitrogen purged beverage bottle was adde 50 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran THF , 72.0 g of butadiene and after cooling to 250C in a CC14 dry ice bath, 4.70 ml of 1.57 M n butyl lithium 7.2 m mol in hexane. After 4 hrs., a sample was taken and was shown by NMR to be 90 percent 1,2 polybutadiene with a 17,000 molecular weight by GPC. To this solution was added 14.0 ml of 1.034 M TDI 14.5 m mol in toluene. Sampling after 5 min. showed 25 percent coupling by GPC.Immediately after sampling, 5 ml of molten dry caprolactam 44.2 m mol was then added, followed by 1.0 ml of distilled water 55.5 m mol . A portion of this mixture was coagulated in methanol, dried and was titrated to give 0.118 milliequivalents of amine per gram. The reaction mixture was transferred to a 2 liter resin kettle containing 500 ml of dry dimethyl acetamide DMAc .After the TIlE was removed by distillation, 200 ml of dry toluene and 16.71 g 0.155 moles of m phenylene diene was added. To this solution at 1000C was added 49.77 g 0.155 moles of benzophenone tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride BTDA . A Dean Stark trap was installed and the temperature was raised such that smoot boiling occurred 130 1350C . Overnight, a total of 12.9cc of toluene insolubles were collected in the trap. Analysis by gas chromatography shows this to be mainly water with some DMAC present. The clear solution during this time became a fine non aqueous suspension in the DMAC toluene mixture. Coagulation in excess methanol followed by methanol washing, filtering, and vacuum drying, gave 115 g of copolymer.Milling on a cold mill was used to introduce the fillers and curatives. Samples were cured for 20 mins. at 1770C. Additional copolymers with variations in polybutadiene vinyl content, molecular weight and content were prepared by the general procedure of Example XXII. The pertinent data on copolymer composition, compounding, and physical properties is tabulated below.
