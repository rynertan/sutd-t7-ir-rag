# MEASURING EXTRAVASCULAR LUNG WATER WITH A THERMAL INDICATOR AND A NON THERMAL INDICATOR

## Abstract
A catheter 16 is provided for injecting a thermal indicator into the bloodstream of a subject at a position proximal to or in the right hear 10 . A thermistor 28 is provided for detecting a time thermal indicator con centration curve of the bloodstream at a position in a systemic artery and a computer component 108 respon sive to this time thermal indicator concentration curve is provided for calculating a first characteristic time for the time thermal indicator concentration curve. An op tical device 120 is provided for detecting a time non thermal indicator concentration curve of the bloodstream at a position in the systemic artery and a computer component 126 responsive to this time non thermal indicator concentration curve is provided for calculating a second characteristic time for the time non thermal indicator concentration curve. Computer components 112 and 114 are provided for calculating the flow of blood through the heart and lungs. Computer compo nents 128 and 130 are provided for calculating a meas ure of extravascular lung water in accordance with the difference between the product of the blood flow and the first characteristic time and the product of the blood flow and the second characteristic time.
