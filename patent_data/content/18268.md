# Ultrasonographic elements containing multiple layers and process for preparing images.

## Abstract
Ultrasonographic elements are disclosed which are comprised of first and second layers coated on a support, at least one of the layers being a silver halide emulsion layer. One of the layers contains a diffusible ion capable of altering the sensitivity of a silver halide emulsion while the other layer is capable of immobilizing the diffusible ion. Interposed between the layers is a barrier layer for impeding diffusion of the sensitivity altering ion in the absence of ultrasound. An ultrasonographic image is formed by ultrasonically exposing the element image wise to accellerate diffusion of the sensitivity altering ion between the layers while the element is in contact with a transport liquid, exposing the element to electromagnetic radiation and photographically processing the element to produce an image corresponding to the image pattern of ultrasonic exposure.
