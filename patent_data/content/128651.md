An example of a fermentation profile in a 200 gal 757 liter fermentor is shown in the following table.

Isolation of CL 1565 AExample C The harvested beer from the above fermentation is mixed with 34 kg of Celite 545 and filtered through a plate and frame filter press. The filtrate 473 liters is percolated through a 30.5 cm O.D. column containing 120 liters of HP 20 resin Gillies International, Inc., La Jolly, California . The resin is then washed with water 635 liters , and 90 10 water methanol 170 liters . Most of the CL 1565 A is tnen eluted from the resin with 80 20 water methanol.High pressure liquid chromatographic analyses HPLC , performed in the manner described below, of the ensuing eluates typically show the following elution profile. 80 20 water methanol eluate grams of CL 1565 A µ1 340 liters 2 g 2 34O liters 11.5 g 3 340 liters . 7.0 g Eluates 2 and t3 are separately concentrated and lyophilized to afford 90.2 g and 78.7 g, respectively, of dark brown solids. These products are combined and dissolved in 3 liters of water. The e resulting solution is added to 27 liters of methanol with stirring. After standing overnight at 50C, the mixture is filtered and the precipitate is washed with 5 liters of methanol.The filtrate and wash are combined, concentrated in vacuo, and lyophilized to yield 104.5 g of a solid. A portion of this product 95 grams in 1.5 liters of water is added slowly with mixing to 17 liters of 1 propanol. After one hour the resulting mixture is filtered and the precipitate is washed with 2 liters of l propanol. The filtrate and wash are combined, concentrated, and lyophilized to afford 57 g of a solid which, by HPLC analysis, typically contains about 15 g of CL 1565 A. This product is chromatographed, in approximately 15 g lots, on 1.2 liters of 40 iim C18 silica gel Analytichem International, Inc., Harbor City,California contained in a 7.6 cm tO.D. column. The eluent is 0.005 M pH 4.5 ammonium acetate buffer followed by 0.005 M pH 4.5 ammonium acetate containing 5 acetonitrile. The fractions collected are assayed by HPLC. The e fractions containing CL 1565 A are pooled, concentrated, and lyophilized.A portion 570 mg of the resulting product is rechromatographed using a Prep LC System 500 apparatus fitted with a Prep Pak 500 C18 column Waters Instruments, Inc.,Milfcrd, Massachusetts and 0.1 M pH 6.5 phosphate buffer containing 10 acetonitrile as the eluent. The major fractions, containing approximately 375 mq of CL 1565 A, are pooled and concentrated n vacuo. The aqueous solution is passed through a column containing 200 ml of HP 20 resin packed in water. The resin is then washed with 1400 ml of water and CL 1565 A 5 remaining on the column is eluted with 350 ml of 50 methanol. The eluate is concentrated in vacuo and passed through a column containing 35 ml of Dowex 50X2 Na .The effluent pH 5.5 and a water wash of the resin are combined and lyophilized to yield 180 mg of purified CL 1565 A, isolated as a sodium salt. Analysis cf this product shows typically that the product contairs approximately 1.3 moles of sodium per 1.0 mole of parent CL 1565 A free acid. Because the free acids CL 1565 A, CL 1565 B, and CL 1565 T are labile, they preferably are isolated in the salt form such as the sodium salt form, preferably as the salts having about 1.0 to about 2.0 moles of sodium per 1.0 mole of free acid.Example D Filtered beer 719 liters , prepared in the same manner as described above, are passed over 31 liters of Dowex l x 2 chloride form packed in a 30.5 cm Eo .D. column. The effluent and the subsequent water wash usually do not contain any detectable amounts of the CL 1565 components. The entire fractionation described herein is monitored by the HPLC method described below using 0.1M pH 6.8 phosphate buffer Na acetonitrile 88 12 as the solvent system. The Dr,wex l resin is then eluted with 1M sodium chloride methanol l i and the eluate is coilected in two 10 liter and six 15 liter fractions. The CL 1565 A, CL 1565 B,CL 1565T appear in eluates two through six.These fractions are combined and diluted with 246 liters of acetone. The resulting mixture is stored at 5 C overnight. The clear supernatant solution is removed and concentrated to 16 liters in vacuo. Lyophilization of this concentrate affords about 800 q of a solid. This product 740 g is added to about 550 g of a similar product isolated in the same manner and the combined solids are dissolved in 20 liters of water. The resulting solution pH 6.0 is chromatographed on 50 liters of HP 20 resin contained in a 15 cm O.D. column.Elution of the HP 20 column with 175 liters of water removes most of the CL 1565T. Most of the CL 1565 A component is eluted with 100 liters of methanol water 15 85 CL 1565 B and the remaining amount of CL 1565 A are eluted with 83 liters of methanol water 50 50 . The eluates richest in CL 1565 A are combined, concentrated, and lyophilized to afford a solid which, b HPLC analysis, c3ntains about 110 g of CL 1565 A. A 75 gram portion of this product is dissolved in two liters of 0.05 M pH 6.8 phosphate buffer and further purified by chromatography on 52 liters 25 kg of 100 pm C18 reverse phase silica gel Analytichem International, Inc., Harbor City,California packed in 0.05 M pH Ï.8 phosphate buffer Na in a 15 cm tO.D.1 column. The column is developed with 0.05M phosphate buffer containing increasing amounts 4.0 6.5 of acetonitrile. The early fractions contain CL 1565T. CL 1565 A is eluted in subsequent fractions. The fractions containing CL 1565 A as the only UV absorbing component are pooled and concentrated in vacuo to 20 liters. This concentrate is stored overniqht at SOC and the inorganic salt that precipitates is filtered off. The filtrate is then charged on a 15 cm O. D.l column containing 28 liters of HP 20 resign. The resin is washed with water 66 liters , and CL 1565 A is then eluted with 42 liters of methanol water 50 50 .The eluates that contain the majority of the CL 1565 A are combined 26 liters , concentrated, and lyophilized to yield CL 1565 A containing some inorganic impurities. The inorganic impurities can be removed by dissolving the product in methanol at 50 to 100 mg ml , filtering off any insoluble material, and converting the filtrate to an aqueous solution by continually adding water to the filtrate as it is being concentrated in vacuo. Final purification of CL 1565 A is effected by chromatography of the resulting aqueous concentrate on HP 20 resin.Properties of CL 1565 A, Sodium SaltUltraviolet Absorption Spectrum in MeOH max 268 nm al 805 with inflections at 259 and 278 nmInfrared Absorption Spectrum in KBr Principal absorptions at 3400, 1710, 1630, 1423, 1387, 1260, 1155, 1090, 1060, 975, 920, 820, and 775 reciprocal centimeters.

In this case, at a flowrate of 2 ml min, the retention times of CL 1S6S, CL 1565 A, and CL 1565 B are approximately 2.7, 5.C, and 12 minutes, respectively. CL 1565 T is eluted earlier than CL 1565 A from HP 20 resin and from reverse phase silica gel.It can be isolated from the early fractions of theC18 silica gel column described in example D, above, using HP 20 resin.CL 1565 B is eluted more slowly than CL 1565 A from HP 20 resin and from reverse phase silica gel.CL 1565 B is eluted with 50 methanol during theHP 20 chromatography of the crude Dowex l product described in example D, above.

The Dowex l resin was then eluted with 1M sodium chloride methanol 1 1 and the eluate was collected in two 10 liter and six 15 liter fractions. Most of the CL 1565 A, CL 1565 B,, CL 1565 T, and additional minor CL 1565 components appeared in eluates two through six. These fractions were combined and diluted with 246 liters of acetone.The resulting mixture was stored at 50C overnight.The clear supernatant solution was removed and concentrated to 16 liters in vacuo.

The compounds are active, for example, against P388 lymphatic leukemia in vivo or either L1210 mouse leukemia cells or human colon adenocarcinoma cells in vitro.Therefore, use of the compounds of the invention is contemplated for their antvtumor activity as an active component of pharmaceutical compositions. When being utilized as cytotoxic or antileukemic agents, the compounds of the invention can be prepared and administered in various dosage forms, especially parenteral dosage forms. It will be clear to those skilled in the art that the dosage forms may comprise as the active component, one or more compounds of the invention. The compounds are administered parenterally or intraperitoneally. Solutions of te active compound as either a salt or nonsalt form whichever is appropriate, can be prepared in an aqueous vehicle, optionally with a solubilizing agent or surfactant such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in osis. under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases the form must be sterile and rust be fluid to the extent that easy syringeability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and torage and must be preserved againt the contamina tion action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like ,N,N dimethyl acetamide, suitable mixtures thereof and vegetable oils.The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants.The prevention of the action or microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by sterilization accomplished by filtering.Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredient into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of the sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred metnods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying technique which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile filtered solution therof. A3 used herein, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like.The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supple menta active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosage for the mammalian subjects to be treated each unit containing a pree termined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier.The specification for the novel unit dosage forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on a the unique characteristics of the active material and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and tb the limitation inherent in the art of compound such an active material for the treatment of disease in living subjects having a diseased codition in which bodily health is impaired as herein disclosed in detail. The principal active ingredient is compounded for convenient and effective administration in effective amounts with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in unit dosage form as hereinbefore disclosed. A unit dosage form can, for example, con tain the principal active compound in amounts ranging from abut 10 wg to about 500 mg, wit from about 25 rng to about 200 mg being preferred. Expressed in proportions, the active compound is generally present in from about 10 to about 500 mg ml of carrier. In the case of compositions containing supplementary active ingredients, the dosages are determined by reference to the usual dose and the manner of administration of the said ingredients.The daily parenteral doses for mammalian subjects to be treated ranges from 0.01 mg kg to 10 mg kg. The preferred daily dosage range is 0.1 mg kg to 1.0 mg kg. In therapeutic use as cytotoxic or anti tumour agents the compounds are administered at the initial dosage of about 0.01 mg to about 10 mg per kilogram. A dose range of about 0.1 mg to about 1.0 mg per kilogram is preferred. The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated, and the compound being employed. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound.Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments untii the optimum effect under toe circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in porticns during the day if desired. The compounds of the invention are also useful as intermediates or substrates for the chemical or biochemical synthesis or in sit delivery of pharmacologically active compounds. The formula of the compound CL 1565 PT 3 is not yet known, but the characteristics of the sodium salt are clearly indicated hereinbefore.The microorganism ATCC 33906 was deposited on the 3rd June 1981.
