## Description
A method of manufacturing a macromolecular material conducting current on its surfaceThe invention concerns a method of manufacturing a macromolecular material conducting current on its surface by the surface introduction of conducting complexes.The knovfn methods of modifying the surface of macromolecular materials so tat their surface should conduct electric current comprise the introduction of conduction materials on the surface of macromolecular materials, the inductIon of chemical reactions between conducting substances and 2 macromolecular material, and coating the surfaces of objects made of mscromole cular materials fth conducting lacquers.The above methods have been described for example in the book by R.H. Norman Conductive Rubbers and Plastics , Appl. Sci. Ltd., London, 1970 and by Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology11 under entries Antistatic Agents and Polymers, Conductive .For tile purpose of Imparting screening properties and of earthing polymeric coats and objects where higher surface conductances are required, use is made of coating surfaces with a metal or metal compound layer by vacuum evaporation cathode sputtering, plating or flange sputtering, which requires complicated multi stage processes DE OS 3,112,104 , or coating surfaces with conducting lacquers containing aitureo of metallic and graphite powders, or black Jap. Kokai Kckkyo Tokkyo Koho J.P. 7b,102,930 . This requires, however, the use of considerable amounts of expensive noble metals, if the coat is to retain good properties and not to undergo surface oxidation.Besides, coating a plastic material with a metal layer can unfavourably affect its useful properties. The above methods have been described for example by Jep. Kosiarski Polym. Plast. Techno Eng. 13,183,1979 For the purpose of imparting anti static properties to materials made from polymers, the so called anti static agents are used, among them being organic ionic salts deposited to surface in the form of a film from solution or in the form of an aerosol, or appropriate macromolecular compounds, such as for example in situ cross linked polyelectrolytes US PS 3,021,332 or GB PS 991,485 .Anti etatic agents, most frequently cationic surface active agents can also be introduced into the bulk of a macromolecular material then, by gradually diffusing to the surface, they could form on it a layer capable to transport electric charges Cztenao SN,Antistatic Agent Products Bulletin, American Cyanamid Cho. , The above methods are,.however1 unreliable, antistatic properties depending on environmental humidity and, additionally, the thin layer being easily abraded or. washed away.The methods involving chemically binding the antiata tic agent to the base, such as surface sulphonation or subjection to the action of low temperature plasma give more stable coats which, however, require complicated manufacturing methods these methods have been described for example by D.A. Seanor Polym, Plast. Techn. Eng. 3,69,1974 .The abcve described anti static agents do not allow one to obtain layers having a strictly definite and constant resistance and capable of being used in electrotechnics and electronics as, for example, resistance components.Also knovn are the methods of obtaining current conducting macromolecular materials by adding to polymers the admixtures that form complexes with transfer of charges, or Lewis acids, These methods have been described in a review by J. Ulanski, J.K. Jeszka and M. Eryazoviski in Polym, Plant. Technol. Eng.17,139 1981 . For example, a method is know, whereby a macromolecular material conducting electric current in the bulk is obtained by crystallising small of the order of 1 amounts of conducting complexes with charge transfer during the process of obtaining film from solution Patent Specification No. 116,850 . The materials obtained by that method show, however, volume conductance, which is not always desirable and, besides, require large amounts of admixtures.The phenomenon of the formation and crystallisation of complexes with charge transfer during the process of pouring polymeric films from solution or, after saturating the polymeric base with a solution of the complex with charge transfer. methods are also known of obtaining dielectric mater ials of high dielectric constants Jpn. Kokal Tokkyo Koho J,P.57,121,055 3.P. 79,11947 JOP. 79,12500 Jpn. Kokai 78, 6 3242 . In these materials, however, use is made of high con tents of admixtures, and the conductance of these materials is low. Also known are the methods of obtaining current con ducting macromolecular materials that consist of polymeric and molecular bases and. substances disper wed in them and capable of charge transfer completes or the so called Lexis acids, for example iodine, Asp 5, and alkaline metals. These admixtures are in trounced by pouring films from a common solution of the polymer and admixture by polymerising one of the components of the complex, and soaking the polymer with a solution of the admixture or the vapour of the admixture, in the electrochemical way, etc. DE OS 3,105,449 Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo Koho 79, 18853 Jpn. wokai 77106496, 7713594, 7711740, 7825700 . The above materials show a high conductance, but with very high admixture contents. Besides, the admixtures used show a low resistance to the action of weather ing agents such as oxygen or water and to that of light and, also, frequently shove a tendency to diffuse out of the polymeric base.In addition to the above, these methods can be used for imparting conducting properties to certain types of polymers only, i. e. those capable of forming charge transfer complexes or, also, require the polymer to be specially pretreated, as for example dehydration.The method of obtaining a macromolecular material that conducts electric current on its surface by way of introducing conducting complexes as per the invention involves subjecting the surface of a non conducting polymeric material containing an addition of an electron donor and or an electron acceptor in an amount of 0.2 5 by weight to the action of an organic solvent, a mixture of organic solvents or their vapours, pos sibly containing an addition of an electron acceptor or donor in an amount of 0.1 4 by weight. Compounds having a small molecular mass and capable of forming highly conducting charge transfer complexes are used in electron donors and acceptors in the method according to the invention.According to the invention, tetrathiotetracene, tetrathiofulvalene, tetraselenofulvalene and their derivatives are preferably used as electron donors, whereas tetra cyanoquinomethane, tetracyanonaphthoquinone and their derivatives are preferably used as electron acceptors. The non conducting polymeric material used in the method as per the invention and consisting of a polymer and an addition of a donor and or an acceptor dissolved in the former can be obtained in any way and occur in the form of a film and can also be applied as a layer onto various objects or subjected to another treatment by, for example, moulding or extrading and obtained in the form of object of require ed shape.The above material is next subjected to the action of an organic solvent, a mixture of organic solvents, possibly containing an addition of a donor or an acceptor or their vapours by, for example, dampening, wetting, sprinkling, vapour blowing, etc.The penetration of the surface layer of the polymeric material by the solution or vapour of the solvent causes a conducting complex to be formed and crystal lised in that layer in the form of a conducting lattice and, besides, the surface crystallisatlon of a polymeric layer, which favourably affects the forma tion and distribution of crystallites. By the method as per the invention, the polymeric material subjected to the action of a solution may contain an addition of only one component of the complex, i.e. either a donor or acceptor. Tn that case, the second component of the complex is supplied to the surface of the polymeric material together vsith the organic solvent used.The kinds of the organic solvents used by the method according to the invention do not play an essential role, since they are removed during the drying of the sur face 5 ediately after being used, the solvents being selected aecenainb on the polymeric material used.For the purpose of improving the properties of the conducting layer, e.g. mechanical strength, the orga nic solvent can also contain some amounts of a polymer, the latter forming the base or another polymer.The macromolecular material conducting electric current on its surface and obtained by the method according to the invention is characterised by a low surface resistivity of the order of 102 1010cm, the latter being regu lated by the concentration of the electron donor and or acceptor and process conditions. Besides, it shoves a weak dependence of conductance on temperature over a wide temperature variation range. Apart from that, the charge transfer complex occuring in the polymer base in the crystalline form shows a high resistance to the action of weathering agents and light and does not show any tendency to diffuse from the polymer. The thickness of the current conducting surface layer of the polymeric material obtained by the method as per the invention can vary and in some instances, very thin films for example, can extend across the entire bulk of the film and, consequently, bulk conducting films can be obtained. Thanks to various concentrations and combinations of donors and or acceptors, various organic solvents and their mixtures and vapours having been used on the various parts and sides of the surfaces of the polymeric material being treated also for example on various surfaces of an object , the method according to the invention enables a surface to be obtained, characterised by different electric properties, i.e.showing different conductances at different parts, different resistance varying at a gradient along the surface and different anisotropic conductance.The macromolecular material conducting electric current on its surface and obtained by the method as per the invention is suited for wide application. It can be used for removing electric charges, screening electromagnetic radiation, obtaining conductance or resistance paths,ana also one side conducting films for use in capacitors, sun batteries, electrochemical cells and sem conductor components.The examples provided below illustrate in more detail the method as per the invention without restricting its range.Example I 100 parts by weight of 2 polycarbonate have been dissolved in 2500 parts by weight of chlorobenzene at a temperature of 370 X, whereafter 1 part by weight of tetrathiofulvalene and 1 part by weight of tetra cyanoquinodimethane were added and also dissolved at the same temperature. The solution thus prepared was poured onto a glass plate at a temperature of 360 K.A 20 m thick film of uniform yellow colouring and not conducting electric current has been thus obtained.The material thus initially obtained was then placed in the saturated ethylene chloride vapour at a temperature of 300 K for 1 min. As a result, the film changed its colouring to greyish and. crystallites of the charge transfer complex appeared in its surface layer, that were visible under the microscope. The surface resistivity of the material thus obtained amounts to 104 cm at room temperature.Example II 100 parts by weight of a polycarbonate have been dissolved in 4000 parts by weight of chlorobenzene and, then, 2 parts by weight of tetracyanquinodimethane were added and also dissolved at that temperature. The solution thus prepared as poured onto a polJFes ter film at n temperature of 370 K.After the solvent had been evaporated, a 10 jun thick layer Or uniform yellow colouring, not conducting electric current and ell adherring to the polyester, v as formed. The surface of the material thus initially obtained was then wetted with a 0.2 by weight tetrathiofl valene solution in a chlorobenzene n heptane mixture at a ratio of 1 3 and dried after 5 minutes with hot air. As a result of that the surface layer of the material changed its colouring to greyish and cryetallites of the conducting complex visible under the microscope appeared in it. The surface resistivity of the material thus obtained is 3x104 cm at room temperature.Example III 100 parts by weight of polymethyl methacrylate have been dissolved in 2500 parts by weight of ortho dichlorobenzene at a temperature of 400 K, whereafter 1 part by weight of tetrathiofulvalene and 1 part by weight of tetracyanquinodimethane were added and also dissolved at that temperature. The solution thus obtained was poured onto a glass plate at a temperature of 390 K.A 30 pm thick film of uniform yellow colouring and not conducting electric current has been obtained. One side of the film thus initially obtained has been subjected to the action of the saturated vapour of ethylene chloride at a temperature of 300 K for a time of 0.5 min and dried in a jet of warm air. As a result, the surface of the film showed a surface resistance of 105 cm at room temperature. Next, the other side of the film was subjected to the action of the saturated vapour of ethyl methyl ketone for a time of 1 min. at a temperature of 300 K and dried in a jet of warm air. AsHa result, that surface of the film showed a surfa ce resistance of 4 x 1o2 cm at room temperature, practically constant 2 at 330 K and increasing by about 120 ffi with a drop in temperature down to 80 K.
