# Railway control signal dynamic input interlocking systems.

## Abstract
The specification discloses an electronic or computer based railway control signal interlocking system. Signals representing the settings or conditions of railway control elements e.g. track circuits, signals and points, and their control signals are checked as usual by the interlock equip ment to establish route safety. However failures in the system may only be discovered when a change to a control element setting is attempted. Since long periods can elapse between changes a failure may lie dormant for some time. In order to reduce dormant wrong side failure periods to a minimum the signals supplied to the interlocking means are periodically smitched to a predetermined state chosen to prove that when the interlocking means receives the switched signal that a wrong side failure mode does not exist in the switched signal path.
