# Engine valve train system.

## Abstract
An engine valve train system for selectively effecting operation of a pair of side by side valves 11, 11a of a cylinder and to effect deactivation of one 11a of the valves in the pair during predetermined modes of engine operation includes first and second rocker arms 30, 40 pivotably supported on a hollow rocker shaft 20 which in turn is suitably supported for pivotable movement between an operative position and an idle or inoperative position and which is connected to a source of pressurized hydraulic fluid. The first rocker arm 30 is adapted to be driven by an actuator 18 to effect opening and closing movement of one 11 of the valves. The second rocker arm 40 has a hydraulic cylinder 50 and piston 55 means which, when the rocker shaft is in the operative position, is supplied with hydraulic fluid whereby to extend the piston 55 to operatively connect the second rocker arm with the first rocker arm so as to be also operated thereby whereby to effect opening and closing movement of the other one 11a of the valves and when the rocker shaft is in the idle or inoperative position, hydraulic fluid can drain from the hydraulic cylinder and piston means whereby the second rocker arm becomes inoperative to effect opening movement of the other one of the valves.
