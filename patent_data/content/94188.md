# BORE GAUGE

## Abstract
An internal bore gauge comprises a body portion 12 having radial slots 20 carrying a pair of diametrically opposed anvils 22 capable of controlled movement in the radial direction, the anvils 22 having rounded end faces 36 of radius of curvature close to the radius of the bore being measured. By having only two anvils, and give the bore contacting faces of the anvils a radius of curvature close to the radius of the bore being measured, range of movement of the anvils, and therefore the range of measurement of the device, can be increased since any tilting of the gauge in the bore is compensated for by the curved faces of the anvils.
