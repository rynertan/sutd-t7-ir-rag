# Method of controlling a broad spectrum of weeds in a crop area and composition for the method.

## Abstract
A method of controlling a broad spectrum of weeds in a crop area, notably a vineyard or fruit plantation, by applying a selectively herbicidal composition that contains different active herbicidal ingredients the combination of methyl 5 2,4 dichlorophenoxy 2 nitrobenzoate as a first active in gredient I and 3 tert.butyl 5 chloro 6 methyl uracil as a second active ingredient II is applied onto the crop area, generally in an amount sufficient to provide 2 kg to 5 kg of the combination per each hectare of crop area. The composition for carrying out the method comprises a mixture of the first active ingredient I and the second active ingredient II containing 1 to 5 parts, by weight, of the second active ingredient II per each part, by weight, of the first active ingredient I .
