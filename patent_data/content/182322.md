# Rotational position detection device.

## Abstract
The rotational position detection device comprises a stator section 1 including primary and secondary windings W1, W2 and a rotor section 2 disposed in such a manner that it is capable of performing relative rotational displace ment with respect to the stator section. A conductive sub stance portion 2b is provided in the form of a predetermin ed pattern. The amount of flux passing through the conduc tive substance portion of the rotor section 2 changes in ac cordance with a relative rotational position of the rotor sec tion with respect to the stator section 1 and therefore an eddy current flows through the conductive substance por tion. Reluctance is caused to change by a loss due to this eddy current and a secondary output signal corresponding to the rotational position is produced in the windings of the stator section. The pattern of the conductive substance por tion 2b can be formed easily by using electro plating or other surface processing technique. The rotor section 2 may be of a shape such that the rate of the reluctance change is enhanced by the combination of the magnetic substance portion 2a and the conductive substance portion.
