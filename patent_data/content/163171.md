# Apparatus for analyzing the interface between a recording disk and a read write head.

## Abstract
A read write head is provided with a plurality of piezoelectric transducers which produce signals related to its movement as it flies over an adjacently rotating recording disk. By filtering these signals to determine their spectral components in low, medium and high ranges, hard contacts between the head and disk, disk wear or roughness and head movement can be determined. The read write head 12 is mounted on a conventional suspension arm 10 and has a head motion detector 20 mounted at its trailing edge 18 . A leading edge transducer 24 and a trailing edge transducer 26 are bonded to the head as shown. The transducers 24, 26 each comprise two piezoelectric blocks 28, 30 separated by negative electrode 32 . The signal V1 produced by transducer 24 provides information about the disk surface and about the dynamic movement of the leading edge of the transducer and the signal V2 provides similar information about the trailing edge. In suitable circuitry the signal V1, V2 and the signal in line 22 from detector 20 are processed to provide the desired information.
