# Head positioning transducer for helical scan video reproducer.

## Abstract
A head positioning transducer is disclosed as shown in Figure 2 for use with a rotating drum assembly 10 for scan ning a magnetic tape along a plurality of adjacent helically positioned record tracks, wherein the transducer includes a permanent magnet field assembly 22 and a drive coil 20 positioned adjacent thereto mounted on a cantilevered beam 16 , at one end of which a playback head 12 is mounted, such that a drive current supplied to the coil produces a field which interacts with the field of the magnet, causing a force on the coil and beam, resulting in controlled movement of the head transverse to the record tracks.
