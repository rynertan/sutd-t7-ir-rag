# Zinc oxide voltage non linear resistor.

## Abstract
A voltage nonlinear resistor comprising a sintered body 2 containing zinc oxide as a main component, a high resistivity layer 3 covering the side surfaces of the body, and a pair of electrodes 5 attached to end faces of the body so that the electrodes are separated from each other by the high resistivity layer. The high resistivity layer 3 contains iron oxide. The re sistor has an excellent current impulse withstand characteris tic and stable characteristics.
