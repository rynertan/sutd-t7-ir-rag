# A flexible remote control.

## Abstract
In opposite end fittings of a flexible remote control, improved anchoring of the outer ball races 16 17 is achieved by providing within each end fitting fixed 27 and slidable 23 anchors, the fixed anchors being attached to opposite ends 25 of one of the ball races and the slidable anchors being attached to opposite ends 21 of the other of the ball races, the slidable anchors being arranged for sliding contact with the race attached to the fixed anchor while the fixed anchors are at least partially cylindrical so that they can rotate in their end fittings 29 the fixed and slidable anchors being formed with slots 28 24 through which the push pull blade 20 of the control passes and which help prevent bowing of the blade when subjected to heavy push load.
