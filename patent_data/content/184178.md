# SWITCHING RELAIS

## Abstract
A temperature compensated switching relay with ther rally effected stitching delay should be of simple and compact construction and reliable in switching with precisely adjustable switching delay. For this purpose, the switching relay comprises a switching member 1 movable between two end positions and bearing a permanent magnet 2 , with an inherent snapping action to actuate at least one switching contact 6 , on opposite sides of the permanent magnet 2 in its direction of movement a first and a second paramagnetic member 3, 4 is provided, on the first paramagnetic member 3 a PTC resistor 5 feedable by a source of current is mounted, and in the end position of the switching member 1 at the second paramagnetic member 4 the distance A of the permanent magnet 2 from the first paramagnetic member 3 is less than its distance B from the second paramagnetic member 4 . The ratios of the distances of the permanent magnet 2 from the paramagnetic members 3, 4 can expediently be adjusted.
