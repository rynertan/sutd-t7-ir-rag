# Improved automatic straight knitting machine.

## Abstract
Inserted in each slit 3 of the needle bed this machine is a needle underneath which is placed a blade element 5 that is provided with three butts, namely a first butt 6 at the top, a second butt 7 below, and a third butt 8 at the bottom. The said third and last butt is carried by a tailpiece 35 able to oscillate or undergo flexure, in contrast with elastic means, inside the corresponding slit. The selection of a blade element 5 is defined by the operation of a selector element 11, integral with the carriage 1, whereby the first butt 6 is intercepted causing the blade element to be raised from the neutral position R. Through action exerted on the third butt 8 by an operat ing cam 12, the blade element 5 is raised further in cases when the selection operation is fully satisfactory should this not be the case, as also when the blade element is in the neutral position R, the cam 12 acts as a guide for the said third butt 8 in order to reach, or maintain, the said neutral position R.
