# Axle clamp for filament reinforced synthetic material leaf springs.

## Abstract
An improved axle clamp is required, particularly for use with composite material leaf springs, to securely fix the posi tion of the leaf spring relative to the axle or other wheel carry ing member such as in the suspension system of an automo tive vehicle. The present invention provides an axle clamp comprising a clamp base 1 and a wedge insert 2 . The clamp base provides a plafform portion 3 and substantially parallel side walls 4A, 4B extending from the platform portion to form a channel adapted to receive the wedge insert. The inner sur face of at least one side wall of the clamp base provides a channel widening concavity 5A, 5B . The wedge insert has a platform portion 7 and substantially parailel side walls 9A, 9B extending from the platform portion forming an inner chan nel adapted to jacket a mid portion of the leaf spring 10 . The outer surface of at least one side wall of the wedge insert pro vides a convexity adapted to engage and substantially fill the channel widening concavity of the clamp base. According to one embodiment, an axle clamp assembly comprises the clamp base and wedge insert and further comprises a clamp plate 12 positioned over the leaf spring opposite the clamp base and adapted to be attached thereto to hold the leaf spring securely between them. Optionally, a resilient pad 11 is pro vided mediate the leaf spring and the clamp plate.
