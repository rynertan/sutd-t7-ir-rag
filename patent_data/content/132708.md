# Crystalline metal aluminophosphates.

## Abstract
Novel class of crystalline microporous metal alumino phosphate compositions containing as lattice constituents in addition to A10₂ and PO₂ structural units, one or a mixture of two or more of the metals Mg, Mn, Co and Zn in tetrahedral coordination with oxygen atoms. These compositions are prepared hydrothermally using organic templating agents and are suitably employed as catalysts or adsorbents.
