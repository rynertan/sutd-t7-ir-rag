# COATED UNIAXIALLY ORIENTED POLYESTER FILM

## Abstract
A process for preparing a uniaxial polyester film which comprises a extruding a moving molten web of polyester film and b quenching the moving web to solidify it in a substantially amorphous form and c applying a coating of a dispersed aqueous composition of polyvinyl alcohol or polyurethane to at least a portion of the surface of said film and d stretching the moving web in a direction transverse to the direction of motion while heating the web at a temperature of from about its glass transition temperature to about 160 C and e crystallising the transversely restrained moving web by heating it to a temperature in the range of 130 C to 240 C without stretching said web and f cooling said web to substantially ambient atmospheric temperature.
