# Tire liner and method of preparation.

## Abstract
An improved annular shaped tire liner which is adapted to fit inside of, around and in contact with a casing of a pneumatic tire and in compression by the casing and a method for preparing the tire liner is described. The liner has a thickness which provides substantial protection against penetration of the tire to the inside 103 of the casing. The tire liner is characterized by having a section which is an annular strip 10 of high pressure and temperature vulcanized and molded rubber, preferably of the type used for bonding to the outside of a tire casing as a tread. Usually ends of the annular strip are joined by a thin section of low temperature and pressure vulcanized rubber. The low temperature and pressure vulcanized rubber is preferably derived from a vulcanizable rubber used to bond the molded rubber to a tire casing and is sometimes referred to as cushion rubber . Preferably sheets 11, 19 of flexible low temperature and pressure vulcanized rubber encase the annular strip of high pressure and temperature molded rubber and strips of low temperature and pressure vulcanized rubber are provided along the sides of the first annular strip. The low temperature and pressure vulcanized rubber preferably has been vulcanized in a mold cavity which has the shape and dimensions of the inside of a tire casing and preferably a tire casing is used as the mold cavity.
