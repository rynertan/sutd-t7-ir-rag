## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION ACYLOXYALKOXY CARBONYL DERIVATIVES AS BIOREVERSIBLEPRODRUG MOIETIES FOR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY AMINEFUNCTIONS IN DRUGS, THEIR PREPARATION AND PHAMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING SAID DERIVATIVES.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Drugs or pharmaceutical and medicinals which are amines or have an amine function therein undergo protonation at physiological pH and are not always transported optimally through biological membranes in the body. No bioreversible chemical modification of the amine type drugs, or pharmaceutical and medicinals having amine functions thereon to prevent protonation are known. Eneamies have been studied in the past, but they depend on acid catalyzed hydrolysis for regeneration, not on an enzymatic process, and thus are unsatisfactory. Aiso, carbamate ester latentiation of physiologically active amines has been described in A. J. Verbiscar and L. G. Agood, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 13, 1176 1970 , but these compounds were also not bioreversible. For the purposes of this specification, the term prodrug denotes a derivative of a known and proven primary or secondary amino functional drug e.g. timolol, methyldopa, thiabendazole, etc. which derivative, when administered to a warm blooded animal, cleaves in such a manner as to release the proven drug form at its target site or sites of activity. The enzymatic and or chemical hydrolytic cleavage of the compounds of the instant invention occurs in a manner such that the proven drug form is released while the remaining cleaved moiety remains nontoxic and is metabolized in such a manner that nontoxic, metabolic products are produced.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION For compounds which ionize the rate of transport through biomembranes appear to be proportional to the concentration of undissociated molecules and the lipid solubility. It is often advantageous to perform derivatization of polar groups to aid absorption, since this would make the compounds more hydrophobic and hence more lipid soluble. Carbamylation confers such properties to amines since carbamates do not ionize. However, success with carbamate ester latentiation requires that it must be hydrolyzed to carbamic acid and the alcohol moiety after penetration through the biological barrier. This is especially true of carbamates of secondary amine 5, the rates of hydrolysis of which are 105 109 times slower than that of the corresponding primary amines.In this regard, there does not appear to be a carbamate ester specific hydrolytic enzyme in mammals. Though cholinesterases hydrolyze carbamates and become reversibly inhibited in the process, the rates are too slow for practical use. Hence, modified carbamates with an enzymically hydrolyzable ester function are designed as prodrugs for amines.Esterase catalysed hydrolysis of the ester moiety triggers the regeneration of the parent amine from such derivates as depicted below.EMI3.1 wherein RR N, R1, R2 and R3 are as defined further along. Thus, it is an object of this invention to provide acyloxyalkoxy carbonyl derivatives as bioreversible prodrug moieties for drugs or medicaments having primary or secondary amine functions thereon which when administered to warm blooded animals are characterized as being more readily bioavailable, less irritating to topical and gastric mucosal membranes and more permeable through topical membranes, e.g., ophthalmic membrane or skin, than are the parent drugs from which they are derived. Thus, the prodrugs of the amines of the present invention may be used wherever increased biomembrane transport is beneficial such as in improving the bioavailability from the gastrointestinal tract, the rectum, the skin, and the eye.As such, the prodrugs of the instant invention can be incorporated in the usual dosage forms such as tablets, capsules, suspensions, ointments, and the like, depending on the particular drug or medicament and its target area. It is another object of the present invention to provide such prodrug form of conventional primary and secondary amine compounds which, following administration, will cleave in such a manner as to enable the original parent moiety to be released at its therapeutic site or sites of activity and to further permit the cleaved moiety, unassociated with the parent moiety, to be metabolized in a nontoxic fashion. It is still another object of this invention to provide prodrugs of medicaments or drugs having primary or secondary amine functions thereon to provide increased biomembrane transport such that the drug is more bioavailable from the GI tract, the rectum, the skin and the eye of the human body. A further object of this invention is to provide prodrug compounds which utilize hydrolytic enzymes to generate the parent amine type drug from the prodrug or carbamate protecting group. It is a still further object of this invention to provide prodrugs of amines wherein the ester function is remote from the carbamate carbonyl and thus through enzymatic hydrolysis lead to the generation of carbamic acid which will undergo fast decarboxylation releasing the amine parent drug. The acyloxyalkoxy carbonyl derivatives of the instant invention which are proposed as bioreversible prodrug moieties for primary and secondary amine functions in medicaments or drugs having these functions can be represented by the following formula EMI5.1 Formula I wherein RR N represents the primary or secondary amine drug, pharmaceutical or medicament.R1 and R2 can be different or the same radical and are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen or alkyl having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl or pentyl or substituted C16 alkyl wherein the substituents are carboxyl or C1 5alkoxycarbonyl.R3 is alkyl having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, hexadecyl and the like alkenyl having from 2 to 20 carbon atoms such as butenyl, hexadecenyl, and the like alkynyl having from 2 to 5 carbon atoms such as propargyl aryl such as phenyl aralkyl having from 6 to 8 carbon atoms such as benzyl cycloalkyl having from 3 to 8 carbon atoms such as cyclohexyl or cyclopentyl cycloalkenyl having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms such as cyclohexenyl carboxyalkyl wherein the alkyl group has from 2 to 20 carbon atoms such as succinyl or glutaryl carboxy cycloalkyl wherein the cycloalkyl group has from 5 to 20 carbon atoms such as carboxycyclohexyl, haloalkyl wherein the alkyl portion has from 2 to 20 carbons and halo is chloro, bromo, iodo or fluoro, such as chlorohexyl or chloropentyl alkoxy carbonylalkyl wherein the alkyl carbonyl portion has from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and the alkoxy portion is C15 such as carbethoxy hexyl alkylsulfoxide wherein the alkyl group has from 2 to 20 carbon atoms such as ethyl sulfinyl propyl carbamyl substituted alkyl or aralkyl having from 2 to 20 carbon atoms such as hexylcarboxamide saturated or unsaturated mono or polyheterocyclics having from 1 to 3 rings and having one or more of nitrogen, sulfur or oxygen atoms in the rings such as, for example, furyl, morpholinyl, oxazolidinyl, 1,2,5 thiazolyl and the like.

A general method for producing the prodrugs of Formula I of the present invention can be represented by the following chemical equation EMI9.1 Thus the first step of the method for preparing compounds of Formula I consists of reacting a primary or secondary amine containing drug, pharmaceutical or medicidinal as described above ofFormula II with an alkyl formate compound of FormulaIII wherein X is chloro, bromo or iodo or a similar group that undergoes ready neucleophilic displacement such as tosyl and Y represents a halogen or amine conjugate such as a pyridinium ion or a good leaving group substituted phenoxy such as p nitrophenoxy, dinitrophenoxy, fluorophenoxy or difluorophenoxy and wherein R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen or alkyl having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms or substituted alkyl wherein the substituent is carboxyl or C15 alkoxycarbonyl. This first step of the reaction Formula II to III can be carried out in halogenated solvents such as chloroform or dichloromethane or in other nonprotic ether solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diethylether, dimethoxyethane, and the like or other solvents such as ethylacetate or acetonitrile. The reaction can be carried out at temperatures from 780C to 500C but preferably is carried out at OOC to room temperature. This first step of the reaction is also carried out in the presence of a base such as pyridine, triethylamine, l,8 bis dimethylamino , naphthalene, N methylmorpholine and the like. The first step of the reaction gives a derivative shown as Formula IV in the above equation. The second step of the reaction for preparing compounds of Formula I consists of displacing the X moiety with an acyl group and employs as a reactant for carrying them out an alkali or alkaline earth salt of a carboxylic acid or a metal salt of carboxylic acid. The metal ion M is selected from an alkali or alkaline earth metal such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, or can be a metal selected from silver, mercury, zinc and the like. This second step of the reaction can be carried out in a solvent which is inert to the reactant such as alcohol, water, dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoramide, acetonitrile or an organic acid such as acetic acid, propionic acid, and the like. This step of the reaction is carried out between ambient or room temperature to the boiling point of the particular solvent employed, but preferably between 250C to 1500C. Both the first step of the reaction and the second step of the reaction are continued until the intermediate product IV and the final product I are respectively formed. The final product I can be isolated from the reaction mixture by methods known in the art such as by filtration or extraction into a solvent and concentration of the solvent to the particular compound of Formula I. The prodrug compounds of Formula I of our invention can be used to treat any condition for which the parent amine or secondary amine containing drug, medicament or pharmaceutical is useful for.For example, if timolol is the parent drug of choice, the prodrug can be used for any condition or treatment for which timolol would be administered. Thus, the prodrug compounds of Formula I may be administered orally, topically, parentally, by inhalation spray or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional, non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparation. Formulations for oral use include tablets which contain the active ingredient in admixture with non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.These excipients may be, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium chloride, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, maize starch, or alginic acid binding agents, for example, starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc.The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil. Aqueous suspensions usually contain the active materials in admixture with appropriate excipients. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia dispersing or wetting agents which may be a naturally occurring phosphatide, for example, lecithin a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid, for example, polyoxyethylene stearate a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol, for example, heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate or a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example, ethyl, n propyl, or p hydroxybenzoate one or more coloring agents one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents such as sucrose or saccharin. Oily suspension may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example, arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example, beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an antioxidant such as ascorbic acid. Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives.Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example, sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil in water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example, olive oil or arachis oils, or a mineral oil, for example, liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally occurring gums, for example, gum acacia or gum tragacanth naturally occurring phosphatides, for example, soybean lecithin and esters including partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example, sorbitan mono oleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents. Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non toxic parenterallyacceptable diluent or solvent. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, 1,3 butanediol, Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium.For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono or diglycerides. Fatty acids such as oleic acid also find use in the preparation of injectibles. The compounds of Formula I may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug, for example, cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions, suspensions or the like containing the prodrugs are employed according to methods recognized in the art. Naturally, therapeutic dosage range for the compounds of the instant invention will vary with the size and needs of the patient and the particular pain or disease symptom being treated. However, generally speaking, the following dosage guidelines will suffice. On an oral basis, the therapeutic dose required for a compound of the instant invention will generally, on a molecular basis, mimic that for the parent primary or secondary amine drug. On a topical basis, application of an 0.01 to 2.5 concentration of a compound of the instant invention in a suitable topical carrier material to the affected site should suffice. From the foregoing description, one of ordinary skill in the art can easily ascertain the essential characteristics of the instant invention, and without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, can make various changes and or modifications of the instant invention to adapt it to various usages and conditions. As such, these changes and or modifications are properly, equitably and intended to be, within the full range of equivalence of the following claims. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration.For example, a formulation intended for the oral administration of humans may contain from 5 mg to 5 gm of active agent compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition. Other dosage forms such as ophthalmic dosage forms contain less active ingredient such as for example from 0.1 mg to 5 mg. Dosage unit forms will generally contain between from about 0.1 mg to about 500 mg of active ingredient. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general heath, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.
