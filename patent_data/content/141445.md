# Stand alone functional apparatus comprising a micro computer.

## Abstract
A stand alone functional apparatus such as a television receiver comprising a control circuit in the form of a micro computer and a plurality of processing circuits which operate under the control of status data applied thereto from the control circuit, and possibly apply status data to the control circuit. To protect this micro computer against external disturbances, a plurality of addressable non volatile memory locations are present in which auxiliary status data for at least one processing circuit are stored. The program store of the micro computer comprises a plurality of control programs and also a recovery program. The latter is made operative in response to a disturbance, causing the auxiliary status data to be applied to the relevant processing circuit s . To enable the determination of a disturbance, at least one of the control programs includes a check program.
