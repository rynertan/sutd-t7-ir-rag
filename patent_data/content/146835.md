## Description
SYNERGISTIC HERBICIDAL COMPOSITICNS Background of the Invention The protection of crops fran weeds and other vegetation which inhibit crop growth is a constantly recurring problem in agriculture.To help combat this problem researchers in the field of synthetic chemistry have produced an extensive variety of chemicals and chemical formulations effective in the control of such unwanted growth. Chemical herbicides of many types have been disclosed in the literature and a large number are in commercial use. In some cases, active herbicides have been shown to be more effective in combination than when applied individually. The result is often termed synergism, since the combination demcnstrates a potency or activity level exceeding that which it would be expected to have, based on a knowledge of the individual potencies of the components. me e present invention resides in the discovery that certain thiolcarba mates and certain pyrrolidones, already known individually for their herbicidal potency, display this effect when applied in canbination. Prior Art The two classes of compounds forming the combination which is the subject of the present invention are independently known in the art for their effects on plant growth. Thiolcarbamates are disclosed as herbicides in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,185,720 Tilles et al., May 25, 1965 , 3,198,786 Tilles et al., August 3, 1965 , and 2,913,327 Tilles et al., November 17, 1959 . Pyrrolidones are disclosed as herbicides in U.S.Patent Nb. 4,110,105 Teach, August 29, 1979 . Description of the Invention It has now been discovered that synergism in the control of undesirable vegetation is exhibited by compositions comprising a mixture of the following two components a an herbicidally effective amount of a thiolcarbamate of the formula EMI2.1 in Which X is hydrogen, chlorine or bromine and R1 and R2 are independently selected from the group consisting of C1 C6 alkyl and C5 C7 cycloalkyl, and b an herbicidally effective amount of a pyrrolidone compound of the formulaEMI2.2 in which X is hydrogen, chlorine or methyl Y is hydrogen, chlorine, or bromine Z is chlorine or bromine R3 is hydrogen, alkyl, acetyl, chlorine, bromine, fluorine, iodine, trifluoromethyl, nitro, cyano, alkoxy, alkylthio, alkylsulfinyl, alkylsulfonyl, trifluoromethylthio, trifluoro methylsulfinyl, trifluoromethylsulfonyl, pentafluoropropion amido, or 3 methylureido R4 is hydrogen, alkyl, chlorine, or trifluoromethyl and R5 is alkyl or hydrogen. The term alkyl is used herein to denote both straight chain and branche iain groups. Examples of alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, sec butyl, isobutyl, etc. All carbon atom ranges are inclusive of their upper and lower limits. Examples of thiolcarbamates useful in the present invention are 1. S benzyl dipropylthiocarbamate 2. S benzyl ethyl, 1,2 dimethylpropylthiocarbamate 3. S 2 chlorobenzyl N,N diethylthiocarbamate 4. S 4h1orobenzyl ,Ndiethylthiolcarbamate These and other thiolcarbamates within the scope of this invention can be prepared by the procedures described in U.S. Patent Nos.2,913,327, 3,185,720, and 3,198,786 mentioned above, and U.S. Patents 3,144,475, 2,992,091 and 3,207,775. The preferred thiolcarbamate for use in the invention isS benzyl dipropyl thiocarbamate. me preferred pyrrolidone for use in the compositions of the invention is 1 mrtrifluoromethyl 3 chloro 4 chloromethylphenyl 2 pyrroli done. The terms synergism and synergistic are used herein to convey the result observed when a combination of herbicides demonstrates a potency in excess of that which the oombination would be expected to produce on the basis of the potencies of each herbicide applied individually. The term herbicide is used herein to denote a compound which controls or modifies the growth of plants. The term herbicidally effective amount is used to indicate the quantity of such a compound or combination of such compounds which is capable of producing a controlling or modifyinq effect. Controlling or modifying effects include all deviations from natural development, for example killing, retardation, leaf burn, dwarfing and the like. The term plants is used to include all postemergent vegetation, ranging from seedlings to established vegetation. In the composition of this invention, the thiolcarbamate pyrrolidone weight ratio at which the herbicidal response is synergistic lies within the range of about 0.01 1 to about 20 1, preferably about 0.1 1 to about 10 1, most preferably about 0.1 1 to about 5 1. Application rates will depend upon the weeds to be controlled and the degree of control desired. In general, the compositions of this invention are most efficiently employed at a rate of 0.01 to 50 pounds per acre 0.011 to 56 kilograms per hectare of the active ingredients, preferably 0.1 to 25 pounds per acre 0.11 to 28 kilograms per hectare . EXAMPLE I The e herbicidal responses from a combined use of 1 m trifluoro methylphenyl 3 chloro 4 chloromethyl 2 pyrrolidone Compound 1, Table I and one of four S benzyl thiolcarbamates was studied by means of greenhouse experiments. Those S benzyl thiolcarbamates employed were as follows Compound 2 S benzyl dipropylthiolcarbamate EMI4.1 Compound 3 S benzyl ethyl 1,2 dimethylpropylthiolcarbamateEMI4.2 Compound 4 S i chlorobenzyl N ,N diethvlthiolcarbamate EMI4.3 Compound 5 S 4 chlorobenzyl N,N d iethylthiolcarbamate EMI4.4 Aluminum pans measuring 18 x 12 x 5 cm were filled with a any sand soil and six furrows were impressed across the width of each flat.Four to five dicot species, the number varying among tests depending on the availability of seed, were seeded into furrows and covered with soil.The plant species included were sugarbeet SB rM Beta vulqaris L. Tefmono fumitory FUM Fumaria officinalis L. bedstraw BDQW Galium aparine L. wild mustard MD WMUS Sinapis arvensis L. ivyleaf speedwell ILSW Veronica hederaefolia L. Six of seven mcnocots, depending on the particular test, were seeded in the sane manner as the dicots species, and included blackgrass BKGR Alopecuris myosuroides Huds. wild oat WO or WHAT Avena fatua L. poverty brome PBRO Bromus sterilis L. winter barley BAIG Hordeum vulqaria L. Igri perennial ryegrass PRGR Lolium perenne L. annual bluegrass ABLG Poa annua L. winter wheat WHFL Triticum aestivum L. Flanders Chemical solutions, which were sprayed the sane day of seeding, were prepared as follows All compounds were of technical grade, except z pt compound 4, which was supplied as a 50 emulsifiable concentrate. A 1 1 ratio of acetone water was used to put technical grade compounds into solution. Compound 4 was diluted in water. The chemical solutions were delivered to the soil surface for preemergence applications by use of a linear spray table.The table was calibrated to a spray volume of 80 gallons per acre 750 liters per hectare . Each compound was applied singly at the following rates of application Compound 1 0.0625, 0.125 and 0.25 pounds per acre Compound 2, 3, 4, and 5 0.125, 0.25, 0.50 an 1.00 pounds per acre 0.07, 0.14, 0.28, 0.56 and 1.12 kilograms per hectare All possible rates of application were used for combinations ofCompound 1 plus Compound 2 or Compound 3 or Compound 4 or Compound 5. Flats were then placed in a shaded greenhouse, and watered by overhead sprinkling. Air temperatures ranged from 15 C to 270C. Flats were kept moist during the course of each experiment. Two to three weeks after treatment, each row of seedlings was visually rated for growth control due to all factors of injury. Untreated flats of seedlings were used for comparison. Zero percent injury or growth control is equivalent to growth in control flats. One hundred percent growth control is equivalent to complete kill. Herbicide interaction responses were evaluated by use of Lzmpel s formula Limpel, L.E., et al., 1962, ed Control by Dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate Alone and in Certain Combinations, Proc. NEWOC, 16 48 53 XY E X Y 100 where E expected response where X observed 0 value or percent growth control when the herbicide is applied singly and Y observed 0 value or percent z nt growth control when the second herbicide is applied singly. A response is synergistic when an observed value is greater than the calculated value. A synergistic response is understood to be one in which the interaction response is greater than the sum of responses from the individual chemical treatments.

The S benzyl thiolcarbamates described herein can also be evaluated in the same manner as in Example 1 above, by combining the S benzyl thiolcarbamates with other herbicides such as Glean commat , commomly known as chlorsulfuron, 2 chloroiN 4imethoxy 6 methyl 1,3,5 triazine 2 yl anino carbonyli benzenesulfonamide, sold by the DuPont Company, Wilmington,Delaware. Other compounds which can be evaluated in conjunction with theS benzyl thiolcarbamates referred to herein include triazines in general, such as Aatrext, 2 cNoro 4 ethylamino 6 isopropylamino S triazine, solid by Ciba Geigy Corporation and also sold under the tradename Lassos by the Monsanto Chemical Company, St. Louis, Missouri.Also, such compounds as Bladex , 2 4 chloro 6 ethylamino s triazine 2 yl amino 2methylpropionitrile, sold by the Shell Chemical Company, Houston, Texas, and others of the same general type can be evaluated. The S benzyl thiolcarbamates can also be evaluated in conjunction with phenoxyphenoxy pentanoic acid esters and pyridylphenoxy pentanoic acid esters as described in U.S. Patent Application Serial Nows, 486,730 and 486,750, filed April 20, 1983. Specific ones of these com pounds include ethyl 4 4 3 chloro, 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridyloxy phen oxy 3 hydroxypentanoate methyl 4 4 3 chloro, 5 trifluoromethyl 2 py ridyloxy phenoxy 3hydroxypentanoate and ethyl 4 4 3 chloro, 5 tri fluoromethyl 2shenoxy pherloxy3 3 ydroxypentanoate. The S enzyl thiolcarbamate canpounds can.also be evaluated in conjuntion with phenoxy, phenoxy propionic acids and esters thereof, such as are described in German Patent 2,531,643 and also pyridylphenoxy propionic acids and esters such as are described and claimed in BritishPatent 1,599,121. The oompositions of the present invention show synergistic activity as herbicides in controlling the growth of undesirable vegetation when applied to such vegetation in preemergence application. The oomposi tions are generally embodied in formulations which contain inert or occasionally active ingredients or diluent carriers in addition to the active comçounds. Examples of such ingredients or carriers are water, organic solvents, surface active agents, oil, water in oil emulsions, wetting agents, dispersing agents, and emulsifying agents. The herbicidal formulations generally take the form of wettable powders, solutions or emulsifiable concentrates. Wettable powders are finely divided compositions comprising a particulate carrier impregnated with the herbicidal compound and additionally containing one or more surface active agents. The e surface active agent promotes rapid dispersion of the powder in aqueous mediun to form stable, sprayable suspensions. A wide variety of surface active agents can be used, for examçle, long chain fatty alcohols and alkali metal salts of the sulfated fatty alcohols salts of sulfonic acid esters of long chain fatty acids and polyhydric alcohols, in which the alcohol groups are free, cmega substituted polyethylene glycols of relatively long chain length. The e herbicidal ocxnpositions can also be applied to the foliage in the form of a solution in a suitable solvent. Solvents frequently used in herbicidal formulations include kerosene, fuel oil, xylene, petroleun fractions with boiling ranges above xylene, and aranatic petroleum fractions rich in methylated naphthalenes. The IllOst preferred formulations are emulsifiable concentrates which consist of an oil solution of the herbicide along with an emulsifying agent. Prior to use the concentrate is diluted with water to form a suspended emulsion of oil droplets. The emulsifiers used are usually a mixture of anionic and non ironic surfactants. Other additives such as spreading agents and stickers can be included in the emulsifiable concentrate. The formulations described above can be applied to the vegetation sought to be controlled in any conventional manner after the vegetation has emerged from the soil or can be applied to the soil surface before seedlings emerge. The vegetation can be in any stage of develop ment after emergence, ranging from seedlings to fully grown plants.Application can be achieved by any conventional technique such as the use of ground spraying equipment or aircraft mounted sprayers. Various other application techniques will be apparent to one skilled in the pesticide art.
