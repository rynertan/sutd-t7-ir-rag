# Process for producing self crimping yarns, multifilament yarns containing latent crimp filaments, and multifilament yarns containing developed crimp filaments.

## Abstract
A yarn for producing fabrics with a wool like hand, is produced by combining textured filaments with longer fila ments preferably of larger average denier. The longer fiia ments thus protrude in loops from the yarn bundle, and have helical cross sections The textured filaments are made by spinning and converging molten polymer streams travelling at different velocities, the resulting filaments having periodic denier variations, a latent crimp and a greater shrinkage than the helical cross section filaments. When heated the latent crimp filaments shrink and acquire a developed crimp, and pull the less shrinkable helical cross section filaments into loops.

These and other aspects of the invention will in part appear hereinafter and will in part be obvious in the following detailed description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein FIGURE 1 is a vertical sectional view of a spinneret orifice FIGURE 2 is a bottom plan view of the FIGURE 1 orifice, looking up FIG JRE 3 is a graph of shrinkage versus spinning speed used in explaining the principles upon which certain aspects of the invention are based FIGURE 4 is a cross sectional view of a filament according to certain. aspects of the invention FIGURE 5 is a side elevation view of the molten streams issuing from the FIGURE 1 spinneret according to certain aspects of the invention FIGURE 6 is a graph illustrating the variation in denier along a representative filament according to certain aspects of the invention FIGURE 7 is a graph illustrating the distribution of the fluctuations illustrated in FIGURE 5 for a representative multiple orifice spinneret according to certain aspects of the invention and FIGURE 8 is a bottom plan view of another spinneret orifice. The invention will be specifically exemplified using polyester polymer, it being understood that certain aspects of the invention are applicable to the class of melt spinnable polymers generally. Polyester as used herein means fibef forming polymers at least 85Z by weight or which is tormabte by reacting a dihydric alcohol with erephehalle acid.Polyester typically is formed either by direct esterification of ethylene glycol with terephthalic acid or by ester interchange between ethylene glycol and dimethylterephthalate. FIGURES 1 and 2 illustrate the preferred embodiment of a spinneret design which can be employed for obtaining the first type of filaments according to the invention. The spinneret includes a large counterbore 20 formed in the upper surface 21 of spinneret plate 22. Small counterbore 24 is formed in the bottom of and at one side of large counterbore 20. A large capillary 26 extends from the bottom of large counterbore 20 at the side opposite small counterbore 24, and connects the bottom of large counterbore 20 with the lower surface 28 of plate 22. Small capillary 30 connects the bottom of couterbore 24 with surface 28. Capillaries 26 and 30 are each inclined four degrees from the vertical, and thus have an included angle of eight degrees. Counterbore 20 has a diameter of 0.113 inch 2.87 mm. , while counterbore 24 has a diameter of 0.052 inch 1.32 mm. .Capillary 26 has a diameter of 0.016 inch 0.406 mm. and a length of 0.146 inch 3.71 mum. , while capillary 30has a diameter of 0.009 inch 0.229 mm. and a length of 0.032 inch 0.813 mm. . Land 32 separates capillaries 26 and 30 as they emerge at surface 28, and has 2 width of 0.0043 inch 0.109 mm. . Plate 22 has a thickness of 0.554 inch 14.07 mm. . Capillaries 26 and 30 together with counterbores 20 and 24 constitute a combined orifice for spinning various novel and useful filaments according to the invention, as will be more particularly described hereinafter. FIGURE 3 is a graph showing how polyester filament shrinkage varies with spinning speed for two illustrative cases of jet stretch. The curve in dotted lines shows that the shrinkage falls from about 65 at 3400 ypm about 3100 mpm to about 5 at 5000 ypm about 4500 mpm when using spinneret capillaries having diameters of 0.063 inch 1.6 mum. and when simultaneously spinning 34 such filaments to be false twist draw textured to yield a texture yarn having 150 denier.The solid curve shows that the shrinkage drops off at higher seeds when using spinneret capillaries having diameters of 0.015 inch 0.38 mm. when similarly simultaneously spinning 34 such filaments to be false twist drawtextured to yield a textured yarn having 150 denier. Using different capillary diameters produces a family of curves between, to the left, and to the right of those illustrated.The curves also can be shifted for a given capillary diameter by varying the polymer throughput. In other words, the curves can be shifted by varying the jet stretch, which is the ratio of yarn speed just after solidification to average speed of molten polymer in the capillary. It is thus possible to provide a combined orifice for spinning a composite filament of a single polymer wherein one side of the filament has a much higher shrinkage than the other side.This is done by selecting the individual capillaries to give different jet stretches, and also selecting the spinning speed within the range wherein an individual filanent quenched from one of the individual streams would have a shrinkage at least ten percentage points higher than that of an individual filament quenched from the other of the individual streams Under the spinning conditions illustrated in FIGURE 3, at a spinning speed of 5000 yards per minute the individual streams would have shrinkage differing by about 25 percentage points. Combining these molten streams into a side by side configuration results in a highly latently crimped filament in its as spun form, without the necessity of drawing the yarn to develop the crimp.Such codbvning may be done using a spinneret design similar to that disclosed inFIGURE 1, or the spinneret may merge the two streams at or just prior to emergence of the streams from surface 28. In any event, the two streams merge substantially coincident with the face of the spinneret according to this aspect of the invention. Advantageously, the spinneret is so designed that one of the individual streams has a velocity in its capillary between 2.0 and 7 times preferably between 3.5 and 5.5 times the velocity of the other of the streams in its capillary. Further advantages are obtained when the faster of the two streams has a smaller cross sectional area than the slower of the streams, particularly in degree of crimp and spinning stability. Productivity is increased when the spinning speed is selected such that the combined filament has a shrinkage less than 20vow and is maximized when the shrinkage is less than 8 , Further aspects of the invention, applicable to melt spinnable polymers as a class, are achievable by use of spinnerets wherein the streams intersect outside the spinneret.As a specific example, molten polyester polymer of normal textile molecular weight is metered at a temperature of 2900C. through a spinneret having 34 combined oriffces as above specifically disclosed. The polymer throughput is adjusted to produce filaments of 4 average denier per filament at a spinning speed of 5200 yards per minute, the molten streams being conventionally quenched into filaments by transversely directed quenching air. Under these spinning conditions a remarkable phenoacnon occurs, as illustrated in FIGURE 5. Due to the geometry of the spinneret construction, the polymer flowing through the smaller capillaries 30 has a higher velocity than that flowing through the larger capillaries. The speeds and momenta of the paired streams issuing from each combined orifice and the angle at which the streams converge outside the spinneret are such that the slower streams 34 travel in substantially straight lines after the points at which the paired streams first touch and attach, while each of the smaller and faster of the streams 36 roams sinuous looDs back and forth between successive points of attachment 38 with its associated larger streams.This action can be readily observed using a stroboscopic light directed onto the stream immediately below the spinneret face 28. As the molten streams accelerate away from the spinneret, the slower stream attenuates between the points of attachment 35 and the loops of the faster stream become straightened until the faster stream is brought into continuous contact with the slower stream. The slower stream attenuates more between than at the points of first attachment, so that the rest combined stream has a cross section which is larger at the points of first attachment than in the regions between these points.The resulting combined stream is then further attenuated somewhat until it is solidified into a filament 40 by the transverse quench air. Each solidified filament 40 has non round cross sectional areas which vary repetitively along its length, and, after being heated while under low tension, has variable pitch S twisted and Z twisted helically cciled sections, the sections being. less tightly CoiLed in regions of large cross sectional area than in regions of small cross sectional area. As illustrated qualitatively in FIGURE 6, when using the above spinning conditions, the filament cross sectional area repetiively varies at a repetition rate of about one per meter, although this can be varied by modifying the spinning conditions and the geometry of the spinneret passages. Due to minor differences between combined orifices, temPerature gradations across the spinneret, and other like deviations from exactly the same treatment for each pair of streams, a multiple orifice spinneret will typically provide somewhat different repetition rates among the several resulting streams and filaments. An example of this is qualitatively shown inFIGURE 7, wherein is shown that various orifices produce somewhat different repetition rates as determined by stroboscopi examination of the combined streams just below the s inneret face. The repetition rate is proportiona to the stroboscope frequency bringing about apparent ceSsation or freezing of movement of the thick and thin regions of the filament. A number of such frequencies are plotted along the horizontal axis of FIGURE 7, and on the vertical axis are plotted the number of orifices giving filaments wherein such freezing was observed, at each given stroboscope frequency. In the resulting multifilament yarn, the filaments have non round cross sections which vary by more than 10 along the length of the filaments, and alternatingS twisted and Z twisted helically crimped sections, the variations in cross sectional areas being out of phase from filament to filament and the helically crimped sections being out of phase from filament to filament. For certain effects, it is advantageous that the filaments vary repetitively along their lengths by more than 25 preferably more than 30 about a mean value in cross sectional area. The effects are particularly pronounced when the yarn has a Uster unevenness of at least 2.5X U. The Uster measurement is made by using the Uster Evenness Tester, Model C, together with integrator ITG 101 for this instrument. he yarn speed is 182.8 meters per minute 200 ypm , the service selector is set on normal, ar.d the sensitivity selector is set to 12.5 . Th 7 U is read from the integrator after a s le run time of S mites. FIGURE 8 shows the preferred. embodiment of spinneret design which can be employed for obtaining the second type of filament according to the invention. The orifice is in the form of a spiral slot through the spinneret plate and extend ing over mnre than 360 degrees. An exemplary slot may have a width of 0.1 mm. and a length of 4 mm. along the length of the spiral. If the clearance between the inner end and the nearest intermediate portion of the slot is sufficiently small, the molten stream issuing therefrom will bridge the gap between the inner end of the spiral coss sectioned stream and the nearest intermediate portion of the stream cross secton, forming a filament with a spiral cross section closed at its inner end.On the other hand, if the noted clearance is slightly larger, the bridging will not occur, and the resulting filament will have a spiral cross section open at its inner end. Selection of the proper clearance to provide either a closed inner end or an open inner end while using particular spinning and quenching conditions can readily be made by one skilled in the art. Generally speaking, the filament having a crosssection comprising a spiral closed at its inner end will have a more powerful crimp than one having a cross section comprising a spiral open at its inner end. The latter will, however, have substantially increased moisture transport and moisture holding capacity as compared to the former, which is itself superior to ordinary round filaments. The second class of filaments may be spun from spinneret orifices selected such that, at the given common spinning speed, the filaments of the first class will have a higher shrinkage than those of the second class. As a specific example, molten polyethylene terephthalate polymer of normal molecular weight for textile apparel yarns is estruded simultaneously through two spinnerets, one of which contains 34 combined orifices as above described and the other of which csntais 17 spiral
