# Endothermic removal of coke deposited on sorbent materials during conversion of oils containing coke precursors and heavy metals.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for decarbonization demetallization of a poor quality residual oil feed boiling above about 340 C 650 F and comprising substantial Con radon carbon components to provide a higher grade of oil feed by contacting the poor quality oil feed with sorbent particle material containing one or more metal additives selected to catalyze the endothermic removal of coke with COâ‚‚. Sorbent decarbonization conditions are selected so that substantial quantities of carbonaceous material and metals are deposited on the sorbent in the decarbonizing zone. Sorbent material with metals and hydrocarbonaceous de posits is regenerated in the presence of an oxygen and carbon dioxide containing gas streams in separate sorbent regeneration zones at a temperature sufficiently elevated to remove residual coke to a desired low level. The selected metal additives are water soluble inorganic metal salts and hydrocarbon soluble organo metallic compounds of one or more of the following metals Li, Na, K, Sr, V, Ta, Mo, Re, Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, Sn, and Bi.
