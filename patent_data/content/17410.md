# Heat exchanger and method of manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A heat exchanger has a plastics header tank shell 12 and a metal tube plate 14 which receives a plurality of tubes 13 . The tank shell 12 is attached to the tube plate 14 by way of a plastics bead 17 , which is moulded around the edge of the tube plate 14 prior to attachment of the shell 12 by means of ultrasonic welding. Different methods of attachment of the shell 12 to the bead 17 are possible, for example by an adhesive, and the edge of the tube plate 14 may be treated in a number of ways to increase the bond between the bead 17 and the tube plate 14 , for example by means of an inwardly directed flange 16 around the tube plate edge.

## Description
IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO HEAT EXCi IANGS This invention relates to heat excilangers, and more particularly to heat cxchangers including a header tank defined by a header tank shell and an end plate of the radiator matrix. The end plates are commonly termed tube plates as they generally receive the ends of fluid carrying tubes included in the matrix. Such heat exchangers have commonly been used as motor vehicle radiators, but also find application in other fields, and can be used for example as evaporators and condensers.Header tar shells have in the past been attached to the tube plates by a number of methods. Metal shells have commonly been soldered to The tube plate, while the rore recently introduce plastics shells have been retained by mechanical clenching of the tube plate edge over a flange on the shell, a gasket interposed between the shell and the tube plate ensuring a seal between the two. In the prior arrangements there have frequently been problems ensuring economic heat exchanger manufacture and at the same time strong mechanical joints with adequate sealing.The present invention provides a method of manufacturing a heat exchanger, which includes moulding a bead of plastics material on a tube plate, and attaching a header tank shell to the plastics bead.The invention is particularly useful for attaching plastics header tank shells, but could be used in relation to metal shells. Viewed from another aspect, the invention provides a heat exchanger having a header tank attached to a tube plate, in which a bead of plastics material is moulded onto the tube plate, and the header tank is affixed to the plastics bead.Embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a cross sectional plan view through a heat exchanger header tank shell in accordance with the invention Figure 2 shows part of the header tank shell and tube plate of the heat exchanger of Figure 1 in a cross section taken on the line I I Figure 3 is a similar view to Figwre 2 showing nalternative arrangenent in accordance with the invention andFigure 4 is a similar view to figures 2 and 3 but showing a further alternative arrangement in accordance with the invention.Figure 1 is a plan view of a multi pass motor vehicle radiator 11 sectioned horizontally through its plastics header tank shell 12 to reveal a plurality of tubes 13, only some of which are shown, projecting through a tube plate 14. Header tank shell 12 has an internal web 15 which extends the full height and width of the interior of the header tank to divide the tank into two compartments. This strengthens the tank and tube plate assembly and also enables the multi pass function of the radiator. In use, coolant from the motor vehiclc s engine enters one of the two compartments, passes through the tubes communicating with that compartment until it reaches the header tank at the bottom of the radiator.From there it passes into tubes communicating with the other compartment of the illustrated header tank, through which it passes before leaving the radiator.The header tank shell 12 is affixed to the tube plate 14 along its rim and along the web 15 by the method according to the invention, as iilustrated by Figures 2 and 3. In the embodiment of Figure 2, the metal tube plate 14 has a bent over inwardly directed edge 16. Around the edge 16 and across the tube plate where web 15 is to be affixed not shown , is moulded a plastics bead 17. The tank shell 12 is attached to the plastics bead byultrasonically welding the two plastics elements together, although it could alternatively be attached by other known jointing techniques such as hot plate welding or by adhesive. By this method of attachment a water tight seal with adequate mechanical strength may be achieved without the use of the gaskets etc of the prior art. lii Figure 2, the bent over edge 16 provides a key for the plastics bead moulded onto it. In the embodiment of figure 5 a key is provided by holes 18 disposed around the edge of the tube plate, while further holes are disposed in a line across the tube plate to key that part of the bead used to provide a base for attachment of the web 15. In the embodiment of Figure 4 the bond between the plastics bead 17 and the tube plate 14 is increased by pressing into the edge of the tube plate a plurality of folds extending parallel to the edge.
