## Description
Method for Cutting a Tunnel in Rock by Means of aRock Drilling Machine This invention concerns a method for cutting a tunnel in rock by means of a rock drill comprising a tool, a striking device for delivering strokes on the tool, and a rotating device for rotating the tool. In prior art, a method is known in which, by means of a percussive rock drilling machine provided with a rotating tool, deep holes are drilled in the rock, explosive material is placed into said holes, and rock is removed by blasting so as to work the tunnel. It is known that in a rock drill a striking device delivers strikes on the tool, which in turn delivers the strikes on the rock to be cut. This method, however, involves certain drawbacks, which make its use inconvenient. Thus, the dimensional precision of a tunnel made by blasting is frequently not good enough, the blasting work is dangerous and expensive, and the transportation of the rock material out of the tunnel cannot be automated. This latter circumstance makes it necessary to move the rock drilling machine continually during the working of the tunnel to shelter for the time of the blasting and off the transport route for the time of the off transportation of the rock material, which causes periodicity in the tunneling. Moreover, blasting is not possible under all conditions, There may be explosive gas or dust in the space to be blasted. The foundations of buildings situated above the space to be blasted might be damaged, and the blasting oscillation might also damage the buildings otherwise. The rock wall remaining after the blasting may be broken and receive cracks even deep under the surface, whereby the strength and the safety of the tunnel are reduced. This is why extra working steps are required to remove readily detachable rock portions and to reinforce the walls. The object of the present invention is to eliminate the above drawbacks and to provide a method of an entirely new type for cutting a tunnel in rock by means of a rock drilling machine. The method in accordance with the invention is chsracterized in that the rock is excavated from the face of the tunnel as strips by rotating and striking the tool whereby the rock is mainly cut from the strips by means of the strokes By means of the invention, considerable advantages are obtained. Thus, by means of the method in accordance with the invention, tunnels can be cut even in hard rock as a continuous process with increased precision and speed. By means of the invention, the necessary equipment also is less expensive than in prior art. The operation of the equipment. as well as the transportation of the material can be automated The stone cuttings produced by the new method are so small than no subsequent crushing is needed, and accordingly it is possible to omit the entire crushing plant. Since the rock is not cracking, a vault construction of higher solidity and safety is additionally obtained, which mostly does not have to be coated with concrete or a similar material, not even in view of the appearance. Several working steps so far involved in tunneling, such as charging, blasting, and removal of the blasting gases, are also eliminated. The invention will be explained below in more detail with the aid of the exemplibying embodiments in accordance with the attached drawings. In the following, surface means any surface which limits the tunnel transversely to the direction of the tunnel, like the ribs, the ceiling and the floor, and face means the end face of the tunnel. While excavating the strips the tool is always ratated and stroked,First, at the beginning of each strip, the tool is drilled into the rock until it has reached a predetermined depth. After that the tool is moved in the direction of the strip parallel to the face in order to excavate the strip. The moving direction is called the feed direction of the tool. Figures la and ib are schematical illustrations of the excavating of strips by means of a tool that is perpendicular to the face to be worked, while the spacing between the strips is smaller than the diameter of the tool. Figures 2a and 2b illustrate excavating of strips by means of a tool that is perpendicular to the face to be worked, while the spacing between the strips is larger than the diameter of the bit of the tool, Figures 3a and 3b illustrate excayating of strips by means of a tool the axis of which is inclined towards the face to be worked, transversely to the direction of the feed of the tool, the spacing between the strips being larger than the diameter of the bit of the tool. Figures 4a and 4b illustrate excavating of strips by means of a tool the axis of which is inclined towards the face to be worked, in th.e direction of the feed of the tool. Figure 5 illustrates excavating of strips by means of a tool the axis of which is inclined towards the face to be worked, both in the direction of the feed of the tool and transversely thereto. Figures 6a and 6b are schematical presentations of the order of excavating subsequent strips. Figure 7 is a schematical illustration of the directions of rotation of the tool when opposite surfaces of a tunnel are being worked. Figures 8a and 8b show schematically a practical embodiment of the method according to the invention in a sectional view perpendicular to the direction of the feed of the tool. The tool 1 shown in Figure 1 is mounted at the end of the shaft 2. It can also constitute one integral tool with the shaft 2. The tool which is positioned perpendicularly to the face 3 to be worked, moves in the feed direction indicated by an arrow. The rock material 3 is removed as strips 5, whose width, as measured substantially perpendicularly to the direction of progress of the tunnel, is in this case somewhat smaller than the diameter of the tool 1 spacing A .The width of the strip may also be substantially equal to the diameter of the tool 1. The case shown in Figure 2 corresponds to that shown in Figure 1, except that the spacing A between the strips is now to such an extent larger than the diameter of the tool that a narrow ridge 4 of rock remains between the strips 5. This ridge 4 can be broken either by means of a separate breaking tool or by means of the ordinary strip excavating tool 1. In the case shown in Figure 3, the tool 1 is inclined towards the face 3 to be worked, transversely to the direction of the feed of the tool, In this case the stroke force B from the tool 1 in the rock has a component C, which is parallel to the face and directed towards the preceding strip 51. The spacingA between the strips is also in this case larger than the diameter of the tool 1 so that a narrow ridge 4 of rock is also produced as the. tool 1 moves in the direct ion of the arrow. which narrow ridge 4 in the example case, however, is broken at the same time as a result of the influence of the force component C. In Figure 4, the tool 1 is inclined towards the face 3 to be worked in the direction of the feed of the tool so that the force resulting from the stroke force of the tool is directed in the direction of the feed of the tool towards the material to be cut. In such a case, the stroke mainly facilitates the breaking of rock from the strip 5 to be cut. In Figure 5, the tool is inclined towards the face 3 to be worked both in the direction of the feed of the tool and transversely thereto whereby the component of the stroke of the tool, parallel to the face to be worked, is directed both towards the direction of the feed of the tool and towards the remaining rock ridge, thereby facilitating the breaking of rock from the strip to be excavated and, at the same time, the breaking of the remaining ridge of rock. Figure 6 schematically shows one practical embodiment of operation of the rock working as a sectional view perpendicular to the direction of the feed of the tool. The rock is excavated from the face of the tunnel as layers 7. Each layer consists of strips 5 placed side by side. In Figure 6a it is shown how five strips a to e placed side by side are cut first with the tool being in the way shown in Figure 3 inclined towards the face 3 to be worked angle ss in Figure 6a . Thus, the excavating of each layer 7 is started adjacent one of the surfaces defining the tunnel, the direction of the feed of the tool when excavating the first stripe being, e.g., parallel to said surface. After a predetermined part of the layer 7 has been excavated tool positions a to e , the remaining part is excavated, beginning adjacent the surface opposite the starting surface tool positions f to j, Figure 6b . Hereupon the excavating of a new layer is started adjacent the first mentioned defining surface tool position k . Between the excavating of two subsequent strips, the tool 1 can be pulled out from the face to be excavated for the period of time during which the tool is repositioned to the beginning of the next strip 5. Figure 7 shows schematically that opposite directions of rotation can be selected for the tool 1 when surfaces 6 are excavated on opposite sides of the tunnel. This grants, e.g., the advantage that the tool 1 is worn uniformly and the tunnel remains equally wide. Figure 7 is to be understood as an illustration of principle in so far as the excavating method illustrated therein is not restricted to cutting from the top downwards, but it is also usable, e.g., for cutting in the lateral direction. The directions of rotation of the tool may also be opposite in comparison to that whown in the figure. In Figure 8 is shown an embodiment of the method whereby the strips are excavated so that of the two adjacent strips the bottom of the first strip is located deeper in the rock than the bottom of the later excavated strip and as a result there is a stepped figure. In Figure 8a is shown the start of this method.At first a starting strip 11 is excavated into the face of the tunnel, whereafter it is then made deeper by excavating another strip 12 at the same place. After that a third strip 13 is excavated adjacent to the starting strip. The depth.of the third strip is left smaller than the depth of the starting strip so that as a result there is stepped fom. The strips may be located like in Figure 8 so that there is a ridge 4 between the strips, which ridge is broken during excavating the strips or they can be located side by side so that there is no ridge between the strips. After the strips 13, 14 on both sides have been excavated, the starting strip is excavated deeper, then the side strips and a new strip adjacent to the second strips are excavated, e.g., in the numeral order in Figure 8a.This is continued with the following strips and when all the strips on both sides of the starting strip have been excavated, the starting strip is again excavated deeper and the process is continued. The starting strip does not need to be in the middle of the face but it can be anywhere between the surfaces. After the whole face is stepped, the excavating continues perferably in the numeral order according to Figure 8b, whereby some time is saved while the tool is mainly moved only a little step from strip to strip. The depth of the excavated strip depends among other things on the characteristic of the rock and the position of the tool compared to the face of the tunnel and it can be varied widely. One preferable depth range is about 0 30 mm, whereby, e.g., there is very little need for finishing the surfaces. The number of the strips depends on the size of the face and therefore the method according to the invention is not limited to that number of the strips shown in the figures.
