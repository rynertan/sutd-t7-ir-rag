## Description
The present invention refers to an improved extractor unit for tyre vulcanizing moulds which the disassembling and reassembling operations in a simple and rapid manner without using tools. As known, the mould for vulcanizing a pneumatic tyre substantially comprises a fixed block that is apt to be connected to the frame of a vulcanising press, and a mobile block connected to the driving mechanism of the press and movable with respect to said fixed block to allow the mould to be opened and closed in the presses according to the invention, at the central part of the above said mobile block there is moreover a centering extractor unit which is able to originate the separation of the vulcanized pneumatic tyre from the mould blocks during the unloading step of the pneumatic tyre from the press. The above said extractor unit substantially comprises a body of annular shape, apt to be fixed to a mobile shaft of the press driving mechanism and a plurality of laminae radially movable in both directions with respect to said body to be led from a first configuration in which they are housed at the body inside to a second configuration in which they cooperate with the mould mobile block to obtain the blocking of the pneumatic tyre bead and vice versa. The connection between the said extractor unit and the above cited shaft is carried out through first connecting means substantially comprising two sets of radial teeth, those of a first set are obtained on the end of the first above said shaft, while the teeth of the second set are obtained on the annular body and are able to cooperate with the teeth of the other set to block the body with respect to the shaft in consequence of a relative rotation of the former with respect to the latter moreover devices are arranged in order to prevent the extractor unit from casually becoming unscrewed from said shaft. Said devices are usually constituted by screws, able to prevent the annular body from rotating with respect to the shaft before the above said devices being removed from the seats where they are housed. The centering extractor unit comprises moreover a centering ogive which axially projects from the body itself and is connected to the above said shaft too said centering ogive has the purpose of substantially maintaining in a correct position the curing bag, provided in the vulcanizing mould, during the insertion of the bag into the uncured carcass to be vulcanized, at the beginning of a new vulcanizing cycle, and during the inflation of the curing bag and the closing of the mould. The above said ogive is connected to the same shaft through second connecting means comprising two sets of radial teeth, those of a first set are obtained on the shaft and those of the second set are obtained on the ogive and are able to cooperate with toe teeth of the other set to block the ogive with respect to the shaft in consequence of a relative rotation of the former with respect to the latter. In order to prevent the ogive, from casually rotating, also in this case there are provided suitable devices usually constituted by screws apt to allow the rotation of the ogive with respect to the shaft only when said devices have been removed from opportune seats where they are housed. No document describing the prior art discussed above is known from the Applicant. However, an example of an approaching prior art is shown in the document US A 3487507. The only difference with respect to what above described consists in the fact that the ogive is directly screwed at the lower and of the movable shaft. Usually for disassembling the above described extractor unit from the press, several operations, particular attention and care are required and a considerable long time is taken. In fact, firstly, when the mould has to be disassembled from the press, and also the centering extractor unit has to be disassembled from the driving mechanism, it is necessary to wait for having the press and the various parts of the mould sufficiently cooled so as to substantially assume the room temperature in fact, the disassembling operations of the extractor unit must be carried out manually by an operator when the mould is open, i.e. when the upper block is lifted said operator gets into between the fixed block and the mobile block of the mould itself. Moreover in order to enable the operator to work with a sufficient safety, said mobile block of the mould must be blocked with respect to the fixed one, through opportune toolings in order to avoid an accidental closing of the mould. Then the operator before unscrewing the ogive and the body of the extractor unit, has to remove the above mentioned devices which are arranged so as to avoid the accidental rotation of said parts to this purpose it is necessary to act on the head of the above mentioned devices with suitable keys to remove them from their seats. Finally, the operator must operate manually the rotation of the ogive so as to release the teeth of this latter from the corresponding ones on the shaft of the press and, subsequently, to remove the ogive from the extractor unit and consequently to procede in the same manner to originate the rotation of the extractor body and its removal from the press. Finally when the new blocks have been mounted on the mould, it is necessary to raise the various parts of the mould to the vulcanizing temperature before starting the vulcanizing cycle. All the above operations take a time from seven to eight hours during which the vulcanizing mould cannot work. Blocking means is known from the document ch a 335 217 comprising a movable pin which is pushed by a spring to prevent two members of the bayonet lock from rotating the one with respect to the other. To disengage the pin from the blocking position the above document teaches to use a key. When the key is positioned for rotating around the axis of the assembly and disengaging the members of the bayonet type lock, the key pushes on the pin overcoming the resistence of the spring and displaces the blocking means to a non interference position. Even though it were possible to mount such a blocking means on the upper block of a vulcanizing mould, to remove the blocking means, in any case, it were necessary that the operator approach to the mould and act manually with the key on the inner parts of the mould. Therefore also in this case the vulcanizing mould should be kept in non working condition for a time from seven to eight hours. The present aims at realising an improved extractor unit by means of which the above mentioned drawbacks can be eliminated and in particular said disassembling operation can be carried out without waiting for the cooling of the mould and the press, without arranging opportune toolings that prevent the mould from accidentally closing and with simple and rapid operations. Accordingly, the present invention provides a centering extractor unit for pneumatic tyre vulcanizing moulds, suitable to be assembled on and operated by the driving mechanism of a press for vulcanizing pneumatic tyres, comprising a body having a substantially annular shape suitable to be fixed to a mobile shaft of said driving mechanism. and a plurality of laminae radially movable with respect to said body to be led from a first configuration in which they are housed at said body inside to a second configuration in which they radially project from said body, connection between the extractor unit and said shaft being effected through first connecting means comprising a first set of radial teeth obtained on said shaft and a second set of radial teeth obtained on said body and able to cooperate with said teeth of the first set to block the body with respect to the shaft in consequence of a relative rotation between said elements, said body being provided with first blocking means, alternatively and freely movable from a non interference position to an interference position, simultaneously with both said sets of teeth in position of mutual cooperation to prevent said body from rotating with respect to said shaft, characterized by the fact that said blocking means comprises at least a lever oscillating from said interference position, where it is maintained inserted by resilient means in a cut obtained in the teeth of said first and second set of teeth, to said non interference position, where it is disengaged from the teeth of the first set of teeth, and having a cam shaped profile against which a stake mounted on the lower part of the mould acts to automatically displace the lever to said non interference position as a consequence of a relative approach of the centering extractor unit with respect to the lower portion of the mould. A second object of the present invention is a centering extractor unit for pneumatic tyre vulcanizing moulds, suitable to be assembled on and operated by the driving mechanism of a press for vulcanizing pneumatic tyres, comprising a centering ogive axially projecting from said body and connected to a mobile shaft of said driving mechanism through second connecting means comprising a first set of radial teeth obtained on said shaft and a second set of radial teeth obtained on said ogive and able to cooperate with said teeth of the first set to block the ogive with respect to the shaft in consequence of a rotation of the ogive with respect to the shaft, and second blocking means alternatively movable from a non interference position to an interference position simultaneously with said shaft and said ogive, disposed with said sets of teeth in position of mutual cooperation to prevent said ogive from rotating with respect to said shaft, characterized by the fact that said second blocking means comprises a rod axially movable inside said ogive, and a bar hinged to said rod and movable from the interference position, where it is maintained inserted by resilient means into a pair of slits obtained in said shaft and in said ogive, to the non interference position, where it is disengaged from the slits, said rod being axially engageable by a stake mounted on the lower portion of the mould to automatically display the bar to said non interference position as a consequence of a relative approach of the centering extractor unit with respect to the lower portion of the mould. According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, said annular body, is provided with at least a hole placed under the lever and slidably engaging the stake to guide the stake against the cam shaped profile of the lever during the approach of the centering extractor unit with respect to the lower portion of the mould. Moreover the ogive is provided with at least an axial hole slidably engaging the stake to guide the latter against the rod during the approach of the centering extractor unit with respect to the lower portion of the mould. For better understanding the present invention, one of its particular embodiments will be now described in detail, by way of example, with reference to the attached drawings in which The extractor unit and the device suitable for allowing to rapidly disassemble the driving mechanism of the press, are schematically shown in figure 1, which illustrates entirely also the centripetal mould 2 for vulcanizing pneumatic tyres. Said mould substantially comprises a lower block 3 secured to a fixed platten 4, that makes part of the frame of a vulcanising press, and a mobile upper block 5 secured to a mobile platten 6 that makes part of the driving mechanism of the press itself the shown mould comprises moreover a plurality of sectors 7, each one can be radially moved with respect to the above said block under the drive of an opportune driving mechanism. The extractor unit 1, as clearly shown in figure 1, is substantially housed inside a central opening obtained in the block 5 and is connected to a shaft 8, axially movable with respect to the mould and driven by the press. The centering extractor unit 1, shown more in detail in figure 2, comprises substantially an annular body 10 which is provided with a plurality of extracting laminae 11, radially movable with respect to said body, to be led from a first configuration in which they are housed substantially inside said body to a second configuration not represented in which they project from said body so as to impede the separation of the tyre bead from the extractor unit each of said laminae is hinged to a pair of lever 12 oscillating on the body 10, able to substantially constitute with the relative lamina 11 an articulated quadrilateral a projection 13 of one of the lever 12 cooperates with an annular groove 14 obtained inside a bush 15 integral with a tubular element 16 and a rod 17, axially movable inside the shaft 8. The relative axial movement between the shaft 8 and the tubular element 16 controls the radial movement of the above said laminae with respect to the supporting annular body. A first set of radial teeth 18 in the case of the embodiment shown in figure 3 the radial teeth are three Projects from the outer surface or the lower end of the shaft 8 each of said teeth is suitable for being housed in an annular cavity 19 obtained in the upper part of the body 10, as clearly shown in figure 2. Said body is then provided with a second set of radial teeth 20, each one is disposed over a corresponding tooth 18 so as to block it inside the cavity 19. Said two sets of teeth constitute the already cited first connecting means. A slot 21 figure 3 is obtained in the body 10 between two contiguous teeth to allow the passage through it of a corresponding tooth 18 to be introduced inside the cavity 19. An oscillating lever 26 is hinged to a bracket 25 of the body 10 and is substantially disposed in a diametral plane of the body itself, the upper end 27 of the lever is inserted into a corresponding cut 28 obtained in a pair of teeth 18 and 20, so as to impede the relative rotation of the body 10 with respect to the shaft 8 when said teeth are in a position of mutual cooperation. Usually said lever is kept inside the slit due to the action of a helical spring 29, which operates under tension while, a cam shaped surface 30 is obtained in the lower part of the same to cooperate with corresponding parts of the device as it will be explained later on. Said lever 26 and the corresponding spring 29 constitute the preferred embodiment for said first blocking means and the sealing devices connected to these latter. The extractor unit comprises also an ogive 32 that axially projects downwardly with respect to the body 10 and that is arranged to cooperate with a curing bag not shown disposed on the lower part of the press, axially projecting from the lower block 3 of the mould, in order to maintain this bag substantially centered when the bag is inserted into the uncured carcass to be vulcanized, is inflated and when the mould is closed, at the beginning of each new vulcanizing cycle. Said ogive is secured to the bush 15 with the same connection as that realized for connecting the body 10 to the shaft 8 and comprising a first set of radial teeth 33 projecting from said bush and suitable for being inserted into a substantially annular cavity obtained in the ogive 32 a second set of teeth 34 obtained in the upper part of the ogive 32 are superimposed to the teeth 33 to block them inside the above said cavity. It will be clear that said two sets of teeth constitute a convenient embodiment of said second blocking means. A pair of radial slits 35 are obtained both in the bush 15 body, and in the ogive 32 body, are aligned with one another when the teeth of the bush and those of the ogive are in a position of mutual cooperation and are able to allow the insertion inside them of a bar 36 hinged to a rod 37, axially movable inside the ogive 32 and usually maintained in a first configuration, due to the action of a spring 38 which operates under compression in the above mentioned configuration, shown in figure 2, said rod is in its downwardly stop position and the bar 36 is substantially orthogonal to said rod and is inserted inside the pair of slits 35 so as to prevent the ogive 32 from substantially rotating with respect to the bush 15 the rod 37 is led into a hole 37a of the ogive itself. The rod 37 with the bar 36 and the corresponding spring 38 constitute an embodiment preferred by the Applicant for said second blocking means and devices connected to these latter. The disassembling device figure 4 comprises a dragging unit and a support 40 which is disposed over a second shaft 41 that makes part of the vulcanizing press and that passes across a central opening of the lower block 3 of the mould also said shaft, as the shaft 8, can be axially movable with respect to the press frame. The disassembling device 40 comprises a supporting platten 42 suitable to be placed on the shaft 41 in a position coaxial with said shaft, and a pair of rotatable discs 43 and 44 which are supported by a pair of rolling bearings 45. The disc 43 is integral with a shaft 46 rotatable on the platten 42 and provided with a head 47, having a central cavity 48, in which a cup shaped element 49 provided with a stake 49a is axially movable this cup shaped element is torsionally integral with the head 47 and usually is maintained in its lifted position, shown in figure 4, due to the action of helical springs 50 which operate under compression. The disc 44 is provided with a plurality of stakes 51 disposed on its periphery in such a position as to be able to enter into corresponding holes 52 obtained on the body 10, in consequence of the mutual approaching of the extractor unit to the disassembling device 40. It is better to specify that in the preferred embodiment the stakes 51 are inserted into the corresponding holes 52 while the laminae 11 are radially projecting from the unit 10, i.e. in such a position as to leave the corresponding holes 52 open, i.e. accessible to the stake 51. The just, cited elements discs, stakes, cup shaped element constitute the preferred embodiment for the above mentioned thrusting elements destined to cooperate with the blocking means disposed on the centering extractor unit, as previously described. The discs 43 and 44 are then provided with holes 53 suitable to receive the end of an opportune operating lever to drive their rotation with respect to the supporting platten 42 the disc 44 is moreover provided with a pair of flanges 54 able to cooperate with an opportune tooling destined to lift the disassembling device 40 for its drawing away from the press and positioning, with and without the extractor unit. The disassembling of the extractor unit from the driving mechanism of the press, according to the invention, takes place as follows. Suppose the last vulcanized pneumatic tyre has already been removed from the mould and the mould and the press are in the opening position shown in figures 1 and 2. In order to disassemble the extractor unit, the dragging device 40 is firstly disposed on the lower part of the press and in particular on the shaft 41 as shown in the figure 4, after having removed the curing bag. Subsequently, the shaft 16 is set in action so as to radially extend the laminae 11, then the shaft 41 is driven to move upwardly for lifting said disassembling device or in alternative the shaft 8 that supports the centering unit is lowered up to lead the shafts 51 inside the holes 52 of the body 10 and consequently at least one of them into contact with the cam shaped part 30 of the corresponding flange 26 said movement originates thus a kinematic connection between the cam shaped profile of the flange and the above stake 51, and consequently the rotation of said flange, against the resistance of the spring 29, around its hinged point, with the result of releasing said flange from the corresponding cut 28. Contemporaneously, the cup shaped element is advanced into contact with the ogive 32 so as to connect its radially inner surface with the radially outer one of the ogive and to insert the stake 49a into the hole 37a of the ogive itself said motion drives the upwardly movement of the rod 37, overcoming the elastic reaction of the spring 38. Further to said upwardly movement of the rod 37, the bar 36 rotates and reaches a second configuration, shown with a broken line in figure 2, where its end substantially comes out of the slits 35, where it was housed, eliminating thus the blocking to the relative rotation between ogive and shaft. At this stage the rotation of the disc 43 can be driven through an opportune lever inserted inside the relative opening 53 this movement rotates the ogive 32 with respect to the tubular element 16 releasing the teeth 34 from the corresponding teeth 33 of the bush 15, and consequently separates the ogive 32 from the driving mechanism of the press and places it on the cup shaped supporting element. The rotation of the ogive with respect to the bush 15 is caused by the friction between the radially outer surface of the ogive and the radially inner one of the cup shaped element or, in alternative, taking advantage of the characteristic of the stake 49a integral with the rotation with said cup. Now, making the disc 44 rotate, which is driven by an opportune lever too, the body 10 rotates due to the action of the stakes 51, so as to release the radial teeth 20 of the body 10 from the corresponding teeth 18 of the shaft 8, to set said body free from the shaft in such a manner also the extractor unit is released from the shaft 8 and remains supported by the dragging device 40 and is released from the press by lowering the shaft 41 or, alternatively, by lifting the shaft 8. The possibility of contemporaneously disassembling the annular body 10 and the ogive 32, through a sole lifting and successive lowering of the shaft 41, or vice versa of the shaft 8, constitutes a great advantage for rapidly carrying out the change of the moulds on the press. Of course, to assemble a new extractor unit and a new ogive on the press it is necessary to carry out the above described operations in the opposite direction. Therefore it is evident that by means of the device according to the invention, the operations necessary for disassembling the extractor unit from the shaft 8 and from the other parts of the mould can be carried out in a simple and rapid manner, without particular attention and care by the operator, who effects the operation remaining out of the press body moreover, it is not necessary to wait for having the various parts of the mould and the press substantially at room temperature since the operations necessary for placing the dragging device 40 over the shaft 41 and for driving the rotation of the discs 43 and 14 can be carried out also when the mould is still hot. This possibility produces a further saving of time as regards the need of leading the new mould to the use temperature before starting the vulcanization of the pneumatic tyres. It is understood that all the various parts of the above described device according to the present invention can be improved without falling out of the field of protection of the invention itself.
