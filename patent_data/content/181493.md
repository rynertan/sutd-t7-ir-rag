# Method and device for the manufacture of ceramic ware with a roller shaping tool.

## Abstract
Jiggering for ceramic ware is effected while providing a jiggering surface of a jiggering profile tool 3 with a gas to produce a thin gas film between the jiggering surface 3C and plastic clay. The gas film is formed by a gas fed through or from the outside of the jiggering surface 3C , avoiding the necessity of high temperature heating of the tool.
