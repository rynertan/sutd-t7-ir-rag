## Description
TRIAZOLE OR DIIDAZOLE FUNGICIDE COMPOSITIONS This specification describes an invention relating to a novel biocide composition comprising a triazole or imidazole fungicide and certain ureas or carbamates. Although triazole or imidazole fungicides generally have very high anti fungal activity, it is known that a few species of fungi are resistant to these chemicals. Thus, if these fungicides are used alone to preserve a substrate, such as a paint film, which will be exposed to a wide range of deteriogenic fungi, defacement of the substrate can arise from the growth of the few tolerant species. It has now been found that certain phytotoxic ureas and carbamates, which do not necessarily have good anti fungal activity, unexpectedly boost the activity of the triazole or imidazole fungicides, particularly against these tolerant fungal species, and thus broaden the spectrum of their anti fungal activity. According to the present invention there is provided a composition of an anti fungal triazole, imidazole and a herbicidal carbamate or urea. Suitable anti fungal triazoles include triazolyl alcohols, ketones and triazolyl ketals such as are disclosed generically and specifically in UK 1,264,520, UK 1,451,038, UK 1,522,657, EP 11768A,UK 1,529,818, UK 1,532,156, BE 869,163, US 3,647,810, US 3,821,376,EP 11769A, UK 2,003,731A, UK 2,064,520A, US 4,073,921 DE 2,820489A,DE 2,908,378A, EP 15756A, EP 31563A, EP 55997A, EP 40345A, EP 43419A, EP 47594A, EP 60223A, EP 69442A, EP 71568A and EP 72580A the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The relative proportions of the fungicide and herbicide may be varied within wide limits but are preferably from 20 1 to 1 20, more preferably 10 1 to 1 10 and especially preferably 1 1 to 1 5, respectively. In a preferred composition the fungicide comprises a triazole of Formula I in which X is nitrogen, Z is OH, R is H, R1 is alkyl, R2 is optionally substituted benzyl or phenyl, m I and n I 1. In such a fungicide R1 preferably contains up to 6 carbon atoms and R2 is preferably substituted in the phenyl ring by one or two C14 alkyl or halo groups, especially chloro or bromo, the substituents preferably being in the ortho and or para positions. A preferred species of this class is the compound wherein R1 is t butyl and R2 is 2 chlorobenzyl. This compound is l triazolylmethyl 1 2 chlorobenzyl 2, 2 dimethyl n propanol, hereinafter referred to as TCDP .Another preferred compound of Formula I is 1 triazolyl methyl 1 2 ,4 dichlorophenyl n pentanol, hereinafter referred to as TDP .

An especially preferred composition comprises the fungicide TCDP and the urea, diuron. The composition may contain other ingredients, such as other biocides, diluents, solvents, dispersants etc and a preferred composition contains from 10 to 30Z by weight of the herbicide and from 5Z to 15Z by weight of the fungicide in the form of an aqueous dispersion. The composition of the present invention has unexpectedly enhanced anti fungal activity compared with the activity of either component alone, i.e. the combination is synergistic. The composition is especially suitable for the preservation of paint films against the growth of fungi but may be used in other, non agricultural environments where fungal growth is a problem, e.g.in the preservation of wood, leather, textiles, paper products adhesives and polymers. According to a further feature of the present invention there is provided a method for the preservation of a medium susceptible to fungal growth against such growth which comprises incorporating into or applying to the surface of the medium a fungal inhibiting quantity of a composition of an anti fungal triazole or imidazole . and a herbicidal carbamate or urea as hereinbefore described. The quantity of the composition may be varied within wide limits but is preferably used in amounts such that the total amount of fungicide and herbicide is from 0.01X to 10X, by weight, based on the weight of the medium being protected, and more preferably from 0.05Z to 5 . Where the medium to be protected is a paint film the composition is conveniently incorporated into the paint, e.g. during the manufacture or packing thereof, so that it is evenly distributed in the paint film after application to a substrate. The synergistic effect associated with the present composition is demonstrated in the following Examples which further illustrate the invention and in which all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise illustrated.Example 1 Fifty different fungal species, representative of the wide range of naturally occuring deteriogens, were screened for tolerance to various anti fungal agents and to compositions of the anti fungal agents with the herbicidal urea, diuron. The number of fungal species tolerant to a range of known anti fungal agents at different levels and to diuron is shown in Table 1.

In contrast, diuron has virtually no effect on the activity range of the other anti fungal agents.Example 2 MIC s were determined, using the general method described inExample 1, for three triazole or imidazole fungicides alone and two herbicidal ureas alone against the two fungal species, Scolecobasidium humicola S. humicola and Trichocladium canadense T. canadense , which were resistant to the action of the triazole,TCDP. MIC s were also determined for combinations of the three triazole or imidazole fungicides with various fixed levels of the ureas. The fungicides and herbicides and their MICs, alone and in combination, against the two fungal species are set out in Table 3. Table 3MICs of the Antifungal Agents alone and in combination with Ureas ChemicallComposition MIC ppm S humicola T canadense TCDP 100 125 TDP 128 Diuron 125 150 Neburon 400 400TCDP 5 ppm Diuron 25 25TCDP 25 ppm Diuron 5 10TCDP 5 ppm Neburon 25 25TCDP 25 ppm Neburon 10 25 TDP 5 ppm Diuron 32 TDP 25 ppm Diuron 16 The results in Table 3 show that the chosen organisms are significantly more resistant to triazoles than the other 48 fungal species included in the experiments reported in Example 1 because theMICs of the agents in respect of these species are at least 100 ppm compared with a maximum of 5 ppm in respect of the other 48 fungal species and that they are even more resistant to the herbical ureas.The results also show, quite clearly, that a composition of the fungicide with the urea is inhibitory at levels well below the levels at which either compound, taken alone, inhibits growth of the two fungal species. This demonstrates that the composition is truly synergistic. Example 3 MIC s were determined, using the general method described inExample 1, for the triazole fungicide, TCDP, alone and a number of herbicidal ureas and carbamates alone against the organism Scolecobasidium humicola S humicola and for the combinations ofTCDP with various fixed levels of the herbicides.

The panels were exposed in the open air in jungle site in Puerto Rico, set in a vertical plane facing south.They were examined at regular intervals to determine the period of exposure in months for at least 70Z of the panel to become defaced by fungal growth. The results are recorded in Table 5.

This assessment demonstrates that the synergistic action of the present compositions is also effective in an important application.
