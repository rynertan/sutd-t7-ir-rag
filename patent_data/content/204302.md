## Description
LAMININ AND THE PRODUCTION THEREOF This invention relates to the production of laminin. More particularly, this invention relates to human laminin and its recombinant DNA directed synthesis1 and laminin s use in the treatment of basement membrane damage or degeneration. Laminin is a major component of basement membranes. Basement membranes are highly organized structures which support and regulate the passage of macromolecules across the epithelium. Laminin is a large glycoprotein molecular weight of 1,000,000 which is synthesized by epithelial cells and localized to basement membranes. As the major noncollagenous component of the basement membrane, laminin is believed to have several major functions. First, it regulates the formation of the basement membrane. Second, it influences the types of cells which abut the membrane by encouraging epithelial cell attachment and inhibiting fibroblast attachment.Third, laminin provides an environment for the continuing survival of epithelial cells by its attachment, growth factor, and mitogenic properties toward epithelial cells.A review of the evidence supporting these postulated in vivo properties and the mechanisms thereof can be found in The Role of Laminin in Basement Membranes and in theGrowth, Adhesion, and Differentiation of Cells, byKleinman, et al., The Role of Fxtracellular Matrix inDevelopment, pages 123 143, 1984 Alan R. Liss, Inc., NewYork, New York and the references contained therein. In general, recombinant DNA techniques are known, See Methods In Enzvmology, Academic Press Volumes 65 and 68 1979 100 and 101 1983 and the references cited therein, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. An extensive technical discussion embodying most commonly used recombinant DNA methodologies can be found in Maniatis, et al., Molecular Cloning, ColdSpring Harbor Laboratory 1982 . Genes coding for various polypeptides may be cloned by incorporating a DNA fragment coding for the polypeptide in a recombinant DNA vehicle, e.g., bacterial or viral vectors, and transforming a suitable host. This host is typically an Escherichia coli F.. coli cell line, however, depending upon the desired product, eukaryotic hosts may be utilized.Clones incorporating the recombinant vectors are isolated and may be grown and used to produce the desired polypeptide on a large scale. Mixtures of mRNA from eukaryotic cells employing a series of three enzymatic reactions to synthesize double stranded DNA copies of entire genes which are complementary to this mRNA mixture have been isolated. In the first reaction, mRNA is transcribed to form a single stranded complementary DNA cDNA by anRNA directed DNA polymerase, also called reverse transcriptase. Reverse transcriptase synthesizes DNA in the 5t 3 t direction, utilizes deoxyribonucleoside 5 triphosphates as precursors, and requires both a template and a primer strand, the latter of which must have a free 3 hydroxyl terminus. Reverse transcriptase products, whether partial or complete copies of the mRNA template, often possess short, partially double stranded hairpins loops at their 3 termini.In the second reaction, these hairpin loops can be exploited as primers for DNA polymerases. Preformed DNA is required both as a template and as a primer in the action of DNA polymerase. The DNA polymerase requires the presence of aDNA strand having a free 3 hydroxyl group, to which new nucleotides are added to extend the chain in the 5 3 direction. The products of such sequential reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase reactions still possess a loop at one end. The apex of the loop or fold point of the double stranded DNA, which has thus been created, is substantially a single strand segment. In the third reaction, this single strand segment is cleaved with the single strand specific nuclease S1 to generate a blunt end duplex DNA segment.This general method is applicable to any mRNA mixture, and is described by Buell, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 253 2483 1978 . The resulting double stranded cDNA mixture ds cDNA is inserted into cloning vehicles by any one of many known techniques, depending at least in part on the particular vehicle being used. Various insertion methods are discussed in considerable detail in Methods InEnzymology, 68 16 18, and the references cited therein. Once the DNA segments are inserted, the cloning vehicle is used to transform a suitable host. These cloning vehicles usually impart an antibiotic resistance trait on the host. Such hosts are generally prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. At this point, only a few of the transformed or transfected hosts contain the desired cDNA. The sum of all transformed or transfected hosts constitutes a gene 11library11 The overall ds cDNA library created by this method provides a representative sample of the coding information present in the mRNA mixture used as the starting material. If an appropriate oligonucleotide sequence is available, it can be used to identify clones of interest in the following manner. Individual transformed or transfected cells are grown as colonies on nitrocellulose filter paper. These colonies are lysed the DNA released is covalently attached to the filter paper by heating.The sheet is then incubated with a labeled oligonucleotide probe which is complementary to the structural gene of interest. The probe hybridizes with the cDNA for which it is complementary, and this is identified by autoradiography. The corresponding clones are characterized in order to identify one, or a combination of clones which contain all of the structural information for the desired protein. The nucleic acid sequence coding for the protein of interest is isolated and reinserted into an expression vector. The expression vector brings the cloned gene under the regulatory control of a specific prokaryotic or eukaryotic control element which allows the efficient expression transcription and translation of the cloned ds cDNA.Thus, this general technique is only applicable to those proteins for which at least a portion of. their amino acid or DNA sequence is known and for which an oligonucleotide probe is available. See, generally,Maniatis, et alt, supra. More recently, methods have been developed to identify specific clones by probing bacterial colonies with antibodies specific for the encoded protein of interest. This method can only be used with expression vector cloning vehicles since elaboration of the product protein is required. The structural gene is inserted into the vector adjacent to regulatory gene sequences that control expression of the protein. The cells are lysed, either by the vector or by chemical methods, and the protein detected by the specific antibody and a labeling system such as enzyme immunoassay. An example of this is the lambda gtll system described by Young and Davis,Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sci. USA. 80 1194 1198 1983 and Young and Davis, Science, 22 778 1983 . The present invention has made it possible to provide readily available large quantities of human laminin or laminin subunits. This has been achieved with antibodies which react specifically with the laminin protein molecule, or subunits thereof, the application of recombinant DNA technology to preparing cloning vehicles encoding for the laminin protein, and screening isolating procedures for recovering human laminin protein essentially free of other proteins of human origin. Accordingly, the present invention provides human laminin or its subunits and fragments essentially free of other proteins of human origin. Characteristically, the laminin protein is glycosylated but may be in the unglycosylated form. Laminin is produced by recombinant DNA techniques in host cells or other self replicating systems and is provided in essentially pure form. The invention further provides replicable expression vectors incorporating a DNA sequence encoding human laminin and a self replicating host cell system transformed or transfected thereby.The host system is usually a prokaryotic, e.g.,E. coli, B. subtilis, or eukaryotic cells.The invention further provides a cDNA sequence which when correctly combined with an expression vector is capable of directing the synthesis of a polypeptide which is immunologically reactive with antibodies prepared against human laminin. The human laminin is produced by a process which comprises a preparing a replicable expression vector capable of expressing the DNA sequence encoding human laminin or fragments thereof in a suitable host cell system b transforming said host system to obtain a recombinant host system c maintaining said recombinant host system under conditions permitting expression of said laminin encodingDNA sequence to produce human laminin protein and d recovering said human laminin protein.Preferably, the laminin encoding replicable expression vector is made by preparing a double stranded complementaryDNA ds cDNA preparation representative of laminin mRNA and incorporating the ds cDNA into replicable expression vectors. The preferred mode of recovering the human laminin comprises reacting the proteins expressed by the recombinant host system with a reagent composition comprising at least one binding protein specific for laminin. Laminin or its fragments may be used as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of damaged or degenerated skin and other epithelial membranes. The cloned ODNA coding for human laminin is also useful as a DNA probe for the specific identification and or recovery of laminitt DNA sequences from a mixture containing same. Figure 1 illustrates a general procedure for enzymatic reactions to produce cDNA clones. Figure 2 illustrates the production of a library containing DNA fragments inserted into lambda gtll. Figure 3 illustrates elaboration and purification of a human laminin cDNA clone from a lambda gt recombinant library. a.

Figure 4 illustrates the nucleotide sequence obtained at the 5 end of Laml2. Figure 5 illustrates the nucleotide sequence obtained at the 3 end of Laml2. Figure 6 illustrates a comparison of mouse and human laminin B1 chains. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence of a mouse laminin B1 chain is shown in the top line Barlow, D.P., Green, N.M.,Kurkinen, M., and Hogan, B.L.M., EMBO Journal, 3 2355 2362 1984 . The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence of Laml2 is shown in the bottom line. Asterisks indicate non homologous amino acids. A homology of 91.6 is observed between mouse and human laminin B1 chains. Figure 7 illustrates the complete nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of Laml2, a partial cDNA clone for the human B1 laminin chain. The nucleotide sequence at the 5 and 3 ends of Laml2 is shown in Figures 4 and 5. The complete nucleotide sequence of Lam 12, shown here, includes and joins the nucleotide sequences at the 5 and 3 ends of Laml2. Nucleotide sequence was determined by the chain termination method Sanger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 74 5463 5467 1977 . Nucledide 146 in Figure 5 is erroneously reported as A, the actual nucleotide is G. As used herein, laminin denotes human laminin or its subunits or fragments thereof produced by cell or cell free culture systems, in bioactive forms having the capacity to influence cellular adhesion, growth, differentiation, and migration in vivo as does laminin native to the human basement membrane and to react with antibodies raised to human laminin. Different alleles of laminin may exist in nature. These variations may be characterized by difference s in the nucleotide sequence of the structural gene coding for proteins of identical biological function. In addition, the location and degree of glycosylation as well as other post translational modifications may vary and will depend to a degree upon the nature of the host and environment in which the protein is produced. It is possible to produce analogs having single or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions, or replacements. All such allelic variations, modifications, and analogs resulting in derivatives of human laminin which retain the biologically active properties of native human laminin are included within the scope of this invention. Expression vectors t refer to vectors which are capable of transcribing and translating DNA sequences contained therein, where such sequences are linked to other regulatory sequences capable of effecting their expression. These expression vectors must be replicable in the host organisms or systems either as episomes, bacteriophage, or as an integral part of the chromosomalDNA. One expression vector which is particularly suitable for producing laminin is the bacteriophage, viruses which normally inhabit and replicate in bacteria. Particularly desirable phages for this purpose are the lambda gt10 and gtll phage, described by Young and Davis, supra.Lambda gtll is a general recombinant DNA expression vector capable of producing polypeptides specified by the inserted DNA. To minimize degradation, upon induction with d synthetic analogue of lactose IPTG , foreign proteins or portions thereof are synthesized fused to the prokaryotic protein B galactosidase. The use of host cells defective in protein degradation pathways may also increase the lifetime of novel proteins produced from the induced lambda gtll clones. Proper expression of foreign DNA in lambda gtll clones depends upon the proper orientation and reading frame of the inserted DNA with respect to theB galactosidase promoter and ribosome binding site. Another form of expression vector useful in recombinant DNA techniques is the plasmid a circular, unintegrated extra chromosomal , double stranded DNA loop. Any other form of expression vector which serves an equivalent function is suitable for use in the process of this invention. Recombinant vectors and methodology disclosed herein are suitable for use in host cells covering a wide range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.Prokaryotics are preferred for the cloning of DNA sequences and in the Construction of vectors. For example, E. coli K12 strain HB101 ATCC No. 33694 , is particularly useful. Of course, other microbial strains may be used. Vectors containing replication and control sequence which are derived from species compatible with the host cell or system are used in connection with these hosts. The vector ordinarily carries an origin of replication, as well as characteristics capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. For example, B. coli can be transformed using the vector pBR322, which contains genes for ampicillin and tetracycline resistance Bolivar, et al., Gene, 2 95 1977 j. These antibiotic resistance genes provide a means of identifying transformed cells. The expression vector may also contain control elements which can be used by the vector for expression of its own proteins. Common prokaryotic control elements used for expression of foreign DNA sequences in E. coli include the promoters and regulatory sequences derived from the B galactosidase and tryptophan trp operons of F, coli, as well as the pR and pL promoters of bacteriophage lambda. Combinations of these elements have also been used e.g., TAC, which is a fusion of the trp promoter with the lactose operator .Other promoters have also been discovered and utilized, and details concerning their nucleotide sequences have been published enabling a skilled worker to combine and exploit them functionally. In addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic microbes, such as yeast cultures, may also be used. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or common baker s yeast, is the most commonly used among eukaryotic microorganisms, although a number of other strains are commonly available. Suitable promoting sequences in yeast vectors include the promoters of 3 phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes.Suitable expression vectors may contain termination signals which provide for the polyadenylation and termination of the cloned gene s mRNA. Any vector containing a yeast compatible promoter, origin of replication, and appropriate termination sequence is suitable for expression of laminin. In addition to microorganisms, cultures of cells derived from multicellular organisms may also be used as hosts. In principle, any such cell culture is workable, whether from a vertebrate or invertebrate source.However, interest has been greatest in vertebrate cells, and propagation of vertebrate cells in culture tissue culture has become a routine procedure in recent years.Examples of such useful hosts are the VERO, HeLa, mouse C127, Chinese hamster ovary CHO , W138, BHK, COS 7, andMDCK cell lines. Expression vectors for such cells ordinarily include an oriqin of replication, a promoter located in front of the gene to be expressed, along with any necessary ribosome binding sites, RNA splice sites, polyadenylation site, and transcriptional terminatory sequence. For use in mammalian cells, the control functions on the expression vectors are often provided by viral material. For example, commonly used promoters are derived from polyoma, Adenovirus 2, and most frequently,Simian Virus 40 SV4Q . Further, it is also possible, and often desirable, to utilize promoter or control sequence naturally associated with the desired gene sequence, provided such control sequences are compatible with the host system. To increase the rate of transcription, eukaryotic enhancer sequences can also be added to the construction. These sequences can be obtained from a variety of animal cells or oncorna viruses such as the mouse sarcoma virus. An origin of replication may be provided either by construction Of the vector to include an exogenous origin, such as that provided by SV40 or other viral sources, or may be provided by the host cell chromosomal replication mechanismt If the vector is integrated into the host cell chromosome, the latter is sufficient. Host cells can prepare human laminin proteins which can be of a variety of chemical compositions. The protein is produced having methionine as its first amino acid present by virtue of the ATG start signal codon naturally existing at the origin of the structural gene or inserted before a segment of the structural gene . The protein may also be intra or extracellularly cleaved, giving rise to the amino acid which is found naturally at the amino terminus of the protein. The protein may be produced together with either its signal polypeptide or a conjugated protein other than the conventional signal polypeptide, the signal polypeptide of the conjugate being specifically cleavable in an intra or extracellular environment. Finally, laminin may be produced by direct expression in mature form without the necessity of cleaving away any extraneous polypeptide. Recombinant host cells which have been transformed with vectors constructed using recombinant DNA techBiques. As defined herein, laminin is produced as a consequence of this transformation. taminin or its subunits or fragments thereof produced by such cells are referred to as recombinant laminin . The procedures below are but some of a wide variety of well established procedures to produce specific reagents useful in this invention. The general procedure for obtaining a messenger RNA mRNA mixture is to prepare an extract from a tissue sample or to culture cells producing the desired protein, and to extract the mRNA by a process such as that disclosed by Chirgwin, et al.,Biochemistry, 18 5294 1979 . The mRNA is enriched for poly A mRNA containing material by chromatography on oligo dT cellulose or poly U Sepharose, followed by elution of the poly A containing mRNA enriched fraction. The above poly A containing mRNA enriched fraction is used to synthesize a single strand complementary cDNA ss cDNA using reverse teanscriptase.As a consequence of DNA synthesis, a hairpin loop is formed at the 3 end of the DNA which will initiate second strand DNA synthesis. Under appropriate conditions, this hairpin loop is used to effect synthesis of the second strand in the presence of DNA polymerase and nucleotide triphosphates. The resultant double strand cDNA ds cDNA is inserted into the expression vector by any one of many known techniques. In general, methods, etc., can be found in Maniatis, suPra, and methods In Enzymology, Vol. 65 and 68 1980 and Vol. 100 and 101 1983 . In general, the vector is linearized by at least one restriction endonuclease, which will produce at least two blunt or cohesive ends. The ds cDNA is ligated with or joined to the vector insertion site. If prokaryotic cells or other cells which contain substantial cell wall material are employed, the most common method of transformation with the expression vector is calcium chloride pretreatment as described by Cohen,R.N., et al., Proc. Nat l. Sci. USA, 69 2110 1972 . If cells without cell wall barriers are used as host cells, transfection is carried out by the calcium phosphate precipitation method described by Graham and Van der Eb,Virology, 62 456 1973 . Other methods for introducingDNA into cells such as nuclear injection or protoplast fusion, have also been successfully used. The organisms are then cultured on selective media and proteins for which the expression vector encodes are produced. Clones containing part or the entire gene for laminin are identified with specific binding protein directed against part or all of the laminin protein. The specific binding protein may preferably be a primary antibody. For example, these primary antibodies include both a polyclonal antibody or a monoclonal antibody. This method of identification requires that the ds cDNA be inserted into a vector containing appropriate regulatory nucleic acid sequences adjacent to the insertion site.These regulatory sequences initiate transcription and translation of those ds cDNA molecules inserted in the vector. Those clones cointaining laminin cDNA sequences correctly positioned relative to the regulatory sequences synthesize part or all of the laminin protein. Such clones are detected using appropriately specific antibodies. Such a cloning system is the lambda gt11 system first described by Young and Davis, supra. Clones containing the entire sequence of laminin are identified using as probe the cDNA insert of the laminin recombinant isolated during immunoassay screening of the recombinant lambda gtll human endothelial cDNA library. Nucleotide sequencing techniques are used to determine the sequence of amino acids encoded by the cDNA fragments. This information may be used to determine the identity of cDNA clones as specific for human laminin by comparison to the amino acid sequence of isolated laminin chains. Alternatively, identification may be confirmed by employing techniques such as Northern blot analysis and hybrid selected translation or by comparison to laminin clones isolated from other species, e.g., mouse and rat. EXAMPLEA. Preparation of Total RNA Total RNA messenger, ribosomal, and transfer was extracted from fresh human umbilical vein endothelial cells essentially as described by Chirgwin, supra, 1979 . Cell pellets were homogenized in 5 volumes of a solution containing 4 M quanidine thiocyanate, 25 mM sodium citrate at pH 7.0, 0.5 N laurylsarcosine, 0.1 M 2 mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 Antifoam A Sigma ChemicalCo., St. Louis, MO . The homogenate was centrifuged at 6,000 rpm in a Sorvall GSA rotor for 15 minutes at 0 10 C. The supernatant fluid was adjusted to pH 5.0 by addition of acetic acid and the PNA precipitated by 0.75 volumes of ethanol at 200C. for two hours.RNA was collected by centrifugation and dissolved in 7.5 M guanidine hydrochloride containing 2 mM sodium citrate and 5 mM dithiothreitol. Following two additional precipitations using 0.5 volumes of ethanol, the residual guanidine hydrochloride was extracted from the precipitate with absolute ethanol. RNA was dissolved in sterile water, insolvable material removed by centrifugation, and the pellets were re extracted with water. The RNA was adjusted to 0.2 M potassium acetate and precipitated by 0 addition of 2.5 volumes of ethanol at 20 C. overnight. B. Preparation of Poly A containing RNA The total RNA precipitate, prepared as described above, was dissolved in 20 mM Hepes buffer pH 7.2 containing 10 mM EDTA and 1 SDS, heated at 65 0C. for 10 0 minutes, then quickly cooled to 25 C. The RNA solution was then diluted with an equal volume of water and NaCl was added to bring the final concentration to 300 mMNaCl. Samples containing up to 240 A260 units of RNA were chromotographed on poly U sepharose using standard procedures. Poly A containing RNA was eluted with 70 formamide containing 1 mM Hepes buffer pH 7.2 , and 2mM DTA. The eluate was adjusted to 0.24 M NaCl and the RNA was precipitated by 2.5 volumes of ethanol at 20 0C. C. Construction of cDNA Clones in Lambda gtll The procedure followed for the enzymatic reaction is shorn in Figure 1. The mRA 20 ug was copied into ds cDNA with reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase I exactly as described by Buell, et al., supra, andWilkensen, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 253 2483 1978 . The ds cDNA was desalted on Sephadex G 50 and the void volume fractions further purified on an Elutip D column, Schleicher Schuell, Gene, Hit , following the manufacturer s directions. The ds cDNA was made blunt ended by incubation with S1 nuclease, Ricca, et al,J. Biol. Chem. 256 10362 1981 .The reaction mixture consisted of 0.2 M sodium acetate pH 4.5 , 0.4 sodium chloride, 2.5 mM zinc acetate and 0.1 unit of S1 nuclease per ng of ds cDNA, made to a final reaction volume of 0 100 ç1. The ds cDA was incubated at 37 C. for one hour, extracted with phenol chloroform, and then desalted on a Sephadex G 50 column as described above. The double stranded cDNA was then treated withEco RI methylase and DNA polymerase I Xlenow using reaction conditions described in Maniatis, MolecularCloning, supra. The cDNA was again desalted on SephadexG 50 as described above and then ligated to 0.5jug of phosphorylated Eco RI linkers using T4 DNA ligase aniatis, supra . The mixture was then cleaved with EcoRI and fractionated on an 8 acrylamide gel in Tris Borate ffer Maniatis, supra . DNA with a size greater than 1 kilobase was eluted from the gel and recovered by binding to an Elutip D column, eluted with 1 M NaCl and then collected by ethanol precipitation. As shown in Figure 2 the DNA fragments were then inserted into Eco RI cleaved and phosphatase treated lambda gut11, using T4 DNA ligase. A library of approximately five hundred thousand recombinant phage was produced. The library was amplified by producing plate stocks at 40C. on E. coli Yi083 supE SupF metB trpR hsdR hsdm tonA21 strAlacUl69 proc Tn5 pMC9 .Amplification procedures are described in Maniatis, supra. Important features of this strain, described byYoung and Davis, include 1 supF required suppression of the phage amber mutation in the S gene , 2 . hsdR hsdM necessary to prevent restriction of foreign DNA prior to host modification, 3 lacU169 a deletion of the lac operon which reduces host phage recombination and which is necessary to distinguish between lambda gt recombinants and non recombinants , and 4 pMC9 a lacI bearing pBR322 derivative which represses, in the absence of an inducer, the expression of foreign genes that may be detrimental to phage and or cell growth .D. Identification of Clones Containing Laminin Sequence To screen the library for laminin antigenic determinant producing clones, 500,000 lambda gtll recombinant phage were plated on a lawn of E. coli Y1090 DlacU169 proA D lon araD139 strA supF trpC22 TnlO pMC9 and incubated at 420C. for 4 hours. This host is deficient in the lon prot ease, thereby reducing the degradation of expressed foreign protein. A nitrocellulose filter, previously saturated with 10 mM isopropyl thio B d galactopyranoside IPTG and dried, was overlaid on the plates. The plates were then incubated at 370C. overnight.Since IPTG is an inducer of lacz transcription, the expression of foreign DNA inserts in lambda gtll is under common control with lacZ transcription, and, as such, is also induced. The position of the filter was marked with a needle, the filter removed, washed in TBS buffer 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mM Nail , and incubated in TBS plus 3 gelatin for 60 minutes at room temperature. The filter was then incubated at room temperature overnight in a 1 100 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against rat laminin in a buffer consisting of 1 gelatin in TBS. After 2 thirty minute washes with TBS at room temperature, 20 ml of a 1 2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase HRP conjugated goat anti rabbit antisera Bio Rad, Richmond, CA was added.The filters were then incubated for 2 hours at room temperature, and then washed 2 times for thirty minutes inTBS. The filters were then incubated at room temperature in HRP color development solution as described in theBio Rad sura accompanying literature. A 4 mm diameter plug at the position of each of the color development signals Fig. 3 was removed from the plates and incubated in 10 mM Tris HC1, pH 7.5, and 10 mM MgSO4 for one hour. Approximately 103 plaqueforming units PFU were replated on 90 mm plates and rescreened as described above. This replating and rescreening process was repeated until all plaques on the plate produced a signal. The cDNA insert from Laml2 was excised using the restricton enzyme Eco RI. The cDNA insert approximately 1.4 Rb in length was subcloned into the Eco RI site of pUC9. Recombinant plasmids are called pMJ5. This construction was used to transform an E.coli host and the resulting transformant was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, MD 20852 on May 9, 1986 in accordance with the provisions of the Budapest treaty. After viability testing, the accession number ATCC 67112 was assigned. The cDNA insert was also subcloned into the Eco RI site of Ml3mpll. The recombinant phage were isolated and subjected to nucleic acid sequence analysis as described by Sanger. Sanger, et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 74 5463 1977 . The sequences obtained at the 5 and 3 ends ofLaml2 are shown in Figures 4 5, respectively at Lines a. Lines b show the amino acid sequence of lamininr which can be deduced from the nucleotide sequence. Lines c show the amino acid sequence deduced from the sequencing of a mouse laminin B chain cDNA, and Lines d show the nucleic acid sequence of the mouse laminin cDNA Barlow, D.P., t l. Green, M. Kurkinen, and B.L.M. Hogan, 1984 EMBOJournal 3 2355 2362 . The data indicate that Laml2 cDNA encodes a COOH terminal portion of the human laminin B1 chain.The amino acid sequences deduced from the human and mouse clones share 92 homology, while the nucleotide sequences share 90S horology. These homologies show thatLaml2 is a cDNA clone of the human laminin B chain, and suggest extreme conservation of this protein in nature. A pharma ceutical or cosmetic preparation containing the laminin of this invention may be prepared according to methods well known in the art for the treatment of epithelial damage or degeneration. The therapeutic preparation which contains the laminin of this invention may be conveniently mixed with a non toxic pharmaceutical organic carrier or a non toxic pharmaceutical inorganic carrier. The pharmaceutical carrier of choice may take the form of a gel or cream. In general, the formulations of this invention utilize only an effective amount of laminin which for pharmaceutical preparations is somewhat higher than for cosmetic preparations. A therapeutically effective amount of laminin may be about 1 to 5 micrograms per milliliter of carrier. Thus, this example describes experimental procedures which provide human laminin essentially free of other proteins of human original from a human tissue extract containing laminin specific mRNA in a heterogeneous mRNA population. It should be appreciated that the present invention is not to be construed as being limited by the illustrative embodiment. It is possible to produce still other embodiments without departing from the inventive concepts herein disclosed. Such embodiments are within the ability of those skilled in the art.
