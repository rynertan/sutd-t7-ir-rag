# SWITCH MATRIX APPARATUS FOR SATELLITE SWITCHED TDMA SYSTEM OR THE LIKE

## Abstract
The switch matrix apparatus may be used, for example, in SS TDMA or FDMA systems in relay stations where a plurality of stations carry on the communications with each other arbit rarily via the relay stations. This switch matrix apparatus 4 comprises M distributing means 201 20M for distributing an input signal applied thereto into N signals wherein M and N are positive integers N combining means 301 30N for com bining the respective distributing outputs of said M distribut ing means 201 20M to a signal, respectively, said N combin ing means 301 30N respectively including a current combin ing means using resistances and a low input impedance cir cuit to be connected to the output of said current combining means and M N switching circuit means 11 to MN con nected respectively between the outputs of said M distribut ing means 201 20M and the inputs of said N combining means 301 30N , said M N switching circuit means 11 to MN respectively having a switch means with a high input impedance and a low output impedance. In this switch matrix apparatus the impedance matching among circuits is easily achieved even if there are long connection distances between the circuits the impedance matching may be unnecessary if the distances are short with small losses caused thereby. Furthermore, the switch matrix apparatus may have high speed, compact, light weight and low power consumption characteristics, and flexibility against the change in the number of the input output signals.
