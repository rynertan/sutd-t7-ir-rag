# Condition indicating device for wheeled shock absorbers.

## Abstract
An accelerometer G is attached on the spring suspension U of the wheel H in question and capable upon passing of the vehicle over road irregularities to emit a decaying A.C. signal S with information on the oscillations of the axle A and the damping of the tyre. After integration in an integrator I the signal is a measure of the difference between the damping of the shock absorber at expansion and at compression. This signal is compared in a comparator K with a reference signal V ref for the permissible damping difference and results in alarm L upon achieving said difference.
