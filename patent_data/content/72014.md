## Description
COMBINATION OF 2 SUBSTITUTED PENEMS WITH DIPEPTIDASEINHIBITORSSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The compounds 2 substituted penems are those having the following structure described as the free acid, but also including easily removable or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester groups EMI1.1 wherein R is R or SR wherein R is alkyl including cycloalkyl of 1 6 carbon atoms, aryl such as phenyl or phenylalkyl having 7 12 carbon atoms, heterocyclyl and heterocyclylalkyl wherein alkyl has 1 3 carbon atoms and the heterocycle has 1 4 hetero atoms selected from 0, N, and S such as l methyl I,2,3,4 tetrazolyl, furyl, thienyl, pyridyl, thiazolyl, and similar examples. Alkyl or aryl as used in these definitions can also include substituted alkyl and substituted aryl, the substituents being alkoxy, alkyl carboxy, and others. These penems as well as others are described by R.B. Woodward in Recent Advances in the Chemistry of p Lactam Antibiotics , J. Elks Ed , The ChemicalSociety, London, 1977, p. 167 R.B. Woodward, Abstracts of Uppsala University 500 Years Symposium on CurrentTopics in Drug Research, Uppsala, Sweden, October 19 21, 1977, Acta. Pharm. Suecica, Vol. 14, Supplement, p. 23, and U.S. Patents 4,070,477, issued 24 January 1978 and 4,260,618, issued 7 April 1981, and in British patent applications 2,013,674 published 15 August 1979 and 2,042,520 published 24 September 1980. All penems within these publications and patents are incorporated within the scope of this invention. The particularly preferred group of penems for use in this invention as those in which R is SR , R being alkyl of 1 6 carbon atoms, especially ethyl, or R is pyridyl or phenyl. These compounds have a high level of antibacterial activity, but are subject to extensive metabolism by mammalian species. The kidney was identified as the primary site of metabolism, and an enzyme was purified from renal extracts which catalyzed the inactivation of thienamycin by hydrolysis of the lactam. By such criteria as cytological localization, substrate specificity and susceptibility to enzyme ihIbitors, this enzyme is very similar if not identical to a widely studied renal dipeptidase E.C.3.4.13.11 , also referred to in the literature as dehydropeptidase I . We have now found that these penems can be combined with a class of chemical compounds which are dipeptidase inhibitors, and which selectively inhibit the metabolism of the dipeptidase E.C.3.4.13.11 . These chemical compounds are Z 2 acylamino 3 monosubstituted propenoates having the following formulaEMI3.1 wherein R2 and R3 are hydrocarbon radicals in the range respectively of 3 10 and 1 15 carbon atoms.In either of these hydrocarbon radicals R2 and R3, up to 6 hydrogens may be replaced by halogens, or a non terminal methylene may be replaced by oxygen or sulfur, including oxidized forms of the latter. A terminal hydrogen in R3 can also be replaced by a hydroxyl or thiol group, which may be acylated, such as with an alkanoyl acid of 1 8 carbon atoms, or carbamoylated, including alkyl and dialkyl carbamate derivatives or the hydrogen can be replaced by an amino group, which may be derivatized as in an acylamino, ureido, amidino, guanidino, or alkyl or substituted alkyl amino group, including quaternary nitrogen groupings or, alternatively, there may be replacement by acid groups such as carboxylic, phosphonic or sulfonic acid groups or esters or amides thereof, as well as cyano or combinations thereof, such as a terminal amino acid grouping. R2 is preferably a branched alkyl or cycloalkyl radical C3 10 with a limitation that the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl cannot be tertiary. R2 cannot be phenyl or straight chain loweralkyl of 1 4 carbon atoms, where R3 is straight chain lower alkyl of 1 4 carbon atoms. R1 is hydrogen, loweralkyl C1 6 or dialkylaminoalkyl e.g., CH2Ch2N C2H5 2, CH2CH CH3 N CH3 2. Some of the compounds with formula II above have asymmetric forms. Racemic Z 2 2,2 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxamido 2 octenoic acid has been resolved. The activity resides in the dextrorotatory isomer, which has the S configuration. Within the definition of R2, the following sub groups are included R4 II A wherein R4 is a straight, branched, or cyclic hydrocarbon radical of 3 10 carbon atoms which may be substituted as specified above in the definition of R2 R5R6 II B wherein R5 is cycloalkyl of 3 6 carbon atoms andR6 is either 1 or 2 alkyl substituents which may be joined to form another ring on the cycloalkyl group, or R5

The Z configuration J.E. Blackwood et al.,J. Am. Chem. Soc., 90, p. 509 1968 is assigned to the above compounds on the basis of their NMR spectra by analogy with the work of A. Srinavasan et al.Tetrahedron Lett., 891 1976 J. Although these compounds of Formula II, when R1 is H, are described and named as the free acids, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives such as alkali and alkaline earth metal, ammonium, or amine salts, or the like can be employed as equivalents thereto. Salts such as the sodium, potassium, calcium, or tetramethylammonium salts are suitable. Some of the compounds of Formula II are novel compounds which are disclosed in European application 79,102,616.4 publication No. 10,573 and in Case 16140IB, U.S. SN 18S,178, filed September 17, lY80, and which do not form part of this invention. As mentioned above, the thienamycin type compound is used in combination with the dipeptidase inhibitor.METHODS OF TESTING AND USING THE INVENTION Disposition studies with thienamycin, its natural analogs and its semi synthetic derivatives have revealed a major metabolic degradation pathway of elimination in the various species examined mouse, rat, dog, chimpanzee, Rhesus monkey . The extent of metabolism is reflected in low urinary recovery and short plasma half lives.The nature of this degradation was demonstrated to be lactam cleavage by the renal dipeptidase E.C.3.4.13.11 , described first by Bergmann, M.and Schleich, H., Z. Physiol. Chem., 205 65 1932 see also Greenstein, J.P., Advances in Enzymology, Vol. VIII, Wiley Interscience, 1948 , New York, and Campbell, B.J. Lin, Y C., Davis, R.V. andBallew, E., The Purification and Properties ofParticulate Renal Dipeptidase , Biochim. Biophys.Acta., 118, 371 1966 . In order to demonstrate the ability of the compounds of Formula II to suppress the action of the renal dipeptidase enzyme, an in vitro screen procedure was followed. This measured the ability of compounds to inhibit hydrolysis of glycyldehydrophenylalanine GDP by a solubilized preparation of dipeptidase isolated from hog kidneys. The procedure is as follows to a 1 ml. system containing 50 mM MOPS 3 N morpholino propanesulfonic acid buffer, pH 7.1, is added 5Wg of lyophilized enzyme, and the test compound at a final concentration ofO.lmM. After a five minute incubation at 370C, GDP is added to a final concentration of 0.05my. Incubation is continued for 10 minutes, at 370C and hydrolysis of GDP is measured by the change in optical density with time at 275 nm. Inhibition of the enzyme is gauged by comparison to a standard run containing no inhibitor and is expressed as the inhibitor binding constant, Si. This is the concentration of the inhibitor which achieves 50 inhibit ion of enzyme. The substrate GDP is employed in preference to thienamycin in this screen because it has a much higher maximal velocity of hydrolysis by renal dipeptidase, thereby reducing the amount of enzyme required. Both GDP and thienamycin have a similar affinity for renal dipeptidase furthermore,Kiwis of inhibitors tested have been identical for the two substrates. In addition to this in vitro screen procedure, an in vivo screen was followed to measure the test compound s ability to inhibit metabolism as reflected by increase in urinary recovery of the penems of formula I from the mouse. The procedure involves co administration of the test compound by the intravenous or subcutaneous route at a dose rate of 10 100 mg kg, with 10 mg kg penem. Penem recovery in the urine over a 4 hour period is then compared with its recovery in a control group to which test compound was not co administered. Urinary recovery of penem was measured in all cases with the use of a cylinder or disc diffusion assay, conducted in a manner described in U.S. Patent 3,950,357. This bioassay, with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 as the test organism, has a useful response range from 0.04 gum to 3.0 g ml. The combination of the inhibitor and the penem can be in the form of a pharmaceutical composition containing the two compounds in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The two can be employed in amounts so that the weight ratio of the penem to inhibitor is 1 3 to 30 1, and preferably 1 1 to 5 1. The components can also be separately administered. For instance, the penem can be administered orally, intra muscularly or intravenously in amounts of 1 100 mg kg day, preferably 1 20 mg kg day, or 1 5 mg kg dose, in divided dosage forms, e.g., three or four times a day. The inhibitor can be separately administered, orally, intramuscularly, or IV, in amounts of 1 100 mg kg day, or preferably 1 30 mg kg day, or 1 5 mg kg dose in divided dosage forms, e.g., three or four times a day. The amounts of the two components administered during one day ideally are within the ratio limits denoted above. One preferred dosage regimen and level is the combination of the compound 2 ethylthio 6 l hydroxy ethyl pen 2 em 3 sodium carboxylate and the crystalline form of 7 L amino 2 carboxyethylthio 2 2,2 dimethyl cyclopropanecarboxamido 2 heptenoic acid, co admini stered in a sterile aqueous IV injection form sodium salt , at a level of 250 or 500 mg of the penem compound and about 1 1 weight of the heptenoic acid, or 2s0 or 500 mg. This dose can be given to humans each assumed to weigh about 80 kg. from 1 to 4 times daily, that is 3.1 25 mg kg day of each drug.Since this penem is orally active, it can also be combined with another inhibitor, Z 2 2,2 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxamido 2 octenoic acid and both administered orally, at dose levels estimated for humans at 2 8 mg kg dose of the penem and 1 8 mg kg dose of the inhibitor, such doses being administered 1 4 times a day. The components, whether administered separately or together are employed in pharmaceutically acceptable carriers such as conventional vehicles adapted for oral adminstration such as capsules, tablets, or liquid solutions or suspensions. The components separately or together, can also be dissolved in a vehicle adapted for administration by injection. Suitable formulations for oral use, may include diluents, granulating agents, preservatives, binders, flavoring agents, and coating agents. The example of an oral use composition in the combination of active ingredients, or the acid component alone, intermixed in the dry pulverulent state with gelatin, starch, magnesium stearate, and alginic acid, and pressed into a tablet. Examples which illustrate this invention follow.SECTION 1. EXAMPLES ILLUSTRATING ACTIVITY EXAMPLE 1In Vitro Test Data A 1 ml. system of 50 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.1, is used. To this is added 5Wg of the pig renal enzyme and an amount of the test compound to bring its final concentration to 0.1 mM. After a five minute incubation at 370C, an amount of GDP is added to bring its final concentration to 0.05 mM.The system is again incubated for 10 minutes, at 370C. Hydrolysis of GDP is measured by its change in optical density with time at 275 nm. Inhibition of the enzyme is gauged by comparison to a standard run containing no inhibitor and is presented as percent inhibition. The K. is a constant indicating the concentration of inhibitor necessary to produce 50 inhibition of enzyme. It is a calculated value obtained from running multiple in vitro assays, as above, at concentrations resulting in inhibition below and above the 50 inhibition point.

EXAMPLES ILLUSTRATING CHEMICAL PREPARATIONS The inhibitor compounds are novel compounds claimed in a copending application. These compounds are made by condensing directly the appropriate 2 keto acid and amide EMI31.1 wherein R2 and R3 are as defined. The general reaction conditions involve mixing approximately 1 4 1 parts of the acid to the amide in an inert solvent such as toluene or methyl isovalerate and heating at reflux with azeotropic removal of water for from 3 48 hours, preferably 5 24 hours. The solution when cooled normally yields the product in crystalline form, but the product can also be isolated using a base extraction process. The product can be recrystallized by using generally known techniques. An optional modification of this procedure requires an additional small amount of p toluenesulfonic acid as catalyst during the reaction. Another route to the novel inhibitor compounds uses an a amino acid, t butyl ester in reaction with an acid chloride EMI31.2 This reaction takes place in the presence of base, such as triethylamine, in a solvent such as methylene chloride. The resulting N acylated product VII is then oxidized by treatment with t butyl hypochlorite followed by addition of sodium methoxide. This yields the 2 methoxy derivative VIII and or its elimination product, the ,ss unsaturated ester IX . Further treatment with anhydrous hydrochloric acid converts either VIII or IX or the mixture of both to the desired alpha ,ss unsaturated free acid II .EMI32.1 Some compounds wherein R3 has a terminal substituent which is an amino, quaternary nitrogen, thiol or carboxyl, derivative can be made most conveniently from an intermediate having a terminal bromine. In this case the intermediate has the structureEMI32.2 wherein n is the number of carbons in the desired hydrocarbon chain e.g., from 3 7 .In order to prepare R3 having a terminal trimethylammonium substituent, the bromo intermedaite is reacted with trimethylamine to yield the amino, the bromo intermediate is reacted with ammonia the guanidino, reaction is with guanidine to prepare the thio derivatives, including 2 amino2 carboxxethylthio, the bromo compound is reacted with cysteine HCl, or the appropriate mercaptan.Derivatized amino, such as formamidino, ureido, and acylamide acetamido can be made from the compounds having an amino group by reacting with o benzyl formimidate HCl, potassium cyanate and the appropriate acyl anhydride acetic anhydride , respectively. Another route for preparing compounds when R3 is a terminally substituted thio derivative utilizes a chloro keto ester intermediate EMI33.1 in reaction with the desired amide,EMI33.2 in toluene at reflux in the presence of a catalytic amount of p toluenesulfonic acid. The resulting intermediate is hydrolyzed to the acid the chloro group is then displaced in reaction with the appropriate mercaptan. This reaction is valuable since it permits use of the chiral amide IV, thereby preparing a functionalized side chain. In addition, the mixture of Z E isomers prepared after the mercaptan condensation can be directly isomerized into the Z form by adding acid to a pH about 3, and heating to about 900C for 30 minutes. Only the Z form remains, and recovery is simple and straight forward. More detail about preparation of the compounds is found in the following examples.

After 15 min., a solution of sodium methoxide prepared by dissolved 0.52 g 22.6 mmole of solution in 35 ml ofMeOH was added. Stirring was continued at ambient temperature under N2 in the dark. After 16.5 hrs., the precipitated NaCl was filtered off. The filtrate was diluted with Et2O and washed successively with 3 x 5Q ml of 0.5 N HC1, 50 ml of saturated Na2CO3 and 2 x 50 ml of H20. The Et2O phase was dried overMgS04 and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated on the rotovac.The pale, golden yellow residual oil 6.45 g was subjected to preparative high pressure liquid chromatography, resulting in the separation and isolation of 273 mg and 496 mg of the two diastereomers of t butyl 2 2,2 dimethylcyclopropane carboxamido 2 methoxyhexanoate respective mp s 114 118 and 124 125.5 as well as l.97 g or a single isomer apparently Z of t butyl 2 2,2dimethylcyclopropanecarboxamido 2 hexenoate chlorless oil .Step D 2 2,2 Dimethylcyclopropanecarboxamido 2hexenoic acid A solution of 0.84 g 3.0 mmole of t butyl 2 2,2 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxamido 2 hexenoate in 10 ml of Et2O saturated with anhydrous HCL was allowed to stand at room temperature under a drying tube.

Note Treatment of the methanol adduct, t butyl 2 2,2 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxamido 2 methoxyhexenOate, with anhydrous HC1 in Et2O under similar conditions gave the same product. EXAMPLE 14 Z 2 2,2 Dimethylcyclopropanecarbonylamino 2octenoic acid, sodium salt The reagents, 2,2 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxamide, 7.0 g. 2 keto octanoic acid ethyl ester, 14.7 g. 50 mg. of p toluene sulfonic acid and 100 ml. of toluene was changed to a 250 ml. three necked flask under a Dean Stark trap containing several molecular sieve pellets. The mixture was refluxed vigorously for 27 hours. The resultant light yellow solution was cooled and concentrated in vacuo, at a water bath temperature of 450C., in the presence of water to help remove toluene. The gummy residue was suspended in 230 ml. of 2N NaOH and stirred at 300C for 3 hours then the temperature was raised to 350C for an additional 2 1 2 hrs.until a clear solution formed. The solution was then cooled, 85 ml. methylene chloride added, and the pH adjusted to 8.5 using 4N HCl with stirring.The organic layer was separated and discarded The aqueous layer 366 ml. was assayed by liquid chromatography to contain 37.2 mg ml 87 Z isomer.Another 85 ml. portion of CH2Cl was en added and pH adjusted to 4.5 with stirring. The organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer reextracted with 50 ml. of CH2Cl2, with the pH again adjusted to 4.5. Combined organic extracts were dried over Na2So4, filtered, and concentrated to a gum. This residue was dissolved in 150 ml. isopropanol and 15 ml. water and the pH adjusted to 8.2 with 2N NaOH. The resulting solution was concentrated to an oily residue which was flushed with isopropanol until it turned to a crystalline solid, indicating that most water had been removed. It was crystallized from 120 ml. of isopropanol, cooled in ice for 1 hour filtered, and washed with 50 ml. cold isopropanol followed by copious amounts of acetone.It was dried at 60 C 0.1 am 2 hours to yield 10.74 g 63.2 crystalline material, having essentially a single peak in liquid chromatography, m.p. 241 2430C. The starting material, 2,2 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxamide is most conveniently prepared by resolution of the D,L acid, followed by reaction with oxalyl chloride and then ammonia to give the resolved amide. One way of making the starting material is as follows 23.1 g. of D,L 2,2 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid was suspended in 33 ml H20 and the pH adjusted to 8.0, using 50 NaOH, about 10 ml.To this was added a solution of 38.4 g quinine in a mixture of 60 ml. methanol and 30 ml. H20 to which had been added about 8 ml of concentrated HCl in another 30 ml. H20 to give a pH of 7.1. This was actually a solution of quinine hydrochloride. These solutions were added all at once, with stirring. The gummy crystalline material which formed was heated to give two clear layers and again stirred vigorously while cooling to give a crystalline product. This product was permitted to stand over two days at room temperature. It was then filtered, washed with 2 x 10 ml water, and 2 x 10 ml 50 methanol, and air dried with suction.The yield of crude quinine salt was 44.8 g 48.7 yield monohydrate, m. p. 113 116 C, having a alpha D20 of 94.30, C 1.0 CHC13. This material was recrystallized from acetone to yield 24.35 g, m.p. 127 1300C. This purified quinine salt was converted to the acid by reaction with aqueous base and chloroform, followed by acid, to yield 96 3.9 g having alpha D20 of 146,0 . This acid was converted to the amide as follows A charge of 30.5 g acid was added over 5 10 minutes through a dropping funnel to chilled 100C oxalyl chloride, 54 ml., containing 1 drop dimethylformamide. This was stirred overnight at ambient temperature. A clear solution was observed, which was added to 100 ml. methylene chloride to dilute.Excess oxalyl chloride was removed by concentrating and the mixture flushed twice with methylene chloride.
