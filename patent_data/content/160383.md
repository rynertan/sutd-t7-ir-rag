# Multiple frequency side lobe interference rejector.

## Abstract
A transceiver, such as a radar transponder, for receiving signals, converting the frequency of the input signals to a digital address and storing a signal representative of the amplitude of the input signal in a bin determined by the address. If the current amplitude exceeds a predetermined relationship with the stored amplitude a response is trans mitted and if the current amplitude exceeds the stored amplitude the current amplitude is stored.
