# Apparatus for picking up and separating bags from a pack to be applied to automatic bag inserting apparatus.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a system for feeding single bags to automatic bag inserting apparatuses, picking them up and also unsticking the bag being picked up from the underlying ones, in case they are glued to one another because of glue drops during the bag manufacture. The system substantially comprises three units a first unit 6 provided with suction cups 12 , picking up the bag at its transversal middle portion, where accidental ad hesion of bags cannot happen, and lifting it to allow that two unsticking units, 7, 8 consisting of bars 22, 22 , 30, 30 being inserted under the bag and unsticking it from the underlying one with a spreading action, are inserted be tween said bag being picked up and the underlying one. One of the two units is also provided with pincers 26, 26 blocking the bag edges on the open unsticking arms 22, 22 and, in the return stroke of the unit to the starting position, transferring it on to the feeding device of the bag inserting apparatus. The other unsticking unit 8 is so arranged that the two unsticking bars, 30, 30 in addition to the spreading action, are lowered so as to press the underlying bags so as to hold them down during the stage of bag picking by said pincers 26, 26 of the first unsticking unit 7 , so that, if the unstick ing was not complete, the underlying bags are kept blocked down and the bag being picked up is stripped and finally separated from the others.
