## Description
DESCRIPTION PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF WATER SOLUBLE POWDERS OR CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS OF CATIONIC DYES The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of cationic dyes in the form of a watersoluble solid or a concentrated solution. The desirable commercial forms of cationic dyes are i water soluble preferably easily wettable solids, preferably easily wettable, non dusting, highly soluble powders or ii stable concentrated solutions preferably aqueous solutions optionally containing organic solvents . There are known a number of processes for producing such commercially desirable forms which depend upon effecting an exchange of the dye anion.It is known that the nature of the dye anion can markedly effect the solubility of the dye, for example the mineral acid salts of cationic dyes are often poorly soluble, whereas the organic acid salts are often highly soluble. Known processes which effect ion exchange may be direct or indirect. For example, direct methods include treatment of a solution of the dye sulphate or chloride in acetic acid with sodium acetate, barium carbonate or lead oxide with subsequent filtration to remove the precipitated metal sulphate or chloride. For example indirect methods involve the precipitation of the dye hydroxide or bicarbonate which may be isolated and reacted with an organic acid to produce a solution of the organic acid salt of the dye. Both these methods involve difficult filtrations, the metal sulphate or chloride separating in finely divided from and the dye hydroxides or bicarbonates often separating as oils or resinous precipitates.When isolated, the dye hydroxides or bicarbonates are relatively unstable, particularly on drying at elevated temperatures and the process fails when applied to alkali sensitive dyes through degradation of the dye cation. We have now discovered an indirect ion exchange process which may be applied with equal facility to alkali insensitive or alkali sensitive dyes, gives highly crystalline easily filterable precipitates which may be dried at elevated temperatues and which react readily with organic acids to produce stable concen trated solutions or, by subsequent evaporation, highly soluble solids e.g. easily wettable powders. According to the present invention therefore there is provided a process for the preparation of a cationic dye in the form of a water soluble solid or a concentrated solution which comprises. a preparing a cyanate of a cationic dye b isolating the dye cyanate c reacting the dye cyanate with an organic acid to produce a solution of the cationic dye salt of the organic acid, and optionally d converting the solution into a solid form. The expression solid form includes all such solid forms e.g. cake form and granulate form but the most preferred solid form is a powder. By the term dye cyanate is meant the salt which comprises a cationic dye cation and a cyanate anion. Any cationic dye may be useable according to the present invention. Examples thereof may be drawn from a variety of chemical classes including dyes of the azo, anthraquinone, methine, azomethine, oxazine and quinophthalone series. The dyes are usually in the form of inorganic salts, are preferably soluble or partly soluble in water or organic aqueous solutions and are typically chlordes, bromides, bisulphates, sulphates, methosulphates, phosphates or metal halide salts. The dye cyanate may conveniently be prepared by reacting an aqueous or organic aqueous solution or suspension of a cationic dye salt with a water soluble Cyanate. The solution or suspension of the cationic dye salt may be prepared from isolated cationic dye salt or may result from the process of preparation of the cationic dye salt. The water soluble cyanates are of the alkali metal or alkaline earth metal series or ammonium cyanate and are preferably ammonium, sodium or potassium cyanate. The reaction of the cationic dye salt with the water soluble cyanate may be carried out in a mixture of water and a water miscible organic solvent, but is preferably carried out in water at a temperature of 0 1000C, preferably 15 800C, at a concentration of cationic dye salt of 2 80 w v, preferably 5 50 . The water soluble cyanate may be added as a solid or an aqueous solution optionally in excess of the stoichiometric amount to complete the precipitation of the cationic dye cyanate which separates directly as a crystalline precipitate or, in some cases separates as an oil which rapidly crystallises. The cationic dye cyanate is readily isolated by filtration and subsequently reacted, either after drying or as a moist filter cake, with an organic acid in the presence of an organic solvent and or water according to the reaction.EMI4.1 where D is the dye cation and A the anion of an organic acid. Preferred organic acids useable according to this invention include mono and polycarboxylic acids, for example, formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, onochloracetic acid, acrylic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, citric acid and lactic acid and sulphonic acids, preferably lower alkyl sulphonic acids, for example methane or ethane sulphonic acid. As examples oforganic solvents there may be mentioned ethanol, isopropanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 2 methoxy ethanol 2 methoxy ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, dimethylacetamide or sulpholane. The reaction occurs with evolution of carbon dioxide, and the formation of the cationic dye salt of the organic acid together with the ammonium salt of the organic acid. The organic acid is chosen so that its ammonium salt is highly soluble in water and does not affect the stability of the dye solution. The reaction is normally carried out at ambient temperature but may be accelerated by heating. The dye solutions so obtained may be converted to water soluble solid form, e.g. powder, by a suitable drying process, for example, by spray drying. The dye in solution or solid form is suitable in particular for use in the dyeing and printing of polyacrylonitrile and acid modified polyesters and polyamides. The invention also provides a dyebath made up using a solid or solution of the invention, a method of dyeing using such a dyebath and the fibres or fabrics so dyed. The dye solutions obtained according to this invention are distinguished by very good storage stability even at high concentrations and low temperatures. The invention is further illustrated by the following examples.EXAMPLE 1. 80 g of the cationic dye of formulaEMI6.1 are stirred in 1000 ml water at 50 60 0C until the dye dissolves. The temperature is adjusted to 30 0C when a solution of 40 g potassium cyanate in 100 mls water is added over 20 30 minutes. The mixture is cooled to 250C with stirring when the separated dye cyanate crystallises. The suspension is filtered off under suction and the cake washed with a solution of 10 g potassium cyanate in 200 mls water, the cake is pulled well down. The moist filter cake is slurred in a mixture of 50 g water and 40 g ethylene glycol and 40 g of acetic acid are added gradually with stirring and stirring is continued until the evolution of carbon dioxide ceases. There is thus obtained a stable concentrated solution of the cationic dye which may be used directly. A liquid of greater tinctorial strength may be obtained by drying the isolated dye cyanate for several hours at 500C.EXAMPLE 2. If 80 g of the cationic dye. of formula A represents a bisulphate anion EMI7.1 are treated in the manner described in Example 1 there is obtained a stable concentrated solution of the dye of above fomula where A represents an acetate ion.EXAMPLE 3. 13.5 g of a dye base of formula EMI8.1 are stirred in 60 ml water at 200C. 1.5 g magnesium oxide are added and 15 mls dimethyl sulphate are added portionwise. The mixture is stirred for several hours until the quaternisation is complete when the temperature is raised to 70 0C for 1 hour. The solution is cooled and diluted to 600 ml with water and the pH adjusted to 6 with magnesium oxide. 10 g of sodium cyanate are added and the precipitated dye of formulaEMI8.2 is filtered off and the moist cake slurried in a mixture of 20 g propylene glycol and 20 g sulpholane. Propionic acid is added portionwise until effervesence ceases. The resulting solution may be further diluted with water to the required strengh. A liquid of greater tinctorial strenqth may be obtained by drying the isolated dye cyanate for several hours at 50 C. EXAMPLE 4. 40 g of a dye of formulaEMI9.1 are stirred in 1000 ml water at 550C when 10 g potassium cyanate are added portionwise. The mixture is filtered and washed with a little potassium cyanate solution. The moist filter cake is added portionwise to 40 g formic acid to yield a clear solution of the dye formate. EXAMPLE 5. If the dye in Example 4 is replaced by a dye of formulaEMI9.2 and the precipitated dye cyanate is slurried in 40 g 2 methoxyethanol and 40 g water and treated with 20 g monochloroacetic acid there is similarly obtained a clear concentrated solution.EXAMPLE 6. 20 g of a dye of formula EMI10.1 are stirred in 1000 ml water at 70 0C when 8 g ammonium cyanate are added gradually. On cooling below 20 0C the initially oily precipitate crystallises and is filtered off. The moist filter cake is treated with 10 g of propionic acid and the mixture warmed to 30 C. When effervesence ceases the solution is evaporated to dryness and the residue ground up to give a dye powder of much greater solubility than the original dye.EXAMPLE 7. 20 g of a dye of formulaEMI10.2 are stirred in 500 mls water at 60 0C until dissolved.10 g of sodium cyanate are added gradually and the mixture cooled to room temperature. The precipitated dye cyanate is filtered off and the moist cake is slurred in a solution of 20 g of ethylene glycol and 20 g water. 10 g acetic acid are added and the mixture warmed gently to 60 0C until effervesence ceases. The solution is cooled and screened to give a clear concentrated dye solution.EXAMPLE 8. Dyebaths are prepared from any one of the dye solutions or powders from Examples 1 to 7 by adding 1 part of the dye solution or powder to 2000 parts of water containing one part of 80 acetic acid and two parts of sodium acetate crystals. 100 parts of polyacrylonitrile yarn are introduced into the dyebath at room temperature and the temperature is raised to 100 C over 1 hour and maintained for two hours. After this time the dyed yarn is cooled, rinsed and dried. The following table gives further examples of cat ionic dyes which may be converted to water soluble powders or concentrated solutions, and used, in accordance with the general methods illustrated in the foregoing Examples.
