# A continuous strip of mutually hinged panels.

## Abstract
A continuous strip 10 of a preferably flexible material for forming a plurality of sequentially arranged panels 12 to 18 , includes a hinge means 19 to 24 between mutually adjacent panels. These hinge means 19 to 24 permit the strip to be folded along one or more of the hinge means, particularly in a manner to enable a selected panel 12 to 18 to face the viewer when the strip 10 is folded to form a bundle or part bundle. According to the invention each hinge means includes a number of bridges or hinge sections 19a to 24b and a number of openings 19a to 24b which are so orientated in relation to one another that when the strip 10 is folded along one or along all of the hinge means, a hinge section or the hinge sections of one hinge means will always co act with an opening or the openings of a selected, other hinge means.
