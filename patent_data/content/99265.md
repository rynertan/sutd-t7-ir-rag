# Demodulator.

## Abstract
A demodulator for demodulating alternating signals modulated by time, or by frequency. The demodulator requires only a single constant current source 36 , a single ramp voltage producing capacitor 34 , and a sample and hold function 39 . The intelligence contained in the mod ulated carrier is transformed into a first pulse train 31 , and a second pulse train 49 is produced in response to the first pulse train. The first pulse train samples and holds the ramp voltage 33 , and the second pulse train immediately resets the ramp voltage circuit 52 following each sampie. The held voltage V
