# Swim fin provided with a self shaping, fluid flow conveying and controlling canal like member.

## Abstract
Swim fin 1 provided with a canal like member 202 2 202 for conveying and controlling the fluid flow produced during each swimming stroke. The fin 1 comprises at least at the central portion of its blade 201 a section 2 which, by dynamical deformation, gives rise to a canal like fluid flow conveying member 202 2 202 on that side of the fin opposed to the side under active stroke. The said canal like member 202 2 202 is inverted as soon as the swimming stroke is reversed, so as to perform its fluid flow conveying action during both swimming strokes.
