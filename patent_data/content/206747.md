## Description
1,4 DIHYDROPYRIDINE DERIVATIVES USEFUL IN THE TREATMENTOF CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS, AND A PROCESS FOR PRODUCINGTHE DERIVATIVES. More specifically, 1,4 dihydropyridine derivatives substituted in the two position are said to be distin guished by a powerful vessel influencing action in US Patent Number 4,188,395 by Bossert, et al.No mention is made of inotropic effect. British Patent Number 2,112,782 discloses various dihydropyridines not teaching the compounds of the present invention but having increased myocardial contractility. None of the above references teaches the combina tion of substituents on a dihydropyridine moiety of the present invention. More particularly, the 1,4 dihydropyridine derivatives of the present inven tion having Formula I or II are distinguished fromBossert, et al, by the differences in the sulfur containing substituent on the dihydropyridine moiety and, therefore, are not taught by Bossert, et al. Dihydropyridine polyesters have been described in the literature as antihypertensive and antianginal agents. For example, British Patent Number 1,389,509 describes 1,4 dihydropyridine polyesters as coronary agents. Further, disclosure for cardiovascular activity used as antihypertensives, vasodilators, antifibrillatory agents, and also having marked smooth muscle effect is made for 1,2,3,4 tetrahydropyridine 3,5 dicarboxylic acid derivatives in WestGerman Application Number 3,239,273A. Other dihydropyridines are shown to be calcium agonists or cardiotonics in Belgian Patent 893,984. Additional disclosure for various dihydropyridine polyesters having usefulness as cardiovascular agents is found inWest German Application 2,248,150 and Belgian Patents 804,160, 803,474, 861,964, 843,576, and 817,540. Thus, the present novel dihydropyridine derivatives of Formula I or Formula II each as defined hereinafter having valuable calcium antagonist and cardiotonic properties useful for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders are not within the teachings of the prior art. Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof wherein R is 1 hydrogen 2 lower alkyl of from one to four carbons, inclusive which is optionally substituted with an amino group such as NR7R8 where tri and R8 are independently hydrogen or lower alkyl, or taken together form a five or six membered ring and 3 aralkyl wherein a ar is phenyl optionally substituted with one or more of halo, nitro, amino, mono or di alkylamino wherein the alkyls when taken together are of from one to six carbons, inclusive, cyano, lower alkoxy of from one to four carbons, inclusive, lower alkyl of from one to four carbons, inclusive, lower thioalkyl of from one to four carbons, inclusive, and b alkyl is alkylene of from one to four carbons, inclusive. R2 and R3 are the same or different and are hydrogen, lower alkyl of from one to four carbons, inclusive, cyano, nitro, R wherein R4 is hydrogenCO24 or lower alkyl of from one to four carbons, inclusive, optionally substituted with amino, mono or dialkylamino wherein the alkyls when taken together are of from one to six carbons, inclusive. R1, R5, and R6 are the same or different and are 1 lower alkyl of from one to four carbons, inclusive, which is optionally substituted with a an amino group, such as N bN where b and R8 are independently hydrogen and lower alkyl which may also be taken together to form a five or sixmembered ring or b ON where R9 is H or lower alkyl of from one to four carbons, inclusive, or c CO2R4, where R4 has same definition as stated above 2 cycloalkyl of from four to seven carbons 3 phenyl optionally substituted with one or more of alkyl of from one to four carbons, inclusive, halo, nitro, amino, mono or di alkylamino wherein the alkyls when taken together are of from one to six carbons, inclusive, cyano, lower alkoxy of from one to four carbons, inclusive, lower thioalkyl of from one to four carbons, inclusive 4 alkyl wherein ar is phenyl optionally substituted with one or more of alkyl of from one to four carbons, inclusive, halo, nitro, amino, mono or di alkylamino wherein the alkyls when together have of from one to six carbons, inclusive, cyano, lower alkoxy of from one to four carbons, inclusive, lower thioalkyl of from one to four carbons, inclusive or 5 heteroaryls. Additionally, h and R5 may also be taken together to form a five or six membered ring having as a member of the ring a C O or C O O group. n is a number of from zero to two, inclusive m is a number of from one to six, inclusive and with the proviso that when n is 0 then R1 cannot be lower alkyl or cycloalkyl. Additionally, the present invention is a compound of the Formula II and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof where possible, e.g., when a basic nitrogen is present, wherein n, R, R1, R2 R3, R5, and R6 are as defined above but where n is 0, then R1 can also be lower alkyl of from one to four carbons, inclusive, and cycloalkyl. The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I or II as each is defined above with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A therapeutically effective amount comprises a therapeutic cardiovascular effective amount. The compounds of this invention are useful in a method of treating cardiovascular disorders in a mammal, including man, suffering therefrom,which method rrnpri6es administering to such mammals a therapeutically effective amsunt of a compound of Formula I or a compound of Formula II. The preferred compounds of the present invention are 1 the compounds of Formula I and II whereinR2 is CN and n is one or two 2 the compounds of Formula I and II wherein R2 and R5 may also be taken together to form a five or six membered ring having as a member of the ring a C O or sC O O group and n is one or two. The preferred compounds provide increased myocardial contractility giving the compounds greater value as cardiotonic agents for treatment of cardiovascular disorders. These compounds demonstrate only positive inotropic activity in in vitro tests which activity is associated with increased myocardial contractility PCSI . That is, these compounds do not demonstrate undesirable negative inotropic activity usually associated with these types of compounds. The most preferred compounds of the present invention are the compounds of Formula I whereinR2 is CN, R5 is lower alkyl, R3 is CO2R4, m is one, n is one or two, R4 is same as defined above and R1 is phenyl or heteroaryl as defined herein. Also included in the invention are methods using novel compounds of the present invention wherein n is zero having the disclosed utility recited herein as intermediates for the preparation of the 1,4dihydropyridine derivatives of the invention therefrom having sulfinyl or sulfonyl moieties. The salts of the compounds of Formula I orFormula II possible when a basic nitrogen is present, are prepared in a manner which is in itself known by reacting the compounds obtained according to the processes of the invention with suitable acids.For example, the appropriate compounds of FormulaI or II are dissolved in ethanol, then suitable acids are added to the solution. Examples of inorganic and organic acids which form physiologically acceptable acid addition salts with the dihydropyridines of the present invention are hydrogen halide acids, such as hydrochlqric acid and hydrobromic acid, particularly hydrochloric, phosphoric, sulfuric, nitric, monofunctional and bifunctional carboxylic acids and hydroxycarboxylic acids, such as acetic, maleic, succinic, fumaric, tartaric, citric, salicylic, lactic, and l,5 naphthalenedicarboxylic and naphthalenedicarboxylic and naphthalenedisulphonic acids. Lower alkyl or alkyl of from one to four carbons, inclusive, is meant to include a straight or branched chain alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, and isomers thereof. Halogen or halo means fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or trifluoromethyl. Lower alkoxy and lower thioalkyl of from one to four carbons, inclusive is also meant to include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, and isomers thereof. Mono or di alkylamino is meant to include methylamino, dimetbylamino, ethylamino, N methylN ethylamino, propylamino, diisopropylamino, butylamino, N ethyl N ethylamino, N butyl N ethylamino and the like. A heteroaryl means thienyl, furanyl, pyryl, pyridinyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, pyrimidyl, pyridazinyl, quinazolyl, quinoxalyl, benzothienyl, pyrazolyl, imidazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, triazolyl, pyrazinyl, oxazinyl, thiazinyl, indolizinyl, indolyl, benzofuranyl, indazolyl, benzothienyl, benzimidazolyl, benzoxazolyl, benzioxazolyl, benzthiazolyl, benztriazolyl, benzoxadiazolyl, cinnolinyl, phthalaxinyl, naphthyridinyl, or benzothiazinyl. Alkylene of from one to four carbons, inclusive, are methylene, ethylene, propylene, butylene, or isomers thereof. The compounds of Formula I are useful as salts derived from physiologically acceptable acidsThe acids may be mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and the like, or organic acids, such as ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, and the like giving the hydrochloride, sulfamate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p toluenesulfonate, and the like, respectively. The compound of Formula I and II of the present invention wherein at least R2 and R3 are not just the same as each other, includes stereoisomers due to the presence of at least one asymmetric carbon atom at the four position of the 1,4 dihydropyridine nucleus and can exist as each opticÅal isomer or a racemic mixture. Further, some of the compounds of Formula I and II which have not less than two asymmetric carbon atoms in its molecule may exist as each diastereomer s or the mixture thereof.The mixture of the diastereomers can be resolved to each racemic compound by conventional resolution methods such as chromatography or fractional recrystallization and the like and the racemic compound can be resolved into each optical isomer by a conventional method for racemic resoaution by fractional recrystallization of a salt of the racemic compound with an optically active acid, e.g., tartaric acid or camphor sulfonic acid. The terms wstereoisomersw and a stereoisomerismw as used throughout this specification and the appended claims are to be given the meaning usually ascribed to them by practitioners of the organic chemical arts, and specifically as defined by Eliel ip. Stereo chemistry of Carbon Compounds, pp 1 6, McGraw Hill, New York, 1962. Generally, the compounds of Formula I and FormulaII wherein n is one or two may be conveniently synthesized by oxidation of the compounds of Formula I and Formula II wherein n is 0, respectively. Such oxidation is accomplished in a manner analogous to those known in the art. See, for example, wOxida tion of Sulfides to Sulfoxides and Sulfonesw inAdvanced Organic Chemistry, Ed. Jerry, March, p.1089, 3rd Edition, John Wiley Sons 1985 . SeeScheme I. The compounds of Formula I and II wherein n is zero are generally prepared by the following procedures. A compound having the Formula III wherein R2 and Rg are as defined above, a compound of the Formula IV wherein R6 is as defined above and a compound of Formula V wherein R1 and R3 are as defined above is contacted in the presence of an inert organic solvent such as ethanol, 1 butanol, or dioxane under reflux condition. The products of the reaction are a mixture of the compounds of Formula 10 and IIo. Such products are recovered and or separated by conventional means such as extraction, distillation, chromatography, and the like. See Scheme II. The compounds of Formula 10 and 11o may optionally be reacted with a compound of Formula RX whereinR is as defined above and X is halogen by conventional methods to further obtain the compounds having a definition of R other than hydrogen. See SchemeIII The desired compound of Formula I or FormulaII is isolated and purified by conventional methods. Such isolation and purification do not neceqsÅatate any methods not within the skill of the ordinary artisan. Representative novel compounds of Formula I and of Formula II are found to possess inotropic and vasodilatory activity in vitro and as such, these are useful for the treatment of congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, myocardial ischemia, angina, and hypertension. These are, thus, the cardiovascular disorders noted above to be within the meaning of the present invention. Representative compounds of Formula I and II inhibit niterendipine a reference calcium antagonist binding with an IC50 of 1 x 10 6N to 1 x 10 9M range.These data predict calcium modulator activity beneficial for the utility of the present invention. It is now additionally found that some of the above named preferred compounds advantageously demonstrate positive inotropic effect in vitro. For the preferred compounds of the present invention as defined above, the compounds also produce effects that include increases in contractility and decreases in vascular resistance, with only moderate increases in heart rate in anesthetized dogs. These effects are further complemented by a direct stimulatory effect on the myocardium ire., a positive inotropic effect . The complementary effects are observed in isolated atrial tissue and the effects are not subject to negative inotropic effect. Thus, compounds having the combined activity may provide support to a failing heart without offsetting negative effects usually associated with previously known calcium blocking agents. Additionally, the compounds of the present invention generally exhibit an advantageous vasodilatory effect resulting in the after load reduction associated with calcium antagonists. Test for In Vitro Myocardial Inotropic Activity in Isolated Guinea Pig Atria Adult male guinea pigs weighing 300 400 g are reserpinized 12000 units i.p. and, after ten minutes, are killed by cervical dislocation. The hearts are quickly removed and placed in a physiological salt solution PSS containing 118 mM NaCl, 4.8 mM KC1, 2.4 mM CaCl, 1.2 mM Mug604, 1.0 mM NaH2PO4, 11.1 in dextrose, and 27.2 mM NaHCO3, maintained at pH 7.4 and 3O0C. After removing all superficial blood, the hearts are perfused via the aorta to remove any blood from the coronary arteries.After five to ten minutes of perfusion, the left atria are dissected and mounted vertically in a 50 ml, water jacketed bather containing PSS at 300C and continuously oxygenated with 95 02 5 CO2. The left atria are electrically stimulated at 1.5 Hz.The tissues are equilibrated for 30 minutes and washed with fresh PSS. The stimulation voltage is adjusted to 20 above the threshold and tension adjusted to Lmax the muscle length at which tension development is maximal . The tissues are then equilibrated for an additional 30 minutes, after which the compounds to be examined are added to the tissue bather. The compounds are initially dissolved inDMSO and dilutions made with normal saline, such that the final concentration of DMSO does not exceed 0.5 . The compounds are added in full or half log concentration increments, usually over a concentration range of 1 x 1018 to 1 x 10 4M. The muscles are generally allowed to assume a new steady state contractile response before each subsequent additiqn.of drug. Using this procedure the inotropic activity of preferred compounds of the present invention is shown as found in the following Table 1. The reference calcium antagonist has also been tested for comparison.

A physician or veterinarian of ordinary skill readily determines a subject exhibiting symptoms of the diseases.The routes of administration and the dosage forms therefor are from among those conventional to the pharmaceutical art. Regardless of the route of administration selected the invention provides a compound of Formula I, in unit dosage form comprising the compound either alone or in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier appropriately selected from those known. An effective but nontoxic quantity of the compoundI is employed in treatment. The dosage regimen is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including the type, age, weight, sex, and medical condition of the mammal, the severity of symptoms of the disease being treated, the route of administration and particular compound of Formula I employed.An ordinarily skilled physician or veterinarian will readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the compound I to prevent or arrest the progress of the disease condition. In so proceeding, the physician or veterinarian could employ relatively low dosages at first, subsequently increasing the dose until a maximum response is obtained. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired. It is understood that the compositions and methods of treatment of the present invention as described above also include the pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of Formula I and Formula IIx The following Examples further merely illustrate the invention and, therefore, are not meant to be limiting.EXAMPLE 1A Ethyl S coano 1.4 dihodro 6 methYl 2 phenslthiol methyl 4 2 trifluoromethylphenyl 3 pyridinecarboxylate A solution of 2 trifluoromethyl benzaldehyde 3.48 g, 0.02 mole , 3 aminocrotononitrile 1.6 g, 0.02 mole and ethyl 3 oxo 4 phenylthio butanoate 4.76 g, 0.02 mole in ethanol 50 ml is refluxed for 24 hours.
