# Sausage casing automatic closing machine.

## Abstract
A system for automatically closing one end of a shirred casing strand. A strand is to be automatically presented to an associated closer mechanism 46 in alignment therewith and under a preselected pressure. A transfer device 44 is pro vided for receiving a doffed strand 40 , transferring the strand transversely and then moving the strand longitudinally so that an end of the strand engages the closer 46 . A gripping mech anism is provided which includes a pair of jaws 98 having op posing clamp elements 102 of a generally V shape or angled cross section. The two jaws are simultaneously movable either together or apart and are urged apart by compression springs 104 . A fluid cylinder actuated linkage urges the jaws towards closed positions. By varying the closing force, the clamp mem bers 90 can be first moved to a pre set spacing providing a receptacle into which a doffed strand of a predetermined size may be readily slid. Then by increasing the pressure of the cyl inder, the strand may be sufficiently tightly gripped to prevent relative movement during the closing operation. The closer members are separated to release a closed strand at the end of the closing operation. By varying the pressure to the cylin der in the receptacle forming stage of the clamping members, the size of the receptacle may be adjusted in accordance with variations in size of casing strands to be handled. A control system for the automatic operation of the transfer device in conjunction with the closing device is provided.
