# Fused 1,2,4 oxadiazolylidenebenzenesulfonamides and their use as herbicides and plant growth regulants.

## Abstract
Compounds of the formula CHEM wherein R is halogen, nitro or various organic groups R1 is hydrogen, halogen, nitro or various organic groups X is CH3, C2H5, CH3O or C2H5O Y is H, Cl, CF3, alkyl, alkoxy or alkoxy alkyl and Z is CH or N and their agriculturally suitable salts, exhibit general and selective herbicidal activity and can be useful in regulating plant growth. The compounds can be made e.g. by reacting compounds of formula CHEM with N oxides of formula CHEM or by reacting novel oxadiazoles of formula CHEM with an appropriately substituted phenylsulfonyl chloride of formula CHEM
