# METHOD OF AMPLIFYING HEAT.

## Abstract
Heat being dissipated by a first heating medium in a heat source circulating circuit E is absorbed through an evapor ator 101 , and a second heating medium which is circulating in a heat pump circuit D and which is compressed and raised in temperature by a compressor 102 , has its dissipation regulated in a condenser 103 . As a result, the heating medium circulating from the condenser to the evaporator is maintained at a set temperature which is comparatively high. Heat being dissipated by the condenser 103 is absorbed by a circulation path F for heat utilization through which a third heating medium circulates. The heat thus obtained is partially supplied to the heating medium of the circuit E via heat supplying circuit G . This improves the efficiency of the compressor to provide a large quantity of heat at a high temperature on the heat utility side. When the atmospheric temperature drops, the heating medium in the heat source circulating circuit is heated by a heater 123 as required.
