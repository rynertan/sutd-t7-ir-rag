# ROM PROTECTION SCHEME

## Abstract
In order to protect, from unauthorised copying, computer code placed in internal circuitry in a computer, an encoding Exclusive OR gate 23 is provided in the computer for each data transmission lead 8 from the respective circuitry. One input lead of each encoding Exclusive OR gate is connected to the corresponding incoming data transmission lead 7 in order to receive data to be transmitted on accessible data lines. The other input lead of each encoding Exclusive OR gate is connected via a code matrix 22 to a source 11 of a random M bit binary number. The output signal provided by each Exclusive OR gate 23 is the encoded data bit which is applied to one of the accessible data lines 8 . The encoded data is decoded by a circuit similar to the encoding circuit. In the decoding circuit a decoding Exclusive OR gate 33 is provided for each data transmission lead 9 . One input lead of each decoding Exclusive OR gate 33 is connected to an incoming encoded data transmission lead 8 . The other input ead to the decoding Exclusive OR gate 33 is connected via a code matrix 32 which is similar to the code matrix 22 provided in the encoding circuit, to a source II of a random M bit binary number, where the M bit binary number is the same M bit binary number provided in the encoding circuit. The output leads of the decoding Exclusive OR gates 9 are the transmission lines which carry the decoded data. The encoding matrix 22, 32 and the random M bit word are the same in the encoding and decoding circuit, so the data on the output leads of the Exclusive OR gates is properly de coded. However, the data on bus lines running between in tegrated circuits, and which therefore may be intercepted through the use of logic probes, is in encoded form, thereby substantially increasing the effort required to illicitly deter mine the data stored.
