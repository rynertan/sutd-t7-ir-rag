# Piperazine derivatives and processes for producing them.

## Abstract
Novel piperazine derivatives represented by the following formula CHEM wherein R1 is an indolyl group which may optionally be substituted by one or more lower alkyl and or lower alkoxy groups, a naphthyl group which may optionally be partially saturated with 2 or 4 hydrogen atoms, or a phenyl or cyclohexyl group which may optionally be substituted by one or more lower alkyl groups A is a single bond or an alkylene group P is a single bond or a vinylene group Q is an O alkylene group or an NH alkylene group when P is a single bond, or a single bond when P is a vinylene group and R2 is a lower alkyl, morpholino lower alkyl, morpholinocarbonyl lower alkyl, piperidinocarbonyl lower alkyl, piperazinocarbonyl lower alkyl or lower alkylaminocarbonyl lower alkyl group, and acid addition salts thereof are described, which are proteolytic enzyme inhibitors. Processes for preparing the novel derivatives are described.
