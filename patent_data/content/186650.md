# PREPARATION OF ALKYL SUCCINIC ANHYDRIDE PRECURSORS

## Abstract
A process for producing alkenyl succinic anhydrides by the reaction of an olefin with maleic anhydride in the presence of alkyl succinic anhydride is provided. The alkenyl succinic anhydrides are valuable precursors for the prepara tion of alkyl succinic anhydrides.
