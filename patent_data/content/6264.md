# Composite nonwoven fabric for surgical uses.

## Abstract
A composite nonwoven fabric 1 for use in dispos able surgical items such as surgical gowns, surgical drapes and the like, comprising at least two melt blown hydrophobic plies of microfine fibers 2, 3 of a fiber diameter of up to about 10 microns and at least one non woven cover ply 4 . The nonwoven cover ply may be an apertured film, a spunbonded ply or an air laid, wet laid or carded ply of fibers preferably of staple length or longer and, of particular importance to surgical items, should be characterized by surface stability. When a single cover ply is employed, the exposed melt blown ply should be surface stabilized to improve its resistance to abrasion and pilling. When additional strength is required, the fabric may include a strength ply of hydrophobic spunbonded, air laid, wet laid or carded fibers.
