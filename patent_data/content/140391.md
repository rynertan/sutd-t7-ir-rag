# Rotor head assembly.

## Abstract
A rotor head assembly 40 for a laboratory centrifuge 10 comprising an annular support member 46 and a plurality of centrifuge tube carriers 50 pivotally suspended from said support member at circumferentially spaced points about the periphery thereof each of said tube carriers having an open topped cavity defined by upstanding side walls said side walls including a pair of substantially planar outer side walls 50b meeting along a line which lies in the plane of pivotal movement of such carrier and which extends along the outermost limits of said cavity said pair of planar outer walls meeting each other at an included angle within the general range of 70 DEG to 170 DEG for contacting a centrifuge tube 57 disposed within said cavity along a pair of spaced parallel lines 63 .
