# Single transistor, single capacitor MOS random access memory.

## Abstract
In a memory cell array of the kind including a memory cell capacitor and a memory cell transistor connected in series between a field plate line and a bit line, both the field plate line and bit line are precharged to the same potential level. The field plate line is connected to one input of a sense amplifier and the bit line is connected to the other input. The charge and discharge of the memory cell capacitor causes equal and opposite voltage changes on the field plate line and bit line. With respect to prior art the cell signal is increased by the amount of signal on the field plate line and when sensed against a reference signal which is about one half the amount of the cell signal, the sensed signal is about twice that obtainable in the prior art.
