## Description
The present invention relates to an adjustable chair, and particularly to an anatomic chair structure which can be adjusted to a plurality of different positions. There are currently available on the market various types of adjustable chairs which are particularly designed for office use. One of the most popular structures for an office chair comprises a base which supports a seat and a seat back. Both the seat and the seat back may be provided with independent means for their positional adjustment to suit individual users. This type of chair structure has substantial disadvantages in that the use of separate mechanisms for the positioning of the seat back and for the positioning of the seat significantly increase the manufacturing costs because of the complexity of the structure. Moreover, in use, such known chair structures have disadvantages due to the fact that, by providing separate actuating mechanisms for the two different adjustments it is difficult to synchronise their movement in relation to the movement of the human body. In particular, it is not always possible to have an adiequate adaptation of the inclination of the seat back, with consequent lack of convenience for the utiliser. The GB A 1549041 reference discloses an adjustable chair structure comprising a support frame carried on a base and having a substantially L shaped configuration with a substantially horizontal arm for the support of the seat part of a seat body, and an upright arm for the support of a seat back part of the seat body, said horizontal arm being slidably carried on the base and connected at the rear of the seat back part of the seat body, which is slidably guided on the upright arm such that adjustment of the position of the seat body causes a corresponding adjustment in the position of the seat back part of the seat body. The present invention seeks therefore to overcome the above noted disadvantages by providing an adjustable chair structure which is adjustable in such a way that simultaneous adjustment of the position of the seat and of the seat back can be obtained without needing the actuation of mechanisms which are difficult for the utiliser to gain access to. A particular feature of the invention is that a chair structure formed in accordance with the invention offers the possibility of obtaining the whole of a wide range of positions with an automatic adjustment of the seat back to correspond to different selected positions of the seat. This substantially improves the convenience of use and the comfort of the chair. According to the present invention, the above aim is achieved by an adjustable chair structure having the features of the characterizing part of the main claim. A particular advantage of the present invention is that it provides an adjustable chair structure which, because of its particular constructional characteristics is able to offer the widest guarantees of reliability, comfort and security in use. Another advantage of the present invention is that it provides a chair structure which, as well as having significantly improved performance over chairs of the same general type known from the prior art, has a very much simplified structure and is such as to facilitate manufacture and assembly thereof. One embodiment of the present invention will now be more particularly described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring now to the drawings, the multiple position chair structure of the invention, which is indicated generally with the reference numeral 1 comprises a support frame 2 of substantially L shape conformation which is supported by a base 3. The base 3, in this preferred embodiment has a plurality of radially extending feet 4 provided with castors 5. The feet 4 support a vertical stem 6 to which the support frame 2 is connected. The support frame 2, which, as indicated above, has an L shape conformation, comprises a horizontal arm 7 and an upright arm 8. The upright arm 8 may be vertical or inclined at a small angle to the vertical and is provided for the support of the seat back whilst the horizontal arm 7 provides support for the seat. Although referred to hereinafter as a horizontal arm, the arm 7 may in fact be inclined at a small angle to the horizontal. To the said support frame 2 there is connected a composite body, generally indicated with the reference numeral 10, which comprises a seat 11 which, by means of a flexible projection 12, is connected to a seat back generally indicated 13. In more detail, as can be seen in Figures from 3 to 5, the seat 11 has longitudinal ribs 20 in its underside which constitute guide and slide elements for coupling with corresponding recesses 21 formed on the said horizontal arm 7 of the support frame 2. In this way the seat 11 is slidable with respect to the horizontal arm 7 so as to be able to assume the whole of a wide range of positions selectable by the utiliser. Parallel to the ribs 20 and outwardly of these there are provided two parallel flanges 22 having an L shape in transverse section which flanges couple with the lateral edges 23 of the horizontal arm 7 in such a way as to form an interconnection between the seat 11 and the horizontal arm 7. From the middle of the rear portion of the seat 11 there extends a flexible projection 12 which, on its rear face, that is to say on the face which is not in view during use, there are provided a plurality of spaced notches 30 which allow an adjustable connection to be effected with the said seat back 13 as will be described in more detail below. More specifically, the seat back 13 has a carrier portion, generally indicated 40, which is coupled to the notches 30 of the flexible projection 12 and which is slidably supported by the upright arm 8 in a manner which will be explained with reference to Figures 6 and 7. The upright arm 8 of the support frame 2 has central longitudinal ribs 41 which engage in longitudinal recesses 42 in the carrier 40, and two lateral flanges 43 which function as retainers. The main body of the seat back, indicated 12 With this coupling as described above, when sliding of the seat with respect to the horizontal arm 7 is effected, there is contemporaneously and automatically a corresponding and analogous displacement of the seat back which is linked to the seat itself by means of the connection made by the flexible projection 12 which follows the conformation of the supporting frame 2 and which, in practice, serves as displacement transmission means between the seat and the seat back. In this way there is always an extremely comfortable positioning of the seat in that any forward displacement of the seat causes a corresponding lowering of the seat back, therefore allowing the utiliser to assume a more extended position, whilst if the seat is adjusted rearwardly a corresponding raising of the seat back occurs therefore assuming a more erect sitting position for the trunk of the user. Moreover, there is no fixed rotational position of the body 13 The chair of the present invention can thus assume a very wide range of positions without requiring a complex adjustment mechanism. Indeed, simply by exploiting the slidable coupling between the chair body parts and the support frame therefor it is possible to provide a chair with the advantage of having the seat back and the seat mutually interconnected by means which allow the mutual positioning between the seat and the seat back to be predetermined whilst the sitting position of a user is nevertheless adjustable over a very wide range.
