## Description
PCLYCXA2CLIDCNE POWDER CCRTING COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to thermosetting powder coating compositions which have desirable handling characteristics and which provide substrate coatings having a well balanced conibination of practical physical properties. Powder coating compositions powder paints have long been known as pollution free, energy saving, resource saving and labour saving products. Thermosetting powder coating compositions must have glass transition temperatures high enough to prevent individual particles in such compositions from sintering or fusing during transportation and storage. The resins employed in such powder coating capositions also must have a melt viscosity low enough to permit formation of a smooth continuous film with good adhesion to the substrate being coated.Furthermore, coatings formed from such compositions must have acceptable physical properties such as toughness and impact resistance and must possess high beat and chemical resistance. Law molecular weight epoxy resins have traditionally been employed in thermosetting powder coating compositions. Such epoxy resins can possess the required glass transition teEperature, melt viscosity and coating forming characteristics for use in products of this type. There is, however, a continuing need to develop additional types of powder coating copoositions formulated frcm particular epoxidecontaining resins materials which also have desirably high glass transition temperatures and melt viscosities and which form coatings of improved adhesion to substrates to be coated. The present invention provides thermosetting polymer powder coating compositions in the form of particles having a size of up to 300 microns, comEDrising A an epoxy terminated polyoxazolidone resin which is the reaction product of a diepcxide and a aiisocyanate in which the ratio of epoxide equivalents to isocyanate equivalents provided by the diepoxide and diisocyanate reactants is from 10 1 to 1.1 1, the polyoxazolidone resin having an epoxy equivalent weight from 250 to 4000 and B a curing agent for the epoxy terminated polyoxazolidone resin. Although coating compositions comprising epoxy te minated polyoxazolidone resins have previously been described, for example inU.S. Patents 3,334,110 and 4,066,628, coatings derived from such compositions have been applied only from solution. Epoxy terminated polyoxazolidone resins which are utilized in the Powder coating compositions of the invention are prepared by reacting a diepoxide with a diisocyanate under such conditions that low molecular weight1 epoxy terminated polyoxazolidone resins are produced. The diepoxide which can be used in such a procedure can be one or more diglycidyl ethers having the general formulaEMI2.1 in which R is an aromatic, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or heterocyclic group. Preferred diepoxides are the diglycidyl ethers of non fused polynuclear phenols such as those based on 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propene, i.e. bisphenol A.Examples of such epoxides are those available commercially under the trade names EPoN 828, EPICS 825 and DER 331. Other suitable diepcxides include the diglycidyl ethers of polyglycols such as DER 736, the diglycidyl ethers of hydrogenated bisphenol A, such as DRH 151, and the heterocyclic, i.e. bydantoinbased, epoxies. These and other suitable epoxides are fully described in U.S. Patent 4,066,628. Such epoxides are reacted with diisocyanates of the general formula R NCO 2 in which R is alkylene, substituted alkylene, arylene Cr substituted arylene, to form the polyoxazolidone resin components of the compositions of the invention. Examples of suitable diisocyanates include tolylene diisocyanates TDI slach as 2,4 tolylene diisocyanate, and 2,6 tolylene diisocyanate the methylene bis phenyl isocyanates MDI such as 4,4 methylene bis phenylisocyanate and dianisidine diisocyanate, toluidine diisocyanate, m xylylene diisocyanate, 1. 5 naphthyl ene diisocyanate, p phenylene dii socanate, I, Lbdi ethylbenzene beta, beta di isocyanate, hexamethylene dii socyanat e HMDI , isophorone diisocyanate IPDI and 4,4 methylene bis cyclohexylisocyanate . Mixtures of any two or more of such isocyanates can also be used, for example mixtures of the 2,4 and 2,6 isomers of tolylene diisocyanate and mixtures of the 2,4 and 4,4 isomer of methylene bis phenyl isocyanate . Preferred diisocyanates are the tolylene diisocyanates TDI , the methylene fbis Fhenyl isocyanates MDI and bexamethylene diisocyanates HMDI . Other suitable diisocyanates are described more fully in U.S. Patents 4,066,628 and 3,313,747. These diepoxides and diisocyanates are reacted under conditions which serve to produce an epoxy terminated, polyoxazolidone of the formula EMI3.1 in which R and R are derived from the diepoxide and diisocyanate, respectively, and have the meanings given above. Production of epcxy terminated, low molecular weight polyoxazolidones suitable for formulation into the powder coating compositions of the invention is dependent upon utilization of amounts of diepozide and diisocyanate reactants which provide a ratio of epoxide equivalents to isocyanate equivalents from 10 1 to 1.1 1. More preferably, the ratio of epoxide equivalents to isocyanate equivalents is from 5 1 to 1.2 1.The molecular weight of the resulting polyoxazolidone will generally be relatively low, providing resins which have an epoxy Equivalent weight from 250 to 4000, more preferably from 400 to 1000. The reaction conditions used to prepare the pDlyoxazolidone resins from the particular amounts of diepoxides and diisocyanates include the utilization of a confensation tyoe catalyst. Such catalyst materials are those conventionally employed for reactions of this type and include quaternary ammonium halides, lithium halides, tertiary amines, lithium halide phosphonium oxide complexes, n butoxy lithium, dialkyl zinc, organozinc chelate compounds, trialkyl aluminum and dibutyltin dilaurate. Quaternary ammonium halides, such as tetraethylamnium bromide, and tertiary amines are the preferred catalysts for polyoxazol idone production. The catalyst is advantageously employed in an amount from 0.018 to 1 , more preferably from 0.05 to 0.2E, based on the weight of the diepozide and diisocyanate. Reaction conditions for polyozolidone production may include the use of a solvent such as a lower alkaml or dimethylformamide although the use of a solvent is not essential , a reaction temperature from 70 C to 200 C and a reaction period from 0.01 to 6 hours. More preferably, the polyozolidones are prepared by reacting the diepoxide and diisocyanate at a temperature from 100 C to 1800C for a period fran 1 to 3 hours. The resulting polyoxazolidone polymers can be formulated along with conventional adjuncts into powder coating compositions. In this respect, the polyoxazolidones have physical and chemical characteristics which render them suitable for formulation into powder compositions. Fbr example, such polyoxazolidone resins exhibit desirably higher glass transition temperatures with acceptably low melt viscosities in comparison with conventional bisphenol A diglycidyl ether epoxy resins. Coatings formed fran powder compositions containing such polyoxazolidones also exhibit improved cathodic disbonient resistance in comparison with coatings formed from conventional epoxy resin based powder compositions.The polyoxazoli done resins advantageously comprise from 70 to 99 by weight of such powder coating compositions. In formulating powder coating compositions according to the invention, the pDlyoxazolidone resin can be combined with conventional coating composition components such as curing agents, pigments and flow control agents. such coating compositions can also contain additional resin materials ccapatible with the polyceazolidone resins, for example canventional mono , di and polyeFcside materials described in more detail below. Curing agents, whether of the coreactive. cross linking, catalytic or accelerator type, serve to enhance the cure of coatings prepared from the coating compositions of the invention and can include any of the wide variety of materials knawn to be useful for this purpose in epoxy resin b2sed coating compositions. Such materials include, for example, polyamines, polyamides, polyaminoamides, polyphenols, polymeric thiols, polycarboxylic acids and anhydrides, polyols, imidazoles, tertiary amines and quaternary ammonium halides.such curing agents are described in greater detail in U.S. Patents 3,313,747 and 4,066,625. Preferred curing agents of the coreactive or cross linking types include the polyamines, polyamides, polycarboxylic acids, polyphenols and dicyandiamide. Preferred curing agents of the catalytic acceleratcr type include tertiary amines, quaternary aimnonium halides and substituted or epoxy modified imidazoles. Such curing agents can be included in the powder coating compositions of the invention in amounts from 0.1 to 70 by weight of the composition.Curing agents of the coreactive cross linking type are preferably used in amounts from 5 to 70 by weight of the comp3sition. Curing agents of the catalytic accelerator type are preferably used in amounts from 0.5 to 15 by weight of the composition. Flow control agents can cytionally be inoporated into the coating compositions of the invention to aid in levelling the applied and thermoses coating, i.e. to help make the coating as smooth as or smoother than the surface of the substrate to which the coating is applied. Numerous flow control agents are krxwn in the art and are suitable for use in the compositions of the invention, including silicone resins and oils. An example of a commerically obtainable flow control anent is the substance available under the trade name Mcdaflo . Coating compositions of the invention can include from 0.5 to 1.5 weight percent of such levelling agents based on the weight of resin solids. Another optional component of the coating compositions is a pigment material. Cne such preferred pigment is titanium dioxide, but any of the well known conventional pigmenting materials can be used, for example phthalocyanine blues and greens red, yellow, black and brown iron oxides chrome oxide green and natural and synthetic silicas, silicates and carbonates. Sufficient pigmentation is used to provide an opaque or coloured coating as needed for the desired appearance. Pigments can be employed in amounts fran 1 to 60 by weight of the compositions. A highly preferred optional ingredient of the powder coating positions is a conventional epoxy resin of the mono , di or polyepoxide type known to be useful in powder coating compositions.Such nno , di and polyepoxides, for example, can have the same types of oxazolidone free organic backbones as described above with respect to the diepoxide reactant used to form the polyoxazolidone resins.Such conventional epoxy resins generally have an epoxy equivaleccy greater than 1 and an epoxide equivalent weight of from about 190 to 5000. By utilizing a blend of polyoxazolidone resins and such conventional epoxy resins, powder coating compositions having variable and controllable glass transition temperatures can be realized. Power coating compositions of the present invention preferably cerise from 1 to 80 , and more preferably from 102 to 508 by weight of the total epoxy component, of a mono, di or polyepoxide resin material which is not of the polyoxazolidone type, along with from 20 to 99 by weight of the total epoxy component of the epaxy terminated polyoxazolidone. The powder coating compositions of the invention may be prepared by any process which uniformly blends the composition components. Dry blend, semi dry blend or melt blend procedures can be ei ployed to cive a uniform blend dispersion. The uniform blend dispersion can then be pulverized to form the powder coating composition. In a preferred procedure, the polyoxazolidone resin and other ingredients, such as conventional epoxy resin, curing agent, pigments and flow control agents, are dry blended in a mixer and then passed through an extruder and melt mixed. The melt mixed blend is then cooled and pulverized in a suitable milling device to a desired particle size.Particles of the powder coating compositions will generally range in size up to 300 microns, more preferably from 100 to 200 microns. The powder coating compositions of the invention can be applied to substrates by any desired powder coatings process, although fluidized bed sintering z3S , electrostatic powder coating EPC and electrostatic fluidized bed ebb processes are preferred. The coating compositions of the invention are especially well suited for the production of hcmcgenous, firmly adherent coatings on substrates through coating by the fluidized bed or electrostatic spray methods. In fluidized bed sintering FBS a preheated metal part is immersed into the coating powder of the invention, which c is kept suspended by a gentle flow of air. The grain size of the powder is generally from 100 to 200 microns. The powder is suspended by blowing air through the porous bottom of a container so that it assumes a fluidized state. The pieces to be coated are preheated to 250 to 400 C and dipped into this fluidized bed. The immersion time of the material being coated depends on the thickness of the coating that is to be prcduced and amounts to 1 to 12 seconds. In general, the finished coating is prepared in a single procedure in about 3 to 7 seconds. In the electrostatic powder coating EPC process, the coating powder of the invention, which normally has a grain size of under 125 microns, is blown by compressed air into an applicator where it is charged with a voltage of 30 to 100 kV by a high voltage direct current, and sprayed onto the surface of the material to be coated.Then it is baked on at a specific temperature for a specific length of time in a suitable oven. The powder adheres to the cold work piece due to its charge because it loses its charge slowly on account of its high electrical resistance of approximately 1013 to 1017 ohms centimeter. Alternatively, the electrostatically charged powder can be sprayed onto a heated surface or work piece such as a pipe and allowed to cure with the residual heat of the work piece or with addition of external heat. In the electrostatic fluidized bed fez process, the two procedures are combined by mounting annular or partially annular electrodes over a fluidized bed containing the powder so as to produce the electrostatic charge of, for example, 50 to 100kV. Plates heated above the sintering temperature of the powder, for example 250 to 400 C, are briefly dipped into the powder cloud without post sintering, or cold or preheated plates are provided with a powder coating by electrostatic methods and the coating is fused by post sintering at temperatures specific for the powder. Numerous substances can be coated by these powder coating methods with powder compositions of the invention, within the limits allowed by the fusing process or the heating time, as the case may be. The preferred substrates are metals, but other materials such as glasses or ceramic articles or other heat resistance materials can be coated. The follcwing Examples illustrate the invention.
