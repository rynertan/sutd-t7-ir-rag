# Apparatus and method for trace vapour detection.

## Abstract
An apparatus for detecting trace quantities of chemical species in the form of a vapour by subjecting ions produced in a sample of the mixed gases under flow to an ion repulsive electric field which is directed in the opposite direction to the flow of the gases, comprising means such as a fan 13 for drawing the sample through a hollow body, having an inlet 7 , a first region 15 containing means 20 for ionising at least a proportion of the molecules of the sample by a corona discharge, a second region 16 in which the sample is subjected to an oppositely directed ion repulsive electric field and a third region 17 having an electrode 24 for collecting ions of selected polarity. Ions of a selected polarity whose ionic mobilities exceed a value dependent on the strength of the ion repulsive electric field and the velocity of the gas flow are prevented from entering the third region 17 . Means such as a resistor 71 may be provided to limit the current of the corona electric discharge to a value not greater than 100 nanoamps.
