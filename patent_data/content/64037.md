## Abstract
A straight line motion device is described for controlling hydraulic control devices, which is activated by a single lever. The above straight line motion device is supported by the piloting device body 22 of the said hydraulic control by means of the fork 20. The body 22 contains the operating system parts, including four pushers 25, 26, 27 and 28, protruding from the body 22 to then come into contact with cams 16 and 17.
