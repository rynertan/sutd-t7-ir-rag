# SUSTAINED RELEASE QUINIDINE DOSAGE FORM

## Claims
Dosierform zur Langzeitfreisetzung von Chinidin, umfassend einen Behälter, der eine große Anzahl Pellets enthält, wobei der durchschnittliche Pellet Durchmesser nicht größer als 1 mm ist, und jedes Pellet einen Überzug aus Chinidin über Nonpareille Kügelchen umfaßt, und die auf diese Weise Chinidin beschichteten Kügelchen darauf aufgezogen werden mit einer Mischung aus 2 1 3 bis 9 Gewichtsteilen Ethylcellulose auf einen Gewichtsteil Hydroxypropylcellulose, wobei die Gesamtzahl an derartigen Pellets in einem Behälter eine einzelne Chinidin Dosiereinheit bildet.

## Description
Quinidine is a well known alkaloid used in the treatment of certain cardiac arrhythmias. It is a general cardiac depressant, which reduces myocardial excitability, automaticity and conductivity. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a sustained release quinidine dosage form which which comprises a container having therein a plurality of pellets having an average diameter not greater than 1 mm. Each pellet has a coating of quinidine over a nonpareil seed. The quinidine coated nonpareils are then coated with a mixture of two and one third to nine parts by weight ethylcellulose to one part by weight hydroxypropylcellulose. The present invention provides a sustained release quinidine dosage form, typically, a capsule containing from 2,000 to 15,000 of the polymer coated pellets. Each of the pellets is based upon a nonpareil, which is typically a sugar seed having a particle size of 0.7 to 0.85 mm 20 to 25 mesh . The nonpareils are coated with more than an equal amount by weight of a quinidine compound, which preferably is quinidine bisulfate. In a preferred embodiment, about two parts by weight quinidine bisulfate are coated onto one part by weight of nonpareil seeds. In one embodiment, 500 g nonpareil seeds are placed in a coating pan and wetted with a 30 sucrose solution with the aid of a sprayer. Approximately 30 g of quinidine bisulfate are dusted onto the thus treated pellets, distributing the material manually as necessary. Wetting and dusting procedures are repeated until a buildup of 1000 g of quinidine bisulfate takes place per 500 g of the nonpareils. When coated with a greater than equal weight of quinidine, the thus quinidine coated nonpareil seeds are coated with a sustained release polymeric coating mix, which comprises from 2 1 3 to 9 parts by weight of ethyl cellulose to one part by weight hydroxypropylcellulose. In one embodiment, 700 g of quinidine bisulfate nonpareils 2 1 weight ratio , produced above, are charged into an air suspension coating column Wurster column, 15,24 cm six inches , manufactured by Glatt Air Techniques and after commencement of the air suspension of these pellets, there is charged into the air suspension a spray of methanol chloroform 380 ml methanol 1400 ml chloroform which contains 66.8 mg mixture of ethylcellulose Ethocel type 10, Dow Chemical Co. and hydroxypropylcellulose Klucel LF, Hercules , this mixture having a weight ratio of 7 parts ethylcellulose to 3 parts hydroxypropylcellulose. Typical conditions useful for preparing the polymeric coating of the pellets in the above described equipment include a 40 C inlet temperature, 2 bar spray air pressure and a liquid feed rate of 12 cm³ per minute. Pellets produced in accordance with the procedures set forth above yield a sustained release over a prolonged period of time. When tested according to U.S.P. XX dissolution procedure one hour in simulated gastric fluid followed by simulated intestinal fluid the following release characteristics are noted The formulation of the present invention is particularly advantageous for pediatric and geriatric patients who may be either unable or unwilling to swallow a larger sustained release tablet. For pediatric administration it is particularly contemplated that the individually coated polymeric pellets are administered in food.
