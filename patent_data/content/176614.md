# Offset wall bearing.

## Abstract
An engine bearing or bushing having a cylindrical inner bearing surface 36 which is slightly offset relative to the outer surface of the bearing 34. The amount of offset is very small and the offset AB is in a direction generally away from the portion of the bearing exposed to the maximum load. The inner bearing surface 36 is offset so that the oil clearance between a journal member and the maximum load portion of the bearing is minimized to reduce oil film pressure and increase oil film thickness in that region. The offset increases the clearance between the journal member and bearing at a low load area of the bearing to increase oil flow and reduce oil temperature. The transition from the high clearance area to minimum clearance area is uniform so that the oil film thickness will also increase uniformly to its maximum potential.
