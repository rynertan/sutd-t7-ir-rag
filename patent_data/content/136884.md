## Description
Reciprocating Adjustable ChairThe present invention relates to a rocker type chair and has particular utility for assisting physically handicapped persons who cannot otherwise create an effective movement for sexual intercourse.As can well be appreciated there are many physically disabled persons, who, because of the loss of control of limbs or the entire loss of limbs themselves, have difficulty in creating a proper reciprocating motion to perform sexual intercourse. There are also people who have body weight problems which hinder sexual intercourse.For example, there are people who carry so much body weight that they are incapable of assuming a superior or an inferior sexual intercourse position. There are also people who, while having their limbs, are paralyzed and cannot provide the type of motion required for intercourse.The present invention provides a rocker type chair comprising a seat portion, a back portion, a leg rest and a support for the chair. The seat portion is adjustable in height and the leg rest is positionable at an appropriate height with the seat portion. The chair is designed as a mechanical aid for assisting in sexual intercourse through both adjustable positioning of the seat portion and leg rest and the reciprocal motion of the chair when rocking. The rocking movement is one which is effective for copulation and through the provision of the height adjustable seat portion, the chair can be used by couples of various different heights and statures. The provision of the leg rest at the appropriate height, relative to the seat portion, enables the female partner of the couple to be seated in the chair and assume a comfortable relaxed position.As to physically disabled and or handicapped persons, they can use whatever supporting means is available to them to place them in an appropriate position whether they be sitting or standing so that copulation can be carried out.The above as well as other advantages and features of the present invention will be described in greater detail according to the preferred embodiments of the present invention in which Figure 1 is a perspective view looking down on the chair according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention when in a position for normal sitting Figure 2 is a view similar to Figure 1 but set up in its sexual intercourse mechanical aid position Figure 3 is an exploded perspective view of the chair shown in Figures 1 and 2.Figures 1 and 2 both show a chair generally indicated at 1. In Figure 1 the chair is set up for normal sitting position whereas in Figure 2 the chair is set up in an operative position as a mechanical aid for assisting in sexual intercourse.The chair includes a moveable chair body formed from a back portion 4, a pair of arm rests 8 and a seat portion 9.As best seen in Figure 2 the chair body is supported by a supporting frame 3 which remains stationary while allowing rocking of the chair as will be described later in detail.For adjustment purposes, the chair back is mounted on a support rod 5 with a bolt 7 fitted through a groove 6 for tightening of the chair back in any position including a generally horizontal position to which it is adjusted.Seat portion 9 is mounted within grooves 11 on either side of the chair body. These grooves allow the chair seat to be moved to a fully extended position as shown in Figure 1 for normal sitting and to a more retracted position as shown in Figure 2 for assisting in sexual intercourse.When the seat is retracted the female partner in effect sits at the front of the seat where it does not interfere with the sexual intercourse.Provided on the forward end of the arm rests are a pair of leg rests 13 positioned above the seat portion. These leg rests are mounted for pivoting relative to the arm rest to the position shown in Figure 2. When the leg rests are turned to the Figure 2 position the female partner can rest her legs comfortably over the leg rests where they are fully supported while the chair is being used.However, these leg rests need not be a separate moveable item and may in fact simply be an extension of the arm rests to either side of the chair.The chair includes an undercarriage which when in the normal sitting position is enclosed by a pair of doors 15.These doors open outwardly, as shown in Figure 2, to expose a pair of footrests 17 both of which are supported from the frame 3 of the chair. The footrests are used in lieu of the leg rests 13 to provide the leg support. The female partner can place her feet on the footrests and push on them to provide a rocking motion. Also provided are handles 19 on opposite sides of the supporting frame for the chair which can also be used by the seated partner for effecting the rocking motion of the chair body.The chair shown in the drawings is one which is adapted to rock or swing in a generally horizontal direction. In this particular set up the chair has very minima vertical movement during the swinging or rocking so as to maintain a constant height positioning of the person sitting in the chair relative to the partner who would be standing facing the chair. Therefore, the only special factor that will noticeably change with the use of the chair will be the horizontal separation between the two partners.It is to be appreciated that the chair could be provided with up and down movement during the rocking motion to effect sexual intercourse. However, regardless of whether the chair moves in the horizontal or the vertical direction, it will still include a height adjustable seat for appropriate positioning of the seated partner.According to the embodiment shown in the drawings, the mounting of the chair body to the supporting frame to provide the rocking motion is achieved through two pairs of rocker arms 27. These rocker arms are located to either side of the chair and are pivotally secured at one end to the supporting frame and at the other end to the chair body.The amount of backward and forward rocking of the chair body relative to the supporting frame is controlled by a limit system 21 shown in Figures 1 and 2 comprising a plurality of openings 23 and 25 with pins 24 and 26 to fit into these respective openings. These pins are positioned to engage and limit the movement of rocker arms 27 which fit between the limit pins such that pin 26 limits forward movement of the rear rocker while pin 24 limits its rearward movement. With the pins in the lowermost hole, there is the least amount of rocking and with the pins in the highest holes, there is the greatest amount of rocking. Positions in between the two extremes can also be used for varied amounts of rocking. Furthermore, the pins do not have to be at the same height so that the chair may be allowed to rock farther forward than backward and vice versa.A further feature of the chair shown in the drawings is that the chair body is adjustable in height relative to the supporting frame. This height adjustment is achieved by means of a hand operated jack 31 at the undercarriage of the chair. This jack engages an interior chair frame 29 to which the chair body is secured so that the chair body moves up and down with the interior chair frame through operation of the jack. In order to guide the upand down movement of the interior chair frame, the stationary supporting frame is provided with a pair of guide slots 32 while the interior chair frame is provided with a pair of guide bars 30 which slide up and down within the guide slots. This height adjustment system is particularly advantageous when the chair is used as a mechanical aid for sexual intercourse in that it is used to place the partner sitting in the chair at a height compatible with the partner in front of the chair.Further adaptations are easily made to the chair. For example, a motor can be provided for providing the rocking motion to the chair and a further motor can be provided for operating the height adjustment jack. Also, it should be noted that the chair can be spring loaded so as to spring forwardly while the rearward motion is provided by pushing on either the footrest or the handbars to the side of the chair. It will now be seen from the above that the rocker type chair of the present invention is one which is capable of simulating a natural movement for partners in sexual intercourse. As mentioned above, neither partner has to assume a superior nor an inferior position which can present problems, particularly where the bearing down of body weight from one partner to the other is a hindrance.However, it is to be appreciated that although various preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described herein in detail, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that variations such as other types of supports and the like may be made thereto without departing from the invention or the scope of the appended claims.
