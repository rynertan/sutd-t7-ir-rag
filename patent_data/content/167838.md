# Method for producing a scaleable typeface data.

## Abstract
A method for producing scaleable contour data that is capable of providing 1 bit map font data at any resolution and at any point size and, 2 grid aligned contours for output to contour driven devices such as, pen plotters and numeric ally controlled machines, is disclosed. The method stretch es and compresses character contours to bring specified contour points Skeletal Points into proper alignment with the bit map grid . The mathematical basis for the method is one of 1 breaking the character contour into segments between a pair of Skeletal Points , 2 offsetting all coordin ates in the segment to bring the first Skeletal Point to align with the grid, and finally, 3 linear scaling of the segment with a scale factor which brings the second Skeletal Point to align with the grid.
