## Description
Azo bis salicylic acid and salt thereof, and pharmaceutical formulations and uses of said acid and saltThis invention is concerned with a novel composition for the treatment of inflammatory disorders in the intestine, especially ulcerative colitis.The composition contains 4,4 azo bis salicylic acid or its pharmacologically acceptable salts, in particular the disodium salt. The present invention also provides a novel method for treating inflammatory disorders in the intestine IBD , especially ulcerative colitis. The method comprises oral or rectal administration of a compound suitably formulated for its contemplated use e.g. for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, and for rectal administration in the form of an enema or suppository.Medical treatments of ulcerative colitis have been carried out in various different ways. In particular two methods are now in use to a considerable extent Corticosteroids are relied on in severe acute cases, but they have highly objectionable side effects and are therefore unsuitable for more general use. Sulfasalazine is the compound that is being used most generally and most extensively.It is used both in acute phase treatments and prophylactically for preventing an acute condition relapse prevention effect . Sulfasalazine is believed to exert its effect by being cleaved to sulfapyridine and 5 aminosalicylic acid 5 ASA in the patient s large intestine. The cleavage product 5 ASA is believed to be responsible for the therapeutical effect, by direct local action on the intestinal mucosa, while the other cleavage product, sulfapyridine, can hardly be considered to have any positive effect against the disease at all but is responsible for most of the side effects of sulfasalazine treatments. As regards 5 ASA, its only known side effect is a toxic effect on the kidneys. Other methods of treating inflammatory disorders of the intestine comprise rectal or oral treatment with 5 ASA WP A 8102671 , 5,5 azo bis salicylic acid A EP A 0036637 , carboxyphenylazosalicylic acid B EP A 0045006 and its carboxymethylamide C GB A 2080796 . It is believed that when the three last mentioned compounds are administered orally they can be transported to the large intestine where they are then subject to being split in a manner analogous to the splitting of sulfasalazine, to thus form 5 aminosalicylic acid plus another compound p aminobenzoic acid or p aminohippuric acid, respectively. Compounds A, B and C may be considered to act as carriers of 5 ASA during transport through the digestive tract. Splitting of the compound 5,5 azo bis salicylic acid gives only 5 ASA.Moreover it has been found that 4 aminosalicylic acid, PAS, a well known anti tuberculosis agent, may be useful in the treatment of ulcerative colitis by rectal administration EP A 62000 . Oral administration of PAS or of 5 ASA is not recommendable because both of these substances are absorbed long before reaching that diseased region of the large intestine which is their desired target region for exerting their local effect.It is known that such splitting of azo compounds in the intestine as will occur with e.g. sulfasalazine will proceed satisfactorily as long as the azo compound contains a hydroxy group in position para or ortho to an azo group.Upon chemical reduction of azo compounds containing such hydroxy groups, the split amines are formed immediately. If the azo compound does not contain hydroxy groups in ortho or para position note that amino groups give the same effect , reduction will proceed with the formation of stable hydrazo compounds. Much more vigorous reductive conditions are then required for further reducing the hydrazo compounds to form amines. The compund 4,4 azo bis salicylic acid was once considered to be potentially effective against tuberculosis. However, this compound was shown to be inactive against that disease, according to pharmacological testing Ind. J. Med. Res. 40 1952 , p. 4 5, and Ind. J. Pharm. 13 1951 , p. 3 5 .These early results moreover show that under the conditions employed in the in vivo tests no or very little free PAS can have formed by splitting If it had formed, the results obtained ought to have been good ones, that is, the PAS if it had formed would have shown a very good tuberculostatic effect in the animal model chosen. There is nothing remarkable about the results actually obtained, inasmuch as splitting of 4,4 azo bis salicylic acid to PAS was not to be expected because of the greater resistance of the 4,4 compound to reduction as compared to for example the isomeric 5,5 azo bis salicylic acid.Surprisingly, it has now been found that in contrast to the evidence provided by earlier results the 4,4 azo bis salicylic acid as well as salts thereof is split reductively in vivo, with the formation of PAS. The reduction takes place in the large intestine or corresponding organ under the action of the reducing conditions of the local environment.The splitting is a necessary prerequisite for the 4,4 azobis salicylic acid to become effective as an agent against the intestinal disorders, and the present invention is based on the highly surprising discovery that splitting actually does take place. Corroboration of this discovery is illustrated in Example 5.The invention relates to compositions which are novel for treating inflammatory disorders in the intestine. In addition to a therapeutically active amount of 4,4 azo bis salicylic acid and or a salt thereof which is pharmaceutically acceptable and therapeutically active, the compositions according to the invention may optionally contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and or a suitable adjuvant. Examples of suitable salts include salts of said acid with pharmaceutically acceptable alkali or alkaline earth metals, and salts with positively charged and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.The compositions according to the invention may take the form of tablets, dragees, capsules, enemas etc. They are produced in a known per se manner in that 4,4 azo bissalicylic acid is mixed with the desired carrier material and or appropriate auxiliary substances to thus give a suitable galenic form. For example, the composition may be coated with a film that is resistant to gastric juice and is dissolved only after it has reached the intestine. When a composition according to the invention is prepared the free acid may be replaced by one or more of its salts which are suitable for the purpose in question. The amount of acid or its salt per dosage unit will vary, depending in each case on inter alia the number of administrations per day, and the individual and total dosages per day. By analogy with what is known about 5 aminosalicylic acid, it is expected that only a minor portion of the PAS andAc PAS as formed will be absorbed from the large intestine and secreted in the urine.The release of PAS moreover proceeds relatively slowly, which is an advantage especially in cases where the site of the inflammatory intestinal disorder is in the lower portion of the large intestine. The toxicity of 4,4 azo bis salicylic acid, PAS and Ac PAS is remarkably low.Therefore, 4,4 azo bis salicylic acid and its pharmacologically tolerabLe salts are potentially useful agents for the treatment of inflammatory disorders of the intestine, in particular ulcerative colitis. The present invention is also concerned with a novel method of treating inflammatory conditions in the intestine, especially in the large intestine, and in particular ulcerative colitis. The method is characterixed by rectally or orally administering a therapeutically active dose of 4,4 azo bissalicylic acid or a salt thereof which is pharmaceutically acceptable and therapeutically active. This of course also includes the possibility of administering the free acid together with one or more of such salts.According to a preferred embodiment, the acid is administered in salt form, and such a salt may advantageously be an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt, e.g. sodium salt of the acid. Administration is usually performed together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and or a suitable adjuvant.The daily dose of the active substance, 4,4 azo bis salicylic acid, will vary from case to case and may amount to for instance about 0,1 to about 10 g per day and adult weighing 75 kg. In normal therapy cases, a preferred dosage will as a rule give a good therapeutical effect while at the same time side effects are kept at an acceptable low level. The total daily dose may be portioned out among a plurality of administrations per day, for instance 1 to 5 administrations.Where the drug is administered in the form of the salt of the acid, the doses mentioned above refer to the corresponding amount of free 4,4 azo bis salicylic acid.Production of 4,4 azo bis salicylic acid is known per se.The compound may thus be produced according to e.g. Budziarek, R.et al. J. Chem. Soc. 1955 , part III p. 3158 63 . In accordance with this method methyl 4 aminosalicylate is subjected to an oxidative self coupling reaction so as to form 3,3 dihydroxy 4,4t dimethoxycarbonyl azooxybenzene. The azooxy group of the coupling reaction product is reduced whereupon the methyl ester groups are hydrolyzed to thus form the desired 4,4 azo bis salicylic acid. It will be appreciated of course that also other types of syntheses may be chosen, but an important point to be noted is that the synthesis method chosen should give a product of such purity as to be pharmaceutically acceptable. This pharmaceutically acceptable degree of purity means that the product must not contain impurities which give rise to unacceptable side effects. Normally an absolute purity of 98 w w is suitable in this respect, the product having at the same time to fulfill the ordinary quality requirements of medicines.A number of non limitative working examples are set out below.Example 1 4,4 azo bis salicylic acid produced 250 mg according to J. Chem. Soc 1955 part III p. 3158 63 starch 125 mgMg stearate 20 mg Aerosilf 200 silica particles, Degussa, 5 mgFederal Republic of Germany are mixed homogeneously. Water is added, whereupon the mixture is granulated at 60 OC and compressed to form tablets weighing 400 mg.If desired the tablet may be provided in a manner known per se with a coating of a film that is soluble in the stomach or in the small intestine.Example 2 disodium 4,4 azo bis salicylate 250 mg starch 110 mgMg stearate 15 mg are mixed homogeneously and compressed to form tablets weighing 375 mg. Disodium 4,4 azo bis salicylic acid is produced in a manner known per se by means of acidifying an alkaline aqueous solution of 4,4 azo bis salicylic acid to pH 6 7.Example 3The pH of a 10.0 lit. aqueous solution containing 100 g of disodium 4,4 azo bis salicylate is adjusted to pH 7,5, whereupon the solution is filled into 100 ml bottles for rectal administration. The bottles are then sterilized. Example 4Gelatin capsules containing 200 mg of disodium 4,4 azo bissalicylate are produced by automatic filling with crystalline salt of particle size 0.15 2.0 mm obtained by sieve screening.Example 5 Splitting of 4,4 azo bis salicylic acid in the intestine After a single dose of 100 mg kg given orally to mice, urine was collected during a period of 24 hours. The amount of p aminosalicylic acid PAS and Ac PAS, that is, N acetyl paminosalicylic acid present in the urine was measured by means of chemical analysis Willonghby, C.P. et al. but 23 1982 p. 1081 87 .
