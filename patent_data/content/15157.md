# Process and apparatus for separating water from an aqueous mixture.

## Abstract
In the process of the present invention an aqueous solu tion is flash vaporized under a reduced pressure to form, simultaneously, a low pressure water vapour and ice crystals, The ice formed may, if desired, be purified and is then melted inside thermally conductive conduits under a high pressure of, for example, 600 atm. The low pressure water vapour is desublimed to form ice on the exterior of the conduits. The latent heat of desublimation released may be utilized in sup plying the heat needed in the ice melting operation. The desublimate is removed intermittently by an in situ dissolu tion operation utilizing an aqueous solution such as the feed solution. A substantially equivalent amount of ice is formed inside the conduits by an exchange freezing operation. The ice so formed is also melted. An apparatus is provided for carrying out such a process
