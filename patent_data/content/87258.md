# FOLDABLE WHEELBARROW

## Abstract
A wheelbarrow has a single wheel mounted to a foldable body having carrying handles and legs. The body has walls and is defined by a frame which is freely pivotable between an open erected position in which it supports the walls and a storage position. At least two opposed walls of the body are attached to the frame at one edge only and are pivotable from a substantially upright position in which they hold the frame erect to a position which allows the frame to fold. The wheel axle is carried by a support which is rotatable with respect to the body to enable the wheel to be rotated to lie substantially parallel to the base of the folded body. In two embodiments described, the support is mounted on a rod which is rotatable with respect to the body through a bracket attached to or integral with the body. A lever attached to the rod at the rear of the body enables the wheel to be rotated from the normal operating position and a latch is provided to lock the lever when the barrow is to be used.
