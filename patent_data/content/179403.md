# APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING THIN FILM PHOTOELECTRIC TRANSDUCAPPARATUS FOR PRODUCING THIN FILM PHOTOELECTRIC TRANSDUCER ER

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for producing a thin film photoelectric transducer. The transducer has a transparent substrate, an amorphous silicon layer and a metal layer the apparatus has a processing laser for patterning each of the layers. In addition, a separate visible laser is used to detect defects in the layers and the processor laser is then used to correct the defects.
