## Description
METHOD OF DETECTING FREQUENCY IN POWER SYSTEM FIELD OF THE II VENTIO The present invention relates to a method for detection of a frequency in a variable voltage and variable freauency power system. BACKGROUND OF THE ITWEl7TION In a variable voltage and variable frequency VVVF power system for driving a load such as an AC motor by the use of a VVVF power supply, the system is controlled such that the ratio between the voltage applied to the load and the frequency thereof is maintained at a predetermined value. for the purpose of preventing overexcitation of the load. Therefore, if a one phase ground fault occurs in the system during the frequency of the power supplied to the load is being lowered, a protective relay incorporated to protect the system fails to respond to the ground fault since the input thereto is below its operation level.Such a problem may be solved by correcting the input or the sensitibity of the relay in accordance with the frequency of the power system. The frequency is detectable from a voltage generated by, for example, a pilot generator connected to an AC generator.In this arrangement, however, it is required that the pilot generator is to be connected to the AC generator via mechanical coupling means. Consequently, in the case of connecting the pilot generator to the existing AC generator, an additional toil for modifying the installation comes to be needed and thereby brings about some disadvantages with regard to required labor and cost. OBJECT OF TEE IbIVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide an improved method which is capable of detecting the frequency of a VWF power supply at a reduced cost, regardless of whether the power system is a new installation or an existing one, through detection of the voltages on lines connecting between the WVF power supply and a load. In order to accomplish the above object, the method of the present invention is carried out by introducing the voltages on the lines connecting between the VVVF power supply and the load to a voltage detector for producing a detection output which has a voltage value proportional to the frequency of the system According to the present invention, for the purpose of preventing erroneous detection at the occurrence of a short circuit fault, the voltages of the lines connected to the load may be introduced to a lowvoltage detector, and its energized detection output may be utilized to inhibit the operation of the voltage detector. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The foregoing and other objects and advantages of the present invention are apparent from the following detailed description of a specific illustrative embodiment thereof, presented hereinbelow in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a block diagram of an exemplary embodiment arranged to carry out the frequency detection method of the invention and Fig. 2 is a block diagram of another embodiment for carrying out the method of the invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring now to Fig. 1 showing the block diagram implementing the method of the invention, there are provided a power source 1 and a WVF power supply 2 which includes a power unit 2a VVVFU and an output transformer 2b having delta Y connection coupled to anAC motor 3. Also provision is made with a voltage transformer VTRF 4 which detects the interphase voltage VA between the lines of the system at the input terminal of the motor 3. The interphase voltage VA from the transformer 4 is then introduced to a voltage detector VDET 5. In the VVVF system of this type where the system voltage is proportional to the system frequency f, the interphase voltage VA introduced to the voltage detector 5 preserves a predetermined ratio to the system frequency f. Accordingly, the detector 5 produces a detection output having proportional value to the voltage VA, i.e.the system frequency. In case that the neutral point of the system is grounded throuah high resistance or not grounded, the interphase voltage VA is substantially same as that of the normal operating state of the system irrespective with the occurrence of a one phase ground fault in the system, so that an input to a one phase around fault protection relay not shown can be corrected either directly or via a voltage level converter not shown with the interphase voltage VA from the voltage detector 5. In the case of a two phase ground fault where interphase voltages are unbalanced, it is preferable in practical use to be detected the respective interphase voltages of the lines. In the block diagram of Fig. 2 showing another exemplary embodiment of the invention, a current transformer 6 is provided to the power supply lines connected to the motor 3, which has an output fed to an overcurrent detector OVDET 7. When the voltage of at least one phase has exceeded a predetermined value, the overcurrent detector 7 produces a high level output signal to inhibit the operation of the detector 5 for preventing erroneous detection at the occurrence of a short circuit fault.
