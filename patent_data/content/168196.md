# Method for uniformly distributing discrete particles on a moving porous web.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for substantially uniformly distri buting a layer of discrete particles 10 along a predeter mined portion of the uppermost surface of a moving porous web 20 so that the particles 10 occupy less than 100 of the predetermined portion of the uppermost surface of said moving web 20 . The method preferably comprises the steps of a entraining the particles 10 into a moving gaseous stream b passing the gaseous stream through a conduit 7 oriented so as to discharge the gaseous stream containing said entrained particles 10 in a direction substantially parallel to the direction of travel of the moving porous web 20 c mixing the particles 10 entrained in the gaseous stream inside the conduit 7 to provide a substantially uniform distribution of the particles 10 d discharging the gaseous stream containing the uniformly distributed entrained particles 10 from the con duit 7 adjacent the predetermined portion of the uppermost surface of the moving porous web and e maintaining the fluid pressure adjacent the lower most surface of the moving porous web 20 at a level lower than that adjacent the uppermost surface of the web 20 .
