# CAROUSEL MICROPARTICLE SEPARATING, WASHING AND READING DEVICE AND METHOD OF USE

## Abstract
A carousel microparticle separating, washing and read ing device for application in solid phase heterogeneous immunoassay systems and methods of use. After suitable immunological reaction in the microparticle containing sam ple immunoassay mixture, the application of centrifugal force causes the particles to move through a washing solution and into a detection area where labelled microparti cles may be read directly or, following enzymatic reaction of the microparticles with a substrate solution and the conse quent formation of product, the product may be detected.
