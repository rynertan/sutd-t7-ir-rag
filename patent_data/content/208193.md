# Device for the passing of the stitch from a needle for the forming of plain knitting to a needle for the forming of purl knitting and vice versa, in a knitting machine and the like.

## Abstract
The device comprises a small plate 1a, 1b, 1c elastically flexible, longitudinally flanked by a needle 2a, 2b for plain knitting, or purl knitting, and movable in a direction longitu dinal with respect to it. The needle 2a, 2b has on one of its sides an inclined area 8a, 8b with which at least one inclined area 7a, 7b, 7c engages, defined by a bend of the small plate 1a, 1b, 1c at the moment of its motion relatively to the needle 2a, 2b . In this manner an elastic flexing of the small plate 1a, 1b, 1c is obtained moving away from the needle 2a, 2b which defines a loop 3 within which a needle 4 for purl or plain knitting can be inserted, in order to transfer a loop of knittng 13 retained around the loop 3 .
