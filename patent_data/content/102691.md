# Variable displacement compressor.

## Abstract
An axial piston, variable displacement, wobble plate gas or vapor compressor 9 having improved wobble plate C control for rapid response to a compressor inoperative mode. Either a mechnical 110 or spring means 35,38 serves to maintain the reference position during inoperation of the compressor 9 . This control of the wobble plate position provides for rapid response during either operation or inoperation of the compressor 9 , and also provides a stabilizing means which inhibits undesired wobble plate C movement at low crankcase 40 pressures.
