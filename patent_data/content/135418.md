# BREAKERLESS IGNITION SYSTEMS

## Abstract
A breakerless ignition system in which an electronic advance circuit 30 generates an electrical trigger signal SPKE and a mechanical advance circuit generates a mechanical trigger signal PCP . The mechanical trigger signal PCP and electrical trigger signal SPKE are com bined in a trigger circuit 28 to generate an activation signal to a power switching device 40 which causes an ignition circuit 32 to fire a spark plug 54 . In operation the electrical trigger signal SPKE normally provides an accurate timing signal to ignite the plug 54 and the trigger circuit 28 masks the mechanical trigger signal PCP to prevent double firing. Upon failures or special conditions when the SPKE signal is absent the PCP signal will provide operation in a back up mode to ignite plug 54 .
