# Flat cathode ray tube and method of fabricating same.

## Abstract
A flat CRT having a phosphor screen 5 inclined with respect to the center axis 7 of an electron beam 6 and formed by applying phosphors to the inner surface of a tube wall. The tube inner surface is defined by rotating a plurality of logarithmic spiral curves having a constant angle of incidence and present in the x y plane of a polar coordinate system in which the deflection center A of the electron beam is its origin, the center axis 7 extends through the origin and serves as the x axis,and the y axis extends through the origin and intersects the x axis at right angles therewith. The spiral curves are rotated about the y axis each through a specified angle to obtain a group of logarithmic curves defining the tube inner surface.
