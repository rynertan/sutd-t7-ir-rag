# An output transistor of a TTL device with a means for discharging carriers.

## Abstract
In the device a p diffusion region 3 is formed between p type base 6 and p isolation diffusion 5. There is a junction between collector region 4 and p diffusion region 3. When the potential of collector region 4 is less than that of p region 3, region 3 provides a path for discharge of carriers from base 6 to isolation diffusion 5 to speed up switching. When the potential of collector region 4 is higher than that of p region 3, the depletion layer at the junction pinches off the path and isolates the base 6 from the isolation diffusion 5. The p region 3 may be replaced by an extension of the base region 6 up to the isolation diffusion 5. An n region, shorted to collector region 4, may be formed over p diffusion region 3 to provide another junction for pinch off of the path. The path may alternatively provide for carrier discharge to p type substrate 1.
