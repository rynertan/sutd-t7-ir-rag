# Sensor using photo elasticity.

## Abstract
Certain materials e.g. polymers, glasses exhibit the photo elastic effect, whereby when they are subject to stress become birefringent, which influences a light beam passing through the glass. This beam, e.g. from a laser 1 is collimated and circularly polarised as it approaches the glass 4 and is again polarised as it leaves the glass. This stress is applied, according to this invention, by magnetostrictive strips on the glass which are influenced, by the magnetic field to be measured or the AC bias field. A miniaturised arrangement using this principle is described.
