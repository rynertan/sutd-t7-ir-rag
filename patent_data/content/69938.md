# Image detection apparatus.

## Abstract
An image detection apparatus is provided which com prises a two dimensional optical array of lenslets 15 and detectors 19 . The outputs of the detectors are combined to produce a signal 30 indicative of the characteristics of an object being viewed while the outputs of selected detectors are compared to produce a signal 25 indicative of the range to the object. This enables an industrial robot 42 to evaluate the range to an object besides the shape of that object.
