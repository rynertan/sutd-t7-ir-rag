# IMPROVEMENTS IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS FOR ALUMINIUM ALLOY DIE CAST CYLINDERS

## Abstract
The manufacturing process for aluminium alloy die cast cylinders is started with the injection of the molten aluminium separately in the respective dies for the upper cylinder part 10 and the lower part 11 . Thereafter, after the injection op eration is completed and before joining 10 and 11 , both are turned by the mould stripping line 14. To join 10 and 11 , the upper portion of the cylinder 10 heated by any process to achieve expansion of 10 and hereafter, by mere pressure, 10 and 11 are coupled thus forming a single unit on cooling down.
