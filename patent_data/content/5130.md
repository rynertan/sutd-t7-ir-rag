# An arrangement for the processing of a moving material web.

## Abstract
An arrangement for the processing of a moving material web, in particular for the creasing or punching of an extruded material web made of plastics. In the manufacture of such material webs a number of operational steps take place directly in conjunction with the manufacture of the web itself, and the fact that for reasons of quality as well as of manufacturing technique the extrusion process cannot be interrupted makes it necessary to attend to any changes in the crease pattern etc. during operation. The arrangement in accordance with the invention makes this possible, in that the material web can be brought into contact optionally with different pairs of processing rollers with the help of a pair of counter rollers supported in a swivelling cradle, any pair of unused rollers being freely exchangeable against a pair of rollers with a different creasing pattern. The arrangement permits the processing of both sides of the web and the rapid exchange of different processing patterns during continuing production, which is particularly advantageous in the processing of material webs for the manufacture of packing containers.
