# Mold for horizontally and continuously casting molten metal into cast metal strand.

## Abstract
A mold for horizontally and continuously casting molten metal into a cast metal strand, which is horizontally con nected, through a front nozzle 2 , a feed nozzle 3 and a break ring 4 to an opening in a lower portion of a side wall 5 of a tundish for horizontal type continuous casting machine. Molten metal received in the tundish is intermit tently and continuously withdrawn into a cast metal strand in the horizontal direction through the mold by means of a plurality of cycles each comprising one pull and one push. The transverse sectional area of the inner bore 13 of the mold at the inlet end portion thereof becomes gradually larger from the inlet end of the mold toward the middle portion thereof over a prescribed distance ℓ , and the inner bore of the mold has substantially the same transverse sectional area for the remaining portion other than the inlet portion of the mold over the above mentioned prescribed distance ℓ .
