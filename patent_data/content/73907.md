# A method of preparing a gelled food product.

## Abstract
A method of preparing a gelled food product from an ungelled aqueous concentrate containing 10 30 weight per cent gelatin and a urea is disclosed. The concentrate has a gelatin to urea weight ratio of 1 0.3 to 1 1.5, a pH value of 2.57 and gels at less than 20 C. On dilution with water to a gelatin concentration of about 2 weight percent while maintaining substantially the pH value of the concentrate, the diluted composition gels at a temperature above that of the concentrate. Specific concentrates, gelled food products, food product precursor products, and methods for using the concentrates are disclosed.
