# Procedure and means for separating or purifying organic substances.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a procedure and a means for separating or purifying organic substances from a mixture of substances in molten state by crystallizing the substance to be separated purified on a cooled surface. The substance mixture in molten state is conducted at an infeed point 30 into an annular space 13 confined by a rotating cylindrical shell surface 11 , which is cooled, and by another cylindrical shell surface 12 spaced therefrom. The substance to be purified separated is cystallized on the surface of the rotating, cooled shell 11 to form a deposit 20 , which is melted at a first removal point 31 , whereat at least part of the melted purified material is removed and the remaining part is conducted in a return flow B back along the annular space 13 . Impure molten substance mixture is conducted off at a second removal point 32 located, as seen in the direction of rotation A of the cooled shell surface 11 , upstream to the infeed point 30 .
