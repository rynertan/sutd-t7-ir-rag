# Electrochemical apparatus and method of manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
An electrochemical apparatus utilizing an electrochemical cell having a solid electrolyte 4 and at least one pair of porous electrodes 5, 6 arranged in contact with the solid electrolyte, wherein one of the pair of electrodes is exposed through a diffusion means 7 having a diffusion resistance with respect to a gas to be measured to a space in which the gas to be meas ured is present, and an atmosphere near one of the electrodes is controlled by an electrode reaction due to a current flowing through the pair of electrodes. So that the apparatus can be manufactured with a consistent behaviour, a first branch con ductor 11 and a second branch conductor 12 are formed by dividing one of conductors connected to the electrodes, and at least one adjustable first resistive means 2 and at least one second resistive means 13 are formed in the first branch con ductor and the second branch conductor respectively. There fore, the device can be adjusted so that a predetermined cur rent passes through either the first or second resistive means, and thus it is possible to maintain constant quality in large scale manufacturing.
