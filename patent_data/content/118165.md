# Positioning two workpiece portions for stitching together along a desired stitching path.

## Abstract
A pallet is provided for positioning workpiece components e.g. a vamp V and quarter portions RQ, LQ of a shoe upper in position for stitching the portions together, where, when the various components are in a flat condition, the regions corresponding to the desired stitching paths of the various components are not in overlapping relationship that is to say, the pallet enables distortion of at least one of the components in order to bring the regions of the various components into such overlapping relationship. This is achieved by locating e.g. the quarter portions RQ, LQ in a flat condition in relation to a slot 14 of the pallet, which slot corresponds with the desired stitching path, and thereafter positioning the other component, e.g. the vamp V, with part of said region thereof in overlapping relationship with corresponding parts of the quarter portions, and clamping the vamp so that the parts of the regions thereof and of the quarter portions are maintained in overlapping relationship. Thereafter, the remainder of the regions of the vamp can be positioned by distorting the vamp manually, whereafter the vamp is clamped in distorted condition, maintaining the remainder of the regions in such overlapping relationship.
