# Cutting insert for deep grooving.

## Abstract
A cutting insert 10 for use in a deep grooving tool 20 is formed from an elongated generally rectangular block of cutting material having a cutting end 38 . The insert 10 includes a straight cutting edge 40 , dis posed perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the insert and is defined by the juncture between one side edge of the cutting end 38 and the leading surface 32 of the insert. The leading surface 32 of the insert, which is configured for controlling chips, includes a V shaped ridge 44 , spaced from the cutting edge and oriented such that the apex portion 46 thereof is disposed closest to the cutting edge 40 . The leading surface 32 of the insert 10 further includes a groove 48 , which is contiguous with the V shaped ridge, and extends to wards the cutting edge 40 . In one preferred embodi ment of the subject invention, the groove is substantially planar in configuration and extends to and is contiguous with the cutting edge. In a second embodiment of the subject invention, a planar land area is provided between the cutting edge and the groove for effectively spacing the groove from the cutting edge. In the latter embodi ment, the groove 148 is defined by two arcuate seg ments 100 which are disposed in mirror image rela tionship about a central rib 162 . In use, the insert func tions to reduce the width and length of said chips there by increasing the efficiency of the grooving tool.
