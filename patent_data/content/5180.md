# Electrophotographic copying machine including an automatic document feeder.

## Abstract
An electrophotographic copier includes an automatic document feeder ADF 16 operable to feed sheets in turn from a feed stack. In order to produce duplex copies from single sides of the original documents, two copying runs are performed. In the first run, the ADF is controlled by logic circuitry 140 and input circuits 165, 146 to pass odd numbered documents from the feed stack to a receiving stack directly. Even numbered documents are copied. At the end of the run, when all sheets have passed through ADF, the receiving stack is re positioned to form the feed stack, and a stack of produced copies is placed into the copy feed bin. In the second run, copies of the even numbered documents are produced on the back of the copy papers. A collator receives the copies produced by both runs. During the first run, the collator 20 is controlled by logic 142 to stack the sheets such that no re ordering is necessary when they are transferred to the copy feed bin.
