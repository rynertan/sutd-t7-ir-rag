## Description
TITLE A pulse operated electric motor TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a pulse operated electric motor. In a conventional electric motor, a rotor is rotatably mounted within or adjacent to a stator which is rigidly secured to the main structure of the motor. One or more coils of wire are wound onto the stator to constitute an electro magnet, and one or more similar electro magnets or permanent magnets are mounted on the rotor. In operation, electric current is passed through the electro magnet in the appropriate direction so that the magnetic interaction between the stator and rotor magnets causes the rotor to rotate thereby driving the motor. With this conventional construction, the motor speed is dependent upon the amplitude of the magnetic interaction between the stator and rotor magnets, which of course is proportional to the amplitude of the current through the stator winding. If the motor is operated at high speeds, difficulties can arise due to the corresponding high amplitude motor current which is required. It is an aim of the invention to alleviate these difficulties, and accordingly there is provided a pulse operated electric motor comprising a stator, a rotor mounted for rotation with respect to the stator and at least one magnet mounted on each of the rotor and stator, in which either the stator magnet or the rotor magnet comprises either one coil or two electrically separate coils. By electrically separate is meant that the coils are not connected to one another. Each coil is connected to its respective pulse amplifier, and in operation each amplifier is arranged to produce pulses of the same polarity as one another and the generators are connected to their respective coils to produce therein magnetic fields of opposite polarity.The pulses of one amplifier are arranged to alternate with the pulses of the other amplifier so that the two magnet coils are energised alternately to constitute a stator or rotor magnet which changes polarity each time one of the coils is energised. It will be appreciated that the motor speed is proportional to the frequency of the pulses applied to the coils, and consequently the motor speed can be increased without a corresponding increase in the current amplitude in the coils. One motor of the invention has two rotor magnets mounted 180 apart and a single stator magnet. These rotor magnets are arranged to be of opposite polarity to one another so that they are sequentially attracted and repelled by the stator magnet to drive the motor When the motor is running one of the generators can be switched off, and the motor will remain running thereby operating the motor on a push only system. Although the invention is intended to include an electric motor having only one stator magnet, in a preferred embodiment the motor will include at least one pair of diametrically opposed stator magnets. The or each rotor magnet can be either a permanent magnet or an electro iagnet, although a permanent magnet is preferred because it has a greater rigidity which renders it more suitable for operation at high motor speeds. The stator and rotot magnets may be of any suitable configuration, and in two preferred arrangements the rotor magnet is a permanent horseshoe magnet, and the stator magnet is either a bar e ectro magnet or a horseshoe electro magnet.

Referring to the drawings, and particularly toFigure 1, each stator magnet of an electric motor of the invention is energised by pulses from a pulse generator 2. is generator includes a multi vibrator oscillator 4 which generates two independent pulse trains along the lines 6 and 8 which lead from the collector electrodes of two transistors TR1 and TR2.These pulse trains are passed via capacitors C3 and C7 to their respective power amplifiers 10 and 12. The output pulses of the ar lifie.s 10 and 12 are fed to their respective stator coils 14 and 16 which will be described hereinafter. The multi vibrator operates in such a way that when the transistor TR1 s switched on the transistorTR2 is switched off and vice versa so that the stator coils 14 and 16 are energised alternately by currents of opposite drection. The frequency of the multi vibrator oscillator 4 can be varied by suitably adjusting the variable resistors VR1 or VR4. The multi vibrator oscillator 4 and the power amplifiers 10 and 12 are of conventional construction and their circuit components are given at the end of this Specification. Referring to Figure 2, an electric motor includes two stator coils 13 and 20 each having two stator coils thereonFor clarity, only the stator coils 14 and 16 on the stator core 20 are shown.The stator cores 18 and 20 are diammetrically opposed and are spaced apart to receive the rotor not show of the motor between them. The them. stator coils 14 and 16 are connected to the respective outputs of the power amplifiers 10 and 12 which are arranged so that in operation the coils 14 and 16 are energised alternately with pulses of opposite polarity to one another. The rotor has mounted thereon four permanent magnets which are spaced apart at 90 to one another so that each.rotor magnet is adjacent to and parallel to the stator coils 14 and 16 asit passes the stator cores 20 and 18. The physical arrangement or cr.e r..o or stator and rotor can be appreciated from a study of Figures 2, 3 and 4. The two stator cores 18 and 20 are of horseshoe configuration with the end faces 22 and 24 constitutin the poles of each stator core The two stator coils 14 and 16 are wound round the linear base 26 of each stator core, the two coils 14 are connected in parallel to the output of the power amplifier 10, and the two coils 16 are connected in parallel to the out of the power amplifier 12. The rotor 28 comprises two brass cross members 30 which are mounted on a rotor shaft 32. Four permanent magnets 34, 36, 38 and 40 are mounted at their opposite ends to the outer arm portions of the rotor cross members so that as the rotor rotates the poles of each rotor magnet pass adjacent to respective poles of the two stator core6 18 and 20. Referring particularly to Figure 3, the diammetrically opposed magnets 34 and 38 are of the same polarity as one another with their North poles illustrated, and the magnets 36 and 40 are of the same polarity as one another with their South poles illustrated. When the stator coils 14 and 16 are not energised, the magnets 35 and 4C will be attracted to the af ent ta cores 20 and 18 respectively. thereby rotation e r r to the position in Figure 3. When the illustrated generator 2 is switched on a pulse is fed to each stator coil 14 thereby setting up a magnetic field in the stator cores 18 and 20. Assuming that this magnetic field repels the rotor magnets 36 and 40, then the rotor 28 will commence to rotate clockwise, and as the magnets 34 and 38 approach the stator coils these magnets will be attracted to the stator cores 20 and 18 respectively.The pulse generator frequency is controlled so that when the rotor 28 has r at d through 90 to bring the magnets 34 and 38 JuSt past the stator cores 20 and 18 respectively, then the stator coil 14 a ede energised, and the stator coils 16 are energised, thereby reversing the polarity of the magnetic field through the stator cores 18 and 20. In consequence, the stator cores 48 and 20 repel the rotor magnets 38 and 34 thereby continuing the clockwise rotation of the rotor 28, and attract the magnets 36 and 40 as they approach the stator cores 18 and 20.When trie magnets 36 and 40 have just passed the stator cores 18 and 25, the stator cores 16 are de energised, and the stator coils 14 are energised with a pulse of the initial polarity thereby continuing the clockwise rotation of the rotor 28. It will be appreciated that this rotation of the rotor 28 is produced by the alternate energising of the stator coils 14 and 16 with pulses of opposite polarity to one another, and having a frequency such that each stator coil is energised as soon as an appropriate rotor magnet has joist pasY çd the. stator core. For simplicity, the above description has referred to only one pair of stator cores each having the two pulse energised stator coils wound thereon. In practice any number of similar stator cores can be included in the electric motor, and the greater the numDer of pulse energised coil mounting stator cores and rotor magnets the greater the uniformity of thrust applied to the rotr as it rotates. It is to be understood however that this invention includes within its scope an electric motor in which the pulse energised stator coils are mounted on only one stator core. In the above described example, the stator coils 14 and 16 are each formed of 28 gauge enamelled copper wire and weigh approximately two ounces. Each stator core 18 and 20 is made of soft iron laminations which are bolted together. The stator and rotor magnets may have any suitable shape and configuration. For example, Figure 5 illustrates an electric motor in which each rotor magnet is a horseshoe permanent magnet 42 and each stator magnet is a bar electromagnet 44. Figure 6 illustrates an electric motor in which each rotor magnet is a horseshoe permanent magnet 46, and each stator magnet is a horseshoe electro magnet 48. The circuit components or the multi vibrator oscillator 4 and the power amplifiers 10 and 12 are as follows VR1 1K TR5 2N457PNP R5 1K VR2 22K VR5 10K R6 5.6K VR3 22K VR6 10K R7 330 OHMS VR4 1K C3 10MFD R8 200 OHMS C1 10MFD C4 10MFD R9 47 OHMSC2 10MFD C5 .0015 TR1 BD138PNP C6 100MFDTR2 BD138PNP C7 10MFDTR3 BC148NAN R2 1KEMI9.1 TR4 BD135NPN R3 22 OHMS VR7 1.5 MEG R4 68K VR8 1.5 MEG VR9 1K In the previously described and illustrated electric motors of the invention, the rotor has mounted thereon four permanent magnets.Figures 7 and 8 illustrate a rotor having four electro magnets mounted on aM electrically insulated from the rotor structure of Figures 2 to 4. The electro magnets comprise magnetic cores 50, 52, 54 and 56, and wound thereon associated coils 60, 62, 64 and 66. Two slip rings 68 and 70 are mounted on and electrically insulated from the rotor shaft 32, and the coils are connected in series between these slip rings 68 and 70 as illustrated. The slip rings 68 and 70 make electrical contact with positive and negative DC lines 71 and 73 coupled to a source of DC voltage not shown . When the DC source is switched C7. the energised coils 60 to 66, produce two mutually perpen cular pairs of magnets with the magnets in each pair of like polarity and of opposite polarity to the magnets of the other pair. It will b seen that these electro magnets have the same configuration as the permanent magnets of Figure 3, and that the construction of Figures 7 and 8 does away with the need to use permanent magnets. In the previously described and illustrated electric motors of the invention, two electrically separate coils have been wound round at least one stator core. In operation, these coils are energised alternately so as to produce electro magnets of opposite polarity to one another thereby driving the motor. The invention includ t within its scope an electric motor in which two such coils are wound round at least one rotor core in order to drive the motor. Figuie 9 is a diagrammatic plan view of part of r tteV rotor of an electric motor of the invention. Four rotor cores are mounted on and electrically insulated from a rotor constructed as in Figures 3 and 4. Figure 9 illustrates two such diametrically opposed rotor cores 72 and 74, and it will be appreciated that there are two further similar cores equally spaced between the cores 72 and 74. Electrically separate coils 76 and 78 are wound round the core 72, and similar electrically separate coils 80 and 82 are wound round the core 74. Three slip rings 84, 86 and 88 are mounted on and electrically insulated from the rotor shaft 32. The slip rings are electrically coupled to the outputsof the power. amplifiers 10 and 12 and the negative line 90 respectively of Figure 1. As will be seen from Figure 9, the coils 82 and 78 are connected in series between the slip rings 84 and 88 so that these coils 82 and 78 are connected in series across the output of the power amplifier 10. Similarly, the coils 76 and 80 are connected in series between the slip rings 86 and 88 so that these coils 76 and 80 are connected in series across the output of the power amplifier 12. The coils of the two further rotor cores are connected in a similar manner across the output of the power amplifiers 10 and 12. The stator poles may form a part of permanent magnets, or alternatively they may be energised by electro magnets as illustrated in Figures 2 and 3. The operation of the rotor illustrated in Figure 9 is basically similar to the stator illustrated in Figure 2.The alternating magnetic fields of the rotor react with the magnetic fields of the stator to provide the required rotation of the rotor thereby driving the motor. Those aforementioned rotors of the inventiOn including permanent magnet rotors have the advantage that power is not induced into the rotors from the stator poles, thereby reducing power loss. The impedence of the stator windings increases with the operational speed of the motor. However, this increase in impedence of the stator windings can be reduced by progressively switching from a series wound stator winding configuration to a parallel wound stator winding configuration as illustrated in Figure 12. Referring to Figures 10, 11 and 12, a further electric motor of the invention includes eight stator cores of which two cores 92 and 94 are illustrated in Figure 10. Two stator coils are wound round each stator core the coils 96 and 98 are connected in parallel to the output of the power amplifier 10, and the coils 100 and 102 are connected in parallel to the output of the power amplifier 12. The rotor 104 includes two brass end members 106 and 108 which are mounted on a rotor shaft 110. Eight permanent magnets 112 to 126 are mounted at their opposite ends to the outer portions of the rotor end members 106 and 108 so that as the rotor rotates the poles of each rotor magnet pass adjacent to respective poles of the eight stator cores. Referring particularly to Figure 11 all diametrically opposed rotor magnets are of the same polarity as one another and adjacent magnets are of reverse polarity to one another. The stator cores are secured to opposed casing plates 128 and 130 by elongate mounting screws 132 which enable each stator core to be adjusted relatively to these plates and to the rotor 104. The rotor shaft 110 is rotatably mounted in these casing plates 128 and 130 by suitable bearings. As previously mentioned, in order to reduce the increase in the stator winding impedance with motor speed, it is desirable for the stator windings to be switched progressively from a series wound configuration to a parallel wound configuration. Referring to Figure 12, this stator winding configuration change can be carried out by means of the two double pole two way switches 134 and 136. As shon inFigure 12, eight stator coils are connected between the ponmr amplifier 10 and the negative line 90 and eight stator coils are connected between the amplifier 12 and the negative line 90 illustrated in Figure 1. When these switches 134 and 136 are in the full line positions illustrated in Figure 12, eight stator coils are connected in series between a respective amplifier 10 and 12 and the native line 90.When these switches 134 and 136 are switched to their dotted line positions, each group of eight stator coils is formed into two sub groups of four coils, these sub groups being in parallel with one another between the respective amplifier 10 and 12 and the negative line 90. One way of producing sufficient power to drive the eight stator motor illustrated in Figures 10, 11 and 12, is by means of thyristors using capacitor turn off techniques. The motor speed can be calculated by dividing the frequency of the current from the amplifiers 10 and 12 by the number of stators in the motor. The motor illustrated in the Figures 10, 11 and 12 operates efficiently over a considerable range of speeds, and the torque can be varied by varying the voltage supply to the motor. This motor is a synchronous motor having a variable speed and a variable torque which can be operated economically from a DC source. Referring to Figure 13, a further electric motor of the invention includes three coaxial rings of permanent magnets 138, 140 and 142 mounted on a rotor 139. Six stator cores 141, 143, 145, 147, 149 and 151 are mounted to the motor casing 153 along a diameter of the rotor magnet rings. Figure 14 is a circuit diagram of a synchronous starter and a variable pulse generator for energising the stator cores of the motor of Figure 13. The starter and generator includes six silicon controlled rectifiers or thyristors 144 to 154, in which the thyristors 152 and 154 are connected to stator coils 156 and 158 on the inner magnet ring 138, thyristor 150 is connected to a stator coil 160 on the intermediate magnet ring 140, and thyristor 146 is connected to a stator coil 162 on the outer magnet ring 142. The pulse generator circuit includes switches Sla, and S2 and S3 in the positive voltage line 164, and a switch Slb which is ganged with switch Sla. In operation, the pulse generator is adjusted to operate at a frequency of 16 cycles per second, and the switches Sla,S1b, 2 and 3 are closed. This causes a gate firing pulse to be passed to the thyristors 146, 150 and 154 which are thereby switched on to energise the stator coils 162, 160 and 158.After this initial firing pulse, the subsequent gate firing of the thyristors is carried out by the pulse generator which fires the thyristors at the desired frequency. The frequency of the pulse generator is steadily increased to 64 pulses per second thereby increasing the rotor speed of the motor to 4 revolutions per second. The switch 52 is then opened to switch off the thyristors 152 and 154 thereby removing the motor drive from the inner magnet ring 138. The rotor continues to rotate due to the drive exerted by the intermediate magnet ring 140. The pulse generator frequency is switched to 16 pulses per second tO enable the intermediate magnet ring 140 to become synchronised. The pulse generator frequency is then increased to 64 pulses per second thereby increasing the rotor speed to 16 revolutions per second. The switch 53 is then opened to switch off the thyristors 143 and 150 thereby removing the drive from the intermediate magnet ring 140. The pulse generator frequency is . switched to 32 pulses per second in order to synchronise the outer magnet ring 142, and the pulse generator frequency is increased to 64 pulses per second to increase the rotor speed to 32 revolutions per second. The inner magnet ring 133 is operated on a push pull system with two stator coils 156 and 158 connected to the thyristors 152 and 154, and the intermediate and outer magnet rings 140 and 142 are operated on a push system only in which only one stator coil 152 and 160 is connected to each thyristor set 144 and 146, and 148 and 150 respectively. The layout of the permanent magnets in the three coaxial rings 138, 140 and 142 on the rotor 139 maintains the correct magnetic phasing to allow only one pulse generator to be used, and simplifies the drive circuit. The Switching Operation of the Starter and Generator Referring to Figures 13 to 15, firstly, the switchesS2 and S3 of the starter and generator of Figure 14 are closed, Then the switches Sla and Stb are closed thereby feeding a firing pulse from the synchronous starter to the thyristors 154, 150 and 146. These three thyristors are thereby turned on and energise the coils 158 on the stator cores 145 and 147, the coil 160 on the stator cores 143 and 149r and the coil 162 on the stator cores 141 and 151. The coils 158, 160 and 162 are each two separate coils which are mounted on different stator cores and connected to one another to make a single coil as illustrated in Figure 14. When the thyristors 154, 150 and 146 are turned on, the thyristors 152, 148 and 144 are off. The synchronous starter circuit is arranged so that the starter ceases to operate after feeding a single firing pulse. This firing pulse is generated instantaneously by closure of the switchesSla and Slob. Closure of switch Sla causes the capacitor C1 to commence charging through the variable resistor VR1.When the voltage across the capacitor C1 has reached the firing potential of the uni junction transistor 163, this transistor fires and discharges the capacitor C1 across the resistor R3. This discharge causes the firing pulse to be fed to the gates of the thyristors 152, 150, 148, 146 and 144. The layout of the resistor and diode associated with the thyristor 154 prevents a pulse from reaching the gate of this thyristor 154. The thyristors 150 and 146 are already switched on as previously described, and they ignore this later firing pulse.However, the thyristors 152, 148 and 144 are turned on by this firing pulse thereby causing the capacitors C2, C3 and C4 to change polarity which turns off the thyristors 154, 150 and 146. The resistors R1 and R2 connected between the positive voltage line 164 and the anode of the thyristors 148 and 144 prevent these two thyristors from self latching, and these two thyristors 148 and 144 turn off leaving the thyristor 152 switched on and the coil 156 energised. As soon as the capacitor C1 has discharged, the uni junction transistor 163 switches off thereby allowing the capacitor C1 to charge up again through the variable resistor VR1.When the voltage across the capacitor Cl has reached the firing potential of the transistor 163, a further firing pulse is fed to the thyristors 154, 150, 148, 146 and 144.These thyristors are thereby turned on to energise the coils 158, 160 and 162. The thyristor 152 is switched off by the change in polarity of the capacitor C2 caused by the thyristor 154 being switched on. This switching action deenergises the coil 156. The resistors R1 and R2 prevent the thyristors 148, and 144 from self latching, and these two thyristors turn off. The thyristor 152 does not receive a pulse because of the resistor and diode layout of the circuit. The aforementioned circuit action continues thereby energising alternately the stator coils so as to rotate the rotor 139 of the electric motor. If a fixed resistor is used to charge the capacitor Cl, then the pulse gener ator of Figure 14 will operate at a stable frequency so as to rotate the rotor 139 at a constant frequency. By using the variable resistor VR1 to charge the capacitor Cl, it is possibe to feed a firing pulse to the switching circuit at a desired one of a number of different frequencies thereby correspondingly varying the rotational speed of the rotor 139. The circuit of Figure 14 includes two variable resistorsVR1 and VR2 either of which can be connected between the positive voltage line 164 and the transistor 163 Dy means of the switch S4. The transistor 163 is switched betw2en the variable resistors VR1 and VR2 by the switch S4 so as to switch the pulse generator frequency instantaneously from 64 pulses per second to 16 pulses per second as previously described herein. An important feature of the motor of Figures 13 and 14, is that the pulses required to drive the amplifiers 10 and 12 or to fire the gates of the thyristors 144 to 154 could be pre recorded on magnetic tape. This tape could then be replayed when it is required to operate the motor in either a single or a variable speed mode. This would remove the need to couple a motor directly to a multi vibrator or a uni junction transistor pulse generator, and would make the motor programmable.
