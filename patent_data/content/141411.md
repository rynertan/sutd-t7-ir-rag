The main frame assembly houses a tape supply cartridge 10 within a cartridge receiving cavity and supports various other operative mechanisms within the apparatus. Specifically, the frame assembly includes a pair of spaced apart frame members 11 and 12 which lie in planes generally parallel to one another. The two parallel frame members 11 and 12 are securely mounted with respect to the main apparatus housing 14 by a plurality of mounting brackets 15, 16, 17 and 18. The frame members 11 and 12 are maintained in a rigid, spaced relationship by a plurality of spacing elements 20. Positioned near the top of each of the frame members 11 and 12 is a reinforcement plate 21 and 22, respectively.The plates 21 and 22 are connected with the frÅame merbe s 11 and 12 by threaded members, welding, or other appropriate means and provide the frame assembly with reinforcement to resist the lettering force. As will be described in greater detail below, and as illustrated best in Figures 1, 3, 4, 7 and 9, the upper portion of the frame assembly in the area of the reinforcement plates 21 and 22 includes overhanging portions 24 spaced from the main portion of the frame by the recessed area 25. These overhanging portions 24 each include a support surface 33 Figure 14 to provide support for a force resisting arm 26 to resist movement of a print bar 30 and thus create the lettering force. During a lettering cycle, the print bar 30 and surface 32 move upwardly toward the arm 58 with a tape 13, ribbon 27 and font element 23 disposed in the recessed area between the arm 58 and surface 32. The rearward ends of the frame members 11 and 12 are provided with a bracket 28 for supporting a font rotation post 29 Figure 2 . The means for generating the lettering force is illustrated best in Figures 4, 7, 9 and 12. Figure 12 is a pictorial, exploded view of the various force generating elements while Figures 4, 7 and 9 show such elements at various iti ing a lYtterin cycle. The force generatingJnPans includes an elongated print or lettering bar 30 which is pivotally secured at one of its ends between the frame members 11 and 12 about the pivot 31. The pivot 31 extends generally perpendicular to the frame members 11 and 12. The other end of the lettering bar 30 is provided with a force generating surface 32. In the preferred embodiment, this surface 32 is comprised of a polyurethane or other similar material.During a lettering cycle, the print bar 30 is caused to pivot about the pivot 31 so as to generate the lettering more. The end nf the print bar 30 near the surface 32 is provided with a laterally extending opening 34 for connection with a force transfer link 35. The link 35 includes a pair of spaced apart flanges 36, 36 with openings 38, 38 for pivotal connection with the opening 34. A pivot pin 39 extends through the openings 34 and 38 to pivotally secure the transfer link 35 to the print bar 30. The other end of the transfer link 35 is pivotally secured to a portion of a pivot link member 40 by the pivot pin 41 extending through the opening 42.The link 40 is pivotally secured between the frame members 11 and 12 about a pivot shaft 44 Figures 4, 7 and 9 extending through the opening 45 Figure 12 and provided with an eccentric bushing 47. The link 40 is also provided with a closed loop force transfer surface 46 and a motion transfer pin 48 supporting a roller 114. The force generating means also includes a rotatable member 49 which is directly connected with the shaft 50 for rotation therewith. The shaft 50 is in turn driven by a motor 51 Figure 2 . The member 49 includes an opening 52 to which a flanged roller 54 is secured by the pivot pin 55. A washer 56 is positioned between the roller 55 and the member 49. When assembled, the roller 55 is adapted for rolling, motion transferring engagement with the irregularly shaped opening 46 as the member 49 rotates on the shaft 50. The opening 46 is configured so as to provide the mechanical advantage needed to create the lettering force. During a lettering cycle, the rotating member 49 driven by the shaft 50, is caused to rotate one revolution.This movement in turn causes pivotal movement of the link 40 about the shaft 44 as a result of engagement between the roller 54 and the surface 46. The pivotal movement of the link 40 in turn transfers movement via the transfer link 35 to the force generating end of the lettering bar 30. This upward movement of the lettering bar 30 about its pivot 31 during a lettering cycle creates a lettering force or pressure between the surface 32 and the force resisting arm 58. The sequential movement of the various link and other members of the force generating means at various points during a lettering cycle is shown inFigures 4, 7 and 9. As illustrated best in Figures 10 and 11, the apparatus also includes means for varying or adjusting the lettering force. In the preferred embodiment, this means includes the provision of an eccentric bushing 47 mounted on the shaft 44 which pivotally supports one end of the link 40.As the shaft 44, and thus the bushing 47, is rotated, the position of the pivotal support for the eccentric link 40 is changed. This in turn varies the permitted vertical movement of the print bar 30 and pad 32 during a lettering cycle. Such variance in permitted vertical movement results in greater or lesser lettering force being generated during a lettering cycle. For example, as the bushing 47 is rotated so as to raise the pivot point of the link 40, the lettering force will be increased. Conversely, as the bushing 47 is rotated so as to lower the pivot point supporting the link 40, the lettering force will be decreased. Rotation of the bushing 47 and thus vertical adjustment of the shaft 44 is controlled by a cable assembly. The cable assembly includes a hub 125 and flange portion 126 connected to the shaft 44 for pivotal movement therewith.A cable 128 has one end connected with the flange 126 and its other end connected with an actuator 130 Figures 1 and 2 on the housing, such structure facilitates selective rotational movement of the bushing 47 to vary the lettering force. The cable assembly is disposed within a housing 129 connected with the frame member 12. Also forming part of the force generating means is the means for resisting movement of the print bar 30. This means is illustrated best in Figures 2 and 3 and includes the force resisting arm 58 which is pivotally secured to a force resisting bracket 59 about the pivot pin 60. The bracket 59 is securely connected with the frame member 11 and the reinforcing plate 21 by a pair of threaded connecting members 61, 61. The force resisting arm 58 is pivotable about the pin 60 between an inoperative position as illustrated by the solid lines inFigure 2 and an operative position illustrated by solid lines in Figure 3 and by the phantom lines in Figure 2. When in its operative position, the upper surface of the force resisting arm 58 is engaged with the downwardly facing support edges or surfaces 33 Figure 14 of the overhanging portions 24.In the preferred embodiment, these support surfaces 33 are defined in part by the frame members 11 and 12 and in part by the reinforcing plates 21 and 22. The outer end of the force resisting arm 58 is provided with a gripping tab 62 to facilitate manual movement of the arm 58 between its operative and inoperative positions. In the preferred embodiment, the arm 58 is provided with detent means at both ends of its movement so that the arm 58 cannot be inadvertently moved from either its inoperative or its operative position without manually doing so. When in its operative position, the force resisting arm 58 extends laterally, at generally right angles, with respect to the parallel planes of the frame members 11 and 12. A tape cut off feature is illustrated best in Figures 12 and 14. Connected with an upper surface of the print bar 30 is a tape cut off support member 64 provided with a cut off edge 65. Disposed to the rearward side of the cut off edge 65 is a tape shield 66 for protecting the tape 13 when the cut off feature is not being utilized. Pivotally secured to the lettering bar 30 about the pivot 68 is a cut off link 69. One end of this link 69 is provided with a cut off pad 70 for movement toward the cut off edge 65. The other end is connected with a force transfer link 71 which is pivotally secured to an actuating toggle linkage 72. The linkage 72 is pivotally secured to the frame member 12 about the pivot 74 and includes an end which is connected to a cut off solenoid 75.Upon actuation of the solenoid 75, the actuating linkage 72 is caused to pivot counterclockwise about its pivot point 74.This in turn imparts movement through the transfer link 71 to the cut off link 69 in the direction of the arrow 76 in Figure 14. As a result, the cut off pad 70 moves downwardly toward the cut off edge 65, thereby cutting off or severing the tape 13. The solenoid 75 is connected to the actuating link 72 via the solenoid plunger 78 and the spring 79. When the solenoid plunger 78 is released, the link 72 is returned to its normal rest position illustrated by the solid lines in Figure 14 by the spring 80. The spring 80 is connected between a portion of the frame member 12 and a portion of the link 72. Movement of the link 72 toward its rest position is limited by the stop member 81. The means for advancing the tape 13 within the cartridge 10 is illustrated best in Figures 1, 4, 7 and 21. In the preferred embodiment, this means includes a stop arm 82 and a drive arm 84. Both the stop and drive arms 82 and 84 are pivotally secured about the pivot member 85 which extends between and generally perpendicular to the frame members 11 and 12. The stop arm 82, which is independently pivotable froJt1 t drive arm 84 is rigidly connected with, and therefore pivotally movable with, a letter spacing arm 86. The stop arm 82 is an elongated member extending upwardly from the pivot point 85 and including an upper stop arm end adapted for engagement with a portion of the tape supply cartridge for limiting advancement of the tape 13 within the cartridge.In the preferred embodiment, as shown in Figure 21, the upper end of the stop arm 82 is adapted for engagement with a stop or limit surface 88 of a shuttle assembly for limiting the forward movement of such assembly and therefore advancement of the tape 13. The limiting position of the stop arm 82 is in turn defined by the corresponding position of the letter spacing arm 86. As illustrated best in Figures 16 and 17, the lower end of the spacing arm 86 is pivotally secured with respect to the pivot 85 for common pivotal movement with the stop arm 82, while the upper end is adapted for engagement with a cam surface 89 of the cam member 90. The cam member 90 is rotatably secured with respect to the kerning slide 91 about the pivot 92. Rotation of the cam member 9D about the pivot 92 causes pivotal movement of the spacing arm 86 because of engagement between the upper end of the arm 86 and the cam surface 89. This pivotal movement of the spacing arm 86 results in similar pivotal movement of the stop arm 82, thus defining the stop position for advancing the tape 13 within the cartridge 10.The cam member 90 is connected with a toothed gear 94 which in turn is operatively associated with the toothed rack 95 mounted for sliding movement within the slide member 96. The slide member 96 is secured to the kerning slide 91 by appropriate connecting means. Movement of the toothed rack 95 is driven by a cable assembly 98 which is controlled by movement of an appropriate tab 97 connected with the sppat housing 14 Figure 1 . Lateral movement of the toothed rack 95 results in corresponding rotational movement of the cam element 90. This in turn causes pivotal movement of the spacing arm 86 and stop arm 82 to define the desired stop position. By adjusting the stop position of the arm 82, the letter spacing can be adjusted. The drive arm 84 is also pivotally secured to the pivot 85 but, except for engagement between the arm 84 and a laterally extending portion 115 of the arm 82, is movable independent of the stop arm 82. The drive arm 84 includes an upper drive arm end which is adapted for driving engagement with a drive arm receiving cavity within the tape supply cartridge. In one embodiment illustrated in Figure 21, this cavity is defined by the pair of drive tabs 99. The means for causing pivotal movement of the drive arm 84 about the pivot 85 is shown best in Figures 4, 7, 9 and 16. Such means includes the link members 100, 101, 102 and 104. Each of the link members 101, 102 and 104 is adapted for pivotal movement about the pivot 105 between the frame members 11 and 12.The link member 100 includes one end which is pivotally secured to a portion of the drive arm 84 about the pivot 106 and a second end which is pivotally secured to a portion of the link 101 about the pivot 108. The link members 1Q2 and 104 are pivotally secured at one end between the frame members 11 and 12 about the pivot 105 with their opposite ends being connected to, and biased together by, an extension spring member 109.The spring 109 is connected at its ends to the outer ends of the links 102 and 104. Each of the links 102 and 104 is provided with a pair of force transfer surfaces 110 and 111.The force transfer surface 111 of each of the links 102 and 104 is adapted for engagement with an outwardly extending post 112 on the link 101, while the force transfer surface 110 of each of the links 102 and 104 is adapted for engagement by a roller member 114 pivotally secured to the post 48 on the link 40. During revolution of the rotational member 49, and thus pivotal movement of the link 40, the roller 114, through engagement with the surfaces 110, 110, causes corresponding movement of the link members 102 and 104. This movement in turn is transferred to the link member 101 as a result of engagement between the post 112 and the surfaces 111, 111.Pivotal movement of the link 101 in turn is transferred via the force transfer link 100 to the drive arm 84. It should be noted that the spring 109 connected with the outer ends of the links 102 and 104 provides an override feature for the arm 84 in both directions. In other words, if movement of the drive arm 84 is limited, in either a rearward or a forward direction, the machine will continue to cycle, with the only consequence being the stretching of the spring member 109. Such override will usually occur during a normal lettering cycle. During such cycle, rearward movement of the drive arm 84 will be limited by means within the cartridge such as the spacing ring 43 Figure 21 . Forward movement of the drive arm 84 is limited as a result of engagement between the drive arm 84 and the laterally extending portion 115 of the stop arm 82.Thus, in a normal lettering cycle, it is contemplated that there would be need for an override at each end. The lettering apparatus of the present invention is also provided with a means for sensing the amount of tape remaining in an inserted cartridge. This means is illustrated best in Figures and 15 and includes a tape sensing element 116 mounted on one end of a tape sensing linkage 118. A pair of metal rollers 119, 119 are rotatably secured tD ar upper end of the element 116 for engagement with the tape supply 13 within the cartridge 10. The linkage 118 is pivotably secured to the frame member 11 about the pivot point 120. An opposite end of the linkage 118 is connected with a tape indicator 121 Figure 2 on the housing by a string 122 or other means for transferring movement of the linkage 118 to the indicator 121.In the preferred embodiment, the indicator 121 is visually observable. A switch 47 is also mounted on the outer surface of the frame member 11. This switch 47 includes a switch element 53 which is engageable by a portion of the linkage 118. A spring 57 is connected with the end of the string 122 to bias the linkage 118 in a counterclockwise direction about the pivot 120 as viewed in Figure 15. When no cartridge is in the cavity, the linkage 118 and sensing element 116 are in the positions illustrated by the broken lines and solid lines, respectively, in Figure 15. When in this position, engagement between a portion of the linkage 118 and the switch element 53 deactivates the entire system, thereby preventing a cycling of the machine. When a cartridge 10 is introduced into the cartridge receiving cavity formed between the frame members 11 and 12, te roller members 119 engage the. remaining tape 13 within the cartridge. As a result of such engagement the element 116 will be moved downwardly and the linkage 118 will be pivoted in a clockwise direction as viewed in Figure 13. This downward movement releases the switch element 53 to allow activation of a lettering cycle. Such movement also results in the indicator 121 reflecting the amount of tape remaining in the cartridge 10. As the tape 13 within the cartridge is used, the linkage 118 will pivot in a counterclockwise direction as the element 116 and rollers 119 move upwardly into the cartridge. This movement in turn results in the indicator moving toward the end indicating exhaustion of the tape supply.In the preferred embodiment, the rollers 119, 119 are constructed of a conductive metal and are electrically connected to respective electrical conductor elements 124, 124. These conductors are in turn connected with an appropriate electronic sensing mechanism. It is contemplated that the end of the tape supply will be provided with a piece of metal foil. Thus, when the rollers 119, 119 contact the metal foil at the end of the tape, an electrical circuit will be closed, thus actuating a visual or audio signal to advise the user that there are only a few inches of tape remaining to be used. This will enable the user to finish the word which he or she is lettering before inserting a new cartridge. The means for providing proper spacing for certain letter combinations and for properly aligning the cartridge 10 is illustrated best in Figures 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20. This means includes a kerning assembly comprising a kerning slide 91 which is mounted for sliding movement with respect to the frame member 12. As illustrated in Figures 19 and 20, the kerning slide 91 includes an alignment tab member 130 which extends inwardly through an opening 131 in the frame member 12. The tab 130 extends inwardly past the inner surface of the frame member 12 for appropriate engagement with an alignment notch 132 on the cartridge 10. The slide 91 also includes an alignment spring member 134 Figures 16, 17 and 18 having a pair of alignment members 135, 135 on its inner surface.This spring member 134 comprises a plate spring member which is connected with the inner side of the kerning slide 91 and extends inwardly into the cartridge receiving cavity through an opening 136 in the frame member 12. The alignment tnembp 135 are adapted for engagement with corresponding alignment openings 138, 138 in a side wall of the cartridge 10. The alignment elements 135, 135 not only assure proper vertical and horizontal alignment of the cartridge 10 with respect to the frame members 11 and 12 but also biases the cartridge 10 toward the frame element 11. This facilitates proper alignment of the cartridge 10 during a lettering cycle. It should be noted that the inner surface of the frame member 11 is preferably provided with a plurality of wear tabs or elements for engagement with the side wall of the cartridge 10. The kerning slide 91 includes a plurality of elongated openings 139 to permit the slide 91 to be slideably connected with the frame member 12. The rearward end of the kerning slide 91 includes a kerning bracket 140 and a kerning post 141 for appropriate engagement with a kerning ring on the inside surface of the lettering font. Also connected with the rearward end of the kerning slide 91 is a spring member 142 having its outer end connected with a kerning solenoid 144. It can be seen that actuation of the solenoid 144 will cause the solenoid plunger 145 to move toward the right as viewed inFigure 16, thus causing corresponding movement of the kerning slide 91 to the position illustrated in Figure 17.Such movement, however is limited as a result of engagement by the kerning post 141 with the kerning ring on an inside surface of the font. Following actuation of the solenoid 144, the force is released and the kerning slide 91 is returned to its rest position as a result of the spring member 146. The spring 146 is connected between an end of the slide 91 and a portion of the frame member 12. The normal or rest position of the kerning slide is defined by engagement between the limiting post 148 and a portion of the corresponding opening 139. It should be noted that the cam member 90 is mounted on the kerning slide 917 thus, rearward movement of the slide 91 will result in corresponding clockwise pivotal movement of the spacing arm 86 and thus rearward movement of the stop arm 82.Also, as a result of engagement between the portion 115 of the stop arm 82 and the drive arm 84, rearward pivotal movement of the stop arm 82 results in corresponding movement of the drive arm 84. Thus, rearward movement of the kerning slide 91 results in corresponding rearward movement of the entire cartridge as well as rearward movement of the stop arm 82 and the drive arm 84. The means for insuring proper alignment of the font during the printing cycle is illustrated best in Figures 5, 6 and 8. This means includes a housing portion 148 connected with the frame member 11 and a pivot arm 149 pivotally secured to an outer end of the housing 148 about the pivot 150. An alignment tab 151 having an alignment notch 152 is connected with a top surface of the arm 149 for engagement with an alignment rib on the font 23 Figures 4 and 7 . The arm 149 is biased upwardly relative to the housing 148 by the compression spring i54. An elongated member 155 extends through the spring 154 and has a head 156 engaging a portion of the arm 149. The other end of the member 155 extends through an opening in the housing 148 and has a head 158 engaging a pivotable link 159.The link 159 is pivotally secured to the frame member 11 about the pivot 160 and includes a force transfer surface 161 for engagement by the roller 162. The roller 162 is connected with the member 49 for rotation therewith about the shaft 50. When the member 49 is in the position illustrated inFigure 5, the roller 162 engages the surface 161 to cause the right end of the link 159 to be in a down position. This in turn causes the arm 149 to also be in a down position against the force of the spring 154 as a result of the member 155 and respective engagement between its heads 156, 158 and the members 149, 148. In this position, the font is freely movable on the font post 29 Figure 21. As the lettering cycle continues, the roller 162 rotates out of engagement with they surface 161. This allows the arm 149 and the link 159 to move upwardly as a result of the spring 154 acting against the housing 148 . Such upward movement causes the alignment tab 151 and notch 152 to move upwardly into engagement with the alignment rib on the underside of the font. Although the description of the preferred embodiment has been quite specific, it is contemplated that various modifications could be made without deviating from the spirit of the present invention. Accordingly, it is contemplated that the scope of the present invention be dictated by the appended claims, rather than by the description of the preferred embodiment.
