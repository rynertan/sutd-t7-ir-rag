# Fabrication of two level polysilicon MOS devices.

## Abstract
A common defect in MOS devices of the overlapping polysilicon electrode type is unacceptably low breakdown voltages due to breakdown in the oxide separating the elec trodes and or separating one of the electrodes from the subs trate. In the invention the first electrode 14 is etched to remove portions a undercut by a previous oxide etching process. The subsequently grown oxide layer is then of more even thickness and thus less susceptible to breakdown.
