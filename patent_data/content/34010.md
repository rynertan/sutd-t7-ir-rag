## Description
Substituted thiosemicarbazones and use as lat growth regulants. Description of the Invention Many chemical substances have been found to have growth regulating effects on plants. Change of shape of plants, crinkling and folding of leaves, stunting of growth, defoliation, stimulation of root growth on cuttings and other effects are frequently observed. It is usually neces sary to apply growth regulating substances to plants at comparatively low rates in order to have the growth regulating effects clearly evident. At higher rates a selective kill of vegetation is usually obtained, as some species of plants are affected more than others. Growth regulants have, in fact been used more as selective herbicides than for other purposes because in many instances the growth regulating effects exhibited by these substances have no other practical utility.However, a class of growth regulator compounds has now been discovered that produces a number of useful effects, differing from one plant species to another. For example, some of these compounds promote tillering branching at the base of the plant in oats and other grains and taller growth and increase of fruit set in tomatoes and certain other plants Briefly, the class of growth regulator compounds has the general structural formulaEMI1.1 EMI1.2 and X is O or S R is H, C1 to C4 alkyl or an agriculturally acceptable cationR1 is H or C1 to C4 alkyl or hydroxyalkylR2 is H or C1 to C3 alkyl is is H, C1 to C8 alkyl, cycloalkyl or alkenyl, adamantyl, naphthyl, l,3,4 thiadiazol 2 yl, phenyl or mono or disubstituted phenyl in which the substituents are selected from C1 to C4 alkyl, C1 to C alkoxy, benzyloxy, chloro, bromo,C1 toc a 4 fluoro, iodo, cyano or trifluoromethyl, Z is halogen andR4 is C1 to C3 alkyl, allyl, benzyl or carboethoxymethyl.Synthesis of the Growth Regulators The novel class of growth regulators may be synthesized by means of the following illustrative procedures.Preparation of 2 Carbomethoxybenzaldehyde Ref J. Chem.Soc. C , p. 1818 1979 . To a solution of 24.8g 0.165 mole of phthalaldehydic acid in 450 ml of acetone was added 65 g 0.47 mole of potassium carbonate and 29.8g 0.21 mole of methyl iodide.The mixture was refluxed overnight, cooled, and filtered.The acetone was removed by evaporation, the residue dissolved in ether, washed with water, dried and filtered.Evaporation gave 22g of the desired product as an oil.

The spray mixtures were prepared by dissolving the proper amount of growth regulator compound in 15 ml of acetone, adding 4 ml of a solvent emulsifer mixture consisting of 60 wt. percent of a commercial polyoxyethylated vegetable oil emulsifier t96 wt. percent active ingredient, Emulphor EL 719 , 20 wt.percent xylene and 20 wt. percent deodorized kerosene, then bringing total volume up to 60 ml by addition of warm water.Twenty one days after seeding and treatment the plantings were examined and plant injury was rated according to the following schedule. DEGREE OF EFFECT 0 no effect 1 slight effect, plants recovered 2 moderate effect, injury to 26 to 75 percent 3 severe effect, injury to 76 to 99 percent of foliage 4 maximum effect all plants died Post emergent Application Several species of plants were grown in potting soil in disposable styrofoam trays and tomatoes were grown in four inch pots in the greenhouse. Aqueous spray formulations were prepared and the growing plants were sprayed at a spray volume of 60 gallons per acre and an application rate of 5 lb . per acre. Spray mixtures were prepared in the manner described above. For comparative purposes, plants were also sprayed at 60 gal. acre with a spray mixture containing no growth regulator.

by treating tomato plants Lycopersician esculentum to increase fruit set. In an illustrative experiment, Soja mar Evans variety and Lycopersicum esculentum Tiny Tim variety were grown in 4 inch pots one plant per pot filled with greenhouse potting soil 2 parts good top soil , 1 1 2 parts builders sand, 1 1 2 parts peat, fertilized with 5 ib. of 12 12 6 fertilizer and 5 lb. of finely ground limestone per cu. yd. .Aqueous spray cormulations were prepared and the potted plants were sprayed at a spray volume of 40 gal. per acre and at application rates of 16, 4, 1 and 1 4 oz. per acre. The spray mixtures were prepared by dissolving the proper amount of growth regulator compound in 15 ml. of acetone, adding 2 ml. of a solvent emulsifier mixture consisting of 60 wt. percent of a co ercial polyoxyethylated vegetable oil emulsifier 96 wt. percent active ingredient, Emulphor EL 719 20 wt.percent xylene and 20 wt. percent deodorized kerosene, then bringing total volume up to 80 ml by addition of a 0.156 wt.percent aqueous solution of liquid non ionic dispersant 90 wt. percent active trimethylnonyl polyethylene glycol ether, Tergitol TMN 10 . Two replicates were sprayed at all application rates. For comparative purposes, plants were also sprayed at 40 gal. acre with water. The number of seed pods and of fruit as percentage of arithmetic mean of the numbers on untreated plants was observed within approximately three weeks after spray treatment and the results are tabulated below. The severity of growth regulatory effect on the plants was estimated on a scale of 0 to 10 and is also recorded in the following table GROWTH REGULATING EFFECTS ON TWO SPECIES Soja max Lycopersicum esculentum Compid.Rate Pod Count Severity of Fruit Count Severity of No. oziA.

The information presented in tabular form herein will enable a worker in the art to make a selection from among the growth regulator compounds of the invention and to make some judgment with regard to application rates depending upon the effect which is desired. It may be seen, for example, that total kills of some species of vegetation may occur at application rates as high as 5 to 10 Ib. per acre, whereas beneficial effects may be observed on living plants at application rates of 1 lb. per acre or less. The growth regulator compounds are usually applied in combination with inert carriers or diluents, as in aqueous sprays, granules and dust formulations in accordance with established practice in the art An aqueous spray is usually prepared by mixing a wettable powder or emulsifiable concentrate formulation of a growth regulator with a relatively large amount of water to form a dispersion. ettable powders comprise intimate, finely divided mixtures of growth regulator compounds, inert solid carriers and surface agents The inert solid carrier is usually cheser frown among the attapulgite clays, the kaolin clays, t montmorillonite clays, the diatomaceous earths, finely divsd d silica and purified silicates. Effective surfactants, which have wetting, penetrating and dispersing ability are usually present in a wettable powder formulation in proportions of from 0.5 to about 10 percent by weight. Among the surface active agents commonly used for this purpose are the sulfonated lignins, naphthalenesulfonates and condensed naphthalenesulfonates, alkylbenzenesulfonates, alkyl sulfates and non ionic surfactants such as products of condensatior. ce ethylene oxide with alkylphenols. Emulsitiable concentrates of the growth regulator compounds comprise in each instance, a solution of growth regulator compound in a liquid carrier which is a mixture of water immiscible solvent a .d surfactants, including emulsifiers. Useful solvents include aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as the xylenes, alkylnaphthalenesr petroleum distillates, terpene solvents, ether alcohols and organic ester solvents. Suitable emulsifiers, dispersing and wetting agents may be selected from the same classes of products which are employed in formulating wettable powders. In general, the growth regulators are seldom applied without the presence of a carrier or surfactant.However, direct application to plant seeds prior to planting may be accomplished in some instances by mixing powdered solid growth regulator with seed to obtain a substantially uniform coating which is very thin and comprises only one or two percent by weight or less, based on the weight of the seed. In most instances, however, a nonphytotoxic solvent, such as methanol is employed as a carrier to facilitate the uniform distribution of growth regulator on the surface of the seed. When a compound is to be applied to the soil, as for a pre emergence application, granular formulations are sometimes more convenient than sprays. A typical granular formation comprises the growth regulator compound dispersed on an inert carrier such as coarsely ground clay, or clay which has been converted to granules by treatment of a rolling bed of the powdered material with a small amount of liquid in a granulating drum. In the usual process for preparing granular formulations, a solution of the active compound is sprayed on the granules while they are being agitated in a suitable mixing apparatus, after which the granules are dried with a current of air during continued agitation.
