# Pressure compensation mechanism.

## Abstract
A pressure compensation mechanism for a dual control piston variable ratio drive pulley has a central chamber 54 disposed between the control pistons 50 and 38 . The central chamber is filled with fluid from control passages 36 and 34 , and is open to exhaust through a controlled restriction 62 . The fluid in the central chamber increases in pressure with increased rotational speed of the pulley 10 , to compensate for the effect of centrifugal pressure build up on one of the control pistons. The controlled restriction establishes the base pressure in the central chamber so that the resulting pressure in the central chamber compensates for centrifugal forces in excess of the centrifugal effect on one of the control pistons, and compensates at least partially for the centrifugal pressure effect on the other of the control pistons.
