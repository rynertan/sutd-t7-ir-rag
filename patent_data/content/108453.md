# Gas fired device for generating heat for a dwelling.

## Abstract
A gas fired device for generating heat for a dwelling, comprising a vessel 1 containing a liquid with an associated burner assembly 2 for heating said liquid, an air heat exchanger 3 provided on a portion of the circumferential wall of said vessel, means 11 for passing air through said heat exchanger for heating said air and a connection with means for passing the heated air to the room s to be heated, and a discharge for the combustion gases extending to the outside on the remaining portion of the circumferential wall of said vessel a combustion gases heat exchanger 4 being mounted so that heat is supplied to the vessel exclusively from the outside. Preferably a cooking assembly 24 is provided above said vessel, and a condensor 14 is mounted in the discharge for the combustion gases for pre heating the air, a charge conduit for the combustion gases from the cooking assembly being provided which leads also to said condensor. Combustion air is supplied by means of air inlet conduits 21 which are connected with a channel leading to the outside of the dwelling for the supply of atmospheric air. The vessel including the burner assembly is mounted in a rectangular housing which fits in a kitchen cupboard of standard size. Preferably a heat exchanger coil 5 or the like is immersed in the liquid inside said vessel.
