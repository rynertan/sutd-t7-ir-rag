# Data display unit for a bicycle.

## Abstract
A running data display unit 1 for a bicycle calculates running data such as running speed, running distance, average speed, maximum speed etc. of a bicycle, based on pulse signals from a revolution detecting portion 3 . This calculation is performed by a microcomputer incorporated in the display unit. The running data obtained by the calculation are displayed in a digital form on a liquid crystal display panel 15 . The liquid crystal panel 15 also makes display of a pulse mark 26 . The display of the pulse mark 26 turns on and off alternately at the rise of the pulse applied normally from the revolution detecting portion 3 . As a result, by the display of the pulse mark 26 , the rider of the bicycle can ascertain normal operation of the display unit 1 , particularly normal operation of the revolution detecting portion 3 .
