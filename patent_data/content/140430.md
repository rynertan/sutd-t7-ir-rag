# Frequency multiplying circuit.

## Abstract
A frequency multiplying circuit which is particularly suitable for battery operated portable radio equipments at VHF, such as radio paging receivers. The basic frequency multiplying circuit comprises a differential amplifier formed by two transistors TR1, TR2 whose emitters are connected by a current source 24 to a low voltage supply rail, collector resistors R1, R2 are connected to a higher voltage rail as is also done with the base electrode of one of the transistors, the base electrode of the other of the transistors has an oscillator connected thereto. An LC resonant circuit L1, C1 coupled between the collectors of the two transistors TR1, TR2 and is tuned to select either the basic frequency of the oscillator 12 or an odd harmonic thereof. In order to overcome problems of excessive damping of the resonant circuit 14 due to the collector resistors R1, R2 of the differential amplifier being effectively in parallel therewith which damping is made worse when the load of the following stage is added, it was found that the frequency multiplying circuit could provide a high quality factor and low power consumption if the coupling between the differen tial amplifier and the resonant circuit 14 is reduced and also if the effect of the load of the next following stage was overcome. This is achieved by connecting a negative resistance circuit 22 across the resonant circuit. The negative resis tance circuit 22 comprises a transistorised differential amplifier, the base electrodes of the transistors TR3, TR4 are cross connected to the collector of the other transistor, to form a negative conductance which is in parallel with the positive conductances which are causing the resonant circuit to be lossy. Hence the parallel loss conductance is reduced in value and the effective Q is increased.
