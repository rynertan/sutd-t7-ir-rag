# Silver catalyst and method for the manufacture of ethylene oxide.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a supported silver catalyst for the manufacture of ethylene oxide prepared by a process comprising impregnating a porous catalyst support with a solvent containing a silver salt and treating the impregnated support to effect deposition of silver on the support surface. Following silver deposition, the support is impregnated with a liquid containing more than 30 , by volume, of an organic solvent capable of forming a complex with silver ion, and a compound of at least one metal promoter in an amount sufficient to deposit the desired amount of metal cation on said support. The impregnated support is then treated to effect deposition of the promoter. There is also described herein a process of making such catalyst and a process for producing ethylene oxide.
