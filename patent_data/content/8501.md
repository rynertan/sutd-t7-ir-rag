# Power supply circuit for a data processor.

## Abstract
In order to extend battery life when batteries are used and to conserve energy when commercial power is used, it is highly desirable that power not be applied to a data processor when it is not operating. A power supply in accordance with the present invention includes a power up and supply subcir cuit 100 that applies power to an associated data processor 500 when a data input circuit 700 is operated to select a particular operation of the processor. Ideally, when the pro cessor completes its operation, it provides an output signal to a power down subcircuit 200 of the power supply which then removes power from the processor.
