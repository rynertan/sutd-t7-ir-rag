# Process for the preparation of a Fischer Tropsch catalyst, a catalyst so prepared and use of this catalyst in the preparation of hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
A Fischer Tropsch catalyst is prepared by impregnating a silica carrier with a solution of a zirconium or titanium com pound, calcining the composition thus obtained, thereafter im regnating with a cobalt compound containing solution and calcining and reducing the composition thus obtained. Cata lysts so prepared and containing 5 40 pbw of cobalt and 2 150 pbw of zirconium or titanium per 100 pbw of silica, are sed in the preparation of hydrocarbons from a Hâ‚‚ CO mix ture.
