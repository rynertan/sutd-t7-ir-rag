# Low density compacts of prepared mix for use in the production of silicon and ferrosilicon, method and apparatus for making same.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a low density, porous compact of prepared mix containing silica fume, finely divided carbo naceous reducing agent such as petroleum coke or coal, optionally iron and a binder. There are also disclosed a method and an apparatus for making such a compact. The compact is useful as the feed to an electric furnace in the production of silicon and ferrosilicon.
