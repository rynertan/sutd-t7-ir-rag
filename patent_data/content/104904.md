# Compositions comprising mineral particles in suspension and method of treating aqueous systems therewith.

## Abstract
An aqueous slurry of mineral particles, for example calcium carbonate and or calcium hydroxide, has a mineral solids concentration of at least 40 m m and contains an agent that maintains the slurry at a pumpable viscosity but that acts as a flocculant upon dilution of the slurry. Suitable agents include cationic and amphoteric polyelectrolytes having nitrogen containing groups, for example polyamines and dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride polymers. The slurries may contain other components, for example a synthetic hectorite or a dispersing agent such as a polyacry late, polymethacrylate or polyphosphate. The slurries are useful in papermaking and in the treatment of sewage.
