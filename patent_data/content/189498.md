# Field emission scanning auger electron microscope.

## Abstract
The Auger electron microscope is equipped with a field emission tip 10 maintained at an essentially constant distance above the surface of the specimen 7 . The tip 10 may consist of a tungsten 100 whisker having a radius of 50 nm at the apex, the working distance being on the order of 1mm. Auger electrons emitted from the surface of the specimen 7 are collected by an electron energy analyzer 11 for conventional processing. Mutual scanning displace ment between tip 10 and specimen 7 is obtained by an xyz drive module 6 which is also responsible for adjusting the working distance of the tip 10 . The entire microscope set up is mounted on vibration damping means 4, 5 and may be inserted into a vacuum system by means of an appropriate flange 1 , if need be.
