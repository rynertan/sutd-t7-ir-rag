# Optical information reading apparatus.

## Abstract
In an optical disc player or other apparatus in which a light beam L is directed through an objective lens 10 to be focused thereby at a record medium surface for optically reading information recorded in a track on the surface, the objective lens 10 has its central axis offset with respect to the longitudinal axis of a cylindrical body 16 forming part of a movable assembly A and through which the light beam L passes axially, and the cylindrical body 16 is both angularly displaceable about its longitudinal axis and axially displaceable relative to a guide bearing 21 forming part of a fixed assembly B to correct for tracking errors and for focusing errors, respectively. The fixed assembly B further includes a magnetic circuit 19 generating a magnetic field which intersects coils 14, 15a to 15d included in the movable assembly A to receive focusing error and tracking error signals, respectively.
