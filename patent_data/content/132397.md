# SOIL WORKING IMPLEMENT

## Abstract
A soil working implement is of the kind having a support frame 13 on which at least one soil working tool 10 is mounted, the tool being preferably of the kind having a tool portion 34 passing edgewise through the ground at an angle to the verti cal. The tool portion 34 has a soil engaging surface 51 which is inclined at an acute angle to the direction of travel A so that, with the tool 10 offset to one side of the line of action X of the frame, forces tending to generate a turning moment in the hori zontal plane are counteracted by engagement of the soil by the inclined soil engaging surface 51. Additionally or alternatively the support frame 13 may be adjusted to angle the tool 10 relative to the direction of travel.
