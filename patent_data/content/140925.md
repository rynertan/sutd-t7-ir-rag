## Description
The detection and classification of digitally modulated signals in a broad band without knowledge of their carrier frequency, modulation type, or modulation rate has long provided a difficult problem for receiver designers. Energy detection receivers such as crystal video detectors, scanning receivers, filter bank or channelized receivers, and spectrum analyzers have been the only practical type of receivers available for such use. However, they are severely limited in their ability to detect and classify specific modulation types and rates, and their performance degrades rapidly when more than one signal is present at the input. The advantages of digital modulation in communication and radar have long been recognized. Now that the era of practical implementation and deployment of such systems has arrived, an effective detection and classification receiver is essential. Current receiving systems, designed for use against conventional signals, must be expanded to cope with digital modulation in order to maintain their effectiveness. Until now, it has been virtually impossible to detect and classify a noncooperative or low level digitally modulated transmission for which the key modulation parameters and center frequency are unknown. In detecting noncooperating transmitters, it is essential to It is also important that any such receiver exhibit The state of the art in digital modulation techniques is best described in the following publications The fundamental characteristic of all digital modulation techniques is the conversion of the original information into a unique set of discrete symbols drawn from a finite alphabet.

Optional features of this and various of the other aspects of the invention are set out in claims 52 to 61. In connection with the description following, the parameters are indicated in Table 9 and defined on pages set forth in Table 9. This invention may be more clearly understood from the following detailed description and by reference to the drawings, in which A block diagram of the receiver of this invention is shown in Fig. 1. The signal band s t received by the antenna 11 is introduced into the Signal Conditioner 12. The Signal Conditioner 12 prepares the signal band for convenient processing by all subsequent blocks, and typically consists of a series of frequency translations, amplifications, and filtering common to the RF and IF stages of a conventional radio receiver. The Signal Conditioner 12 may also amplitude limit or convert the representation of the received signal to another form, such as 1 from analog continuous to digital time discrete, 2 from real to complex analytic, or 3 combinations of the two. Although not explicitly shown in Fig. 1, these functions of the Signal Conditioner 12 may also be implemented at other locations within the receiver. The output of the Signal Conditioner 12 is fed into the Constant Phase Stage 13, where it is first filtered by controllable bandpass Filter 14. The variable bandwidth of Filter 14 is selected by the Timing and Control subsystem 120 described in connection with Table 5 p. 47 , and is usually a function of the desired signal to noise ratio, search bandwidth, processing gain, and anticipated received signal bandwidth. The output of Filter 14 is then input to the Ambiguity Transform circuit 15, described below and illustrated in several embodiments in Figs. 2 through 5. In those embodiments, the output of the Ambiguity Transform circuit 15, designated χ₁ f, τ ₁ , is simultaneously routed to the Reference Selector circuit 16, the Envelope Detector circuit 20, and the Signal Selector circuit 21 and then the same signal is output on lead 22 to the Linear Phase Stage 30. The Reference Selector 16 of the Constant Phase Stage 13, by command from the Timing and Control subsystem 120, selects particular values of the Ambiguity Transform circuit 15 output to be used as adaptive noise references for signal detection. The output of the Reference Selector 16 is envelope detected in the Envelope Detector 23 and introduced along with the output of Envelope Detector 20 into the Comparator 24. The Comparator 24 evaluates the Envelope Detector output 20 relative to the Envelope Detector output 23. If the former exceeds the latter by an amount specified by the Detection Logic circuit 200, then Constant Phase spectral line detection is declared on lead 31. The corresponding values of f and τ ₁ for which detection is declared are routed to the Detection Logic circuit 200 on lead 31 and on to the Timing and Control subsystem 120 on lead 201 for analysis and use in the Signal Selector 21. The Signal Selector 21 receives the Ambiguity Transform circuit 15 output on lead 27 and, by command from the Timing and Control subsystem 120 on leads 101 and 102, extracts the values of χ₁ f, τ ₁ at the specified values of f and τ The output of the Constant Phase Stage 13 on lead 22, designated χ₁ f, τ₁ , generally constitutes the input to the Linear Phase Stage 30 for Linear Phase signal detection and classification. This stage 30 is identical to the preceding stage 13, as is clear in Fig. 1, and identical elements are given the same reference numerals with an L suffix. The Comparator 24L again evaluates the Envelope Detector output 20L relative to the Envelope Detector output 23L. If the former exceeds the latter by an amount specified by the Detection Logic 200, then Linear Phase spectral line detection is declared on lead 31L. The corresponding values of f, τ ₂ for which detection is declared are routed to the Detection Logic circuit 200 on lead 31L and on to the Timing and Control subsystem 120 on lead 201 for analysis and use in the Signal Selector 21L. As in the previous stage, the Combiner 29L produces the symbol phase for all Linear Phase signals. The output of the Linear Phase Stage 30 on lead 22L generally constitutes the input to the Quadratic Phase Stage 40 for Quadratic Phase signal detection and classification. This stage 40 is identical to the preceding stages 13 and 30, as is clear in Fig. 1, and identical elements are given the same reference numerals with a Q suffix. Again, the Comparator 24Q declares spectral line detection when the specified threshold is exceeded, and the corresponding values of f, τ ₂, and τ ₃ are specified. The Combiner 29Q again produces the symbol phase for all detected Quadratic Phase signals. The receiver of this invention consists of N stages in series, as represented by stages 13 through N, shown in Fig. 1. The number of stages is determined by the desired order of modulation to be detected. These N stages are identical to the stages described above, as is clear in Fig. 1, and identical elements are given the same reference numerals with an N suffix. The Timing and Control subsystem 120 provides timing and control for all the receiver processing blocks shown in Fig. 1. Each block is therefore synchronized with the same Clock 121. All block functions, including variable parameter values, are selected or commanded by elements of this subsystem, such as filter bandwidth by the Bandwidth Control 122 ambiguity transform delays by the Delay Control 123 Fourier transform parameters control by the Fourier Transform Control 124 delay selection by the τ Select 125 frequency selection for signal selectors 21 through 21N by the f Select 126 the detection threshold for Comparators 24 through 24N by the Threshold Select 127 and the integration time selection for the Ambiguity Transforms 15 through 15N by the T The Detection Logic subsystem 200 accepts the Comparator 24 through 24N outputs from all stages and decides if spectral line detection in a particular stage is a valid indication of signal presence for that stage modulation type . If a signal is declared present by a signal exceeding the threshold set in the Comparators 24 through 24N, the Detection Logic subsystem 200 feeds the following outputs to the Timing and Control circuit 120 signal phase information, signal frequency, symbol rate, and Ambiguity Transform delay τ , all introduced into the Timing and Control circuit 120 for passage to the Indicators 25 through 25N. The Indicators 25 through 25N may include meters, digital displays, digital bit outputs, or indicator lamps. It is possible for more than one stage of the receiver of this invention to detect spectral lines at the same time. This may occur under either or both of the following conditions The first condition is typical of system operation. The second condition, however, requires the Detection Logic 200 to always apply the following rule when the n Signal presence is declared for the n following criteria is satisfied If neither of the above criteria is satisfied, no signal presence is declared for the candidate spectral line. The above rule is augmented to include hybrid signal detection, as discussed later and shown in Fig. 8. The outputs of the Envelope Detectors 20, 20L, 20Q, ..., 20N are also routed on leads H, H Figures 1a through 1e present examples of the received signal as it passes through the first two receiver stages. In these examples, we assume the spectrum of the received signal at the antenna 11 is as shown in Fig. 1a. It consists of a wideband emitter, three narrowband interferers NBIs , a phase shift keying PSK signal with symbol duration τ ₁ an M ary frequency shift keying MFSK signal with symbol duration τ ₂, and background noise. The receiver bandwidth at the Signal Conditioner 12 of Fig. 1 is as indicated, and signals falling outside this passband are therefore eliminated. The center frequencies of all signals in the receiver band in Fig. 1a are completely arbitrary, though we have specifically selected the frequency separations between the narrowband interferers such that they will contribute spectral energy at the PSK and MFSK symbol rates. This set of special NBI frequencies shows the capabilities of our receiver system under adverse conditions. Figure 1b shows the signal output spectrum from the first stage noise path Envelope Detector 23, and the resulting threshold level labeled Noise NBI estimate used by the Comparator 24. Figure 1c shows the signal output spectrum from the first stage signal path Envelope Detector 20. As desired, both outputs contain similar signals derived from the NBI, background noise, and wideband emitter. However, only the signal path Fig. 1c contains spectral lines derived from the first stage processing of the PSK, and a new PSK signal derived from the first stage processing of the MFSK signal. Since the PSK derived spectral lines are clearly above the indicated threshold, they are detected and the presence of PSK is declared. The frequency location of the spectral lines is f Figure 1d shows the signal output spectrum from the second stage noise path Envelope Detector 23L, and the resulting threshold level labeled Noise NBI estimate used by the Comparator 24L. Figure 1e shows the signal output spectrum from the second stage signal path Envelope Detector 20L. Again, both outputs contain similar signals derived from the NBI, background noise, and wideband emitter. However, only the signal path contains spectral lines derived from the two cascaded stages operating on the MFSK signal. Since these spectral lines are clearly above the indicated threshold, they are detected and the presence of MSFK is declared. As before, the symbol rate is determined to be 1 T An understanding of the spectral line generation capability of the receiver of this invention first requires a description of a number of typical digital modulation formats. We begin with a generalized definition that includes both amplitude and phase modulation. In connection with the analysis of the operation of this invention and the following explanation, the definitions set forth in Table 9 apply. Consider the real bandpass signal s t having center frequency f Let the generalized spread spectrum signal be the following amplitude and phase modulated analytic signal There are currently four dominant methods of digital modulation involving only the phase term in Eq. 5 i.e., a Equation 5 is then The second type of phase modulation will be referred to as Linear during the symbol time Phase. That is, The third type of modulation will be referred to as Quadratic during the symbol time Phase. That is, Extension of the phase modulation definition to higher orders is clearly possible. However, the above three cover the most popular techniques in use today. The fourth type of phase modulation is actually a combination of the first two, and will be referred to as the Constant Linear Hybrid. For this type, Here we include both the random amplitude and phase terms from Eq. 5 to form the hybrid signal As described above and shown in Fig. 1, the receiver of this invention performs sequential ambiguity transformations by Ambiguity Transform circuits 15 through 15N, one at each receiver stage. We now define the Ambiguity Transform as an operation on the analytic signal µ t Parseval s theorem relates the conjugate product of two waveforms as Another expression for the Ambiguity Transform results from the bandpass nature of the received signal s t and therefore µ t . With only the baseband terms retained, the Ambiguity Transform may be written as The above relationships allow several configurations to be used for the Ambiguity Transform circuits 15 through 15N shown in Fig. 1. The first is derived from the left side of Eq. 19 and is presented in Fig. 2. Now referring to Fig. 2, the band from the Variable Filter 14 of Fig. 1 is introduced on lead 60 into a delay standard 61, while its conjugate is derived in the Conjugate block 80 and the conjugate introduced into a plurality of discrete delays 61a through 61m. In the embodiment of Fig. 2, there are M variable delays, each implemented by one of the M blocks labeled D₁, ..., D Control and timing inputs to the elements of Fig. 2 and succeeding figures are indicated by incoming arrows solid if present in each embodiment of the invention, and dashed if optional or present in a digital embodiment. The second configuration of the Ambiguity Transform is derived from the right side of Eq. 19 , and is shown in Fig. 3, with identical elements bearing the same reference numerals. Here the frequency variable f is discrete since the shift again consists of M values, each implemented by the M delays labeled D₁, ..., D As illustrated in Fig. 4, the third embodiment of the Ambiguity Transform employs M variable time delays 61 through 61m and receives the input signal in parallel. Again, the signal channel through delay 61 constitutes the standard and is introduced into the Frequency Translator 70 before being combined with each of the other channels in Combiners 62a through 62m. The combined outputs are each introduced into respective Filters 71a through 71m and, as in the embodiment of Fig. 2, are introduced as inputs to the Selector 64 and the Fourier Transform or Filter Bank 63, the latter after frequency translation in the Complex Frequency Translator 72. The third configuration of the Ambiguity Transform is again based on the left side of Eq. 19 , but develops the integrand through selected frequency translations and filtering. The input to all M shift delay blocks 61 through 61m is the real bandpass signal s t defined in Eq. 1 . The delay standard block 61 output is then translated in frequency by Δf₁ in the Translator 70, as indicated in Fig. 4. The other M 1 delay block 61a through 61m outputs are combined with the frequency translated reference and filtered in bandpass Filters 71a through 71m to select the difference frequency term. Each of the Filter 71a through 71m outputs is then at a center frequency equal to Δf₁. The in phase and quadrature components of the filter outputs are frequency translated to baseband in the Translator 72, where they are individually fed into a filter bank or Fourier transformed in block 63. This provides each Ambiguity Transform output labeled 1 in Fig. 1. The same Filter 71a through 71m outputs are also translated in frequency and input to the Selector 64. Here, by command from the Timing and Control subsystem 120 of Fig. 1, one or more of the frequency translated signals is selected to form the Ambiguity Transform output labeled 2 in Fig. 1. The fourth configuration of the Ambiguity Transform is based on Eq. 21 , and is shown in Fig. 5. It is similar to the first configuration Fig. 2 , with the exception of the substitution of Signal Conditioner 80 for the Conjugate deriver 80 of Fig. 2. This block forms the analytic signal representation µ t of s t , as required by Eq. 21 . The operation of this fourth embodiment is as described for the first configuration Fig. 2 . A key feature of this invention is the sequential application of the Ambiguity Transforms 15 through 15N, as shown in the system of Fig. 1. The first stage 13 output the Constant Phase Stage is, from Eq. 15 , In general, the output of the N Examination of Eq. 28 shows that each product has N N It is now possible to explain how this invention can produce spectral lines when the input contains members of the class of digitally modulated signals described above. Further, we show the relationships, presented in Table 1, between modulation type and the required number of stages. First consider Constant Phase modulation as defined in Eq. 7 . The output of the first Ambiguity Transform stage is, from Eqs. 7 and 22 , Changing variables under the integral and collecting terms, we have We now consider the shift variable τ ₁ in the range 0 The first is of primary interest and is a deterministic function of the Fourier series kernel At multiples of the symbol rate, G₁ f, τ ₁ ² becomes The second term in Eq. 32 is a function of the random variable ϑ For large values of T In summary, the detection of a spectral line in the first stage Ambiguity Transform output indicates 1 the presence of a Constant Phase digitally modulated signal, 2 the symbol rate clock rate , 3 the relative group delay of the received signal, 4 the phase of the clock, and 5 the received signal center frequency. Proceeding as above, we substitute the Linear Phase signal from Eq. 9 into the expression for two cascaded Ambiguity Transforms given by Eq. 26 . After some manipulation, we have The second, third, and fourth terms are random in either f Upon detection of spectral lines at ℓ T, all the variables in the above expression are known with the exception of α, the received signal group delay. Thus Detection of one or more spectral lines at the output of the second Ambiguity Transform stage therefore indicates, subject to acceptance by the Detection Logic, 1 the presence of a Linear Phase digitally modulated signal, 2 the symbol rate 1 T , and 3 the received signal group delay and clock phase. Proceeding as before, we substitute the Quadratic Phase signal from Eq. 11 into the expression for the third Ambiguity Transform stage output given in Eq. 27 . After considerable manipulation, we have The third Ambiguity Transform stage output is therefore the sum of eight terms, only the first of which is deterministic. For large T Upon detection of spectral lines at ℓ T, all the variables in the above equation are known with the exception of α, the received signal group delay. Then Detection of one or more spectral lines at the output of the third Ambiguity Transform stage therefore indicates, subject to acceptance by the Detection Logic 200, 1 the presence of a Quadratic Phase digitally modulated signal, 2 the symbol rate 1 T , and 3 the received signal group delay and transmitter clock phase. The results derived thus far, combined with the general expression for the N Referring to the expression for the Constant Phase Linear Phase hybrid digitally modulated signal Eq. 13 , and substituting in the equation for the second Ambiguity Transform stage output Eq 26 , we have an expression containing eight summations. These may be treated similarly to the eight summations encountered in the Quadratic Phase analysis, but here the result is that only four index combinations are valid. We order the indices such that the first four n, ℓ₁, ℓ₂, ℓ₃ represent the Constant Phase terms in Eq. 13 , and the last four the Linear Phase terms. We also assume the Linear Phase symbol duration T is greater than that for the Constant Phase T . If the opposite is true, we simply have the noncoherent Linear Phase signal considered earlier. The valid index combinations are shown in Table 4. The resulting four terms in the second stage Ambiguity Transform output are similar to those given in Eq. 46 for a Linear Phase input. However, here the symbol time T is that of the Constant Phase modulation. That is, with the Constant Linear hybrid input, 0 τ ₁ τ ₂ T , and T T, we have spectral lines at multiples of the symbol rate f ℓ T The above results show that the second Ambiguity Transform stage output contains spectral lines when either a Linear Phase signal or a Constant Linear hybrid signal is present at the system input. However, two important characteristics distinguish these two signals. First, the Constant Phase symbol duration T is typically much shorter than that for the Linear Phase e.g., T T The second distinguishing characteristic is found at the output of the first Ambiguity Transform stage when the integration time is specifically set to be less than T but greater than T . Since the integration time is less than the Linear Phase symbol time, spectral energy will be concentrated at f ℓ T , but modulated in amplitude by the integrator at a 1 T rate. These two characteristics, individually or together, distinguish the Constant Linear hybrid from simple Linear Phase modulation. Thus, detection of spectral lines with the above characteristics indicates 1 the presence of the hybrid, 2 the symbol rates 1 T and 1 T , and 3 the relative group delay α. So far we have examined several random phase modulations with a The first term in Eq. 60 becomes We now examine the receiver response to band limited noise. Consistent with the previous definitions, including the analytic representation of input signals, let n t be the analytic signal representation of the noise at the system input. The output of the first stage Ambiguity Transform is then Extension of the above result to the N We next examine the case τ The above τ independence also exists for noise composed of several uncorrelated narrowband signals whose individual bandwidths B The noise power is again independent of τ . This result, combined with that derived for the wideband noise, permits the effective background noise estimation technique used in the receiver of this invention. We have shown that there exist variations in τ to which the noise power is essentially insensitive, but to which the power in the receiver generated spectral lines, due to appropriate signal presence, is very sensitive. This effect is exploited as follows. The Ambiguity Transform output is generated at each stage for two or more values of τ The above process clearly tracks fluctuations in the noise and therefore results in a real time, adaptive detection technique. Significant improvement in the postintegration signal to noise ratio at each receiver stage is obtained by band limiting between stages, as shown in Fig. 1 by the presence of Variable Filters 14 through 14N. Of course, the first stage bandwidth must not be significantly less than the anticipated received signal bandwidth if the signal center frequency is known. If the center frequency is not known the general case , the first stage bandwidth should be larger. Preceding sections have shown that, after the first stage, all terms involving the For example, with τ ₁ τ ₂ 0.1 µsec and τ ₃ 0.8 µsec, and a receiver input s t in Fig. 1 bandwidth of 20 MHz or more, the third stage Variable Filter 14Q in Fig. 1 may have a bandwidth of only 1.8 MHz that is, approximately one tenth that of the receiver input bandwidth. In addition, with R With band limited white noise power density N₀, bandwidth B In Table 6, the term TW is the time bandwidth product of the received signal, and the term SNR Detection and classification of digitally modulated signals with the receiver of this invention involves a search in the sum τ Σ N i Equation 80 shows a logarithmic relationship between the number of required steps in τ and the signal uncertainty. This allows relatively few steps for large T The detection of the presence of hybrid signals, such as Constant Linear Hybrid and Amplitude Phase Hybrid signals, is possible employing this invention. Such detection is accomplished by the processing of the signal path in the circuitry of Fig. 9 following envelope detection in Detectors 20 through 20N of Fig. 1 . Referring now to Fig. 9, it may be seen that the envelope detected signals from Fig. 1 are introduced into a hybrid Signal Selector 150 in which the desired f and τ have been selected. The output of the Signal Selector 150 is Fourier transformed in Fourier Transform or Filter Bank 151 and next compared with a threshold level in hybrid Comparator 152. If the Fourier transformed hybrid signal contents exceed the threshold set, the presence of hybrid modulation is indicated and introduced into the Detection Logic circuit 200 to be verified in accordance with the logic flow diagram of Fig. 8. Figures 10a, 10b, and 10c show the block diagram of an operational system in accordance with this invention. Each of the three drawings depicts a respective stage 213, 230, and 240 corresponding to stages 13, 30, and 40 of Fig. 1. In this case, the band of frequencies to be examined for the presence of signals is introduced at the input port 211 comparable to the antenna 11 of Fig. 1. Where other comparable elements of the system are found in Figs. 10a, 10b, and 10c, they bear reference numerals corresponding to Fig. 1 but in the 200 series. In the case of Fig. 10, the band of frequencies to be examined is conditioned to have a center frequency corresponding to the center frequency of the Bandpass Filter 214, e.g., 6 MHz. Referring to Fig. 10a, the band is thereafter introduced into the three output port 0 phase shift signal Splitter 201. The band from one port is mixed in Mixer 202 with a reference frequency f₀ from a local Oscillator 203 of Fig. 10b over line 204, filtered in Bandpass Filter 205, amplified, and split into signal and noise paths by 0 signal Splitter 206. The incoming signal from Splitter 201 and its frequency shifted counterpart from Splitter 206 are multiplied in Noise Multiplier 207 to provide the noise reference in the noise path through Bandpass Filter 208. This signal is available at Noise PDS jack 209. The third path on lead 210 from Splitter 201 is amplified, fixed delayed, and introduced into a tapped Delay line 217 having a number e.g., 10 of taps from 0 to 1 µsec. A delay selector switch 218 includes a 1 of 10 output port and four BCD control input lines 219 from the selector signal and delay Selector Switch 221 of Fig. 10c. The Selector Switch 218 acts like a rotary switch to select the appropriate delay for the signal path as selected by the BCD code on leads 219. The incoming signal at the selected delay from tapped delay line 217 is amplified and multiplied in Signal Multiplier 227, filtered in Bandpass Filter 228, and available at the signal jack 229. The signal from the Filter 228 is split in three output port 0 Splitter 231 where, after mixing in Mixer 232 with frequency f₁ from local Oscillator 233 of Fig. 10b, it is introduced into the succeeding stage 230 via Bandpass Filter 234. Referring again to the noise path of Fig. 10a, the noise reference is amplified, split in Splitter 235, and mixed in two mixers the I and Q Mixers 236 and 237, respectively , where the noise reference is mixed with a selected frequency from a Frequency Synthesizer 238 under the control of a front panel frequency select switch and represented by Switch 221 over leads 239. The selected frequency, designated F₁, is furnished to both the noise reference channel and the signal channel via Bandpass Filter 241, Splitter 242, and respective signal Splitters 243 and 244, each including one port shifted 90 with respect to the other port to allow the derivation of the in phase I and quadrature Q components of the signal channel content. The noise reference, after mixing in each of the I and Q channels, is low pass filtered, amplified, and squared, then combined in summer 245 to provide a composite noise reference on lead 246. The level of this reference may be read on meter 247 and is introduced into Comparator 248, which has an adjustable threshold under the threshold Select Control 249. Signal information, after processing in an identical manner in the signal channel by mixing in Mixers 260 and 261, is low pass filtered, and squared, then combined in summer 262. The I and Q components of the signal channel are available at jacks 263 and 264, respectively. The Comparator 248 includes an additional input from the signal channel over lead 251. If the signal on lead 251 exceeds the reference signal on lead 246 by the amount of the threshold selected, an indicator lamp 252 is illuminated and a YES NO signal indicates that condition is present at jack 253. The magnitude of the signal i.e., the I The Linear Phase Detector Stage 230 of Fig. 10b is virtually identical with the Constant Phase Detector Stage 213 described above, and comparable elements carry the same reference numerals with a suffix L, similar to Fig. 1. The Synthesizer 238L of the Stage 230 is switchable to frequency F2, which may be different from the frequency F1 of the Stage 213. In operation, the Indicator Lamp 252L will be illuminated whenever the Stage 230 detects the presence of Linear Phase modulation and the magnitude I² Q² is indicated on Meter 254L and available at jack 255L. The Quadratic Phase Detector Stage 240 of Fig. 10c is virtually identical with the previous stages except that it is missing the last frequency converter comparable to Mixers 232 and 232L of the previous stages. The Stage 240 detects the presence of Quadratic Phase modulation, which is indicated by the illumination of lamp 252Q and is displayed in magnitude on Meter 254Q and available at jack 255Q. The input and output frequencies of each stage are the same, allowing the stages to be cascaded and to simultaneously search the input band for different types of modulation. The method of this invention is illustrated not only in the equations set forth above but also in Figs. 6 and 7, which show the signal band processing steps that ensure detection and classification of signals. Figures 6 and 7 show the transformations carried out in each of the cascaded stages as well as the signal form within each stage. We have therefore demonstrated that, by employing our new receiver and method, it is possible to detect and classify signals in a frequency band without advance knowledge of their carrier frequency, modulation type, or modulation rate. After detection, one or many signals in the band may be classified. The method of this invention is carried out through the presence of a novel reference and signal Ambiguity Transform subsystem and the cascading of sections, each of which detects different forms of modulation. The invention is described generally in terms of analog functions however, the processing of signals in digital form in accordance with this teaching is contemplated and fully within the concept of this invention. The foregoing embodiments are merely illustrative of this invention and are not to be considered limiting. Rather, this invention is defined by reference to the following claims, including their equivalents.
