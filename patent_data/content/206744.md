# OPTICAL SENSING OF A SURFACE

## Abstract
To locate the upper surface of an object 18 on a substrate 20 , a first real image of a Ronchi ruling parallel bars 22 is projected by an objective lens 16 and moved into coincidence with the upper surface by vertical movement of a video camera 10 to which the ruling 22 and lens 16 are fixed. The video camera sensor 12 performs line scanning perpendicular to the bars of a second real image of the ruling 22 formed by the lens 16 projecting light reflected up by the upper surface. Accurate coincidence of the first real image with the upper surface provides a camera output signal containing a strong component at a frequency determined by the spatial frequency of the image scanned and the line scan frequency. Measure ment of the vertical position of the camera 10 and sensing of several surface provides signals which can be digitally processed to give data on the structure of, for example, a small manufactured article.
