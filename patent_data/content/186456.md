# Manufacturing of high molecular weight polyester.

## Abstract
A polybutylene terephthalate is manufactured by the steps of polycondensating in the liquid phase terephthalic acid, or a lower alcohol ester thereof, as the acid component, and 1,4 butanediol as the diol component, to obtain a prepolymer of polybutylene terphthatate, solidifying the prepolymer, and further polymerizing the prepolymer in the solid phase to obtain a polybutyrene terephthalate of a higher polymerization degree, 0.001 to 5 by weight, based on the prepolymer, of a nucleator being added to the polymerization mixture, at any time during or following the monomer mixing stage and before the start of the solid phase polymerization, the solid phase pelymerization being conducted in the presence of the nucleator uniformly dispersed in the polymerization mixture.
