# Dispersion of magnetic particles.

## Abstract
A dispersion of finely divided particles of a magnetic material in an organic liquid containing a dispersant com prising an amine carrying a poly carbonylalkyleneoxy chain PCAO chain in which the alkylene groups contain up to 8 carbon atoms, or an acid salt thereof. The dispersion is useful for the preparation of magnetic recording media such as video, audio and computer recording tapes and discs. Certain of the dispersants are novel, especially a polyethyleneimine carrying at least two PCAO chains.
