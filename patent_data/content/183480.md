# Dispersions of water insoluble photographic addenda.

## Abstract
Liquid petroleum sulphonates are useful, on their own or with less lipophilic anionic surfactants, in the preparation of dispersions of water insoluble photographic addenda such as couplers and ultraviolet absorbers in hydrophilic colloid compositions. Crystallisation of the addenda is inhibited and, for some addenda, other advantages are obtained.
