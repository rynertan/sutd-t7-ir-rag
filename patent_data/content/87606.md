# Magnetic recording device having multichannel head.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a magnetic recording device for recording or playing back television image and audio signals onto or from a magnetic tape T in a VTR, and is so constructed that multichannel heads A, B in the VTR are disposed in the maximum integral number which is not greater than the ration P C between the track pitch P of the multichannel head and the track width C of each head chip A₁, A₂, A₃, A₄ B₁, B₂, B₃, B₄ constituting the multichannel head. This has realized a very high recording density of the magnetic tape.

## Description
Title of the Invention Magnetic Recording Device having Multichannel Head Background of the Invention The present invention relates to a magnetic recording device characterized by the arrangement scheme of multichannel heads for recording or playing back television image and audio signals in a video tape recorder hereinafter, abbreviated to VTR . In a VTR for domestic use, magnetic heads A andB have heretofore been installed on a rotary drum 1 as shown in Figure 1 a . A magnetic tape T, which travels in the direction of an arrow, is obliquely scanned by the magnetic heads A and B, thereby to record or play back television signals. At this time, one traceA or B Figure l b obliquely scanned by the magnetic head corresponds to one field of the television signal. An FM modulation system has hitherto been employed for such recording and playback of the television signals.Recently, the use of a PCM system has been attempted for attaining a high picture quality of playback images.When the television signals are put into PCM codes, they become a large quantity of high speed data equal to about 100 Nb s. The data cannot be recorded or played back by a VTR having only one magnetic head, such as the conventional VTR of the analog system. This is because the limitations of the recording performances of magnetic heads and magnetic tapes in the present situation make it difficult to record and play back such large quantity of high speed data. It is accordingly necessary to divide the PCM data so as to lower the bit rate, and to record or play back the television signal into or from a plurality of tracks by the use of a multichannel head having a plurality of head chips. Regarding the multichannel head which is used for such purpose, it is desirable for the enhancement of a recording area density on .a tape that the distances of the respective head chips A1, A2 and A3 of the multichannel head illustrated in Figure 2 are as small as possible.In actuality, however, the distances D between the adjacent head chips A1, A2 and A3 must be set at a very large value with respect to the width C of each head chipA1, A2 or A3 equal to a track width which is recorded by each head chip . The reason is that a space for inserting a magnetic shielding material is secured in order to prevent the crosstalk of signals attributed to the magnetic leakage between the respectively adjacent head chips. Thus, the recording and playback with such multichannel head involves the disadvantage that the storage density lowers. There has also been known a system wherein respective head chips are mounted in staggered fashion so that the spacings between tracks depicted by the adjacent head chips may become substantially zero. However, it has the disadvantage that the mounting adjustments of the respective head chips are difficult, so a high precision is difficult to be attained. Summary of the Invention The present invention has been made in view of such problems, and consists in that the number of multichannel heads to be arranged is determined according to the head chip width df the multichannel head and the distance between the head chips, whereby an enhanced recording density is attained.

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments of the Invention Now, an embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to Figures 3, 4 and 5. In Figure 3, multichannel heads 4 and B are installed on a drum 1 which rotates by t revolutions per second.Each multichannel head A or B has head chips A1, A2,A3 and A4 or B1, B2, B3 and B4 stacked into a multiple layer. The multichannel heads in Figure 3 illustrate a scheme in the case where the heads A and B are arranged at the opposing positions of the drum 1 0 180 0 as in Figure 1 and where the angle of winding wrap angle of a tape T with respect to the drum 1 is also 180 O, When the multichannel heads A and B have scanned the magnetic tape T to record a television signal, the traces of tracks become as shown in Figure 4.The chip width of each of the head chips A1, A2, A3 and A4 and B1,B2, B3 and B4 of the respective heads A and B is C, and also the width of each of the track traces A11, A2 , A and A41 and B111 B2 , B31 and B41 thereof becomesC. The signal of a certain specified n th field Fna which constitutes the television signal, is recorded by the multichannel head A.Subsequently, when the drum rotates over a rotational angle ss of 180 , the multichannel head B records the signal of an n l th field Fn l this time, the speed S of the magnetic tape T is controlled so that an area on the magnetic tape T shifting by E of the n th field in may become the n l th field. Moreover, in order to prevent the traces of the head B from overlapping those of the head A, a step is provided so that the head B may become lower in height than the head A by h. Therefore, the trace B1 of the head chip of the head B just fits in between the traces 3 and A4 depicted by the head chips of the head A. In an n 2 th field, the traces of the television signal by the head A are similarly recorded in succession. There will be stated conditions under which the trace of one multichannel head just fits in the interspaceD between the traces of the other head in this manner, so that the ideal high density recording and playback without any vacant space are permitted. Now, the tape is traveling at the fixed speed S cm sec3. The drum 1 rotates by t revolutions per second. The heights of the multichannel heads A and B each having m channels are supposed to be H. The speed is controlled so that, when the head A has effected one revolution, the traces Fun 1 on the tape T may adjoin the traces Fn before the revolution. At this time, the following equation holds S E b sir. 6 P.m.t.sin 0 C D .m.t.sin 0t 1 where P denotes the track pitch C and 6 denotes the angle defined between the traveling direction of the tape and the trace of the track. It is supposed that such multichannel heads numbering n are arranged on the drum 1 equiangularly in the rotating direction thereof. Herein, the following equation needs to hold in order that the trace of the head chip of one multichannel head may fall in the interspace between the traces depicted by the head chips of the other multichannel heads P D C n ..... 2 C C n integer of at least 2.Further, the steps h between the respective multichannel heads become h j P k P ..... 3 j any integer, k integer 1 k n. Although the above has referred to the case where the multichannel heads are arranged equiangularly, it is not always necessary to equiangularly install the heads on the drum. Even when the heads are not arranged equiangularly, the relationship of Equation 2 holds. Regarding the steps, Equation 3 does not hold. Essentially, however, the multichannel heads may be positioned by adjusting their steps in order that their traces may be recorded on the tape T in interpolating fashion without any overlap. Figure 5 shows an electric circuit which supplies the television signal TVS to the multichannel heads.The analog signal TVS is converted into a digital signal by an analog to digital converter 51. Numeral 52 designates a serial to parallel converter, owing to which the signalTVS has the respective fields turned into parallel digital signals in succession. Subsequently, the digital signals are converted by modulators 53 into a signal form suited to a magnetic recording system. Thereafter, the respective fields are selected by switches 54 so as to be supplied to the heads A1, A2, A3, A4 and B1, B2, B3, B4. As set forth above, the present invention is so constructed that n multichannel heads with which the relationship between the width C of a track depicted by each head chip and the distance D belveen tracks becomesP C n are installed on a drum. Therefore, it has the effect of enhancing the recording density of a magnetic tape.
