# Driving circuit for brushless DC motors.

## Abstract
A driving circuit for a brushless DC motor having a small amount of torque ripple comprises a magnetic pole position detecting circuit 110 for detecting positions of magnetic poles of a rotor magnet 9 for delivering polyphase signals indicating the positions, a rectifier adder circuit 40 for producing a sum of positive or negative portions of the polyphase signals from the magnetic pole position detecting circuit 110 , a first error amplifier 50 for adjusting a gain of the magnetic pole position detecting circuit 110 to make an output signal of the rectifier adder circuit 40 to be proportional to an instruction signal, a power supply circuit 101, 102, 103 for supplying currents to armature coils 4, 5, 6 in response to the polyphase signals, a modulating signal producing circuit 120 for producing a modulating signal synchronised with the rotation of the motor, and a second error amplifier 70 for adjusting a gain of the power supply circuit 101, 102, 103 to make the currents supplied to the armature coils 4, 5, 6 to be proportional to the modulating signal.
