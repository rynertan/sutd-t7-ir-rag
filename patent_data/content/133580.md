# Permanent magnet synchronous motor control system.

## Abstract
A resolver is mounted on the rotating shaft of a motor under control. Two carriers having a 90 degree phase difference are supplied to the resolver causing the resolver to produce a phase signal having a phase proportional to the angle of rotation of the controlled motor. At a phase detector, the two phase carriers are subjected to detection by the above stated phase signals to form phase detection signals and wave form converters continuously convert these phase detection signals into voltage signals. At the same time, a deviation signal generating part, forms a deviation signal representative of a difference between the phase signal of the resolver and a control command phase signal. Multi pliers multiply the two phase continuous voltage signals by the deviation signal and produce multiplication signals. The multiplication signals are applied via a two phase to three phase converting circuit to a motor driving circuit thereby controlling the speed and position of the motor.
