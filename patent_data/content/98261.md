# Method of producing a vanadium and nitrogen containing material for use as an addition to steel.

## Abstract
A method for producing a vanadium and nitrogen containing material V₂N in which nitrogen gas is introduced into a furnace containing a mixture of V₂O₃ and carbon in stoichiometric proportion while simultaneously maintaining the temperature in the furnace in a range of from about 1000 C. to 1500 C. under a reduced pressure in the range of from about 5 mm to 100 microns.
