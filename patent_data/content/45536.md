# A multi component delivery apparatus.

## Abstract
The apparatus consists of a plurality of piston pumps 12,20 having preset displacement ratios. Motor means 14,22 are connected to each of said pumps. In addition, there is a synchronizing means 30 connected to each pump ensuring that all pistons execute their previous stroke completely before being reversed and that they all start their following stroke at exactely the same moment. Further more there is a speed control means 32 connected to the pumps controlling the speed of each piston so that all pistons complete their respective strokes simultaneously. A means for adjusting and varying the pump displacement is also provided. Measured amounts of the components leav ing each of said pumps are coupled to an in line mixing means. The apparatus may be adjusted to different volumetric ratios with relativ ease. It utilizes widely available off the shelf components and can be broken down into independent and individual operating units. The actuating and control medium may be compressed air. The apparatus is used, besides others, to apply two component materials with the airless spray method.
