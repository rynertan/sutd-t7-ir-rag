# Method of supplying heat to high temperature process streams.

## Abstract
A petroleum process stream is heated by injecting an oxygen containing gas into the stream to cause partial combustion and a rise in temperature. The process is particularly useful in delayed coking and visbreaking although it may also be used for other processes operating at elevated temperatures such as fluid catalytic cracking. It is of particular utility with processes such as delayed coking where fouling of the preheater tubes has been a problem, since the furnace may be operated at a lower temperature with the feed being brought to the final reaction temperature by combustion. Thermal efficiency is increased since heat transfer occurs directly and the injected oxidant and the combustion products help to strip volatile cracked products from the coking drum. Decreased fouling enables higher coker temperatures to be used, with consequent improvements in the yield of cracked products and a decrease in the yield of coke.

## Description
METHOD OF SUPPLYING HEAT TO HIGH TEMPERATURE PROCESS STREAMS This invention relates to a method for supplying heat to high temperature process streams and more particularly, to a method for supplying heat to petroleum feedstocks which are to be processed in thermal conversion processes such as visbreaking, thermal cracking and coking. In the refining of crude petroleum, many processes are carried out at elevated temperatures and some of them are quite high even by the standards of petroleum refining. For example, various thermal conversion processes such as visbreaking, thermal cracking and coking in which a bulk conversion of the feedstock is brought about by the influence of temperature, are carried out at temperatures which are usually above 400 C 750 F . In processes of this kind, the feedstock is usually heated by being passed through heating coils in a fumace which brings the feedstock up to the temperature required for the process.One problem which is encountered in high temperature operations of this kind is that the feedstock may undergo thermal cracking in the fumace with result tant fouling of the furnace tubes, necessitating a large amount of downtime for removal of deposits.The uncontrolled cracking which takes place in this way also tends to reduce the yields of desired products. This is a particular problem in coking which is one of the highest temperature operations encountered in current refinery practice where a high temperature of 450 to 500 C 840 to 9300F is required in the coke drum, necessitating a furnace outlet temperature of 500 to 6000C 930 to lilooF . However, in practice, the maximum temperature in the coke drum is determined by the furnace discharge temperature which, in turin, is currently limited by the extent of coking which can be accepted in the furnace tubes.One method for inhibiting the degree of coking is to include an inert gas, generally steam, in the feedstock as it is passed through the tubes so as to increase the velocity of the oil in the tube and reduce its residence time, thereby reducing the extent of crack ing which occurs in the tubes of the furnace. In addition, the steam helps to strip volatile material from the coke in the coking drum. Similarly, in soaker type visbreaker units, the furnace tubes may be subjected to an undesirable degree of coking because of the long residence times which are encountered in these units.Thus, the seat of the problem has generally been in the furnace where the objective has been to supply the required heat to the process stream without, however, employing conditions which are conducive to the production of quantities of coke and other thermal decomposition products. To avoid the temperature limitations of delayed coking units, both moving bed and fluidized bed units have been proposed for reduced crude coking. Because units of this kind generally operate at lower pressures and higher temperatures than delayed cokers, more of the feedstock is vaporized and the higher temperatures also result in higher octane gasoline and more olefin gasoline than those from delayed cokers. However, despite the development of these higher temperature coking processes, most commercial coking operations currently employ the delayed coking process. Various proposals have therefore been made for addressing the problems of furnace fouling in coking operations with the objective of continuing the utility of current delayed cokers. For example,U.S. Patent No. 4,302,324 discloses a method for increasing the temperature of the coker feedstock by adding hot coke to the feed which is charged to the coking drum. In this way, the furnace is permitted to operate at a relatively lower temperature, with reduced fouling in the furnace tubes. With a different objective in mind, U.S. Patent No.2,775,549 discloses a coking operation in which additional heat may be supplied by introducing a superheated steam or relatively light hydrocarbon or steam directly into the coke still. In a similar manner, U.S. Patent No. 3,956,101 describes a method for producing coke by a two step operation in which the feedstock is first subjected to reforming and then to coking in a coking drum with a superheated nonoxidizing gas being injected into the bottom of the drum in order to bring the oil to the desired coking temperature. Suitable nonoxidizing gases include the vapors of light hydrocarbon oils or gases such as hydrogen, nitrogen and steam, all of which are required to be nonoxidizing at the temperatures used in the process. It has now been found that process streams, particularly refinery process streams which are to be brought to high temperatures, may be effec tively heated by a process of direct, intemal combustion, which reduces the need for supplying heat in preheating fumaces and may, in favorable cases, totally eliminate the requirement for such fumaces. Accordingly the present invention provides a method for processing petroleum at an elevated temperature in which the petroleum is heated, characterized by heating the petroleum by injecting an oxygencontaining gas into it to cause a partial combustion of the petroleum. In the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 is a simplified diagramatic representation of a delayed coking unit employing oxygen injection in the coking drum Figure 2 is a simplified diagramatic representation of a delayed coking unit employing oxygen injection in a combustion vessel outside the coking drum Figure 3 is a simplified diagramatic representation of a delayed coking unit employing oxygen injection in the coking drum without a preheating furnace and Figure 4 is a simplified diagramatic representation of a soaker visbreaker unit employing oxygen injection into the visbreaker. In the present process, the heat content of a combustible process stream, for example, a hydrocarbon process stream in a petroleum refinery, is increased by injecting an oxygen containing gas into the stream so that combustion of a part of the process stream occurs directly in the stream. The heat from the exothermic combustion reaction is transferred directiy to the process stream so that a rise in temperature of the stream takes place and this enables the requirement for externally supplied heat to be reduced. Thus, in operations such as coking and visbreaking, the amount of heat which needs to be supplied in the preheater furnace is reduced and, in favorable cases, it may be possible to eliminate the preheating furnace entirely.Because the amount of heat which is to be supplied by the furnace is decreased, the furnace may be operated under lower severity conditions, i.e. at lower temperatures, or with a reduced furnace residence time, so that the extent of thermal decempo sition which takes place in the furnace is reduced and internal fouling of the furnace tubes is reduced or eliminated. The process stream will generally be selected from petroleum feedstock such as gas oil, vacuum reduced crudes, atmospheric residua, heavy cycle oils, slurry oils, FCC tower bottoms, thermal cracking residua and products from synthetic liquid fuel production, for example, heavy fractions from Fischer Tropsch syntheses. In principal, the process may be applied to the heating of any combustible process stream whose temperature is to be raised for a subsequent processing step but obviously, it will not be used under circumstances where there might be a hazard of uncontrolled combustion or explosion.The process is particularly applicable for heating petroleum refinery streams which are to be heated to temperatures above 400 C 750 F and more particularly, for such streams which are to be heated to temperatures above 450 C 8400F , e.g.to temperatures of 500 C 930 F , 525 C 980 F or even higher. Thus, the method will be particularly applicable with thermal conversion processes such as coking, especially delayed coking, thermal cracking and visbreaking. By thermal conversion is meant a process in which a hydrocarbon feedstock is converted at least in part to products of lower boiling range solely by the influence of eie vated temperature, i.e. is noncatalytic in nature.However, the method may also be used to heat process streams which are going to nonhydrogenative catalytic processes such as fluid catalytic cracking FCC . In these processes, the process stream may be brought to a higher temperature than the furnace temperature by the injection of the oxygen containing gas. An illustrative process scheme for heating a heavy oil coker feedstock is shown in Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings. In Figure 1, the heavy oil feed, together with any recycle optional enters through conduit 10 together with any steam which is desired for stripping purposes. The feed is heated in preheater furnace 11 and then passes to coking drum 12 in which coking takes place. Oxygen is injected at the bottom of drum 12 through injection nozzle 13 at a rate which is proportioned in accordance with the charge rate of the feedstock to the coker drum. As the oxygen comes into contact with the heated feed, combustion occurs to the extent permitted by the quantity of oxygen injected and the heat of the combustion is released to the feed as it passes up the coker drum, with a resulting increase in temperature.In this way, coking may be carried out at the requisite coking temperature, typically at 4500C 840 F or higher, although temperatures within the range of 450 to 47soy 840 to 9000F will normally be used. Because of the heat released by the combustion of the hydrocarbon feed in the coker drum itseif, the discharge temperature of the preheater furnace may be maintained at a lower value, typically 400 to 425do 750 to 800 F . The use of lower temperatures in the furnace reduces the degree of furnace fouling and it is therefore possible to operate over longer periods of time without the necessity of cleaning the inside of the furnace tubes. A similar arrangement is shown in Figure 2 in which a heavy hydrocarbon feedstock is preheated in a furnace together with any recycle and added steam for stripping. In this case, oxygen is injected into the feed in a combustion vessel 15 between furnace 11 and coking drum 12. Partial combustion of the feedstock takes place as in the previous arrangement, with a similar resulting rise in temperature. It will also permit the coker to be operated at higher temperatures so as to increase liquid yield. As shown in Tables 1 and 2 below, increasing the temperature at which coking or visbreaking is carried out, increases the liquid yields.

From these results, it is apparent that in ther mal processing operations of this kind it is often desirable to operate at higher temperatures. How ever, in conventional practice, the limitations on furnace operation may prevent the use of the tem peratures which would otherwise be desirabie. The use of the present heating method enables such limitations to be overcome since the processing may be carried out at temperatures higher than the furnace outlet temperature. Furthermore, greater flexibility of operation is provided since the operat ing temperature can be varied simply by adjusting the injection rate of the oxidant gas. As previously mentioned, it may in favorable cases be possible to dispense with the preheating furnace, especially when the feed can be heated by heat exchange with the conversion products. InFigure 3, a heavy oil feed together with any op tional recycle enters the unit through conduit 10 and stripping steam is injected at this point. Con duit 10 conducts the feed and steam through heat exchanger 16 where they pick up heat from the vaporous products of the coking process which leave coking drum 12 through conduit 17. The feed enters the bottom of coking drum 12 in the normal way and oxygen is injected through an injection nozzle 13, as in Figure 1. In the visbreaking unit shown in Figure 4, the visbreaker feed, usually a vacuum residuum or possibly a full range heavy crude, topped heavy crude or atmospheric residuum, enters through conduit 20 and oxygen is injected through a suit able nozzle at 21. A requisite residence time is provided by the length of conduit 22 before a gas oil quench is introduced at 23, after which the visbreaking products pass to flash drum 24. From flash drum 24 the gaseous products pass to fractionator 25 to give the lighter products such as gas, gasoline and light gas oil the liquid fraction from flashdrum 24 passes to vacuum tower 26 to separate the heavy gas oil fraction HGO from the visbroken residuum. In order to ensure that combustion takes place in a hydrocarbon process stream, it is desirable either prior to or subsequent to the injection of oxygen, that the hydrocarbons should be brought to a temperature which is at least as high as the flashpoint of at least one of the hydrocarbons in the stream. Once combustion has been initiated by one of the more volatile hydrocarbons, it will generally continue to the extent permitted by the available oxygen. Thus, in the arrangement of Figures 1 and 2, the heavy oil feed should be heated to a temperature in the furnace which is at least equal to the flashpoint of at least one of the hydrocarbons in the oil. As an alternative, the oxygen could be dispersed into the stream prior to the furnace or the preheat exchanger so that spontaneous combustion would occur once the flashpoint is reached.To guarantee complete combustion, a promoter may be added to the oil or a chamber holding a combustion catalyst may be inserted after the preheat furnace or the preheat exchanger. The use of promotors and combustion catalysts is especially desirable in cases where the presence of the oxygen containing gas might be deleterious to the subsequent processing step. Oxygen is the preferred oxygen containing gas for use in this method since it readily initiates spontaneous ignition. Air is somewhat less preferred since the nitrogen which is present in it adds to the amount of gas which requires to be accommodated in the downstream process unit but it is, of course, considerably cheaper. As a compromise, oxygen enriched air may be used and in such cases, an oxygen concentration of at least 75 by volume is normally preferred. The amount of the oxygen containing gas which is to be injected will depend upon a number of factors including the temperature rise which is to be achieved, the heat of combustion of the particular process stream, the composition of the oxygencontaining gas and the amount of any steam or other inert material which is present. The actual amount necessary may be determined by calculation from the known values of the appropriate factors or by experiment. Generally, the amount of oxygen necessary for thermal processing of petroleum residua will be from 4 to 70 Kg oxygen per 1000 Kg of oil if steam is present as a stripper, an additional 2 to 40 Kg of oxygen should be used for every 1000 Kg of steam. As well as supporting combustion in the oil, the oxidant gas and the combustion products act as a stripper, maintaining oil velocities in the conduits and in the rest of the processing equipment. Because of this, the amount of injected steam may be reduced or, in favorable cases, eliminated. For this reason, it may be preferred to operate with injection of the oxygen upstream of the preheat furnace or the preheat exchanger so that a limited degree of combustion occurs as the oil passes through the heater the gaseous combustion products reduce the space velocity of the oil in the heater with a consequent reduction in the likelihood of fouling.
