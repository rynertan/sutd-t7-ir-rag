# METHOD OF MANUFACTURING SEMICONDUCTOR LASER DEVICES.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing semiconductor laser devices utilized in various kinds of communication systems. In the course of realizing semiconductor laser devices having a construction in which a heat sink 23 made of diamond or the like is placed on a heat radiating stud 21 which is a part of a sealed container for a semiconductor laser element 21 , with the semiconductor laser element 21 being disposed on the heat sink 23 , the method of manufacturing the laser device comprises the following steps providing a layer of gold alloy 36 on the surface of the heat sink 23 , placing the semiconductor laser element 24 on the layer of gold alloy 36 at a temperature below the eutectic point, heating the entire device at a temperature above the eutectic point, and cooling it thereby fixing the semiconductor laser element 24 onto the heat sink 23 . The semiconductor laser devices manufactured by this method have a long life.
