The latter may be, for example, a 1 40 g 100 ml solution of the compound in a non toxic organic solvent containing an emulsifying agent, and this may be diluted with water to give a concentration of the compound in the aqueous medium of from 0.01 to 0.5 w v g 100 ml , or approximately 100 to 5000 p.p.m. Suitable solvents include toluene, xylene and petroleum oil or an alkylated naphthalene. The volatile solvents, e.g. toluene and xylene, evaporate after spraying to.leave a deposit of the active ingredient. Suitable emulsifiers, which can be cationic, anionic or non ionic as is well known to those skilled in the art, include ordinary soaps anionic , la uryl pyridinium chloride cationic and polyoxyethylene lauryl ethers non ionic , the latter being, for example, a reaction product of ethylene oxide 10 moles with dodecyl alcohol 1 mole . The madeup spray or dip may be an emulsion or suspension. A dust may be made by mixing the appropriate amount of active ingredient with a diluent or carrier such as talc, clay, calcite, pyrophyllite, diatomaceous earth, walnut shell flour, silica gel, hydrated alumina or calcium silicate to afford a concentration of active ingredient of from about 0.25 to about 4 by weight. As an alternative method of preparation, the diluent or carrier is mixed with a solution of the active ingredient in a volatile organic solvent, e.g. benzene or acetone. The solvent is then removed by evaporation and the mixture ground. Wettable powders may be made by adding suitable wetting agents and conditioning agents to the dusts. They may suitably contain from about 25 to about 75 w v of active ingredient. For the control of nuisance flies breeding in dung, the compounds may be incorporated into the animal feed. Administration in the form of prolonged release formulations is also possible. The compounds may also be administered in combination with a conventional ectoparasiticidal agents such as organophosphates, carbamates, organochlorines, pyrethroids, formamidines, triazapentadienes, triazinethiones or thioureas. In one test 2 4 day old females of the World HealthOrganisation standard fully susceptible strain of Musca domestica common housefly are anaesthetised with carbon dioxide and then each contacted on the dorsal surface of the thorax with one microgram of the test compound contained in 1 microlitre of solution, using e.g. acetone, methanol or methyl ethyl ketone as the solvent.The flies are then maintained for 24 hours in gauze covered pots at 250C and at about 50 relative humidity with a cotton wool pad moistened with sugar solution as a source of food placed on the gauze. Contacted with an equivalent volume of solvent only are the same number of anaesthetised control flies. At the end of the 24 hours period the mortality is noted and recorded as z percentage, after correction for any mortality amongst the controls.The result gives a measure of the effectiveness of the test compound applied topically In order to test the effectiveness of the compounds when used as bait for adult blow flies, two groups of adult female Lucilia sericata or cuprina are maintained for 24 hours in pots each containing sugar and a pad of wet cotton wool as a free water supply, one of the sugar supplies being impregnated with test compound to the extent of 100 p.p.m. The mortality is noted as in the previous test and recorded as a corrected percentage. Larvicidal properties are investigated by maintaining test and control groups of Lucilia sericata or cuprina blowfly larvae in separate test tubes, each containing filter paper partially soaked in calf serum serving as food and plugged with cotton wool. The filter paper in the test tube containing the test larvae is additionally imprognated with the compound under investigation to the extent of a 100 mg mê deposition. Both test tabes are Stored with the top part only in a strong light so as to induce the larvae to stay in the lower part of the tubes in contact with the filter paper through exploitation of their aversion to light. As in previous tests, mortality is noted and recorded as a corrected percentage. The finding of substantial numbers of test larvae on the illuminated plug suggests that the test compound has marked repellant properties. In addition to percentage effectiveness figures, LD90 results can be obtained from dose response measurenients using any of the afore described tests. The compounds of the formula I in which X is S, except those in which R is an aryl, heteroaryl, or heteroaryl phenyl group, have acaricidal and miticidal properties. To assess acaricidal activity, in one test, five freshly collected, fully engorged Boophilus microplus adult female ticks are used for each acaricidal compound. Using a micro pipette 10 microlitres of a solution containing 10 micro grams of the acaricidal compound in ethanol or acetone, is applied to the dorsal surface of each of the ticks. The treated ticks are placed in weighed 1 x 2 glass vials, weighed and stored at 260C and 80 R.H. in plastic boxes for two weeks. The ticks are then removed from the vials and the vials weighed to give the weight of eggs laid by the ticks. Any reduction in the egg laying of the treated ticks is calculated as a percentage of the eggs laid by untreated control ticks. The eggs are returned to the incubator for a further 3 weeks after which time the percentage of eggs hatching is estimated. The percentage reduction in the anticipated reproduction of the ticks is calculated using the weight of eggs laid and the percentage of eggs hatching. The test may be repeated using smaller amounts of the acaricidal compound. In another test, using a pipette 0.5 ml of a solution containing 0.5 mg of the acaricidal compound in ethanol or acetone is spread evenly on to a Whatman No. 1 filter paper 8 cm x 6.25 cm 50 2 sq. c.m. to give a dosage of 100 mg m The treated paper is allowed to dry at room temperature, folded with the treated surface inside and the two short edges sealed with a crimping machine. The open ended envelope is placed in a llbKilner jar containing damp cotton wool in a plastic pot and stored in an incubator at 260C for 24 hours. 20 50 Boophilus microplus larvae, which had hatched 8 14 days previously, are placed in the envelope using a small spatula. The open end is then crimped to form a sealed packet. The treated paper containing the larvae is returned to the Kilner jar and kept for a further 48 hours in the incubator. 20 50 larvae are placed similarly in an untreated paper envelope to act as controls. At the end of the 48 hour test period the mortality is noted and recorded as a percentage after correction for any mortality among the untreated control ticks. The test may be repeated using smaller amounts of the acaricidal compound. In addition to percentage effectiveness figures, LDg0 results can be obtained from dose response measurements using any of the aforedescribed tests. Activity against Haemaphysalis longicornus nymphs may be measured in a similar manner to the above larvae test. In order to test the compounds for insect growth regulant activity, 24 hour old Musca domestica housefly larvae are added to a nutrient gel impregnated with the test compound at a dose concentration of 100 pg ml. A typical nutrient gel consists of agar 10 gm., dessicated yeast 50 gm., skimmed milk powder 50 gm, and water 500 ml.Assessment of the activity is made by observing larval growth at 24 hours and 5 days and comparing state with that of the controls.Pupal state is observed and pupae counted on day 12. Eclosed flies are counted on day 20 and results are calculated against control figures. A compound giving 100 kill is further tested by dose response. The test may also be carried out in a similar fashion using Lucilia sericata sheep blowfly larvae. The compounds of the invention may be prepared by a number of routes, including the following 1 The compounds of the formula I in which X is S may be prepared by the following reaction scheme EMI13.1 Preferably the bromo derivative is used. In a typical procedure the halo thiophenesulphonamide in a suitable solvent, e.g. anhydrous ether, at a low temperature not more that 60 C and under a dry nitrogen atmosphore, has added to it the n butyllithium or ther alkyllithium at such a rate that the internal temperature does not exceed 60 C. After stirring for a short period of time, the disulphide is added and the reaction mixture is then allowed to warm to room temperature. The resulting product may then be isolated and purified by conventional procedures. 2 The compounds of the formula I in which X is S or 0 and R is an aryl or heteroaryl group may be prepared by the following reaction scheme EMI14.1 pBal Br, C1, The preferred base solvent combination when X is S is dimethylformamide NaOH H2O, and when X is 0, hexamethylphosphoric triamide anhydrous potassium carbonate. Typically the reactants are heated together in the base solvent mixture at from 60 1300C under an atmosphere of nitrogen until the reaction is substantially complete, e.g. for from 5 24 hours. The product may then be isolated and purified by conventional procedures. 3 The compounds of the formula I in which Rê is other than an aryl group, and in which RÚ and Rê do not form a ring, may be prepared as follows EMI15.1 CHal Br, C1, I7 P 2. group otherwise Bal is genexally Br. In a typical procedure a solution of the reactants in a suitable solvent, e.g. dimethylformamide, and in the presence of a base,e.g. sodium hydride, is stirred at room temperature 20 C for a few hours, although in some cases heating may be necessary, e.g. to 700C, to accelerate the reaction. The product may then be isolated and purified by conventional methods. 4 The compounds of the formula I in which R is a lower alkyl group may be prepared as follows EMI15.2 The reaction may be carried out in a similar manner to 3 above. Similarly compounds in which both RÚ and Rê are lower alkyl groups may be prepared as follows EMI15.3 Generally a slight excess of the lower alkyl halide, i.e.more than 2 equivalents, is used. Wnen X is SO2 and R is R NH , then trialkylation may occur to giveEMI16.1 when an excess of alkylating agent is used. 5 The compounds of the formula I in which X is S may beEMI16.2 When R in R.Hal is an aryl group, generally a strongly electron withdrawing substituent e.g. NO2 must be present in the meta or para position to the halogen atom Hal . Sometimes an electron withdrawing substituent is similarly necessary when R is heteroaryl. The reaction is typically carried out by reacting the halothiophenesulphonamide, which is preferably the bromothiophene sulphonamide, in a suitable solvent, e.g. anhydrous ether, with the n butyllithium at a low temperature, generally below 600C.Approximately one equivalent of sulphur is then added and the mixture stirred at this temperature for about an hour. After allowing the reaction mixture to warm to room temperature, the solvent is removed in vacuo and the resulting solid taken up in a suitable solvent, e.g.anhydrous dimethylformamide. The compound R.Hal is then added and the mixture stirred at room temperature for up to about 24 hours.The product may then be isolated and purified by conventional procedures. 6 Compounds of the formula I in which X is SO can be prepared by the controlled oxidation of the corresponding compounds in which X is S. In a typical procedure, the appropriate compound in which X is S, in a suitable solvent, e.g. dichloromethane, is refluxed with about one equivalent of m chloroperbenzoic acid for a few hours, e.g. for up to 5 hours. The product may then be isolated and purified by conventional procedures. 7 Compounds of the formula I in which X is SO2 can be prepared by the oxidation of the corresponding compounds in which X is S. This is typically carried out by oxidizing the starting material with an excess of hydrogen peroxide in glacial acetic acid under reflux for a few hours, e.g. for up to 5 hours. Again the product may then be isolated and purified by conventional procedures. 8 Compounds of the formula I can also be prepared as follows EMI17.1 Generally the reaction is carried out at room temperature or lower in an inert organic solvent, e.g. dichloromethane. The product may be recovered by conventional procedures. The starting materials may be prepared as follows EMI17.2 9 The following route was also useful in a particularEMI18.1 The details are given in Example 226. 10 Certain compounds of the invention may be prepared from other compounds of the invention as follows Compounds in which Y is R s , lower alkyl, tri ower alkyl silyl or halogen may be prepared by the electrophilic substitution of the corresponding compound in which Y is H, e.g.using trimethylsilylchloride,EMI18.2 CH3Si, CH3I, Br2 or Br CH2 2Br. t the use of Br CH212Br resulted in bromination3. Compounds in which Y is alkoxyphenyl or aryloxyphenyl may be prepared by the reaction of the corresponding hydroxyphenyl compound with the appropriate alkyl or aryl halide in the presence of a base, e.g. K2C03. The aryl halide preferably has a strong electron withdrawing substituent, e.g. nitro, in the m or pposition. Compounds having a phenyl group substituted by N lower alkyl carbamoyloxy may be prepared by the reaction of the corresponding hydroxy substituted compound with a lower alkyl isocyanate. Compounds having an arylthiophenyl or aryloxyphenyl substituent may be prepared by the reaction of the corresponding halophenyl compound with the appropriate arylthiol or arylol in the presence of a base, e.g. K2C03. Compounds having a phenyl group substituted by dimethylamino may be prepared by the reaction of the corresponding fluorophenyl derivative with dimethylacetamide. Compounds having a thiocarbamoyl substituent may be prepared by the reaction of the corresponding cyano compound with hydrogen sulphide and ammonia. Compounds in which R is 4 methylthiazol 2 ylphenyl may be prepared as follows EMI19.1 Compounds having an isothiocyanato substituent may be prepared from the corresponding amino substituted compound by reaction with thiophosgene. Compounds in which R 2 is COCH2SCN may be prepared from the corresponding compound in which R is COCH2Cl or COCE2Er by reaction with sodium or potassium thiocyanate. Compounds in which R is hydroxymethyl may be prepared from the corresponding compound in which R is H by reaction with formalin. All the above methods are conventional and are illustrated in the specific Examples hereinafter. Salts of the compounds of the formula I can also be prepared by conventional procedures. Many of the starting materials for the above procedures are known compounds see e.g. British Patent SpecificationsNos. 1459571, 1468111 and 1516024 or may be prepared by procedures analogous to those of the prior art.
