# Amide and hydrazide derivatives of N trifluoracetyl N phosphonomethylglycine, herbicidal compositions and their use.

## Abstract
This disclosure relates to alkyl N trifluoroacetyl N phosphonomethylglycine amide and hydrazide deriva tives, to herbicidal compositions containing same and to the herbicidal use thereof. These amide and hydrazide deriva tives are useful as pre emergent and or post emergent her bicides. The novel N trifluoroacetyl N phosphonomethyl glycinate amide and hydrazide derivatives of this invention are those having the formula
