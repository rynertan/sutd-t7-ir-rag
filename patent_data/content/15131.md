## Description
Support structure for wind powered electric generatorsThe invention relates to improvements in wind powered electric generators and is particularly concerned with support structures for such generators.The study of solar energy and its practical application has been of academic interest for many years, but it was the world oil crisis in 1973 74 that provided the incentive to confront in a realistic way the many complicated and difficult problems associated with applied solar energy. Solar energy may be divided into four main fields of secondary energy forces a direct sunlight i.e. heat and light, b wind, c waves i.e. marine forces generated by wind, and d water i.e. hydro electric from rainfall and thermal marine i.e. differential temperatures between deep water and ocean surface. For the maximum development of solar energy, these four main energy elements must be developed in direct relation to each forces specific energy contribution, having regard to its nature in time and place.The well known advantages of wind energy are that it is free, unlimited, perpetually renewable and from the environmental aspect completely non polluting. All these positive factors, unfortunately, are usually over emphasised by enthusiastic alternative energy advocates, without consideration of its many and formidable disadvantages. These major problems are its complete lack of control in time, speed or force, temperature, direction, location and season. These normal functions of universal meterological conditions over surface of world do not lend themselves to any form of scientific control, in spite of many such attempts in the past.In most of the wind energy research completed to date over the last 20 30 years, lack of full appreciation of these disadvantages and constraints have inhibited the full development of wind energy and its massive potential contribution to energy starved world economics.In the course of a Research Study on the Theory and Practice of Wind Energy Electricity Generation, the present applicant carried out an in depth study of every known wind energy system in existence since approximately 1950, both inEurope and to a lesser extent in the U.S.A. Without exception every system was found to be a complete interdependent entity, i.e. an integral combined support tower and wind rotor. From earliest times, all traditional windmills as used for corn grinding and flood control consisted of a massive stone or timber central tower supporting an up wind four bladed timber and canvas rotor. From about 1900 onwards, with the advent of steel or cast iron lattice towers, most large scale electricity generating wind turbines were of the down wind variety in relation to the support tower, which general system persists to the present day.As a result of practical experience from some large size units, recently erected for test purposes in the U.S.A. Ohio, New Mexico and North Carolina it was found that the large two blade high speed rotor on a lattice tower is not a complete success.Essential to the study of modern wind power are many important technical publications such as The Generation of Electricity by Wind Power by E.W. Golding, first published in the U.K. 1955 and Power from the Wind by Palmer C. Putnam, published in the U.S. 1948 . Both publications are most comprehensive and may be considered the starting point of all wind energy research since 1948 to date.In E.W. Golding s book, are listed all the major wind power electric generator plans ranging from the giant Honnef 1945 design with tower height 785 feet to the large number of European, U.K. and Russian designs varying from 160 feet to 100 feet tower heights. Palmer C. Putnam s work deals specifically with the entire research and construction programme for the ill fated Smith Putnam WindGenerator built at Grandpas Knob,, near Rutland, Vermont, U.S.A. which came on line in 1941. On 25 March 1945 this brilliant experiment ended with the failure and breaking of one 8 ton blade, which could not be economically replaced at the time.From 1946 onwards to 1968 most wind energy research was carried out by the E.R.A. Electrical Research Association of Surrey in England. This institution s publications and translations from many foreign sources on wind energy research comprises one of the most important sources of confirmed and tested wind energy data.E.R.A. tests fully prove the feasibility and availability of the vast wind power h At 1fltj 0 s Qn the N .W coast 9f Europe. From 1960 to date, the greatest source of wind energy research is the U.S. Government sponsored Wind Energy Research Programme implemented by a large number of U.S. Universities apd private research establishments. Full details of this vast amount of practical and theorectical wind energy research are given in the various Proceedings of the major U.S. Wind Energy Workshops ERDA sponsored held in Washington 1973, 1975, 1977, and 1979 not yet published .International wind energy research to date is reported from every possible aspect in the Proceedings of the First 1976 and Second 1978 InternationalSymposium on Wind Energy Systems held respectively in London and Amsterdam, and sponsored by the BHRD Fluid Engineering Organisation of Carnfield, Bedfordshire,England. A most comprehensive analysis of wind energy technology was given at the Advanced Wind Energy Systems Conference at Stockholm, August 29 30th 1974 under the auspices of the National Swedish Board for Technical Development, theSwedish State Power Board, and N.A.S.A. In 1931 in Russ a, at Yalta on the Black Sea coast, a 100 KW D.C. wind driven generator was erected on a combined lattice tower and rotatable rere inclined lattice wind force resisting strut. The base of the strut was provided with an electric trolley movable on a circular track, thus controlling the rotor orientation in relation to wind direction. The wind rotor on the unit is of the upwind type only.Of similar type construction, for down wind rotor application only, is a rotating rigid leg tripod support designed by the Folland Aircraft Co. Ltd. in 1951, and described in British Patent Specification No. 7 3,577. This rotor support unit s stability depends entirely on three rigid strut ural legs, the removal of any one of which causes complete collapse. It may be deduced therefore that the failure of al the above wind energy systems to reach practical fruition was due entirely to lack of suitable structural materials, which could withstand the full rigours and fury of the worst possible wind and weather conditions. A study of more recent U.S. wind energy system patents failed to find any separate wind rotor supporting structures or multi array rotor supporting structures or multi array rotor supporting systems. U.S. patents 2,052,816 and 2,153,532 describe small complete wind energy systems with double two blade high speed rotors, and with single high speed rotor on upward tilting generator. U.S. patent 2,484,291 describes a high speed two bladed wind rotor cum variable air compressor on a fixed tower, with provision for a yaw mechanism to yaw the rotor in response to high wind loat ng.U.S. patent 4,088,352 describes a wind driven rotor designed to tilt as a gyroscope in response to excessive wind forces, and is supported by a heavy full wind load resistant structural system designed to swivel about its central vertical axis in response to wind orientation. One variation of the arrangement described in this patent is designed for permanent fixing between opposing conveyor walls.In the design of all Wind Energy Conversion Systems WECS the basic wind power formula usually applied is the Betz formula A. Betz, Gottengen 1927 KAV3 or many variations of the same as the theoretical maximum power available from the wind through a given swept area. In practice, however, the wind power available is usually no greater than .35 KAV3 to .4 KAV3 due to mechanical and aerodynamic imperfections of any practical WECS.Since the 1973 renewed surge of interest in alternative energy sources, all major test WECS erected have been of the single generator type, driven usually by a high speed two blade wind turbine or motor. All have invariably failed.Failure in all cases was due to blade failure due to limited strength of available blade materials extremely complicated blade feathering and yawing mechanism, and wind shadow vibration forces from large support tower structures in relation to blade width. All such units have in general been limited in size to less than 300 ft diam. This small rotor diameter is not calculated to deliver electric power of any enormous significance 2 MW 2.5 MW being the absolute maximum output under ideal conditions. This maximum capacity is achieved only in winds up to a limited speed, thereafter the WECS is designed to feather the turbine rotor blade, which is of variable pitch, to shed wind speed.Further increase by wind speed above the WECS feathering capacity involves its yawing or furling out of the direct wind force by turning the entire wind turbine and generator unit which is situated on top of a supporting tower, at right angles to wind direction. Still further increases of wind speed involves complete close down of the WECS unit by braking the rotor and generator to avoid complete destruction of the unit.Such constrained approach to WECS design, ar its application to harnessing of the tremendous energy freely available from e wind must, of its nature, achieve only limited success so limited in fact that it can never possibly make a worthwhile contribution to world energy problems. From wind power tables based on the Betz formula and modified Betz formula, it can be observed that realistic and economic wind power is only available from swept areas much greater than 200 ft. Practical power diameters are shown to be from 300 ft to 600 ft diam., or greater if and when technically feasible.In the context of the modern industrial economy, however, even single WECS units of 300 ft 600 ft. diam., would be considered of little or no significance, and it can be shown that large multi WECS units can possibly form the nucleus of a viable, economic and technically feasible WECS power system compatible with the standard National Electric Power Grid System universally used for power distribution.It is an object of the invention to overcome the disadvantage of known wind energy conversion systems and to provide a support structure for a wind powered electric generator which will enable the generator to operate efficiently in varying wind conditions without a major risk of breakdown, and which will support rotors of up to 600 ft in diameter.According to the invention, a support structure for a wind powered electric generator comprises a substantially horizontal load carrying beam located above the surface of the earth and adapted to carry a rotor and generator, wherein the beam is anchored by means of a stabilising stay system connecting the beam to anchor means located at the surface of the earth and wherein the beam and or the anchor means are movable in an arc relative to each other whereby the support structure may be maintained downwind of the anchor means and the rotor may face into the wind irrespective of the direction of the wind. Preferably, the anchor means is fixed and the beam is movable in a circle about the anchor means.In a preferred embodiment the horizontal beam is mounted on top of a vertical tower to form a crane like structure of the cantilever type. The whole crane like structure is mobile and is rotatable about fixed anchors to which it is attached by means of the stabilising stay system. Preferably the stay system comprises at least one tensioned stay connecting the beam to the anchor means and at least a second stay connecting the tower adjacent the foot thereof to the anchor means.In one embodiment the vertical tower and beam are mounted on a horizontal platform to which they are secured by a suitable system of stays. The platForm is movable over the ground on suitable ground contacting members such as wheels or tracks, the Fath of movement of the platform being constrained by tensioned stays connecting the platform and horizontal beam to fixed anchor means. In another embodiment the ground contacting members are wheels which are adapted to run on tracks which are disposed in a circle of which the anchor means defines the centre.In yet another embodiment both the anchor means and support structure are movable on concentric tracks. The support structure and anchor means may each suitably be mounted on rolling stock, such as wagons or the like, movable on circular railway tracks.In a preferred embodiment the platform carrying the vertical tower is located in a body of water, suitably the sea. The platform may float on top of the water surface but preferably is semi submersible or fully submersible. Means are provided for moving the platform in a substantially circular path around a fixed anchor which is connected to the horizontal beam by a stabilising stay system. Preferably, means are provided for temporarily securing the platform to the sea bed when it is stationary. The anchor means may be fixedly attached to the sea bed or to a rock, small island or other land mass.In order to obtain power output on a viable economic scale it is preferred to use a plurality of support structures, as described in any of the above embodiments, which are connected together to form a multi module array which is movable as a whole about anchoi means. The anchor means may comprise a single anchor, either fixed or movable, to which each of the modular structures is attached by a stabilising stay system. The invention also includes a rotor mechanism comprising a rotary ring supporting the rotor blades and having fixedly attached thereto a plurality of main gear wheels, a support means for the ring comprising a plurality of rotatable tyred wheels arranged in a circle about the main beam and in fixed relation thereto, the wheels being in frictional contact with tracks on the inner surface of the rotary ring such that rotation of the ring causes the wheels to rotate, and secondary gear wheels for transmitting drive from the main gear wheels to a drive shaft connected to the generators. The invention also includes braking means for the system comprising conventional drum or disc brakes which act on the wheels and thereby retard or stop rotation of the rotary ring. A second braking system is also preferably provided comprising a magnetic brake acting on the inner surface of the ring.

The tower t is pos. tioned on a flat horizontal platform 3 which, as shown in the drawings, 55 polygonal in plan, but which can be circular or of other suitable shape.The platform 3 is mounted on a plurality of trolleys 4 which comprise massi e balancing loads carried on wheels 5. Thus, by means of the wheeled trolleys 4 the platform can be moved over the ground. The wheels 5 may be pneumatic wheels mov able on a prepared surface or of the steel flanged type movable on railway tracks.It will be appreciated that alternative means may be provided for moving the platform 3 such as, for example, caterpillar tracks, skids or hoover pads.The tower 2 is held in position on the platform 3 by means of tensioned stays 6, 7 which are connected to the perimeter of the platform 3. The beam 1 is held in horizontal position by means of stays 8 which also are connected to the perimeter of platform 3. Neutral structural stability for the structure is obtained by the massive balancing loads of the trolleys 4. The beam 1 supports a rotor 9, rotor support mechanism 10 and a generator room 11 which are described in more detail below. The beam 1 also acts as a crane unit which may be used to lift wind turbines, generators, gears, drive shafts, switchgear and the like into position.Live structural stability and anchoring of the structure is obtained by means of stays 12, 13 which are attached at one end to the beam 1 and platform 3 respectively, and at the other end are rotatably connected to a fixed anchor unit 04. The anchor 14 is firmly fixed to the ground by, for example, deep foundation piles. Because of the rotational fixing of the stays 12, 13 to anchor 14 the whole support structure can travel on wheels 5 on a circular path of which the anchor 14 is the centre and which has a radius substantially equal in length to the length of stay 13. In this way the structure can always be positioned downwind of the anchor 14 as shown, for example, in Figure 7 in which the direction of the wind is indicated by W. Preferably, the stays 12, 13 are connected to the front of the structure so that the rotor 9 is positioned to windward of the tower 2 thus avoiding wind shadow vibration. Alternatively, the rotor can be positioned to the leeward side of the tower 2, as shown in Figure 7a, in which case there may be some wind shadow vibration but this is kept to a minimum because of the narrow width of tower 2 relative to the rize of the rotor blades.Compete structural resistance to all wind forces may be achieved by means of the tensioned stays , 13 and this coupled with the structural stability of the crane like support structure means that rotor blades of up to 600 ft in diameter lay be utilised and can be operated in high wind speeds where conventional hi S would have to be closed down. The generator room 11 and rotor support means 10 are shown in more detiliti Figures 5 to 6b. The generator room 11 contains any number of AC and or DC or other electric generators 16 of sufficient capacity and number equal to the calculated power output of the wind turbine. The rotor blades 9 are fixed to a rotary ring 50, to the interior of which are fixedly attached a plurality of main internal gear wheels 17. The inner surface of the rotary ring 50 is formed with a plurality of annular channel shaped tracks 51 which receive the tread and side wall portions of rotating twin pneumatic tyred wheels 19 which may, for example, be in the form of conventional truck wheels. The wheels 19 extend around the inner perimeter of the ring 50 and are held in fixed relation to the lattice structure of the beam 1 by means of spokes 52.Thus, the ring 50 and tracks 51 rotate around the assembly of wheels 19 which in turn are caused to rotate about axles 53. The axles 53 are in fixed relation to the beam 1. The frictional connection between the tyres of wheels 19 and tracks 51 can be adjusted by varying the air pressure in the tyres. The wheels 19 act to stabilise and support the rotor mechanism and preferably the air pressure of the tyres in the uppermost segment of the wheel array, as shown, for example, in Figure 6, is maintained at a higher level than those in the lowermost segment.Torque from the rotor blades 9 is transmitted by the gear wheels 17 through secondary gear wheels 18 to a drive shaft driving the generators in well known manner. The generators are preferably used to control rotation of the rotors.When wind speed is low it is preferred to use AC generators only which can feed directly into a national power grid. If wind speed increases above about 20 mph the DC generators or AC generators with converters can be brought into operation. These impose an enormous frictional load on the rotor and so act as a brake on the system.Power output from the DC generators can be used, for example for hydrogen generating systems, for steel smelting, or for powering a pump storage scheme, and is particularly suitable to provide a source of hydrogen and oxygen for recovery of oil from Tar Sands and heavy ol deposits, and for secondary oil recovery from existing oil wells which have been abandoned due to congealing by wax and heavy oil residues.In order to close down the turbine, for example for maintenance or in an emergency, there is provided a braking system for the wheels 19 in the form of conventional drum or disc brakes 20 which may be hydraulically operated. Braking may also be carried out by means of magnetic brakes 54 which act on the inner surface of ring 50. Alternatively, in place of drum brakes 20 there may b used induction type electric generators in part or all of the rotor supporting planetary wheel system. Sufficient generators may be installed to deliver full power output for wind speeds of up to 70 mph, while simultaneously maintaining rotor speed control by induction electric braking, i.e. D.C. injection, to some of the generators. Generator location is shown 20a in Figure 5.As a further alternative, or in addition to, the drum brakes 20, there may be installed rotary hydraulic pumps in part or all of the rotor supporting planetary wheel system. These hydraulic pumps may be connected together or may supply by suitable hydraulic pipe lines , hydraulic motors cum electric generators situated in the generator room, or elsewhere on the structure.As shown in Figures 4 and 6 the horizontal beam 1 is preferably provided with cranes 21 which move on crane tracks 22 and which may be utilised to move generator and rotor mechanism. As shown more clearly in Figures 1 and 4 the beam 1 is provided with a plurality of fixed circular support members 23 which support a cone shaped membrane 24 which covers the beam, generator room and rotor mechanism. The conical configuration of the cover membrane 24 increases the wind speed through the wind turbine swept area.The stays 12, 13, 6 and 8 may be made from high tensile strength steel wire but preferably are of sheathed polyamide filaments for example of the kind sold under the trade name KEVLAR or PARAFIL . This cable is of greater tensile strength than its equivalent steel wire rope, and over three times stronger than all earlier types of synthetic cable. A most important technical aspect of this new cable, which makes it an ideal material for use in the construction of large scale wind energy systems according to the invention, is its density or weight factor in relation to traditional steel cabled of equivalent breaking strain. It varies from one fifth to one seventh the weight of equivalent steel cable.By use of this immensely strong synthetic cable, extremely long tensile structural members may be formed with minimum catenary curves than would be possible with equivalent strength steel cable.In addition to having great tensile strength coupled with minimum weight, synthetic sheathed PARAFIL or KEVLAR cables ere fully resistant to sea water and all marine organisms to sunlight and UV degV ation and also to ordin wy fatigue, abrasion and frictional shear. Being also letely mist and corrosio proof, grease or other protective coating is comp r unnecessary.Critical factor in the use of sheathed PARAFIL and KEVLAR cables in the construction of extremely large scale wind energy systems are their resistance to icing, or build up of heavy ice. Tests on PARAFIL and KEVLAR rigging on ships under Arctic conditions have shown that ice build up is impossible any ice adhering to cables being shed by natural vibration of the taut cables A further less obvious advantage is reduced interference to television and radar signals.In order to obtain power output on a viable economic scale it is preferable to use a plurality of WECS units and one embodiment of such a multi module system is illustrated in Figures 8 and 9. In this arrangement the support structure for each modular unit is substantially as described with reference to Figures 1 to 3 and like reference numerals are used to denote like parts. In this embodiment the perimeter of each horizontal support platform 3 is formed of rigid compression members 30 which are connected to the foot of the vertical tower 2 by tensioned radial members 31 to form an extremely rigid but light platform. As with the construction of Figure 1 the platform 3 is carried on trolleys 4 which include massive balancing loads which give neutral structural stability to the platform.Each platform 3 is connected to each adjacent platform by utilising trolley members 34 common to adjacent platforms and also by means of tensioned longitudinal members 35 which are fixed through all platforms to form an interconnected modular structure. A substantially horizontal tensioned system of stays 35a is utilised to interconnect the beams 1 of each of the units at high level to form in effect a longitudinal beam imparting further rigidity to the multi module system.In areas of extreme high wind velocities and violent fluctuations, or during intermittent severe storms, multi modular structural resistance to dangerous vibrations and oscillations is achieved by increased rigidity of the high level centre tensile stays 35a of Figure 9. Figure 9a shows rigid latticed braced tensile beams 35b in position between highest sections of the supporting towers 2. Tensile stays 35d are used to support the beams 35b Any number of horizontal rigid tensile stabilising beams 35b to achieve maximum required stability may be installed between the vertical towers 2 2 A tensile beam 35c is shown in Figure 9a located intermediate the height of the tower 2, e.g. midway up the tower. As shown more clearly in Figure 8 each modular unit is connected by tensioned stays 12, 13 to a common fixed anchor 14 about which the multi module system can rotate as a whole. Another embodiment of a multi modular system is shown in Figure 10. In this arrangement the perimeter of each platform 3 is formed of tensile members 30a which are connected to tower 2 by rigid compressive members 31a. Secondary tensile members 36 are disposed parallel to members 30a and interconnect the compressive members 31a to provide increased structural stability. Each platform 3 is interconnected with adjacent platforms 3 by a common longitudinal compressive member 31b and also by longitudinal tensioned members 30.Figure 10a is a plan view of a rigid tensile beam system located at the level of rotor support beam 1, and shows the horizontal stabilisation of structure by tensile units, 33a, 35b, 35e and 35f. In the basic structural system as shown in Figure 1, the main wind forces acting on the structure are resisted by stay 12 which acts as the major tensile element. Wind energy research has shown, however, that a 500 ft. diameter multiblade rotor subjected to wind forces of up to 120 mph requires a stabilising tensile resistance of over 9,000 tons. This great tensile force may be carried by stay cable 12 as shown in Figure 1, or alternatively by a number secondary tensile cables, 12a as shown in Figure lOa.Secondary main cables 12a connect to centre point of rigid tensile members 35a and 35b, and ultimately to the rear of main rotor support beam 1 via cable 35e.Further secondary main tensile anchorage cables 12b and 12c etc., may be attached, respectively, in a similar manner to the tower 2, and the centre point of lower transverse rigid tensile members 35c, as shown in Figure 9a and Figure 16a.A five unit modular system is illustrated in Figure 11 and 12. Figure 11 is essentially a layout plan showing the lines of the circular paths followed by the wheeled trolleys 4 and these paths are designated by the letters tl to tll Each path may comprise a track or road having a prepared surface in which case the ground conta ting members of trolleys 4 may be in the form of pneumatic tyred wheels or hooverpads or alternatively the paths may be in the form of railway or other flanged tracis.As shown more clearly in Figure 12 there is provided on a special heavy duty track or road t1 at the two extremities of the system an independent extra heavy weight mobile anchor unit 4a which preferably is used with all embodiments of multi unit systems because it ensures structural stability of the entire vertical structure. The entire multi unit system is moved along paths or tracks tl to by means of a system of electric motors and variable gearing carried by each trolley 4. In yet a further embodiment illustrated in Figures 13 to 18 there is provided a mobile anchor system such that both the anchor means and the array of modular units are movable on concentric paths. Preferably, in this embodiment the paths are in the form of railway or like tracks tl, t2, t3, t4 and t5. As shown most clearly in Figure 16 the platform 3 is dispensed with, and each aswer 2 is mounted directly on a wheeled railway flat or truck 40 which is firmly coupled on railway tracks to cars 41. The cars 41 can be loaded with balancing weights and there is preferably a sufficient length of combined rolling stock or cars to establish structural stability to the tower. Longitudinal stability to the tower is provided by tension stays 6, 7 and 8 which connect the tower and beam, respectively, to trucks 42 which carry massive anchor weights.Lateral stability for the towers may be provided also by tension stays 6a, 7a and 8a which connect the tower and beam, respectively, to loaded anchor trucks 42a which run on tracks parallel to and concentric with the tracks on which the tower 1 moves. The trucks 42a are interconnected by means of cars or other rolling stock 41a which may also be loaded if necessary. Each modular unit of the multi unit system is interconnected by means of longitudinal tensioned members 30 to form a single structural array which, as shown in Figure 13, is movable as a whole about tracks t to t5. Each of the structural units is connected by means of tensioned stays 12 and 13 to a single anchor 14 which also is in the form of rolling stock carrying a massive load. As shown in Figures 13a and 13b there may be two, three or more mobile anchor units 14.Indeed, there is no limit to the number of rolling stock or primary mobile anchor units which may be used in the system to the maximum capacity of the circular tracks. Figure 14a is a plan of a rigid tensile beam system to interconnect the towers 2 at the level of beam 1 similar to that described in relation to Figure lOa. Figure 15c shows rigid latticed braced tensile beams 35b positioned between the towers similar to the arrangement described in relation to Figure 9a above.Details of alternative methods for mounting the tower 1 on rolling stock is illustrated in Figures 16 and 17. As shown in Figure 16, the tower 2 may be built on a truck movable on a single track. Alternatively, in the arrangements shown in Figure 17, the tower 1 is constructed on two, or three, flat trucks running on two or three concentric circular railway tracks. Figur 16a shows the use of rigid horizontal beams to reinforce the tower 1 and shows the location of the main stays 12, 12a and secondary stays l2b and 12c. Figure 18 illus trates the use of double, treble, quadruple tracks systems for supporting the balancing loads 42a. The loads may comprise, for example, large metal blocks or interlocking blocks made from aggregate concrete.As an alternative to the use of heavy loads the tracks can be securely fixed to the ground by means of piles or the like and the trucks are secured to the tracks by suitable flanges on the truck wheels which are retained by complementary flanges on the tracks as shown in more detail in Figures 16b and 16c. Figure 16c also indicates an alternative ground anchorage system, using expanded tensile piles set in the ground at such depth and angle from the vertical as to resist multi module full side tensile structural loading.Removal of snow and or ice from any of the stay cables of the support structures may be achieved by attachment of electric vibrators to the cables at points of maximum oscillation. Heavy snow or ice removal from the rigid lattice members may be achieved by enveloping the members in a reinforced plastics sheet covering within which warm air is circulated.The greatest wind forces on the earth are to be found over the oceans and over coastal waters and the support structures of the invention are particularly suitable for use at sea or in any large area of water over which strong winds blow. One such embodiment for use in medium water depths of up to 500 to 600 ft is illustrated in Figure 19 of the drawings, in which the horizontal beam and tower construction is substantially as described with reference to Figure 1 and like reference numerals denote like parts. However, in this embodiment the tower is supported by semi submersible flotation units 60 and 61. Suitably, the flotation unit 61 on which the tower stands forms the centre of a circle of which the flotation units 60 form the circumference. The flotation units 61 are joined together by longitudinal tensioned members 62 see Figure 20 , and are joined to the central flotation unit 61 by radial compressive members 63.At sea the structure must not only withstand wind forces but also wave forces. InFigure 19 the sea level is indicated by the line marked S.L. while the broken lineW indicates the approximate maximum wave height which may be, for example, 100 feet.Live structural stability and maximum wind wave resistance is achieved by means of tension cables 12 and 13 which connect the structure to a primary sea anchor system 114. The anchor comprises a steel lattice tower 115 which is rendered stable by means of diagonal tensile stays which connect the tower to piles 117 driven into the sea bed or, alternatively, to massive concrete anchor blocks resting on the sea bed. The tension stays 12 and 13 are attached at one end to a rotating member 118 atop the anchor 11 . The other end of stay 12 is connected to the front of the beam 1 while one of the stays 13 is connected to the flotation units 60 and the other to an adjustable anchor for the flotation units as described hereinafter.As with the land based embodiment, the support structure is able to move in a circular path about the anchor 114 so that the rotor can be maintained downwind of the anchor. The support structure may be moved by means of electrically or hydraulically powered rudder propeller thrustors 119 which are affixed to the flotation units 60. There are a sufficient number of such thrustors to provide location movement and control of the structures under all sea and wind conditions.In order to stablise the structure in any particular location on the circular path, there are provided anchors 120 which are adapted to rest on the sea bed and which are connected to the flotation units 60 and 61 by means of cables 121.When it is desired to move the structure the anchors 120 may be raised from the sea bed by applying a vertical lift to the flotation units 60 and 61 by means of vertical thrustors 122. This vertical lift may be supplemented by increasing the buoyancy of the flotation units with compressed air. Alternatively, winches may be provided for lifting the cables 121Suitably, a control room 123 is provided on the tower 2 for use in controlling the thrustors and anchors 120.Figure 20 is a plan view showing a plurality of support structures of the kind shown in Figure 19 connected together to form a multi modular array which is movable as a whole about the fixed anchor 114. Each support structure unit is interconnected with adjacent units in a manner similar to that described with reference to Figure 8 above.Figure 22 illustrates a support structure for use in extremely shallow water.In this embodiment the flotation units 60 and 61 are fully buoyant and float on the surface. The primary anchor member 114 consists of a simple platform firmly fixed to sea, lake or river bed by means of concrete piies 117.Figure 23 illustrates an embodiment cf a structural support unit Tor use in relatively deep sea waters. In this embodiment, the semi submersible flotation units 60 and 61 are built on a very large scale to resist larger wave and storm forces expected in deep waters. In this embodiment the anchor means 114 is also of extremely heavy design and is of the fully submerged type being fixed to the seabed by piles or other suitable methods.Figure 24 shows in diagrammatic plan a multi modular system of support structures connected together as described in relation to Figure 20. However, in this embodiment the fixed anchor 114 is connected to the modular array by means of a rigid longitudinal floating member 130 which extends also to the leeward side of the array to provide increased horizontal structural rigidity by the use of diagonal tensile members 131 which connect the structure 130 to the individual support structures.As is well known to students of physical geography coastlines subjected to ages of assault by wind and wave action, are invariably well indented and have many islands of all shapes and sizes, e.g. West coasts of Ireland and Scotland, European coasts of Norway, Denmark, N. Germany, Holland and N. France, N.E. coast ofU.S.A. and Canada and the N.W. coast of U.S.A. and Canada. Many of these islands are small uninhabited windswept useless wastelands of rock and sand and no economic value to adjoining mainland. One of the objects of this invention is the conversion of these types of uninhabited windswept islands to major sources of Wind Generated Electric Power.Thus, as illustrated in Figgure 25 of the drawings, an island B is used as the primary anchor means and control centre for a plurality of support structures of the invention arranged in a multi modular array A . The array A is connected to the anchor means B by means of tension cables 12, 13 such that the array may travel as a whole in a circular path about the island B . The path of travel of the structures is indicated by the broken lines D1 and D2. In order to prevent the tension stays 12, 13 from damage or interference by rocks or the like, the stays are supported above ground level by means of a stressed cable 132 which is supported by a plurality of poles arranged in a circle around the anchor means.Electric power generated by the rotors may be conveyed to the mainland by undersea high voltage transmissions cables E to a mainland distribution centre F .An embodiment for use with an island of larger size is illustrated in Figure 25b in which the anchor means 14 comprises a plurality of loaded trucks of the kind described for example in Figure 18, which are movable on a circular or curved track system firmly fixed to the island s surface. Preferably, the track, t, is located at the perimeter of the island so that the tension stays 12, 13 may be kept to a reasonable length and are kept clear of rocks and the like. in the case of very large islands, the track need not be circular but can conform to the shape of the perimeter of the island.Yet further embodiments of the invention for use with extremely large wind turbines are illustrated in Figures 26 to 28. In these embodiments the support tower 2 is dispensed with and the beam 1 forms part of a lighter than air vehicle which preferably is of the air ship type helium filled unit which is designed to carry the total load of the sytem. Preferably, an array of such airborne ships is used and these are moored to a rotary mobile anchorage system as described above in relation to Figures 13 and 14. The airborne structure is attached to the anchor means by means of tension stays 12, 13 and to movable trolleys 41 by tension stays 8. As illustrated in Figure 28, the mooring system of stays is 0 based on 60 triangulation for maximum stability. If desired, a secondary sup port for the airborne structure is provided by means of ancillary air ships which are connected to the main airborne structure by means of cables 140.
