# Belt conveyor apparatus.

## Abstract
The belt conveyor apparatus 11 comprises means which define a conveyance path 13 including a first pulley 23 and at least a second pulley 25 . The endless belt member 27 is adapted for continuous travel about the pulleys 23, 25, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43 and comprises a lower portion 53 which engages the pulleys and an integral upper portion 55 adapted to receive objects 83 therein at a first location 15 on said conveyance path and transport the objects to a second location 17 for discharge. The upper belt portion includes an opposed pair of longitudinally disposed crest like members 61, 63 , biased towards each other in a substantially abutting relation ship. The crest like members define therebetween a continu ous, normally biased closed, channel 65 along the upper belt portion. Means 49, 51 are disposed at the first and second locations and operatively associated with the belt member for urging the normally biased together crest like members apart in order to provide access to the continuous channel whereby ob jects can be received into, or discharged from the channel. Mo tive means 48 are in communication with the means defining the conveyance path for effecting the travel of the endless belt member about the conveyance path. The conveyance path can be configured to include travel through two or more elevations and one or more directional changes in order to convey objects above, below and or around existing structures.
