The compounds of this invention are water insoluble and are therefore capable of removing themselves from soil and water by means of decomposition due to soil bacteria and have been found to be no toxic to aquatic life and small animals, yet the compounds can be made r ter miscible, if so desired. A method for preparing the compounds of the present invention comprises the reaction of a 2 moles of at least one compound of the formula EMI4.1 wherein M is ammonium or an alkali metal and R is an alkyl containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and b 1 mole of a compound of the formula NS208. wherein M is ammonium or an alkali metal. The novel compounds can be prepared by using compound a as a reactant or by initially forming said compound a by the reaction of two moles of a halogenated, preferably chlorinated, phenoxyalkanoic acid with an equimolar amount of an aqueous solution of an alkali metal or ammonium hydroxide which is heated to a temperature sufficient to cause said halogenated phenoxyalkanoic acid to become solubilized therein just prior to the addition of said acid. The resulting reaction product which is present in solution contains a compound corresponding to compound a , above, two moles of said compound then being reacted with an aqueous solution of 1 mole of a compound b wherein M is ammonium or an alkali metal, said alkali metal generally being sodfum or potassium.Compound b is preferably ammonium persulfate and is preferably present in 1,000 ml. of water when combined with compound a to form the novel compounds of this invention. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of this invention, 2 moles of 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid is initially added to a heated aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide wherein 2 moles of potassium hydroxide is present in 1,000 ml. of water . The aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide is then heated to a temperature sufficient to cause said 2,4 dicloro phenoxyacetic acid to become soluble in said water which is generally achieved at temperatures up to about 950 C. A clear light brown solution results and 1 mole of ammonizz persulfate in 1,000 ml. of water is then preferably added to the light brown solution resulting in the formation of a light tan precipitate that is recovered by filtration and suction. The tan precipitate, bis 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetate, is preferably dried, under vacuum at a pressure of about 5 mm. pressure and at a temperature of between about 70 and 90 C and preferably between 80 and 90 C with best results at 800C.The filtrate contains 1 mole of ammonium sulfate and I mole of potassium sulfate that can be recovered by drying and can be subsequently used as an agricultural fertilizer. In preparing the compounds of this invention, other halogenated phenoxyalkanoic acids can be substituted for the 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, including, for example, pchlorophenoxyacetic acid, 2,4,5 trichlorophenoxypropionic acid, 2,3,4,5,6 pentachlorophenoxypropionic acid, 2,3,5,6 tetrachlorophenoxyacetic acid, forming respectively, bis p chlorophenoxyacetate, bis 2,4,5 trichlorophenoxypropionate, bis 2,3,4,5,6pentachlorophenoxypropionate and bis 2,3,5 ,6 tetrachlorophenoxy acetate. The compounds of the present invention can be employed in combination with an inert carrier. To make such a combination, the compounds of the present invention can be uniformly admixed with any of the well known free flowing particulate dry inert solid carriers which msy be organic or inorganic. These inert carriers include, for example, sawdust, the flour derived from soybeans, tobacco, walnut shell, wheat, wood by products, lignin and lignocellulose, ligninsulfonic acid, cork, urea form aldehyde, resins, silicas, carbonates, calcite, dolomite, silicates, tricalcium phosphate, boric acid, etc. The amount of the active compound of the invention which should be combined with a carrier as above described is determined by the intended use of the composition. In general, it is preferable to employ an herbicidal amount of the compound of the invention. Zn addition, the compositions may optionally contain from about .5 to about 1.0 weight percent of a surfactant or wetting agent, which renders the products wettable and dispersable, thereby facilitating the application thereof in the field. The ingredients may be simply mixed together thoroughly with said inert carrier or blended and then passed through a highspeed grinder, after which the mixture is a free flowing product. The surfactants disclosed in Bulletin E 607 of theBureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine of the United StatesDepartment of Agriculture, or surface active agents disclosed inU.S. Patents, Nos. 2,426,417 2,655,447 2,412,510 and 2,139,276, are suitable for use in the practice of this invention. Examples of suitable formulations include the following EXAMPLE O Three pounds 1.36 kg. of a composition in the form of a 325 mesh powder and containing the following ingredients By weight Bis 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetate 40 Surfactant Dupanol C 1 Diatomaceous earth Attaclay 59 was added to 100 gallons 378.53 1. of water. This aqueous compcr sition will control the following weeds present with sugarcane spiny amaranth, carpetweed, geranium, cress leafed groundsel, common lambsquarter, mexicantea, pellitoryweed, common purslane, ragweed, sowthistel and toadf lax. EXAMPLE TWO Field corn was planted in 3 foot 0.91 m. square flats wherein the seeds were equally spaced at 4 inch 10.16 cm. intervals. After planting, the surface of each flat was dusted with 9.4 gms. of a powder composition containing the following By weight Bis 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetate 10 Surfactallt Dupanol C 17. Diatomaceous earth Attaclay 897. The ingredients were initially mixed in a ribbon type blender and are thereafter passed through a high speed grinder to form a smooth, 325 mesh powder. The corn germination was ninety two percent on three replicated flats while there were no broad leaf weeds observed in the flats. EXAMP ThREE Thirty pounds 13.61 kg. of tis 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetate was dusted on one acre 0.40 ha. of a canal heavily infested with underwater growth. Hydrilla, coontail, watermillfoil, waterlilly, pondweed and naiad were each observed as being success fully controlled at the end of a three week period. No ill effect upon aquatic life was observed. EXAPIE FOUR A liquid composition was prepared by d issolving 2,722 gms., of bis 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetate in 1,000 gms. of a 50 percent solution of ethylenediamine in water. Forty grams of surfactant, amine salt of a higher secondary alkyl sulfate, was added thereto, with agitation. Water was added to make one gallon 3.78 1. . One quart 0.95 1. of this composition, when added to 100 gallons 378.53 1. of water and sprayed upon an acre 0.40 ha. of uncultivated raw land, controls the following weeds bindweed, bullthistle, chickweed, cockleburr, dogfennel, duckweed, elderberry, morning glory, mustard, pigweed, purslane, sowthistle, spiny amaranth, stinkweed, thistles, virginia creeper and wild garlic. EXAMPLE FIVE Two moles of 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid were dissolved in 1,000 ml. of water containing 2 moles of potassium hydroxide. One mole of ammonium persulfate was then dissolved in another 1,000 ml. of water and then the 2 aqueous solutions were admixed with each other. Instead of filtering the precipitated bis 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetate, the total reaction product was vacuum dried within the temperature range of 70 to 900 C and at about 5 mm. Hg of pressure. The yield was 725 gms. which is 97Z of the theoretical yield. The anhydrous product produced consists of bis 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetate, ammonium sulfate and potassium sulfate, said homogenous mixture thereafter being passed through a high speed grinder to produce a free flowing powder. EXAMPLE SIX The homogenous mixture as prepared in Example Five is added to 6,525 gms. of talc and ground in a ball mill for eight hours resulting in the formation of a fine free flowing powder. This powder was used to cover the surface of the furrow when corn was being cultivated. The powder covered about an acre and a half 0.61 ha. . Unexpectedly, the weeds in this treated area were controlled and the small amount of fertilizer was beneficial to the corn.
