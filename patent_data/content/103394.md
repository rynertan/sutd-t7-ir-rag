# Methods of investigating ground faults particularly on induction furnaces.

## Abstract
Methods of investigation ground faults, particularly on core less induction furnaces, using a computerised monitor which includes a first potential transformer connected across the coil and second potential transformer connected between one end of the coil and an electric ground. The relative location of a ground fault along the length of the coil is determined by computing the ratio of the transformer outputs. The monitor further includes a first current transformer in the coil power line and a second current transformer with melt bath ground. Internal ground faults are detected by computing the phase difference between the coil and ground currents. A graphic representation of the furnace is also generated to illustrate the location of the ground fault with respect to turns and yokes of the coil. The monitor also calculates liner wear by determining melt bath volume, which is inversely proportional to melt bath resistance, which in turn is proportional to coil resistance. If the furnace being monitored is provided with more than one coil, a differential current transformer is connected across each coil to detect the fault grounded coil when the transformer associated with the faulted coil exhibits a substantial ly non zero output.
