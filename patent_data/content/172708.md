# A telescopic strut.

## Abstract
A telescopic strut comprises a sealed cylinder 10 containing a fluid, a piston 12 fitted in the cylinder and sealed to the cylinder wall, and a hollow piston rod 20 extending from one side of the piston 12 and having a closed end 22 which extends out of one end of the cylinder. A hollow actuating rod 26 extends axially of the strut through the piston 12 to communicate with the hollow piston rod 20 and extends at its closed end through the other end of the cylinder. A valve 34 is operable by axial displacement of the actuating rod 26 to open and close fluid communication from one side of the piston 12 to the other, to vary the effective length of the strut.
