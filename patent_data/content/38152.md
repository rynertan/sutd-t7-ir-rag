# Improvements in scroll type fluid displacement apparatus.

## Abstract
A scroll type of fluid displacement apparatus is disclosed. The apparatus includes a housing having a fluid inlet and a fluid outlet port. A fixed scroll member is fixedly disposed with re spect to the housing and has an end surface from which a first wrap extends. An orbiting scroll member 30 is movably dis posed within the housing and has an end plate 301 from which a second wrap 302 extends. The first and second wraps interfit at an angular offset to make a plurality of line con tacts which define at least one pair of sealed off fluid pockets. A drive mechanism is connected to the orbiting scroll member to transmit orbital motion thereto. A rotation preventing means 37 prevents rotation of orbiting scroll member during orbital motion of the orbiting scroll member and is comprised of fixed ring 371 and a sliding ring 372 . The sliding ring is slidably connected to the fixed ring and also to the second end plate by keys 372a, b, c, d and keyways 301a, b, 371a, b . A plurality of pockets 39 is formed through the sliding ring and bearing elements 40 are retained within the pockets for transmitting axial thrust load from the orbiting scroll member to the fixed ring.
