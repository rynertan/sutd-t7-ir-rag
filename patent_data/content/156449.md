# PROCESSES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ALKYLENE GLYCOL IN THE PRESENCE OF ORGANOMETALATE

## Abstract
In processes for making alkylene glycols by the hydroly sis of alkylene oxides in the presence of selectivity enhancing metalate anion containing material, metalate an ion can be recovered from the alkylene glycol containing hydrolysis product by contact with a solid having electro positive complexing sites thereon such as anion exchange resins.
