# Pump isolation valve.

## Abstract
A pump isolation valve for selectively isolating the pump from the remainder of a coolant system which is compatible with the internal hydraulic arrangement of the pump during normal operation of the pump. The valve comprises a valve cyl inder 34 disposed around the pump and adjacent to the dis charge diffuser 28 with a turning vane 32 attached to the lower end of the valve cylinder 34 in a manner so as to hydrau lically match with the discharge diffuser 28 . The valve cylinder 34 is connected to a drive means for sliding the valve cylindor 34 relative to a diffuser support cylinder 40 so as to block a flow in either direction through the discharge diffuser when the valve is in the closed position and to aid in the flow of the cool ant from the discharge diffuser by means of the turning vane when the valve is in the open position.
