# Data transmission system.

## Abstract
A data transmission system comprising a transversal smearing filter 9 at the transmitting end and a transversal desmearing 9 filter at the receiving end. To simplify the filters, at least the sequence of coefficients of the desmearing filter b n is formed by elements of the set 1, 0, 1 , which results in an optimum smearing of noise pulses in the system compared with a system without such a filter.
