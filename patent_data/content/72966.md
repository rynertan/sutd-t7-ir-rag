# Integrated circuit structure and method for forming a recessed isolation structure for integrated circuits.

## Abstract
An integrated circuit structure having substrate contacts formed as a part of the isolation structure and the method to form such structure is described. The integrated circuit structure is composed of a monocrystaliine silicon body 2, 4 having a pattern of dielectric isolation surrounding regions of the monocrystalline silicon in the body. The dielectric isolation pattern includes a recessed dielectric portion 14 at and just below the surface of the integrated circuit and a deep portion 30 which extends through the recessed dielectric portion 14 and extends further into the monocrys talline silicon body 2, 4 than the recessed portion. A highly doped polycrystalline silicon substrate contact 30 is located within the deep portion of the pattern of isolation. The substrate contact extends from the surface of the pattern of isolation down to the bottom of the deep portion of the isolation where the contact electrically connects to the silicon body. Any of a variety of integrated circuit device structures may be incorporated within the monocrystalline silicon regions. These devices include bipolar transistors, field effect transistors, capacitors, diodes, resistors and the like.
