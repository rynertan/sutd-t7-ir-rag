# Fluidised bed combustion units.

## Abstract
The specification describes arrangements in which the attemperation or control of the temperature of a fluidised bed 13 in a fluidised bed combustion unit 10 effected by means of the mixture of a variable porportion of inert gas with fluidising air fed to the bed 13 may be supplemented with steam. Supplementation with steam being effected to a relatively minor extent during normal operation of the unit but being effected to a major extent when the temperature of the bed passes outside the range at which attemperation may be effected by use of recycled flue gas. The combustion unit 10 is described in use within an arrangement including process plant 12 in the form of a rotary drum dryer.
