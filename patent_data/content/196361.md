# Digitizing tablet system.

## Abstract
A digitizing tablet is disclosed in which two multiplexors are connected to alternate conductive loop elements in each plane of elements. The two multiplexors are connected to a differential amplifier. The signals from the differential ampli fier are demodulated. The demodulated signal is provided to an integrator. A microprocessor controlled reset switch is connected across the integrator to reset the integrator after the completion of each measurement. Grounded copper strips are used in the space formed within and between the conductive loop elements of the digitizing tablet to shield the loop elements from capacitive interference.
