## Description
BROADBAND IMPENDANCE TRANSPORMER AND RESONATORBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTiON 1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to the yield ot radio frequency fl.F. generators, and particularly to a tuned circuit which can be used as an impedance matching transronner or resonator in conjunction with such generators. A number of industrial applications Or R.F, energy require an adjustable radio frequency source and the ability to couple varying frequencies to the load circuit efficiently. During the industrial process, the frequency often has to be varied tn a range of tram 1 to 10 or mare.Linear broadband power amplifiers are characterized by a low efficiency and cannot be used in high power industrial applications,Class C power amplifiers may be used but are complicated in construction and cumbersome in use, especially if the frequency has to be changed continuously. It is therefore necessary to develop a new kind of tuned circuit that can combine good efficiency and broadband capability and which permits R.F. generators to be efriciently coupled to load circuits over wide frequency ranges, e,q. from several mz to several hundred mHz.2. De se rEt ior. of P r i o r ArtUntil now two kinds of tuned circuits have been used LC circuits, consisting of a coil and a separate condenser Transmission line resonators, such as a quarter wavelength of coaxial cable or a resonant cavity.Transmission line resonators have a much better Q factor than tc circuits rcutts but their physical dimensions are proportional to their wavelength. Their application is therefore limited to the highest frequencies, say above 100 MHz. The need for a broadband tuned circuit has been recognized elsewhere and the following solutions have been proposed. a S.

D ETAI DESCRIPTION 1. CAnstrution With reference now to the drawings, the impedance transformer and resonator comprises a sandwich tuned circuit having two parallel conducting plates 10 and 20 between which is interposed a spiral 12 of conducting material. The cavity 14 between the plates is filled with high quality insulating material that also gives the necessary mechanical strength to the whole unit.The electrical characteristics of the tuned circuit depend on its geometrical form and dimensions. The spiral lay have the forx of a watch spring. That is, a conducting strip wound around an axis that is parallel to the flat side of the strip. It also can be a flat spiral so that the flat side of the conducting strip lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the spiral.The factors influencing the electrical properties or the tuned circuit are 1 The distance between the parallel plates. 2 The breadth, or thickness of the spiral conducting strip. 3 The thickness or breadth, of the spiral in the radial dimenson, The variation of the above dimensions as a function of the radius of the spiral. 5 The total length of the spiral. II. Oerat.lon The operating principles of the tuned circuit are moat easily understood if one considers the space between the two parallel plates as a cavity resonator, The eleotromagnetic field in this cavity can, due to the presence of the spiral, oscillate only in a number of well defined modi.Near the surface of the two parallel conducting plates, sudden electric potential variations are not possible.The electric field near the surface and parallel to the surface must be a sinusoidal function of distance in evèry direetion The same is true for the electric field near the surface of the spiral. The electric field tangential to the spiral can vary only sinusoidally as a function of the distance along the spiral. Because both fields, the one at the surface of the parallel plates and the one at the surface of the spiral, are in fact one and the same field, there exists a kind of interference between the possible nodi of oscillation. Moreover the conditions imposed at the extremities of the spiral, potentials or exterior impedances tonnected between or imposed at the extremities of the spiral, and the exterior parallel plates limit further the number of possible midi.III. harcteristics 1. As a Resonator If one of the extremities of the spiral, ether the central one or the exterior one, is short circuited to the exterior plates, the other extremity of the spiral will behave as an impedance that depends on the frequency that is supplied. The impedance value will show maxima and minima ror a range of frequenciea that resembles a harmonic series and is in fact an approximation of an harmonic series. Depending on the kind of construction the following series can be appr oximated A. A series of odd harmonics B. A series of even harmonics C. All harmonics, even plus odd D. A series with split maxima, in which every odd harmonic is split into two peaks, the odd harmonic itself being a minimum.The separation between the peaks depends on the conatruction of the spiral. In fact, by gradual modifications of the kind of construction, it is possible to change A gradually into D,D into C,C into B and conversely.The geometrical form of the spiral shown in the drawings is given b the formula r a . wnere a is a constant, r is the radius and e is the angle about the spiral axis.The frequency of resonance depends almost exclusively on the developed length of the spiral. The impedance of the circuit depends on two ratios, the ratio e d, e being the spacing of the condenser plates and d being the conductor diameter, and the ratio ela. sandwich td circuit has a series of resonant frequencies, as has a transmission line resonator, and can be adapted to a broad range of impedance B, as can anLC circuit. Within its range of applications a sandwich tuned circuit has a better Q than an LC circuit and is much smaller than a coaxial resonator.2. As an ImEdance Transformer ff one of the extremities of the spiral is connected to a given load, the other extremity behaves as a frequency dependent impedance. If the impedance transformer has been constructed according to III lA above, the transformation ratio can vary between 1 to 1 and 1 to 10,000 with exterior impedances in the range of a fraction of an ohm to tens of kilo ohms.A sandwich tuned circuit can be used as a quarter wave, or a multiple quarter wave, resonator and impedance transformer if the effects of parasitic capacity between uindings and of mutual inductance between adjacent windings can be offset. If m is the mutual conductance per unit of length and if c is is the parasitic capacity between adjacent windings per unit length r, it can be shown theoretically, and it has been shown experimentally, that the sandwich circuit will behave as an orthodox transmission line if the geometry of the circuit is such that the following relation is satisfied, Z being the characteristic impedance of the spiral mXc z2 The sandwich tuned cirouit will behave as a tapered transmssion line, and can be used 85 such as an impedance transformer, if a in the expression for r is a function of and if the total spiral length is adapted.The region of application of the circuit may be as wide as frorn 1 MH to 500 MHz. When high power or high Q considerations impose large conductor sizes, conductor bending is a problem above about 100 MHz and a coaxial circuit will give a better Q and handle more power, where as the sandwich circuit will be more compact.At the lower frequency end the reverse is true, an LCcircuit being more compact and the sandwich circuit having a better Q and a better power handling capacity than an LC circuit. Another important characteristic of the sandwich tuned circuit is its ability to adapt to a very broad range of characteristic impedances, from a few ohms to several kilo ohms, whereas transmission line circuits are limited to about 150 ohms.Electrically, a sandwich tuned circuit behaves as a series arrangement of parallel LC circuits. The resonance frequencies of these tuned circuits are almost, but not exact, odd harmonics of a common fundamental frequency. he behavior of the circuit is similar in this respect to the behavior of a resonant quarter wave. 3. As an I.pedance Adapter The tuned circuit, when used as an impedance transformer, behaves as a frequency dependent impedance in a way similar to an LC circuit. Therefore this impedance transformer can be used as an impedance adapter for neutralizing unwanted reactancies such as are encountered in power amplifiers. This adaption can be obtained simultaneously with an impedance transformation or independently.IV. Advantages 1. Efficiency A A normal, class A, broadband amplifier has an efficiency of about 252. The present invention creates the possibility of building broadband power amplifiers with class C characteristics, that is, with efficiencies of around 80 . fi In the frequency range where cavity resonators are too large to be used as tuning circuits and where, for this reason, LC circuits have to be used, a better Q factor, and lower losses, can be obtained with this circuit, than is possible with traditional LC circuits. The sandwich tuned circuit has a Q factor similar to or better than a coaxial resonator. Theoretically its physical dimensions are independent of wavelength. In the contract to a coaxial resonator, it is useful in the region between a few MHz to a few hundreds of MHz. 2. Economy of Available SpaceFor the same frequency and the same power the impedance transformer and resonator of the present invention is far less bulky than either a cavity resonator or an LCcircuit.An important advantage of this type of circuit is the fact that it fits well, mechanically and electrically, around high power transmitting tubes. A power tube can easily be built into a oenter aperture 16 of the tuned circuit in such a way that both together constitute a single compact unit.The three discs of the sandwich, i.e., the two plates and the spiral, may carry very different D.C. potentials. A modern coaxial transmitting tube rits well, coaxially, into the sandwich . The discs of the sandwich can support the electrode contact rings of the tube without interfering with the cooling system and while keeping the electrode stray capacitance at a minimum. In this respect a sandwich tuned circuit is very superior to either a resonant transmission line or a tuned circuit with lumped elements. In the frequenoy region described above a sandwich circuit will always result in a very compact and high performance amplifier stage. In the high power case other circuits will require more space and will implicate more energy losss, in the circuit itself as well as by stray losses. 3. PossibilitIes of ProductionThe construction of this device is quite simple because it comprises only three basic parts that are flat.Electrically, the characteristics of the impedance transformer may be easily controlled.Because all parts are flat it is possible to build transformers that are mathematically complicated, with simple tooling.equipment. In this way unusual electrical characteristics, such as described above, can be obtained easily.4. Possibilities of ew ApplicationsThe present invention creates the possibility of economizing space or energy or both by the replacement of traditional LC circuitm by the present circuit. It also creates the nossibilities for qulte new applications. A whole frequency range, e.g., from approximately 5 to 200 MHz, can be utilized with a single circuit without the necessity of changing taps or tuning settings. It is possible to change frequency of the amplifier while operating and at full load.The impedance transformer and resonator of the present invention is a device that is mechanically simple, is less bulky, and gives a better quality than the circuits it is intended to replace, LC circuits or cavity resonators. The invention also creates the possibility of building broadband high power R.F. amplifiers from narrow band class C amplifiers. Bandwidths of 1. 9 times the central frequency have been attained without appreciable losses of energy.In the roregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific exeroplary embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereunto without departing from the broader spirit and scope or the invention as set rorth in the appended claims. The soecification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.
