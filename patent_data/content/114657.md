## Description
This invention relates to a process for producing hydroxycarboxylic acids. More specifically, this invention relates to a process for producing hydroxycarboxylic acids by reacting aldehyde compounds, carbon monoxide and water in the presence of a crystalline aluminosilicate. Hydroxycarboxylic acids are important compounds which are widely used in the chemical industry. For example, glycolic acid is directly used as a chemical detergent and is also useful as an intermediate for organic syntheses, a raw material for polymers and an additive. Methods have previously been known for producing glycolic acid, a hydroxycarboxylic acid, from formaldehyde as a starting material. They include a method which comprises reacting formaldehyde, water and carbon monoxide under a high pressure using a mineral acid such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and hydrochloric acid as a catalyst to form glycolic acid in one step see, for example, the specifications of U. S. Patents Nos.2,152,852 and 2,153,064 and Japanese Patent PublicationNo. 44,454 1978 and a method which comprises reacting formaldehyde, water and carbon monoxide in the presence of hydrogen fluoride under a high pressure to form glycolic acid in one step see, for example, the specifications of U. S. Patents Nos. 3,754,028 and 3,911,003 andJapanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 13,719 1976 .These methods, however, have proved to be of little use in the chemical industry because they require a complex operation for separating glycolic acid from the reaction mixture, the mineral acids and hydrogen fluoride used as catalysts are difficult to recover from the reaction mixture for re use, and acid resistant reactors are necessary to withstand the strong acidity of the catalysts. The specification of Japanese Patent PublicationNo. 37,332 1978 discloses a method for producing hydroxycarboxylic acids which comprises reacting aliphatic aldehydes and carbon monoxide in a liquid reaction medium in the presence of a solid insoluble granular acid catalyst. As the insoluble granular acid catalyst used in this method, this patent document specifically shows clay minerals such as kaolinite, halloysite, smectite, illite, vermiculite, chlorite, sepiolite, attapulgite and palygorskite, and acid catalysts derived from montomorillonite and natural or synthetic mordenites. It does not disclose FZ l or ZSM type zeolites. Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No.122,321 1981 discloses a method for producing an ether or ester of glycolic acid which comprises reacting formaldehyde, carbon monoxide and a formic acid ester in the presence of a strong acid catalyst. Examples of the strong acid catalyst which are show in this patent document are Brnsted acids such as mineral acids and organic acids, Lewis acids such as boron trifluoride, strongly acidic cationic exchange resins having sulfonic acid groups as functional groups, clay minerals, zeolites, solidified acids resulting from supporting of phosphoric acid or boric acid on carriers, inorganic oxides, inorganic salts and double oxides.This patent document only describes montmorillonite, kaolinite, bentonite, halloysite, smectite, illite, vermiculite, chlorite, sepiolite, attapulgite, palygorskite and mordenite as specific examples of the clay minerals and zeolite natural zeolite . It is an object of this invention to provide a novel process for producing hydroxycarboxylic acids denoting both hydroxycarboxylic acids and derivatives thereof . Another object of this invention is to provide a process for producing hydroxycarboxylic acids industrially advantageously. Still another object of this invention is to provide a process for producing hydroxycarboxlic acids industrially advantageously by using a specified crystalline aluminosilicate catalyst which has high catalytic activity, high heat resistance heatproof property and a long life and is easy to handle. Yet another object of this invention is to provide a process for producing hydroxycarboxylic acids industrially advantageously, in which a high conversion of the starting aldehyde compound and a high selectivity for the hydroxyzarboxylic acids can be achieved. Further objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the following descr iption. These objects and advantages of this invention are achieved in accordance with this invention by a process for producing hydroxycarboxylic acids which comprises reacting an aldehyde compound, carbon monoxide and water in a reaction medium, said reaction being carried out in the presence of a crystalline aluminosilicate whose X ray diffraction pattern shows at least five clear diffraction lines at a diffraction angle 29 of 7.90 0.30, 8.80 0.30, 23.20 0.30, 23.70 0.30, and 24.40 0.30 while the concentration of the aldehyde compound in the reaction mixture is maintained at not more than 15 by weight based on the total weight of the aldehyde compound and the reaction medium. The aldehyde compound used in the process of this invention may be aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic.Aliphatic aldehydes are commercially preferred. It may be a monoaldehyde or a polyaldehyde such as a dialdehyde. Preferably, the aliphatic aldehyde can be represented by the following formula R1 CHO ..... 1 wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom or an aliphatic hydrocarbon group. Preferably, the alicyclic aldehyde can be represented by the following formula R2 CHO CHO 2 R2 wherein R2 represents an alicyclic group. Preferably, the aromatic aldehyde can be represented by the following formula R3 CHO ..... 3 wherein R represents a carbocyclic aromatic group. The aliphatic hydrocarbon group R1 in general formula 1 may be linear or branched, and saturated or unsaturated. Generally, aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having 1 to 10 carbon atoms are preferred, and alkyl groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms are especially preferred. Examples of the aliphatic hydrocarbon groups include methyl, ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl,sn butyl and iso butyl groups. Thus, examples of the aliphatic aldehyde include formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, n butyraldehyde and iso butyraldehyde. Of these, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde are preferred. Formaldehyde is especially preferred. Formaldehyde may be fed into the reaction system as such or in the form of paraformaldehyde, alpha polyoxymethylene, trioxane, tetraoxane, etc., or as formalin preferably an aqueous solution containing at least 37 of formaldehyde . The alicyclic group R2 in general formula 2 may be saturated or unsaturated. Preferably, the alicyclic group is a 5 or 6 membered aliphatic carbocyclic groups. Examples are cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl groups. Thus, examples of the alicyclic aldehyde are cyclopentanecarbaldehyde formyl cyclopentane and cyclohexanecarbaldehyde formyl cyclohexane . The carbocyclic aromatic group R3 in general formula 3 is preferably a benzene ring or a naphthalene ring. Examples of the aromatic aldehyde are benzaldehyde, naphthaldehyde and terephthaldehyde. Carbon monoxide used in the reaction is not only highly pure carbon monoxide, but also carbon monoxide containing nitrogen, hydrogen, and or carbon dioxide which do not affect the reaction. The basic reaction in accordance with this invention can be represented by the following reaction formula when the aldehyde compound is formaldehyde.EMI5.1 In addition to the aldehyde compound and carbon monoxide, water participates as one reactant in the reaction of this invention. The process of this invention is carried out in the presence of a reaction medium. Preferably, the reaction medium is a neutral or acidic substance which is liquid under the reaction conditions. Examples of preferred reaction media include lower aliphatic carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid, halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride, esters between lower aliphatic carboxylic acids and lower aliphatic alcohols such as ethyl acetate and methyl propionate, lower aliphatic alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and propanol, water, and mixtures of these. Of these, the lower aliphatic carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid are especially preferred.Water in the amount required for the reaction is usually introduced into the reaction system while it is carried, for example, by a source of the aldehyde and or the reaction medium. Preferably, the concentration of water is not more than 30 by weight based on the total weight of the aldehyde and the reaction medium. In the process of this invention, it is essential that the concentration of the aldehyde compound in the reaction mixture be maintained at not more than 15 , preferably 5 to 15 , especially preferably 5 to 12 , based on the total weight of the aldehyde compound and the reaction medium. By maintaining the concentration of the aldehyde compound in the reaction mixture at not mora than 15 , a high conversion of the aldehyde compound and a high selectivity for the hydroxycarboxylic acid can be achieved in the reaction system of this invention. A crystalline aluminosilicate is used as a catalyst in the process of this invention. The crystalline aluminosilicate catalyst is characterized by the fact that in its X ray diffraction pattern, it shows at least five clear diffraction lines at a diffraction angle 2 of 7.90 0.30, 8.80 0.30, 23.20 0.30, 23.70 0.30, and 24.4 10.3 . Any crystalline aluminosilicates having the above specified five clear diffraction lines can be used in this invention even when they additionally have other diffraction lines at other diffraction angles. The X ray diffraction analysis is effected by a standard powder diffraction method using CuKa radiation. The crystalline aluminosilicates used in this invention have a specified cage structure and at least contain silicon, oxygen and aluminum atoms. Crystalline aluminosilicates which additionally contain a metal atom of Group III of the periodic table such as boron or a transition metal atom such as chromium may be used in th is invention if they are characterized by the aforesaidX ray diffraction pattern. Examples of suitable crystalline aluminosilicates used in the invention are FZ l zeolites, FZ l zeolites containing transition metals and ZSM type zeolites typified by ZSM 5 zeolite, which are described, for example, in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publications Nos.88,820 1981 and 15,023 1983 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 18,521 1978, respectively. It should be understood that the disclosures of these patent documents about zeolite constitute part of the disclosure of the present application. FZ l zeolite and ZSM 5 zeolite used especially preferably as the catalyst of this invention are charac terized by having clear diffraction lines at the following diffraction angles 29 . FZ l ZSM 5 7.9 7.96 8.8 8.84 17.7 23.10 23.2 24.00 23.7 24.45 23.9 24.4 The crystalline aluminosilicate used in this invention acts as an acid catalyst in the reaction system. Preferably, therefore, the crystalline aluminosilicate is used after it has been subjected to an activating treatment. For example, a crystalline aluminosilicate of the FZ l series is activated by calcining it, treating the calcined product with an aqueous solution of hydrogen chloride under reflux, drying it, and after optionally subjecting it to ion exchange in a customary manner, calcining it again. The ZSM type zeolite is activated by calcining it, treating the calcined product with an aqueous solution of ammonium chloride under reflux, drying it and then calcining it. The crystalline aluminosilicate used in the process of this invention has high catalytic activity in a reaction for producing hydroxycarboxylic acids from an aldehyde compound, carbon monoxide and water. Hence, even when it is used, for example, in an amount which provides a hydrogen ion concentration of about 0.5 millimole per mole of the aldehyde, it exhibits sufficient catalytic activity. in the reaction of this invention. Since the crystalline aluminosilicate can be easily separated and recovered from the reaction mixture after the reaction without any substantial loss, it can be caused to be present in the reaction system in a relatively large amount and the rate of the reaction can therefore be increased. According to the process of this invention, the crystalline aluminosilicate can be used in an amount of not more than 10 by weight based on the total weight of the aldehyde compound and the reaction medium in a batch system or continuous system in a suspended or fluidized bed. The process of this invention can be carried out in any type of reactor such as a tank, packed tower, fixed bed reactor, suspended bed reactor or fluidized bed reactor. Because the crystalline aluminosilicate used in this invention has high activity in the reaction for producing hydroxycarboxylic acids, a satisfactory rate of reaction can be achieved even when the process of this invention is carried out in a continuous system which is industrially advantageous. The reaction can be carried out usually at a temperature of 100 to 3000C. Temperatures of 180 to 250 0C are especially preferred because the crystalline aluminosilicate catalyst exhibits high activity at these temperatures. The reaction can be carried out at atmospheric pressure, but preferably under elevated pressures of usually at least 100 kg cm2. By the basic reaction of this invention as illustrated hereinabove, a hydroxycarboxylic acid represented by the following formulaEMI9.1 wherein R is R1, R2 or R3, and R1, R2 and R3 are as defined above, is formed from the aldehyde compound of the following formula R CHO ..... 5 wherein R is as defined above, carbon monoxide and water. R in formula 4 differs depending upon the aldehyde compound used. For example, it is a hydrogen atom for formaldehyde, a methyl group for acetaldehyde and a phenyl group for benzaldehyde. The hydroxycarboxylic acid of formula 4 is obtained as the corresponding hydroxycarboxylic acid derivative depending upon the kind of the reaction medium used. Investigations of the present inventors have shown that by the process of this invention, hydroxy carboxylic.acids represented by the following formulaEMI9.2 wherein R is as defined above, R4 represents a hydrogen atom or an aliphatic hydrocarbon group, and R5 represents a hydrogen atom or an ali phatic acyl group, can be produced preferably. R4 and or 5 differ depending upon the reaction medium used. For example, when methanol is used as the reaction medium, a product of formula 6 in which one of R4 and R5 is a methyl group and the other is a hydrogen atom or both R4 and R5 are methyl groups is formed. When acetic acid is used as the reaction medium, there is formed a product of formula 6 in which one of R4 and R5 is an acetyl group and the other is a hydrogen atom or both R4 and R5 are acetyl groups.Table 1 below summarizes the relation among the starting aldehyde compounds, the reaction medium and the reaction products.

Reactions using insoluble solid catalysts such as heteropolyacids or ion exchange resins which were recently proposed have not been studied in regard to operations in continuous type reactors, Investigations of the present inventors have shown that the activity of these solid catalysts is much lower than that of the crystalline aluminosilicates used in the present invention, and they do not give the expected results in a continuous operation. Specifically, the present inventors have found that in the continuous system, the reaction does not so much proceed in the presence of ion exchange resins, but the crystalline aluminosilicates specified in the present invention can give very good results of the reaction. Since the crystalline aluminosilicate catalyst used in this invention has high heat resistance, it lends itself to easy handling and reaction operation. Furthermore, its high catalytic activity gives hydroxycarboxylic acids in good space time yields. The crystalline aluminosilicate catalyst of this invention can be used over a long period of time because it can retain its high catalytic activity over a long period of time without being attacked by the solvent. The catalyst of this invention is easy to separate and recover from the reaction mixture after the reaction, and can be re used. By the process of this invention, both the conversion of the aldehyde compound and the selectivity for the hydroxycarboxylic acids are increased. Moreover, besides the batch system, other systems of reaction such as a continous system can be used in practicing the process of this invention. All of the foregoing advantages make the process of this invention very valuable in industrial practice. The following examples illlustrate the present invention more specifically.
