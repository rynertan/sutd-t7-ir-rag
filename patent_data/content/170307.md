# Nuclear magnetic resonance apparatus having a communication system.

## Abstract
In a nuclear magnetic resonance apparatus, a loudspeak er element 30 free of magnetic material acts as an acoustic reproduction element arranged in the magnet space for which the main field of the magnet acts to generate a Lorentz driving force. Together with a microphone function or an additional microphone 50 and an external loudspeaker microphone system, a two way acoustic communication system can thus be formed. Such a loudspeaker element free from magnetic material does not produce field disturbances in the magnet.
