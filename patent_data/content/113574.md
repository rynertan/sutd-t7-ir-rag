# Gas selectively permeable membrane and method of forming said membrane.

## Abstract
A gas selectively permeable membrane and a method of forming said membrane are described. This membrane is an asymmetrical pore diameter structure film made of a polyetherimide having the recurring unit represented by formula A or a mixture of said polyetherimide and at least one polymer having the recurring unit represented by formula B , wherein the mean pore diameter of a dense layer of the asymmetrical pore diameter structure film is 0.5 micron or less and the mean thickness of the dense layer is 10 microns or less
