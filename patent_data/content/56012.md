# HERBICIDE APPLICATOR SYSTEM

## Abstract
A metering tube 50 injects liquid herbicide into the central flow passage 48 of a fluid permeable rope 14 . The liquid herbicide flows along the length of the rope and is emitted from the inside of the rope to its outside surface. The metering tube 50 is supplied from an accumulator tank 62 in which a volume of the liquid herbicide is pressured by compressed air. The liquid herbicide 64 in the accumulator tank 62 is maintained at a selected pressure by a charge of compressed air delivered from a storage tank 20 through a pressure regulator valve 80 to the accumulator tank. The metering tube 50 is lodged within the central flow passage 48 of the rope applicator 14 and a ferrule fastener 54 compressively engages the rope section surrounding the metering tube 50 , thereby defining an annular seal which allows the flow of liquid herbicide through the metering tube 50 while preventing the flow of liquid herbicide by wicking action through the end of the rope. This arrangement provides close control of the flow rate of liquid herbicide into the rope applicator 14 , and is not dependent upon the variables associated with wicking flow.
