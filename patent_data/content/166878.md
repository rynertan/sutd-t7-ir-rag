## Description
This invention relates to biological fluid testing instruments, and is particularly useful for vision impaired persons for determining the concentration of a medically significant component of their body fluids, such as glucose content of blood. Various types of equipment are known for conducting what is known as reflected light photometry, in which the reflectivity of a so called objective area of a test strip is determined. The objective area is specifically dedicated for the determination of a certain property, for example, concentration of a medically significant component of a biological fluid such as blood or urine. The component which is studied is rendered capable of study through a reaction that occurs on the test strip. The objective area undergoes a reflectivity change as a result of the reaction of a reagent material on the objective area with the component of the biological fluid. This change in reflectivity is evaluated to determine the concentration of the medically significant component in the biological fluid. The utilization of test strips and associated instruments to determine medically significant quantitative parameters is known. High precision instruments for achieving quantitative determinations of this type are available. There is, for example, the REFLOCHECK The particular problem to which the present invention is addressed is that many such instruments for the quantitative determination of concentrations of medically significant components of biological fluids are used by people whose vision is impaired. An example is the diabetic with failing sight due to diabetes who must monitor his blood glucose. The use of instruments of this type by people with impaired vision is rendered more difficult by the problems such people have preparing blood samples for reaction on test strips and reading by such instruments. Frequently, vision impaired users place too little blood, or too much blood, on the test strip resulting in inaccurate instrument readings. According to the present invention, the apparatus of claim 1 is provided for forming droplets of blood. Illustratively, the lower edge of the first surface which hereinafter also is termed first edge is a vertically lower edge and the upper edge which hereinafter also is termed second edge is a vertically upper edge. The blood is removed from the body of the user by pricking the skin, milking the body surface in the region in which the skin is pricked across the second edge of the first surface to supply to the first surface a small amount of blood which flows downward across the first surface toward the point, where it forms into the droplet of generally uniform size. Additionally, according to an illustrative embodiment, the second surface is the surface of the objective area of a test strip, and contains a reagent for a medically significant component of the body fluid. Further according to an illustrative embodiment, the droplet must be of a controlled, generally uniform size to insure an appropriate reaction rate between the reagent and the medically significant component of the body fluid. According to a preferred embodiment a system comprising the blood transfer apparatus and an evaluation instrument is provided. The instrument comprises means for indicating a physical characteristic or parameter of medical significance of a body fluid including means for generating an audible indication of the physical characteristic or parameter. Illustratively, the physical characteristic or parameter is glucose content. According to an illustrative embodiment of the invention, the instrument comprises means for generating a data signal related to the reflectance of a reacted test strip. Additionally according to an illustrative embodiment of the invention, the means for generating the audible indication of glucose content comprises a speech generator and means for coupling the speech generator to the data signal generator for reporting the reflectance output as glucose content. Additionally, according to a further embodiment of the invention, the apparatus further comprises a light source, a photodetector and means for mounting the light source and photodetector vertically above the test strip a distance such that formation of a droplet of blood of a generally uniform size on the test strip interrupts the passage of light between the light source and photodetector. According to an illustrative embodiment, the apparatus further includes means responsive to the interruption of light to produce a first audible indication that a droplet of the generally uniform size has been formed on the test strip. Further according to an illustrative embodiment, the apparatus comprises means for timing an interval following the first audible indication and for producing a second audible indication that the reaction between the reagent on the test strip and the blood glucose has reached a point at which the glucose content is to be read. The invention may best be understood by referring to the following description and accompanying drawings which illustrate the invention. In the drawings The system of the present invention, as best illustrated in Fig. 1, is housed in a case 10 including a base 12 and a hinged lid 14. The base 12 includes compartments for alcohol wipes 16, cotton balls 18, a plug in power adapter 20, a tool 22 for puncturing the skin of a user, a plurality of heads 24 for use in conjunction with puncture tool 22 to adjust the depth of the puncture, sterile lancettes 26 for use in conjunction with tool 22 and heads 24 to perform the puncture, a container 28 for reagent carrying test strips, a calendar 30, a test strip reading unit 32 such as the REFLOCHECK Turning now to Figs. 2 4, the blood transfer apparatus 36 includes a mounting base 38 with a flat generally planar forward region 40 and a rear wall 42 which extends along two parallel sides 44, 46 and across the back of the mounting base 38 to define a forwardly opening region 50. Base 38 is illustratively constructed from an easily cleanable material such as, for example, ABS synthetic resin. Base 38 includes locator pins 52, 54 molded along the opposite parallel sides 44, 46 of the mounting base 38 forward of the forward terminations of wall 42. Blood transfer assembly fixture 36 also includes a blood transfer base 56. Tapered holes 61 open into the bottom 62 of the blood transfer base 56, for receiving locator pins 52, 54, respectively to locate base 56 on the fixture base 38. Side walls 58, 60 also include finger grip recesses 64 which facilitate removal of blood transfer base 56 from fixture base 38 for cleaning. The top surface of blood transfer base 56 includes a forward generally upwardly concave region 66 and a rearward generally planar region 68. Region 68 lies generally within the region 50 formed by wall 42 when the blood transfer base 56 is positioned on locator pins 52, 54 and moved downwardly into fixture base 38. An upwardly concave groove 70 extends rearward from the front of the blood transfer base 56. In the region 66 of the base 56, a narrow, flat land region 72 is provided between each side edge of groove 70 and the adjacent upwardly concave portion 66 of the base. The blood transfer base 56 includes a stop 74 formed rearward of the rear end of groove 70. A funnel 76 is hinged to the wall 58 providing the forward upwardly concave region 66 of blood transfer base 56 by a stainless steel hinge pin 78 which is press fitted through a downwardly extending ear 80 formed on a side wall of the funnel 76, and an aligned hole provided in the side wall 58. The opposite side wall ear 82 of funnel 76 extends downward farther onto the opposite side wall 60 forming region 66. This opposite side wall 60 is provided with a part spherical recess 84, illustrated in broken lines in Figs. 2 3, forming one component of a latch mechanism. Other components of the latch mechanism include an elongated handle 86 which is molded as part of the funnel 76 on ear 82, and a ball plunger mechanism including a spring 88 loaded ball 90. The ball plunger is housed within a generally right circular cylindrical hole which extends axially of the handle 86. The ball 90 engages the part spherical recess 84 when the funnel 76 is pivoted in the direction of the arrow in Fig. 2 to latch the funnel 76 in the downward position. The funnel 76 is provided with a downwardly extending projection 92 between ears 80, 82, such that, when the funnel 76 is in its downward position and latched, the projection 92 extends to substantially the same vertical height as the land regions 72 on either side of the groove 70. The funnel 76 includes a rearwardly facing surface 94 including a lower edge 96 terminating at a point 98 directly above the transverse center of groove 70. Surface 94 also includes an upper edge 100 formed by the intersection of surface 94 with an upwardly concave upper surface 102 of the funnel 76. The blood transfer assembly 36 works in the following manner a reagent bearing test strip 104 is removed from container 28 and inserted longitudinally of blood transfer base 56 to be supported on the lands 72 on either side of groove 70. The strip 104 is inserted into the blood transfer base 56 until it encounters the stop 74 at the rearward end thereof. The funnel 76 is then pivoted downward until the ball 90 engages recess 84, locking the funnel 76 in the downward position. In this position, the projection 92 holds the strip 104 fairly securely against the lands 72, so that the position of the strip 104 is fairly fixed. The skin of the finger of the user is then pricked, using the puncture tool 22, one of heads 24 and one of lancettes 26 in known manner. The region of the finger around the opening in the skin is then worked or milked across the somewhat finger shaped upwardly concave surface 102, as indicated by arrow 105 in Fig. 3, to collect blood along edge 100. The blood scraped from the skin and collected along edge 100 moves under the influence of gravity down the surface 94 and, owing to gravity and the surface tension of the blood, forms into a substantially uniformly sized droplet at the point 98 directly above the reagent bearing region 105 of test strip 104. The blood droplet of substantially uniform size drops from point 98 onto the reagent bearing region 105 of strip 104 which is positioned directly beneath point 98 by the lands 72 and stop pin 74. Importantly, the user of the equipment has not had to be able to see to perform any of the operations previously described. These operations can all be performed routinely using the sense of touch only. To provide the user with an indication when a droplet of suitable proportions has been deposited on the test strip 104, so that the user can stop milking a finger across edge 100 and prevent too large a drop from occurring on strip 104, the monitoring base 38 is provided with a photoemitter 106 and photodetector 108. Photoemitter 106 is provided in side wall 46. Photodetector 108 is provided in side wall 44. The photoemitter 106 and photodetector 108 are aligned axially, are positioned vertically along side walls 44, 46 at sufficient heights to insure that a droplet of the appropriate size will interrupt the current of light passing between the photoemitter 106 and photodetector 108, and are both recessed into their respective side walls 44, 46 to insure minimal interference from ambient light. As will be appreciated, the droplet breaks the current of light from photoemitter 106 to photodetector 108 as it falls onto the reagent bearing region of test strip 104. As the droplet spreads, its vertical height decreases slightly, until its surface tension balances the gravitational force tending to flatten the droplet. Accordingly, the light current between the photoemitter 106 and photodetector 108 frequently will be reestablished after the droplet of uniform size has been deposited on test strip 104. To insure that this does not affect the operation of the system, the photodetector 108 typically is one exhibiting some hysteresis. The strips 104 generally are dated, since many of the reagents with which test strips are provided can age. Aging can affect the ability of the reagents in test strips to react with medically significant components of biological fluids. The calendar 30 of Fig. 1 is provided in recognition of this fact. Calendar 30 includes a number of magnetically backed numerals, four 110, 112, 114, 116 of which can be displayed at any given time on upper surface 118 of base 12. A magnetic strip is provided on surface 118 which cooperates with the backs of the numerals. The left most numeral 110 as viewed in Fig. 1 is the more significant digit of the month in which the test strips 104 expire. Numeral 112 is the less significant digit of this month. Numeral 114 is the more significant digit of a two digit year representation. Numeral 116 is the less significant digit of the two digit year representation. The numerals are raised, making them easily readable by users with impaired vision. The general operation of the system and the readout from the blood glucose monitor 32 will now be explained with reference to the electronic circuitry of Figs. 5a 5b. The base 12 houses the photoemitter 106 and photodetector 108 as previously discussed. The illustrative photoemitter 106 is a light emitting diode LED and photodetector 108 is typically an integrated circuit including a phototransistor, an amplifier and a wave shaping circuit.

The base 12 is provided with an unregulated battery source 150, illustratively comprising a pair of 9V batteries in parallel. The output terminal 152 of battery 150 provides 9V with respect to circuit ground A switch 154 controls the availability of 9V at terminal 152. If external power is available, the plug in power adapter 20 of Fig. 1 can be used. Adapter 20 is a 120 VAC to 9VDC converter with a plug in jack 155. Jack 155 disconnects battery 150 from the circuit when the jack is plugged into the switch 154 as shown in broken lines in Fig. 5a. The battery 150 also provides power to the blood glucose monitor 32 through terminals 156, 158.
