# Irrigation sleeve and attachment therefor.

## Abstract
An irrigation sleeve 18 for colostomy patients is adapted such that it can be selectivelv and removeably attached to any one of a plurality of different snap on attachments, such as an irrigation attachment 20 or a rinsing or flushing attachment. The sleeve 18 is basically funnelshaped so that it may more effectively direct the flow or irrigating fluid and waste material therethrough. The sleeve 18 has an opening 30 adapted to receive a stoma 16 of a colostomy patient 14 and an opening 32 adapted to receive one of the attachments 20 . The opening 32 for the attachments 20 can be moved out of alignment with the opening 30 for the stoma 16 in order to inhibit soiling of the attachment 20 by irrigating fluid and waste material discharged from the stoma 16 without requiring the attachment 20 to be removed from the sleeve 18 .
