# Process for the preparation of master batches of peroxides in polymers.

## Abstract
Master batches comprising 20 60 by weight of an organic peroxide and 40 80 by weight of polymer capable of being cross linked, such as EPDM or EVA. At a tempera ture of 15 to 95 C polymer particles are contacted with a medium comprising 2 100 by weight of a peroxide which is liquid at said temperature and 0 98 by weight of a liquid such as water in which the peroxide and the polymer are not or hardly soluble. This medium must, however, not be a physically stable emulsion and is to be used in an amount such that after the incorporation of the peroxide almost all polymer particles are still completely surrounded by the liquid medium.
