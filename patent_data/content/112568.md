# Glass reinforced polymer composition.

## Abstract
A glass reinforced polymer composition of the invention contains 80 to 99.99 parts by weight, of a 4 methyl 1 pentene polymer, 0.01 to 20 parts by weight of a graft modified polymer of 4 methyl 1 pentene having graft units of an unsaturated car boxylic acid or an acid anhydride thereof in an amount of 0.5 to 15 by weight and having a limiting viscosity of 0.3 to 10 dl g, and 1 to 300 parts by weight of glass fibers based on 100 parts by weight of the sum of the 4 methyl 1 pentene polymer and the graft modified polymer. The composition has overall stan dards of mechanical strength, heat resistance and water re sistance.
