# Method for enhancing one or more mechanical properties of partially crystalline thermoplastics.

## Abstract
A method is disclosed for enhancing at least one of the mechanical properties of a partially crystalling thermoplastic by forming a dispersion of a polydiorganosiloxane within the thermoplastic, and extending the resultant dispersion. Ulti mate tensile strength, modulus, and ultimate elongation can be enhanced in comparison with the same thermoplastic with no added polydiorganosiloxane and no extension.
