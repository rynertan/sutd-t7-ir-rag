# METHOD FOR PREPARING FIRED REFRACTORY CEMENT

## Abstract
A novel raw batch and improved fired refractory cement is described. A bulk refractory grain mass is initially bonded with a fired bond, which upon being fired includes Si₃N₄ and or Si₂ON₂ reaction component that better protects the ultimate high temperature sintered cement product from erosion when the cement is used as a liner for furnace walls, troughs, and runners that contain a flow of molten iron or slag, as well as induction furnaces which process corrosive slag.
