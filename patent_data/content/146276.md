## Description
Programnable Computer Keyboard This invention relates to data entry devices for computers, and in particular to keyboard devices. The word computer will be used herein to describe all types of data and word processing equipment, and the word keyboard is to be understood in its widest possible sense, that is to say in the sense of any device adapted for the manual input of data into such a system. Conventional keyboards are generally provided with an array of key switch devices, each of which is adapted to generate a particular character or code, such as an ASCII character, when the key switch is depressed. When the keyboard is employed as part of a terminal device to a computer, the code may be generated from a read only memory in the terminal device, or the device may be provided with a programmable memory, so that the code generated by each key can be controlled by the user. Generally speaking, only a few of the keys in one particular row of the keyboard can be programmed in this way, and since conventional key caps are permanently engraved with legends respectively indicating the function of each key, it is necessary for the user to memorise the function which has been programmed into each key, or to change the key cap whenever the function is changed.Consequently, such programmable keyboards can be difficult to use in practice. Recently, terminals have been developed which can be program tried to display function labels for the keys on a part of theVDU, or even on a small auxiliary display device on the keyboard itself, such as a liquid crystal display. However, all of these known devices suffer from the disadvantage that it is necessary to allocate some space on the main display, or to enlarge the keyboard by providing an additional display on the keyboard, in order to accommodate the function labels. Accordingly, the present invention seeks to provide a compact programmable keyboard which is so constructed as to allow individual key functions to be programmed, and also to allow suitable labels for the functions to be displayed. To this end, the present invention provides a key switch for a manual data input device, including an actuator part 6 adapted to generate an output and incorporating an integral display device which is programmable to display a legend indicative of the function of the key. The invention also extends to an assembly of such key switches which are arranged in an array so as to form a keyboard.and memory means adapted to store a plurality of different sets of functions and corresponding legends for the keys of the keyboard, so as to provide various different keyboard layouts. The invention also extends to a keyboard for manual input of data to a computer, comprising an array of programmable display devices and a flexible membrane overlay having a respective transparent contact portion overlying each display device whereby the application of pressure to the membrane over one of the display devices causes a corresponding signal to be generated by the keyboard. Some embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic perspective view of a first type of key switch in accordance with the invention Figure 2 is a diagrammatic exploded view of part of a second type of key switch in accordance with the invention Figure 3 is a vertical cross section through a key switch array made up of elements of the type shown in Figure 2 Figure 4 is a plan view of part of the array of Figure 3 Figure 5 is a diagrammatic exploded view of a third type of key switch in accordance with the invention Figure 6 is a vertical cross section through an array of devices in accordance with Figure 5 and Figure 7 is a plan view, partly broken away, of the array of Figure 6. Referring firstly to Figure 1, this shows a conventional key switch device 2, including a fixed base 4 which is adapted to be attached to a motherboard, and a central upstanding pillar 6, slidable vertically in a socket 8 in the base, which normally carries an engraved key cap at its upper end. Depression of the key cap, and therefore the pillar 6, actuates the switch so as to provide an output from it. In accordance with this embodiment of the invention, however, the normal plastic engraved key cap is replaced by a clipon liquid crystal display unit 10, which is connected to the motherboard by means of a flexible connector 12. In this way, the key switch can be programmed so that, in addition to producing the defined function as an output when the key switch is depressed, it also displays on its upper surface, a legend indicating the nature of the function. As an alternative to the use of conventional key switches, the invention also envisages the use of membrane type keyboards, comprising conductive layers. In this type of arrangement, as shown in Figure 2, an LCD unit 14 to display a key legend is attached to a motherboard not shown , and the transparent membrane switch 16 overlays it. As shown in Figures 3 and 4, such an arrangement comprises a series of parallel transparent strips 18, 20, etc, overlaying another series of parallel strips 22, 24, 26, etc which extend at right angles to the first set. Transparent spacers 28, 30, etc are provided between the crossover positions 32, 34, to keep the X and Y layers separated in between these areas, and in the crossover positions themselves, depression of the upper layer causes it to touch the lower layer, thus generating a coordinate indicating which switch has been actuated.The LCD unit 14 Figure 2 provides a plurality of character displaying elements 36, enabling a particular legend to be programmed into the respective key area. Since the conductive layers 18, 20, and 22, 24, etc are transparent, these legends can be seen through them. Figure 5 shows another alternative arrangement, which is generally similar to that of Figures 2 to 4, except that in this case the viewing area 38 for each key switch is separate from the actual contact area 40. The LCD unit 42, which provides the character display 44, is arranged beneath the top and bottom conductive layers comprising the X and Y elements of the matrix, in the same way as in Figures 2 to 4, but in this case the X and Y layers are only transparent in the area 38, and are formed with facing interdigitated contact areas 46, in the region 40. When an operator presses the key area, the interdigitated contact areas are brought into contact so as to produce an output from the switch.
