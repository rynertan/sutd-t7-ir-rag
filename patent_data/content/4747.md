## Description
Title Oligomeric Phosphate Ester Compositions Method of Preparation and Use in Production of Polyurethane Foams The present invention relates to oligomeric phosphate esters compositions which have flame retardant properties, to a method for preparing such oligomeric esters and to the use thereof in the production of polyurethanes. Oligomeric phosphate esters are known and are described in U.S. Patent No. 3,767,732. The 732 patent discloses compositions having the structural formula EMI1.1 wherein a stands for 1 or 0, n stands for a number between O and 4, R1 stands for at least one halogenated hydrocarbon radical and at least one hydroxylated radical of the structural formula EMI1.2 and R2 stands for a radical of the structural formula EMI2.1 The substituents R3 and R4 respectively stand for a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms and being halogen substituted, if desired, and m stands for a number between 1 and 10. The method of preparing the compositions of the 732 patent comprises reacting a compound of the structural formula EMI2.2 wherein R5 is chloroethyl or 2,3 dibromopropyl and b is 0 or 1 in the presence of between about 0.1 and 2 percent of a phosphorus acid stabilizer and between about 0.1 and 2 percent of disodium phosphate with a polyphosphoric acid or a mixture thereof with P205.A reaction mixture of partially esterified polyphosphoric acids is prepared by this step. The reaction mixture is then further reacted with an epoxide having the structural formula EMI2.3 wherein R3 and R4 are as defined above until said partially esterified polyphosphoric acids are completely esterified. The product is a reactive flame retardant having. hydroxyl numbers from about 100 to 300 milligrams of KOH per gram of product. It is known that reactive flame retard ants are undesirable for flexible polyurethane foams. They are detrimental fo the flexibility of the foams and can cause other undesirable side effects to the foam properties. In accordance with the present invention, flame retardant oligomeric phosphate esters having hydroxyl numbers from 1 to about 25 milligrams of KOH per gram of product are prepared. These oligomers have excellent flame retardancy characteristics as additive flame retardants for flexible polyurethane foams.Their additive nature prevents damage to the physical characteristics of flexible polyurethane foams.Furthermore, their oligomeric nature substantially reduces leaching of the flame retardant from the foam thereby obviating a common undesirable characteristic of non oligomeric additive flame retardants. The method of the present invention comprises first reacting P205 with a trialkyl or tris haloalkyl phosphate in the presence of about 0.01 to about 5 of a phosphite at a temperature from about OCC. to about 2000C. The reaction product is a mixed polyphosphate ester containing P O P bonds which is then reacted with an epoxide. Alternatively, P205 is first reacted with a trialky or tris haloalkyl phosphite at a temperature from about OOC. to about 2000C. The reaction product is a mixed polyphosphate polyphosphite ester containingP O P bonds which is oxidised with air or oxygen to yield a polyphosphate ester having P O P bonds which is then reacted with an epoxide. A Lewis acid catalyst or an alcohol or both are employed during the epoxide reaction to insure complete reaction of latent acidity groups. Volatile materials are removed following the epoxide reaction. The present invention therefore provides an oligomeric phosphate ester composition of the structural formula EMI4.1 wherein R is C1 C10 alkyl or haloalkyl, R1 and R2 can be the same or different and are hydrogen or C1 C10 alkyl or haloalkyl and n is an integer from zero to about 10, said composition having a hydroxyl number from 1 to about 25 milligrams of KOH per gram. Exemplary R groups include but are not limited to the following EMI4.2 Exemplary R1 and R2 groups include but are not limited to the following H CCl3 CH2CH2C1 CH3 CZ2Br CH CCl2 CHzCH3 CHBr2 CHClCH2Cl CH 2C1 CH2CCl3 CH2OCH2CHClCH2Cl CHC19 CH2CHCl2 CH2OCH2CHBrCH2Br EMI5.1 The method of preparing the oligomeric phosphate esters of the present invention comprises first reacting P205 with a trialkyl or tris haloalkyl phosphate having the structural formula EMI5.2 wherein R is the same as defined above. This reaction is conducted at a temperature from about 0 0C. to about 2000C. in the presence of about 0.01 to about 5 of a phosphite having the structural formula III P OR wherein R is the same as defined above. Alternatively, P205 can be reacted with a trialkyl phosphite having the structural formula III at a temperature from about 0 C. to about 200 0C. The product is then a mixed polyphosphate polyphosphite ester having P O P bonds which is oxidized by reacting with air or oxygen at a temperature fro about OOC, to about 2000C. The reaction product is a polyphosphate ester having P O P bonds which is then reacted at a temperature from about OOC. to about 2000C with an excess of an epoxide having the structural formula EMI6.1 wherein R1 and R2 are the same as defined above. The excess epoxide insures complete reaction of all P O P bonds. This step can be carried out at elevated pressure to prevent loss of a volatile epoxide. A Lewis acid catalyst or an alcohol or both are employed in amounts from about 0.01 to about 5 during the epoxide reaction to insure complete reaction of latent acidity groups . Suitable Lewis acid catalysts include but are not limited to the following Aluminium chloride Boron trifluoride Tetra isopropyl titanate etherate Boron trifluoride Stannous octoate Boron trifluoride Magnesium chloride Zinc chloride Titanium tetrachloride Antimony trichloride Suitable alcohols include but are not limited to the following CH3O 1 CH3 CH2 n Hi n 2 10 C 2H5 OH BrCH2 3 CCH2OH EMI6.2 OCH2OH Following the epoxide reaction, volatile materials are removed from the reaction product. This can be accomplished by vacuum stripping, nitrogen sparging,CO2 sparging, dry air sparging, or combined vacuum and inert gas sparging. The following equations 1 and 2 are representative of the reaction EMI7.1 wherein R, R1, R2 and n are the same as defined above, or alternatively EMI7.2 EMI7.3 wherein R, R1, R2 and n are as defined above and m is o or 1. Reactants utilized in the method described above are generally employed in suitable ratios to give a product with the desired P, C1, viscosity, and oligomer composition. The ratio of P205 to trialkyl phosphate or tris haloalkyl phosphate, or alternately the ratio of P205 to trialkyl or tris haloalkyl phosphite, can be varied over a wide range. A variety of compositions can be prepared by altering the stoichiometry of reagents. Reaction times can vary over relatively wide ranges and can easily be determined by one skilled in the art. Factors affecting reaction time include reactant and catalyst concentrations and temperature.Increases in temperature and catalyst concentration result in decreased reaction times. Typical reaction times are from about 1 to about 30 hours for each step. The method described above can conveniently be effected by introducing the individual reactants and catalyst into any reaction zone that can be heated to the reaction temperature. The zone is generally provided with a condenser for removal of volatile components. A thermometer, thermocouple or other conventional means.can be used to monitor temperature.The reaction can be carried out in a continuous or batch type system as desired. The products of the reaction are generally purified by removal of volatiles. This can be accomplished by conventional techniques. The identification of products can be achieved by infrared spectra, H nuclear magnetic resonance spectra and 31p nuclear resonance spectra and elemental analysis. Typical yield of the above described method of the present invention are about 100 based on P2 O The hydroxyl number of the products is generally from abot 1 to about 25 milligrams of KOH per gram of product. Accordingly, the products are essentially non reactive in flexible urethane foams. Illustrative of the compounds corresponding to structural formula I which can he prepared by the method of the present invention are EMI9.1 Where n is as defined above. Branched oligomers of the foregoing idealized structures may be also be present. The products of the present invention are useful for various flame retardant applications.
