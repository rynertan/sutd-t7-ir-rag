# Heat transfer printing sheet.

## Abstract
A heat transfer printing sheet 1 comprises a substrate sheet 2 and a heat transfer printing layer 3 superposed thereon. The heat transfer printing layer 3 comprises a polyvinyl butyral resin having specific characteristics as a binder resin and a heat sublimable dye. The dye is transferred to a reception layer 13 supported on a substrate 12 of a heat transferable sheet 11 when the heat transfer printing sheet 1 and the heat transferable sheet 11 are brought into contract, e.g. by roller 15 and subjected to heat, e.g. by heating source 14.
