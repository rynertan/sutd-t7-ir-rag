# Creep torque and lock up control for automatic transmission.

## Abstract
A control device for an automatic transmission com prises an electromagnetic valve that is subject to pulse duty factor control and generates an adjustment pressure vari able in a first pattern after a rod of a shift operation mecha nism has moved into an overstroke range beyond a max imum reduction ratio position. The adjustment pressure is variable in a second pattern when the rod fails to move into the overstroke range. An adjustment pressure change over valve is formed integral with the rod and applies the adjust ment pressure to a servo actuating pressure regulator valve i.e., a throttle valve when the motor vehicle is at a stand still and the engine idles so as to effect a creep torque con trol. When the motor vehicle starts moving at a speed above a ertain vehicle speed, the adjustment pressure change over valve applies the adjustment pressure to a lock up control valve, thereby to effect a lock up control.
