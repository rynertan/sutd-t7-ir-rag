# Flavouring composition and process for producing that composition.

## Abstract
A flavour composition comprises a mixture of sorbitol, mannitol, saccharin, and a flavouring agent contained in the mixture. Preferably the saccharin is present in an amount of 3 by weight of the mannitol. The presence of mannitol and saccharin is believed to lower the congealing temperature of sorbitol, so that volatile flavouring agents may be incorpo rated therein with minimal flavour loss. The present flavouring composition may be prepared in the form of sugar free candies, or may be reduced to particles or beads, having particle sizes appropriate for incorporation into comestible products such as chewing gums. A process for preparing the flavouring composition is also disclosed, which utilizes seed aprticles containing sorbitol, added to the mixture after the flavouring agent to assist in the commencement of hardening.
