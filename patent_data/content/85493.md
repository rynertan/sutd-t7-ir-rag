# Compression screw assembly.

## Abstract
A compression screw assembly for applying compress ion to a fractured bone includes a lag screw 20 , a compression plate 30 including a hollow barrel member 31 adapted to receive the lag screw 20 in at least one fixed orientation, a wrench assembly 50, 70, 80 adapted to releasably engage the lag screw 20 in axial alignment therewith for introducing the screw 20 into the bone, and means 40 having surface contours complimentary with the outer surface 23 of the lag screw 20 and inner surface 34 of the barrel member 31 for being optionally insertable into the barrel member 31 to prevent axial rotation of the lag screw 20 with respect to the barrel member 31 . The means 40 may comprise a clip which has two elongate members which are engageable between flat surface portions 23 on the outer surface of the lag screw and flat surface portions 34 on the inner surface of the barrel member 31 of the compression plate 30 to prevent relative axial rotation between the compression plate 30 and lag screw 20 . In use the clip 40 is mounted on the wrench assembly 50, 70, 80 before the lag screw 20 is engaged in the bone and can then be introduced into the barrel member 31 at the option of the surgeon.
