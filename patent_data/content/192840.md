# Appliance for fixing fractures of the femur.

## Abstract
An appliance for fixing fractures of the femur 12 which comprises an intramedullary nail 10 for implantation in the intramedullary canal of the femur, a cross nail 14 mount able on the intramedullary nail to extend through the neck of the femur and into the head of the femur and a locking screw 20 that screws into a bore 34 formed in the cross nail to fix the cross nail to the intramedullary nail. A D shaped aperture 16 is formed through the cross nail to receive the intrame dullary nail therethrough and the intramedullary nail has a trefoliate cross 18 section to co act with the straight side of the aperture to prevent turning of the intramedullary nail in the aperture 16 . A slit 48 is formed longitudinally through the wall of the intramedullary nail and the bore 34 that receives the locking screw 20 is aligned with the slit so that a tapered nose 76 of the locking screw will enter and expand the intramedullary nail into locking engagement with portions of the cross nail extending about the D shaped aperture 16 . The length of the locking screw is selected to engage the nose thereof with the inside surface of the intramedullary nail and lock the locking screw to the cross nail 14 . Holes 62, 64 are formed through lower portions 60 of the intramedullary nail to receive screws 66 that fix lower portions 60 of the intramedullary nail to lower portions of the femur.
