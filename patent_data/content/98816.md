# METHOD OF MANUFACTURING A FIXED AND A MOVABLE PART PROVIDED WITH OPTICAL FIBRES

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a fixed part and a movable part provided with mutually parallel optical fibres incorporated in a fibre optical relay. The fibres A1 A2, B1 B2, C1 C2 are fixed to a base plate 1 in V shaped grooves 2a 2c with the aid of glueing or bonding. The base plate and fibres are then parted by a cut X X at right angles to the axial direction of the fibres and to a planar edge surface of the base plate. There is thus obtained two mutually conforming parts forming the fixed part and the movable part in the fibre optical relay.
