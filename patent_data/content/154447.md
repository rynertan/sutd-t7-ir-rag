# Compositions and method for improving wound healing.

## Abstract
The healing of wounds is promoted by contacting the wound surfaces with a suspension of collagen and a glycosaminoglycan that is chemotactic for fibroblasts and or endothelial cells. Typical glycosaminoglycans that exhibit the desired chemotaxis are heparin, heparan sulfate, and alginate. Two or more glycosaminoglycans can be present in the suspensions. Collagen is present in the suspension in the order of 7 10 mg ml while the glycosaminoglycan is present in much lower concentrations, e.g. 250 350 Âµg ml. Applica tion of the collagen glycosaminoglycan suspension to open wounds greatly increases the rate of healing.
