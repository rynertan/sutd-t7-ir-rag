# Dry etching apparatus using reactive ions.

## Abstract
A dry etching apparatus using reactive ions is dis closed. A housing 13 in which a workpiece 18 is etched is provided with a cathode electrode 12 on which the work piece 18 is mounted, and a an anode electrode 11 ar ranged opposite the cathode electrode. An etching gas is supplied to the housing, and pressure inside of the housing is held at a certain level. High frequency voltage is applied between the cathode and the anode electrodes. A plurality of magnets 19 are arranged outside of the housing to gen erate magnetic fields B around the cathode electrode. The plurality of magnets are separated from one another, with a predetermined clearance being interposed therebetween, to form an endless track. The plurality of magnets are moved along the endless track, to thereby cause the mag netic fields B to be moved in one direction on the cathode electrode.
