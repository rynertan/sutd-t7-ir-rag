# Earth working machine.

## Abstract
A turntable 14 is rotatably mounted on a mobile chassis 10 . A carriage 20 is rotatably mounted on the turntable 14 in eccentric relation thereto, and an earth working mechanism 27 32 is mounted on the carriage 20 . First and second fluid motors 18 42 rotate the turntable and carriage, respectively. A fluid rate synchroniser 57 composed of third and fourth interconnected fluid motors 58, 59 discharges fluid under pressure at a predetermined ratio from a source of third to the first and second fluid motors 18, 42 . The turntable 14 and the carriage 20 can thus be angularly moved about their own axes at a constant angular displacement ratio.
