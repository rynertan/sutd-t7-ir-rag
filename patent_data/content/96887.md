# PLASTIC PIPES INTERNAL PRESSURE STRENGTH TESTING DEVICE

## Abstract
Plastic pipes internal pressure strength testing device comprising a heating system and a hydraulic system, where in the hydraulic system is a hydropneumatic system, which has as a basic part, a hydropneumatic converter, the piston with the smaller diameter of which is connected from one side with the tested sample placed in the heating chamber, via a non re turn valve, manometers, advantageously a test manometer and a contact manometer, valves and a heater, and from the other side with the water supply network via a second non return valve and an advantageously electromagnetic valve, whereas the piston of this converter with the larger diameter is connect ed via a second, advantageously electromagnetic valve, a compensation tank and a gas regulator with a gas supplying net, advantageously air supplying net.
