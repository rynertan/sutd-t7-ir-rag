# A process for the continuous partial crystallization and the separation of a liquid mixture and a device for carrying out this process.

## Abstract
Process for continuous crystallization of a liquid mixture in which the mixture is led through a cascade of cooling sections. The temperature in the first section is such that a part of the mixture crystallizes, the temperature in each succeeding section is lower than in the preceding section. The temperature in the last section is such that not the whole of the liquid mixture solidifies. The crystals kept suspended in the liquid are led through the cascade. In one section, not being the last one, the crystal and liquid flow is divided in two flows. One flow mainly formed by the crystals. the other by the liquid. A portion of the divided flow is recycled to the dividing section to keep the crystal volume fraction at a desired value.
