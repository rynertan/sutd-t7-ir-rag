# Making lightweight concrete.

## Abstract
Lightweight concrete incorporating expanded polys tyrene beads is made by first coating the expanded beads with an aqueous surfactant solution, which preferably con tains a substantive cationic surfactant, e.g. a substituted or ethoxylated quaternary ammonium compound containing a C₁₀ to C₁₈ alkyl substituent or an ethoxylated primary or secondary amine having a C₁₀ to C₁₈ alkyl substituent, and a non ionic surfactant such as an ethoxylated primary or secondary alcohol or a nonylphenol ethylene oxide conde nsate. The wet beads are coated with dry cement and then mixed with a further supply of cement, water and sand or aggregate to complete the concrete mix.
