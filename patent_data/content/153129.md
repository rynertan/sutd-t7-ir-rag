## Abstract
A water sprinkler comprises a body 15 housing a rotor 1 which is rotatably driven about a central vertical axis by water which enters the body by an inlet 12 . Water leaves the body 15 by a hollow distribution shaft 5 having at its upper end a water discharge nozzle 14 . The shaft 5 extends at an angle to the vertical and is rotationally driven about the central verti cal axis by an epicyclic drive mechanism comprising a pinion ro tatable with the rotor 1 , a ring gear 11 formed on the internal wall of the body 15 and a planet gear 7 . The planet gear meshes both with the pinion and the ring gear and is attached to one end of the hollow distribution shaft.
