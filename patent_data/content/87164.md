# Novel crystal modifications, processes for their production, and pharmaceutical preparations containing them.

## Abstract
Novel crystal modifications of catechin monohy drate and of catechin anhydrate more suitable for pharmaceutical preparations for reasons of higher stability against moisture and or light and distinguished from hither to known modifications by unique X ray diffraction spectra are produced by specific recrystallisation and or crystal rearrangement processes. Pharmaceutical preparations comprising the novel crystal forms.
