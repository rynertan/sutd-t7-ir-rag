# Complex of biologically active protein with reactive high polymer having bonded thereto bifunctional chelate.

## Abstract
In a protein polysuccinimide complex, a biologically active protein is combined with a polysuccinimide having a mean molecular weight of 2,000 to 1,000,000 and has, in certain amounts, units represented by the following for mulae The complex can be labelled with a radio metal and can be used as a radioactive diagnostic in the field of nuclear medicine.
