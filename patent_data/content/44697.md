# Fuel oil atomizer.

## Abstract
A fuel oil atomizer 10 comprises a burner tube 12 through which fuel oil is supplied under selected pressure and a coaxial surrounding steam tube 34 providing an annular space 48 therebetween, the flow of steam being under greater pressure than the oil pressure. A burner head 22 is joined to the burner oil tube 12 through an orifice 20 of selected diameter. The burner head 22 has a long axial bore 24 of constant selected diameter, which leads to the burner tip, which has a plurality of tip ports 30 . There are a number of transverse ports 44 between the annular steam path 48 and the central bore 24 , so that the steam can flow under pressure into the central bore 24 of the burner head 22 to mix thoroughly with the pressurized oil flowing from the orifice 20 . Two factors are important in the construction of the burner head 22 , namely that the central bore 24 must be of constant diameter from the point where the steam and oil mix, outwardly toward the burner tip ports 30 . Secondly, the total cross sectional area of the tip ports 30 must be less than the cross sectional area of the central bore 24 .
