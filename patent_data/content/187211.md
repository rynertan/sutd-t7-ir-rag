# Tone signal generating apparatus.

## Abstract
A tone signal generating apparatus comprises a wave form memory 14 in which a plurality of waveform data representing different waveforms but corresponding to a same tone name are stored. These different waveform data are sequentially read from the memory 14 and are supplied to a digital low pass filter 28 which comprises a delay circuit 33 and a multiplier 31 connected to each other to form a feedback loop. The low pass filter 28 smoothes abrupt variation of the waveform data and outputs a smoothed waveform data thereby interpolating the different waveforms. A tone signal is produced in accordance with this smoothed waveform data.
