# Low density thermally insulating composite.

## Abstract
A low density, thermally insulating composite which is ablation resistant and impervious to gases and liquids. The composite is comprised of a carbon carbon syntactic foam 12 material which is covered and penetrated by pyrolytic carbon 14 , in order to increase the strength of the foam material. Pyrolytic graphite 16 is then deposited onto at least one surface of the pyrolytic carbon 14 covered and penetrated foam material to improve the thermal insulation of the composite and render it impervious to gas or liquids.
