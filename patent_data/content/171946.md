# Specific binding method and composition.

## Abstract
A specific binding assay composition and its use for determining a ligand in a sample comprises a a binding partner for the ligand b a detection system which has at least two components c a selectively accessible vesicle having a surface incorporated ligand or ligand analog and a first component of the detection system therein d a substance which modifies vesicle accessibility in response to binding of surface incorporated ligand or ligand analog and the binding partner e at least one additional component of the detection system which is reactive with the first compo nent to produce a detectable response and f at least one surfactant which does not modify vesicle accessibility. The composition and method are suitable for use with auto mated, including continuous flow type, analyzers.
