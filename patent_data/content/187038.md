# TORQUE MOTOR WITH HIGH TORQUE POLES AND MAGNETIC CENTERING SPRING ADJUSTMENT

## Abstract
A two pole limited angle torque motor 1 including a rotor assembly 2 having one or more permanent rotor magnets 5 and a stator assembly 6 including a stator coil 9 and a pair of circumferentially spaced stator pole structures 10, 11 . Each pole structure 10, 11 includes a generally axially extend ing stator pole blade 14 about which the stator coil 9 circum ferentially extends. A radially outwardly extending flange 15 is at one end of one of the stator pole structures 10 and at the opposite end of the other stator pole structure 11 . The stator pole blades 14 have a greater radial thickness 20 adjacent the flanges thereof than at the opposite end of the blade to re duce the magnetic flux density of the stator pole structures in the region of the blades adjacent the flanges thereof. Also, the axial outer end faces 21 of the flanges 15 desirably protrude axially outwardly adjacent the radial inner ends thereof to make use of the fringing fields of the rotor magnet at the ends of the rotor assembly to increase the reluctance torque of the motor. At the ends of the stator assembly 9 opposite the stator pole flanges 15 on opposite sides of the rotor assembly 2 are ad ditional stator pole pieces 24 . The blades 14 of the stator pole structures 10, 11 terminate short of the other ends of the rotor magnet 15 to provide room for the additional stator pole pieces 24 at such other ends for a given rotor length whereby the motor has a substantially higher reluctance torque without significantly reducing the torque due to interaction of magnetic fields. Surrounding the stator assembly in an outer magnetic housing 16 comprising two semi cylindrical parts 30, 31 with air gaps 17, 18 between opposite sides thereof, said housing parts being rotatable relative to each other to change the size of one gap relative to the other or otherwise machin able to change both gaps equally for adjusting the reluctance torque of the motor.
