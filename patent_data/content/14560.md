# Apparatus and method for folding the end closures for cartons.

## Abstract
Apparatus for automatically folding the end closure of a carton of rectangular cross section which includes a cover panel 19 hinged to a rear sidewall of the carton and a pair of flanking gusset panels 21, 23 which are each respectively hinged to one edge of the cover panel 19 and to an adjacent sidewall 15, 17 . The carton is continuously moved along a conveyor path 31 with one 21 of the gussel panels leading and the other 22 trailing. A folding head 77 moves along a parallel conveyor path and translates to a location adjacent the carton. An abutment 67 adjacent the conveyor path contracts the leading gusset panel 21 and folds it inward along a line 21a at about a 45 angle to its hinged edges. An arm 99 mounted on the folding head 77 is caused to swing relative to the conveyor to fold the trailing gusset panel 23 inward along a line at about 45 angle to its hinged edges.
