# Method, apparatus and process for generating television signals for viewing and reproduction of three dimensional holografic visual scenes.

## Abstract
Apparatus and process for generating television signals of a visual scene for viewing in three dimensions and holografic reproduction, comprises one or more conventional TV cameras, including one or more seperate color video camera tubes, each camera tube adapted to recieve light of one of the three primary colours. The camera tubes and lenses are aligned with one or more optical axes which are normally parallel and are spaced apart a selected distance in a horizontal plane. At least one plane may be rotated so that it can be turned through a small angle in such a direction as to intersect the other axes at a selected distance in front of the camera. Synchronizing beams are provided for two subrasters in scanning of the camera tubes. During alternate scanning of the subrasters, injected control frequencies above horizontal line speed selectively mute or switch primary color signals creating vertical light sensitive color zones, which are vertically aligned at the beginning of each line scan by the camera horizontal sync pulse. A special square lens adapter to be described in detail later intensifies the dimensional holografic effect. A special laser lighting system synchronized with the vertical and horizontal camera scanning sync will further process and intensify the three dimensional holografic visual scene, which is further processed for reproduction from tape to tape transfer, tape to film transfer, or transmitted in a normal fashion to conventional video carrier systems such as cable or satellite transmission. When the processed video signals are received and displayed on a conventional TV receiver the visual scene will be seen in three dimensional and holografic viewing.

## Description
METHOD, APPARATUS AND PROCESS FOR GENERATING TELEVISION SIGNALS FOR VIEWING AND REPRODUCTION OF THREE DIMENSIONAL HOLOGRAFIC VISUAL SCENESThis invention lies in the field of television signal generation and processing. More particularly it concerns a system for generating and processing TV signals from a visual scene, in which a three dimensional effect can be observed in the displayed TV signals, by properly orienting the optical axes of the three camera tubes, and by alternately muting the signals from a first and third tube which are adapted to pass the first and third primary colors.This disclosure is a continuation in part from our previously filed application, application number 80400243.4 European Patent Office filed 20 Febrauary 1980, namely, METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR GENERATINGAND PROCESSING. TELEVI SI ON SIGNALS FOR VIEWING IN THREEDIMENSIONS AND MOVING HOLOGRAMS.In the moving picture industry, displays of moving pictures have been prepared and displayed for observation with a three dimensional effect. This has been accomplished by using two separate camera,with optical axes spaced apart and nominally p.lzallelX but converging at a selected small angle. The light reaching each camera is filtered with one or the other of two primary colors. The corresponding pictures are displayed sequentially, while one glass passes the first primary color and the second glass passes the second primary colors and requires the viewer to use special glasses. In the field of television the applicants are unaware of any prior art which allows reproduction of a threedimensional holografic visual scene useing conventional broadcasting aid recieving systems. Other systems have been shown to display a dimensional image but only after altering the NTSC standard as required by the NAD andEuropean broadcast standards. Other systems either require changing the basic structure of the television reciever or changing the required band width for broadcasting, or require the use of special coded glasses for Yiewing a dimensional image.The present invention relates to apparatus and process for generating television signals for viewing and reproduction of three dimensional holografic visual scenes without te use of special coded glasses, and the three dimensional holografic effect is accomplished within the framwork of the NAB and European television broadcast standards, without changing the basie structure of the standard television reciever, comprises one or more conventional TV cameras, including one or more s e ete color video camera tubes, each camera tube adapted to recieve light of one of the three primary colors. The camera tubes and lenses are aligned with one or more optical axes which are normally parallel and are spaced apart a selected distance in a horizontal plane.At least one plane may be rotated so that it can be turned through a small angle in such a direction as to intersect the other axes at a selected distance in front of the camera. Sy ichronizing beams are provided for two subrasters in scanning of the camera tubes. During alternate scanning of the subrasters, injected control frequencies above horizontal line speed selectively mute or switch primary color signals creating vertical light sensitive color zones, which are vertically aligned at the beginning of each line scan by the camera horizontal sync pulse. A special square lens adapter to be described in detail later, intensifies the dimensional holografic effect.A special laser lighting system synchronized with the vertical and horizontal camera scanning sync will further process and intensify the three dimensional holografic visual scene, which is further processed for reproduction from tape to tape transfer, tape to film transfer, or transmitted in a normal fashion to conventional video carrier systems such as cable or satellite transmission.When the processed video signals are recieved and displayed on a conventional TV reciever the visual scene will be seen in three dimensional and holografic viewing. It has been discovered by the applicants by experimentation that the human eyes percieve depth of field and stero grafic information to the brain by the use of horizontal scanning of the optic nerves connected to the rods and cones of each eye through individual nerve bundles. That is the brain by use of it s optic nerve ending to the rods and cones of each eye scans oneeye in a clockwise horizontal fashion while simultainously scanning the opposite eye in a counter clockwise horizontal fashion from the other side of the brain via way of it s respective nerve bundles. This phoenomen can be observed by alternately holding a red filter in front of one eye and then the opposite eye, while viewing TV tuned to display noise or snow displayed on the TV screen.It can be observed that while the red filter is held between the first eye and the TV screen the raster or snow displayed will appear to rotate in a horizontal clockwise fashion, while if the filter is changed to the opposite eye the TV display will rotate horizontally in a counter clockwise direction.In order to electronicly re produce three dimensional holografic and stero grafic viewing of a visual scene without the aid of coded glasses or modification of the television reciever or film screen, the video sibnals of a TV camera must be converted to allow R,B,G, color rotation , or phasing, of injected control frequiencies that scan clockwise for a time frame, and counterclockwise during the second time frame or scan, thereby matching the physiological make up of the brain s scanning as it horizontally scans the rods and cones of the human eyes, in a clockwise fashion for one eye and counter clockwise for the opposite eye.The ability to polorize the 1st eye to one scan or time frame sub raster of a TV display and simultanously polorize the opposite or second eye to the second scan sub raster or time frame of a TV display is accomplished in the following way. 1 By injecting control frequiencies above line speed at apx. one Mgz. vertically aligned color zones are encoded to a TV reciever which simulates the brain s ability to horizontally scan rods and cones of the human eye. 2 By phasing the RBG color rotation during switching of injected control frequiencies vertically aligned color zones are RBG rotated or polorized during the 1st scan to correspond to the clockwise scanning of the 1st eye from red to blue, during the time frame or scan of the second sub raster the control frequiencies are BRG rotated, or phased, in a counter clockwise direction from blue to red, which corresponds to the brain s ability to simultaneously distinguish primary colors while scanning the optic nerves of each eye horizontally in opposite directions. the ability of the brain to not only horizontally scan the optic nerves, but to simultaneously distingush primary colors in a phased manner, that is one eye perdeves color encoding from a RBG rotation or phase while the opposite eye percieves or registers color rotation from BRG phasing. allows us to electronicly color encode a television camera. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIMARY EMBODIMENTIn the conventional television camera there are three video camera tubes, each one adapted to pass and process one of the three primary colors, such as, forexample, red, green and blue. In BIG1, the first camera tube C1, number 42A processes the red light, camera tube C2, number 42B processes the green light and the third camera tube C3, 42C processes the blue light.The linesl8A, 18B and 18C represent the three optical axes.. They are nominally parallel, and spaced apart a selected distance. When precisely parallel to each ot other, they will not transmit a three dimensional signal. It is only when one or both of the outer optical axes Al and or A3 is rotated, so that it intersects the the center optical axes A2 at some selected distance in front of the camera, that the appearance of a threedimensional picture will be evident. The details of rotating the optical axes will be discussed later.In FIG. 1 two camera lenses are shownLl, numeral 20A and L3, numeral 20C,repectively in the optical axes Al and A3. The dash lines 22 and 24 represent control means, which tie together the twG lenses L1 and L3, so that as one is rotated the other one will be rotatedand the focus of each of them will track together and the zoom effect will also track. The precise directions of the three axes are important only in the region of the lenses L1 and L3. After that the optical axis moves into the camera but the pr precise position of the video camera tubes can be altered by the use of mirrors, etc.However, for convenience, and other reasons and without limitation the three video camera tubes Cl, e2, and C3 will be described as co axial of the lenses L1 and L3. As the axis Al is rotated the lens and the camera tube will be rptated together, as will be described in connection with FIG. 5. However, by the same means as in FIG. 5, the camera tube can remain stationary while the axis rotates.Consider the optical axis 18A. Light from a distant scene, off to the right, arrives at the lense L1 and p passes through the lens to be intercepted by partially silvered mirror 28A which passes part of the light through filter F1, numeral 38A and axis 40A to the camera camera tube 42A. The filter F1 will, for example, be such as to pass only the first primary color, red.. The output signal of the camera 42A passes by leads 43A to the first video am lifier 44A for processing.Part of the light deflec tetl l y mirror 28A passes as beam 30A to partially reflecting mirror 32A. This light is diverted through beam 36, filter F2, numeral 383 and beam 40B,to the second video camera tube 42B.Here the filter F2 is selected to pass the second of the primary colors such as green, for example.Along optical axes 18C light from the scene arrives to the lens 20C and passes through the lens as beam 26C to a partially reflecting mirror 28C that passes part of the light to the filter F3 numeral 38C, beam 40C to the third video camera tube 420. The filter F3 is designed to pass the third of the primary colors, namely blue, for example. The output of the video camera C3 goes by leads 43C to the video amplifier B3 for processing.The mirror 28C in the optical axis 18C transmits part of the incoming light from lens L3 as beam 30C to a se second partially reflecting mirror 32C which directs the light by beam 34 through the mirror 32A as beam 36 to the filter F2 and to the second video camera tube42B. In other words, lens L1 passes red light to the first camera tube 42A, and part of the green light to the third video tubes C3 and some additional green light to the second video camera tube 42B..A camera control58 is provided as is customary in the video camera, and no detail of this control is required since the conventinal control can be used.This camera control 58 provides a synchronizing buss 48 which provides signals to the video amplifiers and to the camera tuPes to control the synchronization of the raster sweeps in all of the camera tubes and amplifier.The camera control means 58 will provide two subscans interlaced, as in the conventional V system. The sync buss 48 is connected also to a flip flop 50 which responsive to the synchronizing signal 48 is set to provide a Q output on 52C, during one sub raster and a output on 52A during the second raster. The video tube Vl passes its output on lead 46A to an analog switch 54A and the output of the switch goes by lead 56At3 the camera control. When there is positive signal on lead 52A, he analog switch will pass signals on le 46A through 56A to the camera control 58 in exactly the same way that the signal goes from video amplifier V2 through lead 46B to the camera control.On the other hand, when there is no signal on lead 52A, the switch 54A will block the transmissin of signal from 46A to the camera controlSimilarly when there is positive signal on lead 52C, the signal from the video amplifier 44C will go by lead 46C to the analog switch 54C, through lead 5EC to the camera control, just as in the case of the video amplifier 443. However, when a logical zero appears on the lead 520, the switch 54C is opened or disabled, and there is no ble signal output from the video amplifier 44C to the camera control. It is therefore clear that the flip flop and the analog switches act as a synchronized switch, and other kinds of switches could be used, so that on the first raster the red signal and green signal are passed but no blue signal and on the second raster the green signal and blue signal are passed but no red signal.. Ths three video signals on leads 56A, 46B and 56C are then processed in the camera control to provide the transmitted signal 60 to the transmitter, and eventually to a television receiver.. To the normal eye the picture on the television receiver will look like any conventional picture in three colors and will be two dimensional. However, if as shown in FIGURE 7 a pair of eye glasses 97 are provided, in which one lens 98A is red passing glass, and the lens 98C in the other part of the eye glass 97 is blue passing glass, then the right and left eye will ultimately see the blue picture and the red picture which are not precisely aimed at the same scene and therefore will show a three dimenr sional optical effect. The lens and camera portions of the system of FiGURES 2, 3 and 4, which show respectively the use of two lenses 20A and 20C. In FIGURE 2 rhw axis 18A is shown tilted inwardly in accordance with the dash line 18A. The de description of FIGURE 2 is substantially identical to the portion of FIGURE 1 and will not be repeated.In FIGURE 3 the lens and video camera tube and filter portions of the system of FIGURE 1 are reproduced, except that in FIGURE 3 there are now three lenses L1, L2 and L3, respectively numbered 20A, 20B and 20C, which define the three optical axes 18A, 183 and 18C. The three lenses L1, L2 and L3 are tied together by controls 22 and 24 as in the case ofFIGURE 1, so that they will track each other on focus and zoom. No internal mirrors are needed and each lens supplies the light for one of the video camerasC1, C2 and C3. The filters F1, F2 and F3 are identical to those in FIGURE 1, and the action is substantially as described for FIGURE 1.In FIGURE 3 the rotation of the two outer axes 18A and 18C to the position of the dash lines 18A and 18C indicates that the two outer axes rotated inwardly at an angle such as to intersect the center optical axis 18B at a selected distance in front of the camera. These could becontrolled manually, as automatically or mechanically in response to the focus control 22. This automatic con tbol is shown by the dashed lines 22A. 22B from the we control 22 to the optical axes, 18A and 18C .FIGURE 4 is another embodiment of the lens and camera tube section indicated generally by numeral 103. Here a single lens L2 is utilized and all of th lightgoing to the three video tubes 42A,42B and 42C are supplied by the single lens B2, by mean of semitransparent mirrors, as is done in the conventional video camera.Thus the beam 66B is broken up into two parts 66B which supplies the beam 70C through filterF3 to the third camera 03. Another part of the light in beam 66B goes as beam 68B to a second partially reflecting mirrow which diverts part of the light as beam 68B to another completely reflecting mirror and to the filter F1 and to the first video tube Cl. Here again the filter F1 passes red light to the video camera tube. The remaining part of the beam 66B goes as beam 70 B to filter F2 which passes green light to the secondvideo camera tube 423. The main improvement in this embodiment is out in advance of the lens where there are three spaced apart filters and spaced apart substantially parallel optical axes 18A, 18B and 18C. The filterFll passes red light similarly to FIGURE F1 to the lens. Filter F12 passes green light and is a substantially identical to filter F2. Filter F13 passes blue lights similar to that that of filter F3..Thus filter Fll is in the optical axis Al which passes light of the first primary color through a fully reflecting mirror 64A through a partially reflecting mirror 64B to the lens L2. Simialary the third optical axis 18C passing through the filter F13 passes a blue light as beam 66C to fully reflecting mirror 62C, to partially reflecting mirror 62B, and on through to the lens L2 and to the green second camera C2.The green light is defined by axis 183 and pa ses through filterF12 and two partially reflecting mirrors 62B and 64B through the lens L2 and through two additional partially reflectingmirrors, to the filterF2 and to the second video camera tube, It will be clear that a simple lens co axil with each of the axes 18A, 183 and 18C preferable in advance of the filters F11, F12, F13 may serve to better define the three optical axes.Again, if the axes 18A, 18B, and 18C are precisely parallel, therewill be no three dimensional optical effect however, if the axis 18A is rotated inwardly as shown by the dash line 18A there will be some contribution to three dimensionality of the display.One of the problems of rotation of the optical axis in conjunction with the use of mirrors is important, since the light passes through filter Fll must be pr cisely focused and positioned with the other two light components, even though the axis 18A is rotated. To do this the axis 18A is rotated at the center of the mirror 64A as shown. Referring now to FIG. 5 which is designed around the schematic diagram of BIG. 2 and FIG. 4, the nominal direction of the optical axis 18A is shown, and the rotated axis 18A is shown. The center of rotation is at the center of the mirror 28A. In the drawing the element 76 is a stationary circular concave rack, and 78 is a circular convex rack, which is attached to, and moves with the axis 18A as shown by the dashed line 78A. Numeral 80 represents a small pinion positioned between the two racks 76 and 78. As the rack 78 moves through a selected angle say 10 degrees, the pinion 80 will move only half that distance. Thus as the axis 18A rotates to 18A the plane 82 of the mirror 28A will rotate to 82 through an angle 21 just one half of that of the angle 23 of axis 18A . Thus angle 21 is one half of angle 23.As the axis 18A is rotated, and drives the rack 78the mirror 28A will follow in proper angle, so that the entering light through the lens 20A will be precisely in the same beam 30A, even though the axis does change.Thus the picture passed through the beam 30A to the second camera tube will not move even though the optical axis changes.As shown in FIG. 1 green light is supplied to the camera C2 from lenses L1 and3. While the pictures will be stationary in view of the rotation of the axes 18A and 18C, the pictures that are represented will be slightly different and therefore there may be some minor blurring in the yellow picture in which case one of the other mirrors 28A or 28C can be removed so that the green light is supplied only by one lensL1 or L3. In order to utilize the improved camera system ofFIGS. i,2,3 and 4, all that is needed to view the reproduced pictures in the receiver is the eye glass 97 shown and described in FIG. 7. If the glasses of FIG. 7 are not used, then the picture produced by the television signals from FIG. 1 will look like any conventional television signal and will be only two dimensional. However in a second embodiement to be shown later in this disclosure glasses will not be needed.Referring now to FIG.6 there is shown an embodiment in which the television receiver is modified to provide a pseudo three dimensional viewing. There will only be a two dimensional picture as is conventional. However, what has been done is to take a synchronizing signal either from the TV circuit on lead 90, or from the local power sustem, 60 cycle power 92, which drives, through lead 92A, a flip flop 93. This flip flop through theQ and 4 outputs, control two analog switches, 88A and 880. These switches sequentially control and mute the red signal, and then the Wde signal one in one sub raster, and the other in the other sub raster. Thus the video amplifier outputs, on lead 89A, the red signal, which goes through the switch 88A to the coupling unit 87, to control the red gun. Similarly, the blue signal from the blue video amplifier and lead 89C goes through the switch 88C to control the blue gun. But the Q and 4 signals alternately mute the red and the blue by putting a high signal, or logical one, on the lead 94A to enable the red signal, or on 34C to enable the blue signal.If desired 89C or in lead. 89A an analog phase shift or delay register 96 can be inserted in the lead so that the display of the blue signal or the red signal will be delayed or phase shifted from the display of the other signal, and will give the impression of three dimensionality. What has been described is an improvement in video camera and processing apparatus for generating television signals from a visual scene, such that these signals when reprocuced in a receiver and viewed with colored glasses will give the impression of three dimensionality, to the picture displayed on a two dimensional surface. To be described later in this. disclosure a further improvement will show a process and apparatus for generating television signals when reproduced in a receiver and viewed will give the impression of three dimensionality without the aid of colored glasses, to the picture displayed on a two dimensional surface. In i IG. 8 is shown a quadrature wave form that electronicly color encodes the TV camera allowing the television receiver to display information in a way that corresponds to the human brain s counterclockwise and clockwise scanning of the rods and cones of the human eyes. By selectively muting the red and blue color signals of the television camera during alternate scans of time frames sub rasters atfrequiencies above line speed of the television camera vertically aligned color zones are alternately quadraturely phased.If muting of the red TV pick up tube is represented by wave form 1 and muting of the blue TV pick up tube of the television camera is represented by wave form 2 and the green tube is left un muted as represented by by line 3 then in forword motion as time periods advance, 4 on the combined waveform 0,1,2,3,0 etc., the counter clockwise scanning motion represented by color wheel chart 10 is realized. However as the time periods represented on line 4 are made to count backwards, i.e. 0,3,2,1,0 etc., then a clockwise motion is observed as indicated by color wheel chart 9 . The resulting display or scan on a TV receiver 5 is a series of vertically aligned color sensitive bar zones selectively alternating to yellow, white, cyan, green, yellow, white cyan, green etc., which selectively phases the color zones for the 1st scan 7 or time frame in a counter clockwise rotation 10 . Line 8 represents the reverse phasing, yellow, green,cyan, white etc., or clockwise color scan rotation 9 , which takes place during the alternate or second scan 8 or time frame sub raster . The method and apparatus for processing threedimensional holografic visual scenes for viewing on a television receiver has three main requimments 1 a specially designed square lens adapter, to be described in detail later, 2 polorized vertically aligned color zones for display of 3 selective quadrature muting above line speedhigh speed of the red and blue color signals of a television camera, counter clockwise for the first scan sub raster and clockwise for the second scan sub raster .That is during the 1st sub raster the primary colors as passed through the video amplifiers of a television camera are selectively muted at high speed above line speed in a counter clockwise rotation of the color wheel leo from yellow to white, to cyan, to green, and alternately during the second scan or sub raster the color signals are muted in an inverse rotation clockwise 9 from yellow, to green to cyan, to white, to yellow etc.. What has been described is a method and apparatus for processing and reproduction of a visual scene in three dimensional and holografic stero grafic viewing when displayed on a conventional television receiver. FIG. 9 TRI PULSE PHASER WAVEFORM CHARTFig. 9 represents an alternate hex waveform for color encoding the vertical aligned color zones with two of the primary colors switching and one of the primary colors locked on solid. This gives a streched out version of the quadrature switching shown in FIG. 8.However, as shown in waveforms R 1 and3 2 this gives a combination of sixty degrees andEMI17.1 degree phasing instead of the continous ninty degree phasing shown inFIG. 8 1 with wave forms R, 1 and B, 2 , in combination with a third primary color G 3 blocked on thus a smoother color phasing control is achieved.This results in forward counting a clockwise 8 phasing of colors on a complete sub raster scan of TV tube 7 of yellow, white, white, cyan, green, green, 5 and a reverse count of the second scan sub raster clock wise 8 color phasing, of green, green, white, white, yellow 6 counting backwards from O . By resetting the JAM outputs of switch 13 of FIG. 11 the scan will start on a different number or position of waveformR 1 and B 2 producing a different color balance phasing,to correspond to different lighting conditions avialable to the camara. THE DUAL PULSE PHASERFIG. 10 is a dual pulse phaser circuit which is phase pre settable and capable of pulsing the quadrature 90 degree phased waveform of FIG. 8 forward or backward for a selected time period which is alsopresettable both for the forward and reverse wave form rotation. This circuit will be utilized in subsequent diagrams or figures of various embodiments of the invention here in described. This switching circuit is synchronized to the TV camera from the camera sync generatoroutputs, horizontal sync 1 , the 3 58 MHZ 2 , and vertical drive 3 . The outputs of this module or circuit board Pal 31 and P2 32 will drive the transmission gates of the muting circuits of the camera circuits to be explained in later embodiments. The 3.58 MEIZ sync 2 from the camera control unit CcU comes to the module in the form of a sine wave 5 .This sine wave is converted to a positive pulse 11 by a dual 741 half wave rectifier circuit 8 which makes the signal capable or acceptable for the CMOS digital circuitry. These clock pulses inter the clock input of a presettable up down 0 16 counter 16 . This counter 16 is presettable by four binary on and off switches. 13 which put a positive V48 voltage to the JAM inputs of the counter 16 . This determines where the counter 16 will start counting, thereby determining the begning phase of the dualpulse generator. The negative horizontal sync pulse 1 coming from the camera control unit to be described later is inverted by 741 inverter 7 to positive reset pulses 11 which enter the up down counter 16 via line 14 to the preset enable input of the counter 16 . This starts the counter at the predetermined number set by BCD jam input switches 13 . The presence of a positive 1 or 0 voltage on line 19 input to the V D input of counter 16 will determine wheter counter 16 will count up in a forward manner or backwards in a down or declinning order. The positive one or zero state , control line 19 will depend on the previous processing of the vertical drive 3 sync input from the camera control unit of the TV camera. These negative synce pulses are invertes by the 741 chip inverter 3 , known circruity, to positive compatible pulses 10 . Switch 41 in the position shown at 42 and 41 will route these vertical sync pulses via line 43 to flip flop 18 , bypassing thePAL and film process Sync circuits to be described later.The output of flip flop 18 controls or determines whether counter 16 counts up or down. If is a positive one than counter 16 will count up or forward.If 4 of flip flop 18 is negative ground potential is zero then counter 16 will count down or inreverse order from it s presettable position 13 , or phase over and over again untill reversed by flip flop 18 .Conversely, counter 16 will count up or forward from it s preset enable JAM input 13 3DC count.. The counter 16 will continue to count 0 16, over and over again, untill it is reversed.The output of this counter is fed via ABCD bus lines 17 to the ABCD binary numbers input of the BDC 4 line to 16 line decoder 20 .This decoder converts the digital BDC binary count to a deimal 1 to 16 output where the counts of 0,4,8, and 12 are connected via lines 21 , 22 to or gate 25 and lines 23 and 24 to or gate 26 . At this point a on lines 27 , and 28 uadrature count is generated.However flip flops 29 and 30 are needed to produce the square wave ninty degree quadrature phased out put of P1 31 and P2, 32 , which serve as control pulses for the analog switcher or transmission gates of the primary color pulsed outputs of the subsequent camera embodiments.Counter 58 , decoder 39 , presettable switching matrix 47 and2 or t gate 45 as preset in FIG. 10 will cause the up down counter 6 to forward counttWo subrasters and reverse count three subrasters, long enough for a complete 1 60th of a second scan on the V tube. This will enable the camera to do a 2, 3, sweep subraster sequence necessary for an un scrambled three dimensional holografic NITS0 tape to film transfer.By switching the preset switch from ground potential 49 to decoder 39 output 4 , a 2, 2, 1 sequence suitable for PAL tape to film three dimensional holografic transfer is possible. The Q output of flipflop 18 serves as a. sync output for the five bladed film chain projector. What has been described is a quadrature pulse module designed to produce the pulse train required to generate the wave form outputs and color phasing of electronic video signals as shown inFIG. 8 which is essential to the process and method of three dimensional holografy reproduction of a visual scene for viewing on television. FIG.11 TRI PULSE PHASERIn FIG. 11 the tri pulse phaser circuit is described.It is simular to the dual pulse phaser of FIG 10, with the additional capacity of pulsing all three of the primary color video signals. However, inthe described embodements it may be used to pulse only the first andsecond primary color signals by not connecting P3 37 and may be interchanged with the dual pulse phaser of FIG. 10. This tri pulse phaser of FIG.11 also has the additional advantage of it s own variable plus or minus one FEZ on board clock 5 which is synchronized by reset line 14A to insure straight vertical lines of the resultant color sensitive zones described in FIG. 8 asd FIG. 9. The tri pulse phaser also has a simplified film camera sync system comprising, of 0 4 counter 37 , or gate 40 , and flip flop 45 .Switch 38 as shown connected to counter 37 routes vertical drive pulse 12 to the 0 4 counter 37 where the BDC outputs A one 41 and C four 43 are connected to or gate 40 to generate an output pulse on the counts of 1,3and 4, for a unified sync transfer which will work on both PAL and NTSC systems for dimensional holografic film transfer systems. It accomplishes this by sending a change of 1 orO pulse to up down counter 16 in a 2, 2, 1 sequence. Whathas been described is a tri pulse module designed to produce the pulse train required to generate the waveform outputs and color phasing of electronic video signals as shown in FIG. 9 which is essential to the process and method of three dimensionl holografy reproduction of a visual scene for viewing on television. FIG. 12 HOLOGRAFIC LENSThe holografic lens is a three dimensional cube or rectangle comprising a solid cube,shaped dimensionally square or rectangular, ground from a solid glass or plastic material, or optionally ground from two or more glass or plastic sheets of a uniform thickness änd density or ground from alternately layered high and low density plastic and or glass sheets and optionally tinted for color encoding. One or more layers or planes may be partially silvered and or dichroicly tinted as may be required for varying lighting situations or desired effects, such as laser lighting vs. nominal lighting. The lens is normally placed in front of a conventional camera lens, but could also be placed behind a conventional lens or in a secondary light path position, and may be used either for electronic or film cameras. Also shown in FIG. 12 a is a means for mounting the lens in front of a conventionalTV camera lens and lens hood comprising a hood, or lens shield into which the lens is fitted, and two side brackets and extending rearward secured to the conventional lens hood by two thumb screws and . DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTReferring now to the drawings, and in particular to i8IG. 13 there is shown one embodiment of this invention which utilizes the dual pulse phaser 9 described inFIG. 10 and optionally fitted withholograìclens 41 as shown and described in FIG. 12.Imagry light enters the square lens 41 where it is dimensionally treated as described in FIG. 12, transverses through normal zoom lens 40 and enters the diachroic mirror and or filter system via light beam 42 where it is split into three primary colors by partially silvered glasses 30R and 42B where the red, green and blue primary colors are split off to the red 26R blue 36B and green 33G color filters to the three primary scanning video pick up tubes T1,T2and T3 , which are synchronized by camera sync bus 43 .Via l9lQT1 feeds its red video signal voltage to the red video amp l8R . Via 20G g2 feeds its green video voltage to green video amp 17G . Simultaneously, video pick up tube T3 passes its blue video voltage to the blue video amp 16B . The green video amp feed it s amplified video voltage to the camera control unit,CCU, unaltered. However the Red voltage feed 14R is interrupted or muted by transmission gate or analog switch 13 which is pulsed via lead 1OR rom the P2 output pulse train of dual pulse phaser 9 which circuitry is described in FIG. 10.Conversely, the blue video amp l6B feeds it s amplified variable video voltage via line 14B to transmission gate or analog switch 13B where it also is alternately muted off and on ty control pulse of the dual pulse phaser 9 p1 via line 113 . Dual pulse phaser 9 is Enchronized to the scanning tubesCTl T2 T3 of the camera by the 15,734 hz horizontal sync pulse output of the CCU 1 via line 6 , and the 60hz vertical drive sync output of the CCU 1 via line 8 . The dual pulse phaser 9 is clocked by the 3,58 MHZ output of CCU 1 via line 7 . The processed three dimensional holografic signal is outputed from the camera control unit CCU 1 via line 2 where a three diminsional holografic image may be viewed on a standard television receiver.The video signal via line 2 may be recorded on a standard video tape recorde,switched in a normal fashion by a TV switcher, transmitted on conventional carrier systems such as cable or sattelite transmission, transmitted or recorded on video disc for reproduction of a visa scene in three dimensional holografic and stero grafic viewing on a standard television receiver, without the aid of special viewing glasses as shown in our preliminary embodiment FIG. . What has been described is a special lens system as shown in FIG. 12 and FIG. 22 coupled with electronic circuitry that switches or mutes the video color signals of a conventional television camera to produce phased light sensitive vertically aligned color barr zones on a television receiver corresponding to the human brain s horizontally phased scanning of the human eyds rods and cones, to produce the electront waveform outputs and color phasing as shown in FIG. 8 which are essential to the process and method of threedimensional, holografic reproduction of a visual scene for viewing on television. Referring now to the drawings, and in particular to FIG. 14 there is shown one embodiment of this invention which utilizes the TRI PULSE PHASER 20 described in FIG. 11 , and fitted with a dual lens system as described in FIG. 22.The FIG. 14 drawing represents a dual lens axis embodiment electronicly simular to FIG.13 except that the pulse phaser 20 described by FIG.11 and shows anoptional TG analog switch 12 which may be connected to P3 of tri pulse phaser 20 via line 22 .For a three phase continuous 60 degree three pulse waveform chain from P1 iP2 and P3 to control TG analog switches 11 via line 21 , 12 via line 22 , and 13 via line 23 to switch, or continuously mute primary colors, red, blue, and green before entering the camera control unit at REG inputs via lines 14 , 15 , and 16 . Light imagry of the optical axis x enters through square holografic lens SL1 as described inFIG. 12, continues through conventional zoom lens L1 , andis filtered by blue color filter 25B , and is scanned by pick up tube T1 25 .Light imagry of the optica2cis y enters through square holografic lens SL2 6 as described by FIG.12 and continues through the normal zoom lens L2 , and is filtered by diachroic color filter system 26 with green imagry enteringTV camera scanning pick up tube T2 30 via beam 27 and red imagery entering TV camera scanning pick up tube T3 29 via light beam 28 . The optical axis may be rotated inwardly to intercept at any desired distance as prescribed by the depth of field of the particular initial pre focus of lenses. L1 and L2 which are mechanically linked by focus drive chain 3A and zoom drive chain 33 .The angle ofinterception of Irciand,yi is a function of zoo R or drive chain 3A which drives the dual ratio sprocketed worm gear 3D against pinioned lever 3C to move the x axis, inwardly or outwardly as shown in FIG. 22. Drive chain 3B ties slip rings 3 and 5 together which allows initial pre focus however from then onties focus to a variable ratio of zoom.The tri pulsed phaser 20 is synched to tht camera control unit CCU 1 via line 19 to vertical sync. The pulse phaser 20 has it s own in board variable one iHZ clock which may be adjusted for optimum color phasing of the widthof the color sensitive bar zones.To adhieve the conbination the continuouS 6GO 1200 color phasing waveform represented by FIG. 9,TG analog switch 12 must be removed from the circuit a allowing the green video amplfier 31 to go un muted to the CCU I via line 15. Thus waveform switching and light sensitive bar zones as represented by charts onFIG. 9 are electronically produced giving the threedimensional stereo grafic holografically encoded video signal output on line 35 as the final output of camera control unit 1 , which viewed on a conventinnal television receiver or monitor reproduces a visual scene in three dimensions and stero grafic holografic image. What has been described is a special lens system as described in FIG. 12 and FIG.22 coupled with electronic circuitry as described in FIG,10 that switches or mutes the video color signals of a conventional television camera to produce phased light sensitive vertically aligned color barr zones on a television receiver corresponding to the human brain s horizontally phased scanning of the human eyes rods and cones, to produce the electronic waveforms outputs and color phasing as shown in FPG.10 which are essential to the process and method of three dimensional stero grafic and holografic reproduction of a visual scene for viewing on television. TWIi1 CAMERA EiJBODIMEl4T FIG.15 is an embodiment showing a method and apparatus for processing video signal for television for the reproduction of a visual scene in three dimensional, holografic and stero grafic viewing on a conventional television receiver comprising two television cameras combined as one system using twin holografic lens as described in FIG. 12 and focus mechanism described in FIG. 22 and uses two tri pulsephasers 4A and 4B as shown in FIG 11, and a tri two channel TG analog multiplexer 2 tod alternately multiplex the twin cameras via line 38,39 and LO to a single camera control unit 1 .

This will produce the 6O 12C waveform color phase switching shown and described thereto in FIG.9, to be used for normal studio lighting conditions. Video out via line 23 froia the CCU 1 to either switcher transmitter studio monizo , satellite or cable carrier, or reproduced on video tape, records, or disc, so that a visual scene may be reproduced stereograficly for holografic and threedimensonal viewing. FIG.16 is an embodiment describing a method and apparatus for processing and reproduction of three dimensional holografic and stereografic transfers from two dimensional film to threedimensional holografic stereografic video tape and two dimemsional film to three dimensional holografic and stereografic film, which can be transfered simultaneously, comprising a five bladed synchronous film projector 1 which is focused on the back 2 of rear projection screen 3 and is powered by sync converter power unit 19 which also powers .the sync motors of film camera 11 . Sync converter unit 19 derives it s sync pulse from 46 output of the tri pulse phaser shown in FIG.11. The three Tensional holografic camera 4 can be any of the previous four embodiments of FIG.13,14,or15.A film transfer can be made simultaneously during film to tape transfer via lead 8 . A three dimensional holografic video tape played onVideo tape recorder 9 and fed via line 18 to monitor 10 and filmed by filmcamera 11 will produce a film version encoded with three dimensional holografic imagry. FIG.1 is an embodiment describing a method and apparatus for processing two dimensional pre recorded video tape electronic signals into three dimensional transfers or copies transfering simultaneously to video and film reproductions for viewing visual scenes in three dimens ional holografic and stereografic viewing, which comprises taking the output of video tape recorder 2 , or any video source, to line 4t to standard television monitor 1 .Three dimensional holografic camera 7 , or any oneof the three embodiments described in FIGS. 13,14, or15 is focused on the screen of monitor 1 sending processed video imagry via line 12 simultaneously to recording video tape recorder 13 and TV monitor 17B where film camera 18 photographs moving pictures encoded with three dimensional holografic and stereografic imagry. Motion picture film camera 18 is synced to television camera 7 by sync converter power unit 19 via line 153 . The sync converter power unit 19 is synced from 4 46 output of tri pulse phaser of FIG.11 via line 15 . Referring now to FIG.18 thereis shown an embodiment in which a two dimensional visual scene from any conventional video recording, film or disc source or program may be processed and encoded into a three dimensional holografic reproduction of the same visual scene and simultaneously or seperately transfered to video tape or film, and bymuting the processed video signals through a conventional video switcher said three dimensional holografic encoded video signals may be fed to conventional distribution outlets such as a transmitter, satellite uplink, cable system VTR and or processed for video tape, video disc, or any other distribution method or apparatus which is designed to reproduce electronic pictures from video signals of a said three dimensional holografic visual scene encoded by methods and apparatus as described in this embodiment and other embodiments of this disclosure.ThiS embodiment shows the original video signal coming from video tape player 1 via switch 1A to standard demodulation chip or section 2 , sucn as utilized in standard and known aS demodulation circuits of an ordinary television receiver. At demodulation section 2 , audio2Aa d horizontal 23 and verticaldrive sync signals are decoded and stripped,Horizontal sync is sent to the tri pulse phaser 24 via syne bus 30 and returned to the re modulation section 18 . The vertical drive sync portion of sync is sent to the tri pulse phaser via sync bus 31 and routed on to the re modulation section 18 , where it iscombined with horizontal sync into a composite sync signal and modulated into the compositevideo remodulated signal. Audio via line 36 is also,routed to the re modulation section 18 . The remaining de modulatSd red 8 , green 7 , and blue 6 video signals are routed from the de modulation circuit to analog to digital converterS 3 , 4 and 5 .The red digital signal 9 is routed to digital delay unit 1QL to be described in FIG.19 where the imagry is optionally offset slightly Ito 16 mirco secQs to effect the psuedo three dimensional effectVia word bust1A the digital red video voltage is switched or processed by 8bit tri state gate 129 as pulsed by the tri pulse phaser 24 via lead 28 through triple single throw preset switch 29A connecting to P3 of the said pulser 24 .In a similar manner the blue digital word voltages 9C is processed. The varable digital delay is programed for 0 microseconds and enters the blue digial word bus 11C where it is intercepted by tri state 8bit switch 12C which is controlled and switched by the P output waveform pulse of tri pulse phaser 24 through switch 24A andonward via lead 29 to the control gate 12cmThe green video digital word voltages in this embodiment is switched permantly on by switch 24A to the I VTD buss bar which turns on a logic 1 or positive Vpp voltage permantly to the gate of 8bit tristate logic switch 12B to leave the green unmuted to process the video R,G,B voltages as shown in waveform charts ofFIG.9.Via digital word bus bars 11A , 113 , and 11C the digital word values of the R,B,G, voltages are sent to digital to analog coverter 13A , 13B and 13C bor conversion back to analog signalswhere they are routed individually ot the re modulation 17 R,G,B inputs via lines 14A , 14B and 14C . The R,B,G video is then re modulated in one RF envelope also containing horizontal and vertical sync along with audio and exited on bus 26 as a single RF video signal to VTR recorder 21 and TV monitor 25 for the filming process of film camera 22 which is synchronized by filmsync power line 23 from the power.sync generator 2OA which is controlled by theX sync output pulses46 of tri pulse phaser 24 . Video tape recorder 21 will accomodate the optional psuedo stereo delay 40 via lead 41 . Video output 26A willfeedany video signal user device to process and reproduce the three dimensional psuedo holografic imagry. FIG.19 shows a 0 16 micro second digital line delay capable of receiving and delaying a video signal on a single bus utilizing 8bit tri state buffers 10 and 11 in conjunction with data bus 9 staggered or delayed by counters 3 and 4 which are alternately gated by 4bit tri state buffers 6 and 7 to the memory address 12. A flip flop 2 directs traffic via controllines 2A and 2B , fromQ and , and is clocked and synchronized by clock input 1 via line 1A from the output of full wave rectifier 34A , of FIG.18 which also runs or syncs the A D and D A converters of FIG.18.By setting the presettable digital switch 5 to any number betweenO and 15 a zero to 15 micro second digital delay is achieved and data is read off of data bus 9 from memory 5 through 8bit tri state buffer gate 11 . FIG.20 is a description of a synchronized scanning laser lighting system which may be utilized with any of the three dimensional holografic camera described in FIG.13, 14, or 1 i. Instead of using spreader lenses as has been employed in prior art for laser holography in conjunction with TV lighting, this embodiment shall employ a system of synchronized scanning laser beams which is made to lock in step with the scanning pick up tubes of the television camera, line for line in the subraster scan of the TV pick up tubes the laser is started simultaneously in step at the same speed on each successive line scan. TheTV camera will see at any precise moment of time only the dot of light being lit or lighted by the laser on the subject at that precise moment.The laser will be made to scan at TV camera speed, 15,734 line scan per second 262 lines per 1 60th second for one sub raster or complete scan, sixty scans per second. The scanning laser lighting system has the effect of multiplying the the effective illumination power of the lasers on theTV screen approximately 68,906 times or by the product of the square of line count per subraster or complete picture scan, and inversly diminishing khe apparant needed intensity of the laser bythe same factor namely, 1 68,906 making it safe to eluminate scenes with humanactors and making the laser light scan almost invisable.Vertical drive clock 26 syncs vertical drive amp 25 which via line 24 powers magnet 16 which causes mirror 12 to oscillate at sixty cycles per second by attracting and repelling magnet 15 mounted on cantelever arm 14 which is pivioted at 14A spring balanced by adjustable screw connector 44 . 15,734 Hz square wave horizontal scan clock 27 syncs variable horizontal power amp 28 which powers electric magnet 32 via line 40 with horizontal speed, powers pulses which alternately atracks and repels permanent magnet 32A . This causes mirror 37 to oscillate at 15,734 Hz which deflects laser beam 34 beamed from laser 33 in a horizontal scanning motion reflected to mirror 12 where it is deflected in a vertical motion at 60 Hz to accomplish the subraster scan.The scanned ing laser beam, at the beginning of each horizontal scan croses photo transistor 13 which produces a hor izontal sync pulse which via line 17 is fed to horizontal pulse amp 21 and onward via line 18 to synchronize the cammera and associated sync generators to run the horizontal deflection coils of the pick up tubes it , 13 and 1C of television camera 1 . The vert cal drive pulse is obtained in a like manner. Photo transistor 42 is positioned on the 1st scan of the 262 line scans downward from the viberating vertical scanning mirror 12 . It s pulses via line 9 are fed to a vertical drive pulse amp 31 which feeds a verti cal drive sync pulse via line 29 to the TV camera 1 . vertical drive input circuits 48 which controls the vertical deflection coils of the TV camera pick up tubes it , 1B and 1C .As the laser beam is scanning it is passed through wave retarder 10 which in conjunction with optical treatment by cube polorizing beam splitter 5 is adjusted to deflect a small percentage of the scanning laser beam power to half silvered mirror 4 back into the TV camera lens 2 for holografic light interference.Reflected scanning laser light from the subject being taken is returned through holografic square lens 3 through the back of partially silvered mirror 4 through lens 2 to the R ,3 ,G, scanning tubes it , 1B and 1C of the television camera. Viberating mirrors 12 and 37 may optionally be replaced by a synchronously rotating morror system.The laser 33 may be frequency modulated by the laser modulator 34 which is control pulsed, modulated, by the output of the variable clock 5A of tri pulse phaser of FIG.11, via line 34A . FIG.21 shows optional laser camera alignment of the scanning laser system described in FIG.20 and optional mirror positions in reference to the subject which the TV camera is focused. TV camera 4 can be any of the previous camera embodiments of Figures 13, 14, or 15. Laser. 9 is the laser described in FIG.20. Pulser 3 is the tri phase pulser of FIG. 11.An adjustable bracket 22 which has slotted groves 23 24 is means for position or alignment of laser 9 to raster scanning of camera 4 . Laser beam splitter 18 is focussed and aimed or aligned by adjustable slots 21 , to direct laser scanning beam 19As3 through holografic square lens 20 as described in FIG. 12 to mirror 18A where scanning laser beam 16B is aligned to the studio floor 24 where some of the laser light is reflected upward to the subject matter 25 , and back into the lens system 7 and 6 .The variable clock output of pulser 3 , the tri pulse phaser of FIG. 11 via line 3A is fed to the modulator 34 of FIG. 20 of laser 9 . Laser 9 control unit 2 via vertical drive pulses on sync line 12 and horizontal sync pulse of line 13. The camera control unit 2 in turn sends these sync signals to the camera 4 , via camera sync bus 11 and to the pulser 3 via horizontal sync line 14 and vertical drive sync line 15 .
