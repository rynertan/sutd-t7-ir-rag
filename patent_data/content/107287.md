# Ultrasonic beam focusing device with a concave surface and method of manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic beam focusing device with a concave sur face comprises a cylindrical housing 14 , a circular piezoelec tric polymer film 11 curved to have a concave shape relative to an acoustically active surface thereof and having a pair of circular electrodes at two surfaces thereof, for generating an ultrasonic beam focused at a point and for transducing the re ceived ultrasonic beam into electric signals, leads 13a, 13b respectively connected to the electrodes, a rigid polyurethane layer 15 formed in tight contact with an electrode 12b inside the housing at the side of an acoustically inactive surface of the piezoelectric polymer film, for absorbing an ultrasonic beam at the side of the acoustically inactive surface and for supporting the piezoelectric polymer film and an insulating layer 16 formed in contact with an electrode 12a for electri cally insulating the electrode 12a .
