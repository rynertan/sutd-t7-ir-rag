# GRAPHIC INPUT OUTPUT DEVICE INCLUDING A FIBER OPTIC BUNDLE WITH ELECTRONIC MEANS FOR PROVIDING COHERENCE

## Abstract
Coherence of an optical fiber bundle with randomly different geometries at its two ends is achieved electronical ly. A photosensitive random access memory is used as a sensor array to determine the addresses of fiber at which light exits when light is sequentially directed into consecu tive fibers at the other end. The addresses are stored in a ROM and used to provide coherence of an otherwise unordered fiber optic bundle having one end formed in a linear array, for example, and used to scan documents. A printer also is described using electronically achieved coher ence.
