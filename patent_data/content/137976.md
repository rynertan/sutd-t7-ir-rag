# INTERFEROMETRIC METROLOGY OF SURFACE FIGURES

## Abstract
A diffraction grating with circular grooves whose fre quency is a radial variable useful as a null corrector in an apparatus for testing the optical figure of a surface. A cir cularly ruled grating with unequal spaces between rulings functions to cause the rays of a monochromatic beam reflect ed from or transmitted through the test surface to be reflect ed or transmitted as a substantially perfect wavefront. This permits the reflected or transmitted beam to be combined with a reference beam to form a fringe pattern indicative of deviation of the test surface from the required surface figure.
