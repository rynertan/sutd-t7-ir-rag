# Portable computer.

## Abstract
In the disclosed portable computer, a keyboard with keys for entering at least a full alphabet and ten digits is coupled to a computer system that includes a central processing unit which is in turn coupled to a display arrangement with a liquid crystal display. The entire computer is mounted in a case composed of a base and a cover hinged to the base. The base houses the computer system and the keyboard, and exposes the keyboard for operation by user when the cover is open, while the cover houses the display arrangement and exposes the liquid crystal display on its inner surface. The cover is hinged at the edge of the case and, when closed, covers substantially the entire upper surface of the base.
