# Earthing switch for gas insulated switchgear apparatus.

## Abstract
An earthing switch for gas insulated switchgear appar atus is disclosed, in which conductor 10 within an enclosure 1 is provided with a stationary contact 11 , and a moving contact 7 is movably provided to connect with and disconnect from the stationary contact 11 by an operating mechanism 5, 6 within an operating mechanism case 4 which is mounted on a branch tube 2 of the enclosure 1 interposing an insulating plate 3 therebetween. For con necting the moving contact 7 to the enclosure 1 electrical ly, a plurality of earthing bars 9a, 9b are employed, and further, directions of electromagnetic forces f₂, f₂ gener ated between the moving contact 7 and individual earthing bars 9a, 9b are considered in the connection of the earthing bars. By virtue of the connection of the plurality of earthing bars, the influence of the electromagnetic forces acting on the moving contact can be reduced to a great extent.
