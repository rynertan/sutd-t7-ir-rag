# SAFETY SLIP COUPLING

## Abstract
A safety coupling of slip coupling type comprising an in going or drive shaft 1 , which in an axially displaceable manner carries a pressure disc 6 , an out going or driven shaft 2 which in turn carries a counter pressure disc 11 , means eg. springs 12 which force the pressure disc 6 into friction engagement with the counter pressure disc 11 . The drive shaft 1 also carries a fluid tight coupling case 3 enclosing both coupling discs 6, 11 and which contains a determined amount of pressure medium which forms to a rotating ring or mass of oil 21 as the coupling case rotates. The pressure disc 6 and the counter pressure disc 11 form between them a closed cavity 15 which connects via one or several channels 16 to the rotating oil mass 21 in the coupling case 3 . The orifice 18 of the channels can be faced in an opposite direction to the normal direction of rotation of the coupling case. With the incurrence of relative rotation between in and out going shafts, oil is pressed from the rotating mass of oil 21 , through the channel or channels 16 , to the closed cavity 15 of the coupling discs where a pressure is built up and releases the coupling discs.
