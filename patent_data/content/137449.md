# Method for producing thermoplastic resin sheet or filler containing resin sheet.

## Abstract
A method for producing a thermoplastlc resin sheet or a filler containing thermoplastic resin sheet by which method a difficulty workable thermoplastic resin as well as an ordinary thermoplastic resin can be formed into a sheet and various kinds of flllers can be compounded into the sheet. The method is characterized in that a thermoplastic resin or a composition of a thermoplastic resin and a filler is fed in powder or preformed sheet form between a pair of tensioned endless belts disposed parallel and travelling together around a set of rolls, the endless belts being heated by being brought into surface to surface contact with heating rolls while travelling along a path having at least one bend formed by the heating rolls, and the material is heated and compressed between the endless belts and melted into an integral body at or above the melting point or softening point of the thermoplastic resin.
