# Conjugate filament spinning process.

## Abstract
In spinning a conjugate filament, the orifice is in the form of a slot 20 , and an interface 26 between two conjugated polymers flowing through the orifice extends transversely across the slot in at least two locations. The spun stream thus comprises a plurality of separate spun interfaces. Preferably the slot meanders back and forth across the interface 26 . The spun stream is solidified, and may thereafter be separated into sub filaments. The two polymers are for example nylon 66 and polyethylene terephthalate.
