# Apparatus for manipulating a quantity of radioactive material between a stored position and a use position.

## Abstract
Apparatus for manipulating a quantity of radioactive material between a stored position and a use position includ ing a capsule of said radioactive material, a storage unit 20 for the capsule 32 with a shielded passage 25 , manipulat ing means moving the capsule 32 between a stored position and a use position outside a second end of the passage 25 , a shutter 40 at the second end of the passage 25 having two positions closing the passage and permitting the capsule 32 passing through. A springbiased tube 48 in the passage fits in a recess 86 around the hole for retaining the shutter 40 in the open position and this tube can be pulled back from the shutter 40 by a fitting attached to the capsule 32 when the latter is in its stored position, releasing the shutter 40 to return it to a position in which it closes the passage. An interlock is provided to prevent accidental opening of the shutter 40 .
