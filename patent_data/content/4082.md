# Method for energizing high pressure metal vapour discharge lamps.

## Abstract
A lighting equipment comprises a high pressure metal vapor discharge lamp having a lamp voltage of 145 to 180 V actuated by a lag type ballast having a secondary voltage of lower than 220 V or a high pressure metal vapor discharge lamp having a lamp voltage of 150 to 200 V actuated by a lag type ballast having a secondary voltage of higher than 220 V whereby a consumed power is reduced in comparison with the conventional lighting device.
