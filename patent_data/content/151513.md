## Description
INOTROPIC AGENT This invention provides an orally effective, long acting, positive inotropic agent useful for long term management of heart failure. The cardiac glycosides and the sympathomimetic amines are the principal inotropic agents used in the management of congestive heart failure. Although the cardiac glycosides, especially digitalis, are among the most frequently prescribed drugs, they have numerous liabilities such as a low therapeutic index and erratic absorption, and are associated with life threatening arrhythmias and deleterious drug drug interactions. In addition, many patients either do not respond, or become refractory to these agents. The sympathomimetic amines, such as dopamine and epinephrine, have limited utility due to positive chronotropic effects, arrhythmogenic properties, and oral ineffectiveness. Many propanolamine derivatives are known in the art to be p adrenergic blocking agents useful in the treatment of a variety of cardiovascular conditions such as angina pectoris and hypertension. Certain propanolamines, such as some of those described inCanadian Patent No. 1,134,843 and U.S. Patents No.4,027,027 and 4,244,969, are taught to possess 8 stimulating or ss agonist activity thereby making the compounds useful as positive inotropic agents. This invention provides the compound 4 3 R 2 hydroxy 3 3 hydroxyphenoxy propyl amino butyl benzamide and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.For purposes of this disclosure, the compound and its salts will hereinafter be referred to collectively asCompound I. Compound I is an orally effective, long acting, positive inotropic agent which should be useful for the long term management of heart failure. According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical formulation which comprises as active ingredient Compound I associated with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Compound I contains two asymmetric centers. It is critical for this invention that the chiral center at the 3 position of the.butylbenzamide moiety is in theR configuration. The 2 hydroxy group of the propanolamine portion of the molecule may be in the R or preferably theS configuration or the compound may be employed as the mixture of the two isomers. Therefore, this invention includes both 4 3 R 2 R hydroxy 3 3 hydroxy phenoxy propyl amino butyl benzamide and 4 3 R 2 S hydroxy 3 3 hydroxyphenoxy propyl 1 amino butyl benzamide as well as the mixture thereof. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of Compound I include salts derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, phosphorous acid and the like, as well as salts derived from nontoxic organic acids such as aliphatic mono and di carboxylic acids, phenyl substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic and alkanedioic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids, etc. The preferred salts of Compound I are those derived from inorganic acids, especially hydrochloric acid. Compound I can be prepared by any of a number of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited by, the following reactions a The reaction of a l 3 blocked hydroxyphenoxy 2, 3 epoxypropane with 4 3 aminobutyl benzamide b The reaction of a l 3 blocked hydroxyphenoxy 2 hydroxy 3 halopropane with 4 3 aminobutyl benzamide c The reaction of resorcinol with 4 3 2,3 epoxypropyl3amino butyl benzamide d The reaction of resorcinol with a 4 3 3 halo 2 hydroxypropylamino butyl benzamide e The reaction of a 3 3 blocked hydroxyphenoxy 2 hydroxy l aminopropane with a 4 3 halobutyl benzamide and f The reaction of 3 3 hydroxyphenoxy 2 hydroxy l aminopropane with 4 4 carbamoylphenyl 2 butanone under hydrogenation conditions. In methods a , b , and e above, the term blocked hydroxy refers to a hydroxy group which is blocked with a nonreactive functionality. These reactions provide blocked intermediates of Compound I which are then deblocked by a subsequent transformation. Although many such blocking groups are known to those skilled in the art, the preferred group for this process is the benzyl group which can be removed by hydrogenation. Hydrogenation is usually performed in the presence of a catalyst, such as Raney nickel or palladium on carbon, in a solvent such as methanol or ethanol. In the reactions involving epoxide intermediates methods a and c , the reaction between the two compounds is best performed with a slight molar excess of the epoxy intermediate. The reactions are usually heated at temperatures of 40 1000C., with or without the presence of a nonreactive solvent, such as dioxane, dimethylformamide, or an alcohol. The reaction is usually complete within 1 24 hours. In reactions b , d , and e , halo may be chloro, bromo, fluoro, or iodo, with chloro and bromo being preferred. The reactions are generally carried out in a nonreactive solvent such as dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, hexamethylphosphoramide, alcohols, and the like, preferably in the presence of an acid scavenger, such as sodium bicarbonate. The coupling reaction can be carried out at temperatures ranging from about OOC. to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. A temperature of about 20 600C. is preferred. The reactants are generally reacted in eguimolar amounts although other ratios are operative. Method f is a reductive amination procedure known in the art. The reaction of the two reactants results in the loss of water and the formation of an imine intermediate which is subsequently hydrogenated by standard methods to form the desired Compound I. This hydrogenation procedure introduces a new chiral center and generally yields a mixture of diastereomeric products unless a selective catalyst is used which can impart selective generation of a particular configuration. As will be recognized by one skilled in the art, in methods a e , if one or both chiral centers of the reactant s are unresolved, the resulting intermediate and product will be a mixture of diastereomers which can then be resolved by methods known in the art, if desired. Alternatively, the reactant s may be first prepared or resolved as a single optically active isomer and then reacted to directly produce the corresponding optically active diastereomer of Compound I. Variations on the above reaction schemes will be obvious to those skilled in the art. For instance, instead of using benzamide reagents, the corresponding benzonitrile intermediate may be employed producing the corresponding nitrile analog of Compound I. This nitrile compound is known in the art See U.S. Patent No.4,210,653, Example 6 . The nitrile intermediate may then be hydrolyzed by standard methods to the desired benzamideCompound I. Alternatively, a benzoate ester of the corresponding benzamide intermediates may be employed producing the analogous benzoate of the desired product.This ester may then be subject to ammonolysis to prepare the desired benzamide compound. Other reaction schemes are apparent from the literature. See generally U.S. Patents No. 4,195,090 and 4,018,824, and Canadian Patent No. 1,134,843. The intermediates required to prepare the compound of this invention are either known in the art or can be prepared by published methods. Thus, one aspect of the invention is a process for preparing 4 3 R 2 hydroxy 3 3 hydroxyphenoxy propyl amino butyl benzamide, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which comprises reacting 4 3 R aminobutyl benzamide with l 3 blocked hydroxyphenoxy 2,3 epoxypropane, to produce a blocked intermediate, removing the blocking group, and, if desired, salifying the intermediate or the final product. Compound I may be administered by various routes including the oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, sublingual, intravenous, intramuscular, or intranasal routes, being usually employed in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. It is a special feature thatCompound I is an effective positive inotrope agent following oral administration. Such compositions are prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art and comprise at least one active compound. Accordingly, the invention includes pharmaceutical compositions comprising as active ingredient Compound I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, associated with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In making the compositions of the present invention, Compound I will usually be mixed with a carrier, or diluted by a carrier, or enclosed within a carrier which may be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container. When the carrier serves as a diluent, it may be a solid, semi solid or liquid material which acts as a vehicle, excipient or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the composition can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols as a solid or in a liquid medium , ointments containing for example up to 10 by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions and sterile packaged powders. Some examples of suitable carriers are lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water, syrup, methyl cellulose, methyl and propylhydroxybenzoates, talc, magnesium stearate or mineral oil. The formulations can additionally include lubricating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, preserving agents, sweetening agents or flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention may, as is well known in the art, be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained, or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient. The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 1 to 50 mg., more usually 5 to 30 mg., of Compound I. The term unit dosage form refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity ofCompound I calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Compound I is effective over a wide dosage range. For example, dosages per day will normally fall within the range of about 0.05 to 3 mg. kg. In the treatment of adult humans, the range of about 0.1 to 0.5 mg. kg., in single or divided doses, is preferred.However, it will be understood that the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances including the chosen route of administration, and the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, and therefore the above dosage ranges are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. The following examples further illustrate the preparation of the compound and formulations of this invention. The examples are illustrative only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way.

PHENOBARBITAL ANESTHETIZED DOG STUDY Mongrel dogs of either sex weighing 8 20 kg.were anesthetized with sodium thiopental 15 mg. kg., i.v. and sodium phenobarbital 100 mg. kg., i.v. . A positive pressure pump provided ventilation through a cuffed endotracheal tube 18 strokes minute, 20 ml. kg.Atroke and a heating pad kept the body temperature at 37 380C. Both vagus nerves were sectioned through an incision in the neck. Arterial blood pressure was monitored using a Statham pressure transducer attached to a cannula filled with heparinized saline 16 units ml. inserted into the abdominal aorta via the right femoral artery. A cannula connected to a three way stopcock was inserted in the right femoral vein for drug administration. The heart was exposed through the fifth right intercostal space and a precalibrated Walton Brodie strain gauge arch was sutured on the right ventricle.The strain gauge was adjusted to a tension of 50 gm. at systole and the Beckman Dynograph recorder was set so that 50 gm. tension produced a pen deflection of 10 mm. Heart rate was derived electronically from the blood pressure pulse using a Beckman cardiotachometer coupler. Isoproterenol hydrochloride was dissolved and injected in acidified pH 6.0 water. The doses of isoproterenol were 0.025, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mcg. kg.Compound I hydrochloride was dissolved and injected in sterile water. Doses were given at 5 minute intervals. An isoproterenol standard curve was obtained in each dog and responses to the compound were adjusted according to the isoproterenol sensitivity. Results of this study are summarized in Table 1.

CONSCIOUS INSTRUMENTED DOG STUDY Male mongrel dogs weighing 15.4 to 38.3 kg. were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital 30 mg. kg., i.v. and ventilated through a cuffed endotracheal tube 18 strokes minute, 20 ml. kg. stroke with a positive pressure pump. Body temperature was maintained at 37 380C. with a heating pad. The heart was exposed through the left, fifth, intercostal space and a pre calibrated Konigsberg implantable pressure transducer was positioned in the left ventricle through a stab wound in the apex of the heart. The transducer connector cable was led dorsally beneath the skin to a point 5 cm.anterior to the shoulder blades. The chest was closed and evacuated. Dogs received antibiotics and at least two weeks were allowed for recovery before testing. Dogs were conditioned to the testing laboratory prior to the study. They were confined to a pen and restrained with a tether with sufficient freedom to either stand or lie during the study. The Konigsberg pressure transducer was connected to a Beckman R 611 recorder. Left ventricular pressure and calculated cardiac inotropic activity was monitored by measuring the first derivative of the left ventricular pressure tracing when pressure reached 60 mm Hg. Heart rate was recorded by means of aBeckman cardiotachometer coupler driven from the left ventricular pressure wave. After a 20 30 minute control period, dogs received a capsule containing either CompoundI hydrochloride at 0.5 mg. kg. or placebo lactose .Measurements were obtained between 0 12 hours after dosing. No significant differences were seen between the placebo and Compound I in heart rate or arterial pressure.The comparative data for cardiac contractility is summarized in Table 2.
