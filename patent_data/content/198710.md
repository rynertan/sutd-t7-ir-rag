## Description
Pouring Funnel This invention relates to pouring funnels, and particularly to funnels adapted for filling containers having relatively narrow necks, with liquids. Particularly in their application to photographic apparatus, a common problem with pouring funnels is that the liquid tends to swirl as it is dragged into the tube of the funnel, and this impedes the flow, reducing its speed. When it is desired to quickly fill a container such as a developing tank, slow filling can be a serious problem since it can result in films being unevenly developed and thus completely spoiled. One of the reasons for slow filling of developing tanks in the past, was the lack of venting to allow air to escape from the tank, and modern designs invariably include some form of venting.However, it has been found that venting alone is not sufficient to prevent the swirling action mentioned above, and the present invention seeks to overcome this particular problem. Accordingly, the present invention provides a pouring funnel including at least one radially extending internal baffle member, whereby liquid which is poured down the funnel is substantially prevented from swirling. The invention also extends to a detachable baffle member which is adapted to be inserted into the neck of a conventional funnel, so as to prevent swirling taking place. According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a film development tank including a funnel part for filling the tank, which incorporates at least one radially extending baffle member. It will be appreciated that, in accordance with the invention, a funnel may be provided with more than one radially extending baffle member, and in a preferred arrangement, a pair of such radially extending baffles are provided, on opposite sides of the funnel neck, so as to extend acroSs a diameter of the funnel. Some embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure la is an axial cross section of a first funnel in accordance with the invention Figure Ib is a top plan view of the funnel of Figure la Figure 2a is an axial cross section through a second funnel Figure 2b is a top plan view of the funnel of Figure 2a Figure 3a is an axial cross section of a developing tank incorporating a funnel in accordance with the invention Figure 3b is a top plan view of the developing tank ofFigure 3a Figure 4a is an axial cross section through a third type of funnel Figure 4b is a side elevation of the funnel of Figure 4a as seen in the direction of arrow A Figure 4c is a top plan view of the funnel of Figures 4a and 4b Figure 4d is a partial cross section through the wall of the funnel of Figures 4a to 4c Figure Sa is a side elevation of a baffle component Figure Sb is a side elevation of the baffle component ofFigure 5a taken at right angles to the view of Figure Sa and Figure Sc is a top plan view of the baffle component ofFigures 5a and Sb and Figure 5d is a side elevation of a modified form of baffle of the type shown in Figure 5a. Figure I shows a funnel basically conventional external shape, having a tapered main body 2 of generally frusto conical form, with a narrow neck 4 which, in use, is placed in the neck of a container to be filled. A pair of baffles 6 are arranged on opposite sides of the internal surface of the frusto conical portion, so as to substantially prevent swirling of the liquid poured into the funnel. Two alternative forms of baffle are shown, one having an angular profile while the other is smoothly curved. Figure 2 shows a funnel which is basically similar to that of Figure 1, but has a shallower cone angle so that the upper portion 2 of its body is generally cylindrical. Again, the internal surface of the portion 2 is provided on its tapered base part 8, with internal baffles 6. Figure 3 shows a photographic developing tank 10 having a generally drum shaped body 12 which receives a film spiral assembly 14 in a manner known per se . The lid 16 of the tank incorporates a generally funnel shaped internal part 18, having a shallowly tapered base 20 leading to a neck 22 through which liquid is passed into the interior of the tank. Radially extending baffles 24 are arranged on either side of the neck portion 22. Again, two different forms of baffle are shown, having different profiles, and these can also be made removable, as described below with reference to Figure 5. One example of a suitably shaped removable baffle is shown in Figure 5d. Alternatively they may be made retractable into the surface of the lid, into suitably light proof recesses. Figure 4 shows a funnel which is generally similar in configuration to that of Figure 2, in that it has a generally drum. shaped body 2 and internal baffles 6, but in this case the baffles are hollow, their interior being open to the outside of the funnel. See section E E in Figure 4d . This allows air to be freely vented from the container, as indicated by the arrows 30. Figure 5 shows an insert which is adapted to be positioned in a conventional funnel, or developing tank funnel so as to provide it with baffles to assist in filling. The insert comprises a generally cruciform base part 32, which is adapted to be positioned in the central neck portion of the funnel, and a pair of upstanding wings 34 which form radially extending baffles when the device is positioned inside the funnel, in use. As can be appreciated from the drawings, the insert can be easily moulded in a single piece of plastics material. It can be used with an ordinary funnel or with a developing tank of the kind shown in Figure 3.
