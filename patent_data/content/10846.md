# Method and apparatus for determining the minimum concentration of antibiotic to inhibit microorganism growth.

## Abstract
A fixed functional relationship in either tabular or equation form is established between the growth of various microorganisms in the presence of a few e.g., one or two predetermined concentrations 108 of a predetermined antibiotic and the minimum concentration of such anti biotic necessary to at least inhibit the activity of such sam ples. The relationships are established for each desired combination of antibiotic and general class of microorgan isms and the degree of growth 112 is measured at a pre determined time or level of growth, preferably before satu ration occurs at growth or no growth extremes. The minimum concentrations used in deriving these fixed rela tionships are determined by standard accepted quantitative techniques. Thereafter, the minimum concentration of the predetermined antibiotic necessary to at least inhibit the activity of any given pathogenic microorganism 116 taken from the same predetermined general class of organisms may be rapidly and accurately determined by 1 measur ing the growth of such sampled pathogenic organism 120 after the same predetermined time in the presence of the same few e.g., one or two predetermined concentrations of the antibiotic and 2 using the resulting measurements together with the previously established fixed functional relationship to identify the required minimum concentration for that particular combination of microorganism, and anti biotic. Apparatus for semiautomatically and for automati cally carrying out this method are also disclosed.
