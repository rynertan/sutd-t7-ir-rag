# Monopulse detection systems.

## Abstract
A planar array 13 of radar antenna elements B used in a monopulse detection system includes means to apply an ap propriate phase by the phase delay 4 on transmission and reception so as to define only two beams. Received signals are added to give a sum beam 22 , and for a normal beam per pendicular to the plane of the array appropriately weighted, signals are added in phase in a resistor network F₁. A single difference beam 27 is generated by added receiver outputs in a second resistor network F₂ with each output phase delayed 23 by a phase angle equal to the angular position of the de tector measured from the array centre with respect to the array centre line 14 . Then a target position can be defined by taking the ratio of the amplitudes and the relative phases of signals received by the sum and difference beams. Beam steering is done by applying additional phase delays to both beams to tilt the phase planes of the array as desired.

## Description
Thinrovements in or Relating to Mononulse Detection Systems The invention relates to detector arrays used in active or passive detection systems for producing monopulse tracking. Conventional monopulse tracking systems require three channels to define the positions of targets within the beams of an array of detectors. Two signal difference channels are required to give information on the target offset in two perpendicular directions and a sum channel gives amplitude information. Comparison of the magnitude and sign of these difference signals with the sum signals then gives a target s position relative to the centres of the beams. The object of the present invention is to provide an alternative form of monopulse detection system which requires only two channels to determine the position of targets and is particularly relevant to circular arrays. The invention provides a monopulse system for detecting energy received from a target comprising a planar array of detectors responsive to the received energy, a sum channel for adding together outputs from all detectors and means to derive the position of the target, characterised in that there is provided only one difference channel, both for applying to the output of each detector a fixed polar phase delay which is linear in the range 0 25rF, or an integral multiple thereof, in dependence on the angular position of each detector in the plane of the array and for adding together the product signals formed thereby, and the means for deriving the position of the target uses a comparison of the outputs from the sum channel and the difference channel. The invention thus requires only two channels, one of which produces a sum beam and the other a difference beam wherein the relative amplitudes determine the target s angular offset and the relative phases determine the direction of this off set as projected on the plane of the array. The array may be a uniform distribution of detectors as for example by placing detectors at the interstices of a rectangular grid. However in order to reduce the overall system complexity the invention may also be applied to a thinned array wherein selected detectors are omitted from the uniform array. In the preferred arrangement the array consists of waveguide a r tures, dipoles or similar elements for the radiation and reception of r.f. energy. During reception each element may be connected to a receiver which amplifies and or converts to a lower frequency the energy emitted or reflected by targets. The separate outputs are then preferably passed through selectable phase delays employed for beam steering. The separate phase delayed outputs are added directly to form the sum beam and are also added after applying the fixed polar phase delays to form the difference beam. With the selectable phase delays set to zero the sum and difference beams are circularly symmetric about the normal to the plane of the array with a central peak and a central null respectively. By applying phase delays linearly dependent on the positions of the elements in the array, the phase plane may be tilted relative to the plane of the array, thereby steering the beams. Circuitry may be included in the system to automatically steer the sum and difference beams to maintain a target on the axis of the sum beam. Side lobes in the radiation patterns of both the sum and the differ ence beams may be attenuated by carrying out the addition of the respective signals in the two channels in weighting circuits, wherein each detector output is weighted as a function of the distance of the detector from the centre of the array. The fixed polar 0 2phase delays applied to the receiver outputs in the difference channel tt ay be introduced by appropriate lengths of transmission line connecting the receivers to the difference chtxlel addition circuit. In order that these features may be more fully appreciated the invention will now be described by way of exule only with reference to the accompanying drawings of which Figure 1 is a schematic arrangement to illustrate a monopulse radar tracking antenna Figure 2 is a functional circuit diagram of a monopulse tracking radar Figure 3 is a circuit diagram of signal processing circuits in a conventional monopulse radar figure 4 is a circuit diagram of signal processing circuits according to the invention for producing a polar coordinate monopulse radar Figure 5 is a geometrical representation of the planar array used to define the polar coordinate monopulse radar and Figure 6 illustrates the radiation patterns response curves of the two beans of the polar monopulse radar. Monopulse systems started with the use of four horn aerials in a square formation feeding a reflector. A typical arrangement is shownIn figure 1 wherein the four rectangular horns A,B,C and D are placed on the axis of a reflector tt. The respective signals received from the horns A to D ray be resFectively added and subtracted to give a sun signal S and two difference signals at anday as follows S A B C D x A D B C y A B C D by comparing the magnitude and sign of the difference signals and he with the sum signal S an azimuth and an elevation servo motor connected to the aerial system can be driven in the appropriate directions to reduce the difference signals to zero and so keep track of a target. Dhis system of separate Ax and Ay signal channels had been adopted in conventional aerial arrays employing a centralised transmitter and receivers with r.f. feeder networks to isolate the sun and the two difference signals. Since the feeder networks are normally disposed horizontally and vertically the provision of separate rectangular coordinate x and y difference signal channels is a logical arrangement. however this is no longer necessary in an electronically scanned active array in which each element or small group of elements within the arrayIs associated with a separate receiver. It is now possible to provide lease shifts by I or digital processing. With this type of processing two or more outputs of any desired phase can be obtained from each receiver With no loss of signal to noise ratio. inure 2 shows a planar antenna array A, circular or near circularIn shape, which is fully or partially filled with antenna elements B. je of the elements B is connected to a transmitter 1 or a receiver 2 according to whether the associated switches S1,2 and 33 are respectively in the lower position as shown or the upper position. During transmission, power from the transmitter 1 is fed via a divider 3 to all the radiating antenna elements B via respective phase shifters 4. The output from each phase shifter 4 may be fed via an optional amplifier 5 to the antenna element B. During reoeption,the divider 3 is used to feed power for a local oscillator 6 via the respective phase shifters 4 and inputs 7 to rf mixers in the receivers 2. Signals received in the antenna elements B are fed to inputs 8 in the respective receivers 2 where they are down converted to an IF frequency signal at the receiver output 9. For both transmission and reception the direction of maximum gain the main beam is controlled by the settings of the phase shifters 4. In the conventional system the output signal from each receiver 2 is processed as shown in Figure 3 to provide three IF outputs 10, 11 and 12. For the sum signal output 11 equivalent to S all the receiver outputs 9 have equal path lengths to the resistor network F, where they are summed. In most cases signals received by antenna elements 13 towards the edge of the array A have additional resistive attenuation 14 say in order to suppress side lobes in the antenna sensitivity pattern.For the azimuth signal output 10 equivalent to the signals from all the antenna elements to the left of the centre line 14 of the array A are summed in anti phase to those on the right in the network F Thus the signal from each receiver output 9 is fed to the network F2 via a phase delay 15 set to 0 or radians depending upon whether the associated antenna element B is respectively to the left or right of the array centre line 14.Similarly for the elevation signal output 12 eçuivalent to 4 signals from antenna elements above the array centre line 16 are summed in antiphase to those below in the network F . Signals from each receiver output 9 are fed via a phase delay 17 to the network F3 with the phase delay set to 0 or It radiants depending upon whether the associated antenna elements are respectively above or below the line 16. In both of these difference outputs 10 and 12 low side lobes are achieved by attenuating or weighting the individual signal amplitudes by an appropriate choice of resistor 17 or 18 depending on the distances of the individual elements from the respective centre lines 14 and 16 as well as from the centre of the array. The signals in the three IF outputs 10 12 can then be processed in three identical channels. Finally after separation in known manner by range gates the phase and amplitude of the signals in the difference channels are compared with phase and amplitude of the signal in the sum channel to determine the angular offset of targets in the horizontal and vertical directions. According to the present invention the circuit arrangement shown in figure 4 is used in co operation with the antenna array A and circuitry shown in Figure 2. The invention replaces the conventional rectangular cartesian co ordinate system by applying polar coordinate dependent phases to produce a polar monopulse radar system. As before the outputs 9 from the receivers 2 associated with each antenna element B in the array h are summed in a weighting network F, of resistors 19 21 of which only three are shown to produce a conventional sum signal at the output 22 from the network F1. The output 9 from each receiver 2, however, is also applied via a fixed polar phase delay 23 to a second weighting network F of resistors 24 26 to produce a signal weighted output difference signal 27 . The fixed polar phase delay 23 introduces a phase shift for each antenna element B equal to the angle e of the element measured in a clockwise sense from the array centre line 14.This is achieved by using appropriate lengths of cable to connect the receivers 2 to the network F4 The polar monopulse thus requires only two channels with two weighting networks F1 and F4 compared with the three networks required in the conventional Figure 3 arrangement.In addition, amplitude weighting in the F4 network of the difference channel depends only on the distance of the antenna element from the centre of the array ie there is circular symmetry for this channel as well as for the sum channel. The sum output 22 0 and the difference output 27 are then combined to determine the angular position of the target uniquely by taking the amplitude ratioakto give the angular offset of the target from the boresight direction, and the phase difference between the two outputs to give the radial direction of the target relative to the centre line 14. In a circular array of detectors a phase mole can be selected such that the phase of the individual elements varies linearly with their angular position, with total phase of 2m 3600, where n is an integer.It is then possible by suitably phased addition of the various modes to generate a beam or a null in particular directions in the plane of the array. This consideration is extended to a circular planar array in the present invention by considering what happens in planes normal to the array. Figure 5 indicates a typical antenna element 28 in a planar array located at an angle e from the array centre line 29 and a distance r from the centre 30 of the array. The amplitude of excitation of the array is a function of the radial distance r only and is represented by Amplitude f r If n 0, there is a constant phase over the face of the array and a beam is formed normal to it. For the sum 6 pattern n is therefore chosen to be zero. The cross section of the resulting beam is indicated by the pattern 31 in Figure 6 as a symmetrical beam centred on the boresight 32 normal to the plane of the array, through the array centre 30 .For the polar difference A beam n is chosen to be 1. In this case the amplitude excitation of the array as shown by the pattern 33 is symmetrical with a null 34 in the bore sight direction 32 surrounded by an annular peak 35, constant in amplitude, but with a 3600 change of phase around it. Thus, if a target is within the sum 2Q beam 31 the ratio of the amplitudes of the signal returns in the sum 31 and polar difference 33 beams indicates the angular distance cf the target off boresight. Com, parison of the phases of the two returns then indicates the radial direction of the target. It is also possible to choose integer values of n greater than 1. This gives higher angular resolution at the expense o ambiguity. Although not shown in Figure 6,for the purpose of simplicity,a uniform amplitude distribution in a difference pattern generally leads to high sidelobes as well as a lower monopulse angular sensitivity. In the usual rectangular coordinate monopulse system lower side lobes and greater angular sensitivity are obtained by applying a linear taper in amplitude proportional to the distance of the antenna element from the centre of the array. This is also true for the polar coordinate mpnopulse system. It can be shown in the latter case that this tapering results in a difference radiation pattern of circular symmetry with a cross section identical to that of the convetional difference pattern, though with a doubling of receiver noise. The side lobes can be further lowered by reducing the amplitude close to the edge of the array, but in this case the polar monopulse does not correspond exactly with the conventional difference pattern. With a uniform phase across the array as described above the sumbeam is aligned on the boresight ie along the array axis perpendicular to the plane of the array. In order to steer the beams to some other direction a uniform phase slope has to be applied across the face of the array. The uniform phase slope is applied in known manner by setting the phase delays in the phase shifters 4 so as to be linearly dependent on the positions of the respective detectors in the array. In the case ofthe polar difference beam the same phase slope must be added to the phase mode. The annular peak of the difference beam will remain undistorted in terms of sino whereoCis the angle from boresight , however in terms ofoC it will appear somewhat egg shaped. It may therefore be preferable to perform the calculation of the position of a target offset from the null in terms of sind space and then convert to actual angles. In general the phase shifts applied to the individual antenna elements will be quantised as for the conventional monopulse and this quantisation introduces an angular error. The angular error will also be increased by reducing the number of antenna elements as in conventional thinned arrays.It can be shown that the angular accuracy of the polar monopulse 59 independent of direction, and equal to that which the conventional monopulse achieves in directions at 450 to the centre line axis 14 of array. The polar difference beam of the present invention is more difficult to set up than the conventional monopulse since it involves radial amplitude and circumferential phase changes across the face of the array. By comparison each conventional monopulse difference beam involves amplitude changes in two dimensions but with a single phase reversal at the central axis. The polar monopise however requires only two channels instead of three for tracking. This gives a saving of one third in the cost of signal processing and in such auxiliaries as jamming cancellation loops. Apart from the example described above the invention is applicable to any detection system in which both the phase and amplitude of the individual elements is preserved. The combining networks can be at rf, if, or lf or alternatively digital signals including phase information can be combined in a computer. In a further modification the outputs from small groups or sub arrays of antenna elements can be combined as for the individual antenna elements, described. Further modifications within the scope of the invention described will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
