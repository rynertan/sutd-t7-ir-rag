# Method for preparing organo germanium propionic acid derivatives.

## Abstract
Germanium tetrachloride is reduced with hypophos phorous acid or its salt in hydrochloric acid, or lower alcohol, or lower alcoholic hydrochloric acid solution. The reaction mixture is then reacted with acrylic acid derivatives and further hydrolyzed to the desired organo germanium pro pionic acid derivatives.
