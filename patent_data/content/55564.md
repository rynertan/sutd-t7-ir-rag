# Read only semiconductor memory device and method of making it.

## Abstract
A read only memory semiconductor device in which a plurality of MIS type transistors 12 are arranged in a matrix with each one of the transistors corresponding to one bit of information and in which binary information is stored in accordance with whether each of the transistors has a normally on or a normally off characteristic. At least one of the source 25C and drain 26C region of the MIS transistor 12 having a normally on characteristic has a greater depth than the source 25A and B and drain 26A and B region of the MIS transistors having a normally off characteristic. Such semiconductor read only memory devices may be manufac tured by carrying out a selective ion implantation step on at least one of the source 25C and drain 26C regions of the MIS type transistors 12 to increase their impurity density in this region and thus form them with a greater depth. An alternative way of manufacturing such semiconductor read only memory devices is to direct a high energy beam at the at least one of the source 25C and drain 26C regions of the MIS type transistors 12 to have a normally on characteristic locally to heat the source 25C and or drain 26C regions of the transistors to cause greater diffusion of the impurities in these regions and hence form these regions with a greater depth.
