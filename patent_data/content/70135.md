# A numerical control method and an nc system.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a numerical control method for an NC system, and system itself, having means to execute a mirror image function as shown wherein the moving direction of a movable member is reversed with respect to a commanded direction for each control axis, and memory means to store coordinate values of a commanded position and coordinate values of a current machine position. This numerical control method comprises the step of storing the respective axial coordinate values of the current machine position at the time that the mirror image function has become effective, the step of calculating the commanded position coordinate values CP of directly preceding NC data after the mirror image function has become effective, by using the current machine position coordinate values and the position coordinate values at the time that the mirror image function has become effective, the step of calculating an incremental value CP
