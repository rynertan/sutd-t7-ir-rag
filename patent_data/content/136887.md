# OPTICAL FIBRE CABLE

## Abstract
An optical fibre cable employs a support member 12 fabricated from a plastics material which has embedded therein glass fibres. The support member has radially extending arms 15 which form compartments with the outer jacket 11 of the cable. The support member has a central aperture in which a strength member 20 is inserted. Due to the construction of the support member, it is possible to reduce substantially the diameter of the strength member so as to obtain a lower cost and more efficient cable.
