# Wheel slip control system.

## Abstract
A wheel slip control system particularly for use on a light railway vehicle such as a mass transit car. The outputs 2, 4 of a vehicle acceleration sensor 1 and a wheel acceleration sensor 3 are compared by a comparator 5 to detect onset of wheel slip, either skidding or spinning. The comparator output 6a, 6b is employed to modify the braking or tractive effect in a sense to eliminate the wheel slip, All braked and driven wheels or axles may be included in the systems and their respective braking tractive efforts modified as necessary to balance the acceleration and braking of the vehicle by making maximum use of available adhesion.
