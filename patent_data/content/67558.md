# Method of producing bearing component and bearing comprising the bearing component.

## Abstract
A method of producing a bearing component for a bearing having an inner ring 2 , an outer ring 1 and rolling elements 3 having a solid lubricant on a frictional surface part thereof, which consists in forming a coating layer 6 , 7 of a material on a frictional surface part of a metal substrate, the solubilities of the coating material in the substrate metal and in the solid lubricant being higher than the mutual solubility of the substrate metal and the solid lubricant, forming on a surface part of the coating layer 6 , 7 a solid lubricant layer 8 consisting of a metallic material having a low solubility in the substrate metal, and maintaining the solid lubricant layer 8 , the coating layer 6 , 7 and the metal substrate for a predetermined period of time at a predeter mined temperature of below the lower one of the maximum operating temperature of the bearing component and the melting point of the solid lubricant so as to induce mutual diffusion between the metal substrate, the coating and the solid lubricant, thereby increasing the bonding strength between them.
