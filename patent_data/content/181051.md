# TELEPHONE APPARATUS WITH SPEAKER AMPLIFIER

## Abstract
A telephone station instrument can be used with either a two wire or a four wire point to point circuit. The instrument is provided with a handset and also with an internal loud speaker and amplifier. The amplifier is provided with a manual cut off switch disposed on a front panel of the instrument housing, and a light or LED indicating whether the speaker is on or off. An incoming signaling LED, a hookswitch actuator, a signal key, and a voice actuated lamp or LED are also disposed on a front panel of the housing. The housing of the instrument is generally rectangular in shape to facilitate stacking of several of these instruments one atop the other.
