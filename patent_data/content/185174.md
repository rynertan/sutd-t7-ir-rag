# Sludge trap with internal baffles for use in nuclear steam generator.

## Abstract
A sludge trap for use in nuclear steam generators includes internal baffles defining multiple laminar flow paths having small vertical settling distances. The baffling arrange ments take advantage of the diverging nature of circular geometry of sludge traps such that flow path cross sectional areas are maintained and increased in the direction of flow, to avoid undesired, detrimental flow acceleration turbu lence as well is minimized, thereby to achieve a desired quiescent environment for effective gravitational settlement of sediment and particulate matter.
