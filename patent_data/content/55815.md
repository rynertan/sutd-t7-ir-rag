# Method and furnace for refining of magnesium.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method and a furnace for continuous refining of molten magnesium. Raw magnesium is charged into a precipitation chamber in the refining furnace beneath the metal surface as a stream directed to a beneath laying salt layer. The precipitated sludge is directed along a sloped bottom in the chamber to an adjacent accumulating chamber. Magnesium rises in the precipitation chamber and through openings in partition walls between precipitation chambers is always the purest magnesium from upper metal layer expelled to a lower level in next chamber in the process direction. The refining furnace comprises an accumulating cham ber 5 for sludge and plurality of successive arranged precipitation chambers 6, 7, 8, and 9 divided from each other by vertical walls 4 . The openings 12 in partition walls between precipitation chambers are designed as skewed channels with inlet 13 at a higher level than the outlet 14 in the following chamber.
