# METHOD OF MANUFACTURING A SELF DRILLING SCREW.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a drill shaped cutting tool which is used to roll a workpiece, such as a wire rod by a rolling die and a rolling die used for this purpose. This rolling die 201 is provided at at least a portion of a substantially columnar trunk section 101 the diameter of which is almost equal to that of a drill portion of a drill shaped cutting tool to be manufactured, with a plurality of drill portion forming grooves and ridges 207 , 208 , which are formed by discharging a discharge processing electrode 106 while turning the same in parallel with a rolling die 201 , which electrode 106 has a discharge portion formed in to substantially the shape of a drill by making grooves and ridges in and on the outer surface thereof.
