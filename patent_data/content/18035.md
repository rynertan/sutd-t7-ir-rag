# Process for producing alumina.

## Abstract
Alumina is produced by the hydrolysis of aluminum alkoxide in a continuous process in which the hydrolysis reaction, the aging of hydrated alumina product and the stripping of occluded by product alcohol from the alumina particles is accomplished in the same reaction vessel by bubbling steam through said vessel.
