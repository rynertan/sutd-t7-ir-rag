The penicillin or cephalosporin is generally utilised in its conventionally administered amount. The compounds of the formula I wherein A is aCH CH2 CH3 group and salts and esters thereof may be prepared by the reduction of the corresponding compound of the formula I wherein A is a C CH CH3 group. Accordingly, this invention provides a process for the preparation of the compounds of the formula I wherein A is a CH CH2 CH3 group or a salt or cleavable ester thereof, which process comprises the reduction of a compound of the formula I wherein A is a C CH CH3 group or a salt or cleavable ester thereof and thereafter, if desired, de esterifying the esterified carboxyl group. The reduction is generally performed on an ester of the ethylidene compound of the formula I . The reduction may be effected by hydrogenation in the presence of a noble metal catalyst, such as palladium or platinum oxide. The preferred catalyst is platinum oxide. A low, medium or high pressure of hydrogen may be used, and we have found it convenient to use an approximately atmospheric pressure of hydrogen. Suitable solvents for the hydrogenation reaction include tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate and the like, or mixtures thereof, optionally in admixture with water. The hydrogenation reaction leads predominantly to the ethyl compound of the formula I having the cis configuration about the lactam ring for example, the compounds of the formulae II and IV with only a minor proportion of the trans isomer. The desired compound may be obtained from the reaction mixture by evaporation of the filtered reaction mixture in vacuo. The initial product may be further purified chromatographically, for example, over silica using cyclohexane ethyl acetate or the like as eluant. The reduction of an ethylidene compound of the formula I may also be effected using a borohydride. Sodium borohydride has proved to be particularly convenient in this process. The reaction is normally effected at a slightly depressed temperature, such as from 10 to 10 C, in a solvent such as ethanol pyridine or aqueous tetrahydrofuran. The borohydride reduction leads to the formation of the ethyl compound of the formula I having predominantly the trans configuration about the ss lactam ring for example, the compounds of the formulae III and V with only a minor proportion of the cis isomer. The required product may be obtained from the reaction mixture in conventional manner, for example, by adding ethyl acetate, washing with water, and evaporating the organic layer. The product may be further purified if desired, for example, by chromatography on silica, eluting with ethyl acetate and or petroleum ether or the like. The cis ethyl compounds of the formula I may be separated from any small amounts of the trans isomers or vice versa by repeated chromatography. The required compounds may be distinguished by their nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. The 5 CH 6 CH proton coupling constants are of the order of 2 3 Hz in the trans compounds, and 4 6 Hz in the cis compounds. Alternatively, the individual isomers may be identified by structure determination techniques such as X ray crystallography. If the compound of the formula I per se or a salt thereof is required it may be prepared from a hydrogenolysable or hydrolysable ester by mild hydrogenation or mild hydrolysis. In general, it is preferred to hydrogenate a p nitrobenzyl ester in order to produce the parent acid or its salt. Such hydrogenation is conveniently effected using an atmospheric pressure of hydrogen and a palladium on charcoal catalyst. Suitable solvents include aqueous dioxane and other similar solvents. If a salt is required, this may be generated in conventional manner by the addition of the desired amount of a base, for example an aqueous solution of a bicarbonate, bicarbonate or the like. The desired product may be obtained by evaporation of the solvents. The salts of a compound of the formula I may be purified by chromatography, for example over a gelfiltration agent such as Biogel P2 Biogel P2 is a registered trade mark which refers to a polyacrylamide gel supplied by Biorad . Suitable solvents for use include water, aqueous lower aikanols such as aqueous metnanol, aqueous ethanol or te like. ,This invention further provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I or a salt thereof which process comprises the electrolysis of a corresponding ester, wherein the esterified carboxyl group is a group of the sub formula f as hereinbefore defined or a p nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl group. Preferably, the electrolysis is carried out on a p methoxycarbonylbenzyl ester. The electrolysis will be effected using standard conditions, for example, in an inert aprotic solvent, using mercury, lead, platinum or carbon as the cathode and lead, platinum or carbon as the anode, and using a tetra alkylammonium halide or tetrafluoroborate as electrolyte. We have found it particularly convenient to carry out the electrolysis in the cathodic compartment of a divided cell with a mercury pool electrode using DMF as solvent, 0y1M tetrabutylammonium iodide or tetrafluoroborate as electrolyte, in the presence of acetic acid to quench any radical anions formed in the electrolysis, at a potential of about 1 9v relative to the standard calomel electrode for cleavage of p methoxycarbonylbenzyl esters, or about 1 3v for p nitrobenzyl esters. The product of the electrolysis reaction may be recovered in conventional manner, for example by converting the compound to the sodium salt using an ion exchange resin e.g. Amberlite IR 120, Na form and further purifying the salt by, for example, gel chromatography on a material such as Biogel P 2.Alternatively, the product of the electrolysis may be adsorbed on a resin such as Amberlite IRA 458, then eluted with sodium chloride solution, the eluate being de salted to provide a solution of the sodium salt of the compound of the formula I . The salt of the compound of the formula I may be obtained in solid form by removing the solvent for example, by freezedrying or spray drying or by solvent precipitation. This invention also provides processes for the preparation of a compound of the formula I as hereinbefore defined wherein A is C CH.CH3 or a salt or cleavable ester thereof which processes comprise either a the elimination of the elements of a compound of the formula XV R7 O n SO3 H XV wherein R is a lower alkyl, aryl or lower aralkyl group and n is O or R7 is a lower alkyl, aryl or lower aralkyi group or a cation and n is 1, from a compound of the formula XVI EMI16.1 wherein X is as defined in relation to formula I C02R1 is a cleavable ester group and R7 and n are as defined in relation to formula XV . The elimination of the elements of a compound of the formula ZV is most conveniently brought about b treatment of a compound of the formula XVI with a base in an aprotic medium. The base employed will be a base of low nucleophilicity so that in general primary and secondary amines will not be suitable. Suitable bases include powdered inorganic bases such as alkali metal carbonates, bicarbonates or hydroxides, for example powdered potassium carbonate. irid r 1,2 dioxahicyclo 5.4.0 under 5 ene. table solvents for use in this reaction in formamide, hexamithiophosphoramide, dichlormethane tetrahydrofuran and the like. The elimination may be effected at a non extrere temperature such as 20 700C, for example 10 to 2500. The reaction may be conveniently effected at ambient temperature. Elimination of a compound of the formula XV from an ester of a trans compound of the formula XVI leads to the preparation of a Z or EZ isomer of the ethylidene compound whereas elimination from an ester of a ciscompound of the formula XVI leads to the preparation of the corresponding E or Z isomer. The desired product may be obtained from the reaction mixture by concentrating in vacuo, diluting with a water immiscible organic solvent such as ethyl acetate, and removing impurities by washing with water.The organic layer may be re evaporated in vacuo to yield the compound of the formula VIII or IX or a mixture thereof. These compounds may then be purified and or separated chromatographically if desired, for example on silica gel using ethyl acetate, petroleum ether, chloroform, ethanol or the like or mixtures thereof as eluant.Or b the elimination of the elements of water from a compound of the formula XVII EMI17.1 wherein Y H CU CH3 is as defined in relation to formula I and C02R1 is a cleavable ester group, in the presence of a compound of the formula XVIII R8O2C N N CO2R9 XVIII wherein R8 and R9 are independently lower alkyl, aryl or lower alkyl aryl, and a compound of the formula XIX EMI18.1 wherein a, b and c are independently 0 or 1, and R10,R11 and R12 are independently lower alkyl, aryl or lower alkyl aryl.In the compounds of the formula XVIII R8 and Rg are preferably selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, phenyl and benzyl, the ethyl and t butyl groups being preferred. It is often convenient that R8 and R9 represent the same group. Preferred compounds of the formula XIX include triarylphosphines and tralkylphosph es. Preferred groups R10, R11 and R12 include methyl, ethyl, n propyl, n butyl, benzyl, phenyl and methoxyphenyl. Conveniently,R10, R11 and R12 represent the same group. A particularly preferred compound of the formula XIX is triphenyl phosphine. Generally, approximately two equivalents of the compounds of the formulae XVII , XVIII and XIX are used per mole of compound xvII . The elimination reaction is generally carried out at a non extreme temperature, such as 20 to 10000. We have found it convenient to begin the reaction at a depressed temperature, such as OOC, and then to allow the temperature to rise to about room temperature. The reaction is performed in an inert aprotic organic solvent. Suitable solvents include tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethyl acetate, benzene and the like. Once the reaction is complete, the product may be obtained by washing with water, evaporation of the solvent and chromatography as hereinbefore described. The compounds of the formula XVI wherein n isO may be prepared by the reaction of a compound of the formula XVII with a compound of the formula XX S02 C1 E or the chemical equivalent thereof wherein R7 is as defined in relation to formula XVI . Suitable chemical equivalents of the compounds of the formula XX include the corresponding bromide, anhydride and the like. In general, the reaction is performed in the presence of an acid acceptor to take up the acid generated by the reaction. Suitable acid acceptors include tertiary amines such as triethylamine and the like and powdered solid inorganic bases such as potassium carbonate or the like. The reaction is normally carried out in a nonhydroxylic medium such as a halohydrocarbon such as dichloromethane or the like at a depressed temperature such as 200 to 1000, for example 100 to OOC. A When the reaction is over, the desired product may be obtained by washing the organic phase to remove water soluble impurities and then evaporating the dried organic phase. The product may be further purified chromatographically if desired. The di esters within formula XVI wherein n is 1 may be prepared by the esterification of a salt of the formula XXI EMI20.1 wherein Y NH CO CH3 and R1 are as defined in relation to formulae VIII and IX and M is a cation. Conveniently, tS is an alkali metal ion, such as a sodium ion, or a quaternary ammonium ion. The esterification is generally carried out using a powerful esterifying agent such as a compound of the formula XXIII R7 30 BF4 XXII in a non hydroxylic solvent, such as dichloromethane. Compounds I where Y is a cis SCH CH group may be prepared by the isomerisation of a corresponding compound wherein Y is a trans S CH CH group by con tac t ing the compound with a mercuric sal in the presence of an inert solvent. Suitable mercuric salts include the chloride, bromide, iodide, sulphate and acetate. Suitable solvents include acetonitrile, acetone, dichloromethane, chloroform and water. The reaction is generally carried out at a moderate temperature, such as 30 to 5000, room temperature being convenient.
