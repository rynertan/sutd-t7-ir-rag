## Description
METHOD FOR FORMING PATTERNED RESIST LAYER ON SEMICONDUCTOR BODY This invention relates to a method for forming a patterned resist layer on a semiconductor body. The invention allay be applicable to a process for the processing of negative working resists suitable for lithography using an energy radiation or ray, especially, an electron beam, X rays or an ion beam. Such method comprises a step of heating a layer of negative working resist on a semiconductor body in an atmosphere which is free from any oxidizing gases, after exposure to an energy radiation and before development. It is particularly useful in the manufacture of semiconductor devices. Electron beam exposure system has been found to be useful in providing controlled line exposure of submicron dimensions. Such dimensions, accompanied by strict tolerances, are essential to the production of integrated circuit chips. The procedure for such production is to expose a resist layer applied to a suitable substrate or base material, usually a semiconductor, to an electron beam having a width of submicron dimensions. After the resist is developed, the substrate not protected by the resist is etched, either by a chemical solution or by a plasma beam. As is well known in the art, a variety of negativeworking resists are useful for recording an electron beam in the electron beam exposure devices. This is because they possess high sensitivity to an electron beam of conventional voltage and also have submicron resolution capability, thermal stability, and high resistance to etching.After electron beam exposure, the negative resists are cross linked in the exposed area through a formation of free radicals and become insoluble in the developer used in the subsequent developing step. During development, the unexposed area of the resists is dissolved in the developer and, therefore, a negative image or resist pattern corresponding to the pattern of the electron beam exposure is formed on the substrate. It has been found that iii i any or substantially all of the negative working resists for electron beam exposure, such as poly glycidyl methacrylate PGMA , poly glycidyl methacrylate co ethyl acrylate P GMA co EA , and poly diallyl orthophthalate PDOP further cross linking occurs after the electron beam exposure while still in the electron beam exposure device. The additional cross linking reaction of the negative resists after the electron beam exposure is known in the art as post polymerization and is considered to be caused by the radicals remaining in the resists after completion of the electron beam exposure. The post polymerization in the exposed area of the resists results in undesirable variation of the width and thickness of the resulting resist patterns. The post polymerization of the electron beam exposed negative working resists is particularly prone to occur in the device chips or parts of resist coated wafers, namely, semiconductor substrates. Resist coated wafers comprise a plurality of device chips. The first chip exposed is contained in the electron beam exposure device, and therefore maintained under cross linking conditions, until the electron beam exposure of the last chip of the wafer is completed. The last chip exposed does not exhibit any, or in any case less, post polymerization, because the wafer is removed from the exposure device immediately after the completion of exposure of that last chip.The post polymerization of the resists clearly depends on the residence time in the electron beam exposure device after electron beam exposure, and therefore decreases from the first to last electron beam exposure steps. Actual wafers show relatively wide and thick resist patterns formed on the first chip exposed, and relatively narrow and thin resist patterns formed on the last chip exposed. Further, the percentage residual coating increases along with the increased residence time of the exposed resists in the exposure device. The term percentage residual coating used herein means the percentage of the thickness of the coated resist left after electron beam exposure and developing residual resist coating , based on the initial thickness of the coated resists. To solve the problem of the variation of width and thickness, it has heretofore been proposed to further maintain the electron beam exposed negative resists in a curing chamber appended to the electron beam exposure device, before developing, in order to intentionally cause a further cross linking reaction of the exposed and thus cross linked resists. The curing chamber must be in vacuum or filled with a non oxidizing atmosphere such as nitrogen gas. This proposal is based on the fact that further or additional cross linking of the resists in the curing chamber makes variations of the post polymerization of the resists in the exposure device negligible and thus is effective for attaining a predetermined percentage residual coating. One difficulty with the above procedure is that the curing time is relatively long, generally, about three to five times the electron beam exposure time. This means that, to maintain the same speed of processing as without this additional step, three to five wafers must be processed in the curing chamber at once. This procedure is technically troublesome. It is desirable to provide a process for the processing of negative working resists for energy radiation exposure which ensures a high dimensional accuracy of the resulting resist patterns and a constant thickness of the resist coating remaining on the exposed area, and provides a high percentage residual coating, while still allowing , curing of the energy radiation exposed resists to be carried out in a relatively short time. It is also deisrable to allowstraight line processing of the resists. According to the present invention there is provided a a etind for forming a patterned resist layer on a semiconductor body, wherein a layer of negative working resist on the semiconductor body is heated in an atmosphere which is free from any oxidizing gases, after an energy radiation was projected to a desired region of said resist layer, so that post polymerization of said negative working resist is substantially accomplished and then the exposed and post polymerized negative working resist is developed. In an embodiment of this invention, the layer of negative working resist may be heated in a vacuum. In another preferred embodiment of this invention, the atmosphere in which the resist layer is heated after exposure and before development may comprise a nitrogen gas. In a still another embodiment of this invention, the heating may be carried out at a temperature higher than room temperature and lower than 1000C. The term energy radiation used herein is intended to include any energy radiations or rays which are conventionally used in the art, such as an electron beam, X rays or an ion beam. It is therefore to be noted that while this invention is described hereinafter with regard to exposure with an electron beam, it is also useful for exposure to other forms of energy radiation, such as X rays or an ion beam. Reference will now be made, by way of example,to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic drawing of am electron beam exposure device for carrying out a method embodying the present invention Fig. 2 shows a modification of the curing chamber shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 shows another modification of the curing chamber shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 4 is a graph of percentage residual coating versus exposure dose, with increase of curing time, for a prior art method Fig. 5 is a graph showing the temperature dependence of percentage residual coating and finally curing effects in an embodiment Of this invention and Fig. 6 is a graph showing the relation between curing time and percentage residual coating at different curing temperatures in an embodiment of this invention. In an aixdiment of this invention, it is desirable that the electron beam exposed negative working resists be heated at an elevated temperature, without exposure to air in the atmosphere, immediately after the electron beam exposure and before development. In an embodiment of this invention post polymerization or cross linking reaction of the resists caused in an electron beam exposure step is intentionally extended through heating at a high temperature beyond room temperature. The extended cross linking reaction of the resists is still very short, however, compared with some prior art methods. In order to maintain the electron beam exposed resists under air tight conditions, it is proposed to apply a relatively weak vacuum to a curing chamber connected to the electron beam exposure device or introduce into the curing chamber a non oxidizing gas to reduce the oxygen concentration in the curing chamber to 1 or less. Examples of nonoxidizing gases useful in the practice of this invention include nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, methane, rare gases such as argon and helium, and mixtures thereof.Nitrogen is particularly useful for the purpose of this invention. As described above, the electron beam exposed resists have to be heated in the curing chamber at a high temperature beyond room temperature about 20 to 300C . It has been found that heating should be made preferably in the temperature of more than room temperature and lower than 1000C, most preferably, about 300C to about 50 C. Temperatures higher than about 1000C should be avoided since they cause an undesirable thermal cross linking of the resists, thereby resulting in decreased definition of the resist patterns. It is to be noted that the thermal cross linking is distinguished from the cross linking intended in the method of this invention. Heating can be carried out by means of any conventional heating means well known in the art. Representative heating means useful in this invention include convection heaters, microwave heaters, and infrared lamp heaters. The use of ultraviolet lamps should be avoided, since some types of negative working resists are sensitive to ultraviolet radiation. If a non oxidizing atmosphere is used instead of a vacuum, heating may also be carried out by circulating heated non oxidizing gases in the curing chamber. Embodiments of the invention can be used for many conventional negative working resists for electron beam exposure which are well known in the art The invention is preferrably used for PGMA, P GMA co EA , and PDOP, set forth above, copolymers of allylmaleate CAM , crosslinking electron resists CER , and copolymers of maleic anhydride and fluoroalkylvinyl ether CMF . It is desirable in embodiments of this invent on that the electron beam exposed negative resists be maintained in vacuum or in a non oxidizing atmosphere. If the exposed resists are exposed, before curing, to the air in the atmosphere even for a moment, it is difficult to attain the desired further cross linking. To better understand the invention, a process of formation of a negative resist pattern on a substrate and etching of the substrate, is described below. First, a solution of a selected polymer useful as a negative working resist for electron beam exposure is prepared as a resist. Preferred solvents include 2 methoxyethyl acetate, 2 ethoxyethyl acetate, 2 ethoxy ethanol, 2 butanone and mixtures of these with 2 propanol or ethanol. The resist is then coated on a substrate by spin coating, brushing, roll coating, doctor blade coating, or the like. Any suitable substrate may be used. Particularly preferred substrates include semiconductors such as silicon wafers. Before the coating, the substrate is preliminarily washed to improve the adhesive property of the resist thereon. The resist is then pre baked. This is conveniently accomplished by baking in an oven, optionally in a vacuum, for example, at 900C for 20 minutes. This step is effective to completely remove the solvent remaining in the resist coating. After prebaking, the resist is imagewise exposed to an electron beam. The exposure procedures used are well known and no discussion concerning the electron beam exposure devices and the operation conditions is necessary. the resist is cured using a method embodying the invention, then developed to remove the unexposed areas. The development can be carried out with same solvents as set forth above. After development, the negative image or resist pattern is finally formed on the substrate. The formed image or pattern possesses a high dimensional accuracy and a constant thickness of the resist coating remaining in the exposed areas, in addition to thermal stability and high resistance to etching. Optionally, a post bake step is included after the electron beam exposure and development to enhance adhesion of the final resist coating to the areas to be protected, prior to etching. Etching of the underlying substrate is achieved by application of a chemical solvent or plasma gas to the substrate. The etched substrate can be effectively used to produce semiconductor devices and the like after subsequent processing. figure 1 shows one example of an electron beam exposure device for carrying out a process embodying the invention. Exposure device 1 comprises exposure chamber 2, intermediate chamber 3, and curing chamber 4. Gates 7 and 8 connect intermediate chamber 3 with exposure chamber 2 and curing chamber 4. Gate 9 connects curing chamber 4 with the outside. Curing chamber 4 has gas inlet 10 and gas outlet 11. Reference numerals 5 refer to a moving stage. Stage 5 carries specimen 6 thereon. Specimen 6 is a semiconductor wafer and comprises a substrate having coated thereon a negative working resist for electron beam exposure. The resist coating not shown of specimen 6 is imagewise exposed to an electron beam, shown by the vertical dotted line, in electron beam exposure chamber 2. After exposure, specimen 6 is conveyed on stage 5 through gate 7 to intermediate chamber 3, which has been previously controlled to a vacuum. Gate 7 immediately closes and nitrogen or another non oxidizing gas is introduced to intermediate chamber 3, raising it to a certain pressure. At the same time, nitrogen gas heated to a predetermined temperature, for example, about 50 C, is being circulated from gas inlet 10 to gas outlet 11 to fill curing chamber 4 with a free flow of hot gas. Specimen 6 is conveyed chamber 3 through gate 8 to curing chamber 4, where it undergoes curing or further cross linking of the resists, then is removed through gate 9. Figure 2 shows a modification of the curing chamber ofFig. I. The modification consists of the provision of a heating means, convection heater 12, which allows unheated nitrogen gas to be introduced into curing chamber 4. Figure 3 shows still another modification of tuhe curing chamber of Fig. 1. The modification consists of the rotor 13 used to control the pressure of the curing chamber to a moderate vacuum. Thus, unlike the chambers of Figs. 1 and 2, no gas is introduced therein and, therefore, no gas inlets or outlets are necessary. For heating, infrared lamps 14 are used. Since curing chamber 4 is maintained under vacuum conditions, no gas need either be introduced into the adjacent intermediate chamber in the previous step. Figure 4 is a graph of the prior art and shows the curing time and exposure dose dependence of percentage residual coating and finally curing effects. The exposure does is given on a logarithmic scale. In order to ascertain the above dependence, the negative resist PDOP Mw about 10,000 was coated on the silicon substrate in the thickness of 1.70 pm, pre baked at 900C for 20 minutes, exposed to an electron beam at different exposure doses, and cured in a nitrogen atmosphere at 23.50C for different curing times, namely, 0 min. Curve A , 3 min. Curve B , 10 min. Curve C , and 30 min. Curve D . As the graph shows, percentage residual coating was increased with increase of exposure dose and with increase of curing time. The curing time of the first chip exposed is naturally different from that of the last chip exposed. This fact means that different curing times of the exposed chip of the wafer cause a variation of the percentage residual coating as well as a variation of the width and thickness of the resulting resist patterns. However, as is clear from Fig. 4, difference of the percentage residual coating between the first chip and the last chip can be minimized with the extention of the curing time. This is the reason why the prior method needs very long curing time, generally, about three to five times the exposure time. Figure 5 is a graph showing the curing time dependence of percentage residual coating and finally curing effects in an embodiment of the invention.The exposure dose is given on a logarithmic scale, as in Fig. 4. In order to ascertain the above dependence, the procedure of Fig. 4 was repeated except that curing was made at different temperatures 23.50C, 300C and 600C for ten 10 minutes. Curve E shows a resist cured at 23.50C for 10 minutes, curve F at 300C for 10 minutes, and curve G at 600C for 10 minutes. As the graph shows, percentage residual coating was increased with increase of curing temperature. Further, dotted curve H is a contrast and shows a resist cured at 23.50C for 30 minutes. Comparison of this curve with the other curves E, F and G indicates that heating of the exposed negative resist in the curing chamber in accordance with the present inventionwcan be nore effective than the extension of the curing time in view of achieving an enhanced percentage residual coating. Furthermore, similar results were obtained when moderate vacuum was applied to the curing chamber in place of a nitrogen atmosphere. The curing effects of the method described may be seen from the graph of Fig. 6 in which the relation between curing time and percentage residual coating at different curing temperatures is shown. The graph indicates the results of curing with PDOP Mw about 10,000 exposed to an w 2 electron beam at an exposure dose of about 1.2 x 10 C cm . Lines I, J and K indicate the case of a curing temperature of about 23.50C, 300C and 600C, respectively. The curing time is given on a logarithmic scale. As apparent, the percentage residual coating increased along with the increased time after exposure, namely, the curing time. Further, the percentage residual coating per unit time increase with elevation of the temperature of the specimen in the curing chamber, namely, the curing temperature. For example, a curing time of only about 10 minutes is needed to attain a percentage residual coating of 72 at a curing temperature of about 3 00C, while a curing time of about 60 minutes is needed at a curing temperature of 23.50C. It is believed that since post polymerization of the resist is a kind of chemical reaction, a higher temperature increases the polymerization velocity. A higher curing temperature therefore accelerates the post polymerization effect of the resist. As can be understood from the above description, a reaction velocity of the post polymerization is accelerated with elevation of the temperature. Therefore, if a curing temperature is elevated, a curing time can be shortened. Thus a method embodying the present invention can use a curing time which is equal to or less than the exposure time, while a prior method can need a curing time which is 3 to 5 times the exposure time, in order to minimize differences in the percentage residual coating and pattern size of the resulting resist patterns. Further, the method described can be applicable not only to electronbeam exposure, but also toX ray exposure in which exposure is carried out by means of a step and repeat system in a non oxidizing atmosphere including vacuum , and ion beam exposure.
