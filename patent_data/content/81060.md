# NOISE SUPPRESSING FILTER HAVING A PLURALITY OF CAPACITORS WITHIN A SINGLE COIL

## Abstract
A capacitive filter of the single coil type comprises a continuous metallic layer and a discontinuous metallic layer separated from one another by a dielectric layer and forming a plurality of capacitors having at least one common plate. The opposing plates of said capacitors are formed by respective portions of said discontinuous metallic layer and are each provided with a terminal projecting from one end face of the coil. In order to avoid the occurrence of parasitic inductances in the windings of the continuous metallic layer, the invention provides that at least a certain number of the windings of said continuous metallic layer projects from the opposite end face of the coil, the projecting portions of said windings being interconnected by a short circuiting member.
