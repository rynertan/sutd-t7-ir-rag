# Liquid measuring devices.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a method and apparatus for measuring flow and or volume of a liquid preferably milk in which the milk is passed from a passageway 2, 3 through a gap 5 which is long vertically but narrow in width so that a pool is formed in the upstream part 2 of the passageway, the height of milk in the pool being a measure of the rate of flow of the milk. The levels maintained over predetermined intervals of time are integrated to give volume measurements. Measure ments of levels are made by providing a resistor 6, 7, 8 in the passageway so that the impedance is changed according to the liquid level and measuring such impedance.
