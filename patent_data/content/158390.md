# DC AC converter for igniting and feeding a gas and or vapour discharge lamp.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a DC AC converter 8 , having a half bridge circuit and which serves for igniting and feeding a gas and or vapour discharge tube 1 . According to the invention, a starting capacitor 94 of this converter is connected between a junction A between two branches each comprising a semi conductor circuit element 60 and 61, respectively of the half bridge circuit on the one hand and a centre tapping E of a voltage divider 90, 91 on the other hand. As a result, the converter 8 starts satisfactorily and hence the discharge tube 1 readily ignites, while moreover undesired starting pulses during the operat ing condition are avoided.
