## Description
Herbicidal Method This invention concerns herbicidal compositions and a herbicidal method. In one aspect, this invention provides a herbicidal composition which comprises a fluroxypyr i.e. 4 amino 3,5 dichloro 6 fluoro 2 pyridinyl oxyacetic acid or a salt or ester thereof , and b ethofumesate i.e. 2 ethoxy 2,3 dihydro 3,3 dimethyl benzofuran 5 yl methanesuiphonate , in association with a suitable carrier and or surface active agent. In another aspect, the invention provides a method of combatting weeds, which comprises applying to a locus infested or liable to be infested therewith, an effective amount of the two components a and b . Each of the components a and b is known separately to be herbicidally active, but we have found that the combination of a and b is surprisingly advantageous. The combination of a and b is synergistic. Component a is preferably employed as the free acid, an alkali metal e.g. sodium or potassium or alkanolamine e.g.ethanolamine salt, or a C1 10 alkyl e.g. methyl, ethyl, l methylheptyl or iso octyl ester From the point of view of compatibility of the active components, component a is preferably an ester, especially the l methylheptyl ester. The ratio by weight of a b is preferably 1 50 to 1 1, desirably 1 40 to 1 2.5. The components a and b may be applied sequentially to the locus if desired, but they are preferably applied as a composition comprising both. The present compounds are normally employed in the form of compositions containing a surface active agent and or a carrier. The compositions will normally be produced initially containing from 0.5 to 99 , preferably from 0.5 to 85 , and more usually from 10 to 50 by weight of the present compounds, which are diluted if necessary before application to the locus to be treated such that the concentration of active ingredient in the formulation applied is from 0.05 to 5 by weight. The carrier may be water, in which case an organic solvent may also be present, though this is not usually employed. A flowable suspension concentrate may be formed by grinding the compound with water, a wetting agent and a suspending agent, e.g. xanthan gum. The carrier may alternatively be a water immiscible organic solvent, e.g. a hydrocarbon which boils within the range 130 2700C, e.g xylene, in which the compound is dissolved or suspended. An emulsifiable concentrate containing a water immiscible solvent may be formed with a surface active agent so that the concentrate acts as a self emulsifiable oil on admixture with water. The carrier may alternatively be a water miscible organic solvent e.g. 2 methoxy ethanol, methanol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, formamide or methylformamide. The carrier may alternatively be a solid, which may be finely divided or granular. Examples of suitable solids are limestone, clays, sand, mica, chalk, attapulgite, diatomite, perlite, sepiolite, silicas, silicates, lignosulphonates and solid fertilizers. The carrier can be of natural or synthetic origin or can be modified natural material. Wettable powders soluble or dispersible in water may be formed by admixing the compound in particulate form with a particulate carrier or spraying molten compound on to the particulate carrier, admixing a wetting agent and a dispersing agent and finely grinding the whole powder mixture. An aerosol composition may be formed by admixing the compound with a propellant, e.g. a polyhalogenated alkane such as dichlorofluoromethane, and suitably also with a solvent. The term surface active agent is used in the broad sense to include materials variously called emulsifying agents, dispersing agents and wetting agents. Such agents are well known in the art. The surface active agents used may comprise anionic surface active agents, for example mono or di esters of phosphoric acid with a fatty alcohol ethoxylate, or salts of such esters, fatty alcohol sulphates such as sodium dodecyl sulphate, ethoxylated fatty alcohol sulphates, ethoxylated alkylphenol sulphates, lignin sulphates, petroleum sulphonates, alkylaryl sulphonates such as alkyl benzene sulphonates or lower alkylnapthalene sulphonates, salts of sulphonated napthaleneformaldehyde condensates, salts of sulphonated phenolformaldehyde condensates, or more complex sulphonates such as the amide sulphonates, e.g. the sulphonated condensation product of oleic acid and N methyl taurine or the dialkyl sulphosuccinates e.g. the sodium sulphonate of dioctyl succinate. The surface active agents may also comprise non ionic agents, for example condensation products of fatty acid esters1 fatty alcohols, fatty acid amides or alkyl substituted phenols with ethylene oxide, fatty esters of polyhydric alcohol ethers e.g. sorbitan fatty acid esters, condensation products of such esters with ethylene oxide e.g. polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, acetylenic glycols such as 2,4,7,9 tetramethyl 5decyn 4,7 diol, or ethoxylated acetylenic glycols. The surface active agents may also comprise cationic agents, for example alkyl and or aryl substituted quaternary ammonium compounds such as cetyl trimethylammonium bromide, or ethoxylated tertiary fatty amines. Preferred surface active agents include ethoxylated fatty alcohol sulphates, lignin sulphonates, alkyl aryl sulphonates, salts of sulphonated napthaleneformaldehyde condensates, salts of sulphonated phenolformaldehyde condensates, sodium oleoyl N methyltauride, dialkyl sulphosuccinates, alkyl phenol ethoxylates, and fatty alkyl ethoxylates. If the components a and b are applied sequentially they may each be applied in a composition analogous to those described above. If desired, the compositions may contain one or more further pesticides, e.g. herbicides, fungicides or insecticides in addition to components a and b . Especially preferred further herbicides include clopyralid, benazolin, ioxynil, bromoxynil, and phenoxyaliphatic acids, particularly mecoprop, dichlorprop, MCPA and 2,4 D. The present method and compositions are highly effective for the selective control of broad leaf weeds in crops. Amongst the weeds which are combated are Galium, Stellaria, Lamium, Galeopsis, Polygonum, Matricaria, Poa, Alopercurus,Hordeum, Bromus, Avena, Holcus, Brassica, Sinapis, Veronica, Trifolium and Chenopodium spp. Crops in which the present method and compositions may be employed include grass crops such as ryegrass perennial, westerwold or Italian particularly , cocksfoot, meadow fescue, tall fescue and timothy. In the present method, usually 0.25 5, preferably 1 3 kg in total of a and b are applied per hectare. The amount of a applied is preferably 0.01 to 0.5 kg ha, and the amount of b applied is preferably 0.5 to 4 kg ha. The composition comprising a and b is preferably applied post emergence of the weeds. The following Example is now given, though only by way of illustration Example Seeds of the following plant species were sown in pots in the glasshouse, and immediately after emergence were sprayed with the treatments listed below in 200 litres hectare to give the stated rates of application. Three pots were sprayed with each treatment. In the tests the l methylheptyl ester of fluroxypyr was employed.
