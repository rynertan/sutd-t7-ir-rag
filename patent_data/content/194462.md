# System bus means for inter processor communication.

## Abstract
A system bus structure and operation for interprocessor communication in an information processing system 102 incorporating a plurality of processing elements 108, 110, 112, 114, 116 , each of which may be capable of independent ly executing certain information processing or handling operations. The system bus structure 104, 106 comprises an access control bus 106 for conducting a bus access signal indicating the occurrence of an interprocessor com munication and a communications bus 104 which includes a first bus for conducting signals indicating that the inter processor communication is a specific one of a first class of communications or is a member of a second class of communications and second bus for communicating the information content of the communication. The first class of communications includes memory related communications. The second class of communications include non memory related communications. The access control bus 106 com prises a loop, with the processor elements connected in series along the access control bus means loop, and the processor elements are connected in parallel to the com munications bus.
