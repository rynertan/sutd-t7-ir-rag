# Catalyst for oxidation.

## Abstract
A catalyst suitable for use in the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen and oxygen is prepared by bringing hydrogen and oxygen into contact with a liquid mixture com prising a fluorocarbon and or halofluorocarbon and water containing bis tri pentafluorophenyl phosphine palladium dichloride. When the reaction mixture is allowed to stand the catalyst appears as a black film at the interface of the organic and aqueous phases. The black film is almost totally insoluble in aqueous hydrogen peroxide.
