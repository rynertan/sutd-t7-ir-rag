## Description
SUSTAINED RELEASE INJECTIONS The present invention relates to a sustainedrelease injection. More particularly, it relates to a sustained release injection which comprises a suspension of a powder comprising an active ingredient and a pharmaceutically acceptable biodegradable carrier in a viscous solvent for injection. It is known that a sustained release injection is prepared by dissolving or suspending an active ingredient in polyethylene glycol, an oil for injection or gelatin solution, but these known preparations are not satisfactory and can not be applied to a water soluble medicament which is effective in a small amount. Besides, although a preparation using a non biodegradable carrier such as silicone is recently used as a sustained release preparation in some medical sections, it is not preferable because when it is administered in a parenteral route, there is a problem of accumulation of the carrier. It has been very desired to make various medicaments in the form of a sustained release injection, because the pharmaceutical activities of the medicaments will be potentiated in such a preparation, and hence, it is useful to develop a sustained release injection of medicaments. The present inventors have intensively studied on an improved sustained release injection of medicaments, and have found that the desired sustained release injection can be obtained by admixing an active ingredient with a specific biodegradable carrier and suspending the powdery mixture in a viscous solvent for injection. An object of the present invention is to provide an improved sustained release in3ection. Another object of the invention is to provide a suspension type, sustainedrelease 1nection which can release the active ingredient and can maintain the desired level ot the active ingredient in blood or in lesional regionstor a long period of time.These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to persons skilled in the art from the following description. The sustained release injection of the present invention is a suspension type preparation, which comprises a powdery mixture of an active ingredient and a pharmaceutically acceptable biodegradable carrier, which is suspended in a viscous solvent for injection. The biodegradable carrier used in the present invention means a carrier which can easily be absorbed or be subject to enzymolysis in body and can be implanted into the body. Suitable examples of the biodegradable carrier are proteins such as collagen, gelatin, albumin polysaccharides such as chitins and synthetic high molecular compounds such as polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, polyglutamic acid, or the like. These substances can be used alone or in any combination of two or more thereof, but in view of safety and easy handling, collagen or gelatin or a mixture thereof are preferable. Collagen is a protein which is a main protein of connective tissue of animals and has less antigenicity, and hence, has widely been used as a safe operation yarn in various medical operations.The collagen may be an atelocollagen having far less antigenicity which is obtained by removing the telopeptide region by treating collagen with an enzyme e.g. pepsin in order to make it safer. Gelatin is a protein derived from collagen. Gelatin is a high molecular weight amphoteric electrolyte which has less antigenicity and properties of convertible between sol and gel forms and is low in cost, and hence it has already been confirmed as a safe substance for medical use. The active ingredient used in the present invention is not specified, but includes particularly watersoluble medicaments which are hardly prepared in the form of a sustained release injection by a conventional method, for example, prostagrandins, prostacyclines, various bio hormones, bleomycins, mitomycin, tespamin triethylenethiophosphoramide , interferon, interleukin, tumor necrosis factor, and further hardly water soluble madicaments which are effective in a very small amount, such as indomethacin, adriamycin, or the like. The medicament includes also 4 carbamoyl imidazolium 5 oleate other name or 4 carbamoyl 5 hydroxyimidazole SM 108 or a salt or a hydrate thereof, which compound and its salts and hydrates is known as a purine antitumor agent and is effective as a metabolic antagonist in purine de novo synthesis. Among the above medicaments, prostaglandins, prostacyclines, various bio hormones, mitomycin, tespamine, interferon, interleukin, and tumor necrosis factor are very unstable not only within a body but also in the torm of a preparation, and hence the activity thereof is largely and rapidly decreased by the conventional release sustaining techniques such as heat treatment or irradiation, or by chemical treatment with organic solvents or aldehydes.Moreover, since these medicaments are water soluble and are used in a very small amount, it is very ditticult to prepare sustained release preparations thereof by a conventional method. Various interferons, interleukins and tumor to they have necrosis factor are somewhat different each other, but in a common that they have very similar molecular weight and are glycoproteinsor proteins and have similar pharmacological and physicochemical properties to those of i interferon,as shown in the experiments disclosed hereinafter, and all of the form of these compounds are prepared in the desired excellent sustained release injections according to the present invention. The viscous solvents used for suspending the powder of the active ingredient and the biodegradable carrier include all conventional solvents for injection, such as vegetable oils, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, silicone oil, medium chain fatty acid triglycerides, or the like. Suitable examples of the vegetable oils are peanut oil, cotton seed oil, sesame oil, castor oil, olive oil, corn oil, iodinated poppy seed oil fatty acids ethyl esters, or the like. The preparation of the present invention contains the active ingredient in an amount in which the active ingredient is usually used. For Example, indomethacin is usually contained in an amount of 0.5 to 500 mg, preferably 1 to 200 mg, per dosage unit, and interferon is usually contained in an amount of 10 to 10 IU, preferably 105 to 5 x 108 IU, per dosage unit, and SM 108 or a salt or hydrate thereof is usually contained in an amount of 1 mg to 2 g, preferably 10 mg to 1 g, per dosage unit. Besides, the ratio of the medicament and the carrier is not specified, but, for example, indomethacin is preferably incorporated in an amount of 0.005 to 1 mg per 1 mg of the carrier, and interferon is preferably incorporated in an amount of 103 to 108 IU per 1 mg of the carrier, and mM 108 is preferably incorporated in an amount of 0.01 to 1 g per 1 mg of the carrier. The sustained release injection of the presentInvention is prepared in the following manner. Firstly, a powder of an active ingredient contained in a biodegradable carrier is prepared, and the powder is suspended in a viscous solvent for injection. The bv preparation of the powder can be done by any methodywhich the active ingredient is incorporated in the carrier, for example, by admixing the active ingredient in an aqueous solution of the biodegradable carrier, lyophilizing the mixture and then pulverizing. Since the pulverizing step is usually exothermic, some medicaments such as interferon are preferably treated under cooling with dry ice or liquid nitrogen. Spray drying is also applicable. The pulverized product having an injectable particle size e.g. 0.1 to 1000rim is then suspended in a viscous solvent for injection to give a sustained release suspension for injection. Alternatively, the pulverized product and the viscous solvent may be packed in the form of ingredients a kit, and both are mixed to prepare a suspension for injection when used. In the sustained release injection preparation of the present invention, the active ingredient is incorporated into the biodegradable carrier in the following state i the active ingredient is chemically bound to the carrier matrix, ii The active ingredient is bound to the carrier matrix by intermolecular action, or iii The active ingredient is physically embraced within the carrier matrix. In the preparation, there may optionally be incorporated conventional pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as stabilizers, preservatives, local anesthetic agents, and some agents for aiding tormability into special shapes of preparations or release sustaining of the active ingredient. These additives are not specified, but suitable examples of the agents for aiding formability are methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, glycolic acid lactic acid copolymer, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, ethyl alcohol, or the like. Suitable examples of the agents for aiding releasesustaining of the active ingredient are cellulose acetate phthalate, ethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, calcium phosphate, lactic acid glycolic acid copolymer, corn starch, rice starch, potato starch, cellulose, arginates, or the like. All steps for the above preparation should be carried out under sterilized conditions because the preparations are used as an injection. Thus, according to the present invention, the medicaments which are water soluble and effective in a very small amount are embraced within a carrier which has affinity with the active ingredient and then are suspended in a viscous solvent suitable for injection in the form of a powder, by which there is prepared a sustained release preparation suitable for injection, which is the novel form of an injection preparation. The present invention is illustrated by the following Experiment and Examples, but should not be construed to be limited thereto. Experiment 1 There were used as the test samples an oily suspension of o interferon collagen preparation prepared inExample 1 disclosed hereinatter Sample a and an aqueous injection of o interferon originated from Namalwa cells Sample b as a reference. The test samples were each administered intramuscularly to rabbit, and the change of level in blood of the active ingredient with lapse of time was measured by RIA radioimmunoassay .
