# Device for straight travelling stabilization and change of attitude on predetermined paths for vehicle axles.

## Abstract
A device for straight travelling stabilization and change of attitude on predetermined paths for vehicle axles, com prising a permanent elastic energy loading unit 10 which applies to the axle stabilizing forces of a greater intensity than the external forces acting thereon, a shifting actuator 20 which, when operated, applies to the axle forces of greater intensity than that of said stabilizing forces and thus causes it to be steered, and a shifting actuator control member 30 which is actuated when there are variations in the travelling attitude of the main steering system of the vehicle. The device permits the axle on which it it applied to be kept in the condition of a fixed axle and permits to render it steering only when the main steering system of the vehicle is subjected to steering.
