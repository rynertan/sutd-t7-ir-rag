GC content of DNA 46.2 . In view of the above microbiological characteristics, Berey s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, 8th Ed. has been referred to for the identification of the strain used in the present invention. This strain does not agree with the genus Pseudomonas having a DNA GC content of 58 to 70 . Vibrio, Photobacterium, Beneckea and Lucibacterium species are inconsistent with the strain because these species are facultative anaerobes and the other characteristics of them are also different from those of the strain. Acinetobacter and Moraxella species, non motile bacteria, differ from the strain. Bdelloxibrio species, obligatory parasites, do not conform to the strain. Halobacterium species, having a DNA GC content of 57 to 68 , do not agree with the strain.The strain of the invention thus differs from the genera described in said manual in terms of important characteristics and does not conform to any of the geneva. Search through taxonomic systems other than revealed in said manual has shown the strain of the invention to be in good agreement with the genus Alteromonas Gram negative, rod, non fermentative, polar flagellate, DNA GC content of 40 to 50 , marine bacteria, aerobic proposed by Baumann et al. Taxonomy of aerobic marine eubacteria,J. Bacteriol. 110 402 429, 1972 . This strain has therefore been identified as a bacterium belonging to the genusAlteromonas. Among the known species of this genus,Alteromonas vaga Baumann et al., 1972 is in accordance with the strain of the present invention possessing the following characteristics a DNA GC content of 46.2 J negativeness of oxidase, no growth at 400C, and no decomposition of starch.The present strain has been deposited in the Fermentation Research Institute, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, Ministry of InternationalTrade and Industry of Japan under the accession number of FERM P 6281. Any mutants obtained either by artificially such as by irradiation with ultraviolet rays or by X rays, treatment with chemicals, or by spontaneous mutation can be used in the present invention as lon as they have the ability to produce the polysaccharide substance MP 67 of the present invention. The polysaccharide substance MP 67 of this invention can be recovered from the fermentation broth bv known methods. For example, the fermentation broth is subjected to centrifugal separation at 7,500 rpm for fifteen minutes to provide a supernatant liquid.A lower alkanol, preferably ethanol is added to the supernatant liquid, and the resulting mixture is allowed to stand in an ice chamber to cause precipitation.The precipitate is isolated, and dried under reduced pressure to obtain a crude form of the poly saccharide substance MP 67.The crude polysaccharide substance MP 67 thus obtained is then further purified. For this purpose, various methods can be used. For example, chloroform and n butanol are added to an aqueous solution of the crude substance, and the resulting mixture is stirred and then subjected to centrifugal separation to obtain a supernatant liquid.The same procedure as above is applied repeatedly once to several times to the supernatant liquid. To the supernatant liquid thus obtained is added ethanol to precipitate a purified form of the polysaccharide substanceMP 67. A 0.05 N NaCl solution of this purified substance is passed through a Sepharose CL 4B column and eluted with 0.05N NaCl at a suitable flow rate. The eluate is fractionated in a predetermined amount, and MP 67 containing fractions are collected and dialyzed to removeNaCl therefrom. Then, ethanol is added to cause precipitation whereby a purified MP 67 fraction can be obtained.The physical and chemical properties of the polysaccharide substance MP 67 of this invention are described below.0.5 ml of 72 sulfuric acid was added to 10 mg of the polysaccharide substance MP 67, and the mixture was allowed to stand for two hours at room temperature. To the mixture was added 7 ml of water, and the resulting mixture was placed in a sealed tube. The tube was heated in an oil bath at 105 C for two hours. The reaction mixture was neutralized with barium hydroxide, and the resulting barium sulfate was removed by filtration. The filtrate was dried under reduced pressure, trimethylsilylated with a commercially available trimethylsilylating agent. Gas chromatographic analysis with reference to a standard sample shows that the polysaccharide substance MP 67 of this invention has the composition aiven in Table 1. Table 1 Rhamnose. .53 5 Glucose 21 2 Mannose 7.0 0.7 Galactose 6.0 0.6 Similar to other polysaccharides, the polysaccharide substance MP 67 of this invention is hygroscopic, and thus difficult to analyze accurately. One example of its elemental analysis is C 39.87 H 6.89 t and N 1.98 .The carhon nitrogen ratio of the polysaccharide substanceMP 67 of this invention is C N 20 1. The average molecular weight determined by a gel filtration method using Sepharose CL 4B is 2 x 10 to 4 x 105. The infrared absorption spectrum employing the KBr tablet is shown in Fig. 3.

The components of the polysaccharide substanceMP 67 of this invention contain an unidentified substance.To identify this substance, further investigation was carried out in the following way 1 ml of 1N H2SO4 was added to about 5 m of Sample III to be described later.The mixture was placed in a sealed tube, and heated in an oil bath at 100 CC for five hours for hydrolysis. After cooling, the reaction mixture was neutralized with a saturated solution of barium hydroxide, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for fifteen minutes to remove the precipitate formed. The supernatant was lyophilized and dissolved in 0.5 ml of water. The solution was subjected to thinlayer chromatography on a plate Xieselael 60 F, a product of Erk , using a 4 4 2 mixture of isopropanol, acetone and 0.1 M lactic acid as a developing agent. The plate had been dipped in a 0.5 M NaH2PO4 solution, airdried, and heated at 1050C for one hour. The thinlaver chromatoraphy gave the results shown in Table 2. The sugars were detected by spraying the plate with an anis aldehde sulfuric acid solution, follwed by heating the sprayed plate at 10500.
