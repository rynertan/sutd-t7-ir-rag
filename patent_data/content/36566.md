# Discrete type automated chemical analytic apparatus.

## Abstract
A discrete type automated chemical analytic apparatus, wherein a carrier 67 is made movable through a path 68 defined above a reaction line 14 in order to pipette a specimen and reagent into the selected one of a plurality of reaction tubes 13 linearly mounted on the top run 10a of an endless belt 10 . A specimen container 21 and reagent containers 22, 23 are set side by side above the extension of the reaction line. Nozzles 40, 57, 58 are mounted on the carrier 67 in a vertically movable state to draw out the contents of the specimen container 21 and reagent containers 22, 23 . The carrier 67 is moved to any selected point on the reaction line 14 by a motor 73 with the aid of a belt conveyor 70 connected to said carrier 67 , and a pair of pulleys 71, 72 across which the belt conveyor 70 is stretched.
