## Abstract
Method and apparatus for removing hydrocarbons from discarded tires by pyrolysis. Tire fragments are conveyed through a reactor vessel 32 and indirectly heated by means of a hollow flight screw conveyor. The heated vapors effluent from the reactor vessel 32 are cooled in a first stage condenser 402, 418 500 to a predetermined temperature. An uncondensed part of the vapors is cooled in a second stage condenser 404, 420 505 to a lower temperature than in the first stage condenser 402, 418 500 .
