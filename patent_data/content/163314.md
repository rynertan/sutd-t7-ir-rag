## Description
This invention relates to a color photographic material, and more particularly to a high quality color photographic material which has a high dye forming efficiency in the color development step, the photographic properties of which are not influenced by the deviation of pH of a color developing bath, and which is excellent in retaining good color balance of color images after storage of the photographic material. As magenta color image forming couplers hereinafter referred to more simply as magenta couplers , various pyrazolone derivatives are known. However, these pyrazolone derivative couplers show low coloring efficiency conversion efficiency of the coupler into a dye when they are used for color photographic materials. Particularly, in a so called four equivalent coupler having no substituent at the coupling position, the coupler forms a dye to an extent of only about 1 2 mole of dye per mole of coupler. As a coupler for improving the coloring efficiency, a so called two equivalent coupler, e.g., a pyrazolone type magenta coupler having a substituent introduced at the coupling active position thereof, with the substituent being split off released in a color development step, is known. Examples of such couplers are described in U.S. Patents 3,311,476, 3,419,391, 3,617,291, 3,926,631, etc. Also, magenta couplers having a substituent connected through a sulfur atom to the coupling active position of the coupler are known. Examples include couplers having a thiocyano group as described in U.S. Patent 3,214,437 couplers having an acylthio group or a thioacylthio group as described in U.S. Patent 4,032,346 couplers having an arylthio group or a heterocyclic thio group as described in U.S. Patents 3,227,554, and 3,701,783 and further as described in Japanese Patent Publication No. 34,044 78 and couplers having an alkylthio group as described in West German Patent Application OLS No. 2,944,601. Also Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 57,239 84 describes a pyrazolone coupler having a substituted alkylthio group of a specific chemical structure as a releasable group the term OPI indicates an unexamined Japanese patent application open to public inspection and Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 57,240 84 describes a specific magenta coupler having a releasable group which blocks sulfur atom in the alkylthio group by an intramolecular nucleophilic reaction after a coupling reaction However, the present inventors have found that when a coupler having an arylthio group at the coupling active position thereof in the magenta couplers as described in U.S. Patents 3,227,554 and 3,70l,783 is used for a color photographic material and color images are formed, the images thus formed are insufficient in storability. In other words, when color images formed using the above described color photographic material are stored for a long period of time, the color images are insufficient with respect to resisting change in densities discoloring and fading by the action of light, heat, humidity, etc. change of balance of the three colors, yellow, magenta, and cyan and the occurrence of staining in non colored portions. Furthermore, it has also been found that when the magenta coupler having an arylthio group as a releasable group described in aforesaid Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 34,044 78 is used for color photographic material and color images are formed using the color photographic material, the color images formed are insufficient in storability as in the above described case. Moreover, it can be said that the magenta coupler having an arylthio group as the releasable group described in Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 35,858 82 is a significant coupler in the point of overcoming the problem of light fastness among the above described various difficulties of the conventional magenta couplers, but the color photographic materials using these magenta couplers still leave room for improvement with respect to the change in color balance after fading and the formation of stain. Also, the conventional magenta couplers having an arylthio group as the releasable group as described above encounter the problem that the coloring property is reduced in the case of processing the color photographic materials containing the couplers with a color developer containing a salt of an alkaline earth metal such as calcium, magnesium, etc. This becomes a fatal defect in the case of preparing the processing liquid using water containing a large amount of alkaline earth metal salts, i.e., hard water. Further, in color developing laboratories around the world, it is rare to be able to use soft water for the processing liquid, and hard water is usually employed as the water for the processing liquid. Accordingly, color photographic materials containing conventionally known magenta couplers having an arylthio group as a releasing group can be developed only in definite developing laboratories using no hard water, although the coulers have some characteristics. This invention is based on the discovery of excellent properties provided by certain combinations of cyan and magenta couplers as set forth hereinafter. For instances, the magenta couplers which are used for the color photographic materials of this invention have the feature that the change in color balance of the color images during the storage thereof is less, the formation of stain is restrained, and the coloring property is not reduced even in the case of using a processing solution using hard water, together with the merits such as those of the above described known magenta couplers having an arylthio group as the releasable group as described in Japanese Patent Publication No. 35,858 82. The excellent properties of the color photographic materials of this invention as described above have never been expected based on other color photographic materials containing the aforesaid conventional magenta couplers having an arylthio group as the releasable group. Thus, the present invention overcomes the above described difficulties in the conventional color photographic materials. A first object of this invention therefore, is, to provide a color photographic material capable of providing color photographic images having good coloring properties and being excellent in color reproducibility even in a developer prepared using hard water containing alkaline earth metal ions. A second object of this invention is to provide a color photographic material capable of providing the above described color images the non image portions which of are not stained even when the color images are exposed to heat, humidity or light for a long period of time. A third object of this invention is to provide a color photographic material capable of providing color photographic images the image portions of which show less fading in the whole density regions and show no deviation of color balance. A fourth object of this invention is to provide a color photographic material capable of providing color images having more improved stability to heat, humidity, and light by containing various additives.

For example, cyan couplers are described in U.S. Patents 2,772,162 and 4,333,999, Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 98,731 83, Japanese Patent Publication No. 11,572 74, etc. magenta couplers are described in Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 35,858 82, 2,953 85, 23,855 85, etc. yellow couplers are described in Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 48,541 79, Japanese Patent Publication No. 10,739 83 U.S. Patent 4,326,024, Also, the highly coloring ballast groups described, for example, in Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 42,045 83, 214,854 84, 177,553 84, 177,554 84, 177,557 84, etc., can be employed for the above described couplers in this invention. Each of cyane and magenta couplers is incorporated in each silver halide emlsion layer, respectively, in an amount of from 2 x 10³ to 5 x 10¹ mole, and preferably from 1 x 10 ² to 5 x 10¹ mole, per mole of the silver halide in the emulsion layer. Also, the molar ratio of the cyan coupler the magenta coupler for use in this invention is in the range of 1 about 0.2 to 1.5, but ratios other than above can be also employed in this invention. When a cyan coupler other than those defined in i and a magenta coupler other than those defined in ii are used, they may be used in an amount of from 0.2 to 1.5 moles per mole of each coupler defined in i and ii . For incorporating the above described couplers in silver halide photographic emulsion layers, known various techniques can be used in this invention. For example, the coupler can usually be added to a silver halide emulsion by an oil drop in water type dispersing method. That is, the coupler is dissolved in a high boiling organic solvent or a low boiling organic solvent and then the solution is dispersed in an aqueous gelatin solution containing a surface active agent. Or, water or an aqueous gelatin solution is added to an organic solvent solution of the copler containing a surface active agent and an oil drop in water type dispersion may be prepared by utilizing a phase inversion. Furthermore, when the couler is an alkali soluble coupler, the couler can be dispersed by a so called Fischer dispersing method. Also, after removing the low boiling organic solvent from the cupler dispersion by distillation, noodle washing, or ultrafiltration, the dispersion of the coupler may be mixed with a silver halide photographic emulsion. In more detail, for introducing the yellow copler, the magenta coupler, or the cyan coupler into a silver halide emulsion layer of the color photographic material of this invention, a high boiling organic solvent having a boiling point of higher than 160 C, such as a phthalic acid alkyl ester e.g., dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, etc. , a phosphoric acid ester e.g., diphenyl phosphate, triphenyl phosphate, tricresyl phosphate, dioctylbutyl phosphate, etc. , a citric acid ester e.g, tributyl acetylcitrate, etc. , a benzoic acid ester e.g., octyl benzoate, etc. , an alkylamide e.g., diethyllaurylamide, etc. , a fatty acid ester e.g., dibutoxyethyl succinate, dioctyl azelate, etc. , a phenol e.g., 2,4 di t amylphenol, etc. , etc., or a low boiling organic solvent having a boiling point of 30 to 150 C, such as a lower alkyl acetate e.g., butyl acetate , ethyl propionate, secondary butyl alcohol, methyl isobutyl ketone, β ethoxyethyl acetate, methyl cellosolve acetate, etc., can be used solely or as a mixture thereof. The phthalic acid alkyl esters and the phosphoric acid esters are preferably used in this invention. A color photographic material sometimes causes a so called stain, i.e., a color density at the unexposed areas thereof during development or during the storage thereof after development. This stain reduces the whiteness of the background portion of the color images and also causes color turbidity at the image portions, which results in reducing the visual sharpness of the images. Various additives have been investigated for preventing the occurrence of stain, but the effective additives are classified into antioxidants and amines. As the antioxidant which can be used for the above described purpose, there are hydroquinones, aminophenols, gallic acid derivatives, ascorbic acid derivatives, spiroindan derivatives, 3 pyrazolone derivatives, etc., are effective and preferably hydroquinones and spiroindane derivatives are used solely or as a mixture thereof. Also, amines are effectively used for preventing the occurrence of stain or color turbidity as described above and can be used solely or, preferably, together with the aforesaid antioxidants. Preferred amines are the N substituted anilines described, for example, in Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 105,147 83 the steric hindrance cyclic tertiary amines described, for example, in Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 102,231 83 N substituted aminotriazines described, for example, in Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 218,445 84, and the tertiary alkylamines described, for example, in Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 229,559 84. The amines reduce the activity by forming salts with pyrazolone type couplers in a neutral state. Also, the antioxidants control or reduce the formation of stain under dark heat and light exposure since they prevent the occurrence of the air oxidation of couplers or leuco dyes. The antioxidant is used in an amount of from 0.2 to 2 moles, and preferably from 0.7 to 1.3 moles, per mole of the coupler and the amine is used in an amount of from 0.8 to 2.0 moles, and preferably from 1.1 to 1.6 moles, per mole of the coupler. It is preferred that the antioxidant or the amine is emulsified together with coupler. In some cases, the amines and the antioxidants may be used in place of the high boiling organic solvent. The use of the magenta coupler for use in this invention together with an amine, in particular, the N substituted aniline described in Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 105,147 83 can reduce the occurrence of yellow stain in the case of storing the color print under light exposure, hereinafter referred to as light stain as well as having a particularly remarkable effect for the reduction of light fading of magenta color images. Also, the N substituted aniline is effective for restraining the formation of yellow stain in the case of storing color prints under the condition of high temperature and or high humidity. The color photographic materials of this invention may further contain specific couplers in addition to the yellow couplers, magenta couplers, and cyan couplers represented by the above described formulae. For example, a colored magenta coupler may be incorporated in a green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer to impart a masking effect to the emulsion layer. Also, development inhibitor releasing couplers DIR couplers or development inhibitor releasing hydroquinones can be used for color sensitive emulsion layers or layers adjacent to these color sensitive emulsion layers. The development inhibitor released from these compounds with the progress of the development gives an interlayer multilayer effect such as improvement of the sharpness of images, improvement of the grain fineness of images, and improvement of the monochromatic saturation. In the color photographic material of this invention, a coupler capable of releasing a development accelerator or a nucleating agent with silver development can be incorporated in the silver halide photographic emulsion layer or a layer adjacent to the emulsion layer for improving the photographic sensitivity, improving the grainness of color images, and increasing the contrast of gradation. In this invention, a ultraviolet absorbent may be incorporated in any desired layer of the color photographic material, but is preferably incorporated in the silver halide emulsion layer containing the compound represented by above described formula I or II or a layer adjacent to the emulsion layer. Ultraviolet absorbents which can be used in this invention are described, for example, in In formula VI , R₁₉, R₂₀, R₂₁, R₂₂, and R₂₃, which may be the same or different, each represents a hydrogen atom or a group described hereinbefore as a substituent for the aromatic group shown by R₁ or R₄ in formula I or II above and said R₂₂ and R₂₃ can together form a 5 or 6 membered aromatic carbon ring. The groups described above may be further substituted by substituents as described for R₁ or R₄ in formula I or II . The ultraviolet absorbents represented by formula VI may be used singly or as a mixture thereof. Specific examples of the ultraviolet absorbent which can be used in this invention are illustrated below. Synthesis methods for the compounds represented by formula VI and examples of other ultraviolet absorbents which can also be used in this invention are described, for example, in Japanese Patent Publication No. 29,620 69 Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 151,149 75, 95,233 79 U.S. Patent 3,766,205 European Patent No. 57,160 The above described ultraviolet absorbent is dissolved in a high boiling organic solvent and or a low boiling organic solvent as in the case of the foregoing coupler and then is dispersed in an aqueous solution of a hydrophilic colloid. There is no particular restriction on the amounts of the high boiling organic solvent and the ultraviolet absorbent, but usually, a high boiling organic solvent is used in the range of from 0 to 300 weight based on the weight of the ultraviolet absorbent. A ultraviolet absorbent which is in a liquid state at normal temperature is preferably used individually or in combination. When the ultraviolet absorbent shown by formula VI described above is used together with the combination of the couplers of this invention described above, the storability, and in particular, the color fastness to light of color images, most particularly cyan images can be improved. The ultraviolet absorbent may be emulsified together with the cyan coupler. The amount of the ultraviolet absorbent should be sufficient for imparting light stability to a cyan dye image, but if the amount is too large, the unexposed areas white portions of the color photographic material are sometimes yellowed. Thus, the amount of the ultraviolet absorbent is preferably from 1 x 10 ⁴ mole m² to 2 x 10 ³ mole m², and more preferably from 5 x 10 ⁴ mole m² to 1.5 x 10 ³ mole m². In an ordinary layer constitution of a color photographic paper, the ultraviolet absorbent is usually incorporated in one layer, preferably two layers adjacent to one side or both sides of a red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing a cyan coupler. When the ultraviolet absorbent is incorporated in a interlayer between a green sensitive emulsion layer and a red sensitive emulsion layer, the ultaviolet absorbent may be emulsified together with a color mixing preventing agent. When the ultraviolet absorbent is incorporated in a protective layer, another protective layer may be formed on the protective layer as the outermost layer. The outermost protective layer may contain a matting agent having any desired particle sizes. For improving the storability of colored dye images, and in particular yellow dye images and magenta dye images, various organic or metal complex type fading preventing agents may be used together therewith. As such organic fading prevent agent, hydroquinones, gallic acid derivatives, p alkoxyphenols, p oxyphenol, etc., may be used. Dye image stabilizers, stain preventing agents, and antioxidants which can be used in this invention are described in the patents cited in Also, metal complex type fading preventing agents are described in For improving the fastness of yellow dye images to heat and light, phenols, hydroquinones, hydroxychroman, hydroxycoumarans, hindered amines, and the alkylethers, silylethers, or hydrolyzable precursor derivatives thereof can be used. The addition amount of the fading preventing agent for yellow dye images depends upon the nature of the yellow coupler used together with the fading agent but is usually in the range of from 0.5 to 200 by weight, preferably in the range of from 2 to 150 by weight with respect to the yellow coupler. Preferably, the fading agent is emulsified together with the yellow coupler. In the color photographic materials of this invention, preferred fading preventing agents for magenta dye images are described, for example, in U.S. Patents 3,336,135, 3,432,300, 3,573,050, 3,574,627, 3,700,455, 3,764,337, 3,935,016, 3,982,944, 4,254,216, and 4,279,990 U.K. Patents 1,347,556, 2,062,888, 2,066,975, and 2,077,455 Japanese Patent Application No. 205,278 83 Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 152,225 77, 17,729 78, 20,327 78, 145,530 79, 6321 80, 21,004 80, 24,141 83, and 10,539 84 Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 31,625 73, 12,337 79, etc. These fading preventing agents can greatly improve color fastness to light. The amount of the aforesaid fading preventing agent is generally from 1 to 200 mole , and preferably from 5 to 100 mole , with respect to the amount of magenta coupler used. It is preferred that the fading preventing agent be emulsified together with the magenta coupler. For fading prevention, a technique of covering a dye image with an oxygen shielding layer composed of a material having a low oxygen permeability is described, for example, in Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 11,330 74 and 57,223 75 and also a technique for forming a layer having an oxygen permeability of less than 20 ml m².hr.atom at the support side of a dye image forming layer of a color photographic material is described in Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 85,747 81. These techniques can be applied for this invention. For silver halide emulsion layers of the color photographic materials of this invention, various kinds of silver halides can be used. For example, silver chloride, silver bromide, silver chlorobromide, silver iodobromide, and silver chloroiodobromide can be used. Silver iodobromide containing from 2 to 20 mole silver iodide and silver chlorobromide containing from 10 to 50 mole silver bromide are preferably used in this invention. There are no particular restrictions about the crystal form, crystal structure, grain sizes, grain size distribution, etc., of silver halide grains for use in this invention. The crystal form of the silver halide may be a regular crystal form or twin form. Furthermore, the crystal form may be a hexahedron, an octahedron, or a tetradecahedron. Furthermore, tabular silver halide grains having a thickness of less than 0.5 micron, a diameter of at least 0.6 micron, and a mean aspect ratio of higher than 5 1, as described in The crystal structure of silver halide may be uniform throughout the crystals or may differ in formation between the inside and the outside of the crystal, may form a layer structure, may be composed of silver halide crystals having different formation connected with each other by an epitaxial connection, or may be a mixture of silver halide crystals of various different crystal forms. Moreover, the silver halide crystal grains may be mainly forming latent image at the surface of the grains, or may be mainly forming latent image inside of the grains. The grain size of silver halide may be 0.1 microns or less, or may be a large grain size such as up to 3 microns of a projection area diameter. Furthermore, the emulsion may be a monodisperse emulsion of silver halide having a narrow distribution of grain size or may be a multidisperse emulsion of silver halide having a wide distribution of grain size. The silver halide grains can be produced by known methods conventionally employed in art. The above described silver halide emulsions for use in this invention can be sensitized by an ordinary chemical sensitization, i.e., a sulfur sensitization, noble metal sensitization or a combination thereof. Furthermore, the silver halide emulsions for use in this invention can be sensitized to a desired light sensitive wavelength region using sensitizing dyes. As dyes which are advantageously used in this invention, there are methine dyes and styryl dyes such as cyanine dyes, hemicyanine dyes, rhodacyanine dyes, merocyanine dyes, oxonole dyes, hemioxonole dyes, etc., as is explained below in more detail. They can be used singly or as a combination of two or more dyes. Support for use in this invention include transparent supports such as polyethylene terephthalate films and cellulose triacetate films and reflection supports as described below. Reflection supports are preferred in this invention, and include baryta coated papers, polyethylene coated papers, polypropylene series synthetic papers, and transparent supports such as glass plates, polyester films e.g., polyethylene terephthalate films, etc. , cellulose acetate films, cellulose nitrate films, polyamide films, polycarbonate films, polystyrene films, etc., each laminated with a reflective layer or having a reflector. The support can be selected according to the use of the photographic material. The blue sensitive emulsion, green sensitive emulsion and red sensitive emulsion for use in this invention are prepared by spectrally sensitizing each silver halide emulsion with, for example, a methine dye or others to impart each color sensitivity to each emulsion. Dyes which are used for this purpose include cyanine dyes, merocyanine dyes, complex cyanine dyes, complex meocyanine dyes, holopolar cyanine dyes, hemicyanine dyes, styryl dyes, and hemioxonole dyes. Particularly useful dyes are cyanine dyes, merocyanine dyes, and complex merocyanine dyes. The color photographic material of this invention may has, in addition to the above described photographic emulsion layers, auxiliary layers such as subbing layer, interlayers, a protective layer, etc. Also, if necessary, a second ultraviolet absorptive layer may be formed between the red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and the green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer. It is preferred to use the above described ultraviolet absorbent for the ultraviolet absorptive layer, but other known ultraviolet absorbents may be used. As the binder or protective colloid for photographic emulsions, gelatin is advantageously, used but other hydrophilic colloids can also be used, including gelatin derivatives graft polymers of gelatin with other high molecular materials proteins such as albumin, casein, etc. cellulose derivatives such as hydroxyethyl cellulose carboxymethyl cellulose, cellulose sulfuric acid esters, etc. sugar derivatives such as sodium alginate, starch derivatives, etc. and various synthetic hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl alcohol partial acetal, poly N vinylpyrrolidone, polyacrylic acid, polymethacrylic acid, polyacrylamide, polyvinyl imidazole, polyvinyl pyrazole, etc. As the gelatin, limed gelatin as well as acid treated gelatin and enzyme treated gelatin as described in In the color photographic materials of this invention, the silver halide photographic emulsion layers and other hydrophilic colloid layers may further contain whitening agents such as stilbene series, triazine series, oxazole series, or cumarine series whitening agents. they may be water soluble or may be in the form of a dispersion of a water insoluble whitening agent. Practical examples of the whitening agents are described, for example, in U.S. Patents 2,632,701, 3,269,840, and 3,359,102 U.K. Patents 852,075 and 1,319,763 When dyes or ultraviolet absorbents are incorporated in hydrophilic coloid layers of the color photographic materials of this invention, they may be mordanted by a cationic polymer. For this purpose, polymers that can be used include those described, for example, in U.K. Patent 685,475 U.S. Patents 2,675,316, 2,839,401, 2,882,156, 3,048,487, 3,184,309, and 3,445,231 West German Patent Application OLS No. 1,914,362 Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 47,624 75, 71,332 75, etc. The color photographic materials of this invention may further contain hydroquinone derivatives, aminophenol derivatives, gallic acid derivatives, ascorbic acid derivatives, etc., and specific examples thereof are described, for example, in U.S. Patents 2,360,290, 2,336,327, 2,403,721, 2,418,613, 2,675,314, 2,701,197, 2,704,713, 2,728,659, 2,732,300, and 2,735,765 Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 92,988 75, 92,989 75, 93,928 75, 110,337 75, and 146,235 77 Japanese Patent Publication No. 23,813 75, etc. The color photographic materials of this invention may further contain, if desired, various additives which are known in the art, such as stabilizers, antifoggants, surface active agents, couplers other than the above described couplers of this invention, filter dyes, irradiation preventing dyes, developing agents, etc. Examples thereof are described, for example, in Furthermore, as the case may be, the silver halide emulsion layers or other hydrophilic colloid layers of the photographic materials of this invention may further contain fine silver halide emulsion grains e.g., silver chloride emulsion, silver bromide emulsion, or silver chlorobromide emulsion having a mean grain size of less than 0.20 micron having substantially no light sensitivity. A color developer for developing the color photographic materials of this invention is preferably an alkaline aqueous solution containing an aromatic primary amine color developing agent as the amine component. Examples of the color developing agent include, for example, 4 amino N,N diethylaniline, 3 methyl 4 N,N diethylaniline, 4 amino N ethylN β hydroxyethylaniline, 3 methyl 4 amino N ethyl β hydroxyethylaniline, 3 methyl 4 amino N ethyl N β methane sulfonamidoethylaniline, 4 amino 3 methyl N ethyl N β methoxyethylaniline, etc. The color developer may further contain a pH buffer such as a sulfite, carbonate, borate and phosphate of an alkali metal a development inhibitor such as a bromide, an iodide, and an organic antifoggant an antifoggant, etc. Also, the color developer may contain, if desired, a water softener a preservative such as hydroxylamine, etc. an organic solvent such as benzyl alcohol, diethylene glycol, etc. a development accelerator such as polyethylene glycol, a quaternary ammonium salt, an amine, etc. a dye forming coupler, a competing coupler, a foggint agent such as sodium boronhydride, etc. an auxiliary developing agent such as 1 phenyl 3 pyrazolidone, etc. a tackifier a polycarboxylic acid series chelating agent as described in U.S. Patent 4,083,723 an antioxidant as described in West German Patent Application OLS No. 2,622,950, etc. The color photographic material is usually bleached after color development. The bleach process may be performed together with a fix process or may be performed separately from the fix process. Examples of the fixing agent include compounds of polyvalent metals such as iron III , cobalt III , chromium VI , copper II , etc. peracids quinones nitroso compounds, etc. For example, ferricyanides bichromates orgnic complex salts of iron III or cobalt III such as organic complex salts of aminopolycarboxylic acids e.g., ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid, 1,3 diamino 2 propanoltetraacetic acid, etc. , cirtic acid, tartatic acid, malic acid, etc. permanganates persulfates nitrosophenol, etc. Of these materials, potassium ferricyanide, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid iron III sodium, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid iron III ammonium are particularly advantageous. The ethylenediaminetetracetic acid iron III complex salt can be advantageous for a bleach liquid and a blix i.e., bleach fixing liquid. The color photographic materials may be washed with water after color development or blix process. The color development can be performed at an optional temperature between 18 C and 55 C. The color development is performed at temperatures of higher than, preferably 30 C, and more preferably higher than 35 C. The developing time is in the range of about from 1 minute to about 3.5 minutes, but the time is better to be as short as possible. For a continuous development process, it is preferred to supplement a fresh developer and usually a fresh developer of 160 ml to 330 ml, preferably less than 100 ml per square meter of the processed area of color photographic material is supplemented. The concentration of benzyl alcohol in the color developer is preferably less than 5 ml ℓ. The blix can be performed at temperatures of 18 C to 50 C but is preferably performed higher than 30 C. When the blix is performed at a temperature of higher than 35 C, the processing time can be shortened within one minute and the amount of the supplementing liquid can be reduced. The time required for water washing after color development or blixing is usually less than 3 minutes, but the time can be reduced to within one minute if desired by using a stabilization bath. Colored dyes are generally subject to deterioration and fading by light, heat, or humidity as well as by molds. The deterioration by mold is particularly large in cyan dye images, and hence it is preferred to use an antimold agent. Specific exmaples of antimold agents are the 2 thiazolylbenzimidazoles as described in Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 157,244 82. The antimold agent may be incorporated in the photographic materials or may be added in the development step from outside. The antimold agent may be incorporated or added to the photographic material in any step as long as the antimold agent is able to coexist with the processed photographic material. Based on the foregoing description, it is seen that the merits of the color photographic materials of this invention include following First, in this invention, a color photographic material capable of providing color photographic images having good colors and excellent color reproducibility even it is developed in a developer prepared by hard water containing an alkaline earth metal ion can be obtained by the new combination of magenta coupler and cyan coupler. Second, the color images thus obtained do not cause stains at the non image areas even when the color images are exposed to heat, humidity, or light for a long period of time. Third, the images thus formed show less fading and no deviation in color balance over the whole density range of the image portions. Fourth, the color images containing various additives as described above show more improved stability to heat, humidity, or light. The following example will still further illustrate the present invention. Each of color photographic materials Samples A to M was prepared by coating the first layer the lowermost layer to the 7th layer the uppermost layer on a paper support having polyethylene layers on both sides thereof as shown in Tables I and II described below. The coating liquid for the first layer was prepared in the following manner. That is, 100 g of the yellow coupler shown in Table I below was dissolved in a mixture of 40 ml of trinonyl phosphate TNP and 200 ml of ethyl acetate and the solution was dispersed by emulsification in 800 g of an aqueous 10 gelatin solution containing 80 ml of an aqueous solution of 1 sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate. Then, the total amount of the emulsified dispersion was mixed with 1450 g containing 66.7 g of Ag of a blue sensitive silver chlorobromide emulsion 80 Br to provide the coating liquid. Coating liquids for other layers were also prepared by similar methods. For each layer, 2,4 dichloro 6 hydroxy S triazine sodium salt was used as a hardening agent. Also, as a spectral sensitizer for each silver halide emulsion layer, the following compound was used. Also, as an irradiation preventing dye for each silver halide emulsion layer, the following dye was used. The chemical structures of compounds Each of the samples was gradation exposed using an enlarger, Fuji Color Head 690 trademark for product of Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. so that the color density after development contained the portions of 1.0 and 2.0 in gray scale. Then, the sample was processed by the procssing steps as described hereinbelow. Similarly, samples developed in the same manner without being exposed to light were also prepared. In these experiments, water used for the developer was hard water containing 150 ppm of calcium ion and 50 ppm of magnesium ion . The compositions of the processing liquids used for the processing steps were as follows. Each of the sample thus developed was subjected to a fading and discoloring test by exposing the sample to a xenon tester illuminance of 130,000 lux for 3 days or 7 days. Also, the sample were subjected to a fading and discoloring test by storing them in a chamber maintained at 60 C and 70 RH for 2 weeks or 4 weeks. The measurement of density was performed by blue light, green light or red light using a Macbeth densitometer, RD 514, whereby the density change of the initial densities of 1.0 and 2.0 was measured and also the density change stain of a blank white sample was measured. Results obtained are shown in Table II and Table III. The stain density which corresponds to the yellow stain component was measured by blue light. From the results shown below, the following matters are clearly seen Furthermore, in the comparison of the test results of Samples D to M of this invention, the difference between Samples E and F or between Samples J and K is based on the presence or absence of Compound
