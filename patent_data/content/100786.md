# Dividers for boxes.

## Abstract
A method of producing box dividers is disclosed in which a web W is cut longitudinally thereby to produce a box divider 14 on each side thereof. The web is also cut transversely at 10 to separate off individual box dividers. The longitudinal cut line is such that the two box dividers produced each have, along the edge formed by the cut line, a series of peaks 16 alternating with a series of valleys 18 . The width of the web can equal that of the pair of dividers so that each divider has a further longitudinal edge constituted by one of the longitudinal edges of the web. In another form the web is cut longitudinally three times, once centrally and parallel to the longitudinal edges thereof, and twice to form dividers.
