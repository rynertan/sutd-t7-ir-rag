# Cold water soluble granular starch.

## Abstract
A cold water swelling granular starch material derived from ungelatinized corn starch and characterised by a cold water solubility of at least 50 is prepared by subjecting granular corn starch, slurred in selected aqueous alcohols, to conditions of high temperature and pressure. The cold water swelling granular starch material derived from che mically unmodified or minimally modified ungelatinized corn starch has an ability to set to a sliceable gel without cooking or chilling when blended with an aqueous sugar syrup. That granular starch material is particularly useful in food systems of the type which set or gel upon standing such as pie fillings, jellies, demouldable desserts and puddings.
