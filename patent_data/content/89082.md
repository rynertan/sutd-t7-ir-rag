# Margarine fat blend, and a process for producing said fat blend.

## Abstract
I. A margarine fat blend comprising a liquid oil and a hardstock predominantly consisting of triglycerides from 2 saturated C₁₆ ₁₈ fatty acids and 1 saturated C₁₂ ₁₄ fatty acid. Said hardstock can be used at levels as low as 4 by weight along with liquid oils comprising triglycerides from polyun saturated fatty acids, for producing diet margarines. II. A process for producing said margarine fat blend, comprising interesterification of a triglycerides rich in C₁₆ ₁₈ fatty acid residues with b triglycerides rich in C₁₂ ₁₄ fatty acid residues and fractionation of the interester ified mixture.
