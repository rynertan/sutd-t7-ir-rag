# Electron beam apparatus comprising an anode which is included in the cathode Wehnelt cylinder unit.

## Abstract
A cathode 32 , a Wehnelt cylinder 2, 36 and an anode 3, 51 are accommodated in an integrated unit in an electron beam apparatus. Extremely accurate positioning of a Wehnelt bore and an anode bore with respect to one another can be achieved in such an assembled unit which is mounted in the apparatus so as to be removable as one unit. An exactly defined distance between the Wehnelt cylinder and the anode can also be adjusted. As a result of the exact mutual positioning, the anode bore can be chosen to be so small that it can also act as a beam aperture so that a smaller electron optical object as well as a substantial reduction of the mutual electron interaction in the beam is achieved.

## Description
The invention relates to an electron beam apparatus comprising a cathode, a Wehnelt cylinder, an anode and an electron optical system for alignment and modulation of an electron beam to be emitted by the cathode. Such an electron beam apparatus is known in the form of an electron microscope from Philips Technical Review, Vol. 29, 1968, pp. 370 386. In an apparatus described therein a filament or cathode and a Wehnelt cylinder are combined as usual so as to form one unit which is mounted in the apparatus so as to be removable as a single unit. When a comparatively small emissive cathode surface area is realized, an electron spot having small transverse dimensions can be formed in the apparatus. The Wehnelt cylinder which is mounted near the cathode comprises an aperture wherethrough an electron beam to be emitted by the cathode enters the electron optical system of the apparatus. A customary voltage difference of at the most a few hundreds of volts prevails between the Wehnelt cylinder and the cathode during operation. From a mechanical as well as an electrical point of view, an anode of the described apparatus is fully integral with the electron optical system and is mounted in the apparatus so as to be separately removable. The anode usually carries a potential which deviates at least a few kV from that of the Wehnelt cylinder. Therefore, the anode should be mounted, so as to be suitably electrically insulated from the cathode Wehnelt cyinder unit. Even though good results have been obtained by means of the known construction, problems are encountered in view of the increasingly more severe requirements imposed on the alignment of the cathode Wehnelt cylinder unit also referred to as the electron gun and the anode with respect to one another. It is the object of the invention to mitigate this drawback to achieve this, an electron beam apparatus of the kind set forth in accordance with the invention is characterized in that the anode and the Wehnelt cylinder are positioned with respect to one another by mounting the anode in a support which is rigidly connected to a Wehnelt cylinder support Because the anode in accordance with the invention forms one, mechanically rigid unit together with the cathode Wehnelt cylinder unit, a very high accuracy can be achieved as regards the positioning of the grid bore and the anode bore with respect to one another, and an exactly defined distance can be realized between the Wehnelt cylinder and the anode. For a given potential difference to be used between the Wehnelt cylinder and the anode in a preferred embodiment, the anode can be positioned at such a distance from the Wehnelt cylinder that a cross over, to be formed by the electron beam, is situated at least substantially in the plane of the anode bore. Notably due to the exact positioning of the Wehnelt on the anode with respect to one another the anode bore can be chosen to be smaller than the expected cross section of the cross over at this area. Consequently, only the electrons of the beam which extend best in the axial direction will be conducted, so that an electron beam with reduced cross section and current occurs in image formation or spot shaping can be realized in the electron optical system. The degree of beam stopping can be chosen at will so that the beam can be optimized. In the case of comparatively extensive beam stopping where a substantial pat of the mission current is intercepted, electron optically a smaller spot is realized whilst at the same time energy spread and brightness reduction due to the interaction of the electrons in the electron optical system after the anode stop reduced. The possible effects thereof on the quality of beam shaping are described in Advances in Electronics and Electron Physics , 1983, Suppln. 13C, Rose et al. pp 524 525 and Optik, 1983, No. 3, pp. 179 207. In a further preferred embodiment the beam stopping aperture is arranged at a distance from the plane of the cross over so that is has no effect thereon. However the total current is thus advantageously reduced, and because the aperture is now situated in a substantially field free space, requirements imposed as regards orientation wil be less severe. Some embodiments in accordance with the invention will be described in detail hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawing therein An electron microscope as shown in fig. 1 comprises a cathode 1, a Wehnelt cylinder electrode 2, an anode 3, a beam blanking device 4, a beam scanning system 5, a beam alignment system 6 and a final lens 7 and a specimen stage 8 with a specimen adjustment device 9. All said elements are accomodated in a housing 11 which also comprises a detection sytem 13. With an electron beam 14, to be emitted by the cathode, a specimen16 arranged on the specimen carrier can be irradiated and radiation due to interaction with the specimen can be detected. In a scanning electron microscope the specimen is scanned by the electron beam and transmitted, reflected and or secondary electrons or other radiation generated by interaction between the electron beam and the object can be detected by the detector sytem 16 to which a television monitor, not shown in the drawing, is connected. As appears from the Figure, the anode is structurally integral with the cathode Wehnelt cylinder unit so that the anode can be very accurately positioned with respect to the cathode Wehnelt cylinder unit in the radial as well as the axial direction. Fig. 2 shows an embodiment for an electron gun comprising an integrated anode therein, the filament 1 with an emissive spot 32 and the Wehnelt cylinder 2 with a Wehnelt aperture 34 are accomodated in a bush This construction allows for extremely exact positioning of the Wehnelt cylinder bore 34 and the anode 52 with respect to one another. Both bores will usually be spherical and oriented so as to be concentric with the optical axis. To this end, the Wehnelt bore has a diameter of, for example approximately 0.5 mm. The anode bore can be adapted to the relevant requirements and has a diameter of, for example, from 10 to 250 µm. This method of mounting results in a suitably breakdown resistant anode construction, whilst any problems due to creepage leaks can be eliminated, if necessary, by re arranging electrical creepage paths b the provision of additional recesses in the insulating bush 46. In addition to achieving optimum mutual adjustment of the Wehnelt cylinder bore and the anode bore, the integrated construction is also extremely suitable for achieving comparatively small, well defined distances between the anode plate 52 and a grid plate 33. Notably in apparatus for, for example measurements on insulating surfaces such as of specimens for integrated circuits and the like where comparatively low anode voltages are used, a small but well defined Wehnelt cylinder anode distance is very important in order to obtain a high brightness. This construction allows for distances of less than 1 mm. When a more pronounced cup shape is imparted to the Wehnelt cylinder or the anode plate, the length of the intermediate piece 46 may still remain comparatively large, so that the occurence of electrical creepage leaks is still avoided. Because the mutual adjustment can now be so accurately performed and the bores can be aligned with respect to one another with a tolerance of less than 10 µm, use can now be made of an anode bore which also serves as a beam aperture. Edge rays of the beam can be intercepted by such an aperture bore so that the virtual object for the electron beam is electron optically enhanced. When the anode aperture also functions as beamstop the beam reduction after the anode results in a strong reduction of mutual interactions of the electrons in the beam as well in the travellling direction as in a direction in the cross section of the beam. Thus the negative influence of the Boersch effect and beam spread is strongly reduced resulting in a chromatic beam with a high brightness. In an embodiment as shown in Fig. 2 the anode is constructed to be double and comprises, in addition to the already described anode plate 51 with the anode bore 52, a second anode bush 54 with an aperture 56 which may be comparatively larger with respect to the anode bore 52 and which does not serve as an aperture but solely as an electron lens. The first anode bore 52 can now perform or combine each of the said functions. For a pierce like gun,
