# SHIELDED CABLE TERMINATION AND APPARATUS AND COMPONENTS THEREFOR

## Abstract
Apparatus for terminating an elongate, insulatively jacket ed, shielded cable of type having a signal conductor and a drain wire, includes a member for receiving said cable therein and compressible onto the received cable to resist mutual longitudi nal movement therebetween, the member providing longitudi nal shielding for the cable, permitting passage of the signal con ductor therethrough and defining exterior surface for disposi tion of the drain wire. A connector housing defines a channel for retentively receiving the compressible member with the ca ble therein, the housing including a deformable wall bounding the channel and responsive to deforming force applied thereto both for compressing the compressible member onto the cable and for electrically interconnecting the drain wire and the hous ing.
