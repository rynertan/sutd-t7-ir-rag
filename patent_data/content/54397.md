# Process for preparing esters of penicillanic acid sulfone.

## Abstract
A process for preparing halomethyl esters of penicillanic acid sulfone, intermediates to betalactamase inhibitors, from the corresponding substituted thiomethyl and sulfinylmethyl esters and a halogenating agent. The thiomethyl and sulfinylmethyl esters of penicillanic acid sulfone are useful intermediates.
