## Description
Battery charger The present invention relates to a device with electric.circuits which are at least in part supplied by rechargeable batteries, including first means for the recharge of these batteries with substantially steady current, second means allowing the flow of charging current starting a recharging cycle of the batteries only if their voltage is lower than a first preset threshold, third means producing the interruption of the charging current stopping the recharging cycle when the batteries voltage exceeds a second preset threshold. Much of the electric equipment currently being used is powered either entirely or partly by d.c. current. In the case of non portable electrical equipment, i e. equipment permanently used where it can be connected to an a.c.electricity mains, the problem is overcome by fitting the equipment with suitable power units for converting 220 V a.c. current into d.c. current of the required voltage and power. In the case of portable electrical equipment, however, i.e.television sets, radios, recorders, calculating machines, etc., which may be used where no electricity supply is available, or equipment or parts of it which, though they may be operated from an electricity supply e.g. remote controls , require frequent handling in which case a supply cable would be awkward the problem is overcome by fitting the equipment with dry cells. Particularly when the equipment is operated continually, however, these cells run down fairly rapidly and have to be replaced frequently at great expense to the user. Furthermore, certain types of portable equipment, e.g.recorders, telecameras, etc., require a more or less constant supply voltage throughout the recording or filming operation to ensure good recording or filming quality, whereas dry cells do not maintain constant voltage during discharge. All these problems are successfully overcome by using rechargeable nickel cadmium batteries which, besides providing for low running cost and greater working life, maintain a discharge voltage more constant than dry cells. Rechargeable batteries, however, have to be recharged after they have run down, and can only be recharged a certain number of times and must be recharged very carefully if efficient operation and long life of the batteries are to be ensured. Makers of nickel cadmium batteries currently available on the market guarantee roughly 500 complete recharging operations and roughly twice this number of partial recharging operations provided recharging operations are performed using steady current equivalent to roughly 1 10 of charge capacity and the batteries are not overcharged during the recharging operation. The drawbacks of battery rechargers currently available on the market is that when and how long batteries are recharged is left to the discretion of the user who invariably either under or overcharges them, either case resulting in improper use. If overcharged, batteries may be damaged irreparably by leaking electrolyte, whereas undercharging reduces the operating time and working life of the batteries. It is also known see issued Dutch patent application no. 10 8006508 by Krijnen a device for recharging the batteries capable to sense two thresholds, one at the beginning and the other at the end of the charge, so to supply a charge current only when the voltage of the battery to be recharged has reached the typical discharge value and stop the recharge only when the voltage of the battery has reached the typical charge end value. Therefore such device allows a right charge of rechargeable batteries, only in case these ones are never disconnected from the device, i.e. only in case of rechargeable batteries used inside an equipment as a backup . In fact in case batteries have to be temporarily disconnected from recharge circuit, according to the particular use of the device supplied by the batteries remote controls, portable computers, little household appliances, etc. , after a charging cycle usually lasting several hours has begun but not completed the device described in the said Dutch patent application, when reconnected cannot start to recharge again as expected, for due to the disconnection the voltage reached the end of charge value and will not start again till the voltage at the battcry terminals does not fall down he typical value of a discharged battery. Thus the recharge cycle has not been completed and one of the limited recharge cycles available has not been correctly used No one of the known devices cannot memorize the charge status of the battery should it be disconnected during recharging and then reconnected to the charger. The aim of the present invention is therefore to overcome these drawbacks by providing a battery charger designed to ensure complete recharging, i.e. which only commences recharging when the batteries are run down and only stops when the batteries are fully charged, regardless of the initial status of charge on the batteries, how often the batteries are connected to or disconnected from the charger and how long they are kept connected provided, of course, the total time does not exceed that required for recharging . With these aims in view, the present invention relates to a device with electric circuits which are at least in part supplied by rechargeable batteries, including first means for the recharge of these batteries with substantially steady current, second means allowing the flow of charging current starting a recharging cycle of batteries only if their voltage is lower than a first preset threshold, third weans producing the interruption of the charging current stopping the recharging cycle when the batteries voltage exceeds a second preset threshold, characterized in that memory means are provided, to memorize in case of a possible disconnection of these batteries from the device, the batteries recharge was completed or not and consequently allow or not to start recharge again on the new insertion, also in case the batteries voltage is over the first preset threshold. The invention will now be described with reference to the attached drawings, given only as an informative and a non limiting example, in which Fig. 1 shows charging and discharging graphs of a rechargeable battery as a function of time Fig. 2 shows the electric circuit of a part of a first embodiment of the present invention Fig. 3 shows the electric circuit of a second embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 1 showing the charging a and discharging b graphs of a rechargeable 9 V nickel cadmium battery, the battery can be said to be fully charged over the 10.5 V mark and discharged below the 7.5 V mark, both of which threshold can easily be determined to a good degree of accuracy. Fig. 2 showing the electric circuit of a part of a first embodiment of the present invention shows a resistor lj with one terminal connected to a positive 18 V supply V and the other connected to a side terminal of potentiometer 2. The other side terminal of potentiometer 2 is connected to one end of resistor 3, the other end of which is grounded, and the middle terminal of the potentiometer is connected to one end of resistor 4. The other end of resistor 4 is connected to the non inverting input of a voltage threshold comparator 5 and to one end of resistor 6. The other end of resistor 6 is connected to the output of voltage comparator 5 and to one end of resistor 7, the other end of which is connected to supply V. The output of voltage comparator 5 is also connected to one end of resistor 8, the other end of which is connected to the base of PNP transistor 9. The collector of transistor 9 is connected to one end of resistor 10, the other end of which is connected to supply V, while the emitter is connected to the anode of semiconductor diode 11.The cathode of diode 11 is connected to one end of resistor 12, the other etnd of which is connected to the inverting input of voltage comparator 5, and to a first terminal on terminal board 13 to which the positive pole of the rechargeable battery is connected. The second terminal on terminal board 13, to which the negative pole of the rechargeable battery is connected, is grounded.For a clear understanding of how the charger works, it should first be pointed out that resistor 10 is selected so that roughly 10 12 mA the charge current recommended by the battery maker flows through the branch the rechargeable battery is connected to, that resistor 1 and 3 and potentiometer 2 are selected so that the reference voltage of the non inverting terminal of voltage threshold comparator 5 is roughly 7.5 V and the resistor 4 and 6 are selected so as to provide for 3 V hysteresis. If the voltage of the battery connected to the charger is over 7.5 V, the output of voltage threshold comparator 5 is low, transistor 9 is disabled and no current flows into the battery to charge it. If, on the other hand, its voltage is below 7.5 V, the output of voltage threshold comparator 5 is high, transistor 9 is saturated and charge current flows into the battery. At the same time, part of the output voltage is sent back to the non inverting input of voltage threshold comparator 5 to raise its threshold to 10.5 V. Current continues to flow into the battery which rises in voltage as it is charged. When the said voltage exceeds 10.5 V, the output of voltage threshold comparator 5 switches, transistor 9 is disabled and current is cut off to stop charging the battery which can thus be left connected to terminal board 13 for any lenght of time with no danger of being overcharged. The described device may be successfully connected to a control unit bearing a micro processor. The control unit may be placed inside the device for carrying out other functions, with the task of checking the working conditions of the recharge device, memorize it and start the charge again in case the battery is taken off temporarily before the end of the recharge operation. The aim of this operation is to carry out always complete recharge cycles, allowing to obtain the life of the batteries the longest possible. In such a realization the control unit can receive a signal from the cathode of diode 11, from which it gets an information both about the working conditions during recharge or not, and about the connection of the battery to the positive and negative pin. Besides it can send a signal to the negative pin of threshold voltage comparator 5 which can eventually compel the comparator to recharge, quite apart from the value of the voltage at the battery ends, in case the battery is connected another time to the positive and negative pins after an interruption in a non completed recharge cycle. In the example shown, a 9 V battery is charged but different voltage and or capacities can be catered for by adjusting the values of resistor 1, 3, 4, G and 10, potentiometer 2 and the threshold of comparator 5. In an alternative arrangement, provision can be made for a set of resistors 1, 3, 4, 6 and 10 and potentiometer 2 with a switch device for charging batteries of various voltages and or capacities.

The other end of the latter is connected to one end of resistor 25 the other end of which is connected to an 18V positive d.c. supply V . The middle terminal of first potentiometer 22 is connected to the non inverting input of a first voltage threshold comparator with hysteresis 26 which is also connected to one end of resistor 27 the other end of which is connected to the output of the said voltage comparator 26. The inverting output of first voltage comparator 26 is connected to the junction of condenser 28, the other end of which is grounded, and resistor 29, the other end of which is connected to the non inverting input of a second voltage threshold comparator with hysteresis 30 . The inverting input of second voltage comparator 30, on the other end, is connected to the middle terminal of second potentiometer 23. The output of first voltage comparator 26 is connected to one end of resistor 31, the other end of which is connected to supply V, and to one end of resistor 32.The other end of the latter is connected to one end of condenser 33, the other end of which is connected to supply V, and to the SET input of a SET RESET flip flop 34 The input of second voltage comparator 30 is connected to one end of resistor 35, the other end of which is connected to supply V, and to one end of resistor 36. The other end of the latter is connected to the anode of semiconductor diode 37, to the positive terminal of electrolytic condenser 38, the negative terminal of which is grounded, and to the reset input of flip flop 34. The complemented output Q of flip flop 34 is connected to one end of resistor 39, the other end of which is connected to the anode of Zener diode 40, and to the base of PRIP transistor 41. The cathode of Zener diode 40 is connected to supply 7 and to one end of resistor 42, the other end of which is connected to the emitter of transistor 41. The collector of the latter is connected to one end of resistor 43, the other end of which is grounded, to the anode of diode 44 and to the anode of LED 45. The cathode of LED 45 is connected to a first terminal on terminal board 46 to which the positive pole of the rechargeable battery is connected the second terminal of which for connecting the negative pole of the discharged battery is grounded. The first terminal on terminal board 46 is connected to one end of resistor 47 and to the cathode of diode 48. The other end of resistor 47 and the anode of diode 48 are connected together, to the inverting input of first voltage comparator 26. The cathode of diode 44, connected parallel to resistor 49, is connected to the positive pole of electrolytic condenser 50, the negative pole of which is grounded, and to the inverting input of a third voltage threshold comparator with hysteresis 51 . The non inverting input of third comparator 51 is connected to the junction of resistor 24 and 25 and to one end of resistor 51, the other end of which is connected to the output of the same comparator 51. The same output of third comparator 51 is connected to the cathode of diode 37 and to one ezid of resistor 53, the other end of which is connected to supply V. For a clear understanding of how the circuit works, it should be pointed out that resistor 21,24 and 25 and potentiometers 22 and 23 are selected so that for a 9 V battery the threshold on the first 26 , second 30 and third 51 voltage comparators are 7.5V,10.5 V and 13 V respectively and that resistors 36, 47 and 49 and condensers 38 and 50 are selected so that the trailing edges of the input voltage on third comparator 51 are steeper than those at the inputs of first and second comparators 26 and 30, so that the output pulses of third comparator 51 are supplied in advance of those on first and second comparators 26 and 30. If the voltage of the battery connected to terminal board 46 is below 7.5 V, first comparator 26 switches its outputs which was low a SET signal is sent to flip flop 34, the complemented outputs of which switches to low, and the current generator, consisting of resistors 39 and 42, Zener diode 40 and transistor 41, starts to supply current. The battery begins to charge and LED 45 lights up to show the user the battery is being charged. Charging continues until the voltage on the battery reaches 10.5 V at which point the second comparator 30 switches its output to high, a RESIT signal is sent to flip flop 34, the complemented output of which switches to high, and transistor 41 cuts off supply to the battery which may thus be left connected for any lenght of time with no fear of being overcharged. As the battery ages, it may take a long time for it to reach 10.5 V shown by LED 45 so that it may prove useful to lower the second threshold slightly. For this purpose, potentiometer 23 may be made accessible to the user. If, on the other hand, the voltage of the rechargeable. battery connected to the charger is over 7.5 V, first comparator 26 does not switch its output, no SET pulse is sent to flip flop 34 and the battery is not charged. If, by any chance, the battery is disconnected from the terminal board 46 during the charge operation, the collector on transistor 41 switches immediately to supply voltage V which, via branch 44, 49, is sent to the inverting output ofcthird comparator 51 and, via branch 29, 47, to the non inverting input of second comparator 30. As already stated, the branch leading to third comparator 51 enables the pulses to travel faster than the one leading to second comparator 30 so that the output of third comparator 51 usually high switches to low before the output of second comparator 30 switches to high. In this way, the positive pulse on second comparator 30 is detoured through diode 37 and no RESET pulse is sent to flip flop 34. Having received no RESET pulse1 the charger thus remains set for completing the charge on the battery when the latter is connected again to terminal board 46. In other words, when the battery is disconnected from terminal board 46, the charger remembers whether it was fully charged or not and, in the event it was not, completes the charge regardless of how many times the battery has been connected or disconnected. The means used in this case memorize voltage attainment but provision could equally well be made for a time memory, i.e. a device which charges the battery for a set lenght of time either in one go or at separate intervals. The device described could safely be fitted on a portable electronic set with the batteries left in permanently and would operate exactly as described. The only provision required would be to replace the volatile memory described with a non volatile one which preserves the stored data when the appliance is disconnected from the mains and supply cut off to the circuit. On the circuit described, condenser 33 sends a SET signal to flip flop 34 to enable charging whenever the circuit is supplied so as to prevent random operation of the charger in the event of accidental power failure. The present charger is particularly useful on remote controlled television sets or audio equipment powered by rechargeable batteries. In this case, the charger is placed inside the appliance which also has a compartment for the remote control and a terminal board which, together with plugs on the remote control, enables the batteries inside the remote control to be charged by the charger inside the television set whenever the remote control is replaced. As the remote control may be taken out of the compartment before the battery has been fully charged, it is even more important that the charger should be provided with memory means. As already shown with regard to the embodiment shown in fig. 2, the device with the abovesaid type of operations can be achieved using programmed logic, e.g. using part of a microprocessor programme if the appliance the charger is fitted on already provides for one. As shown in the fig. 2 circuit, batteries with voltage and or capacities other than those described may also be charged by adjusting the resistors determining charge threshold and current. In yet another alternative arrangement, provision can be made for several sets of similar resistors with a switch for charging batteries with different voltages and or capacities.
