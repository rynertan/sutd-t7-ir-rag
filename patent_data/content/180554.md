## Description
Method of assembling motor vehicle bodies for the production of bodies of different types and a body obtained by this method.The present invention relates to a method of assembling motor vehicle bodies.In the production of unitized bodies for cars, the technique of using a standard chassis for different bodies in the same family of car is already known. For example, the chassis of a saloon car is also used for a sports model of the car and or a model for industrial use.Normally, these standard chassis are formed by the floor of the body and the lower side structures fixed thereto. Sometimes the structure is completed in correspondence with the engine compartment with lateral framework and covering structures which extend halfway up the car.The object of the invention is to achieve a method of assembly usable for the production of bodies of different types for example, twobay, three bay and estate versions,perhaps with different rear overhangs , which is as simple and flexible as possible and, in particular, permits the assembly equipment to be adapted easily and rapidly to each new type of body which is put into production.According to the principle characteristic of the invention, there are prearranged a standard type of floor and sides forming a single pre assembled space structure a three dimensional frame of reticulated structure common to all types of body, and a series of different types of subassembly for completing the structure, which can be assembled with the latter in Ã…a second step to produce the different types of body.The pre assembled space structure is distinguished from the standard frames of the prior art in that it also includes the sides of the car, the windscreen frame and any cross members interconnecting the sides.According to a further characteristic, at least a part of each subassembly for completing the body comprises a bottom wall and two side walls for the completion of the floor and the sides of the pre assembled structure.In one embodiment, the subassemblies for completing the pre assembled structure are used to complete the rear part of the body. In this case, each completing subassembly also includes a rear wall for the completion of the body.The invention will now be described with reference to the appended drawings, provided purely by way of non limiting example, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of the body module used in the method according to the invention Figure 2 is an exploded perspective view of the module of Figure 1, showing the subassemblies which make up this module Figures3 to 7 are perspective views illustrating five different types of subassembly for completing the body module, and Figure 8 illustrates three different types of roof corresponding to the various types of body to be assembled.In the embodiment illustrated in the appended drawings, the method according to the invention is used to assemble different types of body corresponding to different versions of the same model of body two bay, three bay and estate versions . In this case, the different types of body to be assembled are substantially similar to each other as regards the framework of the front and central parts of the body but differ in the rear part, while, for stylistic reasons, the visible parts forming parts of the subassemblies for completion of the completing and finishing panels may or may not differ.According to the method of the present invention, all the aforesaid different types of body are assembled from a pre assembled space structure 1, shown in Figure 1, which is common to all the types of body. The structure 1 is made up essentially of a floor 2 see Figure 2 which is standard to all the different types of body, two sides 3 only the right hand side is illustrated in Figure 2 which are also standard for all the different types of body, and an element 4b for connecting the two sides 3. Figure 2 also illustrates the support frame 4 for the windscreen, which is also standard for all the different types of body.As mentioned, Figure 2 illustrates only the main subassemblies of the structure 1.Figures 3 to 7 illustrate five different types of subassembly for completion of the structure 1.The subassembly illustrated in Figure3 generally indicated 5 corresponds to the two bay version of the model of body, and comprises a rear part 6 and two small side walls 7 having frontal flanges 6a, 7a intended to be carried by corresponding flanges 6b, 7b on the rear part of the body module 1. As mentioned, the assembly of the subassembly 5 on the rear part of the structure 1 allows a two bay version of the body to be produced.The three bay version, however, is produced by assembling the subassembly generally indicated 8 in Figure 4 on the rear part of the body module 1.This subassembly comprises a bottom wall 9 for completion of the floor 2 of the structure 1, two side walls 10 for completion of the sides 3 of the structure 1, and a rear part 11.Figure 5 illustrates a variant of the subassembly 8, which differs from the subassembly shown inFigure 4 only in that is has a different configuration of the rear wall 11.Figure 6 illustrates a subassembly 12 corresponding to the estate version of the model of body, comprising a bottom wall 13 for completion of the floor 2 of the body module 1, two side walls 14 for completion of the sides 3 of the body module 1, a rear wall 15, and an auxiliary cross member 16 which connects two upper longitudinal members 16a forming parts of the side walls 14.Finally, Figure 7 shows a variant of the subassembly illustrated in Figure 3, which differs from the latter substantially in that it has a different configuration of the side walls 7.Figure 8 illustrates three different types of roof 17, 18, 19 corresponding to the different types of body. The roof 17 is designed for the estate version obtainable by assembling the subassembly 12 on the body module 1. The roof 18 is used in the case of assembly of the module 1 with the subassembly 8 of the type illustrated in Figure 4 or Figure 5. Lastly, the roof 19 corresponds to the use of the subassembly 5 illustrated in Figure 3 or the subassembly 5 illustrated in Figure 7. Once a predetermined type of body has been assembled, the latter is completed by conventional techniques, with the addition of external finishing panels. From the foregoing description, it is evident that the method according to the invention permits the flexibility of the system of production to be improved significantly, in that it allows the assembly equipment to be adapted easily and rapidly if it is desired to put a new type of body into production.The storage of the components intended to make up the body is also simplified, in that a predominant part of the body is constituted by standard elements of the same shape and size for all the different types of body.Naturally, whilst the principle of the invention remains the same, the details of construction and forms of embodiment may be varied widely from that described and illustrated purely by way of example, without thereby departing from the scope of the present invention.
