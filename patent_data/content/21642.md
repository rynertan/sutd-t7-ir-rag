# Modified petroleum resins and their preparation.

## Abstract
Carboxyl modified petroleum resins suitable as resins in inks for off set printing are obtained by heating cyclopentadiene or a comparable monomer with 1 to 15 wt. of a carboxylic acid which is not alpha beta, unsaturated at from 270 C to 290 C under sufficient pressure to keep the mixture liquid.
