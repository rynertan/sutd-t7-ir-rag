# PROCESS FOR PREPARING ALPHA L ASPARTYL L PHENYLALANINE METHYL ESTER

## Abstract
A process for preparing α L aspartyl L phenylalanine methyl ester consisting of bringing N formyl L aspartic anhydride and L phenylalanine methyl ester, in a molar ratio equal or approximately equal to 1 1, into contact with a solid cation exchange resin having free sulphonic, phosphonic or car boxylic acid groups, the ratio of the acid equivalents of said resin acid groups to the number of moles of the one or other reagent being equal to or less than about 1 1, and operating in the liquid phase in an inert organic solvent at a temperature of about 40 C or less, until a mixture of N formyl α L aspartyl L phenylalanine methyl ester and N formyl β L aspartyl L phenylalanine methyl ester forms in which the α isomer prevails over the β isomer deformylating said N formyl α L aspartyl L phenylalanine methyl ester and N formyl β L aspartyl L phenylalanine methyl ester and separating and recovering the a L aspartyl L phenylalanine methyl ester from said deformylated products.
