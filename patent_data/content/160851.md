# Medium for lysine decarboxylation test.

## Abstract
A medium for lysine decarboxylation test comprises 1 to 10 g of yeast extract, 1 to 10 g of peptone, 0.1 to 2 g of glucose, 0.2 to 2 g of monoalkali metal dihydrogen phos phate, 5 to 50 g of L lysine mineral acid salt, 0.005 to 0.1 g of 5 pyridoxalphosphoric ester, and 0.01 to 0.2 g of a pH indicator, and has a pH value in the range of 5.5 to 6.5 when dissovled in 1 liter of water.
