# Catalytic dewaxing of hydrocarbon oils.

## Abstract
An improved process for catalytically dewaxing a hydrocarbon oil is disclosed. In this process the waxy oil is contacted in the presence of hydrogen with a dense zeolitic dewaxing catalyst associated with a nickel tungsten hydrogenation component. The dewaxed oil has unexpectedly good stability and a low bromine number compared with oils processed with prior art catalyst. The process may be used to dewax crude oil, fuel oil fractions and lubricating oils.
