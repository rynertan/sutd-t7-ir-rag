# A METHOD OF FORMING A LAMINATED PRODUCT

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of and apparatus for forming a laminated product, for example a laminated trim panel in a motor vehicle. The laminated product comprises a number of plies 2, 4, 6 and is formed by compressing the plies 2, 4, 6 together between two moulds 14, 16 of a press. The plies 2, 4, 6 are held at their edges during their passage to and from the press by means of spikes 32 extending from chains or belts 30 . In a preferred embodiment the upper mould 14 is held stationary during the moulding process, the lower mould 16 being moved upwardly to effect compression.
