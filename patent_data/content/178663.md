## Description
The present invention relates to an internal combustion engine according to the preamble of claim 1. Such a combustion engine is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application First Provisional Publication 59 105925. Similar combustion engines are disclosed in Sho59 93926 and 59 105926. These references disclose a prior art multi inlet valve type engine which is shown in figure 1. In these arrangements two inlet valves 1, 2 and one exhaust valve 3, are arranged to control the communication between the induction and exhaust systems and each combustion chamber. However, these arrangements encounter the problem that when the engine temperature is low and or the engine is idling, the fuel passing through the induction system tends to be poorly carburetted and the air fuel mixture contains a large amount of unvaporized liquid fuel. Accordingly, as the inlet valve 2 is opened before valve 3 by a suitable valve train under such conditions and the section 5 of the bifurcate or so called siamesed port 6 which is associated with valve 2 is designed to direct the flow of air fuel mixture into the combustion chamber in a manner to swirl therearound, the liquid fuel contained in the charge tend to carried toward and impinge on the electrodes of the spark plug 6. This of course wets the plug and hampers efficient ignition of the air fuel mixture, destablizes engine operation and invites notable increases in HC emissions under such conditions. It is an object of the present invention to provide a bifurcate induction port arrangement for an internal combustion engine which obivates the wetting of the spark plug by imparting a velocity on the liquid fuel which tend to have a relatively high inertia which velocity carries same along a flight path which is non intersective with the spark plug. This object is solved by the features of the characterising part of claim 1. In brief, in the embodiments of the present invention a passage which is adapted to produce a swirl in the combustion chamber is arranged so that the liquid fuel which passes therethrough enters the combustion chamber with a velocity which carries same along a flight path non intersective with the plug electrodes. More specifically, the present invention takes the form of an internal combustion engine which has a combustion chamber, first and second inlet valves, an exhaust valve and a spark plug and which is characterized by a bifurcate intake port having a main section with an entrance adapted to communicate with an induction system and first and second branch passages which lead from the main section to the first and second inlet valves, respectively, the first branch passage being arranged to guide the air fuel mixture entering the main section in a manner that liquid fuel which has a relatively high inertia is compared with the remaining air fuel charge is caused to have a velocity which leads it along a flight path which is non intersective with the spark plug. The present invention will become more clearly appreciated from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which Figs. 2 and 3 show a first embodiment of the present invention. In this arrangement a cylinder head 10 is formed with a plurality of combustion chamber defining recesses 12 and bifurcate or siamesed intake ports 14. As shown in Fig. 2, each of the bifurcate intake ports 14 communicates with an induction manifold 16. The cylinder head 10 is also formed with a plurality of exhaust ports 18 which are adapted to communicate with an exhaust manifold not shown . As best seen in Fig. 3 each of the bifurcate intake ports 14 includes first and second branch passages 20, 22. Communication between the branches 20, 22 and the combustion chamber is controlled by first and second valves 24, 26 respectively. Communication between each of the exhaust ports 18 and the combustion chamber is controlled by an exhaust valve 28. A spark plug 30 is arranged to be threadedly received in a bore formed in the cylinder head in a manner to project into the combustion chamber. The first embodiment of the present invention overcomes the vetting problem encountered with the prior art by configuring the bifurcate intake port 14 so that branch 20 is essentially alinged with the branch runner of the induction or intake manifold 16 and the exhaust port 18 as seen in plan and so that other branch 22 deviates from the direction in which the air fuel mixture enters the bifurcate port 14 from the induction manifold runner at an angle which causes the liquid fuel flowing therethrough in the form of a film on the passage walls to have a velocity which carries it along a flight path such as shown by the flow arrow which is non intersective with the electrodes of the spark plug. In order to achieve the above phenomenon, it has been discovered that if branch 22 is arranged with respect to the position of the spark plug 30 so that the spark plug 30 lies within a sector defined between a theoretical line A which lies on the lower face of the cylinder head 10 and which is essentially normal to the plane on which the mouth of port 14 lies, and a line B which intersects line A at the level where the bifurcation of the induction port begins and which extends along essentially parallel to the inboard edge of branch 22 as seen in plan the width of branch 22 is W and length thereof taken along line A is 1 the displacement of center of the spark plug 30 from line B is h and the width of the plug itself is d and if the above mentioned dimensions are selected so that the ratio of h d is greater than or equal to 1.0 and the ratio of 1 W is equal to or greater than 0.8 then, without loss of engine performance the liquid fuel will enter the combustion chamber with a horizontal velocity component viz., a component which is parallel to a plane normal to the cylinder bore axis which induces same to follow a trajectory or flight path which by passes the zone of spark plug. Viz., as shown in the graphs of Figs. 4 and 5, if the h d ratio is held constant at a value of 1.5 and the ratio of 1 W is varied, at a 1 W value 0.8 the wetting of the spark plug 30 decreases toward an essentially constant value while if the ratio of 1 W is held constant at a value of 1.0 and the ration of h d is varied, then at a h d value of 1.0 the wetting phenomenon drops off to an essentially constant value. Figs. 6 to 8 show a second embodiment of the present invention. In this arrangement the arrangement of the intake port is essentially the same as that of the first embodiment and differs in that the passages 20 and 22 are arranged to have cross sections of the nature shown in Figs. 7 and 8. It has been found that by flattening the walls of the branch sections 20 and 22 as shown, the flow of liquid fuel film along the walls of the branches tends to vary in manner which further improves the directing of the fuel away from the spark plug location.
