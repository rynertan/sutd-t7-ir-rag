# Continuous coating of webs having spliced joints.

## Abstract
Method for the continuous coating of webs having spliced joints, which avoids at high coating speeds coating defects that are caused by the web joints in coaters that are closely spaced from the webs. The webs 10 and 17 are spliced by means of a tape 16 that runs from the front side of the old web to the rear side of the new web, whereby only step up discontinuities are formed a the splicing joint. The method is in particular valuable in the manufacturing of delicate materials, such as photographic light sensitive film.
