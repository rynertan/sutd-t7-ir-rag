# Pneumatic granular or seed applicator.

## Abstract
The invention is a pneumatic granular or seed applicator for fertilizer, herbicides or seeds and it includes a vertically situated auger assembly 10, 11, 12 which is connected to the source of the material to be distributed. A distribution casing 13 surrounds the upper discharge end of the auger assembly and blades or vanes 17 are secured to the upper end of the auger shaft to radially distribute the material augered by the auger assembly, outwardly of the distribution casing. Discharge collars 21 are situated around the base of the distribution casing and convey the material to discharge conduits 23 which are conventional and which lead to the normal distribution heads and discharge devices 55 . Air under pressure passes through venturi 27 and assists in picking up the material from the discharge collars and conveys it to the various discharge conduits and thence to the individual ground engaging applicators, which are conventional. The assembly ensures a more even distribu tion of the material being distributed, and as the speed of rotation of the auger assembly can be controlled within limits, the device is well suited for use with a plurality of different materials.
