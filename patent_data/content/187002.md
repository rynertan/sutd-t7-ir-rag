# Synthesis of crystalline aluminum, phosphates.

## Abstract
A microporous crystalline aluminum phosphate having the X ray diffraction characteristics substantially corresponding to those set forth in Table 1 is prepared by crystallization from an aqueous reaction mixture comprising sources of Al2O3, P2O5, and urea or a substituted urea of the formula R1R2N.CO.NR3R4 where R1, R2, R3 and R4 are the same or different and each is hydrogen or a C1 12 hydrocarbyl group.
