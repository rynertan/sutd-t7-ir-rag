# A striker mechanism for a high speed serial printer.

## Abstract
A striker mechanism for a high speed serial printer, for example of the daisy wheel type, includes a hammer 21 mov able axially towards the platen 13 under the action of an electro magnet whose armature carries a striker 79, and against the action of a return spring 48. Two lubricating felt pads 55 are arranged on opposite sides with respect to the striker hammer 21 and are pressed against the hammer by the grip of a spring 63 for damping the hammer vibrations during the printing cycle. The armature comprises a pivoted lever which is damped with respect to its pivot by means of a felt washer and the lever is damped on return by a helical spring 82 on a rod 83 with a reduced diameter centre section where it is struck by a pad 81 on the lever.
