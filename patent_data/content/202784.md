## Description
This invention relates to a silver halide photographic light sensitive material containing negative type silver halide grains each having an inner core substantially comprising silver bromide or silver iodobromide surrounded by a plurality of outer shells each substantially composed of silver bromide or silver iodobromide. In recent years, as there have been more stringent requirements for silver halide emulsions for photographic use, the demands for high level photographic characteristics such as a high speed, an excellent graininess, a high sharpness, a low fog density, and a sufficiently wide exposure range have increased. High speed emulsions such as a silver iodobromide emulsion containing silver iodide in an amount of from 0 to 10 mol of the emulsion to satisfy the above mentioned requirements are known. As regards the methods of preparing the above mentioned emulsions, the well known methods include, for example, an ammonia method, a neutral method, an acid method in which the conditions of pH and pAg values are controlled, and a precipitation method such as a single jet or double jet method. Based upon the above mentioned prior art research has been carried out with the intention of improving the sensitivity and graininess of light sensitive materials and, further, achieving both high sharpness and low fog. A silver iodobromide emulsion which is provided by the invention has been studied so as to control not only the crystal habits and grain distribution but also the iodide content distribution in an individual silver halide grain. To achieve the photographic characteristics including, for example, a high speed, excellent graininess, high sharpness or low log density, the most conventional process is to improve the quantum efficiency of the silver halide used. For this purpose, studies have been made of solid state physics and the like. There has been research in which the above mentioned quantum efficiency was theoretically computed and the influence on a graininess distribution was also studied. Such research is described in, for example, the preprints of 1980 Tokyo Symposium on Photographic Progress, titled Interactions Between Light and Materials , p. 91. This research predicts that a quantum efficiency could effectively be improved if a monodispersed emulsion may be prepared by narrowing a grain distribution. Further, in the so called chemical sensitization process for sensitizing a silver halide emulsion This process will be described in detail later. , it may be reasonably presumed that a monodispersed emulsion may also be advantageous to effectively make a light sensitive material highly sensitive whilst maintaining a low fog level. To prepare such a monodispersed emulsion on an industrial scale, it is desired, as described in Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public Inspection hereinafter called Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 48521 1979, to apply both of the theoretically predetermined conditions of the feeding rate controls of silver ions and halide ions to be fed into a reaction system and the satisfactory conditions of the agitation thereof to the preparation process under the strict controls of the pAg and pH values of the emulsion. When a silver halide emulsion is prepared under the above mentioned conditions, it is in either the cubic, octahedral or tetradecahedral crystal form. Such an emulsion comprises the so called normal crystal grains each having both of the 100 and 111 planes in various ratios. It is well known that a high sensitization may be achieved by making use of the above mentioned normal crystal grains. It is known that the silver halide emulsions suitably used in high speed photographic films include a silver iodobromide emulsion comprising polydispersed type twinned crystal grains. Also, silver iodobromide emulsions each containing tabular shaped twinned crystal grains are disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 113927 1983 and others. Additionally Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 22408 1978 Japanese Patent Examined Publication No. 13162 1968 Journal of Photographic Science , No. 24, p. 198, 1976 and the like each describe, respectively, that development activity is increased or high sensitization is realized by making use of multilayered type silver halide grains applied with a plurality of shells around the inner cores of the grains. Furthermore, West German Patent No. 2,932.650 Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos. 2417 1976, 17436 1976 and 11927 1977 and the like describe the respective silver halide grains each provided with a covering layer by a halogen substitution so as to serve as the outermost layer of the silver halide grain. These silver halide grains are not suitable for a negative type emulsion, because the fixing time is reduced. Also, development may be thereby inhibited, so that satisfactory sensitivity may not be obtained. There is also well known positive type i.e., an internal latent image type silver halide grains each provided outside the inner core thereof with a plurality of covering layers prepared through a halogen substitution, such as those described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 2,592,250 and 4,075,020 and Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 127549 1980. These silver halide grains are often used in an internal latent image type direct positive light sensitive material such as those for diffusion transferring use. However, they cannot be used at all in any negative type emulsion to which the invention directed, because the internal sensitivity thereof is excessively high. There is a further silver halide grain provided on the inner core thereof with shells, as described above, and in which various iodide contents of the respective layers thereof are taken into account. This type of grains are described in, for example, Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication nos. 181037 1983, 35726 1985 and 116647 1984. DE A 3310609 discloses a silver halide photographic material comprising silver halide grains provided with iodobromide grains having an average iodide content of at least 12 mol . The grains comprise at least 3 different iodobromide phases, each having a different iodide content. Whilst the precise relative iodide content of the layers is not critical, the external phase preferably has an average iodide content of between 5 and 13 mol percent of the average content of the entire grain the second phase preferably contains between 15 and 25 mol percent and the innermost phase preferably has a content of between 30 and 70 mol percent. In the field of silver halide photographic light sensitive materials, color light sensitive materials each having an ISO speed of 1000 or over have recently been introduced. It is, however, usual that as such a light sensitive material shows improved sensitivity, it deteriorates in terms of graininess and sharpness. Accordingly, such a high speed light sensitive material has, so far been unsatisfactory for the consumers who want to admire a good photograph because its image quality is not as good as a conventional light sensitive material. Therefore, a high speed negative type light sensitive material excellent in graininess and image sharpness is required. For astronomical photography, indoor photography, sport photography and the like, a further high speed negative type light sensitive material is particularly called for. The present invention seeks to provide a negative type silver halide photographic light sensitive material which is high in sensitivity, excellent in the correlation between sensitivity and fog, wide in the exposure range, and excellent in both graininess and image sharpness. This may be accomplished, according to the present invention, by a negative type silver halide photographic material comprising silver halide grains of a core shell structure which consists of an inner core essentially consisting of silver bromide or silver iodobromide and a plurality of shells, essentially consisting of silver bromide or silver iodobromide, wherein each of the silver halide grains comprises a an outermost shell containing silver iodide of 0 to 10 mol , b a highly iodide containing shell provided inside the outermost shell, of which silver iodide content is from 6 to 40 mol and is at least 6 mol higher than that of the outermost shell, and c an intermediate shell provided between the shells a and b the silver iodide content of the intermediate shell being at least 3 mol higher than that of the outermost shell, and at least 3 mol lower that of the high iodide containing shell. In the silver halide composition of the silver halide grains relating to the invention, the expression, substantially comprising , means that the above mentioned silver halide grains are allowed to contain such a silver halide other than silver bromide or silver iodide as silver chloride and, more particularly, means that the content thereof is desirably not more than 1 mol if it is silver chloride, provided that the content thereof does not disturb the advantages of the invention. The special features of the photographic light sensitive materials of the invention may be summarized as given below Preferred compositions according to the invention satisfy the following criteria The volume of the outermost shell preferably comprises from 4 to 70 of the whole grain and, more preferably, from 10 to 50 thereof. The volume of the highly iodide containing shell preferably comprises from 10 to 80 of a whole grain and, more preferably, from 20 to 50 and, further preferably, from 20 to 45 thereof. The volume of the intermediate shell preferably comprises from 5 to 60 of a whole grain and, more preferably, from 20 to 55 thereof. The highly iodide containing shell may comprise at least one part of an inner core and, more preferably, a separate inner shell is present inside the highly iodide containing shell. The iodide content of the inner shell is preferably from 0 to 40 mol and, more preferably, from 0 to 10 mol and, further preferably, from 0 to 6 mol . The grain size of the inner core is preferably from 0.05 to 0.8µm and, more preferably, from 0.05 to 0.4µm. In the distinctive features described in the above mentioned Item 5 , the iodide content of the whole grain is preferably from 1 to 20 mol and, more preferably, from 1 to 15 mol and, further preferably, from 2 to 12 mol . In the distinctive features described in the above mentioned Item 6 , the grain size distribution is allowed to be either one of the polydisperse type and the monodispere type. However, the variation coefficient of such grain size distribution is preferably not more than 20 in a monodispersed emulsion and, more preferably, not more than 15 . Such a variation coefficient will be defined as follows to measure a monodispersibility As for a multilayered color light sensitive material having the features mentioned in the Item 7 , it is desired that the multilayered arrangement is made of not less than three emulsion layers comprising three kinds of light sensitive layers a blue sensitive layer, a red sensitive layer and a green sensitive layer and at least one emulsion layer thereof contains the silver halide grains relating to the invention or the above mentioned desirable silver halide grains. The grain size of a silver halide grain which is defined as a length of one side of a cube having the same volume as that of the silver halide grain is preferably from 0.1 to 3.0µm and the configuration thereof may be, for example, an octahedron, a cube, a sphere, or a flat plate and, most preferably, an octahedron. The layer arrangements of the silver halide grains of the invention will further be described below As mentioned above, the inner shell may be the highly iodide containing shell, or there may be both an inner shell and a highly iodide containing shell. The inner shell and the highly iodide containing shell, the highly iodide containing shell and the intermediate shell, and the intermediate shell and the outermost shell may be adjacent to each other or, optionally another shell comprising at least one layer having an arbitrary composition hereinafter called an arbitrary shell may be interposed between the above mentioned shells. The above mentioned arbitrary shell may suitably be a monolayered shell having a uniform composition, a plurality of shells each having a uniform composition with a stepwise change in composition from shell to shell, a continuous shell which changes its composition gradually in its arbitrary shell, and the combination thereof. The above mentioned highly iodide containing shell and intermediate shell may be used together as a pair or a plurality of layers may be employed. Examples of the layer arrangements of the silver halide grains relating to the invention are as follows The inner cores of the silver halide grains of the invention can be prepared by a process as described in, for example, P. Glafkides, Chimie et Physique Photographique , published by Paul Montel, 1967 G.F. Duffin, Photographic Emulsion Chemistry , published by The Focal Press, 1966 V.L. Zelikman et al, Making and Coating Photographic Emulsion , published by The Focal Press, 1964 Such processes typically include an acid method process, a neutral method process, and an ammonia method process. Further, a single jet precipitation process, a double jet precipitation process or the combination thereof may also be applied to cause the reaction between a soluble silver salt and a soluble halide. In addition, the reverse precipitation process may be employed in which grains may be formed in presence of silver ions in excess. The controlled double jet precipitation process, a version of the double jet precipitation processes, may also be applied for keeping a pAg value of a silver halide produced in a liquid phase. According to this process, a silver halide emulsion regular in crystal form and nearly uniform in grain size may be prepared. It is also possible to use a mixture of two or more kinds of silver halide emulsions each prepared separately, and in this case a double jet precipitation process or a controlled double jet precipitation process is preferably used. The A pAg value varies in accordance with the reaction temperature and the kinds of silver halide solvents in the preparation of an inner core, and is preferably from 2 to 11. It is also preferred to use a silver halide solvent, because the grain forming time may be reduced. A silver halide solvent such as ammonia or thioether may be used. Inner cores may be used in a flat plate, sphere or twinned crystal system and also in the form of an octahedron, cube, tetradecahedron or the mixed forms thereof. In order to prepare grains of uniform size, it is preferred to grow up grains rapidly within the critical saturation limit, in a process such as that described in, for example, British Patent No. 1,535,016 and Japanese Patent Examined Publication Nos. 36890 1973 and 16364 1977, in which the respective rates of addition of silver nitrate and an aqueous solution of a halogenated alkali are adjusted according to the growth rate of the grains or in such a process as described in, for example, 4,242,445 and Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 158124 1980, in which the concentration of an aqueous solution is adjusted. The above mentioned processes may also advantageously be used to introduce arbitrary shells, highly iodide containing shells, intermediate shells or the outermost shells, because new renucleation will not occur and each silver halide grain is uniformly coated in these processes. In the invention, if necessary, a single shell or a plurality of arbitrary shells may be interposed between the highly iodide containing shell comprising silver halide grains and the intermediate shell. Such highly iodide containing shells may be provided by a process including a desalting step, if necessary, applied to the resultant inner shell or the inner shell provided with an arbitrary shell and an ordinary halogen substitution process a silver halide coating process or the like is then performed. The halogen substitution process may be performed for example, such that, after an inner core is formed, an aqueous solution mainly comprising an iodide compound preferably, potassium iodide , which is preferably not higher than 10 in concentration, is added. This processes are more particularly described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 2,592,250 and 4,075,020 Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 127549 1980 and the like. To decrease the difference in an iodide distribution between the grains of the highly iodide containing shell, it is preferable, in this process, to adjust the concentration of the aqueous iodide compound solution to 10 ² mol or lower and then to add the solution over a period of at least ten minutes. The processes for providing a coating of a silver halide an inner core include, for example, the double jet precipitation process and controlled double jet precipitation process, in which, in each case, an aqueous halide solution and an aqueous silver nitrate solution are simultaneously added. More specifically, the processes are described in detail in, for example, Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos. 22408 1978 and 14829 1983 Japanese Patent Examined Publication No. 13162 1968 Journal of Photographic Science , No. 24,198, 1976 and the like. When the highly iodide containing shell is formed, the pAg value is varied in accordance with the reaction temperature and the nature and the amount of silver halide solvents used. The same conditions as those for the case of the above mentioned inner core are appropriate to this case. When using ammonia as a solvent, a pAg value of from 7 to 11 is preferred. For the preparation of the highly iodide containing shell, a double jet precipitation process or a controlled double jet precipitation process is preferred. The intermediate shells, of the silver halide grains of the invention may be prepared such that a highly iodide containing shell is arranged onto the surface of a grain containing the above mentioned highly iodide containing shells and the inner shells, or, if required, the highly iodide containing shell is provided thereon with a single or plurality of arbitrary shells and, to the outside of the above mentioned grain, a silver halide a halogen composition different from those of the highly iodide containing shells is further coated in a double jet or controlled double jet precipitation process or the like. The aforementioned process for preparing highly iodide containing shell may similarly serve as the above mentioned processes. The outermost shell of the silver halide grains of the invention may be provided in such a manner that an intermediate shell is provided to the surface of a grain containing the above mentioned intermediate shells, the highly iodide containing shells and the inner core or, if required, the intermediate shell provided thereon with a single or plurality of arbitrary shells and, to the outside of the above mentioned grain, a silver halide having a halogen composition different from those of the highly iodide containing shells and the intermediate shells is further coated in a double jet or controlled double jet precipitation process or the like. The aforementioned highly iodide containing shell providing process is similarly applied to serve as the above mentioned processes. Any number of arbitrary shells may optionally be interposed if required, between the inner core and the highly iodide containing shell, and or between the highly iodide containing shell and an intermediate shell, and or the intermediate shell and the outermost shell. The above mentioned arbitrary shells may be prepared by the same processes as employed to prepare the aforementioned highly iodide containing shell. When trying to provide a shell adjacent to an inner core, a highly iodide containing shell, an outermost shell or arbitrary shells provided to the respective positions, an ordinary desalting process may be performed to prepare the adjacent shell. Alternatively if required, such shells may be continuously formed without carrying out any desalting. Structural characteristics of the silver halide grains of the invention such as the iodide content of each coated shell of the silver halide grains may be determined by such methods as that described in, for example, J.I. Goldstein and D.B. Williams, X Ray Analyses in TEM ATEM , Scanning Electron Microscopy, 1977, vol. 1, LIT Research Institute, p. 651, March, 1977 Annual Meeting of SPSTJ 84 , p 49 51 1984 The International East West Symposium on the Factors Influencing Photographic Sensitivity 1984 , c 60 c 63 1984 Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 143331 1985 and Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 143332. It is possible to remove an excessive halide or a salt or compound such as a nitrate, ammonia and the like produced as a by product from the dispersion medium of the grains which are the final products obtained after the outermost shell of the invention was formed. The suitable methods of removing the above mentioned materials typically include, for example, a noodle washing method usually applied to an ordinary type emulsion a dialysis method a sedimentation method utilizing an inorganic salt, an anionic surfactant, such an anionic polymer as a polystyrene sulfonic acid, or such a gelatin derivative as an acylated or carbamoylated gelatin and a flocculation method. The core shell type silver halide grains of the invention can be optically sensitized to a desired wavelength region, and there is no special limitation to the optical sensitization methods. The grains may be optically sensitized by making use, independently or in combination, of an optical sensitizer such as cyanine or merocyanine dyes suitably including, for example, zero methine, monomethine, dimethine, and trimethine. A combination of spectrally sensitizing dyes is often used particularly for a supersensitization. An emulsion may contain, as well as the above mentioned spectrally sensitizing dyes, a dye having no spectrally sensitizing characteristic in itself or a substance substantially incapable of absorbing any visible rays off light but capable of displaying super sensitizing characteristics. These techniques are described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 2,688,545, 2,912,329, 3,397,060, 3,615,535 and 3,628,964 British Patent Nos. 1,195,320, 1,242,588 and 1,293,862 West German OLS Patent Nos. 2,030,326 and 2,121,780 Japanese Patent Examined Publication Nos. 4936 1968 and 14030 1969 Research Disclosure, vol. 176, No. 17643, published in Dec., 1978, p. 23, Paragraph IV, Item J and the like. The above mentioned techniques may be optionally selected according to a wavelength region, sensitivity and the like to which a sensitization is to be applied and, additionaly in accordance with with the purpose and use of a light sensitive material. The core shell type silver halide crystals of the invention may also be treated by various chemical sensitization processes applicable to ordinary type emulsions. The chemical sensitization may be carried out by a process such as that described in, for example, H. Frieser, Die Grundlagen der Photographische Prozesse mit Silberhalogeniden , Akademische Verlagsgesselschaft, 1968, pp. 675 34. Namely, there may be used, independently or in combination, a sulfur sensitization process employing a compound or active gelatin containing sulfur capable of reacting with silver ions a reduction sensitization process employing a reducible substance a noble metal sensitization process employing gold and other noble metal compounds and the like. As for the sulfur sensitizers, a thiosulfate, a thiourea, a thiazole, a rhodanine and other compounds may be used. They typically include those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 1,574,944, 2,410,589, 2,278,947, 2,728,668, 3,656,955, 4,032,928 and 4,067,740. As for the reduction sensitizers, a stannous salt, an amine, a hydrazine derivative, a formamidine sulfinic acid, a a silane compound may suitably be used.

For the noble metal sensitization, a gold complex salt and the metal complex salts of the VIII group of the periodic table, such as platinum, iridium, and palladium may suitably be used. They typically include those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,399,083 and 2,448,060 British Patent No. 618,061 and the like. The silver halide grains of the invention may be treated by a combination of two or more of the above mentioned chemical sensitization processes. The amount of silver to be coated is not limited but is preferably in the range of from 1000mg m² to 15000mg m² and, more preferably, from 2000mg m² to 10000mg m². The light sensitive layers each containing the above mentioned grains may be present on both sides of a support. When forming each of the shells of the core shell type emulsion of the invention, various kinds of dopants may be doped. The inner dopants include, for example, silver, sulfur, iridium, gold, platinum, osmium, rhodium, tellurium, selenium, cadmium, zinc, lead, thallium, iron, antimony, bismuth, and arsenic. To dope the above mentioned dopants, the water soluble salts or complex salts thereof may be used in combination with the dopants when forming each of the shells.

Inter alia, they are particularly suitable for a high speed color light sensitive material. When applying a core shell type silver halide emulsion of the invention to a color photographic light sensitive material, the silver halide emulsion should be treated in such a process as usually applied to a color light sensitive material as well as with the materials therefor.

The couplers may be of either 4 or 2 equivalent per silver ion. They may also be colored couplers capable of displaying a color compensation effect or couplers capable of releasing a development inhibitor while a development is being carried out, which are called non coloration DIR couplers .

The light sensitive materials of the invention may contain an anticolor fogging agent such as a hydroquione derivative, an aminophenol derivative, a gallic acid derivative or an ascorbic acid derivative. This invention may also be applied to a multilayered multicolor photographic light sensitive material comprising a support bearing thereon at least two light sensitive layers having different spectral sensitivity from each other. Generally, a multilayered color photographic material is provided, on the support thereof, with at least one each of red , green and blue sensitive emulsion layers, respectively. The layers may be arranged in any order, as appropriate. It is usual for the combination to contain cyan forming couplers in a red sensitive emulsion layer, magenta forming couplers in a green sensitive emulsion layer and yellow forming couplers in a blue sensitive emulsion layer, however, a different combination may also be adopted, if necessary. In the photographic light sensitive materials of the invention, the photographic emulsion layers and other hydrophilic colloidal layers thereof may be coated on the support or other layers thereof by various well known coating methods such as a dip coating method, a roller coating method, a curtain coating method or an extrusion coating method. The preferred methods are described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 2,681,294, 2,761,791 and 3,526,528. The support of the above mentioned photographic light sensitive materials may be, for example, baryta paper, polyethylene coated paper, synthetic polypropylene paper, glass plate, cellulose acetate film, cellulose nitrate film, polyvinyl acetal film, polypropylene film, polyester film such as polyethyleneterephthalate film or polystyrene film, each of which is ordinarily used and may suitably be selected according to the intended use of the photographic light sensitive materials. The above mentioned supports may also be sublayered, if required. The photographic light sensitive materials containing the core shell type silver halide emulsions relating to the invention may be exposed to light and, after then, developed by any conventional process. A black and white developer is an alkaline solution containing a developing agent such as a hydroxybenzene, an aminophenol or an aminobenzene and, in addition, it may also contain a sulfite, carbonate, bisulfite, bromide or iodide of an alkali metal salt. When the above mentioned photographic light sensitive material is for color photographic use, it may be color developed by any convention color developing process. In a reversal process, the development is performed using a black and white developer followed by exposure to white light or a treatment in a bath containing a fogging agent, and further a color development is made with an alkaline developer containing a color developing agent. There is no particular restriction as to which processes should be used. A typical example of such a process is that, after color development, a bleach fixing is made and, if required, followed by washing and a stabilizing process another example thereof is that, after color developing, bleaching and fixing are separately performed and, if required, washing and a stabilizing process are further performed. Generally, a color developer comprises an aqueous alkaline solution containing a color developing agent. The color developing agents include, for example, well known aromatic primary amine developers such as a phenylenediamine, e.g.. 4 amino N,N diethylaniline, 3 methyl 4 amino N,N diethyl aniline, 4 amino N ethyl N β hydroxyethylaniline, 3 methyl 4 amino N ethyl N β hydroxyethylaniline, 3 methyl 4 amino N ethlyl N β methanesulfonamidoethylaniline and 4 amino 3 methy N ethyl N β methoxyethylaniline. In addition to the above, it is also possible to use those described in, for example. L.F.A. Mason, Photographic Processing Chemistry . Focal Press, 1966, pp. 226 229 U.S. Patent Nos. 2,193.015 and 2,592,364 and Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 64933 1973. The color developers may also additionally contain a pH buffer and or an antifoggant. They may also further contain, if required, any one of a water softener, a preserver, an organic solvent, a development accelerator, a dye forming coupler, a competing coupler, a fogging agent, an auxiliary developer, a thickener, a polycarboxylic acid chelating agent, and an oxidation inhibitor. The photographic emulsion layers are ordinarily bleached after they are color developed. The bleaching process may be carried out either simultaneously with the fixing process, or independently. The bleaching agents for this purpose include, for example, the compounds of a polyvalent metal such as iron III , cobalt IV , chromium VI or copper II or a peroxy acid, a quinone, or a nitroso compound. It is possible to add to a bleaching or bleach fixing liquid, various additives as well as the bleaching accelerators such as those described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,042,520 and 3,241,966, Japanese Patent Examined Publication Nos. 8506 1967 and 8836 1967, and the thiol compounds such as those described in, for example, Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 65732 1978. The following examples will further illustrate preferred preparation of the silver halide grains relating to the invention. 1 1 Preparation of Inner Core Both Solutions of E 1 and B 1 were added to Solution A 1 in a double jet precipitation method, at 40 C, by making use of a mixing stirrer described in Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos. 92523 1982 and 92524 1982. While the double jet precipitation method was being applied, the pAg and pH value thereof and the rates of addition of both Solutions of E 1 and B 1 were controlled as shown in Table 1. The pAg and pH values were controlled by adjusting the flow rates of both Solutions F 1 and H 1 by making use of a roller tube pump capable of changing flow rates. Three minutes after the addition of Solution E 1 was completed, a pH value of the resulted matter was adjusted with Solution I 1. Next, the resultant matter was desalted and washed by a conventional method and dispersed in an aqueous solution containing 125g of ossein gelatin. An aggregate amount of the dispersed matter was then adjusted with distilled water to 4,800ml. It was observed with an electron microscope that the resulted emulsion was a monodispersed emulsion of 0.09µm in average grain size. Hereinafter, the term, grain size , means a length of one side of a cube which is equivalent to a grain in volume. 1 2 Provision of the 5th Shell Both Solutions of E 2 and B 2 were added to Solution A 2 in a double jet precipitation method, at 40 C, by making use of a mixing stirrer described in Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos. 92523 1982 and 92524 1982, by taking a time for 32.5 minutes at a minimum so as not to produce any small grains during the addition thereof. While the double jet precipitation method was being applied, the pAg and pH value thereof and the adding rates of both Solutions of E 2 and B 2 were controlled as shown in Table 2. The pAg and pH values were controlled by adjusting the flow rates of Solutions F 2, G 2 and B 2 by making use of a roller tube pump capable of changing flow rates. After the addition of Solution E 2 was completed, the pAg value was adjusted to 10.4 with Solution G 2 and, two minutes after then, the pH value was adjusted to 6.0 with Solution F 2, respectively. Next, the resultant matter was desalted and washed by a conventional process, and was dispersed in an aqueous solution containing 128.6g of ossein gelatin. An aggregate amount thereof was then adjusted to 3,000ml with distilled water. It was observed with an electron microscope that the resulted emulsion was an excellent monodispersed emulsion of 0.27µm in average grain size and of 12 in the variation coefficient of grain size distribution. Both Solutions of E 3 and B 3 were added to Solution A 3 in a double jet precipitation method, at 40 C, by making use of a mixing stirrer described in Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos. 92523 1982 and 92524 1982, by taking a time for 56.5 minutes at a minimum so as not to produce any small grains during the addition thereof. During the double jet precipitation method, the pAg and pH values and the rates of addition of both Solutions of E 3 and B 3 were controlled as shown in Table 3. The pAg and pH values were controlled by adjusting the flow rates of Solutions F 3, G 3 and B 3 by making use of a roller tube pump capable of changing flow rates. Two minutes after the addition of Solution E 3 was completed, the pAg value was adjusted to 10.4 with Solution G 3 and, two minutes after then, the pH value was adjusted to 6.0 with Solution F 3, respectively. Next, the resultant matter was desalted and washed by a conventional process, and was dispersed in an aqueous solution containing 128.1g of ossein gelatin. After then, an aggregate amount thereof was adjusted to 3,000ml with distilled water. It was observed with an electron microscope that the resulted emulsion was an excellent monodispersed emulsion of 0.80µm in average grain size and of 10 in the variation coefficient of grain size distribution. 1 4 Provision of Highly iodide containing Shell, Intermediate Shell and the Outermost Shell of the Invention Both Solutions of E 4 and B 4 were added to Solution A 4 in a double jet precipitation method, at 50 C, by making use of a mixing stirrer described in Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos. 92523 1982 and 92524 1982, by taking a time for 46.6 minutes. At the same time when the addition of Solution B 4, Solution C 4 was added thereto. After 35.9 minutes, i.e. when the addition off Solution C 4 was completed, Solution D 4 was added thereto and after 25.5 minutes, the addition of Solution D 4 was completed. During the double jet precipitation method, the pAg and pH values and the rates of addition of the solutions of E 4, B 4, C 4 and D 4 were controlled as shown in Table 8. The pAg and pH values were controlled by adjusting the flow rates of Solutions F 4 and G 4 by making use of a roller tube pump capable of changing flow rates. Two minutes after the addition of Solution E 4 was completed, the pAg value thereof was adjusted to 10.4 by, Solution F 4 and, after two minutes, the pH value thereof was further adjusted to 6.0 by Solution G 4, respectively. Next, the resultant matter was desalted and washed by a conventional method and was dispersed in an aqueous solution containing 127g of ossein gelatin. After then, the resulted dispersed matter was adjusted to an aggregate amount of 3,000ml with distilled water. It was observed with a electron microscope that the resultant emulsion was an excellent monodispersed emulsion of 1.60µm in average grain size and of 11 in the variation coefficient of grain size distribution. The emulsion EM 4 is a core shell type silver iodobromide emulsion having the silver iodide contents of 15 mol , 5 mol and 0.3 mol in the order arranged from the inside of each grain. i.e., Iℓ 0.3, Ih 0.5 and Im 5, respectively The emulsions, EM 5, EM 6, EM 7, EM 8 and EM 9, were prepared in the same manner as in 1 4 of the above mentioned preparation example, except that they employed the 7 kinds of solutions described in 1 4 of the preparation example and added KBr, KI and 4 hydroxy 6 methyl 1,3,3a,7 tetrazaindene in the amounts designated in Tables 4, 5, 6 and 7, respectively. The resultant emulsions were monodispersed emulsions each of 1.60µm in average grain size and their variation coefficients of grain size distribution were 17 , 15 , 12 , 16 and 16 , respectively. The emulsions, EM 10 through EM 26, were prepared in the same manner as in 1 4 of the Preparation Example 1, except that the 7 kinds of solutions designated in the Preparation Example 1 and, KBr, KI and 4 hydroxy 6 methyl 1,3,3a,7 tetrazaindene were used in the amounts designated in Tables 4, 5, 6 and 7, respectively. These emulsions were monodispersed, having an average grain size of 1.60µm and the variation coefficients of the grain size distributions of 10 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 18 , 19 , 35 , 39 , 10 , 11 , 11 . 11 , 12 , 12 , 12 and 13 , respectively. The emulsions, EM 28 and EM 29, were prepared in the same manner as in 1 4 of the Preparation Example 1, except that the 7 kinds of solutions designated in the Preparation Example 1 and, KBr, KI, and 4 hydroxy 6 methyl 1,3,3a,7 tetrazaindene were used in the amounts designated in Tables 4, 5, 6 and 7, respectively. Further, the Emulsion EM 27 was prepared in such a manner that the pAg and pH values and rates of addition thereof were changed to those designated in Table 9 in the course of the mixation thereof and the Emulsion EM 30 and 31 were also prepared as shown in Table 10. The above mentioned emulsions were monodispersed, having the average grain size of 1.6µm and the variation coefficients of the grain size distributions of 9 , 18 , 19 , 32 and 34 , respectively. The emulsion EM 32 was prepared in the same manner as in 1 4 of the Preparation Example 1, except that the 7 kinds of solutions designed in the Preparation Example 1 and, KBr, KI and 4 hydroxy 6 methyl 1,3,3a,7 tetrazaindene were used in the amounts designated in Tables 4, 5, 6 and 7, respectively, and the pAg and pH values and rates of addition of E 4, B 4, C 4 and D 4 thereof were further changed to those designated in Table 11 during mixing and the Emulsion EM 33 was prepared as shown in Table 12, and Emulsion EM 34 was further prepared as shown in Table 13, respectively. The above mentioned emulsions were the monodispersed having the average grain size of 1.6µm and the variation coefficients of the grain size distributions of 10 , 10 and 12 , respectively. The emulsions EM 35, EM 36 and EM 37 were prepared in the same manner as in 1 4 of the Preparation Example 1, except that the 7 kinds of solutions designated in the Preparation Example 1 and, KBr, KI and 4 hydroxy 6 methyl 1,3,3a,7 tetrazaindene were used in the amounts designated in Tables 4, 5, 6 and 7, respectively. Further, the Emulsions EM 38 and EM 39 were prepared in such a manner that the pAg and pH values and the rates of addition of E 4, B 4, C 4 and D 4 thereof were changed to those designated in Table 12 during mixing. The above prepared emulsions were monodispersed having an average grain size of 1.6µm and variation coefficients of the grain size distributions of 12 , 14 , 13 , 9 and 11 , respectively. The effects of an intermediate shell are shown by making use of the above mentioned Emulsions EM 5, EM 6, EM 7, EM 4, EM 8 and EM 9. Each effect thereof on sensitivity, fog, graininess, exposure range, sharpness and interlayer sensitivity was examined. The effects thereof on the sensitivity, fog, graininess, exposure range and sharpness were measured with monolayered samples prepared for this purpose. The effects on the multilayer sensitivity were examined with a multilayered color light sensitive material having three light sensitive layers, a blue light sensitive layer, a green light sensitive layer and a red light sensitive layer. The processes for preparing the samples and the methods of measuring the characteristics of the samples were as follows In this example, a magenta color forming coupler was used. Namely. 1 2,4,6 trichlorophenyl 3 3 2,4 di t amylphenoxyacetamido benzamido 5 pyrazolone was used in this example to serve as the magenta color forming coupler. Tricresyl phosphate TCP was used as the high boiling solvent for dissolving the couplers. The couplers were oil protect dispersed by a conventional method. The silver iodobromide emulsions EM 4 through EM 9 described in the aforementioned preparation examples were chemically sensitized by conventional method and were additionally green color sensitized with a green color sensitive spectral sensitizer. Each of the layers of this example was prepared in the following manner A high speed green sensitive emulsion layer containing 1.9g of the above described silver iodobromide emulsions which were chemically sensitized and color sensitized, and a dispersed matter comprising 1.9g of gelatin and 0.06g of DNP which stands for ditertiary nonyl phenol dissolving 0.20g of the magenta coupler and 0.04g of a colored magenta coupler. A yellow filter layer containing 0.15g of yellow colloidal silver, 0.11g of DBP which stands for dibutyl terephthalate dispersed matter in which 0.2g of an anti contaminating agent was dissolved and 1.5g of gelatin For measuring the sensitometric characteristics and the graininess, each of the samples was exposed to light through a wedge in an ordinary method and for measuring the graininess, each of the samples was exposed to light through a square wave frequency wedge and each of them was processed in the following steps The composition of the processing liquids used in the above mentioned processing steps are shown below With respect to the developed samples, the respective sensitometric characteristics, graininess and sharpness thereof were measured by making use of green light. A so called minimum optical density on a characteristic curve, obtained from a sensitometry. The higher a value of such a minimum optical density is, the more a fogginess is. Therefore, a high minimum optical density is not preferred. The reciprocal of a quantity of exposure in antilog which gives an optical density of fog 0.1 on a characteristic curve. In the table showing the results of the example, the reciprocal numbers each are expressed as a value relative to the sensitivity of the comparative example which is regarded as the value 100. The higher the value of such a reciprocal number, the better the sensitivity. Therefore, a high reciprocal number is preferred. The improvement effects on the sharpness of an image were detected by obtaining a MTF which stands for Modulation Transfer Function so as to compare the samples with each other with respect to the MTFs obtained when each spatial frequency is 10 lines per mm. The greater the MTF value, the better the sharpness. That is preferred. The standard deviation of a density value variation is obtained when scanning a dye image having a ratio of a RMS to a dye image density of Dmin. 0.8 with a micro densitometer having a round scanning aperture of 25 µm, and 1.000 times this value is expressed as a value relative to the standard deviation value of a controlled sample regarded as a value of 100. The higher the value, the coarser the graininess. That is not preferred. The greater the difference between an exposure quantity at a logarithmic value giving an optical density with a fog of 0.1 and an exposure quantity at a logarithmic value giving a maximum optical density of 0.1 is, the wider an exposure range is. It is, therefore, preferred that a difference therebetween is greater. The silver iodobromide emulsions EM 4 through EM 9 described in the above mentioned preparation examples were chemically sensitized by conventional methods so as to prepare a color photographic material comprising 9 layers including 3 kinds of light sensitive layers, a blue light sensitive layer, a green light sensitive layer and a red light sensitive layer, in the following manner. The emulsions EM 4 to EM 9 each chemically sensitized were changed only in a green sensitive high speed layer that was the 5th layer. In each sample, the same and common emulsions were used in the other light sensitive layers than the 5th layer. The sample was prepared by coating the aforementioned layers, in sequence, on a transparent support which comprises a sub layered cellulose triacetate film and bears thereon an antihalation layer containing 0.40g of black colloidal silver and 3.0g of gelatin . In all the examples mentioned below, the amounts of every material to be added to the light sensitive materials is indicated in an amount per square meter, and both the silver halide emulsion and colloidal silver are indicated in terms of silver content. A low speed red sensitive emulsion layer hereinafter called an RL layer containing 1.4g of a low speed red sensitive silver iodobromide emulsion layer containing silver iodide of 7 mol which was color sensitized to red 1.2g of gelatin 0.65g of tricresyl phosphate TCP in which 0.8g of 1 hydroxy 4 β methoxyethylaminocarbonylmethoxy N δ 2,4 di t amylphenoxy butyl 2 naphthamide hereinafter called C 1 0.075g of 1 hydroxy 4 4 1 hydroxy δ acetamido 3,6 disulfo 2 naphthylazo phenoxy N δ 2,4 di t amylphenoxy butyl 2 naphthamido.disodium hereinafter called a colored cyan coupler CC 1 and 0.015g of 1 hydroxy 2 δ 2,4 di t amylphenoxy n butyl naphthamide and 0.07g of 4 octadecyl succinimido 2 1 phenyl 5 tetrazolylthio 1 indanone were dissolved hereinafter called a DIR compound D 1 were dissolved. A high speed red sensitive emulsion layer hereinafter called an RH layer containing 1.3g of a high speed red sensitive silver iodobromide emulsion 1.2g of gelatin and 0.23g of TCP in which 0.21g of cyan coupler C 1 and 0.02g of colored cyan coupler CC 1 were dissolved. An intermediate layer hereinafter called an IL layer containing 0.04g of dibutyl phthalate hereinafter called DBP in which 0.07g of 2,5 di t octylhydroquinone hereinafter called an antistaining agent HQ 1 were dissolved and 0.8g of gelatin. A low speed green sensitive emulsion layer hereinafter called a GL layer containing 0.80g of a low speed silver iodobromide emulsion containing silver iodide of 6 mol which was green sensitized 2.2g of gelatin 0.95g of TCP in which0.8g of 1 2,4,6 trichlorophenyl 3 3 2,4 di t amylphenoxyacetamido 5 pyrazolone hereinafter called a magent coupler M 1 0.15g of 1 2,4,6 trichlophenyl 4 1 naphthylazo 3 2 chloro 5 octadecenylsuccineimidoanilino 5 pyrazolone herein after called a colored magenta coupler CM 1 and 0.016g of the DIR compound D 1 were dissolved. A high speed green sensitive emulsion layer hereinafter called a GH layer containing 1.8g of a high speed green sensitive silver iodobromide emulsion which was green sensitized 1.9g of gelatin 0.25g of TCP in which 0.20g of the magenta coupler M 1 and 0.049g of the colored magenta coupler CM 1 were dissolved. A yellow filter layer hereinafter called a YC layer containing 0.15g of yellow colloidal silver 0.11g of DBP in which 0.2g of the antistaining agent HQ 1 was dissolved and 1.5g of gelatin. A low speed blue sensitive emulsion layer hereinafter called a BL layer containing a low speed silver iodobromide emulsion containing silver iodide of 4 mol which was blue sensitized 1.9g of gelatin and 0.6g of TCP in which 1.5g of α pivaloyl α 1 benzyl 2 phenyl 3,5 dioxoimidazolidine 4 yl 2 chloro α dodecyloxycarbonyl ethoxycarbonyl acetanilide hereinafter called Y 1 was dissolved. A high speed blue sensitive emulsion layer hereinafter called a BH layer containing 1.0g of a high speed silver iodobromide emulsion which was color sensitized to blue 1.5g of gelatin and 0.65g of TCP in which 1.30g of yellow coupler Y 1 were dissolved. A protective layer hereinafter called a PR layer containing 2.3g of gelatin. The prepared multilayered color photographic material was exposed to white light through a wedge and processed in the above mentioned processing steps. A green optical sensitivity was obtained therefrom by a sensitometry. The definition of sensitivity is the same as that in the case of the above mentioned single layer coated sample. Table 14 shows the results of the fog, sensitivity, graininess, exposure range and sharpness off the single color sensitive coated sample as well as the results of the multilayered sample. The core shell type emulsions EM 4 and EM 7 each provided with a highly iodide containing shell, an intermediate shell and the outermost shell in accordance with the invention are capable of displaying remarkably higher sensitivity, as compared with such conventional core shell type emulsions as EM 5 and EM 9 neither of which were provided with any intermediate shell interposed between the outermost shell that is a low iodide containing shell and a highly iodide containing shell so as to contain iodide in an intermediate amount such a core shell type emulsion as EM 6 provided with an intermediate shell but having no reasonable difference in iodide contents between a highly iodide containing shell and the intermediate shell and such a core shell type emulsion as EM 8 having no reasonable difference in iodide contents between the outermost shell and an intermediate shell. It is also found that the above mentioned results are particularly remarkable with regard to multilayer sensitivity and that the core shell type emulsions of the invention are more effective in a multi layered color light sensitive material. Other core shell type emulsions outside the scope of the invention tend to broaden the grain size distribution and increase fogs, so bearing this in mind, it may be preferred not to use them. Table 15 shows the effects of varying the iodide content in highly iodide containing shells, prepared using the emulsions EM 4, EM 5 and EM 9 to EM 18 of the above mentioned Preparation Example and in the same manner as in Example 1. The emulsions EM 10 to EM 15 are examples in which the intermediate shells and the outermost shells each have constant iodide content while the iodide content of the highly iodide containing shells was varied. It is found therefrom that the higher the iodide content in a highly iodide containing shell, the better the sensitivity. An emulsion having an iodide content of 40 or 50 mol in the highly iodide containing shell thereof as EM 15 or EM 17 tends to show a reduced sensitizing effect. This is supposedly due to the fact that the grain size distribution was broadened, and it is found that the emulsions of the invention may be able to enjoy a satisfactory sensitization effect as compared with any emulsions each having the same highly iodide containing shell, such as EM 16 and EM 18, which are other than those of the invention. Table 16 shows, similarly to the above, the effects of the iodide contents in the low iodide containing shells and the intermediate shells. The lower the iodide content in the outermost shell, the greater the sensitizing effects of the invention. Particularly in multilayer sensitivity, the lower the iodide content in the outermost shell the greater the effects. Such an emulsion as EM 26 having a high iodide content by not less than 10 mol in the outermost shell thereof is rather lower in sensitivity than that of the comparative emulsions. Table 17 similarly shows the effects of the grain size distribution. In the invention, the sensitizing effects may effectively be obtained than in a monodispersed emulsion having a narrow grain size distribution. The emulsions each having a broader distribution are inferior, in sharpness, to the emulsions having a narrower distribution. The monodispersed emulsions of the invention are more preferred to serve as an emulsion excellent in sensitivity, fog and sharpness. Table 18 also shows the effects of varying the volume of a highly iodide containing shell. The sensitizing effects of the invention is rather less when the volume of a highly iodide containing shell is small, say 5 . as in EM 33 , though the emulsion may be sensitized a little, and the effects may be improved when using an emulsion provided with a highly iodide containing shell having such a relatively greater volume as 12 in EM 32, 22 in EM 33 and 41 in EM 34. Table 19 further shows the effects of whole iodide content in the whole silver iodobromide. In the invention, it is found that the emulsions each having a relatively higher whole iodide content, such as EM 35 and EM 36, show a reduced sensitizing effect and that the emulsions each having a relatively lower whole iodide content, such as EM 38, are poor in graininess, sharpness and exposure range and further that it is preferable to use the emulsions of the invention of which the iodide contents are within a suitable range, so that a high sensitivity, an excellent graininess, an excellent sharpness and a broad exposure range may be obtained.
