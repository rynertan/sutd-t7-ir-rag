# Electrical tab receptacle with a displaceable engagement member.

## Abstract
An electrical tab receptacle 10 for connection with a male tab 24 has a channel shaped receptacle portion 11 at its forward end for receiving the tab and includes a base 16 with upstanding side walls 17, 19, 19a , at least one of which is turned in to confront the base such that the tab is received therebetween. The tab receptacle further comprises a resi liently displaceable engagement member 18 extending from a side of the receptacle with a portion of the engage ment member providing an engagement element 20 posi tioned for engaging in latching engagement with a corres ponding portion of the tab 24 . The receptacle is characte rised by the engagement member 18 having a release portion 21 and 21A located outside the channel shaped receptacle portion 11 and on the same side of the base as the turned in side walls, the release portion being shaped and positioned for receiving a displacement force for moving the engagement element away from the base to cause its disengagement from the complementary tab, whereby the complementary tab can be removed. Embodiments of the invention rely on a pivoting or twisting action in the engagement member upon depression of the release portion towards the base.
