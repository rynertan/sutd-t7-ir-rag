## Description
The present invention relates to an inhomogeneous waveguide comprising a transformer for providing a connection between a rectangular waveguide and an elliptical waveguide according to the preamble part of claim 1. An inhomogeneous waveguide connector is one for joining waveguides having different cut off frequencies. From US A 2,767,380 and DE B 1 261 569, a transformer for connecting rectangular waveguides having different transverse dimensions is known. These prior art documents teach to increase the horizontal and vertical inside dimensions of the transformer when progressing in the longitudinal direction. From US A 2,960, 671 a transformer for coupling a rectangular waveguide to a circular waveguide is disclosed. In order to couple the waveguides having large impedance differences, the transformer comprises transmission sections which are stepped simultaneously in the wide and narrow dimensions. The steps are taken in opposite directions so that the step in the wide dimension produces an inductive shunt susceptance that is substantially equal in magnitude to and therefore cancels with the capacitive shunt susceptance produced by the step in the narrow dimension. The object underlying the present invention is to provide an improved inhomogeneous waveguide for joining rectangular waveguide to elliptical waveguide which provides a low return loss over a wide bandwidth and is relatively easy to manufacture. This object is solved by a waveguide comprising the features of patent claim 1. Preferred embodiments are subject to various dependent claims. Turning now to the drawings and referring first to Fig. 1, there is shown a connector 10 for joining a rectangular waveguide 11 to an elliptical waveguide 12. The transverse cross sections of the rectangular waveguide 11 and the elliptical waveguide 12 are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively, and the transverse and longitudinal cross sections of the connector 10 are shown in Figs. 4 6. The connector 10, the rectangular waveguide 11 and the elliptical waveguide 12 all have elongated transverse cross sections which are symmetrical about mutually perpendicular major and minor transverse axes The rectangular waveguide 11 has a width a r along the x axis and a height b As can be seen in Figs. 4 6, the connector 10 includes a stepped transformer for effecting the transition between the two different cross sectional shapes of the waveguides 11 and 12. In the particular embodiment illustrated, the stepped transformer includes four steps 21, 22, 23 and 24, associated with three sections 31, 32 and 33, although it is to be understood that a greater or smaller number of steps may be utilized for different applications. Each of the three sections 31 33 has transverse dimensions which are large enough to propagate the desired mode therethough, but small enough to cut off the first excitable higher order mode. For any given cross sectional configuration, the upper limit on the transverse dimensions required to cut off higher order modes can be calculated using the numerical method described in R.M. Bulley, Analysis of the Arbitrarily Shaped Waveguide by Polynomial Approximation , The transverse dimensions a In accordance with one important aspect of the present invention, the inhomogeneous stepped transformer in the rectangular to elliptical connector has a generally rectangular transverse cross section which increases progressively from step to step along the length of the transformer, in the direction of both of the x and y axes, so that both the cutoff frequency and the impedance of the transformer vary monotonically along the length of the transformer. Thus, in the particular embodiment illustrated in Figs. 4 6, the sections 31 33 have rectangular cross sections of width a At the rectangular waveguide end of the connector, the width a As can be seen in Fig. 4, the rectangular cross sections of the stepped transformer have arcuate corners. Although this corner radius is relatively small, it can be increased up to about one half of the height b In order to expand and or shift the frequency band over which the connector of this invention provides an improved return loss, a capacitive or inductive iris may be provided at the elliptical waveguide end of the connector. By increasing the internal transverse dimensions of the successive sections of the inhomogeneous transformer along both the major and minor transverse axes x and y, both the cutoff frequency f This invention is in contrast to prior art rectangular to elliptical waveguide connectors using inhomogeneous stepped transformers in which the transverse dimension was varied only along the minor transverse axis. In such a transformer the variation in cutoff frequency along the length of the transformer is not monotonic, increasing at one or more steps of the transformer and decreasing at one or more other steps, and leading to relatively high return losses. Stepped transformers with rectangular cross sections that varied along both transverse axes have also been used in the prior art, but not for joining elliptical waveguide to rectangular waveguide. It is surprising that a connector with a rectangular cross section would provide such excellent performance when joined to a waveguide having an elliptical cross section and a cutoff frequency different from that of the rectangular waveguide to which it is being connected. In one working example of the embodiment of Figs. 4 6, using a three section transformer designed for joining type WR137 rectangular waveguide to type EW52 corrugated elliptical waveguide, the connector had a constant corner radius of 0,125 inch 0.318 cm and the following dimensions in inches, in brackets cm In another example of the embodiment shown in Figs. 4 6, the stepped transformer was designed with four sections, again for use in connecting a type WR137 rectangular waveguide to a type EW52 elliptical waveguide. This four step connector had a constant corner radius of 0.125 inch 0.32 cm and the following dimensions in inches, in brackets cm In an actual test of the latter transformer, a return loss of better than 40 dB was obtained over a frequency band of 6.05 6.55 GHz which was expanded to 5.9 6.65 GHz with a 0.86 inch 2.18 cm capacitive iris. As can be seen from the foregoing detailed description, this invention utilises a waveguide connector for joining rectangular waveguide to elliptical waveguide, while providing a low return loss over a wide bandwidth. This connector is relatively easy to fabricate by machining so that it can be efficiently and economically manufactured with fine tolerances without costly fabricating techniques such as electroforming and the like. Since the connector utilizes a stepped transformer, the return loss decreases as the number of steps is increased so that the connector can be optimized for minimum length or minimum return loss, or any desired combination of the two, depending upon the requirements of any given practical application.
