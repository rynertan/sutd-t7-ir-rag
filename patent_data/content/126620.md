# ENGINE COOLING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A diesel engine 2 having a charge air cooler 34 is liquid cooled and employs a single heat exchanger 28 for cooling the coolant for both the cylinder block 4 and the charge air cooler 34 . The engine block 4 is connected in a first cooling circuit which includes a pump 8 and a thermostatic valve 12 , while the charge air cooler 34 is connected in a second circuit including the heat exchanger 28 and pump 30 . When the coolant in the first circuit is below the operating tempera ture, the two circuits operate independently. When operating temperature is reached, the valve 12 opens to bring the two circuits partly in series, with the second circuit between the heat exchanger 28 and the first circuit at the downstream side of the heat exchanger, so that the charge air cooler 34 operates at a lower temperature than the engine cylinder block 4 .
