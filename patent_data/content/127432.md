# ARTICLE FOR PROTECTING SUBSTRATES

## Abstract
A substrate is protected from excessive heat by covering it with a protective article comprising a glass fiber element which has been coated with a silicone rubber composition containing about 0.01 to about 10 by weight, based on the weight of the rubber, of a boron compound. The article pro tects the underlying substrate for a period of time if exposed to temperatures of up to about 2000 F and indefinitely if exposed to temperatures of up to about 500 F. The tempera ture differential between the inner and outer surfaces of the protective article can be as high as 800 F thereby protecting the underlying substrate from damage caused by excessive heat.
