# Fluorochemicals and fibrous substrates treated therewith.

## Abstract
Cationic and non ionic fluorochemicals, mixtures of cationic and non ionic fluorochemicals, blends of the mix tures with fluorochemical poly oxyalkylenes , and composi tions of the fluorochemicals with hydrocarbon nonionic surfactants are provided. These fluorochemicals and com positions, in dispersions, emulsions and microemulsions, may be applied to porous fibrous substrates to give oil and water repellancy and soil resistance.
