# ECL memory cells.

## Abstract
An improved ECL bipolar memory cell is disclosed which comprises connecting the respective collectors of the mem ory transistors in the flip flop circuit to bit lines using Schottky diodes to protect against latch up of the ECL cell and the inversion of the transistors in the circuits to provide a buried emitter construction for alpha strike protection. In a preferred embodiment, the Schottky diode and the load devices, such as resistors or load transistors used to couple the cell to one of the word lines are made using polysilicon to facilitate construction of the cell, reduce the total number of contacts needed, and enhance the speed of the cell.
