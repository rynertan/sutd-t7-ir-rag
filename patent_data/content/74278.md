# Treatment of contaminated Stretford solutions in gas purification.

## Abstract
A process for treating a used sulfur particule free Stretford process alkaline aqueous solution containing anthraquinone disulfonate ions and vanadate ions the process comprising contacting the solution with activated carbon to separate anthraquinone disulfonate from the solution then contacting the solution with an anion exchange resin to separate the vanadate from the solution obtaining thereby an alkaline aqueous solution which is substantially depleted of the anthraquinone disulfonate and the vanadate.
