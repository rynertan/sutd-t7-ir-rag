# Process for applying a coating composition to a substrate, and the coated substrate thus obtained.

## Abstract
A process is provided for cleaning a substrate and providing it with a durable corrosion protecting coating by subjecting a part of the substrate to a blasting treatment and simultaneously hitting the same part of the substrate by a stream of a film forming binder. Structures in a marine environment can thus be provided with a durable coating in one combined operation of cleaning and coating. The invention also relates to the substrate thus obtained.
