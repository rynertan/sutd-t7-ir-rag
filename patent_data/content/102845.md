# AN ALCOHOL DISSOCIATION PROCESS AND A REACTOR THEREFOR

## Abstract
A reactor for use in the dissociation of alcohol com prises a reaction chamber wall, reactor chamber inlet means, reaction chamber outlet means, inner fins, and catalyst bed material said reaction chamber wall enclosing said catalyst bed material, and defining a reaction chamber therewithin said inner fins being attached to said reaction chamber wall and extending therefrom into said reaction chamber said inlet means and said outlet means each being connected to said reaction chamber wall. The reactor is of particular interest in the treatment of alcohol fuel for use in internal combustion engines. The catalyst reactor is heated to a start up temperature, the catalyst bed reactor comprising a partial combustion catalyst and an alcohol dissociation catalyst liquid alcohol is vaporized to form alcohol vapor which is mixed with air to form a partial combustion mixture which mixture is con tacted with the partial combustion catalyst whereby a dissociation mixture is formed and heat evolved. The dissociation mixture is then contacted with the dissociation catalyst to form a hydrogen rich fuel, which fuel is mixed with air to form a total combustion mixture for combustion in an internal combustion engine.
