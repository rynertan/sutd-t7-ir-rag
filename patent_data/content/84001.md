## Description
This invention relates to electrical induction logging systems for determining the nature and characteristics of the various sub surface formations penetrated by a borehole in the earth. More particularly, this invention relates to a method and system for processing the induction log measurements whereby the non linear variations in the sonde response function as a function of the conductivity of the formations being investigated and the unwanted contributions to each log measurement from currents flowing in formations spaced apart from the measurement depth are attenuated. It is important to the oil and gas industry to know the nature and characteristics of the various sub surface formations penetrated by a borehole because the mere creation of a borehole typically by drilling usually does not provide sufficient information concerning the existence, depth location, quantity, etc., of oil and gas trapped in the formations. Various electrical techniques have been employed in the past to determine this information about the formations. One such technique commonly used is induction logging. Induction logging measures the resistivity or its inverse, conductivity of the formation by first inducing eddy currents to flow in the formations in response to an AC transmitter signal, and then measuring a phase component signal in a receiver signal generated by the presence of the eddy currents. Variations in the magnitude of the eddy currents in response to variations in formation conductivity are reflected as variations in the receiver signal. Thus, in general, the magnitude of a phase component of the receiver signal, that component in phase with the transmitter signal, is indicative of the conductivity of the formation. In theory, the electrical resistivity of the formation should be relatively high or the conductivity relatively low when the formation contains a high percentage of hydrocarbons because hydrocarbons are relatively poor conductors of electricity. Where hydrocarbons are not present in the formations and the formations contain salt water, the electrical resistivity of the formation should be relatively low. Formation water, typically salty, is a relatively good conductor of electricity. Induction resistivity logging tools thus obtain information about the formations which can be interpreted to indicate the presence or absence of these hydrocarbons. U.S. patents 2,582,314 3,340,464 3,147,429 3,179,879 and 3,056,917 are illustrative of typical prior art well logging tools which utilize the basic principles of induction logging. In each of the tools disclosed in these patents, a signal generator operates to produce an AC transmitter signal which is applied to a transmitter coil. The current in the transmitter coil induces in the formations a magnetic field, which, in turn, causes eddy currents to flow in the formations. Because of the presence of these formation currents, a magnetic field is coupled into a receiver coil R thereby generating a receiver signal. Logging tools having a receiver coil and a transmitter coil each comprising several coils arranged in a predetermined geometrical fashion to obtain a desired response are commonly used. These coil systems are sometimes referred to as focused coil systems. The receiver signal is then amplified and applied to one or more phase sensitive detectors PSDs . Each PSD detects a phase component signal having the same phase as a phase reference signal which is also applied to the detector. The phase reference signal has a predetermined phase relationship to the current in the transmitter coil s . The output of the PSD s may be further processed downhole, or may be sent uphole to surface equipment for processing or display to an operating engineer. A quantitative determination of the conductivity of the formations is based in large part on the value obtained for the phase component signal that is in phase with the transmitter current in the transmitter coil. This component signal is commonly referred to as the real or in phase R component. Measurement of a phase component signal which has a phase orthogonal to or, in quadrature to the transmitter current is sometimes obtained. This component signal is commonly referred to as the quadrature phase X component signal. Measurement of both the R and X phase component signals of the receiver signal is known. U.S. patents 3,147,429 and 3,179,879 both disclose induction logging apparatus which detects real and phase mature components designated in those Patents as V In addition to the hardware limitations addressed by the system disclosed in the incorporated patent application, the methods for determining true formation resistivity at any particular depth from induction log measured data have in the prior art been adversely affected in cases where the true conductivity of adjacent bedding formations varies over a wide dynamic range. To interpret the tool voltage measurements representative of the true formation conductivity requires a sonde response function relating formation conductivity to output voltage measurements of the tool. This sonde response function is typically known as the vertical sensitivity curve of the induction tool sonde. For homogeneous formations, the sonde response function for a typical induction sonde can best be described as a response curve which has a main lobe of finite width from which the majority of the signal originates. Sidelobes to each side of the main lobes with non zero amplitudes extend longitudinally up and down the borehole from the center of the sonde with decreasing amplitude. A term widely used by those skilled in the art to describe this sonde response function is the vertical geometrical factor of an induction tool. The vertical geometrical factor GF is the sonde response function measured in a homogeneous formation having zero conductivity infinite resistivity . As is discussed below, the character of the sonde response function varies with the conductivity of the formations being investigated. Thus, the GF is a special situation zero conductivity for the sonde response function. The condition of zero conductivity is not often encountered in induction logging, although low conductivity formations are regularly encountered. The term, general geometrical factor GGF , is often used to describe the sonde response function regard less of the conductivity at which a given response curve is obtained. Because of the non zero sidelobes of the sonde response function, currents flowing in the formations above and below the sonde provide an unwanted contribution to the log measurements. For example, where the main lobe of the sonde response function is investigating a thin bed of low conductivity, the conductivity measurement will be too large if the thin bed is located near adjacent beds of higher conductivity. This unwanted contribution is referred to by those skilled in the art as the shoulder effect, and generally is meant to describe the incorrect interpretation of the sonde measurements resulting from the non zero sidelobes in the sonde response function. The character of these sidelobes of the sonde response function has in the past been controlled by the geometry of the sonde coupled with the physics of induction logging. Various attempts have been made in the past to minimize these sidelobes, for example, using multiple transmitter and receiver coils arranged in predetermined relationships within the sonde itself. U.S. patents 2,582,314 and 3,067,383 illustrate induction logging sondes in which multiple coils arranged in arrays are used to focus the sonde response function response curve to narrow the width of the main lobe and attenuate the sidelobes. U.S. patent 2,790,138 discloses an induction logging tool in which two separate induction coil arrangements are used, both arrangements having the same geometrical center with an inner transmitter receiver coil pair physically located between an outer transmitter receiver coil pair. Assuming that both coil pairs have the same sidelobe responses at vertical displacements greater than some fixed distance from the center of the sonde, by subtracting the signal from one coil pair from the other will reduce the effect of the contribution of formations spaced apart from the center of the sonde beginning at the fixed distance outwardly. These focused coil systems, and such techniques as disclosed in U.S. patent 2,790,138, have not been able to effectively reduce the sidelobes of the sonde response function to a level which will permit the logging tool to measure the conductivity of the formations accurately over several decades of magnitude. Because of the complexity of these focused coil arrangements, and the problems of mutual coupling and the difficulty in constructing the sonde, resort to more elaborate focused arrangements to further reduce the sidelobes has already reached a point of diminishing returns. In addition to the shoulder effect phenomenon discussed above, there is yet another problem which limits the ability of the induction logging equipment to accurately obtain a measure of the true conductivity of the formations over a wide dynamic range. This problem is characterized by the non linear changes in the profile of the sonde response function as a function of formation conductivity. As the conductivity of the formation being investigated increases, the amplitude and shape of both the sonde response function s main lobe and its side lobes changes, and these changes are non linear with increasing conductivity. This characteristic is referred to as skin effect. The skin effect phenomenon has also been described as that error signal which degrades the in phase component measurement of the conductivity to produce an incorrect value. This skin effect phenomenon results primarily from the mutual interaction with one another of different portions of the secondary current flow in the formation material. The magnitude of this skin effect phenomenon also increases as the system operating frequency increases. Prior art has shown that, among other things, the magnitude of this skin effect phenomenon is a complex and complicated function of the coil system operating frequency, the effective length of the coil system, and the conductivity value of the adjacent formation material. The last mentioned factor renders this phenomenon particularly objectionable because it produces the above mentioned non linear variation in the output signal of the sonde. The occurrence of these non linear variations can be substantially eliminated for a large range of formation conductivity values by proper choice of the coil system, operating frequency and the effective coil system length. These factors, however, place undue restraints on the construction and operation of the coil and associated circuits. These restraints, in turn, limit other desirable features of the coil system apparatus. For example, it is frequently desired that the coil system be able to accurately determine the conductivity value of the formation material in a region lying at a substantial lateral distance from the borehole. This requires a relatively large coil spacing or coil system length. A large spacing, however, increases the percentage of non linearity resulting from the occurrence of skin effect. As another example of undesirable restraint, the signal to noise ratio of the induction logging apparatus can be improved by increasing the tool s operating frequency. This, however, also increases the skin effect non linearity. If the conductivity of the formations being investigated is near zero, the GF response curve yields values of conductivities that are free of the skin effect phenomenon. But at higher conductivities, the skin effect, as reflected as a change in the sonde response function, causes the conductivity values obtained from the measurements of the tool to be in error. U.S. patent 3,147,429 characterizes this skin effect error as a voltage which subtracts from the geometrical factor signal predicted by the linear theory on which the GF response curve is based and which is well known in the art. U.S. patent 3,147,429 also discusses the skin effect phenomena as it relates to the quadrature phase component X of each conductivity measurement. Those skilled in the art have recognized that the magnitude of the X component is a function of the conductivity value of the formation material being investigated. The logging system of U.S. patent 3,147,429 assumes that, to a degree, the magnitude of the quadrature phase component measurement X is equal to the magnitude of the skin effect error signal. Since the skin effect error signal tends to decrease the measurement from that which would obtain if the GF were the proper response curve for the formations being investigated, the in phase component measurements can be corrected by adding an adjusted quadrature phase component where the adjustment is made dependent on the magnitude of the X component. While this approach yields some correction to the in phase component measurement for the skin effect error, there is no attention given in the prior art to the origin within the formation from where the skin effect error signal originates. Rather, the prior art corrects for skin effect based only on the magnitude of the component of the conductivity measurement itself. In other words, the spatial aspects of the skin effect error signals are totally ignored by the prior art. As shown in the case of the shoulder effect phenomenon previously discussed, a consideration of the spatial aspects of the system transfer function is important if a true and accurate measurement of the formation conductivity over a wide dynamic range of conductivities is to be obtained. The skin effect error also has a spatial aspect, because the conductivity of the formations being investigated may not be homogeneous throughout or that the formations adjacent the borehole may be invaded by the drilling mud. The shape and character of the spatial response function for the skin effect error signal can be defined as the difference between the GF response curve and the sonde response curves as measured at different values of conductivity. For these curves, it can be seen that the contributions of formations longitudinally displaced along the borehole from the point of the measurement contribute varying amounts to the skin effect error signal, even when a homogeneous medium is assumed. A gross adjustment to the in phase component measurement based on a pure magnitude reading for the quadrature phase component is not adequate to compensate for the skin effect phenomenon so as to permit accurate measurements of the true conductivity over a wide dynamic range in conductivity. Attention must be given to compensating the in phase measurement based on the contributions to the skin effect error coming from the various parts of the formations. Thus, it would be advantageous to provide a method of processing the induction log measurements and a system therefor that reduces the unwanted contributions in the log measurements from currents flowing in formations spaced apart from the measurement depth by minimizing the sidelobes in the resulting system response function used to translate the formation conductivity values into the processed measurements. It would also be advantageous to provide a method of processing the induction log measurements to minimize the effects of the non linear variations in the sonde response function resulting from changes in the conductivity of the formations being investigated. In accordance with the present invention, a system and method of processing induction log measurements to reduce the unwanted contributions in the measurements from formation currents flowing in formations spaced apart from each measurement depth is disclosed. The log consists of measurements of the sub surface formations taken by an induction logging system at various depths in a borehole in the earth. Each log measurement may consist of an in phase R and or a quadrature phase X component. The logging system has a sonde response transfer function which transforms the formation conductivity function into the measured voltage function of the logging system. The sonde response transfer function varies with the conductivity of the sub surface formations being investigated, and includes a main lobe which covers a length of the borehole and non zero sidelobes that extend outwardly therefrom. The essential features of the invention are set out in claims 1 and 11 respectively. The method comprises the steps of windowing the spatial domain sonde response function obtained at zero conductivity by truncating its Fourier transform at a spatial frequency less than the frequency at which the transformed function first goes to zero. For purposes of this disclosure, hereinafter, any reference to the frequency of a function refers to its spatial frequency as distinguished from a frequency which is time dependent. Next, a target transfer function containing the window frequencies is selected. A spatial domain filter response function is then determined from the truncated transformed zero conductivity sonde response function and the target transfer function, which when convolved with the zero conductivity spatial domain sonde response function, results in a sonde response function having reduced sidelobes. Finally, the method includes the step of convolving the spatial domain filter response function with the in phase log measurements to obtain a processed log in which the unwanted contributions in each measurement from spaced apart formations to each measurement are reduced. The step of selecting a target transfer function involves selecting a transfer function, such as a Kaiser window function, containing the frequencies remaining in the truncated transform zero conductivity sonde response function to produce a deconvolution filter that imparts minimum overshoot and ripple in the processed log for step changes in conductivity. The method is further characterized in that the spatial domain filter response function is determined from the ratio of the target transfer function to the truncated transformed zero conductivity sonde response function. In another aspect of the invention, a method of processing an induction log to reduce both the unwanted contributions in each measurement from formations spaced apart from each measurement depth and the effects of variations in the sonde response function with formation conductivity is disclosed. In addition to variations of the sonde response function with conductivity of the sub surface formations being investigated, the sonde response function is also characterized by a main lobe and non zero sidelobes. The method includes the steps of determining for each of a plurality of formation conductivity ranges a deconvolution filter response function based on the sonde response function where each filter function, when applied to the in phase component measurements of formations having conductivities in the range of that filter, reduces the unwanted contributions in the measurement from formations spaced apart from the depth at which the measurement was made. Finally, each in phase component measurement is processed by convolving the in phase component measurements with a deconvolution filter response function selected from among the plurality of filter functions according to the magnitude of the quadraturephase components of the measurements being convolved. The method is further characterized in that the step of determining a deconvolution filter response function for a given formation conductivity range comprises the steps of windowing the spatial domain sonde response function for the given conductivity range by truncating the Fourier transform of this transfer function at a frequency less than the frequency at which the transformed sonde response function first goes to zero. A target transfer function containing the window frequencies is then selected, and from the target transfer function and the truncated transformed sonde response function, a spatial domain filter response function is determined which when convolved with the given conductivity range sonde response function results in a sonde response function having minimum sidelobes. In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, a method of processing an induction log to minimize both the unwanted contributions in each measurement from formations spaced apart from each measurement depth and the effects of variations in the sonde response function with formation conductivity is disclosed. The method includes the steps of determining at each of a plurality of conductivity values a deconvolution filter response function based on the sonde response function at each value of conductivity. Next, a digital filter for implementing the deconvolution filter function is determine in which the digital filter has a plurality of coefficients. Each deconvoluntion filter is implemented by determining the values of the coefficients of the digital filter. A curve is then fitted for each coefficient to the plurality of values for each coefficient to obtain coefficient functions which vary as a function as a conductivity variable. Finally, the method includes the step of processing the in phase quadrature component measurements to reduce the effects of variations in the sonde response function with formation conductivity by convolving the in phase component measurements with a deconvolution filter implemented by said digital filter in which the coefficients of the convolved digital filter are determined by solving the coefficient functions for each coefficient using the quadrature phase component measurement as the value of the conductivity variable.

Similar reference numerals refer to similar parts throughout the drawings. Referring to the figures and first to Figure 1, a diagrammatic representation of the induction geometry for a two coil sonde one transmitter coil and one receiver coil is shown. For purposes of this disclosure, the derivations presented are based on the theory of induction logging as developed for this simple two coil arrangement. In practice, however, the coil arrangement for a typical induction sonde is more complex. Even though more complex, the present invention is equally applicable to the log measurements obtained by these more complex coil sondes because the response of a complex sonde is the linear combination of two coil sondes. Two difficult problems in induction logging are correcting measurements for shoulder effect and skin effect. Shoulder effect is the unwanted contribution to the measured conductivity of a thin bed of low conductivity by currents flowing in adjacent more conductive beds. This unwanted contribution results in a measured conductivity that is too large. Figure 4 illustrates a test section of a hypothetical log showing an assumed profile see also Figures 6 and 8 for the true formation resistivity and the resistivity log obtained from the prior art methods of processing the induction log measurement see U.S. patent 3,166,709 for a disclosure of one prior art method of calculating the resistivity of the formations from the mesurements . Where the true resistivity values are high low conductivity followed by a change to low resistivity high conductivity , an error is seen between the true resistivity and the calculated values This difference represents the shoulder effect. Skin effect is the non linear response of the induction device to increasing formation conductivity causing the measured conductivity to be less than directly proportional to the true formation conductivity. This non linearity is due to the attenuation and phase shift of the electromagnetic waves in the conductive formations. The theory of induction logging and this skin effect phenomena have been discussed extensively in the prior art. The article by Benri Georges Doll appearing in the June, 1949 issue of the Journal of Petroleum Technology entitled Introduction to Induction Logging and Application to Logging of Wells Drilled With Oil Base Mud, pages 148 162 Doll article , and the article by J. H. Moran and K. S. Kunz appearing in Vol. 28, No. 6 of the December, 1962 issue of Geophysics and entitled Basic Theory of Induction Logging and Application to Study of Two Coil Sondes, pages 829 858 Moran article , are representative treatments of the theory of induction logging. Additionally, U.S. Patent 3,147,429 issued to J. H. Moran Moran patent discusses in some detail the skin effect phenomenon. Summarizing the material as presented in the above cited materials, the voltage measurements obtained by an induction logging tool are representative of the conductivity of the formation based on the geometrical factor theory Doll article . Referring still to Figure 1, the induced currect This solution is described in general terms by the retarded potential solution which implies that the field giving rise to an eddy current at a given point in the formation is dependent on the magnitude of the current flowing in other parts of the formation. Alternatively, the field can be thought of as propagating through a dispersive medium. All interactive or propagation effects are described by the retarded potential solution, so, once the current distribution in the formation is computed, the voltage induced in the receiver coil by the formation currents can be computed by applying the Biot Savart law and integrating over the volume containing eddy currents. Thus, This leads to a general solution for the receiver signal in terms of the formation conductivity distribution σ In the homogeneous medium, g p,z, ,σ Equation 3 does not represent a proper convolution, for the function g p,z, , σ The following derivation considers only cylindrically symmetric formation geometries so the integration over disappears. Since the measured signal is constrained by the borehole to be a function of z only, integration over p obtains the vertical spatial sonde response function g given as follows However, in the limit of low conductivity, Equation 4 reduces to The convolution of g Since the measured signal σ The origin of the coordinate system for the expression for the measurement σ The non linearity of the sonde response function with increases in formation conductivity may be better understood by referring to Figure 3 which is a plot of the real R and the quadrature phase X components of each log measurement as functions of formation conductivity. As shown in Figure 3, when the true formation conductivity σ Referring to Figure 2, the sonde response function g The sonde response function for an induction logging tool would ideally be a delta function z z that maps the conductivity of an infinitesimally thin sheet of formation into the measured value of σ Although the sonde response function does not describe an infinitesimally thin sheet of formation, but rather includes contributions from the conductivity of formations several feet in thickness, there could possibly exist an operator h z which would map the sonde response function g z into the ideal delta function z z . Thus, an expression for z z could be written as Assuming that the conductivity is constant radially non invaded beds , in a homogenous medium, the apparent conductivity will be given by The Fourier transform of Equation 14 may be taken From Equation 13, if the ideal system transfer function ω is substituted for G Referring to Equation 16, if H ω is equal to the reciprocal of G An H For the target transfer function T To obtain accurate and precise readings of conductivity over a wide dynamic range, however, the ripple illustrated in Figure 6 must be eliminated. The present invention minimizes Gibbs phenomenon by replacing the target transfer function defined by Equation 18 with a target transfer function T In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the target transfer function T ω is a Kaiser window function. Kaiser window functions are known in the art of finite duration impulse response FIR digital filters. The article appearing in Vol. 28, No. 1, of the IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, February, 1980, and entitled On the Use of the I₀ Sinh Window for Spectrum Analysis, pages 105 107, discloses a Kaiser window function. Although a Kaiser window function is disclosed for the target transfer function to reduce the shoulder effect, the present invention is not limited to only this use. The target transfer function could be any function which will perform a transformation to obtain any desired system response function based on the geometrical factor. For example, a target transfer function could be choosen to produce a system response function which transforms medium depth conductivity measurements to appear as deep investigation log measurements. Thus, Equation 17 may be rewritten as Using techniques well known to those skilled in the art, such as the Remez exchange method, it is possible to determine a linear phase finite digital impulse response filter which implements the spatial domain filter function h z obtained from the inverse Fourier transformation of H ω of Equation 19. The Remez exchange method appears in the book entitled Theory and Applications of Digital Signal Processing by Rabiner and Gold, pp. 187 204 1975 . Figure 7 is an illustration of the sonde response function g It can be seen from Figure 7 that in the system response function f Thus far, the method for obtaining a deconvolution filter based on the geometric factor theory has been described. That is, a method in which the skin effect phenomenon is negligible, σ As previously discussed, the sonde response function g z depends on the formation conductivity in a highly non linear manner. This dependence is referred to as skin effect, and causes large errors in the deconvolution at high conductivities, regardless of what method of reducing shoulder effect is used. See U.S. Patent No. 3,166,709 for a prior art method to reduce the shoulder effect phenomenon. U.S. Patent 3,166,709 is incorporated herein for all purposes. Thus, the ideal situation should not only have a system response function which represents an infinitesimally thin sheet of formation, it should be constant regardless of the formation conductivity. In accordance with the present invention, one method of obtaining a constant system response function is to adapt the deconvolution filter h z obtained according to the inverse Fourier transform of Equation 19 to the conductivity of the formations. In adapting the deconvolution filter method, there are two basic approaches. The first approach is to determine various deconvolution filters for different conductivity ranges. Based on a control signal, an appropriate deconvolution filter may be selected from among the plurality of deconvolution filters and applied to the log measurements. For example, deconvolution filters may be obtained for the sonde response functions obtained for conductivities of 1, 500, 1,000, 3,000, 5,000 and 10,000 mmho m. Figure 9 illustrates the system response functions which result from the deconvolution filters obtained for the sonde response functions measured at 1, 500, 1000, 3000, 5000 and 10,000 mmho m. For the control signal, the quadrature component of the conductivity measurements σ A second approach for adapting the deconvolution filter method of reducing shoulder effect to also reduce skin effect is to continually adapt the coefficients of the digital deconvolution filter implementation of each deconvolution filter h z based on a control signal, such as the quadrature phase component σ For any formation, the skin effect error signal, σ It can be shown from the definitions of the response functions of Equation 22 that the same relation as given for the measurements in Equation 21 holds for the response functions, Because the measured signal σ The function g Although the mapping process involved in the induction measurement Equation 7 is not a proper convolution, and no deconvolution exists per se, any filter may be applied to the sequence of measurements σ Let g z represent any mapping function of the type g z, σ Since the filter coefficients for h n are constants, the summation can be taken into the integral as long as σ If a sequence of samples, g n , is taken of an arbitrary response function g z , then the operation It has been disclosed by both the Moran patent and the Moran article that for a homogeneous medium the imaginary, or X component signal, contains much of the information lost due to skin effect. The measured signals can be written as expansions in the parameter L , where The corresponding sonde response functions for the expressions in Equations 33 and 34, g Referring again to Figure 2, the most obvious difference between g Although some of the details of these two filters are different, the main averaging lobes of the two will be quite similar since the major job of the filter transformation is to increase the contribution from parts of the formation at large distances from the sonde. The gains of the two filters are different, since the ratio of σ The fact that the normalized filters at two rather widely separated conductivity levels are similar suggests that the main fitting transformation is the central lobe of the filter. For the present invention, a normalized average of two filters, obtained at two widely separated conductivities, is determined. This average filter, b The expression contained in Equation 28 for the geometrical factor conductivity measurement at location j can be expressed as From the transformation of g Equation 39 may be rewritten in terms of deconvolution to obtain Turning now to Figure 12, a block diagram illustration of an induction logging system which implements the phasor processing of the present invention, as given by Equation 39, is shown. An induction logging tool 30 is shown suspended in a borehole 26 by a wireline cable 28. The induction tool 30 includes a sonde 36 for purposes of illustration, a simple two coil sonde is shown having a sonde response function g z, σ still referring to Figure 12, a processing unit 12 for processing the induction measurements obtained by tool 30 is shown. A demux 16 separates the two components of each log measurement received from tool 30. The in phase component is applied to deconvolution filter means 18 and provisionally to summation means 24. The quadrature phase component is applied to linear filter means 20. Deconvolution filter means 18 implements a filter response function h z based on the geometrical factor response function g The output of filter 18 is a deconvolved conductivity measurement σ Processing unit 12 also processes the log measurements to reduce skin effect by filtering the quadrature phase measurements in a non linear filter means comprised of a linear filter means 20 and an amplifying means 22. Filter means 20 implements the linear filter response function b Referring now to Figure 13, a plot of the constant system response function f Turning now to Figure 14, a short section from an actual field induction log illustrating the improved accuracy of the phasor processing of the present invention is shown. The log shown in Figure 14 was obtained using the induction tool whose transfer functions are shown in Figure 2. Five traces are illustrated in Figure 14, the SP spontaneous potential , the SFL electrode tool trace, the IL The benefit of the deconvolution and skin effect phasor correction of the present invention is also illustrated in region A because of the large contrast between the high resistivity values occurring in the region A and the high conductivity shoulder beds located to either side. Because the main lobe of the sonde response function spans not only region A but also the shoulder beds to either side this is even true in the case of the compensated system response function of the present invention , the high conductivities of the shoulder beds, which are experiencing significant skin effect, are making a significant contribution to the conductivity reading obtained in the region A. But even in the presence of skin effect from the high conductivity shoulder beds, the phasor processing of the present invention more accurately determines the conductivity of the low conductivity bed located at region A. Referring now to Figure 15, a plot of f Summarizing the present invention, a method and system for processing an induction log to reduce the unwanted contributions from currents flowing in formations spaced apart from the measurement depth shoulder effect and the effects of the non linear variations in the sonde response function with linear variations in formation conductivity skin effect is disclosed. To compensate for the shoulder effect, the sonde response function obtained at zero conductivity the geometrical factor is Fourier transformed into the frequency domain. A window function is applied to the transformed zero conductivity sonde response function to pass only those spatial frequencies of the transformed function up to a predetermined upper frequency. This upper spatial frequency is chosen to be less than the first frequency at which the transformed zero conductivity sonde response function first goes to zero. A target function is chosen so as to produce any desired response function of the logging tool, such as a system response function having reduced side lobes to reduce shoulder effect. The ratio of the target transfer function to the transformed and truncated sonde response function is formed and its inverse Fourier transform taken to obtain a spatial filter function that produces minimum ripple in the processed log. A Kaiser window function is disclosed as a preferred target transfer function to obtain the desired reduction in the shoulder effect. The reduction in the unwanted contributions from the currents flowing in formations spaced apart from the measurement depth occurs when the spatial filter function obtained from the deconvolution method is convolved with the in phase component measurements of the log measurements. To minimize skin effect, the present invention discloses a method and system of phasor processing of the induction log measurements in which quadrature phase components σ
