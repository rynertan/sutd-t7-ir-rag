# CLAMP

## Abstract
A structural clamp especially for use in the offshore oil industry for clamping marine risers and the like and which allows longitudinal and lateral movement of the riser relative to the clamp, the clamp having spaced resilient projections whose outermost faces for engaging the clamped structure have low fiction material such as polytetrafluorethylene. The projections may be in the form of castellated ribs which are aligned vertically to allow water to drain through the clamp.
