# Preparation of bis aminophenyl ethers from N acetyl aminophenols or their phenolates.

## Abstract
Bis aminophenyl ethers are prepared by effecting condensation reaction of an N acetyl aminophenol or the corresponding sodium or potassium N acetyl aminophenate with a halonitrobenzene under condensation reaction conditions to form an N acetyl aminophenyl nit rophenyl ether and hydrogenating the nitro group thereof under nitro group hydrogenation conditions to form an N acetyl bis aminophenyl ether. The latter compound is hydrolyzed with aqueous mineral acid under acid hydrolysis conditions to form an acidic aqueous dispersion of the bis aminophenyl ether product, which can readily be recovered from the dispersion. Final bis aminophenyl ether products thus prepared are typically of high purity and excellent colour properties, i.e., substantially colourless.
