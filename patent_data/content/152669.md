# CONTINUOUS PNICTIDE SOURCE AND DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR FILM DEPOSITION, PARTICULARLY BY CHEMICAL VAPOUR DEPOSITION

## Abstract
A film deposition apparatus characterised in that it comprises A a reservoir for containing pnictide B means for passing an inert gas therethrough C a film desposition reaction chamber and D means for supplying inert gas carrying vapour spe cies after passing through the said pnictide to the said reaction chamber. A process for the supply of a pnictide vapour species to a film deposition process characterised in that it com prises passing an inert gas through a reservoir of heated pnictide. Referring to the accompanying illustrative diagram, there may be identified reservoir 30 , means B may com prise tube 28 , a chamber C is indicated at 22 and means D may comprise tube 60 . Such a pnictide bubbler feed system may be used to supply Pnictideâ‚„ species for various film deposition proces ses, including chemical vapour deposition, sputtering, vac uum deposition and molecular beam epitazy. Films of pnic tide, polypnictide and other pnictide compounds may be deposited for semiconductor and other applications includ ing insulation and passivation. The pnictides used may include phosphorus, arsenic and antimony. The present invention represents an advance over the prior art
