## Description
This invention relates to a rocket engine nozzle provided with latch seal means as stated in the precharacterizing portion of claim 1. Rocket engines for space station, orbital transfer vehicles and for earth orbiting satellites, for example, have length limitations since the storage space inside the carriers which project them into outer space is limited. One method of decreasing the length of the overall vehicle is to decrease the nozzle length of the rocket engine which propels the upper stage vehicle. However, the nozzle performance is proportional in part to the expansion ratio which, in turn, controls the nozzle length and diameter, and it is generally desirable to have a long nozzle for good nozzle performance and a short nozzle to conform to storage space limitations. The solution to this problem is to form the nozzle in at least two telescoping sections, a fixed section and an extendible section, the latter being extended only after the upper stage vehicle has been deployed from its carrier. However, when fully extended, it is necessary to lock the two sections together and to form a seal between them so that the hot engine gases cannot escape except through the open exit portion of the extendible nozzle. If gases escape through holes in the seal, the holes can be eroded and enlarged by the hot gases and engine thrust is decreased and misdirected. From EP A 49560 there is already known a rocket engine nozzle provided with means for latching and sealing the forward end of an extendible, mating section of said nozzle and the rear end of an associated, fixed, mating section of said nozzle after full extension of the extendible section comprising Furthermore, it is known from GB A 1 468 370 how to join tubular members having recesses by means of a deformable member defining a container and containing explosive material which is detonated to expand the deformable member. An object of the invention is to seal and latch the juncture between adjacent sections of two telescoping members by explosive means after they have been placed in full extension, in case where the telescoping members are a fixed and an extendible nozzle section of a rocket engine. Other objects, advantages and novel features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjuction with the accompanying drawing. A solution of the above mentioned objects is characterized by In an alternative solution the recess is formed in the forward end surface of said projection. The invention consists of a pair of disparate adjacent members, the first being formed with a recess adjacent to the second. An explosively expandable tube EET is affixed to the second member so that the EET is in line with the recess, with the second member lying between the recess and the EET. When the explosive within the EET is detonated, the EET expands, deforming the second member and forcing it into sealing and latching contact with the wall of the recess. An especially useful application for this invention is for sealing and latching the ends of two telescoping members such as the ends of a fixed and an extendible nozzle section of a rocket engine. In a second type of embodiment of the invention, the EET is placed between the recess and the second member, so that the metal of the EET container forms a seal with both the recess and the adjacent section of the second member after the explosive has expanded the EET container.

The same elements or parts throughout the figures of the draining are designated by the same reference characters. A preferred form of the invention is shown schematically in Fig. 1 in relation to a latch and seal between the independent sections of a nozzle for a rocket engine. The centerline CL 10 of a rocket engine is shown, a section through the nozzle 12 being taken. It should be noted that Fig. 1 is incomplete in that a similar, but complementary, section of the nozzle 12 should be shown below the centerline 10, i.e., the nozzle 12 actually encircles the centerline 10. Also, the forward toward the rocket engine, which is not shown end of the fixed nozzle 14 and the rear exhaust, or exit end of the extendible nozzle 16 are shown broken away. The rear end of the fixed nozzle 14 is formed with an outwardly protruding annular projection 18 which, in turn, is formed with an arcuate recess 20 in its outer surface 22. The recess 20 may have any desired cross section, such as the arcuate shape which is depicted or a rectangular shape, for example. The forward end of the extendible nozzle 16 is formed with an axially extending, annular flange 24, the inward surface of which is shaped complementarily to the outersurface 22 of the teat end of the fixed nozzle 14, except that the flange 24 has no recess. An inwardly extending annular shoulder 26 is formed at the forward edge of the flange 24. The shoulder 26 is designed to make contact with the forward end 28 of the outwardly protruding section 18 of the fixed nozzle 14. A flattened oval tube 30, known as the explosively expandable tube EET , is affixed to the outer surface of the flange 24 by any suitable means, such as a suitable adhesive or spot welding. The EET 30 contains within it, as seen in cross section, a circle of metal clad explosive 32 see Fig.3 , which may, for example, be Hexanitrostibene, Grade A, Type II, surrounded by a spacer 34, for example, silicone rubber, both the explosive 32 and the spacer 34 being enclosed in a thin circular container 36 of a metal, such as stainless steel, or niobium. The EET 30 and its contents are actually annular and extend peripherally around the extendible nozzle. The metal cladded explosive member 32 may be the commercial product known as a mild detonating fuse which comes in lengths and is called MDF. At one point, at least, the EET 30 is formed with a hole into which a detonator 38 is lowered to place it in close proximity to the container 36. Wires 40 to a source of electricity extend from the electrically initiated detonator cap 38. Detonating means other than electrical, such as thermic means, may be employed. After the extendible nozzle 16 is extended to its final rearward position, as shown in figs. 1 and 2, electricity is applied to the detonator 38. The detonation initiates the explosive in the MDF 32 and expands the oval tube 30 into a circle or an oval flattened in a direction perpendicular to its previous direction of flattening. The expansion of the EET 30 deforms the section of the flange 24 which is beneath the EET 30 and drives it into the recess 20 where it forms a tight fit with the surface of the recess 20, as indicated in Fig. 2. If the explosive is sized correctly and the surfaces shaped correctly, a weld can be formed between the recess surface and the now curved surface of the flange 24. The effect of the explosion is to tightly latch and seal together the ends of the fixed and extendible nozzles. A second embodiment of the invention is shown in Fig. 4. Here, a recess 20 is formed inside the annular section 18 of the fixed nozzle 14 with a channel opening 46 through the forward wall 28 of the annular projection 18. The EET 44 in this case is formed as an rearwardly directed, hollow, flattened annular flange which is fastened to the rear wall of the shoulder 26 by any suitable means. The EET 30 holds the MDF 32 and at least one detonator 38 within it, wires 40 extending from the detonator 38 through the annular projection 18 to an external source of electricity. When the MDF 32 is exploded, the EET 44 expands into a tight fit with the wall of the recess 20, as indicated by the dashed lines 42. A third embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Fig. 5. Here, at least one recess 20, which may be arcuate as shown, for example, is formed in the outer surface 22 of the outwardly protruding annular projection 18 of the fixed nozzle 14. The EET 30 is placed so as to span the diametral region of the recess 20 leaving a space 46 between the wall of the recess 20 and the outer wall of the EET 30. The EET 30 may be affixed to the outer surface of the projection 18. When the detonator 38 is energized, the explosion expands the wall of the EET 30 and a tight fit is formed with the wall of the recess 20 and with the inner surface of the annular flange 24 of the extendible nozzle 16. The annular flange 24 may originally be flat or formed with a concavity 48 into which the EET 30 expands. If it is flat, the explosion will form a concavity 48. It should be noted that the shell forming the EET 30 should be reasonably ductile and strong enough to be structurally sound after the explosion forms the latch and seal. Thus, in Figs. 4 and 5 in which the EET shell forms the seal between the fixed and extendible nozzle sections, the EET shell may be niobium or stainless steel, for example, or perhaps a modern fiber or plastic material. In Figs. 1 and 2, the annular flange 24 should also be a reasonably ductile and strong material, such as niobium, since the latch and seal is formed by the flange 24 and the recess 20 of the annular projection 18 of the fixed nozzle 14. The EET 30 is formed into the shape of an unclosed circle and its ends may be held together by any suitable device. A convenient device, as shown in Fig. 6, may be a block 50 having a bore 52 along its bottom surface and a hole 54 in its top surface connecting with the bore 52. The detonator 38 may be set into the hole 54 so that it rests in close proximity with the EET 30 and will initiate it when the detonator 38 explodes.
