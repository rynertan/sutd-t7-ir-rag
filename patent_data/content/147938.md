# DISPERSE DYESTUFFS

## Abstract
Disperse azo dyestuffs are obtained by coupling diazo tised meta nitroanilines onto 3 acylamino N,N di alkoxycarbonylalkyl aniline coupling components. The dyes are especially useful for direct printing of polyester, for continuous dyeing of polyester cotton blends and as a yellowing component for black, navy and other mixtures for printing where sublimation fastness is important. The dyes, which give red to yellow shades, exhibit good properties with respect to multifibre printing and non staining properties after wet treatments and good stannous chloride dischargeability.
