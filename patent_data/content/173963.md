# POLYMERS OF N SUBSTITUTED SECONDARY MONOALLYLAMINES AND THEIR SALTS AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE SAME

## Abstract
N substituted secondary monoallylamine salts can be easily polymerized in a polar solvent by using as catalyst a water soluble radical initiator containing azo group in the molecule, and polymers with a high degree of polymeriza tion can be obtained therefrom in a high yield.
