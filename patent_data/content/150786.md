# Imaging monochromator.

## Abstract
The monochromator presents, in the plane of the slit 5 , a mirror 6 which reflects the radiations comprised within the spectrum portion selected by the slit 5 towards the grating 3 dispersing a non monochromatic beam. The radiations reflected recombine into a single, substantially monochromatic beam on the grating 3 , and a suitable optical system 7,8 focuses such a beam forming the substantially monochromatic image of the source 1 .
