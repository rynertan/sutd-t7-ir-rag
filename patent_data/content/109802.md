# DOOR LATCHES

## Abstract
The present invention provides a door latch comprising a tongue 2 having a projecting position for latching a door, a handle shaft 1 having a longitudinal axis, at least one handle which acts on the handle shaft 1 and means 3, 5, 46 for transmitting motion of the shaft 1 to the tongue 2 , whereby the tongue 2 can be retracted from its projecting position to unlatch the door in at least two modes including moving the handle along the said axis, and rotating the handle with respect to the said axis. Many variations of the means 3 3, 5, 46 for transmitting motion of the shaft 1 are disclosed. Some of these variations use the conventional D lever component 46 alone, some use that component with additional compo nents and further embodiments avoid use of a D lever altogether. Disclosure is made of arrangements in which the extent of projection of the tongue 2 from the body of the latch is variable. Optional selector means 9,37 are provided so as to produce an either or effect between the push pull and turn modes of operation. A catch 51 61 which retains the tongue 2 in its retracted position when the door is open is also described. The catch 51 61 can be automatically released upon closure of the door.
