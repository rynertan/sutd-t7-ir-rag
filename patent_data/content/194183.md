## Description
This invention relates to an electrical connector, and more particularly to electrical connectors which can function under a large electromagnetic pulse EMP transients and which can function without interruption when subjected to shock and vibration. It is known to mount circuit components in a longitudinal notch in a contact in a ground plane opening, said ground plane being disposed between adjacent insulation planes, said insulation planes being perpendicular to the contact and having a passage aligned with said opening. In this case a bowed spring mechanically fixed on the circuit components makes electrical contact with the interior surface of the ground plane opening. For example, see the disclosure of and the prior art cited in GB A 2 137 437. In the past, electrical connectors of the type identified above have not suppressed transient voltage pulses between the contacts and shell ground. Such connectors have not been able to function without circuit interruption when subjected to shock and vibration. In accordance with the electrical connector of the present invention, the above described and other disadvantages of the prior art are overcome by providing a contact surrounded by an insulator which, in turn, is surrounded by a metal band. A spring holds this assembly in an opening through a ground plane. A semiconductor diode is electrically connected between the metal band and the contact. In the drawings, which are to be regarded as merely illustrative In the drawings, in Fig. 1, an electrical connector 10 is shown including a ceramic insulator 11. Insulator 11 surrounds a pin contact 12 except for a small opening 15 over a diode 16. The insulator 11 extends well into a front insulator 17 through a center insulator 18 and into a rear insulator 19. In doing so, it provides an electrical creepage path which is the element of construction that dielectric withstand voltage depends on to meet common levels of dielectric withstand voltage performance. The electrical circuit requirements are satisfied through use of a circumferential metal band 20 which contacts the diode 16 through opening 15 in the insulator 11. The band 20 is in circumferential contact with a conventional MULTILAM trademark spring 21 which is, in turn, in contact with metal ground plane 14. The spring 21 exerts a uniformly distributed load on the circumferential band 20 to assure non interrupted electrical contact during exposure to shock and vibration. The uniformly distributed load acts to prevent deflection of contact 12 during shock and at the harmonic frequencies of the contact during vibration. Any deflection which might occur will simply be reacted to by the spring 21 which will cause even greater assurance of a non interrupted circuit. Note in Figs. 2 and 3 that band 20 is flattened at 24 and that diode 16 is connected between band 20 and pin contact 12 in a notch 25 of the latter. A conventional retention clip 22 is also shown in Fig. 1. As is conventional, ground plane 14 is maintained in electrical contact with a conventional connector shell 23. There is a need to package the connector 10 in a high density layout. For example, the centerline to centerline dimension between contacts in a high density layout may be 2,388 mm. That is, there is a requirement for reduced centerline spacing. This requirement is satisfied by locating insulator 11 Figs. 4 and 5 and a circumferential metal band 20 in an area where their diameters can be reduced to an absolute minimum. These parts are, therefore, located near the engaging end of a pin contact 12 . The insulator 11 no longer covers diode 16 . Therefore, an entry hole similar to hole 15 of Fig. 1 is not provided in insulator 11 . Contrariwise, a notch 25 is provided as shown. However, the metal band 20 must now have an extension on it which spans the distance between the band 20 and the diode 16 . This extension is attached to the diode 16 to complete the electrical circuit. Diode 16 is connected to pin contact 12 at the bottom of notch 25 as shown in Fig. 5. Extension 26 may be fixed to or integral with band 20 . Springs 21 and 21 may be separate from or intergral with respective corresponding bands 20 and 20 . That is, springs 21, 21 and corresponding bands 20, 20 may be isotropic. For the function of diode 16 or other complex circuitry, see the copending application. Complex integrated circuits as circuit components, multiple independently mounted many contacts circuit components with multiple grounds may be employed with the present invention with fixed or removable contacts.
