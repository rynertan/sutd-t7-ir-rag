# Magnetic bubble transfer switch.

## Abstract
A magnetic bubble switch operates in a drive to transfer mode when a rotating magnetic field is applied. The switch has a magnetic element 10 in the shape that defines the letter Y having two arms 16, 18 and a stem 20 . The switch has at least one serration 24 on the arm 18 of the Y in the vicinity of the stem 20 and a conductor 14 which is positioned over the end 22 of the stem of the Y. Another magnetic element 30 is located at a distance 1.5w to 2.0w from the stem 20 . In the absence of current in said conductor 14 , a bubble positioned near the end 22 of said stem 20 is propagated to said serration 24 as the magnetic field rotates and then along the second arm 18 , and in the presence of current in said conductor 14 , a bubble positioned near the end 22 of said stem 20 is propagated outward away from said stem as the magnetic field rotates to said second magnetic element 30 .
