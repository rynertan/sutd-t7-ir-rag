# ULTRASONIC PROBE HAVING A LIQUID CONTAINING HOUSING FORMED OF POLYMETHYLPENTENE RESIN

## Abstract
Disclosed is an ultrasonic probe having a transducer submerged in an acoustic transmitting liquid medium con tained in a housing. The housing is formed of polymethyl pentene resin having an acoustic impedance approximately equal to that of the human body. Multiple reflections and transmission loss of acoustic energy are minimized to ensure high quality tomographic images.
