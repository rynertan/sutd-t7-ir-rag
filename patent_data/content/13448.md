# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO CYLINDRICAL BODIES HAVING FIXED COLLARS

## Abstract
A cold pressing process is used for fitting a cylindrical body with a fixed collar resistant to relative rotation at high shear stresses. The invention is specifically applied to a shell and a driv ing band 9 , the shell being provided with a keyed portion 2 having a plurality of axially parallel keys 7 each machined at one end face 6 to provide a cutting edge 8 . In assembly the collar is aligned with the keyed portion and axially pressed against the cutting edges so as to broach keyways in the collar which engage fully with the keys.
