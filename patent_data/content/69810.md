The novel compounds of the present invention are those having structural formula I or IA, above, where R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are as defined therein, with the proviso that R1, is not 5tetra zolyl, carboxy or carboxamido when R4 and R5, taken together, are 0 and R2 and R3 are hydrogen. Compounds in which R1 is 5 tetra zolyl, carboxy or carboxamido, R4 and R5, taken together, are 0 and R2 and 23 are hydrogen are known in the prior art as antiinflammatorv agents see J. Med. Chem., Vol. 21, No. 7, pp. 633 639, 1978 . Such compounds, although usable therapeutically, are not per se part of the invention. As used herein, the term halogen means chlorine, bromine, iodine or fluorine. The terms lower alkyl and lower alkoxy, wherever employed, and unless otherwise specified, mean straight and branched chain alkyl and alkoxy groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl or alkoxy residue such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, butyl, ethoxy, propoxy and isobutoxy. The term lower alkanoyl means straight and branched chain alkanoyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms including, for example, formyl, acetyl, propanoyl and butyryl.The term, aryl, is intended to includo phenyl and ring substituted phenyl such as, for example, ortho , meta , and paralower alkylphenyl, ortho , meta , and para halophenyl, ortho , meta , and para hydropyphenyl, ortho , meta , and para lower alkoxy phenyl, ortho , meta , and para nitrophenyl, ortho , meta , and para lower aikyithiophenyl, ortho , meta and para triflaoromethyl phenyl and the like. The instant invention is based upon applicants discovery that the exepins of Formula I andIA, above, markedly antagonize the actions of contractile prostaglandins such as PGF2a, PGG2, PGH and TXA . The use of the oxepins of this 2 2 invention, which act as prostaglandin antagonists, and biosynthesis inhibitors, offers a new approach to therapy in a variety of allergic conditions such as allergic asthma where excessive contractile activity of prostaglandins and prostaglandin biosynthetic intermediates occur.It is well known, for example, that prostaglandins such as PGF2, PGG2, TXA2 and PGH2 are potent contractants of bronchial muscle and that human asthmatics are especially sensitive to the bronchial constricting action of PGF The antagonizing action of the oxepins of this invention against the constricting actions of contractile prostaglandins has been confirmed in vitro and in vivo using standard pharmacological techniques. It is contemplated, therefore, that the oxepins of this invention will be employed in dosage unit form as the essential active ingredient in pharmaceutical formulations intended for the treatment and control of allergic conditions such as asthma in humans and warm blooded animals. 9 TXA2 is the commonly used abbreviation for thromboxan A2. The novel 6, 11 dinydro 11 oxidibenz b,e oxepins of this invention, conveniently, are prepared from the 2 or 9 cyano intermediates having the following structural formulae EMI5.1 wherein R2 and R3 are as previously defined. These 2 or 9 cyano 6 , ll dihydro ll oxodibenz i, oxepin intermediates are themselves readily prepared from well known starting materials which are either available commercially or may be prepared by conventional techniques already fully described in the chemical literature. Thus, 2 cyano 6, 11 dihydro 11 oxodibenz oxepin 11 may be prepared according to the following general reaction scheme EMI6.1 wherein R2 and R2 are as previously defined, by treating an appropriately substituted R2 and orR3 o toluic acid with thionyl chloride in order to obtain the corresponding acid chloride which then is treated with methanol or any desired lower alkanol in order to obtain the corresponding methyl or lower alkyl ester. The ester then is ref fluxed with N bromosuccinimide to form the corresponding methyl or lower alkyl a bromo o toluate which is reacted with bromophenol in order to obtain the corresponding methyl or lower alkyl o p bromophenoxymethyl benzoate. Hydrolysis of this compound yields the corresponding o E bromo phenoxymethyl benzoic acid. Cyclization of the acid with trifluoroacetic anhydride in the presence of boron trifluoride ether complex yields the corresponding 2 bromo 6,11 dihydro ll oxodibenz Eb,ei oxepin. The cyano group is introduced by treating the 2 bromo compound under reflux inN,N dimethylformamide with cuprous cyanide to form the desired R2 and or R substituted 2 cyano 6,11 dihydro 11 oxodibenz tbedoxepin of Formula II. 9 Cyano,ll dihydro ll oxodibenz b,e oxepin IIA may be prepared according to the following general reaction scheme EMI8.1 wherein R2 and R3 are as previously defined, by reacting o toluic acid with bromine in the presence of iron powder in order to obtain 5 bromo o toluic acid.The product obtained from the reaction mixture is predominately the desired 5 bromo isomer although some 3 bromo isomer may be present. If desired, pure 5 bromo isomer can be separated by conventional techniques and employed in pure form as the starting material for subsequent steps. Separation, however, is unnecessary and the product obtained from the reaction mixture usually is employed in the next step without further purification. The 5 bromo acid then is treated with methanol or any desired lower alk.anol in the presence of a strong acid such as sulfuric acid to form methyl or lower alkyl ester which then is treated withN bromosuccinimide in the presence of benzcyl per oxide under reflux to form methyl or lower alkyl a,5 dibromo o toluate.The dibromo ester then is reacted with an appropriately substituted R2 and orR3 phenol in the presence of dimethylformamide and potassium carbonate to obtain the corresponding methyl or lower alkyl 5 bromo R2 and or R3 substituted phenoxy o toluate. Hydrolysis of the ester with methanol and solium hydroxide yields, on acidification, the free acid when is cyclized in the presence of trifluoroacetic anhydrdride and boron trifluoride ethyl ether complex to form the corresponding 9 bromo 6,11 dihydro 11 oxodibenzlb,e oxepin. The cyano group is introduced as previously described by treating the 9 bromo compound with cuprous cyanide inthe presence of dimethylformamide in order to obtain the desired R2 and or R3 substituted 9 cyano 6,11 dihydro 11 oxodibenzlb,e oxepin of formula IIA. The novel 6,11 dihydro 11 oxidibenz b,e oxepins of the instant invention wherein the substituent at the 2 or 9 position is carboxy are prepared by refluxing the 2 or 9 cyano intermediates of formula II or IIA in a mixture of aqueous hydrochloric acid and glacial acetic acid, The reaction usually requires from 18 to 160 hours for completion and the desired 6,11 dihydro 11 oxodibenztb,e oxepin 2 or 9 carboxylic acid of formula III or IIIA is recovered from the reaction mixture upon cooling.EMI10.1 The novel 6,11 dihydro 11 oxibenz b,e oxepins of this invention wherein the substituent at the 2 or 9 position is 5 tetrazolyl also are prepared from the 2 or 9 cyano intermediates of formula II or IlA.

EMI11.1 Those 6,11 dihydro 11 oxodibenz b,e oxepins of this invention wherein the substituent at the 2 or 9 position is 3 hydroxy 1,2,5 thiadiazol 4 yl are prepared by refluxing the 2 or 9 cyano intermediate of formula II or IIA in formic acid in the presence ofRaney nickel alloy for 1 to 2 hours.in order to obtain the corresponding 6,11 dihydro 11 oxodibenz i, ejoxepin 2 or 9 carboxaldehyde. The aldehyde product then is converted into the corresponding 2 or 9 2aminoacetonitrile by treatment with sodium cyanide in an alcoholic solvent saturated with ammonia and in the presence of ammonium chloride and ammonium hydroxide. The reaction usually is conducted at room temperature and requires from 8 to 16 hours for completion.The aminoacetonitrile so produced is treated with concentrated hydrochloric acid at room temperature for 20 to 45 minutes in order to obtain the corresponding 2 or 9 2 aminoacetamide which then is treated with sulfur monochloride in dimethylformamide to obtain the desired 2 or 9 3 hydroxy 1,2,5 thiadiazol 4 yl 6,11 dihydro 11 oxodibenzLb,eoxepin of formula XX and XXA. This reaction sequence is illustrated in the following diagram, it being understood that position of the 3 hydroxy 1,2,5 thiadiazol 4 yl substituent in the final product depends upon the selection of the appropriate 2 or 9 cyano starting material.EMI13.1 Those 6,11 dihydro 11 oxocibenz b,e oxepins of this invention wherein the substituent at the 2 position is 4 hydroxy 3 pyrrolin 2, 5 dione 3 yl may be prepared according to the following general reaction scheme EMI14.1 wherein R2 and R3 are as previously defined, by treating an appropriately substituted R2 and or R3 phthalide with the disodium salt of p hydroxyphenylacetic acid at 170 25O0C. for 2 3 hours to obtain the corresponding 4 2 carboxybenzyloxy phenylacetic acid.The disodium salt of p hydroxyphenylacetic acid is formed by treating the acid with aqueous sodium hydroxide and evaporating the mixture to dryness.The phthalide is then added and the reaction is carried out as described above. The carboxybenzyloxyphenylacetic acid so produced then is cyclized by stirring with trifluoroacetic anhydride in a pressure bottle at 70 80 C. for 1 3 hours. The intermediate R2 and or R3 substituted 6, ll dihydro 11 oxodibenzo Lb, e oxepin 2 acetic acid trifluoroacetic acid mixed anhydride then is treated with base and acidified in order to obtain the free acid. The free acid then is treated with thionyl chloride followed by ammonia to form the corresponding acetamide which is treated with diethyl Oxalate in dimethylformamide in the presence of potassium t butoxide to form the desired R2 and or R3 substituted 2 4 hydroxy b3 pyrrolin 2,5 dione 3 yl 6,11 dihydro 11 oxodibenz ib,egoxepin of formula VI.

In addition to their therapeutic properties as noted above, the 2 or 9 carboxylic acid derived tives of this invention serve as valuable inter mediates in the preparation of other R1 substituted 6.11 dihydro 11 oxodibenz b,e oxepins of formula I and IA. Thus, the 2 or91 carboxylic acid of formula III or IIIA may be converted readily into the corresponding acid halide, preferably the acid chloride, by treating the carboxylic acid with a thionyl halide, preferably thionyl chloride.The resulting 2 or 9 halocarbonyl 6, ll dihydro ll oxodibenztb,e oxepin i.e., the 2 or 9 chlorocarbonyl compounds of formula VII or VIIA then may be treated with various well known reagents to form desired ester and amide derivatives. EMI19.1 Thus, for example, the chlorocarbonyl compounds of formula VII and VIIA may be treated a with a lower alkanol such as, for example, methanol, ethanol, 2 propanol, butanol and 2 butanol, to form the corresponding loweralkyl esters, VII andVIIA EMI20.1 b with ammonia to form the corresponding carboxamides, IX and IXA EMI20.2 c with an N loweralkylamine such as, for example, methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, isopropylamine and butylamine, or an N,N diloweralkylamine such as, for example, dimethylamine, diethylamine, dipropylamine and dibutylamine, to form the corresponding N loweralkylcarboxamide X or XA, or N,N diloweralkylcarboxamide, XI or XIA EMI21.1 d with lower alkylsulfonamide to form the corresponding N lower alkylsulfonyl carboxamide, XII andXIIA EMI22.1 e with 2 imino 3 methylthiazolidine to form the correaponding 3 methyl 2 thiazolidinylidene carboxamide, XIII and XIIIA EMI23.1 f with a loweralkyldiol such as, for example, ethylene glycol, trimethylene glycol and, 4 butanediol, to form the corresponding hydroxyloweralkyl ester, XIV and XIVA EMI24.1 g with an N,N diloweralkylaminoloweralkanol such as, for example, N,N dimethylethanolamine, N,Ndiethylethanolamine, 3 N,N dimethylamino propan l ol and 4 N,N diethylamino butan l ol, to form the corresponding N ,N diloweralkylaminoloweralkyl esterXVII and XVIIA EMI25.1 h with an amino acid such as, for example, glycine, alkaline and valine, to form the corresponding N carboxy loweralkylcarboxamide, XVIII and XVIIIA EMI26.1 i with an alkali metal salt of a hydroxyloweralkanoic acid such as, for example, hydroxyacetic acid, 3 hydroxy butyric acid and B hydroxy propionic acid, to form the corresponding carboxyloweralkyl ester, XIX and XIXA EMI27.1 Those 6,11 dihydrodibenztb,e oxepins of formula I and IA wherein R4 is hydroxy and R5 is hydrogen e.g., 6, 11 dihydro ll hydroxydibenz b,e oxepins are readily prepared by treating the corresponding ll oxo compound R1, R2 and R3 are as previously defined with a reducing agent. Thus, for example, the 2 or 9 lH tetrazol 5 yl 6,11 dihydro ll oxodibenz b,e oxepins of formula IV orIVA may be treated with sodium borohydride usually at room temperature in a suitable organic solvent such as ethanol.Upon diluting the reaction mixture with water and acidification the desired 2 or 9 1H tetrazol 5 yl 6, 11 dihydro 11 hydroxydibenz lb,e oxepin formula XXX or XXXA is isolated.Similarly, the 2 or 9 carboxylic acid of formula III or IIIA, preferably in the form of a lower alkyl ester of formula VIII or VIIIA, may be reduced to the corresponding 11 hydroxy compound from which the ester group is removed by hydrolysis to form the 6,11 dihydro ll hydroxydibenz b,e oxepin 2 or 9 carboxylic acid of formula XXXII or XXXI IA.

The ll chloro intermediate may be isolated and employed per se as the starting material for subsequent conversions. If desired, however, the 11chloro intermediate may be formed in situ and employed in subsequent reactions without isolation. Thus, for example, the 2 or 9 carboxylic acid of Formula III or IIIA, preferably in the form of a lower alkyl ester of Formula VIII or VIIIA, may be ref lured with thionyl chloride in order to form the corresponding 6,11 dihydro ll chlorodibenz b,e oxepin 2 or 9 loweralkyl carboxylate.

About a 10 excess of the salt is employed and the reaction is run at room temperature. About 3 to about 6 days usually is required to complete the reaction. After dilution with water, the product is recovered by filtration and purified by conventional recrystallization. Thus, for example, the 6,11 dihydro ll chlorodibenz b,e oxepin 2 or 9 lower alkyl carboxylate of Formula XXXIII or XXXIIIA may be treated with methanesulfinic acid sodium salt in dimethylformamide in order to obtain the corresponding 6,11 dihydro ll methyl sulfonyldibenz b,e oxepin 2 or 9 lower alkyl carboxylate Formula XXXIV or XXXIVA which may be hydrolyzed by conventional techniques in order to obtain the free acid of Formula XXXV or XXXVA.EMI31.1 EMI32.1 Preparation of the ll loweralkylthio compound of formula I and IA R1, R2 and R3 are as previously defined is achieved by treating the corresponding 11chloro intermediate in dimethylformamide with a lower alkylthiol. The reaction conveniently is run at room temperature and usually requires from 1 to 3 hours for completion. The product is recovered by extraction into ether, washing with base, drying and evaporation to dryness. Thus, for example, the 6,11 dihydro ll chloro dibenz b,e oxepin 2 or 9 lower alkyl carboxylate of formula XXXIII or XXXIII A may be treated in dry dimethylformamide solution with methanethiol at room temperae ture in order to obtain the corresponding 6,11 dihydro ll methylthiodibenz b,e oxepin 2 or 9 lower alkyl carboxylate of formula XXXVI or XXXVI A. The ester, by conventional hydrolysis, may be converted to the free acid of formula XXXVII or XXXVII A. EMI33.1 Where ll aryl thio derivatives are desired, it is necessary only to substitute an arylthiol for the lower alkylthiol employed in the foregoing reaction.Thus, for example, by substituting phenylthidl or a ring substituted phenyithiol, such as for example an ortho ,meta or para lower alkyl, halo, hydroxy, lower alkylthio or trifluoromethylphenyl thiol for the lower alkyl thiol employed above the corresponding ll phenylthio ll substituted phenylthio compounds are obtained. Oxidation of the ll lower alkylthio compounds described above affords the corresponding ll lower alkylsulfinyl derivatives of Formula I or IA R1 and R3 are as described above . The ll lower alkylthio compounds may be oxidized with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of an acidic solvent such as acetic acid or with organic peroxides such as peroxy acids including, for example, m chloroperbenzoic acid and the like. A 1 1 molar ratio of oxidant to reductant produces the desired lower alkylsulfinyl compound.For example, the 6,11 dihydro 11 methylthiodibenz b,e3oxepin 2 or 9 carboxylic acid of formula XXXVII and XXXVII A in acetic acid solution may be treated with 30 hydrogen peroxide to obtain the corresponding 6,11 dihydro 11 methylsulfinyl dibenz b, e oxepin 2 carboxylic acid of formula XXXVIII and XXXVIII A.EMI34.1 In a similar manner, the ll chloro intermediate of formula I and I A R1, R2 and R3 are as previously defined may be treated with methanethiol potassium salt formed in situ from potassium tertbutoxide and methanethiol with a loweralkanol, such as for example methanol, ethanol, propanol, iso propanol, n butanol and the like, in the presence of potassium tert butoxide and with imidazole to form, respectively, the corresponding ll unsubstituted R4 and R5 are hydrogen , the ll lower alkoxy and the ll imidazolyl compounds of formula I and I A. The ll chloro intermediate of formula I and IA R1, R2 and R3 are as previously defined also may be treated with formamide in order to obtain the corresponding ll formamido compound which then may be subjected to conventional hydrolysis to obtain the corresponding ll amino compound. Thus, for example, the 6,11 dihydro ll chlorodibenz b,e oxepin 2 or 9 lower alkyl carboxylate of formula XXXIII or XXXIIIA may be heated with formamide at 100 to 1200C. for 2 4 hours, cooled, diluted with water and filtered to obtain the corresponding 6,11 dihydro 11 formamidodibenz b,e oxepin 2 or 9 lower alkyl carboxylate of formula XXXIX andXXXIXA. Acid hydrolysis of these compounds, where desired, yields the ll amino compounds.Where the hydrolysis is carried out under mild conditions dilute aqueous acid such as 5 15 hydrochloric acid and moderate temperature such as 35 500C. , hydrolysis occurs on at the ll formamido group resulting in the formation of the corresponding 6,11 dihydro ll amino dibenz b,e oxepin 2 or 9 lower alkyl carboxylate of formula XL and XLA. Under more vigorous conditions concentrated acid such as concentrated hydrochloric acid and more elevated temperature such as 80 to 1000C. , hydrolysis occurs at both the formamido group and the ester group resulting in the formation of the corresponding 6,11 dihydro ll aminodibenz b,e oxepin 2 or 9 carboxylic acid of formula XLI and XLIA.Regeneration of the formamido group on the free amino acid is readily achieved by treating the free amino acid with formicacetic anhydride in the presence of formic acid which results in the formation of the corresponding 6,11dihydro 11 formamido b,e oxepin 2 or 9 carboxylic acid of formula XLII or XLIIA.EMI36.1 The ll hydroxy ll loweralkyl compounds of formula I and Ia R1, R2 and R3 are as previously defined may be prepared by treating the corresponding 2 or 9 carboxylic acid, preferably in the form of a lower alkyl ester, with a suitable Grignard reagent such as for example methyl magnesium iodide, ethyl magnesium bromide, iso propyl magnesium iodide, propyl magnesium iodide, n butyl magnesium bromide and the like, and hydrolyzing the resulting lower alkyl carboxylate to form the free acid. Thus, for example, the 6,11 dihydro 11 oxodibenz b,e 2 or 9 lower alkyl carboxylate of formula VIII or VIIIA may be treated with methyl magnesium iodide to form the corresponding 6 ,ll dihydro ll hydroxy ll lower alkyldibenz b,e oxepin2 or 9 lower alkyl carboxylate of formula XLIII orXLIIIA which then is hydrolyzed to form the corresponding 2 or 9 carboxylic acid of formula XLIV or XLIVA.EMI37.1 The ll hydroxy ll loweralkyl 2 or 9 lower alkyl carboxylates as prepared above may be heated with benzene in the presence of p toluenesulfonic acid to form the corresponding ll alkylidene 2 or 9 lower alkyl carboxylates of formula I or Ia Rl, R2 and R3 are as previously defined which, upon hydrolysis, yield the corresponding free acids. Reduction of the free acids yield the corresponding ll methyl compounds.Thus, for example, the 6,11 dihydro ll hydroxy ll methyldibenztb,e oxepin 2 or 9 lower alkyl carboxylate of formula XLIII or XLII IA may be heated with benzene in the presence of p toluenesulfonic acid to form the corresponding ll methylene derivative of formula XLV orXLVA which may be hydrolyzed to form the free acids of formula XLVI or XLVIA and then reduced catalytically to form the corresponding 11 methyl derivatives of formulaXLVII and XLVIIA.EMI38.1 EMI39.1 Other ll lower alkylidene compounds of formulaI or IA R1, R2, and R3 are as previously defined may be prepared by treating the corresponding 2 or 9 cyano 6,11 dihydro 11 oxodibenz b,e oxepin of formulaII or IIA with a lower alkyl triphenylphosphonium bromide in the presence of tert. butyllithium. The 2 or 9 cyano group then may be converted to the 2 or 9 carboxylic acid, 2 or 9 tetrazolyl or other desired R1 group by methods described above. Substituting a lower alkyiphenyl or a ring substituted lower alkylphenyl triphenylphosphonium bromide for the lower alkyl triphenylphosphonium bromide results in the formation of the corresponding ll phenylloweralkylidene or ll ring substituted phenylloweralkylidene compounds. As noted above, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the novel oxepins of this invention also are included within the scope of this invention. The term, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, is intended to include salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic acids and bases such as, for example, ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as magnesium and calcium salts, salts of organic bases such as amine salts derived from mono , di and triloweralkyl or loweralkanoyl amines such as trimethylamine, dimethylamine and triethanolamine, salts derived from heterocyclic amines such as piperidine, 1 methylpiperazine, piperazine and morpholine, and salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, tartaric acid and propionic acid. The oxepins of formula I and IA are useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of human or warm blooded animal disease conditions where excessive undesirable contractile activity of prostaglandins, such as PGF or prostaglandin biosynthetic intermediates contribute.In particular, they are of value in the treatment and control of allergic conditions such as asthma. The magnitude of a prophylactic or therapeutic dose of compound of formula I and IA will, of course, vary with the nature and the severity of the condition to be treated and with the particular compound of formulaI and IA and its route of administration. In general, the dose range lies within the range of 0.2 mg. to 100 mg. per kg. body weight per day. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a compound of formula I and IA as an active ingredient, and may also contain pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The compositions include compositions suitable for oral, rectal, opthalmic, pulmonary, nasal, dermal, topical or parenteral including subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated and on the nature of the active ingredient. They may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. For use where a composition for intravenous administration is employed, a suitable dosage range is from 0.2 to 25 mg. preferably 2 to 15 mg of a compound of formula I and IA per kg. of body weight per day and in the case where an oral composition is employed a suitable dosage range is about, e.g., 1 to 60 mg. of a compound of formula I and IA per kg. of body weight per day, preferably from 10 to 40 mg. kg. Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for oral administration and by inhalation in the case of asthma therapy may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a pre determined amount of the active ingredient as a powder or granules or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid, or a non aqueous liquid, an oil in water emulsion or a waterin oil liquid emulsion. Such compositions may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy but all methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation.For example, a tablet may be prepared by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine, the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, lubricating, surface active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine, a mixture of powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. Desirably, each tablet contains from 50 mg. to 500 mg. of the active ingredient and each cachet or capsule contains from 50 mg. to 500 mg. of the active ingredient.
