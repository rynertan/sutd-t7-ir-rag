# Machine for automatically roughing the cement margin of a footwear upper assembly.

## Abstract
A machine 101 for automatically roughing the cement margin 103 of a footwear upper assembly 104 . The machine includes means 51 for supporting the footwear upper assembly 104 by a mechanism 4,5,6 capable of applying to the upper assembly 104 rocking movement, translational movement, and rotational movement. A roughing tool 41 is provided, as well as means for applying a combination movement to the upper assembly. Simul taneously, roughing is effected along the shoe margin 103 by the roughing tool 41 . The combination of movements serves continuously to present a new roughing surface to the roughing tool 41 in the course of roughing, resulting in uniformity of roughing. The rotational movement serves to cause the roughing tool 41 to track the cement margin 103 with a determined orientation therebetween as the cement margin 103 moves past the roughing portion 41A of the roughing tool 41 .
