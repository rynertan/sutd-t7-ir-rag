# Method for the preparation of an alkali metal benzoate together with benzyl alcohol.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method for the preparation of a pure alkali metal benzoate, specifically of a pure alkali metal benzoate from benzyl benzoate prepared by oxidation of an alkyl benzene compound, specifically toluene, with a gas containing molecular oxygen, besides benzyl alcohol. Very specifically the invention relates to a method for the preparation of sodium benzoate besides benzyl alcohol. For this purpose crude benzyl benzoate is subjected to a treatment with a reducing substance to convert impurities, under such circumstance that, in the process, there will be no conversion of any substantial quantity of benzyl benzoate. Subsequently the benzyl benzoate is saponified to the alkali metal benzoate and benzyl alcohol.
