# FLASHING

## Abstract
A flashing includes a resiliently compressible flbre rein forced silicone sheet 10 having substantial vapour permeabil ity and water resistance pre assembled with a pair of ductile non corrodable strips 20, 21 embedded in edges of the sheet 10. The flashing is fixed by headed self drilling fasteners 16 to facilitate installation in metal buildings. Seals are created under the heads of the fasteners 16 around the points of fastening and between the strips 20, 21 and the structure 12, 14 by the resiliently compressible sheet 10.
