## Description
FIBER REACTIVE NAVY DISAZO DYESTUFFSThe present invention provides water soluble, fiber reactive monoazo dyestuffs, and liquid compositions thereof.In GB PS 1,200,096, there is disclosed, in Example 8, a reactive dyestuff of the formulaEMI1.1 which is said to provide black dyeings having good fastness properties. Sitnilar dyestuffs are known from German Offenlegungsschrift Nos. 3,113,989 and 3,113,885, which are methoxy and or methyl substituted in one of the diazo com ponent 5. Applicants have now found new, water soluble fiber reactive dyestuffs of the general formula 1 EMI1.2 wherein M is hydrogen or an alkali metal, such as sodium, potassium cr lithium, or the equivalent of an alkaline earth metal, such as of calcium, and both X, being different from each other or preferably identical to each other, represent the vinyl group or a group of the general formula 2 CH2 CH2 Z 2 in which Z is hydroxy, chlorine, bromine, sulfato of the formula OS03M with N being defined as above , thiosulfato of the formula S S03M with M being defined as above , phosphato of the formula OPO3M2 with N being defined as above , acetyloxy, propionyloxy or di lower alkyl amino, but with the proviso that both X are not ss sulfatoethyl simultaneously.Liquid compositions containing 5 to 45 of said dyestuff in water are also provided.The berm lower means that the group indicated so, con tainC 1 to B C tc.s. The dyestuff of the present invention can be prepared according to a process of the invention by coupling the 1 amino 8 hydroxy naphthalene 3,6 disulfonic acid, or a salt thereof, preferably an alkali metal salt thereof, first with a diazotized amino compound of the formula 3 EMI2.1 in which X is defined as above, and then with a diazotized amino compound of the general formula 4 EMI2.2 in which X is defined as above, while employing the conventional coupling conditions for preparing disazo dyestuffs of the 1 amino 8 hydroxy 3,6 disulfo naphthalene coupling component.Both diazo components can be added to the coupling component separately, the second diazo component being added after the formation of the monoazo compound had been finished, or, advantageously, simultaneously to conduct the coupling reactions in a one pot process according toGerman Offenlegungsschrift No. 3,113,885, which is incorporated herein by reference. The first coupling step is carried out at a pH value of 0 to 3.5, the second at a pHvalue of It to 7. The coupling reactions can be conducted at a temperature of 50C to 250C.After preparation, the dyestuff may be isolated as a powder, either by salting it out of solution or by spray drying, and brought to standard strength by the addition of inorganic salt, generally sodium sulfate. Advantageously, the prepared dyestuff may be used directly as a liquid composition after standardizing with water. Such liquid compositions will contain from 5 to 45 by weight of the water soluble dyestuff of the present invention, preferably 10 to 20 , and water. Said liquid composition may also optionally contain from 0 to 10 , preferably 0 to 6 , of inert inorganic salt, typically the alkali metal lithium, sodium, potassium and ammonium chlorides and sulfates and mixtures thereof.While said liquid composition may also optionally contain up to 5 of buffer substances, it is preferred that the composition remain substantially free of a buffer. It is also preferred that liquid compositions of the dyestuff having the A sulfatoethylsulfonyl group be maintained at a p of from about 2.5 to about 4.5 for maximum stability.The. dyestuff of the present invention is suitable for the dyeing of cellulosic materials such as cotton, linen, viscose rayon or staple fibers. It can be applied by any one of the usual dyeing and printing methods tor reactive dye stuffs and yields on cellulosic materials, in the presence of alkaline agents, brilliant navy shades having excellent fastness and levelling properties, and particularly superior color yield and build up ratio of dyestuff concentration to color intensity as well as chlorine resistance and resistance to alkaline hydrolysis. The present dyestuffs may also be used on wool, silk or polyamide fibers.The invention may be further ilustrated by the followingExamples in which the parts and percentages are by weight. EXAMPLE 1 17.3 Parts of 1 aminobenzene It vnylsulfone were diazotized at O to 50C in 150 parts by volume of water and 30 parts of an aqueous 31 d hydrochloric acid with 18 parts of an aqueous 40 sodium nitrite solution. Subsequently, 32.4 parts of 1 amino 8 hydroxynaphthalene 3,6 disulfonic acidmonosodium salt were added to the diazo suspension and coupled at a ph value of 1 to 2. After completion of the reaction, the pH was adjusted to 6.0 by adding an aqueous 15 sodium carbonate solution.31.2 parts of 2 amino 1 methoxybenzene 4 ss sulfatoethyl sulfone were diazotized at O to 50C in 150 parts of water and 20 parts by weight of an aqueous 31 hydrochloric acid with 18 parts by weight of an aqueous 40 sodium nitrite solution. This diazo component was then slowly added to the previously prepared monoazo dyestuff while maintaining the coupling reaction at a pH value of 6.0 to 6.5 by addition of sodium carbonate.The resulting solution was spray dried to yield a dyestuff powder containing beside inorganic sulfate salts and inorganic chloride salts electrolytes the alkali metal salt of the formula EMI5.1 which is well suitable as dyestuff as described above.Alternatively, the dyestuff solution before spray drying can be converted to a liquid dyestuff solution by the addition of water and adjusting the pH to 2.5 to 4.5. EXAMPLE 2 17.3 Parts of 1 aminobenzene 4 vinylsulfone were diazotized at O to 5 C in 150 parts by volume of water and 30 parts of an aqueous 31 hydrochloric acid with 18 parts of an aqueous 40 sodium nitrite solution. Subsequently, 32.parts of 1 amino 8 hydroxynaphthalene 3,6 disulfonic acid monosodium salt were added to the diazo suspension and coupled at a pH value of 1 to 2. After completion of the reaction, the pH was adjusted to 6.0 by adding an aqueous 15 sodium carbonate solution. 21.3 Parts of 2 amino 1 methoxy benzene 4 vinylsulfone were diazotized at O to 50C in 150 parts of water and 30 parts of an aqueous 31 hydrochloric acid by means of 18 parts of an aqueous 40 sodium nitrite solution in the conventional manner. This diazo component was then slowly added to the previously prepared monoazo dyestuff while maintaining the coupling reaction at a pH value of 6.0 to 6.5 by addition of sodium carbonate.The resulting solution was spray dried to yield a dyestuff powder containing beside inorganic sulfate salts and in organic chloride salts electrolytes the alkali metal salt of the formulaEMI6.1 which is well suitable as dyestuff as described above.Examples 3 to 6Further disazo dyestuffs according to the inventin can be prepared according to the processes of the invention, for example analogously to Examples 1 or 2, by replacing one or botn of the diazo components of the dyestuffs of Examples 1 or 2 by another or two other diazo component Or the general formula 3 or 4 or both. Such dyestuffs according to the irvention are, for example, descried in the following Table they are marked in form of their free acids and are preferably in form of the alkali metal salts, such as sodium, potassium or lithium salts. They have also good fibre reactive dyestuff properties, and they yield,by application and fixation methods conventional in the dyeing and printing technique for fibre reactive dyestuffs, on the materials mentioned In the description part, brilliant navy dyeings and prints having good fastness properties, as mentioned in the description part.
