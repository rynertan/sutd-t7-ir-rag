# HIGH PRESSURE SWIVEL ASSEMBLIES

## Abstract
A multi passage swivel assembly, of particular use in floating oil production systems, provides fluid or gas flow while continuous or intermittent rotation occurs between a fixed inlet port e.g. a bore 26 in a fixed arbour 24 connected to a riser, and a rotating outlet port 32 . The assembly contains clearance control rings 34, 36 that compensate for dimensional changes to allow high pressure operation. In operation, structural deflection of the control ring allows its inside surface to maintain contact with the surface of the arbour.
