# Continuous molding machine for producing chains of soil plugs.

## Abstract
A continuous molding machine 10 for forming two chains 55 of soil plugs 50 for use in germinating seeds or otherwise growing plants. A continuous sheet of paper 22 is corrugated to conform to a series of mold elements 14 and a slurry 32 of resin and soil mix is added over the paper to conform to the mold element shape. Another sheet of paper 38 is added over the top of the slurry 32 and the entire assembly is then passed under a series of pressure belts 42, 44, 46 during which time the slurry 32 is cured. The chain of soil plugs 50 which emerges from the pressure belts 42, 44, 46 is encased on both sides by paper 22, 38 and may be cut to provide a pair of separate soil plug chains 55 .
