# Recovering chlorinated polymers from solution.

## Abstract
A process for recovering a chlorinated polymer of low residual solvent content, preferably less than 1 by weight, from solution in a chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent which comprises treating the solution with steam or hot water thereby separating the chlorinated polymer in solid form in the presence of a minor amount of both a chlorinated paraffin and an aliphatic alcohol containing at least 8 carbon atoms.
