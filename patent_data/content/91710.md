## Abstract
A unipolar hot electron or hot hole transistor has its base region 3 or and collector region 4,5 electrically contacted and extended to the semiconductor body surface by a metal silicide region 23 or 25 which extends through a silicon surface region 1,2 belonging to either the transistor emitter or the emitter base barrier. The metal silicide region 23 or 25 forms an isolating Schottky barrier with an adjacent semiconductor portion 1,2,4 or 6 . Preferably the surface region 1,2 is divided into separate first and second portions 1 and 2 by the base contacting metal silicide region 23 , with the emitter base barrier 13 and base collector barrier 34 terminating at one or more sides in this metal silicide region 23 . The isolating Schottky barriers are good quality unipolar diodes so avoiding minority charge carrier storage effects in these unipolar transistors, while the metal silicide region 23 or 25 can form good ohmic contacts to highly conductive base and collector regions 3 and 5 which typically comprise a highly doped semiconductor layer or a metal silicide layer.
