# A vehicle speed control apparatus.

## Abstract
A vehicle speed control apparatus is provided which includes a vehicle speed sensor 51 , a setting switch 53 , a memory 211, 212, 262 , a comparator 242, 251, 252 , a timer 263 269 , a quick responser 271, 272, 252 and an actuator 10 . The vehicle speed sensor 51 detects and outputs the actual vehicle speed into the memory 211, 212, 262 and the comparator 242, 251, 252 . A driver operates the setting switch 53 when the actual vehicle speed equals the desired vehicle speed. The setting switch 53 outputs an initial signal for automatic control of the vehicle speed to the memory 211, 212, 262 and the quick responser 271, 272, 252 . The value of the desired vehicle speed is set in the memory 211, 212, 262 which outputs a desired vehicle speed signal to the comparator 242, 251, 252 and the timer 263 269 . The com parator 242, 251, 252 determines a difference between the actual vehicle speed and the desired vehicle speed, and out puts a manipulation signal into the actuator 10 in accor dance with this difference. When the quick responser 271, 272, 252 receives the initial signal from the setting switch 53 it outputs a maximum value signal to the actuator 10 during a time period which is set in the memory 211 ,212, 262 according to a relationship between desired vehicle speed and time period. The actuator 10 opens a throttle valve 22 to a maximum degree during this time period. The timer 263 269 receives the desired vehicle speed signal from the memory 211, 212, 262 , and counts down the corres ponding time period. When the time period has passed and the time 263 269 reaches Zero , the timer 263 269 out puts an end signal to the quick responser 271, 272, 252 . The actuator 10 then adjusts the opening degree of the throttle valve 22 according to the difference between the value of the desired vehicle speed and the value of the actual vehicle speed. This provides automatic control of vehicle speed without large initial decreases or increases in vehicle speed.
