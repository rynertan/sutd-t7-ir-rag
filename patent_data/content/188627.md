# APPARATUS FOR RECORDING AND OR REPRODUCING OPTICAL CARDS.

## Abstract
An apparatus for recording optical cards wherein an inspection word based upon an error correction code is added to a data signal that is to be recorded, and signals which have been scrambled are recorded in the form of a block that can be optically read onto a belt like optical recording medium of a card at intervals of a predetermined number of words that are distributed for a data track, and or an apparatus for reproducing optical cards wherein signals that are read from the thus recorded optical card by a card reader, are unscrambled thereby to reproduce the original data signals. Scrambling consists, for example, of so ar ranging the words that each is delayed by two words in the data track direction and that they are delayed by k tracks where k is an integer, in the direction perpendicular to the data track, and placing the word at the head of the block at a position of a word number of which the phase is shifted by one word from the word number at the head of the block when the word that has reached the end of the data track is to be wrapped around to the other end and delayed, and then delaying each word by two words in the data track direction.
