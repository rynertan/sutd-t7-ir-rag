# Bit line powered translinear memory cell.

## Abstract
A bit line powered translinear memory cell includes a pair of NPN transistors having cross coupled bases and collectors. Diode loads couple the NPN transistors and to the bit lines. The emitters of the two transistors are coupled together and to a word line. Cell parasitic capacitances are used to maintain data in nonaddressed memory cells during reading of other cells coupled to the same word line.
