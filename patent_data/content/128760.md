# Thermal recording head.

## Abstract
An improved thermal head for thermal recording includes an array of a plurality of heat generator elements 101 ar ranged in a direction, and a plurality of semiconductor chips 201 each thereof including a plurality of transistors 112 for selectively energizing the plural heat generator elements. An array of electrode terminals 201a including the individual electrode terminals of the plural transistors each thereof being connected to one electrode of each of the plural heat generator elements are formed on one of the major surfaces of each of the semiconductor chips in a direction substantially perpendicular to the direction of the heat generator element array. The ther mal head further comprises a flexible film 202 associated with each of the semiconductor chips and having a slot or a re cess 202H surrounding the electrode terminal array. One of major surfaces of the flexible film is placed on the major surface of the semiconductor chip on which the electrode terminal ar ray is disposed, and a plurality of leads 202a, 202b having one end thereof connected respectively to the electrode termi nals are disposed on the other major surface of the flexible film substantially in parallel with the heat generator element array. By virtue of the above structure, the thermal head is suitable for thermal recording with a high recording density and it can be manufactured at a low cost.
