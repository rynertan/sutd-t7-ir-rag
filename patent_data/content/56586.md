# Method for manufacturing gallium phosphide single crystals.

## Abstract
A gallium phosphide single crystal 13 is prepared from a polycrystalline gallium phosphide powder as a starting raw material which is obtained by hydrogen reduction of gallium phosphate and which contains residual phosphate radicals in an amount of 0.03 to 0.5 by weight. The gallium phosphide powder is compressed to prepare a green compact which is then melted to provide a gallium phosphide liquid 17 . The gallium phosphide liquid 17 is brought into contact with a seed crystal 19 and is pulled.
