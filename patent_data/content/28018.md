# An improved phased array antenna system.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to an improved phased array antenna system comprising a plurality of reflectors 10, 12 , a feedhorn array 14 , and filtering means 18 capable of blocking the grating lobes associated with the beam launched by the feedhorn array. The filtering means is disposed at one of the focal points of the plurality of reflectors, such focal point being a real focal point F disposed between two subsequent reflectors of the system. The size of a central region of the filtering means is determined by the desired field of view at the far field, and may be adjusted so as to reduce the grating lobes to an admissible level with minimal gain degradation of the main beam.
