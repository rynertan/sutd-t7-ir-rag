# Polycrystalline silicon Schottky diode array and method of manufacturing.

## Abstract
A process and structure are disclosed which are suitable for forming large arrays of Schottky diodes at desired locations between mutually perpendicular strips of alumi num and strips of metal silicide. The invention is particularly useful in creating read only memories and programmable logic arrays, and allows fabrication of Schottky diodes more compactly than previous structures.
