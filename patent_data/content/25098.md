## Description
DESCRIPTION APPARATUS PROVIDING CONTINUOUS EXPANDABLE QUENCH SURFACE RlD CASTING METHOD BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to the substantial reduction of thermal distortion of a continuous casting quench surface. Specifically, this invention provides for radially unrestrained thermal growth of a hoop like quench surface of a quench wheel in the continuous casting of glassy alloy filaments Extruding a molten alloy from a pressurized crucible through a nozzle onto a rotating quench surface is one of several technologically significant methods available for the continuous casting of continuous glassy alloy filaments, as representatively shown inU.S.Patent 4,142,571 Continuous Casting Method forMetallic Strips issued March 6, 1979 to M. Narasimhan, hereby incorporated by reference. Typically, such filaments are continuously cast as thin strips, as required to achieve the extreme quench rates in quenching a molten alloy to the glassy state. To maintain transverse cross sectional constancy along the length of the strip as cast, it is essential that a geometrically stable quench surface be provided. In this regard, a substantial problem, referred to as crowning , has been encounteredr whereby thermal distortion of the hoop like quench surface of the quench wheel causes the quench surface to bow radially outward, since the hot quench surface is restrained along its periphery by the cool side disk of the quench wheel discontinuity stress . Thus, in steady state continuous casting with the quench wheel at thermal equilibrium, the bowing of the quench surface is undesirably induced in the transverse cross sectional shape of the cast filament. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention substantially eliminates the problem of quench surface crowning in quench wheel continuous casting by providing for the unrestrained radial thermal growth of the hoop like quench surface in a manner that also maintains concentricity of the quench surface with its shaft of rotation and further provides circumferential support against the torque loads of rotation so that the hot, expanded hoop like quench surface does not slip on its underlying rotative drive disk. The method of the invention for continuously casting metallic filaments, especially glassy alloy strips, includes the steps a directing a stream of molten alloy onto a hoop like quench surface of a rotating quench wheel and b allowing unrestrained radial thermal growth of the quench surface while maintaining its concentricity in a fixed angular relationship with the rotating quench. wheel. The apparatus of the invention for continuously casting metallic filaments by directing a stream of molten alloy onto a rotating quench surface, includes the elements a a quench wheel having a rotative drive disk, about a shaft of rotation, concentrically supporting a hoop like quench surface and b expansion means for allowing unrestrained radial thermal growth of the quench surface while maintaining its concentricity in a fixed angular relationship with the drive disk.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring specifically to the drawings, inFIG. 1, typical prior art apparatus for the continuous casting of a glassy alloy filament is illustrated to point out the general use of the present invention. The molten alloy is contained in a crucible 11 provided with a heating element 12. Pressurization of the crucible 11 with an inert gas causes a molten stream to be extruded through a nozzle 13 at the base of the crucible 11 onto a quench surface 14 of a rotating quench wheel 17. The solidified, moving filament 16, after its break away point from the quench surface 14, is typically routed through a tension regulator and finally onto a winder not shown . The quench wheel is provided with conventional cooling means not shown for maintaining the quench surface at a substantially constant temperature during continuous casting, by contacting the quench surface with a cooling liquid or gas. For example, cooling water may be circulated through the interior of the quench wheel, or the quench surface may be externally spray cooled. The quench surface is conventionally made of an alloy, such as beryllium copper, generally having most of the desired characteristics of high thermal conductivity, low thermal expansion, high abrasion resistance, and low chemical reactivity with and high wettability by the extruded melt. Additionally, the high conductivity quench surface may be thinly coated with a high melting ceramic or refractory alloy to improve wear resistance. Other components of the quench wheel may be of any conventional structural alloy, such as a high strength aluminum alloy. In FIG. 2, a partial cross section of the quench wheel 17 is shown to illustrate the problem of crowning or thermal bowing of the quench surface 14. Typically, the hoop like quench surface 14 is attached to rotative drive disk 15 of the quench wheel 17 by conventional rigid joining means, such as a bolt 21.The quench surface 14 at room temperature is desirably flat, but during operation a substantial temperature gradient is developed between the hot quench surface 14 and the cooler drive disk 15 as molten metal is extruded through nozzle 13 onto quench surface 14 to continuously cast filament 16. Thus, thermal expansion causes the quench surface 14 to crown or bow to the position indicated by dashed line 14A, since the lateral edge of the surface is restrained by the cooler drive disk 15 and bolt 21. As a result, the uniformity of the transverse cross section of the cast filament 16 is adversly affected. In FIG. 3, an embodiment of the present invention is applied to the conventional quench wheel 17 and comprises three radial expansion joints 31 connecting quench surface 14 and drive disk 15, instead of conventional rigid joining means 21. Disk 15A may be another drive disk or simply a coolant sealing disk. In concept, the radial expansion joints 31 allow unrestrained radial thermal growth of the quench surface 14 while maintaining concentricity of the quench surface 14 with the shaft of rotation 18 and while providing circumferential support against the torque loads of rotation so that the hot, expanded quench surface does not slip on the underlying drive disk 15 during rotation.In FIG. 3A, a detail of one such radial expansion joint is shown which in essence comprises a radially elongated expansion slot 32 in drive disk 15 having its major axis aligned along the radius of drive disk 15 cnd laterally receives a close fitting sliding pin 33.Sliding pin 33 is affixed to the underside of quench surface 14 and is slidably movable in slot 32 as quench surface 14 undergoes radial thermal expansion. On the other hand, sliding pin 33 is not free to move circumferentially in slot 32 and thus transmits torque loading from the drive disk 15 to the quench surface 14. At least three such radial expansion joints 31 are required to maintain concentricity of the hoop like quench surface 14 with the shaft of rotation 18 during radial thermal growth. Further, the radial expansion joints 31 must be symmetrically situated on the drive disk 15 to maintain concentricity of the quench surface 14. For example, the three joints 31 are spaced equiangularly 1200 intervals at equal radial distances from the shaft of rotation 18. Practically speaking, due to machining tolerances there will be some small circumferential slack in each radial expansion joint and therefore some correspondingly small circumferential rotational slack of the quench surface 14 with respect to the drive disk 15.This rotational slack may be minimized by increasing the number of radial expansion joints beyond the minimum of three that are funda mentally required to maintain concentricity of the quench surface. Based on statistical consideration of tolerances, it is preferred to use six radial expansion joints symmetrically situated as discussed above. In FIG. 4, a partial cross section of the quench wheel exposes the lateral details of one embodiment of the radial expansion joint 31. Sliding pin 33 passes through expansion slot 32 in drive disk 15 and is rigidly received into the underside 41 of quench surface 14. In FIG. 4A, an alternative arrangement of the sliding pin radial expansion joint is shown wherein the expansion slot 32 is integral tq the quench surface 14 and sliding pin 33 is rigidly received in drive disk 15. Other embodiments of the radial expansion joint are contemplated in addition to the sliding pin type. For example, in FIG. 5 a sliding key type of radial expansion joint is shown. Sliding key 51 is rigidly secured to the drive disk 15 and is received in expansion groove 52 under quench surface 14. Expansion groove 52 corresponds in shape to sliding key 51 such that a close fit is obtained. As discussed above, at least three such expansion joints, symmetrically situated, are required to maintain concentricity of the quench surface 14. As in the sliding pin joint, respective placement of the key and groove may be reversed. Drive disk 15 is shown optionally as supporting quench surface 14 near the center of its underside. Phantom disks 15A are sealing disks for an internal coolant.

Accordingly, such modifications and variations may be practiced within the scope of the following claims
