# Xerographic roll fuser.

## Abstract
Fuser rolls 31, 32 are moved into and out of engagement by means of a biassed linkage system 38, 37, 39 . This linkage system normally causes opening of the rolls. A cam follower arm is coupled to the linkage system by means of a solenoid. The rolls are closed only when the follower arm is following the high portion of a rotatable cam 33 and also the solenoid is energised.
