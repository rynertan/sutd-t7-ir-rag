# Multidrug resistance in mammalian cell lines and isolation of determinant glycoprotein DNA.

## Abstract
A method for isolating a cDNA specific for P glycoprotein is closed. Thee P glycoprotein is the determi nant in the muitidrug resistance phenotype exhibited by living cells. The nucleic acid equivalent of the cDNA may be cloned in a recombinant plasmid or phage. The cDNA may also be used as a probe in determining multidrug resistance in cells. The DNA molecules specific for the P glycoprotein is in the form of a gene family where various members of the gene family are amplified to varying degrees in multidrug resistant cells from various sources.
