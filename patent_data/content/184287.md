## Description
DESCRIPTION ,PYRI DYLAMINOETHENES This invention relates to new therapeutically useful pyridylaminoethene derivatives, to a process for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and to their use ss pharmaceuticals. The new pyridylaminoethene compounds are compounds of the general formula R1NNCH C ON 2 I wherein R1 representss 5 halogenopyrid 2 yl, preferably a 5 chloropyrid 2 yl, 5 iodopyrid 2 yl or, more especially, 5 bromopyrid 2 yl group . The compounds have valuable pharmacological properties, in particular properties which are indicative of utility in the treatment of arthritic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. For example, from tests in mice it was calculated that l 5 bromopyrid 2 ylamino 2,2 dicyanoethene, when twice administered orally, one hour before and four hours after the administration of antigen, each time at the doses shown in the followingTable I, would reduce by 502 the inhibition of migration of incubated mouse macrophage cells measured in a manner similar to that described by Likhite et al., Cellular Immunology, Vol. 5, 1972, page 377.This is a measure of antagonism or reduction of the levels of lymphokines and is indicative of utility In the treatment of arthritic patients.

These results are particularly Important because compounds currently employed in the treatment of arthritic disorders are primarily antiinflammatories and do not possess the said ability to inhibit joint deterioration. The beneficial properties of the compounds of formula I are enhanced by the fact that they have only very low mammalian toxicity. The compounds of formula I may be prepared by the application or adaptation of known methods. Thus as a feature of the present invention, the compounds of formula I are prepared by the reaction of compounds of the general formula R1 NH2 II wherein R1 is as hereinbefore defined with compounds of the general formula R20CH C CN 2 III wherein R2 represents an alkyl group of 1 to 5 carbon atoms, preferably with a straight chain, e.g.ethyl , generally at temperatures between 0t and 250 C, preferably at or near room temperature, optionally in the presence of an inert solvent.Suitable inert solvents include aromatic hydrocarbons, e g. toluene, aliphatic ethers, aliphatic nitriles, aliphatic amides, e.g. N,N dimethylacetamide, and, more especially, aliphatic alcohols, e.g. ethanol. Compounds of formula 111 may be prepared by the application or adaptation of known methods. By the term known methods as used in this specification is meant methods heretofore used or described in the literature. The following Examples illustrate the preparation of the compounds of the present invention. EXAMPLE 1 A mixture of 1r.amino 5 bromopyridine 3.5g , l ethoxy 2,2 dicyanoethene 2.5g and ethanol 50ml was left to stand at room temperature overnight. The resulting red solid was filtered off, washed with ethanol and recrystallised from ethanol, to give 1 5 bromopyrid 2 ylamino 2,2 dicyanoethene 3.8g , in the form of dark red crystals, m.p. 222 224OC. EXAMPLE 2 A mixture of 2 amino 5 bromopyridine 2.lg , l ethoxy 2,2 dicyanoethene l.5g and N,N dimethylacetamide 30ml was heated at reflux for 3.5 hours.It was then poured onto ice and the resulting solid was filtered off, dried, subjected to medium pressure chromatography on silica gel using a mixture of chloroform and ethyl acetate 4 1 v v as eluant, and recrystallised from ethanol, to give l 5 bromopyrid 2 ylamino 2,2 dicyanoethene O.35g in the form of an orange powder, m.p. 220 2210C. The present invention includes within its scope pharmaceutical compositions which comprise at least one compound of formula I in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or coating. In clinical practice the compositions of the present invention will normally be administered orally or rectally, or parenterally, for example topically or intraarticularly. Solid compositions for oral administration include compressed tablets, pills, dispersible powders, and granules. In such solid compositions one or more of the active compounds is mixed with at least one inert diluent such as calcium carbonate, potato starch, alginic acid, or lactose. The compositions may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g. lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate. Liquid compositions for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water and liquid paraffin. Besides inert diluents such compositions may also comprise adjuvants, such as wetting and suspending agents, and sweetening, flavouring, perfuming and preserving agents. The compositions according to the invention, for oral administration, also include capsules of absorbable material such as gelatin containing one or more of the active compounds with or without the addition of diluents or excipients. Solid compositions for rectal administration include suppositories formulated in manner known per se and containing one or more of the active compounds. Preparations according to the invention for parenteral administration i clude sterile aqueous or non aqueous solutions, suspensions, or emulsions.Examples of non aqueous solvents or suspending media are propylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying and dispersing agents. They may be sterilised, for example, by filtration through a bacteria retaining filter, by incorporation of sterilising agents in the compositions or by irradiation. They may also be manufactured in the form of sterile solid compositions, which can be dissolved in a sterile injectable medium immediately before use. As well as the more customary intrevenous and intramuscular routes, the compositions may be administered by intraarticular injection. Compositions in the form of solutions or suspensions, if desired together with additives as described above, in water or in vegetable or other greases, paraffin or other waxes, or lacquers or creams or lotions, to be applied topically, for example to the skin area around an affected joint to relieve arthritis, are also included in the invention. They may also include additives such as nicotinamide to assist absorption. The percentages of active ingredient in the compositions of the invention may be varied, it beg necessary that they should constitute a proportion such that a suitable dosage for the desired antiarthritic effect shall be obtained. Obviously several unit dosage forms may be administered at about the same time. Generally the compositions should contain 0.1 to 80Z by weight of active ingredientg especially when in tablet form. The dose employed depends upon the desired antiarthritic effect, the route of administration and the duration of the treatment. In the adult9 the doses are generally between 0.01 and l0Omg preferably orally between 0.1 and lOmg, or intramuscularly, intravenously or intraarticularly between 0.01 and lOmg of the compounds of formula I per kg body weight per day. The compounds of formula I may be administered each day or, according to the wishes of the medical practitioner, less often, e.g. weekly. The present invention provides a method of treating arthritic disorders in man which comprises sdministering to the patient an amount of a compound of formula I sufficient to combat an arthritic disorder. The following Composition Example illustrates pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention. COMPOSITION EXAMPLE 1 Capsules for oral administration were made up in the usual manner by filling No. 2 size gelatin capsules each with 155 mg of the following composition l 5 bromopyrid 2 ylamino 2,2 dicyanoethene 50 mg potato starch 100 mg magnesium stearate 2.5 mgAerosil 2.5 mg Similar compositions can be prepared by the use of any of the other compounds of formula I.
