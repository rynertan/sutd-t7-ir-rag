## Description
This invention relates to a transducible composite plasmid and more particularly to a composite plasmid capable of transduction having a Some species of the The vector systems heretofore known for host In This cosmid is characterized by its ability to be easily transmitted from a host strain to another strain by a transduction method using a phage. Herein, the term transduction method is defined as the insertion of a gene through the medium of a phage particle, as described in Protein Nucleic Acid Enzyme, extra issue, Experimental Methods for Microorganism and Phage Heredity, page 64 1972 . This method is based on the principle that when a cosmid retaining strain of bacteria is infected with an intact phage, for example, there is formed a pseudo phage particle containing cosmid DNA instead of natural intact phage DNA in a fixed proportion, and this particle acquires the ability to effect introduction of the cosmid DNA into a new host strain. When this cosmid is adopted, the desired transmission of genetic information is effected by simply preparing the phage bacteriolyzate of a donor bacterium and mixing this bacteriolyzate with a recipient bacterium, thereby causing infection. Thus, this method accomplishes the transmission of genetic information very rapidly and conveniently as compared to other methods using a plasmid. In none of the Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a vector capable of transduction when used with a This and other objects of the invention as will hereinafter become more readily apparent have been accomplished by providing a composite plasmid capable of transducing a A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereof will be readily obtained by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing, wherein The inventors have succeeded in producing a composite plasmid capable of transduction by the combination of a plasmid having a This composite plasmid can be inserted very simply and rapidly into the cell of a The The The plasmid which is propagatable within the cell of such a The phage which is capable of propagating within the cell of a The composite plasmid of the present invention may include the aforementioned plasmid DNA wholly as part of the composite plasmid, but it is minimally required to contain at least the genetic information for replication of the plasmid DNA. As regards the aforementioned phage, the composite plasmid of the present invention may contain the DNA of the phage wholly as part thereof, but it is minimally required to contain at least the DNA region of the phage which is necessary for incorporation of phage material into the particle of the forming phage when the The plasmid DNA and the phage DNA can be isolated from bacterial cells by any conventional method available for the purpose. Then the phage DNA and the plasmid DNA are separately fragmented using restriction enzymes. The desired plasmid capable of transduction can be obtained by using the fragments of phage DNA wholly in unfractionated form as the starting material. Additionally, as is widely known from the reported experiment on the cosmid of For the linkage of the phage DNA fragment so obtained and the fragmented or linearized plasmid DNA, the ordinary methods resorting to use of ligase can be adopted. Otherwise, this linkage may be attained by a procedure which comprises adding deoxyadenylic acid and deoxythymidylic acid or deoxyguanylic acid and deoxycytidylic acid respectively to the ends of the phage DNA fragment and the ends of the cleaved vector DNA by the use of a terminal transferase, mixing the resulting addition products, and annealing the mixture. The introduction of the product of linkage between the phage DNA and the plasmid DNA into a recipient bacterium belonging to the In the case of the protoplast method, ample high frequency can be obtained even by the aforementioned method using Selection of a strain retaining a recombinant plasmid capable of transduction is effected by the following method. Given strains are subjected to transformation and then allowed to form colonies on a suitable culture medium. The colonies are mixed. The mixture is subjected to bacteriolysis with a phage to prepare a phage solution. This phage solution is caused to infect a new host strain. Then the infected host is analyzed to screen out strains which have incorporated plasmids. When a gene controlling resistance to a chemical is present on such plasmids, this particular character can be selectively utilized. Thus, a strain retaining the desired plasmid can be easily obtained. Desired isolation of the plasmid DNA from the strain retaining the recombinant plasmid is accomplished by causing bacteriolysis of the cell, as by the lysozyme SDS treatment, treating the resulting bacteriolysis product with phenol, adding to the solution ethanol of a volume twice as large thereby inducing precipitation of DNA, and recovering the precipitated DNA. The invention now being generally described, the same will be better understood by reference to the following specific examples which are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not to be considered limiting of the invention unless otherwise specified. A phage F₁ used for the production of a composite plasmid was prepared by using The F₁ phage DNA was prepared by the following procedure. A strain of In a buffer solution containing about 5 µg of F₁ phage DNA, a restriction endonuclease Hind III was left standing at 37 C for 2 hours to effect perfect severance of the DNA chain. Part of the resulting reaction solution was heated at 70 C for 10 minutes and then suddenly cooled. The reaction solution so treated and the remainder of the reaction solution not treated were collectively subjected to electrophoresis in 0.8 agarose gel. As the result of this electrophoresis, it was found that the portion, about 2.1 kb, of the F₁ phage DNA fragment produced by the Hind III treatment was separated into two fragments, about 1.6 kb and about 0.5 kb, and that a cohesive end COS was present in the 2.1 kb fragment. This 2.1 kb fragment was extracted from the agarose gel and then refined, to afford about 0.4 µg of DNA. As a vector pAJ 43 deposited under the designation of AJ 11997, FERM P6857 molecular weight 3.4 megadaltons was used. From pAJ 655 Japanese Laid open Patent Application 58 I192900 , which has been deposited as From the strain resistant to chloramphenicol of high concentration as described above, pAJ 43 DNA was prepared as follows. First, this strain was inoculated to 1 liter of CMG liquid medium containing chloramphenicol in an amount of 10 µg ml and cultured at 30 C until the latter part of the logarithmic growth phase. The cells consequently produced were collected. The mass of cells was subjected to bacteriolysis with lysozyme and SDS by ordinary methods. The resulting bacteriolyzate was supercentrifuged at 30,000 x g for 30 minutes to produce a supernatant. The supernatant was combined with polyethylene glycol in an overall concentration of 10 to induce precipitation of DNA. The mixture was concentrated. The precipitate was dissolved in 10 ml of a Tris EDTA NaCl TEN buffer pH 8.0 . The DNA was treated with ribonuclease I used in a concentration of 50 µg ml at 37 C for 30 minutes. It was then extracted from phenol. The extracted DNA was left standing at 20 C to induce precipitation of DNA in ethanol of a volume twice as large. The precipitate was dissolved in 1 ml of Tris EDTA NaCl buffer. By subjecting this DNA solution to agarose gel electrophoresis voltage 5 V per 1 cm of gel for 15 hours , pure pAJ 43 plasmid DNA was obtained fractionally in an overall amount of 150 µg. The molecular weight of pAJ 43 was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. This agarose gel electrophoresis was carried out in a 0.8 gel under a fixed voltage of 5 V per cm of gel length for 15 hours in accordance with the method proposed by P. A. Sharp et al. Biochemistry, The DNA fragment so obtained with the restriction enzyme was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The results indicate that pAJ 43 was a miniplasmid containing an approximately 1 Md fragment containing the chloramphenicol resistant gene region of pBR 325 produced in vivo by deletion from pAJ 655 and an approximately 2.4 Md fragment containing a region essential for the maintenance of the replication of pAM 330. About 1 µg of the plasmid pAJ 43 obtained in 3 above was contacted with the restriction endonuclease Hind III at 37 C for two hours to effect perfect severance. The pAJ 43 fragment so produced was heated at 65 C for 10 minutes. The treated pAJ 43 fragment and 2.1 kb of the DNA fragment obtained in 2 above added thereto were caused to react with DNA ligase originating from T₄ phage at 10 C for 24 hours in the presence of ATP and dithiothreitol to effect linkage of the DNA chain. By adding ethanol of a volume twice as large to the resulting reaction mixture, the DNA linked by the reaction was precipitated and collected. The DNA so obtained was dissolved in a small amount of TEN buffer and used for the following transformation. The transformation was carried out by the protoplast transformation method. The After 10 days culture at 30 C, about 1,000 chloramphenicol resistant colonies were formed. All the colonies grown as described above 5 were scraped off and suspended in physiological salt water. Part of the suspension and about 10⁵ of F₁ phage were spread on one plate of CMG medium containing 2 of agar and 10 µg of chloramphenicol per ml and cultured at 30 C for one day. When the phenomenon of bacteriolysis by the F₁ phage was observed on the plate medium, 5 ml of physiological salt water was added to the plate medium to suspend the phage particles. The suspension was centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove residual cells and then passed through a bacterial filter pore size 0.22 µ to remove live cells. About 10⁹ cells of No transducing property was detected in the phage solution obtained from the strain retaining pAJ 43, but occurrence of a chloramphenicol resistant colony was observed in high frequency in the phage solution obtained from each of the aforementioned three strains. About 10³ chloramphenicol resistant colonies occurred when about 10⁹ of the strain of recipient bacterium AJ 12036 was infected with about 10⁷ phage particles obtained from AJ 12136, FERM BP 735 FERM P 7560 , one of the three strains. In the resistant colonies and the strain of AJ 12136, about 4.8 Md of plasmid was detected. This plasmid was clearly identified to be a cosmid consisting of pAJ 43 3.4 Md of vector and a DNA fragment 1.4 Md containing the COS region of F₁ phage and possessing the property of transduction. The cosmid found in the strain of AJ 12136 was designated as pAJ 667. The phage solution derived from AJ 12136 was used to effect introduction of pAJ 667 into the strain of Separately, a plasmid pAJ 668 capable of transduction could be similarly obtained by using pAJ 1844 Japanese Laid open Patent Application 58 192900 which has been deposited as With restriction endonuclease Bam HI, 5 µg of pUC4K product of Farmacia Gene, About 1 µg of the cosmid pAJ667 prepared by the procedure described in 3 of Example 1 was maintained with restriction endonuclease Bam HI at 37 C for two hours to effect complete cleavage. The cleaved cosmid was treated at 65 C for ten minutes and combined with 1.3 kb of the DNA fragment obtained in 1 above. The mixture was treated with a DNA ligase originating in the T₄ phage at 10 C for 24 hours in the presence of ATP and dithiothreitol to effect reunion of the DNA chain. The reunion reaction was terminated by addition to the reaction solution of ethanol of a volume twice as large. The DNA in the reaction mixture was precipitated and collected. The DNA so obtained was dissolved in a small amount of TEN buffer and subjected to transformation as described below. The DNA solution was transformed by the protoplast transformation method. The recipient, After six days culture at 30 C, about 30 kanamycin resistant colonies appeared on the culture medium. In one strain, AJ 12173, FERM BP 743 FERM P 7885, isolated from the colonies and cultured on CMG agar culture medium containing kanamycin in a concentration of 25 µg ml containing 10 g of peptone, 10 g of yeast extract, 5 g of glucose, 5 g of NaCl, and 20 g of agar per liter and adjusted to pH 7.2 , about 5.7 Md of plasmid was detected. The fact that this plasmid was formed from pAJ 667 vector 4.8 Md and 0.9 Md of a DNA fragment containing kanamycin resistant gene originating in pUC4K was confirmed by causing the plasmid to undergo reaction with the restriction endonuclease Bam HI at 37 C for two hours and comparing the mobility thereof with that of a molecular weight marker of known molecular weight, Hind III fragment of λ phage purchased from BRL . The plasmid detected from the strain AJ 12173 has been designated as pAJ670. The restriction enzyme map of pAJ670 is illustrated in the FIGURE. About 10⁸ cells of AJ 12173 retaining pAJ670 in the logarithmic growth phase and about 10⁵ of F₁ phage were spread on one CMG plate culture medium containing 2 of agar and 25 µg ml of kanamycin and cultured at 30 C for one day. As the phenomenon of bacteriolysis by the F₁ phage was recognized on the plate medium, 5 ml of physiological salt solution was added to the plate medium to suspend phage particles. The suspension was centrifuged at 1500 rpm for ten minutes to remove residual cells, and the residue of the centrifugation was passed through a filter for cell removal pore size 0.22 µ to remove live cells. About 10⁹ cells of The F₁ phage used in this embodiment of the invention was lysogenized in the AJ 12173 strain and was released into the culture medium either through spontaneous induction or through shaken culture in the liquid CMG culture medium containing 0.05 to 0.2 µg ml of mitomycin C. Phage particles are obtained easily in a high yield by causing the F₁ phage to infect a strain of The plasmid pAJ43 has been deposited as The invention now being described, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many changes and modifications can be made thereto without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as set forth herein.
