# Mechanical electrode.

## Abstract
A mechanical electrode 16 is disclosed for use in an electrical circuit in a cooking device, such as, an oven 10 . The mechanical electrode 16 includes a plurality of electric ally conductive needle elements 50 supported on a flat base plate 48 . Each needle 50 has a sharply pointed tip 52 for establishing current contact through an electrical field 56 with a food supplied with a voltage normally sufficient to generate corona current from the tip 52 to an aligned surface of the food for enhancing heat and mass transfer. A current limiting resistive material electrically connects each one of the needle elements 50 to the base plate 48 which, in turn, is electrically coupled to a constant current high voltage control 60 for regulating the voltage supplied to the food to complete the electrical circuit 34 . The current limiting resistive material forming a discrete path 73 of electrical resistance along each needle 50 so that any excessively high voltage concentration about any needle 50 is restricted through the resistive material and confined to individual needles 50 for suppressing arc formation. In this manner high voltage in the electrical field 56 is avoided, the voltage supply is protected from receiving any sudden high voltage surge and adjacent needle elements 50 are allowed to continue in corona current generating operation.
