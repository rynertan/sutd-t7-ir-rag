# SIGNAL PROCESSING APPARATUS FOR USE IN WELL BOREHOLE

## Abstract
In an acoustic bond logging tool, top and bottom transmitters 30, 36 are provided with a pair of spaced receivers 32, 34 therebetween. A multiplexer 50 including an output to a high speed analog to digital converter 52 is time multiplexed to digitize both receiver output signals obtained from the same transmitted pulse. By damping the transmitted pulse to provide first or second peaks in the transmitted burst and gating the receiver signals through multiplexing, the corresponding received peaks can be located and amplified. With a stepped digit gain control, the analog to digital converter 52 can be operated with greater resolution and improved accuracy whereby large, non clipped signal peaks are provided for digitization, thereby indicating attenuation of the transmitted signal, thereby indicating quality of the acoustic bond.
