# COMMUNICATION SWITCHING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A time division multiplexed switching system is dis closed with a transmit, and a receive bus. Communication ports are provided for transfer and conversion of signals between the lines and the buses. A control microprocessor is used for assigning appropriate time slots and for strobing the communication ports at appropriate times. The time slot interchange between the two buses is provided by a half frame delay network. The slots assigned to a particular interconnected pair of communication ports differ by a half frame period to provide full duplex operation.
