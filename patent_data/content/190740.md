# Use of substituted quinone electron transfer agents in analytical determinations.

## Abstract
Certain substituted benzo and naphthoquinone electron transfer agents are useful in analytical compositions, ele ments and methods, e.g. for determinations of living cells. These electron transfer agents are capable of being reduced by an analyte, and the reduced electron transfer agent, in turn, reduces another compound providing a detectable species eg. a dye . The reduction potential E
