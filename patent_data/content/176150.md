## Description
The present invention relates to a catalytic cracking process for heavy oil containing metallic contaminants, in more detail relates to a process for catalytic cracking a low grade heavy oil containing large amounts of metals such as vanadium, nickel, iron and the like in the presence of a mixture of chrystalline aluminosilicate containing cracking catalyst particles and alumina particles. The catalytic cracking process for hydrocarbon oil aiming at the production of gasoline has customarily been carried out by using a cracking catalyst which comprises dispersing a crystalline aluminosilicate in a matrix. This catalytic cracking process has obtained good results seemingly, so far as the hydrocarbon oil containing relatively small amounts of metal contaminants is used as feed oil, even though said feed oil is a heavy oil. However, petroleum conditions have recently get worse to bring about a critical situation that a low grade heavy oil containing large amounts of metals such as vanadium, nickel, iron and the like per se must be subjected to catalytic cracking. So far as said low grade heavy oil is treated, the usual catalytic cracking process as aforesaid does not necessarily achieve good results. That is, when the low grade heavy oil containing large amounts of metal contaminants is treated by using the usual crystalline aluminosilicate containing cracking catalyst, not only the cracking activity of the catalyst is harmed due to metal deposit but also contaminant increase for promoting dehydrogenation, whereby hydrogen and coke make increase and thus the yield of gasoline lowers. And, as the amounts of metals deposited on the catalyst increase, there is even a possibility that the crystalline aluminosilicate gives rise to crystal breaking and the cracking activity is further deteriorated. In view of this, as the measures for catalytic cracking of the heavy oil containing large amounts of metals there have usually been employed the process which comprises increasing the amount of cracking catalyst usage in order to lower the amounts of metals deposited on each catalyst particle or comprises mixing the used cracking catalyst whose amounts of metals deposited are relatively small and further the process which comprises adding an antimony compound to the feed oil in order to prevent the activity of the cracking catalyst from lowering due to metal deposit. However, these unusual processes are not necessarily praiseworthy because the operating cost is expensive. And, it is not preferable to increase the content of crystalline aluminosilicate in the catalyst for the purpose of increasing the cracking activity, because it leads to promotion of by production of coke and gaseous components and reduction of the gasoline yield. EP B 0 043 358 discloses a cracking catalyst having a good resistance of metal poisoning containing at least two particle fractions of different particle sizes, the cracking catalyzing zeolite material being concentrated to the coarser particle size fractions and the finer particle size fraction being formed for material having relatively lower or insigificant cracking catalyzing activity. The particles of the final particle size fractions have a matrix of kaoline and amorphous alumina silica and may contain for example an SO Example 3 describes a catalyst produces by mixing the finer particle size fractions containing 25 to 35 alumina with the coarser particle size fraction containing 25 to 30 weight percent of zeolite Y in the weight ratio of the finer fraction to the coarser fraction being 1 1. US patent 4 283 309 describes a hydrocarbon conversion catalyst suitable for conversion of heavy hydrocarbon oils containing large amounts of metallic contaminants to lower boiling products. The catalyst comprises a porous inorganic oxide such as bulk alumina composited with an inorganic oxide gel matrix such as silica alumina, and a crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite. The bulk alumina works as an absorbent substance. This bulk alumina is according to the US patent in the catalyst particles and not in the smaller particles. The present invention provides a process which is capable of catalytic cracking even a low grade heavy oil containing large amounts of metals, by using a novel measure different from those employed in the usual processes and while maintaining a high yield of gasoline. The new process is characterized by contacting the above mentioned heavy oil, under catalytic cracking conditions with a catalyst composition consisting of a physical admixture of A particles of a crystalline aluminosilicitate containing cracking catalyst and B a mixture of particles of alumina and particles of alumina containing phosphorous said alumina particles having an average particle diameter of from 20 to 80 µm and a bulk density of from 0,60 to 1,20 g ml, and in said particles of alumina containing phosphorus, the atomic ratio of P to Al being in the range of 0,01 1 to 0,14 l, the weight ratio to A B being in the range of 80 20 to 20 80, and said catalyst composition containing from 10 to 50 by weight of said crystalline aluminosilicitate. During a catalytic cracking process the metallic contaminants in this heavy oil are preferentially captured by said alumina particles, whereby the production of hydrogen and coke is reduced and the yield of gasoline is increased. Said catalyst composition contains preferably from 20 to 40 by weight of said crystalline aluminosilicate. Further, our inventors have found that when incorporating a phosphorus component in the alumina particle, the dehydrogenating activity of metals captured by the alumina particle is retarded, and consequently the coke make and the production of by product and dry gas are reduced. As the crystalline aluminosilicate containing cracking catalyst particles used in the present invention, there may be enumerated various hitherto used cracking catalyst particles which comprise dispersing crystalline aluminosilicates in the matrixes formed of porous inorganic oxides, and may be enumerated most commonly catalyst particles which comprise dispersing ammonium ion exchanged or rare earth exchanged faujasite in silica or silica alumina. In the case of the hitherto used catalyst, the amount of the crystalline aluminosilicate dispersed in the matrix is about 10 50wt , more commonly about 20 40 wt . In the case of the present invention which uses an alumina particle together with a cracking catalyst particle, it is preferable to adjust the amount of the crystalline alumino silicate in the cracking catalyst beforehand, taking the mixing ratio of both which will be referred to afterwards into consideration, so that the amount of the crystalline aluminosilicate may become 10 50 wt , preferably 20 40 wt , on the basis of the mixture of the cracking catalyst particle and the alumina particle irrespective of whether it contains a phosphorus component or not . The alumina particle used together with the cracking catalyst may be a commercially available active alumina usable as a fluid catalyst, but it is preferable that its average particle diameter and bulk density are in the same degree with those of the concurrently used cracking catalyst irrespective of whether it contains a phosphorus component or not . In this sense, it is proper that the alumina particle to be used in the present invention should have an average particle diameter in the range of 20 80 µm, preferably 40 70 µm, and a bulk density in range of 0.60 1.20 g ml. And, it is preferable that said alumina particle should have an oil absorption of at least 0.2 ml g. The alumina particle like this can be readily obtained, for instance, by the steps of preparing an alumina hydrate by virtue of the neutralization reaction between an aqueous sodium aluminate solution and an aqueous aluminum sulfate solution removing a by product salt from said hydrate by washing thereafter peptizating the alumina hydrate with an acid in case of necessity then spray drying same and thereafter calcining. And, the particle obtained by calcining the aluminum hydroxide having an average particle diameter 20 80 µ obtained by Bayer s process is also suitable as the alumina particle of the present invention, and this particle is profitable in that its production cost is cheap. On the occasion of incorporating the phosphorus component in the alumina particle, there is employable a process of impregnating the alumina particle with an aqueous solution of a phosphorus compound such as phosphoric acid, phosphate or the like. The amount of the phosphorus component contained in the alumina particle preferably should be regulated so that the atomic ratio of P A1 of a finally obtained phosphorus containing alumina particle may be in the range of 0.01 0.14. In case the P A1 atomic ratio of the phosphorus containing alumina particle is 0.01 or less, the effect of the phosphorus can not be displayed, while in case the P A1 atomic ratio is 0.14 or more, the pore volume of the phosphorus containing alumina decreases, the oil absorption lowers, and the bulk density becomes larger than that of the cracking catalyst. Therefore, both cases are not desirable. In the preparation of the phosphorus containing alumina particle, if the commercially available alumina particle is not used and the alumina particle per se must be prepared, it is applicable to impregnate the calcined alumina particle with the phosphorus component, but it is rather profitable to impregnate the alumina particle before calcination because only one calcination is enough. In the present invention, it is necessary that the mixing ratio of the cracking catalyst particle to the alumina particle should be in the range of 80 20 20 80 in terms of weight ratio, irrespective of whether the alumina particle contains a phosphorus component or not. When the amount of the alumina particle is less than this range, the metal contaminants in the feed oil can not be captured well preferentially by the alumina particle, and contrarily when the amount of the cracking catalyst is less than this range, as a matter of course the cracking activity lowers and thus catalytic cracking of the feed oil can not be effected sufficiently. Accordingly, in the practice or the process of the present invention it is preferable that when the amount of metal contaminants contained in the feed oil is considered to be large, the percentage of the alumina particle in the mixture of the cracking catalyst and the alumina particle should be increased and lowering of the cracking activity to be caused by the relative decrease of the amount of the cracking catalyst should be compensated by increasing the amount of the crystalline aluminasilicate dispersed in the cracking catalyst. Of course, the particulate mixture is composed of three kinds of particles, namely cracking catalyst particles, phosphorus component free alumina particles and phosphorus containing alumina particles. As the cracking conditions, there may be employed also in the present invention those which have hitherto been employed in the prior art. The typical cracking conditions like these can be enumerated as follows It is customary in the catalytic cracking process for hydrocarbon to regenerate the cracking catalyst deactivated by coke deposition by carbon burning, and reutilize it for cracking reaction. The process according to the present invention can also regenerate the used cracking catalyst and alumina particle by means of the usual regenerative appartuses and regenerative conditions, and reutilize them. This regeneration is normally carried out at 600 750 C. The catalytic cracking process of the present invention is effective when using the relatively high grade heavy oil, whose metal contaminant content is small, as the feed oil, but it is when catalytic cracking the low grade heavy oil whose metal contaminant content is high that the profitability of the present invention is most markedly displayed. The process of the present invention permits to obtain gasoline in high yield from the heavy oil whose total metal content is about 50 ppm in terms of metal . This point will be more detailed. As the alumina particle mingled with the cracking catalyst displays a strong affinity against metals such as vanadium, nickel and the like as compared with crystalline aluminosilicate, silica, silica alumina and the like constituting the cracking catalyst, the metals in the feed oil preferentially deposit on the alumina particle and react with alumina while exposed to a high temperature to be deactivated. Due to this, the dehydrogenation reaction caused by deposited metals is retarded, and consequently by production of coke, hydrogen and other gaseous components is retarded. The phosphorus component, in the alumina particles retards the dehydrogenation activity of metals, in particular the action of nickel whose dehydrogenation activity is especially high, so that by production of coke, hydrogen and other gaseous components can be retarded sharply as compared with the alumina particle free from said phosphorus component. Viewed from the side of cracking catalyst, whilst, since the phosphorus containing alumina particle coexists, deposition of metals on said catalyst widely decreases, and thus the catalytic activity inherent in the cracking catalyst can be maintained at a high level for a long period of time. A commercially available No. 3 water glass was diluted to obtain a water glass solution having a SiO₂ concentration of 12.73 wt . This water glass solution and a sulfuric acid concentration 25 were poured into the same vessel for 10 minutes at the rates of 20 l minute and 5.6 l minute respectively to thereby obtain a silica hydrosol. This silica hydrosol was mingled with kaolin in an amount of 30 based on the weight of the final composition, and was further mingled with a 30 wt aqueous slurry of a rear earth exchanged Y type zeolite exchange rate 67 so that the amount of zeolite might become 50 based on the weight of the final composition. This mixture was spray dried, thereafter washed and dried to obtain a cracking catalyst A. This catalyst was found to have an average particle diameter of 57 µm and a bulk density of 0.80 g ml. An aluminum hydroxide having an average particle diameter of 70 µm produced by Bayer s process was calcined at 550 C for 3 hours to obtain an alumina particle having a bulk density of 0.76 g ml and an oil absorption of 0.42 ml g. The above mentioned cracking catalysts and alumina particles were each sieved so as to remove 55 µm or more particles from the cracking particles and 55 µm or less particles from the alumina particles. Thereafter, the remainders were each treated at 770 C for 6 hours in 100 steam, and then calcined at 600 C for hour in the air. Thereafter, these cracking catalysts and alumina particles were mingled at a predetermined ratio. By using this particulate mixture, the following catalytic cracking reactions were carried out. A mixture comprising adding nickel naphthenate and vanadium naphthenate to a desulfurized vacuum gas oil DSVGO so that the nickel content and the vanadium content might each become 200 ppm was employed as a feed oil. This feed oil was subjected to 75 seconds catalytic cracking reaction by employing the reaction conditions reaction temperature 482 C, weight hourly space velocity 16 hr ¹, and particulate mixture feed oil weight ratio 3. Thereafter, the reaction regeneration operation comprising treating the particulate mixture within the reaction zone at 630 C for 50 minutes in the air for regeneration and then subjecting same again to the above catalytic cracking reaction was repeated 14 times. The catalytic cracking results obtained in the 15th reaction were valued, and further the amount of metal on the particulate mixture at the time when the 15th reaction had completed were measured. The obtained results are shown in Table 1. Catalytic cracking reactions were carried out according to the exactly same conditions and procedure as Example 1 except that the following catalysts were employed in place of the cracking catalyst used in Example 1. The results are shown in Table 2. Catalysts B, C and E were prepared according to the exactly same procedure as Catalyst A except that kaolin was added to the silica hydrosol so that the kaolin amount might become 52 , 33 and 25 respectively based on the weight of the final composition. And, catalyst D was prepared by adding the rare earth exchanged Y type zeolite alone exclusive of said kaolin to the silica hydrosol so that said zeolite amount might become 90 based on the weight of the final composition. When activity is compared in the manner of unifying the zeolite content in the mixture of the cracking catalyst and the alumina particle, it can be seen from Table 2 that the process of the present invention is little in the lowering of activity because the amount of metal deposit on the cracking catalyst is small. A catalytic cracking reaction was carried out according to the exactly same conditions and procedure as Example 1 except that the following silica particle, spent catalyst or silica alumina particle is employed in place of the alumina particle used in comparative Example 1. The results shown in Table 3 were obtained. The particle mixing ratio was fixed to be 50 50 in every case. An aqueous water glass solution having a SiO₂ concentration of 12.73 wt and a sulfuric acid having a concentration of 25 were mixed to prepare a silica hydrosol. This was spray dried, thereafter washed and dried, and then calcined at 550 C for 3 hours to thereby obtain silica particles having an average particle diameter of 70 µm and a bulk density of 0.71 g ml. These silica particles were sieved to remove 55 µm or less particles. The remainder was treated at 770 C for 6 hours in 100 steam, and then calcined at 600 C for 1 hour in the air. The obtained particles were put to experiment. A cracking catalyst used in a commercial plant average particle diameter 75 µm, Bulk density 0.81 g ml was calcined at 600 C for 1 hour, and then put to experiment. This spent catalyst was found to contain 235 ppm of nickel and 438 ppm of vanadium. A commercially available No. 3 water glass was diluted to obtain a water glass solution having a SiO₂ concentration of 11.2 . Separately, a 10.5 aluminum sulfate solution was prepared. This water glass solution and this aluminum sulfate solution were mingled at the rates of 20 l minute and 10 l minute respectively to prepare a gel. This gel was aged at 65 C for 3.5 hours and stabilized so as to have the pH of 5.8 by adding the water glass. This gel was spray dried at 220 C, thereafter washed, and dried to prepare silica alumina particles. These silica alumina particles were sieved to remove 55 µm or less particles. The remainder was treated at 770 C for 6 hours in 100 steam, and then calcined for 1 hour in the air. The obtained particles were put to experiment. Cracking catalysts as shown in Table 4 were prepared according to the same procedure as above The composition and bulk density of each catalyst are shown below. Each catalyst was found to have an average particle diameter of 57 µm. An aluminum hydroxide having an average particle diameter of 70 µm obtained by Bayer s process was calcined at 550 C for 3 hours to obtain an alumina particle having a bulk density of 0.76 g ml, an oil absorption of 0.42 ml g, and a specific surface area BET process of 175 m² g. Then, part of this alumina particle was divided into 3 parts, each being 102 g. One part absorbed 40 g of a H₃PO₄ aqueous solution having a concentration of 9.7 , another part absorbed 40 g of a H₃PO₄ aqueous solution having a concentration of 34 , and the remainder absorbed 40 g of a H₃PO₄ aqueous solution having a concentration of 64 respectively. Then, these parts were calcined at 550 C for 3 hours to obtain the following 3 kinds of phosphorus containing alumina particles. A particulate mixture put to a catalyst cracking reaction was handled as follows so that said mixture might be suitably divided into cracking catalysts and phosphorus containing alumina particles. That is, the above mentioned cracking catalysts and phosphorus containing alumina particles were each sieved so as to remove 55 µm or more particles from the cracking catalysts and 55 µm or less particles from the phosphorus containing alumina particles. Thereafter, the remainders were each treated at 770 C for 6 hours in 100 steam, and then calcined at 600 C for 1 hour in the air. Thereafter, one kind of the cracking catalysts and one kind of the phosphorus containing alumina particles were mingled at a predetermined ratio. By using 4 g of said particulate mixture, the following catalytic cracking reactions were carried out. A mixture comprising adding nickel naphthenate and vanadium naphthenate to a desulfurized vacuum gas oil DSVGO so that the nickel content and the vanadium content might each become 600 ppm was employed as a feed oil. This feed oil was subjected to 75 seconds catalytic cracking reaction by employing the reaction conditions reaction temperature 482 C, space velocity 16 hr ¹, and particulate mixture 1 feed oil weight ratio 3. Thereafter, the reaction regeneration operation comprising treating the particulate mixture within the reaction zone at 630 C for 50 minutes in the air for regeneration and then subjecting same again to the above catalytic cracking reaction, was repeated 14 times. The catalytic cracking results obtained in the 15th reaction were valued, and further the metal deposit amount in the particulate mixture at the time when the 15th reaction had completed was measured. The obtained results are shown in Table 6. The total amount of feed oil suppried up to completion of the 15th reaction was 20 g. For comparison s sake, furthermore, a catalytic cracking reaction was carried out according to the exactly same conditions and procedure as aforesaid except that the following silica particle, used cracking catalyst or alumina particle free from phosphorus was employed in place of the above mentioned phosphorus containing alumina particle. The results shown in Table 6 were obtained. An aqueous water glass solution having a SiO₂ concentration of 12.73 wt and a sulfuric acid having a concentration of 25 were mixed to prepare a silica hydrosol. This was spray dried, thereafter washed and dried, and then calcined at 550 C for 3 hours to obtain silica particles having an average particle diameter 70 µm and a bulk density of 0.71 g ml. These silica particles were sieved to remove 55 µm or less particles. The remainder were treated at 770 C for 6 hours in 100 steam, and thereafter calcined at 600 C for 2 hours in the air. The obtained particles were put to experiment. A cracking catalyst used in an actual device average particle diameter 75 µm, bulk density 0.81 g ml was calcined at 600 C for 1 hour, and then put to experiment. This used catalyst represented by SC in Table 3 was found to contain 235 ppm of nickel and 438 ppm of vanadium. The alumina particles used for the preparation of aforesaid phosphorus containing alumina particles were sieved as they stand without treating them with an aqueous phosphoric acid solution, thereby removing 55 µm or less particles. The remainder was treated at 770 C for 6 hours in 100 steam and thereafter calcined for 1 hour in the air. The obtained particles were put to experiment. When valuing the experimental results shown in Table 6, attention should be paid to that each experiment is substantially equal in respect of the total amount of deposit metal. That is, taking the case of Experiment No. 6 wherein the cracking catalyst and the phosphorus containing alumina particle are mixed in the weight ratio of 75 25, the amount of Ni and V deposited on the cracking catalyst are each calculated from the fact that the total amount of particles contacting with the total 20 g of feed oil is 4 g each experiment of the present Examples as follows 3 g 1230 10 ⁶ 3.69 mg and 3 g 2230 10 ⁶ 6.69 mg. In Experiment No. 6, accordingly, the total sum of nickel deposited is 11.89 mg and the total sum of vanadium deposited is 11.91 mg. These values well coincide with the Ni amount 4 g 2980 10 ⁶ 11.92 mg and V amount 4 g 2990 10 ⁶ 11.96 mg in Experiment No. 8 using the cracking catalyst alone. In Experiment No. 2 wherein the cracking catalyst and the phosphorus containing alumina particle are mingled in the weight ratio of 50 50, the total sum of nickel deposited and the total sum of vanadium deposited are likewise calculated as follows, and these values well coincide with those of Experiment No 8. This relationship is applicable to other experiments. When attention is paid to the experimental results shown in Table 6 taking this point into consideration, it can be seen that in Experiments 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 according to the present invention, Ni and V deposit little on the cracking catalyst, and these metals deposit preferentially on the phosphorus containing alumina. And, it can also be understood from the experimental results of Table 6 that the concurrent use of the phosphorus containing alumina particle does not exert any experimentally bad influence on the cracking reaction per se, and rather reduces the metal deposit amount to thereby enhance the conversion rate and the yield of gasoline and reduce the amounts of hydrogen and coke produced.
