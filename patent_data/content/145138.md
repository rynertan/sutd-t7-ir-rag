# Automatic travelling wire electroerosion machining system.

## Abstract
An automatic TW traveling wire electroerosion machining system for machining a plurality of workpieces 2 of different types required to acquire different contours includes a TW machine 15 having a wire setting unit 15k and located adjacent a predetermined path. A work dispens ing unit 9 successively dispenses the different workpieces 2 on to the path from a store 1 thereof located adjacent the path. This unit 9 and a work handling and transfer unit 8 operate under control commands from an NC unit 12 and, in conjunction with the TW machine 15 with the wire setting unit 15k to carry out a plurality of work processing operations sequentially. In each operation, each individual workpiece 2 selected from the store 1 is transferred as it is carried on a pallet 3 for loading on to and unloading from the TW machine 15 . The electrode setting unit 15k on the machine 15 acts both to form a start hole and thread a wire type electrode 15i through the formed hole in the workpiece 2 . The unloaded workpieces 2 are transferred to an inspection stage for classification into acceptable and unacceptable products.
