# Raster scan duplicator.

## Abstract
A duplicating system having a raster input scanner RIS or a raster output scanner ROS in which information is written onto or lead from a recording medium 132 by raster scanning a light beam thereacross. The reflected light is detected by, for example, a photomultiplier tube 133 . Medium 132 is pro vided with a calibration strip 143 which is scanned during an initial calibration phase when the output of the light detector is compared to a reference voltage 137 , and the difference is stored as a correction factor in a memory 110 . A closed loop is used so that the difference value will settle at a value such that the detector output will accurately match the reference value before the final difference value is stored. In one mode, the correction is applied to one dynode of the photomultiplier tube 133 , which varies the gain without varying the band width of the circuit. Alternatively, the correction factor may be used to control the intensity of the light beam. The difference voltage is analog, but is stored in a digital memory through the use of A to D and D to A converters 138, 141 .
