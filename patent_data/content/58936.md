# Premolded expandable polystyrene sheet and method of making pallet components therefrom.

## Abstract
A molded sheet 10 of expandable polystyrene ma terial has a generally rectangular shape and a plurality of spaced, parallel openings 14, 16 extending there through. The openings 14, 16 are arranged in spaced, parallel rows. In a preferred embodiment, a plurality of cavities 14, 16 are molded into the surface of the sheet 10 to minimize deformation during molding as the sheet cures. A stack of such sheets is placed in a single grid electric wire cutter having a plurality of spaced, parallel, hot wires, and the wires are simulta neously passed through the stack to cut each sheet 10 into plural elongated members 71 85 , the surface of each of the openings in any given row of openings being substantially bisected into two substantially semicylin drical portions by a respective one of the wires. The elongated members 71 85 thus obtained are adapted for use in protectively supporting and spacing a plurality of rolls of material such as cellophane in a multi layer stack for storage or shipping.
