# IMPROVED ROTARY ELASTIC TRANSMISSION MEANS

## Abstract
An improved elastic coupling for transmitting power from one shaft to another shaft comprising a driving shaft connected to hub member and a driven shaft connected to a rim member both of which are operably connected by a plurality of radially positioned two ended loop elastomeric belt springs each mounted on a pair of swing arms which are radially spaced apart from one another and one of which is pivotally mounted on said rim member and the other pivotally mounted said hub member, each of said swing arms having elastomeric belt spring support means at one end, at least one of said swing arm support means of each pair being eccentrically mounted on their respective rim member or hub member with respect to their swing arm pivot points and said pivot points being in fixed positions relative to the centerline of the driving and driven shafts.
