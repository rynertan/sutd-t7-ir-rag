## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF A LACTAM The invention relates to a process for the preparation of a lactam by reductive amination, with the aid of a hydrogenation catalyst, of an oxo lakanecarboxylic acid suitable for that purpose or an ester of such an acid. According to the United States patent specification 3,235,562, such a process can very well be performed in the gas phase. This patent specification strongly advises against performing this process in the liquid pahse in a solvent, because in that case a lower yield is obtained, maong other things, on account of undesired side reactions. It has now been found that the performance of this process in the liquid phase in the absence of a solvent produces a very good result, and that in applying this process a yield can be obtained which is even higher than the yield obtained according to the said United States patent specification when applying the process in the gas phase. The process according to the invention for preparation of a lactam by reductive amination, with the aid of a hydrogenation catalyst, of an oxo alkanecarboxylic acid suitable for that purpose or an ester of such an acid is characterized in that the reductive amination is performed in the liquid phase in the absence of a solvent. As starting product various oxo alkanecarboxylic acids or esters of these acids can be applied. The proces according to the invenion is particularly suitable for the reductive amination of oxoalkanecarboxylic acids or esters of these acids having, between the carbon atom of the carbonyl group and the carbon atom of the carboxyl group, 2 or 3 carbon atoms in the carbon chain such as, for instance, the acids 5 oxocaproic acid, 4 methyl 5 oxocaproic acid and laevulinic acid or the esters of said acids. Preference is given to applying, as starting product, an ester of said acids, because a yield can then be obtained higher than that obtained when applying the acid as such. The ester can be formed as known in the art from the relative acid and an alcohol. When using the ester, an alcohol corresponding with the ester group is obtained as side product. Various ester groups can be used such as, for instance, an alkyl, cycloalkyl or benzyl group. Preference is given to a lower alkyl group such as a methyl, ethyl and isopropyl group. The reaction according to the invention can be performed with hydrogenation catalysts known in the art, for instance catalysts containing a metal or compound of a metal form the 8th group or 1st subgroup of the periodic system of the elements according to Medeleev.The chosen quantity of catalyst may vary, for instance a quantity of 0.01 g to 20 g catalyst, calculated as metal, per 100 g starting compound. As more catalyst is used, a shorter reaction time will suffice to achieve the same result. Preference is given to using, per 100 g starting compound, 0.1 g to 10 g catalyst, calculated as metal. If so desired, a promotor can be used as well. The catalysts can be applied on a carrier material such as, for instance, activated carbon, graphite, siliconoxide, magnesimoxide and mixtures of two or more of these materials. Preference is given to using a plaadium, platinum or nickelcontaining hydrogenation catalyst. Particularly suitable are nickelcontaining hydrogenation catalysts. The process according to the invention can be performed at various temperatures, for instance a temperature of between 50 and 300 OC. Preference is given to applying a temperature of between 100 and 250 OC. The pressure is not critical, but must be chosen so as to make it possible for the relative reaction to take place in the liquid phase. The process according to the invention can be performed while applying hydrogen having a partial hydrogen pressure of, for instance, 1 150 bar. A partial hydrogen pressure higher than 150 bar can be applied as well, but this does not result in an advantage. In addition to hydrogen, mammonia or a primary amine must be present in the reaction mixutre for the formation of the lactam according to the invention. If a primary amine is applied, an N substituted lactam is obtained with a substituent corresponding with the primary amine applied. Any primary amine which can be present in the liquid phase under the reaction conditions can be applied. The quantity of ammonia or primary amine can be varied, for instance form 1 10 moles per mole starting product to be converted.A quantity of ammonia or primary amine larger than 10 moles per mole starting product to be converted can be applied as well, but in doing so no advantage is achieved. Preference is given to using 1 3 moles ammonia or primary amine per mole starting product to be converted. For the practical realization of the reductive amination according to the invention, the modes of realizing catalytic liquid phase reactions known per se are eligible, for instance the realization in a stirred reactor with catalyst suspended in the liquid pahse or the mode of realization in which liquid starting product is passed over a fixed catalyst bed. The lactams that can be prepared according to the invention are suitable for various uses, for instance in the preparation of plastics. The invention is further elucidated in the following examples.Example I A stirred autoclave having a capacity of 0.5 1, provided with a storage tank, is filled with 21 g ammonia and 6.2 g Raney nickel. The storage tank contains 100.4 g methylester of 5 oxocaproic acid. The mixture in the autoclave is heated to 110 CC. The oxo ester from the storage tank is subsequently added to the mixture in the autoclave and simultaneously hydrogen purity 99.9 is metered up to a total pressure of 50 bar. In consequence of the reaction that occurs the temperature rises in a short time to 173 C. This temperature is maintained for 30 minutes and by the addition of hydrogen the total pressure is kept at 50 bar for this period. After cooling, the contents of the autoclave are diluted with ethanol and analyzed by means of gas chromatography.From this analysis the conversion of the oxo ester and the yield of product formed 6 methylpiperidone 2 and 6 methyl 3,4 dihydropyridone 2 can be calculated. The conversion of the oxo ester is understood to mean the quantity of oxo ester converted, expressed as a percentage of the quantity of oxo ester added. The yield is understood to mean the quantity of the relative product that can theoretically be formed from the quantity of oxo ester converted, expressed as a percentage of the quantity of oxo ester converted. The conversion is 100 . The yield of 6 methylpiperidone 2 93.2 and 6 mtehyl 3,4 dihydropyridone 2 3.3 . Example II In the way described in example I, 100.6 g methylester of 5 oxocaproic acid is added, at 143 OC, to 19.g ammonia and 5.67 g platinum on carbon catalyst 5 7. by wt. Pt . Drying this addition the temperature rises to 202 C. This temperature is maintained for 60 minutes at a total pressure of 50 bar. The conversion is 99.5 and the yield of 6methylpiperidone 2 80.8 .Example III In the way described in example I, 100.4 g methylester of 5 oxocaproic acid is added, at 154 C, to 12 g ammonia and 5.75 g palladium on carbon catalyst 10 by wt. Pd . During this addition the temperature rises to 223 C. After this temperature has been maintained for 60 minutes at a total pressure of 50 bar, the conversion is 97.2 7. and the yield of 6 methylpiperidone 2 88 .Example IV In the way described in example I, 102.2 g methylester of 5 oxocaproic acid is added, at 150 OC, to 20 g ammonia and 5.08 g nickel on silica catalyst 60 by wt. Uni . During the addition the temperature rises to 222 C. After this temperature has been maintained for 30 minutes at a total pressure of 50 bar, the conversion is 98.3 , the yield of 6 methylpiperidone 2 94 and of 6 methyl 3,4 dihydropyridone 2 2.9 . Example V In the way described in example I, 100 g methylester of 4 methyl 5 oxocaproic acid is added, at 150 OC, to 19 g ammonia and 5.12 g nickel on silica catalyst 60 Xwt. Ni . Drying this addition the temperature rises to 207 C. After this temperature has been maintained for 30 minutes at a total pressure of 50 bar, the conversion is 98 x and the yield of 5,6 dimethylpiperidone 2 85 .
