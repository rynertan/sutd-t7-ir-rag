## Description
This invention relates to a pharmaceutical preparation of cephalosporin for rectal administration. More particularly, the present invention is concerned with a pharmaceutical preparation for rectal administration which comprises an oleaginous base and, incorporated therein, a third generation cephalosporin, an amino acid and an ether type nonionic surfactant. When hardly absorbable water soluble medicines such as insulin and cefazolin are used for the systemic therapy, the administration mode is limited to injection. Even in the case of compounds which can be absorbed by oral administration, such as cephalexin and ampicillin, administration thereof to patients suffering from dysphagia or infants and babies encounters difficulties, and, therefore, the absorbed amounts of the medicines are often insufficient. As the new administration mode capable of overcoming these difficulties, there has been proposed and examined a rectal administration method. However, if a medicinal compound alone is administered, no sufficient absorption can be attained, and it has been reported that only when a medicinal compound is administered in combination with a surfactant, especially an ether type nonionic surfactant, the absorbed amount of the medicinal compound is increased see, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid OpenSpecification No. 72316 1973 . This ether type nonionic surfactant, however, is defective in that it has a strong tissue damaging action and it cannot be directly put into practical use. have made researches with a view to developing a practical pharmaceutical preparation for rectal administration while eliminating the above defects of an ether type nonionic surfactant. As a result, I have found that when an amino acid is added to a mixture comprising a water soluble medicine, an ether type nonionic surfactant and an oleaginous base, the tissue damaging action of the ether type nonionic surfactant can be drastically moderated and the absorbability of the medicine can be increased. It has also been found that when Ã…a third generation cephalosporin which is excellent in antimicrobial activity is used as the water soluble medicine in the above preparation, there are obtained good results in the tissue damage test and the concentration in blood test. By the term third generation cephalosporin used herein is meant a cephalosporin having a resistance to a 0 lactamase and an antimicrobial activity to not only gram positive bacteria but also gramnegative bacteria.Accordingly, when the third generation cephalosporin is used in the above mentioned pharmaceutical preparation and the resulting pharmaceutical preparation is applied to patients suffering from diseases caused by gramnegative bacteria or resistant bacteria, which diseases can hardly be cured by known water soluble medicines, it is expected that good curative effects will be obtained while suppressing occurrence of side effects such as diarrhoea by the action of an amino acid incorporated in the pharmaceutical preparation. Moreover, it has been found that this pharmaceutical preparation shows satisfactory results in the test for remedy of infectious diseases. The present invention has been made, based on such novel findings. As the third generation cephalosporin hereinafter often referred to only as ncephalosporin to be used in the present invention, there may advantageously be employed those of the general formula I and water soluble non toxic salts thereof EMI3.1 wherein R1 stands for an aromatic ring substituted methyl group, an ot substuted, aromatic ring substituted methyl group, an d substituted, aromatic heterocycle substituted methyl group or a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, said aromatic ring and said aromatic heterocycle each being substituted or unsubstituted, R2 stands for a hydrogen atom or a methoxy group, R3 stands for a hydrogen atom, a substituted or unsubstituted heterocycle substituted thiomethyl group, an acetoxymethyl group, an amino carbonyloxymethyl group or a substituted or un substituted heterocycle substituted methyl group, and X stands for S or O. Specific examples of the third generation cephalosporin represented by the general formula I include compounds of the following formulae 11 to XIV CefuroximeEMI4.1 CefoperazoneEMI4.2 CefotaximeEMI4.3 MoxalactamEMI4.4 CeftizoximeEMI5.1 CefmenoximeEMI5.2 T 1902EMI5.3 MT 141EMI5.4 CefpiramideEMI6.1 AC 1370EMI6.2 CefutazidimeEMI6.3 CeftriaxoneEMI6.4 and CefolanideEMI7.1 As examples of the above mentioned water soluble nontoxic salt, there can be mentioned sodium salts, potassium salts and hydrochlorides of the foregoing compounds. The caphalosporin as the active ingredient may be incorporated in an amount of 2.5 to 50 by weight, preferably 5 to 40 by weight, based on the total weight of the pharmaceutical preparation. In the present invention, as the ether type nonionic surfactant, there can be mentioned at least one member selected from polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene alkylaryl ethers and polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene alkyl ethers.Other non ionic surfactants such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters and polyoxyethylene hardened castor oils are inferior to the ether type nonionic surfactant in the effect of improving the absorbability of the medicine, though they are advantageous in that the tissue damaging action is slightly weaker than that of the ether type nonionic surfactant.Accordingly, from the practical viewpoint, use of these other nonionic surfactants is not advantageous. As the polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, there can be mentioned, for example polyoxyethylene lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene oleyl ether, polyoxyethylene cetyl ether, polyoxyethylene stearyl ether and polyoxyethylene butyl ether. As the polyoxyethylene alkylaryl ethers, there can be mentioned, for example, polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether and polyoxyethylene octylphenyl ether. As the polyoxyethylenepolyoxypropylene alkyl ehters, there can be mentioned, for example, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene cetyl ether and polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene behenyl ether.In these ethers, it is preferred that the degree of polymerization of the polyoxyethylene or polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene be 5 to 20 and the carbon number of the alcohol moiety be 2 to 22, and it is especially preferred that the degree of polymerization of the polyoxyethylene or polyoxyethylenepolyoxypropylene be 5 to 15, the carbon number of the chain portion be 7 to 18 and the HLB value be 7 to 15. The ether type nonionic surfactant may be incorporated in an amount of 0.05 to 10 by weight, preferably 0.3 to 5 by weight, based on the total weight of the pharmaceutical preparation. As the amino acid, there can be mentioned neutral amino acids exclusive of glycine, basic amino acids and acidic amino acids. They may be used alone or in mixture. It has been found that glycine has no effect of weakening the tissuedamaging action of the ether type nonionic surfactant. A crude amino acid mixture obtained by the hydrolysis of a protein or peptide may also be used as the amino acid in the present invention. Specific examplese of the amino acid include alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamic acid, glutamine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophane, proline, hydroxyproline, alginine, lysine, histidine, methionine, cystine and cysteine. They may be employed alone or in mixture.Among these amino acids, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, asparagine, glutamine, methionine, alginine, lysine and histidine are especially preferred. They may be employed in a free form. But, the basic amino acids may be used in the form of a hydrochloride or sulfate, and the acidic amino acids may be used in the form of a water soluble non toxic salt such as a sodium salt or potassium salt. The effect of weakening of tissue damating action of the ether type nonionic surfactant by the amino acid is not changed according to the kind of the amino acid, that is, the effect is not changed whether the amino acid used is a neutral amino acid, a basic amino or an acidic amino acid. However, the basic amino acid is excellent in the effect of improving the absorbabilityof the water soluble medicine.The amino acid may be incorporated in an amount of 0.5 to 20 by weight, preferably 1 to 10 by weight, based on the total weight of the pharmaceutical preparation. As the oleaginous base to be used in the present invention, there may be employed any of bases customarily used for the production of ointments and suppositories. For example, there can be mentioned oils and fats such as peanut oil, coconut oil, olive oil, soybean oil, linseed oil, cotton seed oil, sesame oil, corn oil, rice bran oil, camellia oil, cacao butter, lard, wool fat and beef tallow these oils and fats modified by hydrogenation, acetylation or fractional extraction glycerol esters of fatty acids having 6 to 30 carbon atoms such as Miglyol and Witepsomanufactured and sold by Dynamit Nobel, W.Germany, S R manufactured and sold by Kanegafuchi Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., Japan and Panacet manufactured and sold by Nippon Oil Fats Co.,Ltd., Japan and esters of fatty acids having 6 to 30 carbon atoms with alcohols having 2 to 8 carbon atoms such as isopropyl myristate . These oils and fats may be used alone or in mixture. In general, as the pharmaceutical preparation for rectal administration, those which are solid at room temperature and are adapted to be molten at the body tenperature are conveniently used, and, therefore, a glycerol ester of a fatty acid having 10 to 30 carbon atoms, cacao butter or the like is especially preferred as the oleaginous base. The pharmaceutical preparation for rectal administration according to the present invention can be produced by blending an oleaginous base and an ether type nonionic surfactant, followed by melting to obtain a melt homogeneously dispersing an amino acid and a cephalosporin into the melt and subjecting the resulting dispersion to shaping or preparation according to the known method adopted for the production of ointments or suppositories. If necessary, additives such as stabilizers and antiseptics may be added. The pharmaceutical preparation for rectal administration of the present invention may be not only in the form of an anal suppository which is solid at room temperature and is adapted to be molten at the body temperature, but also in such a form as is of an ointment or enema which has been prepared by dispersing the cephalosporin, ether type nonionic surfactant and amino acid in a liquid oil or fat and can be administered by means of a soft capsule for rectal administration or an injector for rectal administration. The pharmaceutical preparation of the present invention may generally be administered in an amount of 500 mg to 10 g, preferably 1 to 5 g per day for adults in terms of amount of a cephalosporin as the active ingredient, although the dosage should be determined by skilled physicians taking into consideration the ages and weight of patients, kinds and severities of disorders and other factors. The present invention will now be described with reference to Experiments illustrating the absorbability, tissue4ksaging action and infeoted animal curing activity of the pharmaceutical preparation for rectal administration according to the present invention and Examples illustrating the process for the production of the pharmaceutical preparation for rectal administration. However, it should be noted that the present invention is by no means limited by these Experiments and Examples. Experiment 1 The following animal tests were conducted with Wister male rats body weight about 200 g in order to investigate a tissue damaging action caused by the administration of prepara tions of the present invention and comparative preparations. A preparation as shown in Table 1 was administered to the rectum of the rat in an amount of 30 mg of cephalosporin per kilogram of rat which rat had been subjected to fast for 24 hours. When the preparation was solid at room temperature, it was administered in the form of an anal suppository. On the other hand, when the preparation was either an ointment or liquid, it was administered by means of a small syringe. After administration of the preparation, the anus of the rat was sealed by an instant adhesive, Aron Alpha manufactured and sold by Toa Gosei Chemical Industry Company,Ltd., Japan so as to prevent the preparation from leaking. The rat was killed by venesection four hours after the administration. Immediately after killing the rat, the rectum of the rat was cut off and examined with the naked eye. The number of rats in which congestion and festering were observed in the rectum was counted and the incidence was calculated. The results obtained are shown in Table 1.
