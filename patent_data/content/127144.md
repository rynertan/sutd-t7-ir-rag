# Paper tape feed and drive mechanism.

## Abstract
A paper feed and drive mechanism for use in a high speed printer comprises a pair of arms 22 which may be selectively positioned in a first lowered position, or in a second raised position. When the arms are in the lowered position, a line of contact 17 is formed between a pressure roll 20 and a drive roll 18 and a narrow printing gap is formed between the platen 26 and the inked ribbon. Spring 44 bias the pressure roll 20 onto the drive roll 18 and clips 34 mounted on the arms 22 hold the arms in the lowered position against the bias. Allowing the arms 22 to raise to a second position in response to the spring bias creates a gap between the pres sure roll 20 and the drive roll 18 and a wide non printable gap betwen the platen 26 and the inked ribbon. Addition ally, a narrow tear bar slot 33 formed between a fixed saw tooth tear bar 32 and a backing plate 30 attached to the arms opens to form a wide space when the arms are raised. The wide space eliminates the necessity to thread the paper tape 12, 14 through the narrow tear bar slot 33 .
