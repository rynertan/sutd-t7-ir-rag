# Process for the preparation of optically active alpha arylalkanoic acids.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for the preparation of optically active alpha arylalkanoic acids, consisting in the rearrange ment of optically active alpha haloalkyl aryl ketals and in submitting to hydrolysis the thus obtained esters of alpha arylalkanoic acids. The rearrangement reaction is carried out under neutral or alightly alkaline conditions, in an aprotic dipolar diluent and in the presence of a protic substance having a high dielectric constant.
