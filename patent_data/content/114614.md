DETERMINATION OF STEROID HOP ONFCiMwRON IDES The present invention relates generally to the quantitative determination of steroid hormone glucuronides.More specifically, the invention provides a novel immunological assay procedure for quantifying specific steroid hormone glucuronides utilizing a tracer comprising a steroid hormone glucuronide covalently bound to an enzyme. Steroid hormones are hormones normally synthesized from cholesterol and secreted by the adrenal cortex, testes, ovaries, placenta, and corpus leuteum of organisms. By definition, the above mentioned steroid hormones are physiologically effective in trace amounts. See Introduction ToModern Biochemistry, Academic Press, New York, New York, t3rd Edition, 1971 , page 358, wherein the physiological effects of several vertebrate steroid hormones are set forth as inTable I. TAB1 I Physiological Effects Of Vertebrate Steroid Hormones Gland ProducingSteroid Hormone The Hormone EffectCorticosteroids Adrenal cortex Mineral Balance Na retention Metabolism GluconeogenesisProgesterone Ovary corpus leuteum Proliferation of uterine mucosa Csecretory phase Estradiol Ovary follicles Proliferation of the uterine mucosa estrus Testosterone Testes interstial Maintenance of the cellsl accessary glands of the genital tract and secondary sex characteristics Inactivation of steroid hormones is achieved by metabolism in the liver or excretion in urine. Karlson, supra, pp. 260, 361 363. It is known that in humans endogenous steroids are excreted in urine principally as water soluble conjugates.See, Kellie, The Radioimuunoassay of Steroid Conjugates , J. Steriod Biochem., 6, p. 277 Uq75lt Derivatives of the pregnane series Cprogesteronel are excreted almost exclusively as water soluble glucuronides tpregnznediol glucuronide , and the principal excretory form of estrogens are also glucuronides estradiol glucuronide, estriol glucuronide, and esterone glucuronide . Kellie, supra, p 277. The important physiological effects elicited by steroid hormones have prompted substantial research into methods for detection and quantification of these hormones and their glucuronide derivatives. See, Jeffcoate, Progress Toward The Wider Use Of Steroid Immunoassays , J. SteroidBiochem., 11, pp. 1051 1055 1979 . One of the most studied relationships between endogenous concentrations of steroid hormones and their physiological effects has been role of the so called female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone in the menstrual cycle. It is generally agreed that peak estrogen excretion occurs about the middle of the human female menstrual cycle, and that during the leuteal phase the pregnanediol metabolite of progesterone output rises and a second estrogen peak occurs. Brown, et al, The Urinary Excretion of Oestrogens,Pregnanediol and Gonadotropins During The Menstrual Cycle ,J, Endocrin., 17, p. 401 1958 . A recent studv suaaests the determination of estradiol glucuronide levels may provide a useful indicator for the day of ovulation in humans and increased preganediol glucuronide levels may provide evidence of ovulation.See, Stanczyk, et al, Direct Radioimmunoassay for Urinary Estrogen and Pregnanediol GlucuronidesDuring The Menstrual Cycle , American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 137, pt 443 U9801, Treatment of infertility in humans has also been facilitated where urinary and plasma estradiol levels and serum progesterone levels were monitored.See, Black, et awl., An Assessment Of Urinary And Plasma Steroid Estimations for Monitoring Treatment of Anovulation with Gonodotropins , J. Obstet. Gynec. British Commonwealth, 81, page 667 1974 . Various assay methods have previously been employed to quantify steroid hormones in serum and steroid hormone glucuronides in urine samples. Although studies have been conducted using higher vertebrates See, Seeger, et al, An Enzyme Immunoassay EIA for Pregesterone in Horse Plasma ,J. Immun. Methods, 28, page 211 1979 , most assays have been directed to quantifying human steroid hormones or their glucuronide derivatives. Steroid hormones may occur in human body fluids in concentrations ranging from picomoles per liter serum estradiol, early leuteal phase of menstrual cycle , to as much as 100 micromoles per liter urinary estriol at end of pregnancy . See, van Weeman, et al, Enzyme Immunoassay of Steroids Possibilities and Pitfalls , J. Steroid Biochem., 11, page 147 1979 .Although less sensitive bioassays or chemical assays may be utilized to measure steroid hormones present in high concentrations, such assays lack the necessary sensitivity for many applications. The development of radioimmunoassay techniques has provided assays with sensitivities in the picomole per liter range. Typical radioimmunoassays involve addition of a fixed amount of radiolabelled steroid hormone to the steroidcontaining sample, followed by the addition of a fixed amount of steroid antibodies, and subsequent measurement of the radioactivity of antibody bound or unbound radiolabeled steroid hormone. See, van Weeman, supra, page 147. Radioimmunoassay of serum steriod hormones require repeated venipuncture of the subject. In addition to patient reluctance to venipuncture Csee, Seaton, et al, Use of SalivaryProgesterone Assays to Monitor Menstrual Cycles in BangladeshiWomen , CZin. Chem., 789 1033 1979 1, trained medical personnel are generally required to take the blood samples, Radioimmunoassays directed at determination of urinary steroid hormone concentrations have also been developed.See, Kellie, supra, pp. 277 281 Stanczyk, et al, DirectRadioimmunoassay of Urinary Estrogen and Pregnanediol Glucuronides During the Menstrual Cycle , Amt J, Obatet. Gynecol, 137, pp. 443 450 1980 . Steroid hormone glucuronides determined directly without hydrolysis of glucuronide derivatives into free steroid hormone include estrone glucuronide, estradiol 3 glucuronide, estradiol l7ss glucuronidew estriol 3 glucuronide, estriol 16a glucuronide, and pregnanediol 3a glucuronide. Stanczyk, et al, supra, pp. 443 444.Determination of steroid hormone glucuronides by radioimmunoassay of urine samples negates the need for blood sampling. Significant problems are associated with the use of radiolabeled compounds, include the need for specially equipped laboratories, specially trained personnel, expensive radioactive counting equipment, the short half life of some isotopes, waste disposal problems, and possible licensing problems depending on lacal legislation. See, van Weeman, supra, page 147. In addition, significant time is required to complete radioimmunoassays. A recently reported rapid radioimmunoassay of steroid hormone glucuronides required 2 1 2 hours of incubation time prior to the radioactive counting procedure. See, Chatteron, et al, Radioimmunoassay of Pregnanediol Concentrations In Early Morning Urine SpecimensFor Assessment Of Leuteal Function In Women , Fertility andSterility, 37, pp. 361 363 1982 .Other rapid assays require treatment of the urine sample with hot acid to hydrolyze the steroid hormone glucuronides into free steroid hormones before performing the actual quantification step. See, Metcalf, Rapid Gas Chromatographic Assay For Progesterone MetabolitesIn Urine , CZin. Biochem., 6, pp. 307 308 1973 . The use of nonisotopic steroid hormone immunoassays has been proposed to avoid many of the problems inherent in radioimmunoassays. Nonisotopic assays for steroid hormones include labeled ligand assays wherein determination of the steroid hormone consists of measuring the biological or chemical activity of fluorophores, bacteriophages, coenzymes, or enzymes.See, van Weeman, supra, page 147. Assays utilizing the latter approach commonly referred to as enzyme immunoassays or enzyme linked immunoassays, have been reported for the following steroid hormones estrogens, progesterone, testosterone and cortisol. Recently developed enzyme immunoassays for steroid hormones exhibit sensitivities equal or nearly equal to those of radioimmunoassays. See, Numazawa, et al., Picogram OrderEnzyme Immunoassay of Oestradiol , FERS Letter, 79, pp, 396397, 1977 . Bosch, et al, Enzyme Immunoassay for TotalOestragens in Pregnancy Plasma or Serum , CZin, Chimp Acta., 89, pp. 59, 63 1978 . Chatterton, Jr Robert T., Radioimmunoassay Of Pregnanediol Concentrations In marly MorningUrine Specimens For Assessment of Leuteal Function In Women ,Fertility and Sterility, 37, 3 361 366, to9821. These assays are generally referred to as heterogeneous enzymeimmunoassays in that the antibody hound enzyme labelled steroid hormone and unbound enzyme labelled steroid hormone are both enzymatically active and must be separated before measurements are madev A common enzyme immunoassay comprises combining enzyme labelled steroid hormone with the steroid hormone containing sample, incubating the mixture with antisteroid hormone antibody, and measuring the enzymatic activity of the antibody bound or unbound enzyme labelled steroid hormone after separation. Enzyme labelled steroid hormone and steroid hormone compete with each other for the available antibody binding sites.The amount of steroid hormone present in the sample is therefore related to the amount of enzyme labelled steroid hormone bound to the antibody. See, van Weeman, supra, page 147. Enzymes conjugated to steroid hormones and utilized in enzyme immunoassays include horseradish peroxidase, B D galactosidase, glucoamylase, alkaline phosphatase, glucose 6 phosphatase, and malate dehydrogenase. See van Weeman, supra, page 148,1 Although avoiding many of the problems associated with radioimmunoassay techniques, the reported steroid hormone enzyme immunoassays all use serum samples blood or pregnancy plasma as their steroid hormone containing sample. The problems inherent in obtaining multiple samples of blood or pregnancy plasma include the need for trained medical personnel and the possible subject resistance mentioned above. There has been little if any progress made towards developing an enzymeimmunoassay to determine urinary steroid hormone glucuronides. This may be due in part to the lack of suitable enzyme labeled steroid hormone glucuronide preparations.Certain enzyme labeled steroid hormone glucuronides such as horseradish peroxidase labeled glucuronides are generally stored in a liquid form, reducing their shelf life and increasing problems of contamination. Other enzymes show marked decreases in their enzymatic activity when covalently bound to the steroid hormone glucuronide see, Rjaowski, et al, The Efficiency of Different Coupling Procedures For TheLinkage of Oestriol 16a Glucuronide, Oestrone 3 Glucuronide and Pregnanediol 3a Glucuronide to Four Different Enzymes, J. Steroid Biochemistry, 14, pages 861, 863 865 1981 or when strong noncovalent associations are used to link enzymes to other hormones. See, Guesdon, et al, The Use Of AvidinBiotin Interaction in Immunoenzymatic Techniques, J. Bistochem.Cytochem., 22, page 1131 1979 . There exists, therefore, a long standing need in the art for an enzyme immunoassay to determine steroid hormone glucuronides.Summary Of The Invention The present invention provides a novel method for rapid, highly sensitive quantitative detection of selected steroid hormone glucuronides in a sample. The present invention relates to a method for determining steroid hormone glucuronides in a sample, said method comprising treating the sample with a known amount of a tracer comprising the specific steroid hormone glucuronide to be determined covalently attached to an enzyme treating the sample and tracer with a known amount of antisteriod hormone antibody to produce an assay mixture comprising antibody bound steroid hormone glucuronide, antibody, bound tracer, unbound steroid hormone glucuronide and unbound tracer separating the unbound tracer or antibody bound tracer from the assay mixture and determining the amount of the separated antibody bound tracer or unbound tracer present as a measure of the steroid hormone glucuronide present in the sample. Detailed Description Of The Invention According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the amount of steroid hormone glucuronide in a urine sample is determined by 1 combining the sample with a known amount of a tracer comprising a ligand corresponding to the steroid hormone glucuronide to be determined covalently bound to alkaline phosphatase 2 prior to, or simultaneously with the addition of the tracer to the sample, treating the sample with a suitable surfactant 3 adding to the sample and tracer a known amount of antisteroid hormone glucuronide antibody to form an assay mixture comprising antibody bound steroid hormone glucuronide, antibody bound tracer, unbound steroid hormone glucuronide, and unbound tracer and 4 determining the enzymatic activity of unbound tracer by precipitating antibody bound steroid hormone glucuronide and antibody bound tracer in the assay mixture and adding a known amount of the supernate comprising unbound tracer and unbound steroid hormone glucuronide to a solution containing an alkaline phosphatase substrate. The amounts of tracer and antisteroid hormone glucuronide antibody utilized in the method of the present invention are readily ascertained by one of ordinary skill in the art. The amount of tracer must be equal to or greater than the amount of antisteroid hormone glucuronide antibody.It is preferred that the amount of tracer employed be in excess to the amount of antisteroid hormone glucuronide antibody. Preferred methods of the present invention utilize a tracer comprising pregnanediol glucuronide, estradiol glucuronide, estriol glucuronide, or estrone glucuronide covalently attached to alkaline phosphatase enzyme. The present invention also comprehends methods of quantitative determination of steroid hormone glucuronides wherein enzymes other than alkaline phosphatase are covalently bound to said steroid hormone glucuronides. Another preferred embodiment of the present invention involves the determination of pregnanediol glucuronide. Pregnanediol glucuronide is a product of the enzymatic coupling of pregnanediol, a metabolite of.pregesterone, and glucuronic acid. Pregnanediol glucuronide is promptly excreted in the urine and, thus, provides a mechanism for estimating the concentration of progesterone in serum without venipuncture. Pregnanediol glucuronide, whether enzyme linked or not, will bind to pregnanediol glucuronide specific antiserum. Therefore, the concentration of either the unlabeled or enzyme labeled pregnanediol glucuronide in solution will determine the relative amount of binding to antibody. When pregnanediol glucuronide unknown from a urine specimen or a standard solution is equilibrated with a tracer comprising enzyme labeled pregnanediol glucuronide and antipregnanediol glucuronide antibody, the amount of tracer bound to the antipregnanediol glucuronide antibody will be related to the amount of unknown present in the urine specimen or standard solution. Upon separation from the antibody bound to tracer from unbound tracer measuring the unbound tracer the concentration of pregnanediol glucuronide in the sample or standard may be determined. The amount of pregnanediol glucuronide unknown in the sample or standard is related to the amount of unbound tracer in the supernatant after separation from the antibody complex. The methods of the present invention are effective in determining pregnanediol glucuronide concentrations in a range normally observed in urine, i.e., 1 40 micromoles per liter. In addition, the method of the present invention may be performed in less than one hour. To increase the sensitivity of the methods of the present invention, it is preferred to add to the sample prior to the addition of the anti steroid hormone glucuronide antibody, a surfactant capable of maximizing the amount of free steroid hormone glucuronide in the sample. Suitable surfactants include for example, alkyl polyether sulfates, i.e., Triton S 301, Triton X 151, Triton X 100 , sodium alkyl sulfates i.e., sodium dodecyl sulfate , quaternary amines and ammonium salts i.e., dodecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide , cholestrol like acids i.e., deoxycholic acid , dioctyl sodium sulfonate TritonGR 7M , and the like. It is preferred to employ a polyaryl sulfate as the surfactant in the methods of the present invention. It is most preferred to employ Triton X 301 as the surfactant. As previously mentioned, the enzymatic activity of either the antibody bound tracer or unbound tracer may be determined as a measure of the steroid hormone glucuronide in the sample. Prior to the determination of the enzymatic activity, the antibody bound tracer or unbound tracer to be determined must be separated from the assay mixture. Methods for separating the antibody bound tracer or unbound tracer are readily ascertained by one of ordinary skill in the art and include for example, immunoprecipitation of antibody bound components of the assay solution, solid phase separation, and the like.It is preferred to employ an antibody specific for the anti steroid hormone glucuronide antibody to precipitate antibody bound tracer and antibody bound steroid hormone glucuronide in the assay mixture and then determine the enzymatic activity of the unbound tracer in the remaining assay mixture supernate. The enzymatic activity of the separated antibody bound tracer or unbound tracer is determined utilizing conventional techniques, such as for example, colorimetric determinations employing a substrate specific for the enzyme label. The determination of the concentration of steroid hormone glucuronide present in the sample may be achieved by comparison of the enzymatic activity of the assay mixture supernate to a standard curve prepared utilizing an assay system employing known quantities of tracer, steroid hormone glucuronide, antisteroid hormone antibody, and alkaline phosphatase substrate. The following examples will serve to further illustrate the present invention and are not intended to limit it in spirit or in scope.

Pregnanediol glucuronide tracer solution comprising pregnanediol glucuronide covalently attached to alkaline phosphatase enzyme, prepared according to the procedures described in Example IV or V, and suspended in carbonate buffer with protein, 1 lactose and 0.1 sodium azide standard solutions of pregnanediol glucuronide, 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 uM, were compiled by mixing appropriate amounts of the purified glucuronide with charcoal stripped male urine containing 0.1 sodium azide DAPS DoubleAntibody Precipitin Suspension comprised of normal goat serum porcine antiboat antiserum was prepared according to Morgan and Lazarow, Diabetes 12 115 126, 1963 Abbott A GentAlkaline Phosphatase Reagent a quenching solution comprising 10 mMcystiene and an unassayed urine control. All of the above reagents may be provided in dry form and broucht up to the desired volume with water immediately prior to performing the test procedures Urine can be collected with normal home or office collection. Although steroids are stable in urine for periods of two to three days, the test procedure should preferably be performed as promptly as possible after collection. The following example illustrates the test procedure for quantification of pregnanediol glucuronide in a urine sample, EXAMPLE II The reagents of Example I are employed in the following sequence of steps Twenty five microliters C25 L of urine sample, standard solution or urine control are added to duplicate sets of culture tubes, A blank culture tube is also established by adding 25 r of water to a separate culture tube. One hundred microliters t100 .sl of the preganediol glucuronide tracer solution is added to each culture tube except the blank tube, to which 100 l of water is added.Fixed amounts of pregnanediol glucuronide antibody solution 100 vQ are added to all the culture tubes including the blank , and each tube is vortexed to mix the samples thoroughly, After mixing, the tubes are covered and incubated at 370 C for ten minutes, whereupon 20.0 l ofDAPS is added to each culture tube, All samples are again vortexed mixed thoroughly and incubated at 370 C for ten minutes.After incubation, all tubes are centrifuged at 1000 X g for ten minutes, One hundred microliter 100 UOO Rr aliquots are removed from the supernate in each tube and carefully pipetted into labeled reaction tubes so as not bbrdisturb the pellet in the bottom of each tube. To each reaction tube is added 100 u of Abbott A Gent Alkaline Phosphatase Reagent, and the samples are mixed thoroughly and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. After the room temperature incubation, 1.5 ml of quenching solution is added to each reaction tube and the absorbance of the samples are then read on a spectrophotometer at an appropriate wavelength for p nitrophenol and compared to a standard curve prepared using a standard solution of pregnanediol glucuronide. EXAMPLE III Another embodiment of the method of the present invention utilizes an immune precipitant comprising a suspension of rabbit anti pregnanediol glucuronide antibody and goat anti rabbit antibody Cimmune DAPS . This suspension is prepared in accordance with a method analogous to the procedure employed to prepare the goat anti rabbit normal rabbitIgG CDAPS suspension in Example I, except the binding of the alkaline phosphatase labeled pregnanediol glucuronide tracer is determined at various antibody dilutions.The antipregnanediol glucuronide precipitin is employed in the methods of the present invention in accordance with the following procedure Twenty five microliters t25 pt1 of urine sample, standard solution or urine control are added to duplicate sets of culture tubes. A blank culture tube is also estahlished by adding 25 pt of water to a separate culture tube, One hundred microliters 100 pQ of an antipregnanediol glucuronide immuneDAPS precipitin suspension is added to each culture tube, including the blank, and each tube is vortexed to mix the samples thoroughly. After mixing, the tubes are covered and incubated at 370 C for ten minutes. After incubation, all tubes are centrifuged at 1000 X g for ten minutes, One hundred microliter 100 pt aliquots are removed from the supernate m each tube and carefully pipetted into labeled reaction tubes so as to not disturb the pellet in the bottom of each tube,To each reaction tube is added 100 pg of A Gent Alkaline Phosphatase Reagent, and the samples are mixed thoroughly and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. After the room temperature incubation, 1.5 ml of quenching solution is added to each reaction tube and the samples mixed thoroughly.The absorbance of the sanples are then read on a spctrheeeter at an appropriate wavelength for p nitropnsnol and then compared to a standard curve using standard solution of pregnanediol glucuronide. Tracers employed in the methods of the present invention may be prepared in accordance with the following procedure an N hydroxysuccinimide ester of pregnanediol glucuronide is prepared by mixing pregnanediol glucuronide with N hydroxysuccinimide in the presence of 1 ethyl 3 3dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride in dimethyl formamide. The pregnanediol glucuronide ester thus prepared is reacted with alkaline phosphatase in an appropriate buffer at molar ratios of glucuronide to alkaline phosphatase in the range of from about 500 1 to about 100 1, preferably from 200 1 to 100 1. The alkaline phosphatase labeled pregnanediol glucuronide produce is purified by gel chromatography or dialysis.Other alkaline phosphatase labeled gluruconides may be prepared by utilizing other glucuronides such as for example, estradiol, glucuronide, estriol glucuronide or esterone glucuronide, in lieu of pregnanediol glucuronide in the above described procedure. The following Examples serve to further illustrate the preparation of specific tracers useful in the methods of the present invention. EXAMPLE IV A mixture comprising pregnanediol glucuronide 100 mg, 200 umol , N hydroxysuccinimide 30 mg, 260 mol , l hydroxybenztriazole hydrate 0.1 mg, 0.75 umol , andN,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide 57 mug, .276 umol was stirred in 1 ml of dry dimethylformamide for one hour at 5 C, allowed to stand at room temperature for 18 hours, filtered and the filtrate evaporated under reduced pressure to yield a residue. The residue was dissolved in dry acetone, precipitated with ether, and the precipitate collected on a filter and dried to yield a pregnanediol glucuronide active ester as a white powder. 3.2 mg of the pregnanediol glucuronide active ester was dissolved in 200 1 of dry dimethyl formamide.Portions of the resulting solution in molar ratios of 120 1, 145it, and 165 1 of active ester to alkaline phosphatase were mixed with 50 pQ of purified alkaline phosphatase and shaken for 18 hours at 40 C to yield a crude product. The crude product was purified over gel filtration minicolumns to yield an alkaline phosphatase labeled pregnanediol glucuronide tracer. EXAMPLE V Pregnanediol glucuronide 25.0 mg, 50 iimol , N hydroxysuccinimide 8.5 mg, 74 umol , and l ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride 815 mg, 45 umol were stirred in 1 ml of dry dimethyl formamide for 24 hours to yield a solution containing a pregnanediol glucuronide active ester. A portion of the solution having a molar ratio of 490 1 of pregnanediol glucuronide active ester to alkaline phosphatase was reacted with 400 u of purified alkaline phosphatase to yield a crude product which was purified over 25 minicolumns and dialyzed against buffer containing 0.1M sodium phosphate, 0.1 mM MgC12 and 0.1 deoxycholic acid pH 7.0 2 X 500 ml to yield an alkaline phosphatase labeled pregnanediol glucuronide tracer.

The estradiol glucuronide active ester was reacted in situ with 40 vQ of purified alkaline phosphatase in molar ratios of 60 1, 120 1, 180 1, 240 1, 300 1, and 360 1 of active ester to alkaline phosphatase to yield a crude product. The crude product was purified over minicolumns to yield an alkaline phosphatase labeled estradiol glucuronide tracer.
