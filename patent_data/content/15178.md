# Drum brake assembly.

## Abstract
In a drum brake assembly a hydraulic actuator 16 is engageable with a pair of brake shoes 12, 14 to move the same into engagement with a rotatable member. A parking lever 26 also cooperates with the pair of brake shoes 12, 14 to move the same into engagement with the rotatable member and an anchor plate 34 forms a connecting member between the pair of brake shoes. A backing plate 10 supports the pair of brake shoes 12, 14 and the anchor plate 34 . The anchor plate 34 is movably supported by the backing plate 10 and a latch 36 cooperates with the anchor plate 10 in a first position to fix the anchor plate 34 to the backing plate 10 . The latch 36 is movable to a second position spaced from the anchor plate 10 to permit the latter to move relative to the backing plate 10 . In order to control the position setting of the latch 30 , the latch is coupled to the parking lever 26 so that the latch 36 remains in the first position until the parking lever 26 is moved whereupon the latch 36 is also moved to the second position. Consequently, when the hydraulic actuator 16 is operated in a service brake applica tion, the anchor plate 34 remains fixed to the backing plate 10 to form a non servo drum brake and when the parking brake 26 is operated, the anchor plate 34 is movable with the pair of brake shoes 12, 14 in the direction of the rotatable member 18 to form a duo servo drum brake.
