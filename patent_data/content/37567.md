# Floor, in particular for apartment buildings, and method of erecting the same.

## Abstract
A floor, in particular for apartment buildings, is com posed of timber beams 1 parallel to each other and fixed in load bearing walls combined with continuous concrete slab 2 transversly reinforced to the beams 1 by way of taps 4 and spikes 3 driven into the beams 1 and anchored in concrete slab 2 . A method of floor erection in application for timber floor being renovated by way of timber concrete construction is as follows spikes 3 are driven into timber beams 1 and then reinforced concrete slab 2 is being cast.

## Claims
Claims 1. A floor, in particular for apartment buildings, charac terized in that the basic elements of the floor are the timber beams 1 fixed in load bearing walls parallel to each other and combined with continuous concrete slab 2 , reinforced transversly to the timber beams 1 axis by way of taps 4 and spikes 3 driven into the beams 1 and properly anchored in concrete slab 2 . 2. Floor erection method with application of timber beams of buildings being erected or with timber beams of res novated floor, characterized in that beams 1 are placed in load bearing walls and spikes 3 are driven into them, then concrete slab 2 is being cast.

## Description
Floor, in particular for apartment buildings, and method of erecting the sameThe invention relates to a floor, especially for apartment buildings, and to a method of erecting such a floor.There is a great variety of floors used in apartment build ingnowadays. In old apartment buildings timber floors were generally applied, whereas nowadays precast concrete or in situ reinforced concrete floors are used frequently. Development of heavy prefabrication had mostly eleminated the traditional rib floors widespread in apartment buildings.Instead of rib floors industrially prefabricated big plates of reinforced or prestresed concrete are used. These plates are made in factories and transported to the build ing site, where they are hoisted by cranes on the proper floor of the building.Recent studies regarding the energy crisis and transport consuming have led to conclusions that the most economical constructions are reinforced concrete flate plate ones casted in situ in repeatedly used formworks or erected in lift slab method with. prefabricated columns.Nowadays flat plate constructions casted in situ especially in apartment buildings push out effectively huge precast concrete slabs as well as traditionally ribbed floors.According to invention, the floor consists of timber beams, parallel to each other, fixed in load bearing walls and concrete slab, reinforced in transverse erection to the axis of beams. Shear connectors taps and spikes prevent vertical separation between reinforced concrebDplate and timber beams and they are the basic and shear resisting connectors combining slab with beams assuring their jointly action. Spikes are partially driven into the beams before casting the slab in such a way, that their free ends are long enough Pr mchoring in slab. Taps are additional connectors and in considerable way they decrease relative displacement between slab and beam and that is the reason that deflection of the floor is more reduced.Simultaneous application of taps and spikes is recommended for heavy load floors.The method of floor erection according to invention is as follows fixing the timber beams in the load bearing walls in case of renovated timber floors with good beams they only must b.e impregnated, i fixing the formworks to the beams, hammering the spikes into the beams, placing the reinforcement, net of steel bars, for con crete slab, casting the concrete slab of the floorThe basic advantage of invention is the great strength and small deflection of the floor, The above mentioned advan tages are due to increase of internal force arm and alteration the rectangular section of timber beam into T shape section of the composite structure. Timber beams may be used as a support for suspended, repeatedly used formwork of concrete slab.The concrete timber floor is practically fire resistant if timber beams are protected from below by the ceiling plaster.The solution of the floor according to invention is parti cularly recommended in case of exchanging of timber floors in existing apartment building, Renovation of such floors is reduced to removing of the existing so called blind floor, testing the quality of timber beams and sometimes if necessary reinforcing their ends in the vicinity of their support. As a formwork for casting of a concrete plate, the existing planks of floor fulfilment may be used.Application of the floor according to invention for renovation of the old buildings decreases several times not only labour consumption and material costs, but also accelerates realization of building floor renovation and moreover doubles at least th.e load carrying 6apaity of the composite floor in comparison to timber floor with the same timber beams.The invention is described in detail below with reference to drawings which illustrate specific embodiments, in which Fig. 1 is a longitudinal section along the beam axis of a floor according to the invention with spikes driven into a timber beam,Fig. 2 shows a section A A of the floor in Fig. 1, Fig. 3 shows a floor according to the invention in lon gitudinal section along the beams axis with spi kes and taps, andFig. 4 shows a section B B of the floor in Fig, 3.. The floor according to invention consists of timber beams 1, such beams being situated parallel to each other and supported on load bering walls. Beams 1 are connected with slab 2 by means of spikes 3 driven into beams 1 in such a way, that their free ends are long enoug for proper anchorage in the slab 2. The concrete slab is reinforced transversly to timber beams 1.The timber beam 1 of the floor shown in Fig. 3 and 4 is connected with reinforced concrete slab by means df spikes 3 and additionally by taps 4 made in beam 1.
