# Steering column assembly.

## Abstract
A steering column assembly for a motor vehicle com prises three column parts 1,7,8 connected by universal joints 6,9 and arranged along non coincident axes. A jacket 13 surrounding the upper column part and fixed to the vehicle body includes a collapsable energy absorbing element 16 . The upper column part 1 is rotatably mounted in the jacket 13 by an upper thrust bearing 18 and a lower bearing 19 which includes a bearing member 20 which disengages from the jacket 13 during downward movement of the first column part 1 under impact loads so that the column part 1 can move radially relative to the jacket.
