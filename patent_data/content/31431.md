# Programmable sequential logic array mechanism.

## Abstract
A programmable sequential logic array mechanism is provided for performing logical operations and solving logical equations. The mechanism includes a search array subsystem 1 for receiving a plurality of binary input sig nals via input lines 2 . The search array subsystem in cludes an addressable storage array 3 for supplying input control words for testing for different input signal conditions. The sequential logic array mechanism also includes a read array subsystem 13 for producing a plur ality of binary output signals on output lines 14 . This read array subsystem includes an addressable storage array 15 for supplying output signal control words. The results of the tests performed by the search array subsystem are used to select which one of the output signal control words are allowed to establish or change the read array output signals.
