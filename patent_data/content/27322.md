# Process of electrowinning metals.

## Abstract
The invention provides a process of electrowinning met als from chloride or sulphate solutions in a cell 11 having several anolyte compartments 16 defined by bags 15 that are permeable to electrolyte. Each anolyte compartment 16 has a partially submerged insoluble anode 12 that generates a gas during electrowinning. The electrolyte contains a fro thing agent that, in conjunction with the anodically generated gas, forms a froth 18 which is removed by a suction pipe 19 . Removing spent electrolyte and gas in the form of the froth 18 facilitates the removal of the same amount of electrolyte from each compartment 16 .
