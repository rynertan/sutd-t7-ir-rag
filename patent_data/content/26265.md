# A method of spin imaging in solids using NMR spectrometer.

## Abstract
A method for spin imaging in solids using nuclear magnetic resonance NMR spectroscopy. The invention incudes the steps of placing a sample in a sample holder 12 , positioning the sample holder 12 in an rf coil and an external static magnetic field 16A, 16B, Ho of an NMR spectrometer, rotating the sample about an axis which makes a particular angle 54.7 with the NMR static external magnetic field 16A, 16B, Ho , superimposing a magnetic field gradient on the static external magnetic field, rotating the magnetic field gra dient synchronously with the sample, collecting the data while performing a solid state NMR line narrowing step, and changing the phase relation between the sample rotation and the field gradient rotation on a step by step basis to map out an image of the object.
