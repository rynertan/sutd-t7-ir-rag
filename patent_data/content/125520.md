# A process and a plant for the recovery of one or more constituents from a gas mixture.

## Abstract
A process for the recovery of one or more constituents from a gas mixture containing ethylene oxide and the said constituent or constituents, the ethylene oxide being absorbed in water, whereupon the aqueous solution is removed from the remaining constituents which are less readily soluble in water. The invention is designed in particular to be applied to a gas mixture intended for sterilization purposes comprising beside ethylene oxide gases such as carbon dioxide and or chlorofluorocarbon which are relatively inert from a point of view of sterilization. The invention also relates to a plant for the realization of processes of the abovementioned type. This plant here comprises means 3 for the bringing together of the gas mixture with liquid from a liquid source 6 for at least partial absorption of an undesirable constituent and means 4 for the separation of the non absorbed part of the gas mixture, the said means 3 6 forming part of a recycling circuit which also comprises means 13 15 for the removal of the undesirable constituent.
