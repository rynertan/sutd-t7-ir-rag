# POWER GENERATING SYSTEM UTILIZING THE WAVE MOTION OF THE SEA OR LAKES

## Abstract
The invention relates to a power generating system which utilizes the wave motion of the sea or lakes, and in cludes a buoyant member 11 , preferably of a large size, which is adapted for following the water surface movements, a restrain 1 arranged to govern the buoyant member 11 , at least one pumping apparatus 4 which is arranged to be actuated by the buoyant member and adapted for pump ing a fluid into a storage tank. The fluid from the storage tank can be utilized by a consumption apparatus, such as a turbine, in order to generate power, e.g. electric power.
