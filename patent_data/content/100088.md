# Process for preparing organic solvent soluble amine molybdates.

## Abstract
Amine molybdates are formed by reacting an amine with a molybdenum compound in a reaction mixture comprised of at least two immiscible liquid materials, one of which is an aqueous phase and another of which is a volatile organic sol vent in which the amine molybdate to be formed is readily solu ble. An inorganic or organic acid desirably is added to the reac tion mixture.
