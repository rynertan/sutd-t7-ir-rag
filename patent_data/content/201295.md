# Power conserving self contained downhole gauge system.

## Abstract
A power conserving apparatus for recording information in a well bore includes a plurality of independently energizable electrical circuits for receiving electrical signals from a transducer which senses an environmental condition, for processing the electrical signals, and for storing information related to the detected environmental condition. A power control circuit is provided for continuously providing electrical power to at least one of the electrical circuits and for independently switchably providing electrical power to selectable ones of at least two others of the separately energizable circuits.
