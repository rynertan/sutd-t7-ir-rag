# Viscous fan drive.

## Abstract
A pumping element 64 configured in assembly as a generally L shaped member having an axially extending portion 76 interposed between the inner peripheral sur face 54 of the housing and the outer peripheral surface 52 of the clutch 16 of a viscous drive to direct fluid be tween two side surface 80, 82 radially inwardly toward a radial front edge 96a of a radially extending portion 78 of the pumping element thereafter into the outlet opening 72 in the pump plate 26 . The pumping element allows for the construction of a viscous drive having a relatively low angular velocity in the disengaged mode, a relatively high angular velocity in the engaged mode without high speed pump out, and a relatively short pump out time.
