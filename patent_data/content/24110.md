# Multiple roll developing apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus 11 for applying toner particles 12 to a photoconductive surface 28 having multiple magnetic brushes 16,22 each of which consists essentially of a magne tic inner shaft 15,20 and a nonmagnetizable outer sleeve 19,24 with both the sleeve and the inner shaft of each brush being capable of independent rotation. The apparatus uses an adjustably mounted doctor blade 31 to apply toner particles to one of the brushes. The rotation of the inner shafts 15,20 and sleeves 19,24 of the brushes, the spacings between the brushes 16,22 , as well as the magnetic attraction between the brushes affords the transfer of toner 12 from this first brush 16 to the other brushes 22 . Following the transfer of toner, each brush 16,22 is able to apply toner 12 to the photoconductive surface 28 .
