According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a fungicidal, insecticidal and or acaricidal composition comprising an effective amount of the compound having the formula I and inert additive s and or carrier s . In the event of cultivating plants for agriculture or horticulture, numerous preventive chemicals are used to control the injurious fungi, insects and or mites to the plants or crops, however, in some occasion, the preventive effects thereof are not sufficient or plants or crops are polluted by phytotoxicity thereof or they have strong poisonous influence to human, animal or fish, so that a big number of preventive chemicals can not be said satisfactory chemicals or become inadequate to commercially apply on the plants. Consequently, appearance of preventive chemicals which are free from above drawbacks and can be used in safety is eagerly required. The inventors, paying attentions to above drawbacks, carried out investigation on numerous compounds, and as the results, they discovered that the compound having the formula I indicates a superior fungicidal effect to the various plant disease fungi. Formamidoxim derivatives having hydrogen atom at the place of R of the formula I are disclosed in U.S.P. 4,237,168, however, in the specification of which any fungicidal activity of such compound is not shown and the insecticidal activity is solely appeared. We have very famous and world widely by prevailing fungicides since about 1970 developed for agriculture and horticulture so called benzimidazole thiophanate series fungicidal compounds11 which include benomyl methyl l butylcarbamoyl benzimidazole 2 yl carbamate , fuberidazole 2 2 furyl benzimidazole , thiabendazole 2 4 thiazolyl benzimidazole , carbendazim methyl benzimidazole 2yl carbamate , thiophanate methyl 1,2 bis 3 methoxycarbonyl 2 thioureido benzene and thiophanate 1,2 bis 3 ethoxycarbonyl 2 thioureido benzene or the like, which indicate a suprerior exterminating effect to the various disease germs as the parasites of the agriculture and horticulture plants and crops and served grate to multiply production of the crops hereinafter called as benzimidazolethiophanate series compounds . But if the same fungicides as above have been sprayed continuously on the plants and crops at the same field for a long period, the fungi such treated will obtain a resistance against such benzimidazole thiophanate series compounds such resistant fungi are hereinafter called as Chemical Resistant Fungi and will prevail increasingly and thereby the preventive effect of the fungicides will be deteriorated to a status that the said fungicides can not be practically used. In such event, the farmer, in other words the user of said fungicides, will be obliged to use another effective fungicide to exterminate the chemical resistant fungi, if any. However, it is regretifully that any superior fungicide comparatively same efficacious as benzimidazole thiophanate series fungicides before ChemicalResistant Fungi had become prevail has not yet appeared in the market so that it is difficult to secure adequate preventive means against plant diseases. The inventors, taking into consideration of above circumstances, eagerly synthesized a great number of novel compounds and thoroughly evaluated their fungicidal activity against Chemical Resistant Fungi, because if they indicate strong selective fungicidal activities against Chemical Resistant Fungi, the high preventive effect can be expected for the plants in the field whereChemical Resistant Fungi are prevailing. As the results, they discovered that a compound having the formula I1 and having at least one B radical such compound is hereinafter called as B Y compound has a selective preventive effect to the plant disease caused byChemical Resistant Fungi. In other words, they found that the compound set forth above has the selective fungicidal activity against Chemical ResistantFungi. Contrary to a superior high fungicidal activity against Chemical ResistantFungi, B Y compound does not or hardly show the preventive effect against injurious diseases caused by fungi sensitive to benzimidazole thiophanate series compounds such fungi are hereinafter called as Chemical Sensitive Fungi as manifested in the later Tests. Therefore, it should be stated that B Y compound has a highly sensitive selectivity on the fungicidal activity to ChemicalResistant Fungi. As for the intensity of the selective fungicidal activity to ChemicalRegistant Fungi of B Y compound, the compound having B Y radical at 3 and or 4 positions of phenyl group thereof has a very strong said selective fungicidal activity, however, the compound having B Y radical solely at the 2 position seems to have rather weak activity. In case that B is 0 , said selective activity would come the strongest in comparison with the corresponding B Y compound having a fragment B other than 0 . Taking into account of the conditions of the practically applying fields in which Chemical Resistant Fungi and Chemical Sensitive Fungi are miscibly spreading on plants, mixtures having a numerous kind of combination of a compound selected from the B Y compounds and a compound selected from benzimidazole thiophanate series compounds hereinafter called as Mixed Chemicals are tested on the preventive effect against various diseases of plants in comparison with single compound before such conbination, and it was discovered and confirmed the unexpectedly superior efficacy of such combination for the prevention of plant deseases caused by infection of either Chemical Resistant Fungi or ChemicalSensitive Fungi or the mixture thereof hereinafter called as Mixed Fungi . Therefore, now it can be stated that the plant deceases almost uncurable because of infection of Mixed Fungi have become able to be completely curable by applying a mixed fungicide of such combination of two specific kinds of active ingredients as shown above, i. e. Mixed Chemicals. Furthermore, it was extremely surprising that Mixed Chemicals showed unexpectedly superior efficacy for exterminating Chemical Resistant Fungi as well as Chemical Sensitive Fungi, those of which are separately cultivated.For example, Mixed Chemicals shows 5 to 10 times of fungicidal activity against either kind of fungi as shown above on the basis of activity of B Y compounds against Chemical Resistant Fungi and activity of Benzimidazole ThiophanateSeries Compounds against Chemical Sensitive Fungi. Accordingly, Mixed Chemicals of this invention should express their superior fungicidal power at miscellaneous conditions of fungi in the practical agricultural or horticultural fields. For example, Cercospora leaf spot Cercospora beticola of beet, Cercospora leaf spot Cercospora arachidicola and leaf spot Cercospora personata of peanut, powdery mildew Sphaerotheca fuliginea , Gummy stem blight Mycosphaerella melonis , Sclerotinia rot Sclerotinia sclerotiorum , gray mould Botrytis cinerea and scab Cladosporium cucumerinum of cucumber, gray mould Botrytis cinerea and leaf mould Cladosporium fulvum of tomato, gray mould Botrytis cinerea , black rot Corynespora melongenae and powdery mildew Erysiphe cichoracearum of eggplant, gray mould Botrytis cinerea and powdery mildew Sphaerotheca humuli of strawberry, gray mould neck rot Botrytis alli and gray mould Botrytis cinerea of onion, powdery mildew Erysiphe cichoracearum of tobacco, Sclerotinia rot Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and gray mould Botrytis cinerea of kidney bean, powdery mildew Podosphaera leucotricha , scab Venturia inaequalis and blossom blight Sclerotinia mali of apple, powdery mildew Phyllactinia kakicola , anthracnose Gloeosporium kaki and Angular leaf spot Cercospora kaki of persimmon, brown rot Sclerotinia cinerea of peach and cherry fruit, gray mould Botrytis cinera , powdery mildew Uncinula necator or ripe rot Glomerella cingulata of grape, scab Venturia nashicola of pear, gray blight Pestalotia theae and anthracnose Co ilet otrichum theae sinensis of tea plant, scab Elsinoe fawcetti , blue mould Penicillium italicum and common green mould Penicillium digitatum of orange, powdery mildew Erysiphe graminis f. sp. hordei , eye spot Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides andFusarium snow blight Fusarium nivale of barley, powdery mildew Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici of wheat or the like may be exterminated. Further, as metioned above, the farmer, in other words the user of preventive fungicides, was encountered to the difficulties incleased by prevailing ChemicalResistant Fungi and become unable to secure the prevention of disease injury of plants and crops caused by Chemical Resistant Fungi or a mixture of ChemicalResistant Fungi and Chemical Sensitive Fungi, i.e. Mixed Fugni. Since about 1980, fungicides containing cyclic imide series compounds such as N 31 ,5 1 dichlorophenyl l,2 dimethylcyclopropane l,2 dicarboxytuide, 3 3 ,5 dichlorophenyl 2 isopropylcarbamoylimidazolidine 2, 4 dione or 3 3 ,5 dichloro phenyl 5 methyl 5 vinyloxazolidine 2,4dione have been sold in the market. The cyclic imide series compounds indicate a strong fungicidal activity toChemical Resistant Fungi as well as Chemical Sensitive Fungi. Especially, they indicate a surperior fungicidal activity to gray mould Betrytis cinerea of grape or vegetables and brown rot Sclerotinia cinerea of peach or cherry fruits. In so far as those disease injuries, the farmers obtained tentative success on taking counter measure for prevention of Chemical Resistant Fungi by utilizing the fungicides containing cyclic imide series compounds. However, fungi resistant to cyclic imide series compounds also appeared and the preventive effect of such fungicides to the fungous injuries of plants consequently had become deteriorate. Under the consideration to the above cirumstances, the inventors adopted four kinds of combined fungi Botrytis cinerea , i. e. fungi sensitive to benzimidazOle thiophanate series compounds and sensitive to cyclic imide series compounds hereinafter designated as BT S CI S , fungi sensitive to benzimidazole thiophanate series compounds and resistant to cyclic imide series compounds hereinafter designated as BT S CI R , fungi resistant to benzimidazole thiophanate series compounds and sensitive to cyclic imide series compounds hereinafter designated as BT R CI S and fungi resistant to benzimidazole thiophanate series compounds and resistant to cyclic imide series compounds hereinafter designated as BT R CI R hereinafter collectively called as Combined Fungi for the test to confirm the fungicidal activity of the compounds of this invention against Combined Fungi. As the results, it was found that the compound of this invention having an extremely highly selective fungicidal activity to fungi having property of BT R always has extremely highly fungicidal activity to the Combined Fungi having BT R property regardless whether the fungi are resistant or sensitive to cyclic imide series compounds or so other fungicidal compounds . Contrary to the above mentioned facts, notwithstanding, B Y compound indicates also preventive effect to the plant diseases such as rice blast, cucumber downy mildew or the like, irrespective of whether the fungi causing above diseases are resistant or sensitive to benzimidazole thiophanate series compounds. A compound having the formula I further has an insecticidal and or acaricidal activity to injurious insects such as Army worm, Aphids species orGreen rice leafhopper etc. and the injurious acari such as two spotted spider mite etc. According to a third aspect of the invention, there are provided processes for the preparation of the compound having the formula I , comprising the step of reacting as illustrated by the following equations 1 , 3 and 4 .

The seedling was air dried and then inoculated with conidia of powdery mildew Spnaerotheca fuliginer Chemical Resistant Fungi, Chemical SensitiveFungi or Mixed Fungi. Each seedling pot was separately or distantly kept in the greenhouse at about 250C. The disease occurrence status was investigated at 10th day after the inoculation. The disease index was calculated with the following method. In the other words, disease index was classified as 0, 1, 2, 3 ... 10 in compliance with appearance of disease spots on each leaf. The preventive value of each compound or each of Mixed Chemicals were calculated by the following calculating formula of the preventive value.Disease index Occurrence status of disease lesion or spots 0 ... Any disease lesion or any disease spot is not entirely indentified on leaf surface. 1 ... One to five pieces of disease spots appeare on leaf surface. 2 ... 6 to 10 pieces of disease spots appeare on leaf surface. 3 ... 30Z of surface area of the leaf is affected with the disease lesion or spots. 4 ... 31 40 of surface area of leaf is affected with the lesion or spots. 5 ... 41 50Z of surface area of leaf is affected with the lesion or spots. 6 ... 51 60 of surface area of leaf is affected with the lesion or spots. 7 ... 61 70 of surface area of leaf is affected with the lesion or spots. 8 ... 71 80 of surface area of leaf is affected with the lesion or spots. 9 ... 81 90Z of surface area of leaf is affected with the lesion or spots. 10 ... 91 100 of surface area of leaf is affected with the lesion or spots.

test comound, and sprayed over young seedling of beet Variety Monohil, in the 5th to the 6th leaf stage cultivated in a porous unglazed pot having 9 cm of diameter. The leaves were air dried and inoculated with conidia of cercospora leaf spot Cercospora beticola resistant or sensitive to benzimidazole thiophanate series compounds or a mixture thereof by means of spraying. The inoculated young beets were placed in the high humid room at 24 26 C for one day and kept in the greenhouse at 23 280C for 12 days. Then, occurrence status of disease spots was investigated. In compliance with the following standard method, disease indexes, as shown below, in each treating zone were surveyed, and preventive values were calculated by the following preventive value calculating formula The Disease Index Occurrence Status of Disease Spots 0 Disease occurrence was not entirely identfied. 0.5 3 5 pieces of disease spots were identfied on a leaf. 1 10 25 of leaf
