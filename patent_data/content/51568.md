# Lid for sealingly closing a container.

## Abstract
A lid is provided for sealing containers intended mainly for containing foodstuff to be pasteurised or substances which generate a pressure in the container greater than the external pressure. The lid, constituted by a cap portion 8 moulded from a plastics material which is resistant to mechanical forces, is formed both with a wall 10 extending transversely of the mouth 2 of the container and with a side wall 7 rigid with the transverse wall 10 . The cap portion 8 also has a plate like part 11 of yielding plastics material moulded directly onto the inner surface 9 of the transverse wall 10 of the cap portion 8 so as to form therewith a unitary body without interstices. This avoids the possibility of substances being retained in the lid and deteriorating which could jeopardize the hygienic nature of the product placed in the container, particularly upon re use of the latter.

## Description
Lid for Sealingly Closing a Container The present invention relates to a lid for sealingly closing containers in general, of glass or plastics material, particularly of the type with a comparatively large mouth and intended mainly for containing foodstuffs to be pasteurized or substances which generate a pressure within the container greater than the external pressure. The lid to which the present invention relates is of the cap type made of plastics material resistant to mechanical forces and formed both with a wall arranged to extend transversely across the mouth of the container to be closed and with an annular side wall rigid with the transverse wall, the cap being provided with fastening means for engagement with cooperating means carried by the outer surface of the neck of the container. According to the known art, the seal between the lid and the mouth of the container is ensured by the presence of a washer of yielding material inserted in the cavity of the lid and optionally accommodated in a suitable groove in the lid top. It has been found in practice that this type of lid although ensuring a good seal, has serious disadvantages relating to the hygienic conditions in which the product finds itself, especially during subsequent re use of the container. Indeed, since the sealing washer is formed as a piece separate from the remaining cap portion of the lid, it is not possible to avoid the penetration of a small quantity of product or other extraneous substances between the washer itself and the underlying transverse wall of the lid with the consequent formation of germs and dirt which eventually results in pollution of the product. The object of the present invention is thus to avoid the formation of pollutents which, by coming into contact with the product, could cause it to deteriorate. The problem which is at the root of the present invention is that of forming a lid which, on the one hand can ensure a good seal, both at high and low pressures and, on the other hand, avoids the possibility of pollution of the product placed in the container. The problem is resolved in accordance with the present invention, by a lid of the type specified above which is characterised in that the cap portion, formed by moulding from a plastics material resistant to mechanical forces, includes a plate like portion of yielding plastics material formed by moulding directly onto the inner surface of the transverse wall of the cap which faces towards the mouth of the container, the said yielding plastics material being compatible with that of the cap portion to form a unitary body. More particularly, the said material which is resistant to mechanical forces can be a type of propylene polymer, while the yielding material is an ethylenepropylene type elastomer. According to a preferred aspect of the invention, the plate like portion of yeilding plastics material has a flexible annular lip projecting towards the interior of the cap portion of the lid, the lip being located peripherally in a position opposite the rim of the mouth of the container and being inclined to an axis perpendicular to the transverse wall of the cap portion. The invention will now be more fully described with reference to an example of a practical embodiment given purely by way of example, illustrated in the appended drawings in which Figure 1 is a cross section of a lid incorporating the invention, for the case in which the interior of the container is at a lower pressure than the external environment Figure 2 is a cross section of a lid incorporating the invention, for the case in which the interior of the container is at a higher pressure than the external environment. With reference to Figure 1, by 1 is shown the neck of a general type of container, particularly of the type with a mouth 2,which is large relative to the rest of the body, not illustrated. The outer wall 3 of the neck 1 has a cbnventional screw thread 4 for engagement by a complimentary screw thread 5 formed on the inner surface 6 of the side wall 7 of a cap portion indicated in its entirety by 8. This cap portion has, on an internal surface 9 of the transverse wall 10, a plate like part 11 with an annular lip 12 projecting inwardly of the lid itself. This annular lip 12 is located peripherally in a position opposite the rim 13 of the neck 1. The cap portion 8 of the lid, that is to say, the side wall 7, the complimentary screw thread 5 and the transverse wall 10, is moulded from a plastics material, for example a polypropylene polymer, which is resistant to mechanical forces. The plate like part 11, with its annular lip 12, is on the other hand, moulded from a yielding plastics material, such as an ethylene propylene elastomer, which is compatible with the propylene polymer used for moulding the cap portion 8. In practice, the formation of the lid according to the invention is carried out by conventional double moulding methods one of the two parts is formed first, for example by injection into a suitable mould, and subsequently the other part is formed directly on the first, the material being changed. In this manner a lid is fumed as a unitary body totally free from any interstices between the surface 9 of the transverse wall 10 and the plate like part 11. Consequently the penetration of product or extraneous substance between the wall 10 and part 11 is avoided thereby guaranteeing a completely hygienic closure. With particular reference to Figure 1, it is seen that the lip 12 is inclined to the axisX X perpendicular to the transverse wall 10 60 that its free edge faces the peripheral wall 7 of the cap portion 8. This inclination allows the lid to be used in cases in which the interior of the container will be at a lower pressure than the external environment as occurs when the product is pasteurized. With reference however to Figure 2, in which all the elements corresponding to those of Figure 1 have been indicated by the same reference numerals it is seen that the annular lip 12 is inclined to the axis X X at an inclination such that the free edge faces inwardly of the cap portion 8. This conformation is particularly suitable for cases in which the interior of the container will be at a higher pressure than the external environment as occurs when aerated liquids or beverages are contained. In addition to the basic technical result specified above , the invention further allows the use of coloured plastics material in the formation of the cap portion 8 withoutdanser of contamination of the product placed in the container since the presence of the platelike part 11 stops any possible migration of the colouring substances to the product.
