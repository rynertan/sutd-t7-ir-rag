# Method of making expandable styrene type polymer beads.

## Abstract
Expandable styrene type polymer beads having a short cooling time are obtained by a method wherein styrene type polymer beads are impregnated with a blowing agent prefer ably as a step separate and independent of the polymerization step or in the same suspension polymerization reactor after a substantial completion of the polymerization, in an aqueous suspension comprising styrene type polymer beads, a blowing agent, a suspending agent, at least 0.0001 of a halide salt of a transition metal selected from the group consisting of iron, ti tanium, vanadium, chromium, manganese, cobalt, nickel and copper, or a mixture thereof, and at least 0.001 of glycerol mono , di , or tri ester of a fatty acid having 12 30 carbon at oms or a mixture thereof, said halide being bromide, chloride or iodide, and said percentages being based on the total weight of polymer beads subjected to the impregnation, with the proviso that if said glycerol ester is a tri ester, there must be present at least 0.0001 of a bromide salt of said transition metal or a mixture thereof.
