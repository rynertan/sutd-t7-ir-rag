## Description
SULPHONATED POLYARYLETHERKET NES The present invention relates to certain sulphonated polyaryletherketone polymers. Certain polyarylethers containing the repeat unit of formulaEMI1.1 where X is SO2 or CO have been found to undergo interesting and useful sulphonation reactions in concentrated sulphuric acid 98 w w . The polyarylethersulphone containing only the repeat unit A in which X is SO2 dissolves in the concentrated sulphuric acid and sulphonates very rapidly to give a completely water soluble product, due to the monosubstitution of SO20H groups in all or most of the aromatic rings in the sub unwits EMI1.2 of the polymer see Example 4 . In the case of the polyaryletherketone containing only the repeat unit A in which X is CO , however, dissolution of the polymer in concentrated sulphuric acid 98 w w occurs but monosulphonation of the sub unitsEMI1.3 is much slower. Consequently the degree to which a polymer of repeat unit A in which X is CO can be sulphonated may be readily controlled by controllingsthe conventional factors affecting sulphonation degree in concentrated sulphuric acid, and in particular the time of sulphonation. In this way the hydrophilicity of the resulting sulphonated polymer can be readily controlled. Additionally, while the sulphonation of polymers containing only the repeat unit A in which X is SO2 is almost instantaneous and cannot be controlled, unlike the case where X is CO , polyarylethersuiphones containing only the repeat unit of formulaEMI2.1 are virtually non susceptible to sulphonation in concentrated sulphuric acid 98 w w , the sulphuric acid dissolving the polymer but not changing it seeExample 5 , even though other sulphonating agents such as oleum and chlorosulphonic acid, and even a azure of concentrated sulphuric acid 98 w w with a little cleum, completely sulphonate the polymer and or der de it seeExamples 6 and 7 .Consequently polyaryletherketone sulphone copolymers containing the repeat unit A in whichX is CO and the repeat unit B may also be controllably sulphonated in concentrated sulphuric acid 98 w w to give hydrophilic sulphonated copolymers, According to the present invention there is provided a polyaryletherketone polymer which is a drophilic sulphonated polymer derived by controllably sulphonating a polymer having the repeat unit of formulaEMI2.2 alone or in conjunction with the repeat unIt of formulaEMI2.3 the latter units, if present, remaining substantially nonsulphonated after sulphonation. The extent of the sulphonation In con entrated sulphuric acid 98 w w of the units A in tLicr X is ZO slows down with increasing time and it may require a very long sulphonation period to obtain a polyaryletherketone according to the invention in which more than 90 of these units are aulphonated. The control of of the sulphonation reaction should be such that the vesulting polymer preferably has a degree o hydrophilicity ccrresponding to a water absorption capacity at ambient temperature of about 2 weight water abscrption tc complete solubility in water. The hydrophilic polymers of the invention which pro absor 5 75 weight water at ambient temperature are rotrntially useful as membrane materials, e.g. for ltrawfilkrssion processes such as desalination and removal of microorganisms, since they are not only hydrophilie in charscter but retain considerable strength even when containing m significant quantity of water e.g.up to 20 weight i vater . loners of e above defined polymers which are sulphonated with SO2OH groups may be readily prepared e.g. by converting the SO2OH groups to salts such as SO3 here M an alkali metal or NR4, R being an alkyl grosp , these too have utility as hydrophilic polymers. Accordingly, the sulphonyl groups on the polymers of the intention preferably have the formula SO2OY where Y is H, an alkali metal, or NR4 where R is an alkyl group. A sulphonated polyaryletherketone polymer according to the present invention mat also possess further utility in that it may, if used in admixture with a nonsulphonated polymer of repeat unit A in which X is CO , cause the polymer mixture to undergo cross linking if heated at a suitable temperature thereby improving certain properties of the non sulphenated polymer such as softening point and resistance to solvents under stress. Such a cross linking technique could usefully be applied to fabricated articles made from non sulphonated polymers of repeat unit A in which X is CO having inherent viscosity IV of at least 0.7 measured at 250C as 0.1 solution in H2SO4 of density 1.84 , which have excellent mechanical and electrical properties coupled with outstanding thermal and combustion characteristics and are particularly advantageous when used as insulation for electrical conductors and in particular as insulating coatings for wires and cables in that they exhibit high resistance to attack by solvents and to heat stress embrittlement.Cross linking of such a fabricated article could e.g. be effected by steeping the article in concentrated sulphuric acid, removing the article from the sulphuric acid bath and washing out any non absorbed sulphuric acid, and then heating the article to cause sulphonation of some of the polymer chains and concomitant cross linking. This could provide a cross linked sulphonated article of still further improved properties, particularly in respect of resistance to solvent stress cracking. Polyaryletherketone polymers of repeat unit A in which X is CO alone or in conjunction with repeat unitB and having IV of at least 0.7 may be conveniently prepared by condensation of hydroquinone, 4,4 difluorobenzophenone and, where units B are present, 4,4 dihydroxydiphenylsulphone, and an alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate in the presence of an aromatic sulphone solvent at 150 4000C as described in our European PatentPublication No. 0 001 879. The present invention is now illustrated by the following examples. EXAMPLE 1 A homopolymer of repeat unit A in which X is CO 20 g , IV 1.0 , was shaken for 18 hours with concentrated sulphuric acid 98 w w 100 ml to give a very viscous solution. Next morning further concentrated sulphuric acid 100 ml was added and shaking continued for a further 6 hours i.e. 22 hours in all . Some of this solution 50 ml was then poured into distilled water 500 ml in a Waring blender to give a white precipitate which was filtered off and then washed three times with further water in the blender, separated each, time by filtration.The product was left wet oversight. Next morning the water wet product was found tci be soluble in boiling dimethyl formamide and in boiling dimethyl sulphoxide and did not precipitate on cooling. Analysis by 220 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy of a solution in dimethyl sulphoxide showed that 35 of the repeat units bore SO2OH groups. Further portions of the homopolymer of repeat unit A in which X is CO were similarly suiphonated by shaking in concentrated sulphuric acid 98 w w for periods of 3 hours, 46 hours, 10 weeks and.ll weeks. The products had the following properties 3 hours Insoluble in dimethyl sulphoxide and therefore not analysed by nmr .46 hours 56 of repeat units bore an SO2OH group, actually determined on the sodium salt, which was precipitated by adding the sulphonation solution to 10 volumes of sodium hydroxide solution 5 weight in water, and was soluble in dimethyl sulphoxide. 10 weeks 89 of repeat units bore an SO2OH group. Product was soluble in, ater but i precipitated by 5 sulphufic acid in water.11 weeks 90 of repeat unit8 bore an S020H group, EXAMPLE 2 A homopolymer of repeat unit A in which X is CO 20 g , IV 1.0 , was dropped into stirred concentrated sulphuric acid 988 w w 500 ml and the mixture shaken from time to time during the next few hours to help dissolve the polymer. Samples of the solution 50 ml were withdrawn at various times and precipitated each time by pouring the acid solution into distilled water 500 ml in a Waring blender to give a precipitate which was filtered off, reslurried in distilled water in the blender, separated by filtration and washed twice with water.The product samples corresponding to the various times of sulphonation were analysed by 220 MHz nmr spectroscopy as solutions in dimethyl sulphoxide and found to have the following properties 1 hour Not analysed as insoluble in dimethyl sulphoxide. 2 hours Not analysed as insoluble in dimethyl sulphoxide. 3.5 hours Not analysed as insoluble in dimethyl sulphoxide. 7 hours 43 of repeat units bore an SO2OH group. 23 hours 62 of repeat units bore an SO2OH group. 31 hours 75 of repeat units bore an 502011 group. 48 hours 83 of repeat units bore an SO2OH group. All the sulphonated repeat units appeared to be mono sulphonMted on the. sub repeat unitsEMI6.1 if c s ina sa d EXAMPLE 3 The e water absorption of the polymers of Example 2 that had been sulphonated for 23 hours, 31 hours and 48 hours respectively were measured after steeping initially of the polymere cast from solution in dimethylformamide in water for 24 hours at ambient temperature. The values obtained were 24 weight , 59 weight and 70 weight respectively. EXAMPLE 4 A homopolymer of repeat unit A in which X is S02 10 g was dissolved in concentrated sulphuric acid 98 w w with stirring and samples 50 ml removed from time to time and precipated into saturated sodium sulphate or dilute sulphuric acid the polymer samples corresponding to the various times of sulphonation were analysed by 220MHz nmr spectroscopy as solutions in dimethylsulphoxide and found to have the following properties 1 hour 85 of the units bore an SO2OH group isolated as Na salt .2 hours 99 of the units bore an SO2OR group isolated as Na salt .4.5 hours 100 of the units bore an SO2OH group isolated as Na salt . 3 hours 98 of the units bore an SO2OH group isolated as free acid .substantially all the sub units bore one S020H group. EXAMPLE 5 A homopolymer containing the repeat unit B 50 g was dissolved in concentrated sulphuric acid 98 w w 200 ml , left for 72 hours, precipitated in dilute sulphuric acid, washed, macerated and dried. The infrared and nmr spectra of the product showed it to be identical with the starting material. EXAMPLE 6 A homopolymer containing the repeat unit B 20 g was added to chlorosulphonic acid 100 ml . Slight effervescence was apparent and white fumes were evolved.After standing overnight the total time of the polymer in the acid being 20 hours , the solution was poured into 300 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid 98 w w and this solution then poured onto ice. A very fine precipitate resulted, which filtered very slowly and was washed once with water and then dried. The product appeared to be almost entirely soluble in water indicating a high degree of sulphonation. EXAMPLE 7 A homopolymer of repeat unit B 20 g was mixed with oleum 150 ml and left overnight. The resulting black solution still contained undissolved polymer and so the mixture was stored for a further 5 hours, and then poured into water. No precipatate was obtained, but instead a brownish orange solution wan obtained. The product was discarded, being assumed to be highly sulphonated or entirely degraded. In another experiment, the bonopolymer of repeat unit B 15 g was dissolved in concentrated sulphuric acid 98 w w oleum 50 ml was then added and the solution stirred for 30 minutes and then poured onto ice and left overnight. A rubbery white solid was precipated and was washed and dried. This product was found to be highly sulphonated.
