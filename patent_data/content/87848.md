## Description
FRAMEWORK SUCH AS A WINDOW FRAME. The invention relates to a frame, for example, a window frame comprising a plurality of frame parts bounding an opening and interconnected at angles to one another, at least one frame part having a longitudinal groove in a side face accommodating a jamb protruding out of the side face for an element closing the opening. In such a known window frame the longitudinal groove has a rectangular section so that the jamb is countersunk in the frame part concerned. In this way no troublesome visible gap can occur between the jamb and the side face of the frame part. Moreover, the jamb is more capable of transferring forces to the frame part so that, in fact, a construction is obtained corresponding in this respect with a construction in which a frame part and a jamb are cut from a single beam. With respect to this construction the known window frame has the advantage of less waste material. The invention has for its object to improve a frame of the kind set forth in the preamble. This is achieved in that the groove is formed by an undercut groove widening from the side face to the interior, for example, a dovetail grove and in that the jamb has a profile fitting therein and protruding therefrom. It is thus ensured that the jamb cannot escape laterally out of the frame part and, on the contrary, constitutes herewith an undetachable unit. Even when the material of the frame, mostly wood, is warping, the jamb cannot disengage from the frame part. The undercut groove in a frame part may, in accordance with the invention, be very effectively used for the connection with a further frame part. In such a preferred embodiment of the frame said further frame part is provided with an extension at the head end, which fits in the undercut groove and is profiled accordingly. In this way, by appreciably fewer operations, that is to say, only the machining of one head end, a carpenter s joint is formed, which meets every requirement. According to a further aspect of the invention the frame part can be connected with a further frame part by an angular tie piece having a first, profiled limb fitting in the undercut groove of the frame part and a second, profiled limb fitting in a recess of the other frame part. By means of these angular tie pieces window frames can be assembled in a very simple manner. When in accordance with the invention a covering lath concealing at least one limb of the angular tie piece is used, the transverse seam between the limb concerned and the adjacent part of the jamb is covered. In this way the angular tie pieces permit of assembling a window frame having a fully professional appearance. In order to obtain a permanent joint the frame parts and the angular tie pieces are preferably glued to one another. In order to ensure satisfactory adhesion of the glue the angular tie pieces are provided, in accordance with the invention, on the surfaces being in contact with the frame parts with grooves. The invention furthermore relates to and provides a beam provided in a side face with an undercut, longitudinal groove and with a fillet being slidable and fitting therein, said beam being apparently intended for making a frame as defined above. By keeping a number of such beams on stock a frame of desired dimensions can be made within a particularly short time at any desired instant. In accordance with a further aspect of the invention it is particularly advantageous to provide such a beam at one head end with a suitably profiled extension fitting in a longitudinal groove of a corresponding beam. Such beams can be simply manufactured in a number of standard lengths in the factory. For example, in order to make a window frame from four beams of this kind, these beams and the jambs need only be shortened to the desired length by a straight sawcut, after which the resultant frame parts can be simply slipped one into the other and be secured by glue. According to the invention it is thus possible to make a frame from such beams that satisfies the highest requirements of a carpenter s product without the need for professional skill. The invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the drawings of embodiments. Fig. 1 is a fragmentary, perspective view of a window frame embodying the invention in the built in state. Fig. 2 is a partial, perspective view of the window frame of Fig. 1.

Fig. 9 shows a window frame assembled by means of the angular tie pieces in accordance with the invention. Fig. 10 is a fragmentary, perspective view in the direction of the arrow X in Fig. 9. Fig. 11 is a side elevation of an angular tie piece designated by XI. Fig. 12 shows a frame assembled in accordance with a further embodiment of the invention. Fig. 13 is a fragmentary front view of the frame ofFig. 12. Figs. 14 to 17 are perspective views of angular tie pieces taken at XIV to XVII in Fig. 3. Fig. 18 is a sectional view taken on the lineXVIII XVIII in Fig. 13. Fig. 19 is a sectional view taken on the line XIXXIX in Fig. 13. The frame shown in Fig. 1 is a door frame comprising vertical posts 2, 3 and a girder 4 arranged between the top ends of said posts 2, 3. In the opening of the frame 1 a jamb 5 is arranged to retain a door 6 pivotally connected with the frame 1. As is shown in Fig. 1 and more particularly in Fig. 2, the frame parts 2, 3, 4 have on the side remote from the door opening, a recess 8 bounded by rims 13 and receiving the masonry 7 in which the door frame is arranged.The masonry 7 is finished with a layer of plaster and the seam between the frame 1 and the plaster 9 is covered by a covering panel 10. Fig. 2 clearly shows that the frame parts 1, 2, 3 are provided in the side faces 11 adjacent the opening with a longitudinal groove 15 holding. the jamb 5. The longitudinal groove 15 has the shape of a dovetail and the jamb 5 has a protruding dovetail profile fitting therein. At their head ends the posts 2, 3 are provided with a protruding part 16 having the same dovetail profile. This extension 16 is engaged in the longitudinal groove 15 of the girder 4. For making the door frame 1 it is, therefore, only necessary t6 shorten the girder 4 at a right angle and the posts 2, 3 have to be provided with a dovetail shaped extension 16. As is shown in Fig. 2 the head end 14 of the girder 4 has furthermore a recess corresponding with the recess 8 in the posts 2, 3. The material of the girder 4 can be simply cut away between the rims 13. It is, however, not necessary to provide the recess in the head end 14 of the girder 4. The fixation of the frame in the masonry 7 is, of course, sufficiently ensured by the recesses in the side faces of the frame parts 1, 2, 3. Fig. 3 shows a beam 17, from which the frame parts 1, 2, 3 of the door frame 1 of Figs. 1 and 2 are made. It is apparent that the beam 17 is provided with the dovetailshaped, longitudinal groove 18 in the side face directed towards the opening. The jamb 19 is formed by a dovetailprofiled part 20 and a protruding part 21 and can be slidably received in the longitudinal groove 18. On the other side the beam 17 has a recess 23, the rims 22 of which serve to be locked in the masonry. Although a dovetail joint is preferred, the invention is not limited to such a shape of the cross sectional area of the longitudinal groove. Any undercut shape in which the jamb is displaceable but not removable in a transverse direction of the groove will be satisfying. Fig. 4 shows how the jambs 27, 28 of the frame parts 25, 26 are shortened to establish a connection between two frame parts both having a longitudinal groove. At its head end the frame part 26 is provided with a dovetail shaped extension engaging the longitudinal groove of the frame part 25. The jamb 28 of the frame part 26 also extends in the longitudinal groove of the frame part 25. The jamb 27 is shortened at a right angle. However, as an alternative the jamb 27 may be engaged in the longitudinal groove of the frame part 26, whilst the frame part 26 itself engages the frame part 25 in the manner shown.The frame parts 25, 26 can then be interconnected by first inserting the end of the jamb 27 into the groove of the frame part 26 and by subsequently inserting the extension of the frame part 26 into the longitudinal groove of the frame part 25, the jamb 27 then sliding in the direction of length. When the jamb has to be disposed close to the side of the frame, it can be designed as is shown in the sectional view of Fig. 5. The protruding part 30 of the jamb 27 is offset with respect to the profiled part thereof. Therefore, the profiled part satisfactorily engages the middle of the frame part 25. Fig. 6 shows a further embodiment of a frame part 29, in which the same jamb 27 is used. This embodiment is intended for a so called flat door, whereas the embodiment ofFig. 5 is intended for a frame covering door. The frame parts 25 and 29 could also accommodate a jamb having the shape shown in Fig. 3. Therefore, by combining given frame parts with given jambs a frame can be obtained in which doors or windows of different thicknesses can be mounted. Fig. 7 shows a preferred embodiment of a beam in accordance with the invention for making a frame. The frame parts 35, 36 shown are each made from such a beam which is provided in accordance with the invention at one head end with a suitably profiled extension 46 engaging a longitudinal groove of a corresponding beam. The frame parts 35, 36 are cut to the measures of the frame to be made by means of a single, straight sawcut so that a straight head face 45 is formed. After having cut a piece of a length corresponding to the thickness of the frame part concerned from the jambs, for example, the jamb 47 of the frame part 36 and after having inserted these jambs again into their longitudinal grooves, the frame parts can be simply assembled to a frame. As is shown in Fig. 8, the adjacent frame parts 35, 36 and 37, 38 are first slipped one into the other in the direction of the arrows 40 and subsequently these two half frames are joined in the direction of the arrows 41 to form the frame 42. By means of four beams embodying the invention a frame can thus be formed in a simple manner, which has fully effective carpenter s joints, whilst the operator need only have the skill of sawing a beam along a straight cut. The frame 50 shown in Fig. 9 is composed of frame parts having undercut, longitudinal grooves, for example, the threshold 52, the lintel 51, the posts 53 and the cross beam 54 with the aid of angular tie pieces, for example, the S L angular tie piece 55 shown in Fig. 11. The angular tie piece 55 has a first limb having a profile such that it fits in the longitudinal groove of the lintel 51. The second limb 59 of the angular tie piece 55 is in this embodiment also provided with a dovetail profile fitting in the longitudinal groove of the post 53. The limbs 58 and 59 of the angular tie piece 55 are fixedly secured to one another with the aid of a screw 60 and glue. To the limbs 58, 59 of the angular tie piece 55 are slipped jambs 57 and 56 in the undercut longitudinal grooves of the lintel 51 and the post 53 respectively.The limb 58 is prolonged beyond the limb 59 and protrudes into a part 61.This part 61 is fully received in the longitudinal groove of the lintel 51. Consequently the post 53 may have a straight sawcut at the top end. lVhen assembling the frame 50 to the frame parts, the angular tie pieces and the jambs are glued in the same manner as in the preceding embodiments. Fig. 9 shows that the cross beam 54 can be fastened by means of angular tie pieces in the longitudinal groove in the top side of said cross beam. If desired, further angular tie pieces may be arranged on the underside. In some cases it may be undesirable for the joint between a limb of an angular tie piece and the adjacent jamb to be visible as a seam. In this case the embodiments shown in Fig. 12 to 19 comprising covering laths may be employed. The frame 65 comprises a lintel 66, a threshold 67, posts 68, 69 and a cross beam 70. In the post 68 are milled a narrow groove 76 and a broad groove 77. In the groove 76 is glued on the bottom side a straight filling piece 73 shown in Fig. 15. The post 68 with the filler 73 glued therein is machined so that on the underside a dovetail shaped extension is formed. The post 68 is slipped with this dovetail shaped extension into the dovetail shaped groove of the threshold 67. This connection thus corresponds with the connections described with reference to the first embodiment. The post 69 is fastened in a similar manner in the threshold 67. In the post 69 is also glued a filling piece 74. The lintel 66 is provided on the underside with an undercut groove 78 as is shown in Fig. 18. For the connection of the post 68 with the lintel 66 an angular tie piece 75 is used, the upper limb of which has a dovetail shaped profile, as is shown in Fig. 17, whereas the lower limb has a rectangular cross section fitting in the recess formed by the groove 76 in the post 68. The post 69 is secured by means of a corresponding angular tie piece in the lintel 66. In the embodiment shown of the frame in accordance with the invention the cross beam 70 is held by means of an angular tie piece 72 in the post 68 and by means of a corresponding angular tie piece in the post 69. Since the cross beam 70 is locked in a vertical sense by the covering laths to be further described, having the function of jambs, and in a horizontal sense by the posts 68 and 69, the crossbeam 70 need not be fastened in the posts 68 and 69 by means of dovetail shaped or similar undercut groove joints. Fig. 14 shows that the two limbs of the angular tie piece 72 have rectangular sections. The horizontal limb 79 of the angular tie piece 72 is accommodated in the straight groove of the cross beam 70. The vertical limb 71 lies in the groove 76 of the post 68.As is shown, the angular tie piece 72 is designed so that in the mounted state it has the same height as the cross beam 70. Thus the cross beam 70 together with the angular tie piece 72 can be horizontally received in the post 68 without the need for further means. The connection of the cross beam 70 with the post 69 is established in a similar manner. It will be apparent from the Figures that the jambs 86 in the threshold 67 and 82 in the lintel 66 have the shape described above with the protruding dovetail profile. The jambs 80, 81 of the post 68, the jambs 83, 85 of the post 69 and the jamb 84 of the cross beam 70 are constructed so that they operate as covering laths for the angular tie pieces, for example, the angular tie piece 75 on the filling pieces 73, 74. These covering laths fall into the grooves in the frame parts concerned, for example, the groove 77 in the post 68. From the Figures and more particularly from Fig. 13 it will be apparent that the designs described provide a window frame, which does not differ in appearance from a professional frame made by conventional wood joints. However, it will be obvious that the frame embodying the invention can be made by a relatively unskilled person from ready made parts. Fig. 17 shows that the angular tie pieces are preferably provided with small grooves in the surfaces coming into contact with the frame parts. In this way an improved adhesion of the glue is obtained. The frame 65 shows a few different ways of interconnecting frame parts. It will be obvious that in accordance with the use of the frame embodying the invention other combinations of joints may be chosen.
