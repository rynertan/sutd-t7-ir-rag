# Arc welding method.

## Abstract
An arc welding method, which comprises arc welding objects of welding together along the line of a groove formed between said objects of welding by continuously moving a welding electrode along the line of said groove while reciprocating said welding electrode in the width direction of said groove characterized by calculating at prescribed time intervals, for each one reciprocation of said welding elec trode in the width direction of said groove, deviations I Io of values I of one of arc current and arc voltage from a previously set reference value Io , for each of left side deviations L and right side deviations R relative to the vertical plane which passes through the center of amplitude of said one reciprocation of said welding electrode and is parallel to the line of said groove calculating at said time intervals, when said welding electrode moves over the left side of said groove relative to said vertical plane, differences L R between said left side deviations L and the immedi ately preceding right side deviations R , to controllably aligning the center of said amplitude of said one reciproca tion of said welding electrode with the center of said groove in the width direction thereof at said prescribed time intervals so that said differences L R become null and, calculating at said prescribed time intervals, when said welding electrode moves over the right saide of said groove relative to said vertical plane, differences L R between said right side deviations R and the immediately preceding left side deviations L , to controllably aligning the center of said amplitude of said one reciprocation of said welding electrode with the center of said groove in the width direction thereof at said prescribed time intervals so that said differences L R become null.
