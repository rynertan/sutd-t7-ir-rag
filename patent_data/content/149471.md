# ROTARY VANE TYPE FLUID MACHINE

## Abstract
A rotary vane type fluid machine is constructed such that a rotor 1 is caused to rotate within a casing 2 to increase or decrease the volume of a space created between the outer periphery of the rotor 1 and the inner wall surface of the casing 2 by vane structures 8 which rotate together with the rotor 1 to thereby transfer a fluid by pressure in accordance with the variation in volume of said space. The vane structure 8 has two vanes disposed in substantially symmetrical relationship with respect to a shaft 6 of the rotor and fixed so that they can not moved relative to each other. The fluid machine also comprises a crank mechanism 3, 4, 3a, 4a which causes the vane structure 8 to radially advance the retreat in order to reciprocally vary a distance between a center of the shaft 6 and a tip end 7 of one vane and a distance between the center of the shaft 6 and a tip end 7 of the other vane in accordance with the rotation of the rotor 1 .
