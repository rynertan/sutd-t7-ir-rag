# Methods of and arrangements for decoding and recoding composite digital television signals.

## Abstract
A decoder recoder arrangement 1 for decoding a com posite digital television signal for recording on a digital video recorder 8 and for subsequently recoding the reproduced signal, the arrangement comprising a decoder 6 including filters 11, 15 and 16 for separating two chrominance compo nents from the composite digital television signal, demod ulators 17 and 18 for demodulating the chrominance com ponents, sample rate reducers 19 and 24 for reducing the sample rates of the demodulated chrominance components, interpolators 21 and 26 for interpolating samples into the sample reduced demodulated chrominance components to restore the sample rate to the original value,modulators 22 and 27 for remodulating the interpolated chrominance com ponents an adder 23 for adding together the modulated interpolated chrominance components, and a subtractor 13 for subtracting the output of the adder 23 from the input composite digital television signal and a recoder 7 includ ing interpolators 32 and 35 for interpolating samples into said sample reduced demodulated chrominance compo nents to restore the sample rate to the original sample value, modulators 33 and 36 for modulating the interpolated chrominance components obtained from the interpolators 32 and 35 , an adder 34 for adding together the outputs of the modulators 33 and 36 , and an adder 30 for adding the output of the adder 34 to the output of the subtractor 13 to derive the original composite digital television signal.
