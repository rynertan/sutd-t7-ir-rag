# Polyvalent metal ion chelating agents for xanthan solutions.

## Abstract
A stable xanthan solution with superior filterability charac teristics comprising biopolymer and a chelating agent selected from aliphatic alpha hydroxy acids having from 2 7 carbon atoms aliphatic and aromatic beta keto compounds having from 4 9 carbon atoms or 2 and 4 pyrones having a hydroxyl group alpha to the carbonyl and having 5 or 6 carbon atoms said chelating agent being present in an amount of at least 1.0 ppm of the total solution. A method of enhancing oil recovery comprising empolying as a mobility control solution in oil bearing formations a mixture of xanthan biopolymer and a chelating agent is also disclosed.
