# Electrical connector system.

## Abstract
Electrical connector system comprising a first connector frame 13 adjustable to a circuit board 1 , and a number of connector pins 12 , which are, arranged into a predetermined pattern, positioned into openings in the circuit board 1 and into openings in said first connector frame such, that the parts of said pins protruding from one side of said circuit board 1 are forming together with said first connector frame a first con nector and the parts of said pins protruding from the other side of said circuit board can first be used for attaching connecting leads, whereby the upper sections of said parts of the pins protruding from said other side of the circuit board are kept free during the attaching of said connecting leads and a sec ond connector frame 13 is positioned onto said free sections such, that said second connector frame 13 together with said free upper sections of said pins forms a second connector, which second connector frame is mounted by means of spacer elements 20 at a certain distance of the circuit board 1 and is connected to the first connector frame 3 by means of mounting pins 7 attached to both ends of said first connector frame 3 and running through suitable openings in said circuit board, through said spacer elements 20 and thereto in tended openings in the second connector frame 13 , which mounting pins 7 each have a hooked head 11 which hooked heads 11 are snapping behind the edges of the respective openings into the second connector frame 13 .
