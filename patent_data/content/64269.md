# Wheel bracket assembly.

## Abstract
A wheel bracket assembly includes an upper bracket having two spaced downwardly extending side flanges and a wheel carrying bracket pivotally supported between the upper bracket side flanges for pivotal movement about an axis. The second bracket has a generally horizontal top plate with a transverse, upwardly facing, concave groove and has side flanges which extend downwardly from opposite sides of the top plate and are adapted to pivotally support a wheel therebetween. Pivotal movement of the wheel carrying bracket in one direction is resisted by a resilient element which has one end engaging the top plate at a location within the groove, which extends away from such location approximately along the path of movement of the location about the pivot axis, which tapers in thickness toward such end, which has a semicylindrical head at the opposite end, and which has a transverse groove on each side thereof adjacent the head. An omega shaped clip securely grips around the head with its legs disposed in the transverse grooves, and has its ends securely supported on respective side flanges of the upper bracket. Progressive pivotal movement of the wheel carrying bracket is countered by progressively increasing resistance from the resilient element.

## Description
WHEEL BRACKET ASSEMBLY FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to an improvement in a bracket for rotatably supporting a wheel and, more particularly, to a wheel bracket assembly which is adapted to resiliently absorb shocks and impacts applied to the wheel. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Wheel carrying brackets are used in a variety of applications and are frequently subjected to punishing use. For example, wheel brackets used on shopping carts must support heavy loads of goods to be purchased, are repeatedly subjected to impacts and shocks from the curbs and rough pavement outside the store, and must endure extended exposure to rain, snow, sun and other elements. As a result, damage to the wheel, the wheel bearing and or the bracket is common. In order to reduce the damaging effect of such shocks, attempts have been made to incorporate a certain degree of resiliency into the wheel bracket assembly in order to damp or absorb the impact. Examples of such devices are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 1 745 992, 2 472 686 and 4 084 288. Although these devices have been adequate for their intended purposes, the character and performance of the resilient structure therein has not proved entirely satisfactory in all respects. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved wheel bracket assembly which is adapted to resiliently absorb impacts and shocks applied thereto, is durable and is virtually maintenance free. A further object of the present invention is to provide a wheel bracket assembly, as aforesaid, which is self leveling when moved over irregular surfaces but simultaneouslprovides a very stable support of the item it carries. A further object of the present invention is to provide a wheel bracket assembly, as aforesaid, having a resilient structure which offers progressively increasing resistance to progressively greater shock absorbing movement. A further object of the present invention is to provide a wheel bracket assembly, as aforesaid, which is adapted to shield the resilient structure from the elements and from damage by foreign objects. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The objects and purposes of the invention, including those set forth above, are met by providing a wheel bracket assembly which includes an upper bracket with spaced, downwardly extending side flanges and a wheel carrying bracket pivotally supported between the side flanges of the upper bracket for movement about a substantially horizontal axis. The wheel carrying bracket has a generally horizontal top plate and spaced side flanges which extend downwardly from opposite edges of the top plate and are adapted to pivotally support a wheel therebetween.A resilient element has one end supported on the upper bracket at a location above the wheel carrying bracket, extends from such location toward the wheel carrying bracket, has its opposite end in engagement with the top plate of the wheel carrying bracket, and gradually tapers in thickness toward the end which engages the wheel carrying bracket. Progressive pivotal movement of the wheel carrying bracket toward the resilient element is countered by progressively increasing resistance from the resilient element. In a preferred embodiment, the top plate of the wheel carrying bracket has a transverse, upwardly facing, concave groove and the resilient element engages the top plate within such groove. The resilient element extends away from the top plate approximately along the path of movement about the pivot axis of the surface area of the top plate engaged by the resilient element. The resilient element has a lateral width less than the lateral distance between the side flanges of the upper bracket, has a semicylindrical head at its end remote from the wheel carrying bracket, and has a concave transverse groove on each side adjacent the semicylindrical head. An omega shaped clip securely grips around the head of the resilient element and its legs engage the transverse grooves in the resilient element.The clip extends between and has its ends supported on the respective side flanges of the upper bracket.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Referring to Figures 1 and 2, a wheel bracket assembly 10 includes an upper bracket 16 having a substantially horizontal swivel plate 17, parallel side flanges 18 and 19 which extend downwardly from opposite lateral edges of the swivel plate 17, a front flange 21 which extends downwardly from the front edge of the swivel plate 17 and extends laterally between the side flanges 18 and 19, and a short rear flange 22 which extends downwardly from the rear edge of the swivel plate 17. A central vertical opening 23 is provided through the swivel plate 17 and the edges of the opening 23 are bent upwardly. A swivel mechanism 26 for pivotally mounting the wheel bracket assembly 10 to an item to be supported is disposed in the opening 23. The swivel mechanism 26 is of conventional construction and is substantially identical to that disclosed in detail in U.S. PatentNo. 3 142 085 or 4 219 903, both of which are assigned to the assignee of the present invention. Reference to these two patents is to be incorporated herein. Accordingly, the swivel mechanism 26 is not described here in detail, although a brief description is given for convenience. The swivel mechanism 26 has an upright, threaded kingpin 27 which is coaxially and rotatably disposed within the central opening 23 and has a diameter less than that of the central opening 23. More specifically, the kingpin 27 has a pair of radially outwardly extending bearing ball retainers 28 and 29 nonrotatably secured thereto. The retainer 28 is located above the swivel plate 17 and the retainer 29 is located below the swivel plate 17. The respective ends 31 and 32 of the retainers 28 and 29 are bent toward each other so as to define facing concave bearing races. A plurality of bearing balls 33 are disposed between the upturned edge of the central opening 23 and the race on the upper retainer 28. A plurality of bearing balls 34 are disposed in the upwardly facing concave race on the lower retainer 29 and engage the underside of the swivel plate 17. Each of the side flanges 18 and 19 of the upper bracket 16 has an opening 36 adjacent its lower end, only the opening 36 Figure 2 in flange 18 being illustrated in the drawings, which openings are forward of the axis of the kingpin 27, are coaxially aligned and are used for a purpose described hereinafter. A wheel carrying bracket 41 has a generally horizontal top plate 42 and two parallel side flanges 43 and 44 which extend downwardly from opposite sides of the top plate 42. A short front flange 46 extends downwardly from the forward end of the top plate 42 and interconnects the front part of the upper parts of each of the flanges 43 and 44. Each side flange 43 and 44 has an opening 47 in its upward forward portion, only the opening 47 Figure 2 in flange 43 being illustrated in the drawings, which openings are coaxially aligned.The wheel carrying bracket 41 is disposed between the side flanges 18 and 19 of the upper bracket 16 with the openings 47 coaxially aligned with the openings 36 in the upper bracket, and a substantially horizontal axle 49 securely mounted in the opening 36 extends through the openings47, thereby supporting the wheel carrying bracket for pivotal move ment with respect to the upper bracket. Each of the side flanges 43 and 44 of the wheel carrying bracket 41 has an opening 51 adjacent its lower end, which openings 51 are coaxially aligned and are adapted to support the axle of a wheel 53 carried by the wheel bracket assembly 10. The wheel 53 may be of any conventional type, does not form a part of the present invention, and is therefore illustrated only with broken lines. The top plate 42 of the wheel carrying bracket 41 has a transverse, upwardly facing, concave groove 54.Each side flange 18 and 19 of the upper bracket 16 has, slightly above the respective opening 36 or 37 therein,a respective opening 61 and 62 therethrough of substantially semicircular shape. The openings 61 and 62 are aligned with each other and each has, along its arcuate edge, a respective inwardly extending arcuate flange 63 and 64 Figure 4 . A resilient element 71 Figures 2, 4 and 5 is disposed between the side flanges 18 and 19 of the upper bracket 16 and between the swivel plate 17 of the upper bracket 16 and the top plate 42 of the wheel carrying bracket 41. The width of the resilient element 71 is less than the distance between the side flanges 17 and 18. The resilient element 71 has one end 72 in engagement with the upper surface of the top plate 42 at a location within the transverse groove 54. The resilient element 71 extends away from the top plate 42 approximately along the theoretical path of movement 73 around the axle 49 of the area of the top plate 42 which is engaged by the end 72 of the resilient element 71. This path of movement 73 lies along a circle concentric with the axle 49.The resilient element 71 has a transversely extending semicylindrical head 76 at its end remote from the end 72, and on each side has a transverse concave groove 77 adjacent the semicylindrical head 76, the shortest distance between the concave grooves 77 being less than the diameter of the semicylindrical head 76. The resilient element 71 has its maximum thickness at a location intermediate its ends and adjacent the grooves 77, and tapers gradually and uniformly in thickness therefrom toward end 72. An elongated omega shaped clip 81 securely grips around the semicylindrical head 76 of the resilient element 71 and the legs 82 of the clip 81 engage the grooves 77 on the resilient element 71. The general contour of the clip 81 is such that the entire inner surface of the clip 81 is in engagement with the surfaces of the head 76 and grooves 77 of the resilient element 71. This may be effected by forming the clip 81 to the desired shape prior to assembly, or by bending the clip 81 to its final shape as it is mounted on the head 76 of the resilient element 71 during assembly. In either case, the clip 81 preferably grips the resilient element 71 relatively tightly, and may even compress the resilient element 71 slightly. The radially outer surfaces 83 and 84 Figure 4 of the respective ends of the clip 81 are coaxial with and disposed against the respective radial inner surfaces of arcuate flanges 63 and 64 on side flanges 18 and 19 of the upper bracket 16. Each end of the clip 81 has a respective semicircular extension 91 and 92 which extends into a respective one of the semi circular openings 61 and 62 in the side flanges 18 and 19, the semicircular shape of the extensions 91 and 92 cooperating with the semicircular shape of the openings 61 and 62 to limit rotation of the clip 81 and resilient element 71 with respect to the upper bracket 16 about a horizontal axis. Rotation of the clip 81 is also limited by engagement of the legs 82 of the clip with the ends of the arcuate flanges 63 and 64.At each end of each extension 91 and 92 the clip 81 has respective outwardly facing shoulders 93 and 94 which engage the inner surfaces of the side flanges 18 and 19 to resist lateral movement of the clip 81 with respect to the upper bracket 16. The lower end 96 Figure 2 of the front flange 21 of the upper bracket 16 engages the forward portion of the top plate 42 of the wheel carrying bracket 41 to limit pivotal movement of the wheel carrying bracket 41 in a direction away from the resilient element 71. The resilient element 71 can be made from a number of suitable materials, but is preferably made from a polyurethane having a hardness in the range of 75 ShoreA to 55 Shore D Durometer. In practice, a hardness of 80 Shore A Durometer has proved satisfactory for most applications, with minor variations in the relative dimensions of the resilient element 71 being utilized to achieve desired performance characteristics for particular applications. OPERATION Although the operation of the wheel bracket assembly described above will be understood from the foregoing description by persons skilled in the art, a summary of such operation is now given for convenience. In normal use, the weight of the supported item will cause the wheel carrying bracket 41 to pivot slightly about the axis 49 and compress slightly the resilient element 71, so that the item is resiliently supported at all times. If, as the item is being moved, an irregularity in the floor or an obstruction is encountered by the wheel 53, the wheel carrying bracket 41 will pivot further about the axle 49, for example, from the position shown in solid lines inFigure 2 to the position shown in broken lines inFigure 2. The position of the axle 49 with respect to the axle of the wheel 53 is such that a relatively large vertical movement 98 Figure 2 of the wheel 53 is possible as it negotiates the obstacle without a substantial horizontal displacement 99. The shape and composition of the resilient element 71 is such that it offers progressively increasing resistance to progressively further pivotal movement of the wheel carrying bracket 41 about the axis 49. The swivel plate 17, side flanges 18 and 19, front flange 21 and rear flange 22 of the upper bracket 16 form a housing which substantially surrounds the resilient element 71 and protects it from exposure to the elements and from damaging contact with foreign objects. Although a particular preferred embodiment of the invention has been disclosed in detail for illustrative purposes, it will be recognized that variations or modifications of the disclosed apparatus, including the rearrangement of parts, lie within the scope of the present invention.
