## Description
This invention relates to novel macrocyclic compounds, and more specifically, to antibiotic YT 3927 having a 16 membered macrolide structure and its derivatives having excellent antibacterial activity. Many 16 membered macrolide antibiotics such as tylosin, carbomycin, leucomycin and rosamicin have been known. Tylosin is the oldest type of 16 membered macrolide antibiotics. Because tylosin has low absorbability and excretability in vivo despite its high antibacterial activity in vitro, investigatios have been actively undertaken in the art for producing tylosin derivatives having excellent absorbability and excretability by chemical or biological converting methods. It is well known that Streptomyces fradiaeNRRL B 2702 strain produces tylosin see, for example, Antibiot. Chemoth., Vol. 11, Pages 328 334, 1961 . From quite a different standpoint from prior works, the present inventors hit upon an idea of mutating the aforesaid Streptomyces fradiae NRRL B 2702, a tylosinproducing microorganism, under various conditions in order to search for novel analogs of tylosin. Subsequent investigations based on this idea showed that when theStreptomyces fradiae NRRL B 2702 is mutated by usingN methyl N nitro N nitrosoguanidine as a mutagenic agent and the resulting novel mutant, Streptomyces fradiaeYT 3927, is cultivated in a nutrient medium, a novel tylosin analog of the following formula EMI2.1 resulting from the substitution of a hydrogen atom for the mycinose residue bonded to the carbon atom at the 23position in the carbon numbering of tylosin can be obtained from the culture broth, and that this compound exhibits broad and strong antibacterial activity against various pathogenic microorganisms such as Gram positive bacteria,Gram negative bacteria, and mycoplasmas. They named this compound antibiotic YT 3927 . The antibiotic YT 3927 provided by this invention has a 16 membered macrolide structure as is seen from the above formula I a , and is characterized by the bonding of a methyl group at its 14 position. This compound has physicochemical properties shown below. 1 Appearance white crystals 2 Melting point 164.5 168 C 3 Specific rotation D5 6.6 c 2, methanol 4 Elemental analysis for C38H63N012 C H N Calculated 62.87 8.75 1.93 Found 63.03 8.80 1.84 5 Ultraviolet absorption spectrum methanol 283 nm E1 1 cm 300 max 6 Infrared absorption spectrum The main characteristic absorption peaks wave numbers of the infrared spectrum measured by the potassium bromide tablet method are as follows 3470, 2980, 2940, 2720, 1725, 1685, 1600 cm 7 Proton NMR spectrum The characteristic signals of the proton NMR spectrum in deuterochloroform at 100 MHz and their assignments are as follows tetramethylsilane is used as an internal reference .EMI3.1 tb SEP Number SEP of tb 6 SEP ppm SEP protons SEP Form SEP J SEP Hz SEP Assignment tb SEP 0.95 SEP 3 SEP t SEP J16,17 SEP 7.0 SEP 17 CH3 SEP tb SEP 1.09 SEP 3 SEP d SEP J14,23 SEP 6.8 SEP 23 CH3 tb SEP 1.81 SEP 3 SEP s SEP 22 CH3 tb SEP 2.49 SEP 6 SEP s SEP N CH3 2 tb SEP J2A,3 SEP 10 tb SEP 3.84 SEP 1 SEP broad SEP d SEP J3,4 SEP about SEP 1 2 SEP 3 H tb SEP 2B,3 SEP about SEP 1 2 tb SEP 4.08 SEP 1 SEP qd SEP SEP 5,0 SEP SEP 6.0 SEP 5 H tb SEP J4 ,5 SEP 9.6 SEP tb SEP 4.23 SEP 1 SEP d SEP J1 ,2 SEP SEP 7.4 SEP 1 H tb SEP J14,15 SEP 9.5 tb SEP 4.73 SEP 1 SEP ddd SEP J15,16A 3.0 SEP 15 H tb SEP J15,16B 9.0 tb SEP 5.08 SEP 1 SEP broad SEP d SEP J1 ,2 A 3.0 SEP 1 H tb SEP J1 ,2 B about SEP 0.5 tb SEP 5.67 SEP 1 SEP d SEP J13,14 10.5 SEP 13 H tb SEP 6.28 SEP 1 SEP d SEP J10,11 15.3 SEP 10 H tb SEP 7.27 SEP 1 SEP d SEP J11,12 15.3 SEP 11 H SEP tb SEP 9.67 SEP 1 SEP d SEP CHO tb 8 Molecular weight and molecular formula The molecular weight of the antibiotic YT 3927 is 725 when determined by an electron impact mass spectrum.The molecular formula is C38H63N012. 9 Solubility Soluble in lower alcohol such as methanol and ethanol, esters such as ethyl acetate and. butyl acetate, ketones such as acetone and methyl isobutyl ketone, benzene, toluene, chloroform, and weakly acidic water, and insoluble in weakly alkaline water, petroleum ether, n hexane and cyclohexane. 10 Stability Stable even when left to stand at room temperature for one month. 11 Color reactions Positive in the Molisch reaction, anthrone reaction and conc. sulfuric acid reaction, and negative in the burette reaction, ninhydrin reaction and Sakaguchi reaction. 12 C13 NMR spectrum The C13 NMR spectrum in deuterochloroform at 25.2 MHz is shown in Figure 1 attached internal reference tetramethyl silane .

The microorganism having the ability to produce the antibiotic YT 3927 used in this process may be those belonging to any genus so long as they have the ability to produce the antibiotic YT 3927 having the physicochemical properties given hereinabove. Generally, microorganisms of the genus Streptomyces which have the ability to produce the antibiotic YT 3927, particularly Streptomyces fradiae YT 3927, which is a new mutant of Streptomyces fradiae NRRL B 2702 having the ability to produce tylosin, can be advantageously used. The new mutant Streptomyces fradiae YT 3927 can be produced by mutating the parent strain Streptomyces fradiae NRRL B 2702 with N methyl N nitro N nitrosoguanidine as a mutagenic agent in a customary manner.In the present invention, not only the above new mutant, but also other microorganisms such as Streptomyces fradiaeNRRL B 2702 to which the ability to produce the antibioticYT 3927 has been imparted by ordinary microorganism species improving methods, for example mutating means using chemicals other than the aforesaid mutagenic agents, ultraviolet light, radiation, etc., or gene manipulating means such as conjugation, transformation, transduction and cell fusion can be used in this invention. The Streptomyces fradiae YT 3927 having the ability to produce the antibiotic YT 3927 has the following microbiological properties. 1 Morphology In an inorganic salt starch agar medium at 30 0C for 14 days , the spore.chain at the ends of well branched aerial mycelia looks like a hook, loop or irregular coil Retinaculiariti section .

The Streptomyces fradiae YT 3927 is deposited under FERM P 5758, FERM BP 12 in Fermentation ResearchInstitute of Agency of Industrial Science and Technology,Japan at 1 1 3 Higashi, Yatabe cho, Tsukuba gun, Ibarakiken, Japan. Cultivation of the above strain capable of producing the antibiotic YT 3927 can be carried out by inoculating it in a nutrient medium, and cultivating it by a known method of cultivating actinomycetes. Conventional carbon sources, nitrogen sources, inorganic salts, etc. used for cultivation of actinomycetes can be used as nutrient sources to be included in the culture medium. Examples of the carbon sources are glucose, starch, maltose, glycerol, soybean oil, colza oil used either singly or in combination. The nitrogen sources include organic nitrogen sources such as meat extract, fish meal, peptone, dried yeasts, yeast extracts, wheat germ, soybean flour, gluten meal and cottonseed residues and inorganic nitrogen sources such as ammonium sulfate, sodium nitrate and urea. If desired, inorganic salts such as sodium chloride, calcium carbonate, phosphates and magnesium sulfate may be added. Furthermore, it is possible to add organic or inorganic materials which promote the growth of the microorganism or the production of the antibiotic YT 3927. The cultivation of the strain capable of producing the antibiotic YT 3927 in such a nutrient medium can be carried out in accordance with conventional methods used in the production of antibiotics by general actinomycetes.Generally, it is preferred to perform the cultivation under aerobic conditions. Usually, it can be performed with stirring and aeration. The method of cultivation may be stationary, shaken or submerged with agitation and aeration. Submerged cultivation, especially submerged cultivation with agitation under aerobic conditions, is preferred. The cultivation temperature may be any temperature which does not substantially inhibit the growth of the antibiotic YT 3927 producing microorganisms and can give the antibiotic YT 3927. Generally, the suitable cultivation temperature is 20 to 400C, preferably 25 to 350C. The pH of the culture medium is generally k. 5 to 8.5, preferably about 6 to about 8. In the case of large scale cultivation, it is advantageous to prepare a seed culture, inoculate it in a nutrient medium, and then cultivate it in a submerged condition. The cultivation can usually be continued until the antibiotic YT 3927 is fully accumulated in the culture medium. The cultivation time varies depending upon the composition of the culture medium, the cultivation temperature, the microorganism strain used, etc. In submerged cultivation, it is 2 to 12 days. The amount of the antibiotic YT 3927 accumulated in the culture medium can be determined by usual methods, for exmple by bioassay or chromatography using sensitive microorganisms. The optimum amount of the antibiotic accumulated can be easily determined by this method. The antibiotic YT 3927 is recovered and isolated when the amount of accumulation reaches its maximum. Since the antibiotic YT 3927 is a basic macrolide antibiotic, the recovery and isolation of the antibioticYT 3927 can be performed by methods normally used for the purification and isolation of basic macrolide antibiotics, for example by an extraction method based on the utilization of the differences in solubility in suitable solvents, and a fractionating method based on the differences in the utilization of adsorptive and affinitive power for adsorbents, etc. Such methods may be used in suitable combinations, or repeated. One specific examples of recovery of the antibiotic YT 3927 from the culture broth and its purification is shown below. The culture broth is made weakly alkaline with sodium hydroxide or the like, and extracted with a solvent such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, chloroform, benzene or toluene. The solvent layer was separated, and an acidic aqueous solution such as a 1 5 M sodium acetate HCl buffer, is added. The mixture is transferred to the aqueous layer. The aqueous layer is then made weakly alkaline with sodium hydroxide or the like, and extracted with a solvent such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, chloroform, benzene or toluene. The solvent layer is separated, and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure. The resulting pale yellow white powder is then chromatographed on a silica gel column using a mixed solvent such as benzene acetone and benzene methanol as an eluent.Fractions containing the antibiotic YT 3927 are collected, concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure, dissolved in ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, chloroform, benzene, toluene, etc., and transferred into acidified water.Then, the water layer is neutralized with alkali, and the product is extracted with the same solvents as described before. The solvent layer is concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure to give a pure white powder of the antibiotic YT 3927. The antibiotic YT 3927 in the above process can be assayed by developing it with a 2 1 mixture of acetone and benzene by the ascending method using a silica gel thin layer chromatographic plate SILICA GEL 60 F254, a product of Merck Co. , and measuring the UV absorption value at 283 nm by a chromatographic scanner Model CS 910, a product of Shimadzu Seisakusho Co., Ltd. . The antibiotic YT 3927 has an Rf value of 0.19. B Compounds of formula I b in which R2 is a hydrogen atom can be produced by reacting a compound of the following formula EMI23.1 wherein B1 represents a protective group for a hydroxyl group, and R1 is as defined above, or its salt, with a reactive derivative of an acid represented by the following formula R3 Y OH wherein R3 is as defined above, to introduce the group R3 Y into the hydroxyl group at the 4 position of the compound of formula II , and thereafter, splitting off the protective group B1. Introduction of the R3 Y group can be carried out by known acylation methods. For example, the reaction is carried out in the absence of a solvent or in the presence of a suitable inert solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform, acetone, benzene, toluene, tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile. The reaction can be carried out generally at about 30 C to the refluxing temperature of the reaction mixture, preforably at about 20 C to 600C. However, when the starting material is a compound of formula II in which R1 is hydrogen and the acylation of the hydroxyl group at the 3 position is not desired, it is desirable to use relatively mild acylating conditions, i.e. temperatures of approximately up to room temperature. Examples of the reactive derivatives of the acid of formula III used as the acylating agent in the above reaction are acid halides particularly, chlorides , acid anhydrides, and mixed acid anhydrides e.g., anhydrides of the acid of formula III and pivalic acid . The amount of the reactive derivative of the acid III is not strictly restricted. Generally, it is 1 to 50 moles, preferably 2 to 20 moles, per mole of the compound of formula II . When the reactive derivative of a lower alkanoic acid is used as the acylating agent to acylate a compound of formula II in which R1 is a hydrogen atom, it is possible to produce a compound of formula I b in whichR1 and R3 Y are lower alkanoyl groups by simultaneously acylating the hydroxyl group at the 4 position and the hydroxyl group at the 3 position. Conveniently, this simultaneous acylation is carried out at a relatively high temperature of about 20 to about 30 C by using the acylating agent in an amount of 5 to 50 moles, preferably 10 to 20 moles, per mole of the compound of formula II . As required, the acylating reaction may be carried out in the presence of an acid binder. Examples of acid binders are organic bases such as pyridine, collidine, N methylpiperidine, triethylamine and dimethylaniline. The acid binder may bemused in an amount of 2 to 50 equivalents, preferably 2 to 30 equivalents, per mole of the compound of formula II . A liquid organic base such as pyridine may be used concurrently as a solvent by using it in excess. Removal of the protective group B1 from the acylated product can be effected by a method known per se.For example, it may be carried out by dissolving the product in a lower alcohol such as methanol or ethanol, or a hydrous organic solvent, or adding ammonia or an alkali to a hydrous organic solvent having the aforesaid product dissolved or dispersed therein, and treating it at a temperature ranging from room temperature to the boiling point of the solvent for 5 hours to 24 hours. The resulting compound of formula I b in which R2 is hydrogen can be separated from the reaction mixture and or purified by a method known per se, for example by pouring the reaction mixture into a solvent such as benzene, toluene, or ethyl acetate, washing it with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate in a customary manner, and removing the solvent under reduced pressure, and if further required, subjecting it to column chromatography. The compounds of formula II used as a starting material in the aforesaid acylating reaction are novel compounds not described in the prior literature. Compounds of formula II in which R1 is a hydrogen atom can be produced by introducing a protective group into the hydroxyl group at the 2 position of the antibiotic YT 3927 of formula I a or its salt by a method known per se.The protective group B1 for the hydroxyl group may be a group which can be easily split off by hydrolysis. Examples include acyl groups such as acetyl, monochloroacetyl, trichloroacetyl and propionyl, and acyloxy groups such as butyloxycarbonyl, tert butyloxycarbonyl or b enzyloxycarbonyl. C Compounds of formula II in which R1 is a lower alkanoyl group can be produced by acylating the antibioticYT 3927 of formula I a by an enzymatic method to introduce a lower alkanoyl group selectively into the 3 position, and then introducing a hydroxyl protecting group into the 2 position. The enzymatic method used for selective acylation of the antibiotic YT 3927 is known per se, and is disclosed, for example, in J. Ferment.Technol., Vol. 57, No. 6, pages 519 528 1979 . D Compounds of formula I b in which R2 is a lower alkanoyl can be produced by reacting a compound of the following formula EMI26.1 wherein B1 is as defined above R 2 represents a lower alkanoyl group B2 represents a lower alkanoyl group and B3 and B4 represent an acetal residue, or when B3 represents a lower alkanoyloxy group, B2 and B4 may together form a direct bond, with an anhydride or mixed anhydride for example, a mixed acid anhydride of the following acid and pivalic acid of an acid of the following formula R3 Y OH III wherein R3 and Y are as defined above, in benzene in the presence of 4 dimethylaminopyridine under reflux at a temperature of about 70 to about 900C to perform transfer of the lower alkanoyl group R2 at the 4 position to the 3 position and the introduction of the group R3 Y into the 4 position, and thereafter removing the protective group. The amount of 4 dimethylaminopyridine used as a catalyst in the above raction is generally 0.1 to 10 moles, preferably 1 to 2 moles, per mole of the compound of formula IV . The anhydride or mixed anhydride of an acid of formula III as an acylating agent for the 4 position is conveniently used in an amount of generally 10 to 50 moles, preferably 30 to 40 moles, per mole of the compound of formula IV . As a result of the above reaction, the transfer of the lower alkanoyl group R2 at the 4 position to the hydroxyl group at the 3 position and the introduction of the group R3 Y into the 4 position take place to give compounds of the following formulaEMI27.1 wherein R2, R3, B1, B2, B3 and B4 are as defined hereinabove. Subsequent selective hydrolysis of the compound of formula V can give compounds of formula I b in whichR2 is a lower alkanoyl group. The compound of formula IV used as a starting material in the aforesaid method can be produced by acetalizing the aldehyde at the 20 position of a compound of the following formulaEMI27.2 wherein R1, R 2 and B1 are as defined above, obtained by the aforesaid acylating reaction, or when is a hydrogen atom, reacting such a compound with a lower alkanoic acid anhydride in the presence of an alkali carbonate. The compounds of formula I prepared by the above processes can be converted by methods known per se into acid addition salts by treatment with hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, propionic acid, citric acid, and so on The compounds of formula I and their salts provided by this invention have excellent antibacterial activity against various pathogenic microorganisms such as Gram positive bacteria, Gram negative bacteria and mycoplasmas, and exhibit high bioavailability.
