Following conventional chemical nomenclature, the two forms of a particular compound are designated as the E and the Z isomers of the compound. Referring to compound no. 1 ofTable I, the E and Z forms are shown below by way of example.EMI4.1 tb SEP F SEP C1 tb SEP NH SEP JNH SEP Cl tb g SEP SEP C SEP 4 tb SEP II tb SEP F SEP O tb SEP C,H,O SEP Z SEP form tb SEP 2 SEP 2 tb E formEMI4.2 In Table I, compounds 1 and 2 have the same molecular formula. Compound 1 is a mixture of E and Z forms in the ratio shown and compound Z is the pure Z isomer. Depending upon the process chosen for preparing a particular compound, or on the way in which the conditions for a particular process are varied, either of the E and Z forms may be obtained, or a mixture of the two. The isomers, having different physical properties, may be separated by physical processes known in the chemical art.Both isomers of a particular compound have biological activity, but the biological effects of the isomers may not be completely identical in every case. The compounds in Table I are mixtures of E and Z forms unless otherwise specified. The compounds of formula I may be used to combat and control infestations of insect pests particularly lepidopterous and coleopterous insects. The insect pests which may be combated and controlled by the use of the invention compounds include those pests associated with agriculture which term includes the growing of crops for food and fibre products, horticulture and animal husbandry , forestry, the storage of products of vegetable origin, such as fruit, grain timber, and also those pests associated with the transmission of diseases of man and animals. Thus the compounds may be used to control mosquito larvae and the larvae of the common housefly.The compounds may also be effective in controlling infestations of Coleoptera and Diptera by causing the laying of infertile eggs. In order to apply the compounds to the locus of the pests they are usually formulated into compositions which include in addition to the insecticidally active ingredient or ingredients of formula I suitable inert diluent or carrier materials, and or surface active agents. The compositions may also comprise another pesticidal material, for example another insecticide or acaricide, or a fungicide, or may also comprise a insecticide synergist, such as for example dodecyl imidazole, safroxan, or piperonyl butoxide. The compositions may be in the form of dusting powders wherein the active ingredient is mixed with a solid diluent or carrier, for example kaolin, bentonite, kieselguhr, or talc, or they may be in the form of granules, wherein the active ingredient is absorbed in a porous granular material for example pumice. Alternatively the compositions may be in the form of liquid preparations to be used as dips or sprays, which are generally aqueous dispersions or emulsions of the active ingredient in the presence of one or more known wetting agents, dispersing agents or emulsifying agents surface active agents . Wetting agents, dispersing agents and emulsifying agents may be of the cationic, anionic or non ionic type.Suitable agents of the cationic type include, for example, quaternary ammonium compounds, for example, cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide. Suitable agents of the anionic type include, for example, soaps, salts of aliphatic monoesters or sulphuric acid, for example sodium lauryl sulphate, salts of sulphonated aromatic compounds, for example sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate, sodium, calcium or ammonium lignosulphonate, butylnaphthalene sulphonate, and a mixture of the sodium salts of diisopropyl and triisopropylnaphthalene sulphonates. Suitable agents of the non ionic type include for example, the condensation products of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols such as oleyl alcohol or cetyl alcohol, or with alkyl phenols such as octyl phenol, nonyl phenol and octyl cresol.Other non ionic agents are the partial esters derived from long chain fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, the condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, and the lecithins. The compositions may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient in a suitable solvent, for example, a ketonic solvent such as diacetone alcohol, or an aromatic solvent such as trimethylbenzene and adding the mixture so obtained to water which may contain one or more known wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agents. Other suitable organic solvents are dimethyl formamide, ethylene dichloride, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol and other glycols, diacetone alcohol, toluene, kerosene, white oil, methylnaphthalene, xylenes and trichloroethylene, N methyl 2 pyrrolidone and tetrahydro furfuryl alcohol THFA . The compositions to be used as sprays may also be in the form of aerosols wherein the formulation is held in a container under pressure in the presence of a propellant such as fluorotrichloromethane or dichlorodifluoromethane.The compositions which are to be used in the form of aqueous dispersions or. emulsions are generally supplied in the form of a concentr.ate containing a high proportion of the active ingredient or ingredients, the said concentrate to be diluted with water before use. These concentrates are often required to withstand storage for prolonged periods and after such storage, to be capable of dilution with water to form aqueous preparations which remain homogeneous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional spray equipment. The concentrates may contain 10 858 by weight of the active ingredient or ingredients. When diluted to form aqueous preparations, such preparations may contain varying amounts of the active ingredient depending upon the purpose for which they are to be used. For agricultural or horticultural purposes, an aqueous preparation containing between 0.0001 and 0.1 by weight of the active ingredient is particularly useful. In use the compositions are applied to the pests, to the locus of the pests, to the habitat of the pests, or to growing plants liable to infestation by the pests, by any of the known means of applying pesticidal compositions, for example, by dusting or spraying. The rate of application will depend upon factors such as the insect species to be controlled but in general a rate of from 5 to 1000g per hectare will be appropriate. The compositions of the invention are very toxic to a variety of insect pests, including, for example, the following Plutella maculipennis diamond back moth, larvae Phaedon cochleariae mustard beetle Trialeuroides spp. white flies Spodoptera littoralis cotton leaf worm Compounds of the invention wherein the group R2 is an Is alkenyloxy, alkoxy, or phenoxy group may be prepared by reacting a l,3,5 oxadiazine derivative 11 with the appropriate alkenol, alkanol, or phenol. The reaction is illustrated below for the case where the alkanol is ethanol. EMI8.1 Compounds according to the invention wherein the group R2 ia an alkylthio or phenylthio group may be prepared in the same way by reacting the appropriate 1,3,5 oxadiazine derivative II with the appropriate alkanethiol or thiophenol. Compounds according to the invention in which the group R2 is an aminci group or an amino group substituted by one or two alkyl groups may be prepared by reacting the appropriate 1,3,5 oxadiazine II with ammonia or with the appropriate mono or di alkylamine. The 1,3,5 oxadiazine derivatives II may be prepared as described in German Offenlegungschrift no. 2732115. The reaction with the alkenol, alkanol, phenol, alkanethiol, thiophenol, ammonia, or amine may if desired be carried out in a solvent inert to the reactants. It may be convenient to carry out the reaction by treating the oxadiazine with an excess of the other reactant as the solvent. The reaction may if desired be accelerated by heating. In an alternative method of preparation, compounds in which R2 is an alkoxy or alkenyloxy group may be prepared by the reaction scheme outlined below EMI8.2 In this scheme, the imidate ester III , wherein R1 is an alkenyloxy, or alkoxy group, is reacted with the appropriate isocyanate R2NCO to give the compounds of the invention.The imidate esters and the isocyanates R2NCO may be prepared by standard methods well known in the chemical art. Compounds wherein the group R1 is an alkylthio group may also be prepared by the last foregoing reaction scheme. The invention is illustrated by the followingExamples in which all the parts are by weight and all temperatures in degrees Centigrade unless otherwise specified. EXAMPLE 1 This Example illustrates the preparation of compound no. 20 of Table I. a Preparation of ethyl 2,6 difluorobenzimidate 2,6 Difluorobenzamide 1.56g in methylene chloride was added to triethyloxonium fluoborate 1.9g in methylene chloride and the mixture stirred for 24 hours. The solution was then washed three times with cold sodium carbonate solution and dried over sodium sulphate. The methylene chloride solution was evaporated to yield an oil. This was mixed with chloroform and the solution filtered from insoluble material. Evaporation of the chloroform gave the ethyl 2,6 difluorobenzimidate as a mobile oil. b Preparation of compound no. 20 The product from paragraph a above 0.33g in dry ether was added slowly to a stirred solution of 4 chloro3 trifluoromethylphenyl isocyanate 0.28g in dry ether.The mixture was stirred for several hours and then left at room temperature for 3 days. The solvent was then removed and the residue recrystallised from hexane to give compound no. 20 with a melting point of 1090C. EXAMPLE 2 This Example illustrates the preparation of compound no. 2 of Table I i.e. the pure Z isomer of compound no.1 . 3 3, 4 Dichlorophenyl 6 2, 6 difluorophenyl 3,4 dihydro 2 H 1,3,5 oxadiazin 2,4 dione 0.6g prepared as described in Example 3 of West German Offenlegungschrift no. 2732115, was heated under reflux with ethanol 15 ml for 2 hours, when all the solid had dissolved. Water was then added until the solution became slightly turbid and the solution left to stand. The crystals which separated were collected and identified as compound no. 2, having a melting point of 96 C. The nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of the product was in agreement with the structure assigned. EXAMPLE 3 This Example illustrates the insecticidal activity of compounds according to the invention. The compounds of the invention were formulated for test by dissolving a sample of each compound in the minimum amount of a mixture of 1 part by volume of ethyl alcohol and 1 part by volume of acetone, and then diluting the solution so obtained with water to give a solution having a concentration of 1000 parts per million.These solutions were then used in tests on mustard beetle Phaedon cochleariae and cotton leaf worm Spodoptera littoralis . These tests were carried out as followsMustard Beetle Pots containing mustard cotyledons are sprayed to runoff with the spray solution described above. When dry the sprayed foliage is fed to mustard beetle larvae 4th instar stage kept in Petri dishes containing filter paper 10 larvae per dish . After 48 hours the filter paper is changed and the dead larvae counted. The larvae are fed again with a single unsprayed leaf and further mortality counts made at 6 and 12 days.Cotton Leaf Worm Test The test is similar to that described for the mustard beetle above, with the following differencesCabbages are used as the test plants and 5 larvae instead of 10 are used. Mortality counts are mae at 48 hours at which stage the filter paper is removed and the larvae fed on an untreated artificial diet. A further count is made at 6 days. Two replicates are used in all tests. The results are given below in Table II. In the Table, the results given are expressed on a scale of O two 3, corresponding to the following ranges of percentage kill Scale Figure Percentage Kill o Less than 30 1 30 49 2 50 90 3 90 100 A dash means that no test was carried out.
