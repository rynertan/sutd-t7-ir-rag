# ROOM TEMPERATURE METAL VAPOUR LASER

## Abstract
A metal vapour laser 10 is disclosed having an optical cavity 12 with a sputtering cathode and anode 18 located at one end of the cavity. The sputtering cathode and anode includes a gaseous jet inlet 40, 34 to introduce a gas stream of inert gas into the optical cavity for entraining metal vapour sputtered by the sputtering cathode and anode 18 . An electrical discharge 55 separate to the sputtering cathode and anode is provided in the optical cavity for exciting the metal vapour entrained in the inert gas stream.
