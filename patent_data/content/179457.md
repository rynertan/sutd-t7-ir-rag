# Ink dot printer.

## Abstract
An ink dot printer which comprises at least one needle 44 located in one side of a recording paper 18 and capable of being displaced between a normal position and a projected position, and drive mechanism 30 for moving the needle between the two positions, and in which ink is attached to the tip 100 of the needle when the needle is at the normal position, and ink is caused to be removed from the tip to form an ink dot on the paper when the needle is at the projected position, is characterized in that the needle is made of an electrically conductive material, and the ink dot printer further comprises an electrode 80 disposed on another side of the paper and facing the tip, and electric field generating mechanism 96 for generating, between the electrode and needle, an electric field having such an intensity as to cause ink to fly from the tip, when the needle closer to the paper than the normal position, to form an ink dot on the paper.
