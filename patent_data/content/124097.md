# Method for storing and retrieving data in a data base.

## Abstract
A method for fast storing large amounts of data in a data base and for fast retrieving data in that base using inverted lists, without substantially increasing the storage space over that of the original data base and without sacrificing on data amenable of fast searching, is disclosed. The method allows for very efficient storage of the invert ed lists. The inverted lists require much less storage space than the original data base and allows users to maintain invert ed lists for all fields in the data base. The data base comprises a self descriptive index key for mat having variable length data fields so that the data base sys tem manipulation is independent of the type and arrangement of the data being stored and retrieved. The data is character ized by three index variables which represent the data table, the record in that table, and a particular field within that record. Each table is composed of data imbedded in the B tree index structure of the data base. In order to access records using the field variables, the data base edditionally includes an inverted B tree index logical ly related to the original index. The operation of the index may be enhanced by the use of date compression and the use of a sparse array bit map to represent the record associated with each filed.
