# DOOR STOP

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a mechanism for restricting the extent to which a closure member for an access aperture into a structure can be moved from a fully closed position to an open position via a pre determined partially open position at which further opening of the closure member can be impeded by the said mechanism, the mechanism being adapted to be mounted internally of the structure and adjacent the head and or foot of said aperture, said mechanism comprising a stop member adapted to be mounted on or to engage with the head and or foot of the closure member and a guide member adapted to co operate with the said stop member which guide member is adapted to guide the travel of the stop member between an operative position at which the mechanism acts to impede further opening of the closure member beyond the said pre determined partially open position and an inoperative position in which the mechanism does not impede the opening or closing of the closure member, said travel passing through an intermediate position at which the closure member must be substantially in the fully closed position to permit the passage of the stop member to enable it to travel from its operative position to its inoperative position the said guide member being adapted to be mounted adjacent said aperture so that at least that part thereof co operating with the said stop member is located below the lower or above the upper extremity of said closure member.
