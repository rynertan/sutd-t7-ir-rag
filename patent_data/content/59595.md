# Steering lock assembly.

## Abstract
The assembly is provided for locking and unlocking a steering shaft by use of a key 2 . The rotation of the rotor 3 through key manipulation is controlled by a knob 15 provided behind the steering lock assembly with a spacing such as to prevent one handed operation of the knob 15 and key 2 simultaneously. Only when the knob 15 is depressed, control means 11, 13 , permits the rotor 3 to rotate from an unlock position to a lock position.
