# A method of assembling a filter press type electrolytic cell.

## Abstract
A method of assembling an electrolytic cell of the filter press type comprising a plurality of anodes, cathodes, gaskets of an electrically insulating material, and separators, in which the electrolytic cell is assembled on a jig comprising a support unit having removably affixed thereto a plurality of substan tially horizontally disposed support members 20, 21 positio ned to at least one side of said unit, and preferably to both sides of said unit, the method comprising positioning anodes 1 , cathodes 33 and gaskets 8, 9 on said horizontally dispo sed support members 20, 21 with a separator positioned between an adjacent anode 1 and cathode 33 removing the support unit, and compressing the thus formed assembly of anodes 1 , cathodes 33 , gaskets 8, 9 and separators on the horizontally disposed support members 20, 21 to form the electrolytic cell.
