# Floating head slider.

## Abstract
A floating head slider is described for transducing informa tion upon a magnetic recording surface during relative movement between the magnetic head and the recording surface. The magnetic slider 1c has a body 4 including three depending, longitudinally extending elements 3, 3 , 6 having bottom sur faces that are laterally spaced apart. The bottom surfaces of at least the two outside elements 3, 3 , 6 each form an air bearing surface, and at the air inflow end and air outflow end of each surface a pressure raising mechanism 15,16 is formed a magnetic head aligned with the centre element 6 . In another embodiment a pressure reducing mechanism is formed at the middle of each air bearing surface.
