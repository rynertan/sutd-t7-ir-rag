# DAMAGE RESISTANT HEAT EXCHANGER

## Abstract
A damage resistant radiator, typically for i.c. engines in land vehicles, has heat exchange tubes extending between header tanks, said tubes being surrounded by a secondary heat exchange surface. The row of tubes adjacent the radiator face where impingement damage is anticipated is arranged so that the tubes are isolated from the route of the cooling fluid through the radiator. Alternatively the tubes in this row are replaced by solid rods.
