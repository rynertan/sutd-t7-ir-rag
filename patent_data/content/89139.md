The hydrolysis must of course be carried out under conditions to which the groups on the rest of the molecule are stable. For the preparation of a compound of formula II in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable ester, it is convenient to employ a compound of formula IV wherein the desired ester group is present. The preparation of the compounds of the formula IV may be effected by the reaction of a coipound of the formula V EMI11.1 wherein R1, R2, R4, R5, and R6 are as defined in relation to formula IV and R7 is an esterifying group with a di C1,6 alkylphosphorochloridate or thionyl chloride and a tri C1 6 alkylamine followed by reaction with a derivative of the formula VI L0 0SR3 VI wherein L is a lithium, sodium, silver or thallium I cation or an ammonium ion substituted by up to three C16 alkyl groups, and R3 is as hereinbefore defined.

The ester of the compound of the formula IX may be prepared from the corresponding ester of the carbinol of the formula X EMI14.1 wherein R2 and R7 are as hereinbefore described, by reaction with thionyl chloride. This reaction is also normally effected in the presence of at least one equivalent of a base of relatively low nucleophilicity in a dry solvent such as dioxan or tetrahydrofuran but in this instance the reaction is performed at a depressed temperature, for example 300 to 100C. The ester of the preceding carbinol may be prepared by the reaction of the compound of the formula XI EMI15.1 wherein R2 is as hereinbefore defined, with a glyoxylic acid ester. Normally this reaction is carried out in an inert solvent at an elevated temperature, for example, in dry benzene under reflux. The esters of the compounds of the formula X may also be prepared by esterification of a salt of the compound of the formula X in conventional manner. Suitable methods include the reaction of alkali metal salt such as a sodium or potassium salt with a reactive halide or sulphonate ester such as a bromide, chloride, mesylate, tosylate or the like. Such esterifications may be carried out under conventional conditions, for example in dimethylformamide at room temperature. The salt of compound of the formula X may be prepared by neutralisation of the compound of the formula X for example, with an alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate, for example, sodium or potassium carbonate. The compound of formula X may be prepared by the reaction of glyoxylic acid with the compounds of the formula XI as hereinbefore defined. In an alternative aspect the compound of the formula VII may be prepared by the reaction of a compound of the formulae XII or XIII EMI16.1 wherein R2 is as hereinbefore defined, T is a protecting group for example, a silyl protecting group such as dimethyl t butylsilyl and M is a counter ion for example, lithium with an acylating agent and thereafter removing any protecting group T and converting the NH moiety to N C C02R7 PR4R5R6 in analogous manner to that described hereinbefore. Generally the compound of the formula XIII is generated and utilised in situ. Then the compound of the formula XI may be treated with two equivalents of n butyl lithium in tetrahydrofuran at a low temperature. The dianion may be quenched by the addition of an acylating agent. Generally the compound of the formula XII is generated and used in situ. Thus, the compound of the formula XI may be treated with two equivalents of n butyl lithium in tetrahydrofuran at a low temperature. The anion may be quenched by the addition of an acylating agent. The protecting group T may be introduced and removed in conventional manner, for example, 4 lmethyl allyl l t butyldimethylsilyl azetidin 2 one may be prepared by the reaction of 4 1 methyl1allyl azetidin 2 one with t butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine in an inert solvent. The t butyldimethylsilyl protecting group may be removed when necessary on treatment with potassium fluoride and a crown ether in an inert solvent. The compound of the formula V may also be prepared by the ozonolysis of an ester of a compound of the formula XIV EMI17.1 wherein R1, R2, R4, R5 and R6 are as hereinbefore defined. The ozonolysis is generally performed in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane or ethyl acetate at 700C, followed by m chloroperbenzoic acid. The ester of the compound of the formula XIV may be prepared from a compound of the formula XV in an analogous manner to that described hereinabove EMI17.2 wherein R1 and R2 are as hereinbefore defined. The compound of the formula XV may be prepared by the oxidation of a compound XVI EMI18.1 wherein 21 and R2 are as hereinbefore defined, with pyridinium chlorochromate and thereafter reacting the thus produced aldehyde with Ph3P CHC02CH3. The oxidation may be performed at ambient temperature in dichloromethane. When the oxidation is judged to be complete for example by t.l.c the reaction mixture may be filtered and the phosphorane added to the filtrate. The compound of the formula XVI may be prepared by mild acid hydrolysis of a compound of the formula XVII EMI18.2 wherein R1 and R2 are as hereinbefore defined and Ry and Rz are independently C16 alkyl such as methyl, or are joined together to form a substituted or unsubstituted spirocycloalkyl ring, for example, spiro cyclohexyl. In one aspect compounds of the formula XVII may be prepared by methods analogous to those described in UK Patent Application No. 2013667 ie according to the Scheme EMI19.1 i diazotisation ii Rhodium II acetate iii reduction A preferred aspect of this process is that surprisingly the ring closing cyclisation with Rhodium acetate is stereocontrolled giving 90 of one pair of diastereoisomers, which may be readily separated from the remaining diastereoisomers. In addition, if the starting material, the alcohol NH2CH2CHR20H is optically active then operation of this Scheme results in an optically active bicyclic product which may be elaborated through the hereinbefore described processes to provide an optically active compound of the formula if .
