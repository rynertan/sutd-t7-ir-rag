# Percussion tool utilizing negative pressure.

## Abstract
A percussion tool having a casing 5 in which a percussion element 3 is fitted such that it can move axially over a small distance and in which a hammer 13 for hitting the percussion element 3 is supported axially movably. The hammer 13 is moved towards a rear position by a supply of a high pressure medium A to a high pressure chamber 15 while forming a negative pressure in a low pressure cham ber 14 acting up on the hammer 13 to force it towards a percussion position and, in the rear position, the high pressure is released through ports 27,28 and the exhaust chamber 16 and the handle 24 to allow the hammer 13 to move towards the percussion position by the negative pressure in the low pressure chamber 14 . By avoiding a pressure build up in the rear of the hammer 13 , a recoiling force on the casing 5 with the handle 24 is equally avoided.
