## Description
HYDROCYANATION OF ACTIVATED OLEFINS This invention relates to a novel process for the catalytic addition of gaseous hydrogen cyanide to activated olefins. There are several known methods for hydrocyanating unactivated olefins in the vapor phase. Teter,U.S. Patent 2,385,741, describes the addition of hydrogen cyanide to unactivated olefins in the presence of a finelydivided metallic cobalt catalyst. Darvis, U.S. Patents 3,278,575 and 3,278,576,discloses that finely divided metallic nickel or palladium can also be employed to catalyze the addition of hydrogen cyanide to unactivated olefins. The highest yield of organic nitriles obtained by any of these processes is 42. Furthermore, it is also known in the prior art, i.e. Cordar U.S. Patent 2,904,581, that organic nitriles can be prepared from activated olefins. Activated olefins are hydrocarbons which contain an activating group in close proximity to an olefinic carbon atom.Preferably, this activating group is adjacent to an olefinic carbon. Yields as high as 805S have been obtained by this process. Unfortunately, this is a liquid phase process and both hydrogen cyanide and the activated olefin tend to polymerize at the disclosed reaction conditions. Also, it is very difficult to separate the homogeneous catalyst from the reaction product. The inventive process results in much higher yields of organic nitriles than the prior art vapor phase processes. Furthermore, these higher yields are accomplished at substantially lower temperatures. Finally, since the process of the invention is conducted in the vapor phase the hydrogen cyanide and activated olefin polymerization problem is eliminated. It has now been found that nitriles can be produced by contacting an activated olefin with gaseous hydrogen cyanide in the presence of a catalyst containing at least one element selected from the group consisting of GroupIA and IIA of the Periodic Table. In a particular embodiment of the invention alpha, beta unsaturated alkyl acrylates are contacted with gaseous hydrogen cyanide in the presence of a catalyst containing an alkali metal to produce high yields of cyanoesters. According to the present invention, nitriles are produced by the catalytic addition of hydrogen cyanide to activate olefins. The overall reaction taking place in this process is represented by the following equation EMI2.1 wherein R1, R2, R3 and X are defined below. Nitriles are well known organic chemicals having a wide variety of uses as solvents and the like. They are also important intermediates for the preparation of a broad spectrum of organic chemicals as described, for example, in the text The Chemistry of Organic CyanogenCompounds by V. Migridichian, American Chemical SocietyMonograph No. 105, Reinhold Publishing Company New York, 1947 .Reactants The preferred activated olefins which can be employed in this invention are compounds of the general formula EMI3.1 wherein R1, R1 and R3 are each independently selected from the group consisting of 1 hydrogen 2 C14 alkyl 3 aromatic hydrocarbon radical 4 alicyclic hydrocarbon radical 5 aralkyl hydrocarbon radical EMI3.2 wherein R4 is hydrogen or a C14 alkyl and n is O to 4 andEMI3.3 wherein R5 is hydrogen or a C1 4 alkyl and s is 0 to 4 and wherein X is selected from the group consisting of EMI3.4 wherein R6 is hydrogen or a C1 12 alkyl and t is O to 2 2 CH2 u CN, wherein u is O or 1 andEMI3.5 afherein R7 is hydrogen or a C 1 12 radical and v is O to 2.Examples of these activated olefin include acrolein, methacrolein, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, methyl acrylate and ethyl acrylate. Preferably, R1, R2 and R3 are each independently selected from 1 hydrogen 2 C14 alkyl and X is selected from the group consisting of EMI4.1 wherein R6 is H or C14 alkyl 2 CN EMI4.2 wherein R7 is H or C14 alkyl. More preferably, the olefinically unsaturated compounds comprise compounds wherein R1, R2 and R3 are each independently selected from hydrogen and methyl and wherein X isEMI4.3 andEMI4.4 The activated olefin is contacted with gaseous hydrogen cyanide to produce the cyanoester. The ratio of the olefin to hydrogen cyanide is not critical. The instant reaction will proceed with either excess olefin or excess hydrogen cyanide. However, the use of excess activated olefin is preferred, since this minimizes the loss of HCN. Accordingly, it is preferred to employ a molar ratio of activated olefin to HCN of greater than one and preferably between one to ten, in particular from one to two. If desired, a carrier gas which is inert to the reactants, products and catalysts can be included in the reaction system. Thus, gases such as nitrogen, the noble gases, lower alkanes, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, ammonia and minor amounts of hydrogen sulfide can be added to the reaction system.Process Conditions In carrying out the inventive process, the activated olefin and hydrogen cyanide in the vapor phase are contacted with a catalyst as described below. This process is preferably conducted on a continuous basis but it can also be accomplished in a batch mode. Either fixed and fluid catalyst beds can be used. The reaction temperature is normally maintained between 400C and 3500C, preferably 1500C to 3000 C. The reaction pressure is normally maintained at O to 7 kg cm2 100 psi , preferably 0.7 kg cmê to 2 8 kg cmê 10 to 40 psi . When the process is carried out in the continuous basis, the contact time is normally ten seconds to ten minutes, preferably 10 seconds to 5 minutes. When the reaction is carried out in a batch mode, reactants and catalysts are contacted with one another for a period of 10 minutes to 6 hours, preferably 1 hour to 4 hours. A reaction time of less than 10 minutes or more than 6 hours can be used if desired, although better results will be obtained if the reaction time is maintained within this range.Catalyst The heterogeneous catalyst employed in this process comprises at least one element selected from the group consisting of Group IA and IIA of the Periodic Table or a mixture of elements from each Periodic Table. Preferred catalysts comprise at least one of K, Li, Cs, Ca, Ba andMg. Especially preferred catalysts contain at least one of K, Li and Cs. This catalyst can be promoted with a wide variety of metals selected from groups VIB, VIIB,VIII and IB. Preferred promoters include Ru, Cr, Mn, Cu,Ni and Ti. The catalyst used according to the present invention is primarily a compound of a metal capable of withstanding the temperatures employed. These various metal compounds include oxides, hydroxides, and various salts, e.g. ferrocyanides, phophates, carbonates, silicates, aluminates, cyanides and salts of organic acids such as the acetates, formates and butyrates. Preferred catalysts contain oxygen or oxygen containing anions. The free metals may also be used. Compounds which are somewhat basic in nature or which at least in part react with hydrogen cyanide to form metal cyanides have been found to be particularly good. The catalyst can be prepared by methods well known in the art. For example, these catalysts can be produced by evaporating a solution of a soluble compound on an inert carrier, or mixing an aqueous slurry of an insoluble compound or of the free metal with an inert carrier, filtering, pressing, drying and calcining the filter cake, and finally grinding the filter cake to the desired particle size. The inert carriers which may be used with this catalyst include aluminates, silicates, titanates and phosphates and mixtures thereof. Preferred carriers are aluminates and silicates. Basic compounds such as quartz, diatomaceous earth, various clays and pumice may also be used.Recovery The reaction product obtained upon completion of this reaction are partially in the gas phase. This reaction product can be subjected to suitable known separation techniques to obtain the desired end product. For example, the product can be condensed to a liquid. The liquid product can then be filtered to remove catalyst therefrom and then separated into component parts by the use of solvent extraction and distillation.
