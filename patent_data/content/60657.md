# High electron mobility heterojunction semiconductor devices.

## Abstract
This invention provides for modulation of the characteris tics of high electron mobility heterojunction semiconductor devices after production of the devices has been completed. The characteristics of such a device are modulated by ex posing the device to electromagnetic radiation. The character istics can be further modulated by warming the device, by ex posing the device to further electromagnetic radiation, or by selective application of voltages to control electrodes of the device. The facility for modulating the characteristics of high elec tron mobility heterojunction semiconductor devices provides for a diversification of the uses of such devices. In particular, programmable memory devices can be constructed. One such programmable memory device relies upon the newly discovered and applied phenomenon that the reflectivity of a high electron mobility heterojunction semiconductor ele ment is a device characteristic which can be modified after completion of production thereof.
