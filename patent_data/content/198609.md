## Description
This invention relates to printing inks. More particularly it relates to publication gravure printing inks. Inks conventionally used for the gravure printing of magazines, inserts and newspapers comprise a pigment, a solvent, and a metal resinate. These inks are deficient in gloss and holdout, particularly on poor quality uncoated stock. It has now been found that printability on low quality paper stock and gloss on coated paper stock can be improved with inks, preferably gravure printing inks, prepared with a novel modified metal resinate vehicle. The novel resinate is a polyamide modified metal resinate. It is the reaction product of a metal resinate with an amine reactive polyamide. It is best prepared by reacting a metal resinate with an amine reactive polyamide in solution at an elevated temperature. The metal resinate is acidic and preferably has an acid value of 5 to 175. The polyamide is basic due to amine functionality and preferably has an amine value of 5 to 350. Suitable metal resinates include calcium, zinc, and magnesium salts of a resin, either alone or in combination with rosins, including dimerised rosin, polymerised rosin, maleated rosin, phenolated rosin, or their mixtures. Tall oil, gum rosin, or wood rosin can also be used in combination with the metal resinate. The resin used for forming the metal resinate is chosen from a carboxyl functional hydrocarbon resin, preferably having a melting point above 100 C, a metallised phenol formaldehyde resin calcium zinc phenol formaldehyde resinate was used in the examples , a metallised carboxyl functional phenol formaldehyde resin ester or a metallised maleinised dicyclo pentadiene hydrocarbon resin. Amine reactive polyamides that are used to modify the metal resinate are reaction products of dimerised fatty acids trimerised fatty acids C₂ C₂₀ monobasic acids diamines such as ethylene diamine, hexamethylene diamine, and neopentyl diamine polyamines such as diethylene triamine and triethylene tetramine and their mixtures. The reaction is essentially the amine salt formation of the amino groups of the polyamide and the carboxyl groups of the metal resinate. The two ingredients are generally reacted in the ratio of 1 5 carboxyl equivalents of the metal resinate to 1 amine equivalent of the polyamide, and preferably the ratio is 2 carboxyl equivalents to 1 amine equivalent. The reaction temperature is generally 25 to 100 C, and preferably 70 to 90 C. Solvents suitable for use in the reaction include toluene, Lactol Spirits Trade Mark for a mixture of heptane and toluene , Rotosolve Trade Mark for a mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons , or mixtures thereof. These polyamide modified metal resinates have a higher viscosity than the unmodified metal resinates, enabling them to be used with low cost solvents. Inks formulated with these products as the vehicles have improved holdout non penetration properties on low quality porous paper stock. The invention will be illustrated by the following examples in which all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that the following ingredients were used 500 parts 0.345 equivalent of a solution of a calcium zinc magnesium resinate in 40 60 toluene Lactol Spirits 121 parts 0.275 equivalent of a 55 solids solution in toluene of a polyamide prepared from dimerized fatty acids, soya fatty acid, and diethlyene triamine having an amine value of 340 500 parts of toluene and 310 parts of Lactol Spirits. The product had a Gardner Holdt viscosity 25 C of Z4, a Gardner color 25 C of 12, and contained 25 of non volatile material. As in Example 1, a publication gravure printing ink was formulated and used to print supplement stock. The results were comparable, that is, the print had excellent holdout and gloss. The procedure of Example 1 was repeated with each of the following metal resinates instead of calcium zinc resinate calcium resinate and magnesium resinate. The results were comparable. The procedure of Example 1 was repeated with each of the following polyamides instead of one prepared from dimerized fatty acids, tall oil fatty acid, and diethylene triamine a polyamide prepared from dimer acids, propionic acid, triethylene tetramine, and ethylene diamine and a polyamide prepared from dimer acids, sebacic acid, tall oil fatty acid, and diethylene triamine. The results were comparable. The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that each of the following solvents was used instead of toluene Lactol Spirits toluene, Rotosolve, and Lactol Spirits. The results were comparable. For the purpose of comparison a publication gravure printing ink was formulated with 55 parts of unmodified calcium zinc resinate containing 60 non volatile material and 45 parts of blue pigment. The product was then cut to print viscosity with toluene Lactol Spirits, and the blue ink product was used to print insert stock. The inks made from the products of Examples 1 and 2 were consistently better than the ink of this Example in printability of low quality paper stock, e.g., in holdout non penetration , gloss, and color development. The inks made from the products of Examples 1 and 2 also gave much better gloss on coated paper stock than did the product of the Comparative Example.
