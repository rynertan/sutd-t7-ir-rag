# SEAL FOR A DOOR FOR A COKE OVEN, A DOOR FOR A COKE OVEN HAVING THE SEAL AND A COKE OVEN HAVING THE DOOR

## Abstract
To seal against the surround of the door opening of a coke oven, the door has an elongate knife edge element 8 which engages the surround 7 and is held against a sealing surface on the side of the door. The knife edge element is movable past the sealing surface on the door for adjustment. The knife edge element is divided into a plurality of mutually abutting parts 81,82,83 in the adjustment direction. In order to allow a greater amount of adjustment of the knife edge element and to make assembly of the seal easier, holding means 13,16,19,30 e.g. a plurality of brackets, are provided to hold the parts of the knife edge together in the adjustment direction and to restrain at least the outermost part 83 from lateral movement relative to the door. The holding means permits relative sliding of the parts in the longitudinal direction.
