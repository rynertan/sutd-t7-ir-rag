# Surgical dressing.

## Abstract
An adhesive dressing for use on moist wounds which comprises a pressure sensitive adhesive coated wound contacting first layer in which there are present holes capable of transmitting liquid water and a moisture vapour permeable, continuous film. The continuous film is attached to the first layer in such a way as to form a reservoir into which water can pass through the holes in the first layer and can evaporate from the reservoir through the continuous film. The adhesive coated first layer has a moisture vapour permeability of less than 300gm ² 24hr ¹ at 37 C and 100 to 10 relative humidity difference and the continuous film has a moisture vapour permeability which is greater when in contact with liquid water than when not in contact with liquid water. Optionally, an intermediate water transmitting layer may be present between the first layer and the continuous film.
