# NARROW FREQUENCY BAND ACOUSTIC TRANSDUCER

## Abstract
A narrow frequency band, acoustic transducer of high conversion efficiency over a narrow frequency band, which transducer comprises a truncated diaphragm having a depressed, circular area and a peripheral edge about the circular area and a convex cap section extending outwardly from the circular area a vibration board adhesively secured about the peripheral edge of the diaphragm, to couple acoustically the vibration board to the diaphragm on one side and a piezoelectric element centrally secured to the other side of the vibration board, with electrical leads to the piezoelectric element, whereby electrical energy input to the piezoelectric element provides a high decibel acoustical output about the natural resonance frequency of the vibra tion board.
