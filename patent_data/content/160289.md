## Description
Hydraulic Control System This invention relates to a hydraulic control system according to the preamble of claim 1. Such hydraulic systems are found, for example, on mobile equipment, such as excavators and cranes, and are used to control an actuator, such as a hydraulic cylinder or hydraulic motor. The actuator normally has two openings or ports to be used alternately as inlet or outlet. A known system of that kind US A 4,201,052 has several valves housed in a valve body designed to be mounted directly on the actuator. The valves comprise an independent pilot operated meter in valve, a pair of load drop check valves, a pair of independently operated, normally closed meter out valves, a pair of load pressure responsive valves, and a pair of anti cavitation valves.The meter in valve functions to direct fluid flow to one or the other of the actuator ports. The normally closed meter out valves are associated with each of the actuator ports for controlling fluid flow from the port opposite to the actuator port to which the meter in valve is directing fluid. The meter out valves function as variable orifices metering fluid between the appropriate actuator port and a low pressure zone such as a reservoir tank. Each of the meter out valves has associated therewith a load pressure responsive element which acts on the meter out valves in response to load pressure to enable the meter out valves to also provide pressure relief protection. The anticavitation valves are associated with each of the actuator ports and are adapted to open the appropriate port to tank. The valve body is directly mounted to the actuator port manifold and is supplied by one full flow high pressure line, a pair of pilot pressure lines, and a load sensing line. The operation of the valves is controlled through the pilot lines from a manually operated hydraulic remote control valve. In the absence of a command signal from the hydraulic remote control, the meter in valve assumes a centered or neutral position with the check valves, the meter out elements, the pressure responsive valves, and the anti cavitation valves, all in closed position. In the neutral position, the valve system prevents uncontrolled lowering of loads and in the case of overrunning loads, prevents fluid flow from the high pressure fluid source to the actuator even in the event of a ruptured line.When the meter in valve is used as a flow control unit, it is usually difficult to obtain optimum stability of the load due to the high pressure gain in the outlet line of the meter in valve. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a valve system of the aforementioned type which is operable in a counterbalance mode or with the use of external counterbalance valves or brakes with improved stability. It is further an object of the invention to provide a hydraulic system having a proportional relationship between metered fluid flow and pressure in the output line of a flow control valve to maintain stability in the controlled lowering of an overhauling load. It is another object of this invention to provide a hydraulic system which incorporates means for controlling an overhauling load and which hydraulic system has greater stability than prior hydraulic systems. These problems are solved by the teaching of the claims. Embodiments of the invention are described using the drawings in which Fig. 1 is a schematic drawing of a first hydraulic control system, Fig. 2 is a sectional view of an essential part of the system of Fig. 1, Fig. 3 is a schematic drawing of a second hydraulic control system, Fig. 4 is a sectional view of an essential part of the system of Fig. 3, and Fig. 5 is a schematic drawing of a third hydraulic control system. Referring to Fig. 1, the hydraulic control system embodying the invention comprises an actuator 20, herein shown as a linear hydraulic cylinder, having an output shaft 21 that is moved in opposite directions by hydraulic fluid supplied from a variable displacement pump 22 which has load sensing control 79 through 82 as is fully described inEP oo89,652 A3. The hydraulic control system further includes a manually operated controller 23 that directs high or low pilot pressure through pilot port C1 or C2 to a valve system 24 for controlling the direction of movement of the actuator 20. Fluid from the pump 22 is directed through supply lines 25 and 26 and a pump port P to a meter in valve 27 that functions to direct and control the flow of hydraulic fluid to one or the other actuator lines A or B connected to the actuator 20.The pilot ports C1 and C2 lead through pilot control lines 28, 30 and pilot control lines 29, 31, respectively, to the opposed ends of the meter in valve 27. Depending upon the direction of movement of the meter in valve 27, hydraulic fluid passes through passages 32, 33 and actuator lines A or B to one or the other end 20a, 20b. The hydraulic control system further includes normally closed exhaust valves 34 , 35 , each positioned between lines A or B and a return passage 36 leading to a tank port T. The exhaust valves 34 , 35 control the return flow of fluid to tank. The hydraulic control system further incudes spring loaded poppet valves 37, 38 in the passages 32,33 and spring loaded anti cavitation valves 39, 40 which are opened when pressure in the return passage 36 is higher than in the passage 32 or 33. In addition, spring loaded poppet valves 41, 42 Figs .2,4 are associated with each valve 34d, 35d acting as pilot operated relief valves. The system also includes a back pressure valve 44 connected to the tank port T and associated with the return passage 36. Back pressure valve 44 functions to minimize cavitation when an overrunning or a lowering load tends to drive the actuator 20 down. A charge pump relief valve 45 is provided to take excess flow above the inlet requirements of the pump 22 and apply it to the back pressure valve 44 to augment the fluid available to the actuator. Meter in valve 27 comprises a bore in which a spool is positioned. At low pilot pressure normally the spool is maintained in a neutral position by springs and blocks the flow from the supply line26 to the passages 32, 33.When high pilot pressure is applied to either end of the spool, the spool moves until a force balance exists among the high pilot pressure, the spring load and the flow forces.The direction of movement determines which of the passages 32, 33 is provided with fluid under pressure from supply line 2G me single meter in valve 27 may be replaced by two meter in valves as shown in DE 3,O1l,088 Al. When high pilot pressure is applied to either control line 28, 30 or 39, 31 leading to the meter in valve 27 and to exhaust valves 34 or 35 , such exhaust valve is actuated to admit flow from the return actuator lineA or B to the passage 36, whereas the other exhaust valve remains closed. Lines 28a,..29a in Figs. 1 and 2 provide positive pressure to hold such exhaust valve closed. As is fully described in EP oo85,962 A3, the meterout or exhaust valves 34d, 35d are of the poppet type and have back pressure spaces 63a and 63b, respectively, which are connected to the actuator lines A and B through orifices 62a and 62b, respectively, and can be vented by retracting a stem 65a and 65b, respectively, each is connected to a piston 67a and 67b, respectively. When pilot pressure is admitted through control line 28, piston 67a and stem 65a are moved and back pressure space 63a vented so that pressure in the return actuator lineA opens exhaust valve 34 . Similar operation is carried out with pilot pressure in control line 29 and exhaust valve 35 . The exhaust valves 34 , 35 are also controlled by the poppet valves 41, 42. These poppet valves 41, 42 are acted upon, on one side, by pressure in the acLudLul line A or B, and, on the other side, by the same pressure, yet delayed. To that end, a restricted passage 72 through check valve 37 leads to an accumulator volume 72a and to a spring cavity 41a of the poppet valve 41. So poppet valve 41 is sensitive for sudden pressure rises in actuator line A and lowers the respond pressure Ansprechwert of the exhaust valve 34 for a short time. This is accomplished by venting the back pressure space 63a of exhaust valve 34 to low presure in return passage 36 via a passage 73a. A similar arrangement is with poppet valve 42 including another accumulator volume 72b, orifice 62b and passage 73b.When the pressure rise has passed, poppet valve 41 or 42 returns in its normal position shutting off the passage 73a or 73b, so that back pressure in valve 34 or 35 is again built up. A pressure divider means is provided between line 32 and meter out or exhaust valve 35 Figs. 1 4 which divider consists of a bleed line 58 including restrictors 59, 60 and a tapping line 61 including a damping restrictor 62. In Figs. 1 and 2 the bleed line 58 is connected to line 28a. A similar arrangement may be provided between line 33 and the meter out or exhaust valve 34. If both pressure divider means are provided, the bleed lines 58 can be connected to the return passage 36 through a line 47 Figs. 3 and 4 . When meter in valve 27 is centered low pilot pressures , restricted passages 27a, 27b in the valve spool connect pilot line 30 to passage 32 and pilot line 31 to passage 33. When meter in valve 27 is operated to direct fluid to the actuator through passage 32, restrictors 59 and 60 placed in the bleed line 58 provide for an approximately four to one 4 1 build up of pressure between the pressure in lines 32 and 6t, i.e. the second meter out valve 35 will crack open at one fourth the pressure in line 32.The build up of the pressure in line 32 will apply back pressure on anti cavitation valve 39 preventing reirculation of fluid exhausting from the second meter out valve 95 to the atuator. ch recirculation of fluid would result in undesirable overspeeding when the actuator is driven by an overhauling load. Applying back pressure to the anti cavitation valve 39 also prevents overheating of the actuator by allowing fresh fluid to be applied to the actuator by the pump.Restrictors 59 and 60 in combination with restrictor 62 in line 61 also augment the load stability by providing additional damping to the system, i.e. slowing the speed of response of the second meterout valve 35 when subjected to sudden pressure surges. Referring to Fig. 5, a circuit is shown wherein a normally open exhaust valve 52 and a hydraulic brake 55 are utilized to control a lowering or possible overhauling load. The actuator shown comprises a rotary hydraulic motor 56 having ports 56a, 56b. The e brake 55 has a piston 55a, a control chamber 55c and spring means 55b acting against the force developed in the control chamber 55c. Control pressure for chamber 55c is provided by a pressure divider means consisting of a bleed line 51 including restrictors 59, 60 and a tappy line 61 including a restrictor 62. when the iaeter in valve 27 is operated by pilot pressure 29 to direct fluid to lower a load, the pressure in lines 32, 61 is applied to disengage the brake 55. If the load tends to overrun, the pressure in line 32 is becoming reduced tending to re engage the brake. The restrictors 59, 60, 62 can be used to adjust the proper pressure when the brake 55 should be moved. Furthermore, pressure surges in line 32 are not followed by brake oscillations, since the brake control pressure is damped by the restrictors 59, 62.
