# Coating resin composition.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a resin composition comprising the reaction product obtained by reacting an isopropenylphenol and or its oligomers with a straight chain unsaturated fatty acid, an unsaturated fat or oil, a polymer of diene hydrocarbon or its derivative having carboxyl or hydroxyl substituents at the ends of the polymer molecule, or a maleinized polymer of diene hydrocarbon and then reacting the resulting intermediate product with a polyhydric alcohol and or a polybasic acid. When used as a coating and particularly as an undercoating for metals, this resin composition exhibits excellent resistance to corrosion and to water. It may either be directly used as an oil soluble resin composition or be neutralized with a base prior to use as a water soluble one.
