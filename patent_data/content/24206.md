# Antitumor substance, composition comprising it and process for preparing said substance.

## Abstract
The toxicity of a known antitumor substance prepared by culturing a microorganism, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. microformis SC 1714 is reduced by treatment with barium hydroxide and isolating an antitumor substance having an excellent antitumor activity as well as a potent immunostimulatory activity. The novel substance is effective when administered in very small amounts without harmful effects such as toxicity.
