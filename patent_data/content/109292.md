# Apparatus for blending wood strands with a liquid resin.

## Abstract
The apparatus and process are concerned with blending wood strands with a liquid resin. The apparatus overcomes some of the problems that exist with present day blenders because it avoids clogging spray nozzles and allows complete coating of the strands with a minimum amount of resin. The ap paratus forms a substantially constant flow of wood strands into a first falling curtain 16 of separated wood strands, the first curtain having a predetermined substantially constant width. A first liquid spray including at least one spray nozzle 17 located on each side of the first falling curtain of separated wood strands away from the first falling curtain is adapted to spray liquid resin droplets for the width of the first curtain, but not substantially beyond. A collector collects the first sprayed wood strands and forms them into a second falling curtain 22 of separated wood strands, the second curtain having a pre determined width. A second spray including at least one spray nozzle 23 located on each side of the second falling curtain 22 of separated wood strands away from the second falling curtain is adapted to spray liquid resin droplets for the width of the second curtain but not substantially beyond.
