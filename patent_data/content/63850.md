# Device for controlling the synchronism of two motors.

## Abstract
Device for synchronizing two asynchronous rotary field motors M1, M2 , the output of said motors being via reduction gears R1, R2 connected to the movable parts of synchronizers S1, S2 of for instance the selsyn type, said synchronizers being connected to generate a correction signal dependent on direction and value of a positional difference between the said mov able parts, said motors being controlled by a frequency converter F1, F2 the output frequency of which is controlled by an electrical input 18, 19 , at least one of said inputs being combined with said correction signal, R.C. circuits 13, 15 14, 16 controlling the time function of the said electrical inputs.
