## Description
This invention relates to thermoplastic polyimide, poly esterimide and polyamide acid compositions, and preparation thereof. Many attempts have been made to modify the properties of polyimides or polyimide containing compositions by incorporating various aromatic moieties in their molecular structure to provide improved processing characteristics and thermal stability. These polymers, however, have generally not been completely satisfactory in that they do not readily lend themselves to preparation or processing by hot melt procedures, are deficient in thermal stability or may lack other useful characteristics such as good adhesion or solvent resistance. The preparation of polyimides which are stable at high temperatures is known. Thermally stable polyimides have been prepared by reacting various aromatic tetracarboxylic acids or their derivatives, such as dianhydrides, with aromatic diprimary amines to form polyamide acids which are soluble in dipolar aprotic organic solvents. The polyamide acids are then cyclized either by heat treatment or by chemical means to form the polyimides. Such polyimides, however, generally are intractable and infusible as well as being insoluble in most solvents making them difficult, if not impossible, to fabricate into molded parts. Moreover, when a polyamide acid prepolymer solution is prepared and then heat cured in situ to the polyimide, the temperature required may be too high for the substrate coated and appreciable amounts of water are uncontrollably released in addition to evaporation of the solvent. This raises other limitations as to the type of uses for such materials. In recent years, various aromatic and heterocyclic materials have been investigated in attempts to obtain thermally stable polyimides that could be more readily prepared and fabricated. It is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,699,075 and 3,812,159 to Lubowitz, U.S. Patent No. 3,847,867 to Heath et al and U.S. Patent No. 3,879,428 to Heath that aromatic diether polycarboxylic acids and anhydrides thereof could be reacted with aromatic diamines to prepare thermally stable, high molecular weight polyimides which are soluble in organic solvents and fusible. Such polyimides are suggested as being suitable for use in preparing coatings, adhesives, films and the like or for fabrication into useful parts by conventional molding equipment. However, known polyimides prepared in this manner appear to exhibit certain deficiencies such as low Tg, inadequate adhesion to many substrates, and generally poor solvent resistance. It has also been suggested, for example, in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,017,459 4,064,289 4,239,880 and 4,405,770 that aromatic diether diamines can be reacted with tetracarboxylic acid and its derivative to prepare soluble poly amide imides or polyimides which may also be melt processible. Further, in U.S. Patent No. 3,563,951 it is suggested that thermally stable polyimides which are fusible and soluble can be prepared by reacting high molecular weight diamine capped aromatic polyether oligomers with non diether containing aromatic tetracarboxylic acid or an anhydride derivative thereof. The uncertainty of being able to prepare soluble and melt processible polyimide and poly amide imide polymers from such aromatic diamines is shown by other researchers where, for example, in a paper by George L. Brode et al., published in Journal of Polymer Science, Vol. 12, pp. 575 587 1974 it is reported that polymers prepared with aromatic diether diamines containing a sulfonyl linkage were more melt processible than polymers having a propane linkage and in a paper published in Makomolecular Science, Vol. 1, pp. 667 670 1980 it is reported that the reaction of 2,2 bis 4 p aminophenoxy phenyl propane with pyromellitic dianhydride and 4,4 carbonyldi phthalic anhydride resulted in the preparation of insoluble polyimides. US A 4444979 describes polyphenylene ethers with imide linking units, and incorporating oxygen and or sulphur and or sulphone linking units between aromatic rings in the molecular backbone. Thermoplastic and or hot melt flow properties are asserted. CH₂ is also mentioned as a possible spacer group for aromatic rings. One aspect of the present invention provides a thermoplastic polyimide, poly esterimide or polyamide acid composition which contains at least 10mol of the reaction product of Preferably X₁ and X₂ each is a divalent group of the formula wherein In a preferred embodiment, R⁴ and R⁵ each independently is substituted or unsubstituted alkyl of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, substituted alkenyl of 2 to 8 carbon atoms, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl of 4 to 8 carbon atoms or mixtures thereof. Exemplary of suitable diamino compounds of formula a are wherein A is a tetravalent radical derived from substituted or unsubstituted aromatic or aliphatic dianhydrides. Thus, A can be a substituted or unsubstituted tetravalent group of formula where m is 0 or 1 and E is O , S , S S , where R is a substituted or unsubstituted, linear or branched, alkylene or arylene of 1 to 30 carbon atoms, substituted or unsubstituted linear, branched or cyclic alkylene of 1 to 30 carbon atoms, or alkenylene of 2 to 30 carbon atoms. Alternatively, A may be , for example, a substituted or unsubstituted benzene or naphthalene nucleus, an aliphatic radical such as cyclopentane, cyclohexane or butane. Substituents on A may be one or more groups that do not interfere with the use of such dianhydrides in preparing the polymers of the invention. Exemplary of radicals included in A are O , S , Specific dianhydrides are, for example A can also be the tetravalent residue of formula where G is phenylene or a substituted or unsubstituted group of formula X₃ and X₄ each independently is O , substituted linear or branched alkylene of 1 to 30 carbon atoms, such as or alkenylene of 2 to 30 carbon atoms. Exemplary of the radicals which X₃ and X₄ may independently be are O , Similarly, and by analogy, the ether linkage can be replaced by COO to provide useful dianhydrides. Because of relative availability, some of the preferred species of aromatic dianhydrides are It has been discovered that polymers such as polyimides or poly esterimides which contain the reaction product of aromatic or aliphatic dianhydrides and aromatic diamines herein described or mixtures thereof with other diamines display properties that are totally surprising and unexpected. The polyimides of this invention are thermoplastic or hot melt processible and are generally soluble in many chlorinated hydrocarbon, dipolar aprotic, alkyl capped polyethylene glycol alkyl capped glymes solvents and mixtures thereof and mixtures of such solvents with various hydrocarbons. These polymers also display tenacious adhesion to a variety of organic and inorganic substrates and exhibit excellent thermal stability and, thus, can be employed as adhesives, coatings, films, fibers, etc. The polyamide acids are readily suitable for conversion to thermoplastic and soluble polyamides, by heat or chemical cyclization means. Also provided in a further aspect of the present invention is a method of preparing the composition which comprises reacting a dianhydride of the type described above with an aromatic diamine having the formula described above for the time necessary to prepare the desired polymer. The polymers can generally be prepared using melt polymerization as well as solution polymerization techniques. It has been found that polymers which contain at least 10 mole percent of the residue having the formulae or mixtures thereof, have improved properties if said polymers also contain at least 10 mole percent of a residue of the formulae or mixtures thereof as defined above. Polymers of this invention are generally composed of recurring units having the formulae or mixtures thereof, wherein Polymers of this invention also include Polymers composed of recurring structural units of formula i or ii with up to 90 mole percent intercondensed recurring structural units of the formulae wherein Thus part or all of the diamine reactants which can be used to prepare the polymers can comprise one or more of the diamines b as described above, or the diamine s b may be present in an amount of as little as 10 mole percent and up to 90 mole percent of the total diamine requirements may be satisfied by one or more of the other diamines having the general formula H₂N B NH₂ as described hereinabove. Suitably, the other diamine s are aromatic in nature such that B can be e.g. substituted or unsubstituted phenylene, biphenylene, naphthylene or anthracenylene, or a group of the formula wherein m is 0 or 1, and E is substituted or unsubstituted, branched or linear alkylene of 1 to 30 carbons, S , Any of the aryl nuclei can be substituted by lower alkyl, lower alkoxy or other noninterfering substituent groups and alkylene groups can be substituted by halogen. Among the other diamines that are useful are B can also be the divalent residue of formula wherein G is a substituted or unsubstituted phenylene or group of the formula Suitably such other diamine is an aromatic diether diamine such as The residuum B can also be a heterocyclic aromatic of 6 to 20 carbon atoms while the hetero atoms are one or more of N , O and S , such as pyridine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, oxadiazine, oxathiazine, triazine, benzofuran, thionaphthene, indole, quinoline, benzoxazole, benzothiophene and carbazole. B can also be the residue of a bis amino polysiloxane as disclosed and illustrated by US A 4,395,527, of the formula wherein D is unsubstituted or substituted hydrocarbylene B can also be the residue of a di aminoalkyl polysiloxane of the general formula where It is apparent that in accordance with the practice of the invention there are a number of variables available to the chemist in formulating useful polyimides, polyamide acids and poly esterimides . The present polymers display excellent thermal stability as well as adhesion characteristics which are as good as or superior to those found with other known polyimides. Thus, they can be processed quite readily using conventional melt processing fabrication techniques into molded products that display high thermal stability or can be used for coating and adhesion applications where tenacious adhesion and thermal stability would be important. The melt processible polymers of this invention are capable of being readily formed and shaped by conventional techniques such as molding, extrusion, calendering, etc. Products fabricated from these polymers exhibit good thermal resistance as well as resistance to degradation caused by various environmental conditions. Solutions of these polymers in solvents such as those described above can be used to coat a variety of substrates including electrical and electronic components such solutions can also be used to cast films or spin fibers. These polymer compositions also exhibit excellent adhesion to a variety of substrates including those prepared from polyimide, poly amide imide and poly esterimide resins and thus can be used as primary or secondary adhesives or coatings for or between a number of different metallic and non metallic materials. Surprisingly, it has been found that the present polymers are soluble and thermoplastic or melt processible even when a substantial portion of the defined aromatic diamine a is replaced by one or more other diamines. Polyimides, poly amide acids and poly esterimides of the invention which are melt processible and soluble e.g. in chlorinated hydrocarbon or dipolar aprotic solvents can be prepared with up to 90 mole percent of the diamine content being diamine other than that having formula a . Thus, the properties of the polymers of the invention can be varied over a very broad range, depending on the particular combination of reactants that are chosen. In addition to adjusting the reactants, one can also modify the properties of polymers of the invention by blending different polymers. Different polyimides, poly amide imides and or poly esterimides can be mixed and blended to provide desired properties. The reaction between the dianhydride component and aromatic diamine component to prepare the polyamide acid and polyimide compositions of this invention may be effected in a suitable solvent and optionally in the presence of a condensation catalyst. The solvent should dissolve the reactants as well as the product. Suitable solvents include, for example, a dipolar aprotic liquid such as N,N dimethylformamide DMF , dimethylacetamide, N methyl 2 pyrrolidone, hexamethylphosphortriamide, dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO and tetramethyurea chlorinated solvents such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene and trichlorobenzene glyme solvents such as ethylene glycol dimethyl ether and diethylene glycol dimethyl ether and mixtures thereof. Where combinations of reactants will be employed, e.g. combinations of anhydrides and or amines, attention should be paid to the reactivity of the components. In synthesizing the polymers of the invention, the total anhydride component and total amine are generally employed in equimolar amounts. While some excess of one of these is not detrimental to the condensation reaction, a considerable excess may result in the production of lower molecular weight products or undesirable by products. Since all or part of the diamine component employed to produce the polyimide, poly esterimide and polyamide acids of the invention can be the aromatic diamine compounds of formula a , the polymer will contain from 10 mole percent of the residue of said aromatic diamine component in addition to one or more other diamines to 100 mole percent of said aromatic diamine component with no other diamine components. Thus, there can be used from 10 mole percent to 100 mole percent of the aromatic diamine component or mixtures thereof however, the majority of applications will call for polymers containing from 15 mole percent to 85 mole percent of the specified aromatic amine component and from 15 to 85 mole percent of other diamine components. Where the polyimide will contain 100 mole percent of the aromatic diamine of formula a , the following sequence of reaction steps has been found to be effective Where the polyimide will contain a diamine component or components in addition to the aromatic diamine of formula a , the polyimide may be prepared with a random molecular configuration, a block block molecular configuration, a random block random molecular structure, a block random molecular structure depending on the properties desired and the reactivity of the relative combination of reactants. Thus, the dianhydride component can be first reacted with the aromatic diamine component in a suitable solvent. The components may be either a single aromatic diamine or dianhydride or mixtures thereof. After completion of the reaction and removal of water that may be produced, the third component and or fourth component, either another diamine, a different dianhydride or mixtures thereof is added to the reaction product mixture and the mixture is heated to an elevated temperature for a sufficient time to produce a polymeric solution of the polyimide which polymer may be recovered as described above or by other suitable method known in the art. Where the desired product is a polyamide acid, the diamine component or combinations of such components are cooled to 0 C. The dianhydride component or components is thereafter added gradually, over an extended period of time with the temperature being maintained from 0 C to 100 C, and preferably from 20 C to 40 C. The polyamide acid forms readily without the application of heat and without catalysts. The polyamide acid thus formed can be readily converted to the polyimide by subjecting the polymer to cyclization. The cyclization can be effected using any of the methods known in the art for converting isolated polyamide acids or solutions thereof to polyimides. For example, cyclization of the polyamide acid can be effected by heating the polyamide acid at a temperature of from 150 C to 250 C. Alternatively, the polyimides of the invention can also be prepared by hot melt polymerization, in the absence of solvents. The materials are simply combined in generally equimolar amounts, mixed and heated. One such method involves combining the materials in an extruder heated to about 300 C and extruding, on a continuous basis, the polyimide product. It may also be desirable to add a chain stopper to the reaction mixture to control the molecular weight of the polymer produced. For example, phthalic anhydride or aniline may be used, preferably in an amount from 1 percent to 5 percent by weight. Polyimides and poly esterimides of the invention have a variety of uses. They are melt processible and can be employed in the fabrication, by molding, of a variety of articles which possess structural strength and resistance to deformation or degradation at high temperatures. Because of their solubility, excellent high temperature characteristics and electrical qualities they are particularly suitable for use in a number of electrical and electronic applications. The polymers of the invention are suitable for use in electronic applications such as wire enamels, as conformal, protective, junction and passivation coatings for electrical devices, printed circuit boards and semiconductor devices. The polymers can be easily applied and cured in place. They will not degrade in use, and will generally enhance the electrical characteristics of the device to which they are applied. They adhere very tenaciously to the surface to which they are applied and prevent migration of ions on the surface of the device. When employed with semiconductor devices, they do not release any materials during drying cycles which are deleterious to the operating characteristics of the device. The polymers are also capable of being applied in multiple layers to provide a thick coating when required and are able to bond well to itself as well as to many metallic and non metallic substrates. The polyimides and poly esterimides are translucent. Such materials, while retaining the other desirable characteristics, are useful to fabricate photovoltaic devices. They are desirable for bonding a light emitting diode to the surface of another semiconductor device to turn the device on and off in response to the operation of the light emitting diode. Copolymer materials of this invention are also applicable for use in bonding protective covers to exposed surfaces of photovoltaic devices such as solar cells. The dielectric strength of the polymer may be further enhanced by admixing suitable filler materials therein. Preferably, an electrically insulating material having a dielectric constant which is approximately the same as the polymer is admixed therein. The filler material is uniformly distributed throughout the coating as applied to a substrate. Other material suitable as a filler material are those materials known to have a relatively good ability to resist electrical conduction although their dielectric constant is higher than that of the polymer. Suitable electrically insulating filler materials have been found to include aluminum oxide, silicon oxide, glass fibers, boron nitride, quartz, mica, magnesium oxide and activated polytetrafluorethylene in a finely divided, or pulverized form. Whether a filled or unfilled polyimide or poly esterimide is employed, the electrical properties of a given device are generally enhanced. The polyimide or poly esterimide has an inherent elasticity to withstand repeated cycling from dipping into liquid gases at a temperature of approximately 100 C and back into a liquid gas for a temperature excursion range of about 200 C or more. Additionally, it has been found that the polyimides withstand short temperature excursion up to 350 C to 550 C without degradation of their electrical characteristics. The polyimide or poly esterimide can be applied over electrically insulating layers of e.g. silicon oxide, silicon nitride or aluminum nitride it can also be applied as an insulating layer in place of those materials. A thermoplastic polyimide, which is substantially inert, temperature resistant, capable of flowing upon heating, and having superior dielectric properties, finds application for example, as a passivation coating. Following application of the polyimide to the device, holes can be made in the polyimide, wires attached to the device and the device heated the polyimide will flow to fill the voids around the wires, thus providing a self levelling passivation coating. Because of their adhesive and dielectric properties, the polyimides or poly esterimides can be used to combine two or more layers of chips to provide multilayer semiconductor devices. The thermoplastic polyimides and poly esterimides of the invention are processible by extrusion, compression and injection molding, film casting and solution fiber spinning techniques. Because of their high elongation and toughness, they are particularly useful in thin film products such as films, enamels, adhesives, coatings and fibers. Polyimides, moreover, can be molded into parts that retain high strength at 200 C and as high as 250 C for short periods, such as, for example, during processing of graphite and glass fiber laminates. The polymers can be extruded e.g. into tubing or onto substrates such as conductive wire and can be co extruded with other polymers to prepare multilayer tubing or insulated wire which display good adhesion between layers to provide improved high temperature and electrical properties. Laminates, films and coatings display a minimum of voids or imperfections because no reaction products are formed at processing temperatures. The thermoplastic polyimides and poly esterimides have the following general properties they are molded simply by exceeding the glass transition temperature for sufficient time with application of pressure for good flow their elongation imparts good machineability with low brittleness they require no postcure to develop full high temperature properties they can be reclaimed and used as required they can be cast into film from solution using conventional casting machines, the films being useful in both supported and unsupported applications the films adhere well by heat sealing to themselves as well as to other polyimides or poly esterimides they can be solution spun into fibers to produce flame resistant, high temperature resistant fabrics they can be molded with various fillers into parts having high strength at high service temperatures and flame resistance unfilled molded parts have low coefficients of thermal expansion while glass, graphite and asbestos filled parts give still lower coefficients of thermal expansion they provide parts that wear well with low friction and molding compounds filled with graphite powder, molybdenum or tungsten disulfide or PTFE produce parts with self lubricating wear surfaces such as piston rings, valve seats, bearings, seals and thrust washers. Laminates are made in high pressure platen presses, low pressure vacuum bags or moderate pressure vacuum autoclave bags. Solutions can be used as laminating varnish to impregnate e.g. glass, graphite or quartz cloth, or glass, boron, graphite or ARAMID fibers to produce laminates with flame resistance, high temperature strength and good electrical properties which have utility in radomes, printed circuit boards, radioactive waste containers, as well as for turbine blades and structural parts which are used close to the hot engine environment. Polyimide film has good mechanical properties through a range from liquid helium temperature to 450 C. It has high tensile and impact strength and high resistance to tear initiation. Room temperature properties are comparable to those of polyester film while at 200 C, the film can be bent around a 1 4 inch 6.35 mm mandrel without breaking and at 250 C it has a tensile strength on the order of 3500 4000psi 24100 27600 kPa . The foregoing specification has described a variety of molecular configurations and applications of a polyimide, a poly esterimide and a polyamide acid. The invention is further illustrated in the following examples. All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated. Into a 250 ml, 3 neck flask fitted with a stirrer, a condenser, a Dean Stark trap, a thermometer, a thermowatch, a heating mantle and a nitrogen blanket, 3.44 grams 0.01 mole of 1,4 bis p aminocumyl benzene were charged under a nitrogen atmosphere along with 50 grams of N methyl pyrrolidone NMP . The mixture was agitated until a clear solution was obtained. Then 5.10 grams 0.01 mole of 4,4 bis 3,4 dicarboxyphenoxy diphenyl sulfide dianhydride were charged into the flask along with 77.10 grams of N methyl pyrrolidone under a nitrogen atmosphere. 0.01 grams of p toluene sulfonic acid catalyst were also charged in the flask. The reaction mixture was agitated until a clear solution was obtained and heat was applied until the reflux temperature was achieved. The reaction mixture was then maintained at reflux temperature for one hour. During this time about 50 grams of NMP was distilled off along with the water formed during the condensation reaction. The temperature of the reaction mass was then reduced to and controlled between 195 C to 198 C for about 4 hours. After completion of the reaction the heat was turned off and the reaction mass was allowed to cool to 50 C. A clear polymer solution was obtained which was poured into methanol to precipitate the polymer. The polymer was washed with fresh methanol and then dried at ambient temperature for 48 hours. The polyimide polymer was dissolved in N methylpyrrolidone to obtain a 10 solids clear solution. A film was cast on a glass plate treated with a TEFLON release agent and dried in an oven over a temperature range of 0 C to 300 C. A flexible, clear dark brown film was obtained. The glass transition temperature of the polyimide resin was determined to be 215 C by Differential Scanning Colorimetry. Using the apparatus and procedure of Example 1, 3.44 grams 0.01 mole of 1,4 bis p aminocumyl benzene were reacted with 3.2525 grams 0.01 mole of 3,3 ,4,4 benzophonetetracarboxylic dianhydride. A clear polymeric product was recovered from the reaction mixture. A 10 by weight solution of the polyimide in NMP was prepared which was cast on a pretreated glass plate and then dried in an oven over a temperature range of 0 C to 300 C. A flexible, clear dark brown film was obtained, which had a glass transition temperature of 257 C as determined by Differential Scanning Colorimetry. A 1000 ml 3 neck flask fitted with a stirrer, a condenser, a Dean Stark trap, a thermometer, a heating mantle and a nitrogen blanket was charged under a nitrogen atmosphere with 17.2 grams 0.05 mole of 1,4 bis p aminocumyl benzene along with 300 grams of N methylpyrrolidone. The mixture was agitated until a clear solution was obtained. Then 32.525 grams 0.1 mole of 3,3 ,4,4 benzophenone tetracarboxylic dianhydride in 300 grams of NMP and 22.5 grams 0.05 mole of 4,4 sulfonylbis p phenyleneoxy dianiline in 150.925 grams of NMP and 0.1 grams of p toluene sulfonic acid were charged to the reactor under a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture was agitated while heat was applied at a constant rate until the reflux temperature was achieved. The reaction mixture was held at the reflux temperature for 1 hour during which time 110 grams of NMP was distilled off along with the water that was formed during the condensation reaction. The reaction mixture was then held at a temperature of 195 C to 198 C for 4 hours after which the heating unit was turned off and the temperature was allowed to cool to 100 C. The clear polymeric reaction mixture was filtered and then poured into methanol where the polyimide polymer precipitated. The polymer was then washed with methanol and air dried for 48 hours. The polyimide was dissolved in NMP to obtain a 10 by weight solid, clear solution and a film was cast on a glass plate treated with a TEFLON release agent. The resin coated glass was dried in an oven for 45 minutes at 90 C, 20 minutes at 150 C, 20 minutes at 200 C and then 15 minutes at 300 C. A flexible, clear dark brown film was obtained. The polyimide was determined to have a glass transition temperature of 270 C by Differential Scanning Colorimetry. Using the apparatus and procedure of Example 1, 1.72 grams 0.005 mole of 1,4 bis p aminocumyl benzene were reacted with 5.1 grams 0.01 mole of bis 4,4 di 3,4 dicarboxyphenoxy phenyl sulfide dianhydride and 2.25 grams 0.005 mole of 4,4 bis p aminophenoxy diphenylsulfone. A clear polymer solution was obtained which was poured into methanol to precipitate the polymer and the polymer was washed with fresh methanol and then dried at ambient temperature for 48 hours. A 10 percent by weight solution of the resultant polyimide polymer in NMP was prepared which was cast on a pretreated glass plate and then dried at a temperature range of 0 C to 300 C. to obtain a flexible, thermoplastic, clear dark brown film which had a glass transition temperature of 213 C. obtained by Differential Scanning Colorimetry D.S.C. . Using the apparatus and procedure of Example 1, Examples 5 10 were carried out using the dianhydrides and diamines set forth in the Table below. The glass transition temperature of each such thermoplastic polymer which was obtained is also indicated in the Table. Using the apparatus and procedure of Example 1, 10.32 grams 0.03 mole of 1,4 bis p aminocumyl benzene were reacted with 19.2 grams 0.03 mole of 2,2 bis trimellitic oxyphenyl propane dianhydride. A clear polymeric product was recovered from the reaction mixture. A 10 by weight solution of the resultant poly esterimide polymer in NMP was prepared and then cast on a treated glass plate which was then dried in an oven at a temperature range of 0 C 300 C. A flexible, clear, dark brown film was obtained which had a glass transition temperature of 200 C by D.S.C. Example 11 was repeated, except that the quantity of 1,4 bis p aminocumyl benzene was cut in half and replaced by 6.75 grams 0.015 mole of 4,4 sulfonylbis p phenyleneoxy dianiline. Again, a clear polymeric product was obtained from the reaction mixture. A 10 by weight solution of the resultant copolymer esterimide polymer in NMP was prepared and then cast on a treated glass plate and subsequently dried in an oven at a temperature range of 0 C to 300 C. A flexible, clear, dark brown film was obtained which had a glass transition temperature of 205 C. In a 500 ml 3 neck flask fitted with a high torque stirrer tap water cooling bath, thermometer and nitrogen blanket, 34.4 grams 0.1 mole of 1,4 bis p aminocumyl benzene were charged along with 103.2 grams of NMP under nitrogen atmosphere. Agitation was applied to obtain a clear solution and thereafter cooling was applied so as to maintain a temperature throughout the entire operation in the range of 20 35 C. To the cooled solution, 32.59 grams of 3,3 , 4,4 benzophenone tetracarboxylic dianhydride were charged in predetermined portions along with 97.8 grams of NMP in predetermined portions so as to maintain 25 solids concentration at any given time, under a nitrogen atmosphere, while continuing agitation at a constant steady speed. The addition was completed in about 35 minutes time and then the reaction mass was allowed to agitate at room temperature for 16 hours to achieve completion of the reaction. Thereafter, the resultant polyamic acid was pressure filtered under nitrogen atmosphere and stored in a polypropylene bottle at 0 5 C. A 20 gram portion of the polyamic acid was mixed with 10 grams of DMAC and this solution was then spread on a treated glass plate and subsequently subjected to a cure schedule in a forced air oven as follows Example 13 was repeated, except half of the 1,4 bis p aminocumyl benzene was replaced with 22.5 grams of 4,4 sulphenylbis p phenylenoxy dianiline. After workup in the same manner, the resultant copolyimide polymer film exhibited a glass transition temperature of 273 C by D.M.C.
