# Pressure sensor with semi conductor diaphragm.

## Abstract
Provided is a pressure sensor of semiconductor type, having a semiconductor diaphragm 41 , wherein the dia phragm comprises at least one of thin wall parts 43 and at least one of thick wall parts 44 , and defines therein recesses 42 formed in the lower surface of the diaphragm below the thin wall parts, piezoresistance elements 47, 48 are laid on the upper surface of the diaphragm near or in the thin wall parts, and a supporting member 45 is sealingly jointed to the thick wall parts 44 at the lower surface of the diaphragm, thereby the recesses 42 are sealed and con fined so as to prevent high pressure fluid from blowing off when the thin wall part 43 is broken.
