# Microwave plasma etching apparatus.

## Abstract
In a microwave plasma etching apparatus wherein the surface of a sample 10 is exposed to a plasma generated by microwave discharge, thereby to subject the sample surface to an etching processing the sample 10 is transported while revolving along a circular orbit in a plasma exposure region E , and the section of the plasma exposure region E is put into the shape of a fan whose pivot coincides with the central point C of the circular orbit, whereby enhancement of the etching processing capability and uniformity of the etching speed are achieved.
