# A micro strip antenna.

## Abstract
A linear polarization strip antenna which comprises a dielectric substrate 60 whose backside is fitted with a conductive ground film, a power supply strip line 64 which is formed of a conductive film and on the surface of the dielectric substrate 60 , and a linear polarization radiation element 66 . The strip line 64 and radiation element 66 are electromagnetically coupled together. A diode 70 is connected between a top end of the strip line 64 and a ground terminal. The top end of the strip line 64 is selectively set at an open or grounded state according to the conductive state of the diode 70 to vary the mode of electromagnetic coupling between the strip line 64 and radiation element 66 , thereby changing the direction in which the radiated electromagnetic wave is polarized.
