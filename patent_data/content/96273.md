# A DEVICE FOR ADJUSTING THE MUTUAL INCLINATION BETWEEN BACK AND SEAT IN AN ARM CHAIR, DECK CHAIR OR THE LIKE

## Abstract
The invention relates to a device for adjusting and fixing the back 8 and the seat 9 of an arm chair, deck chair or the like to a supporting structure 1 allowing said back and seat to continuously reach different positions of reciprocal incli nation ranging between two end inclinations respectively corresponding to a minimum and a maximum inclination. In order to allow the user to vary the inclination between seat 9 and back 8 without removing his bust from the supporting surface and with a very little effort, the back 8 is supported and fixed in a rotary way around a horizontal axis 12 fixed with respect to said supporting structure 1 , the seat 9 is fixed to the back 8 by means of hinges 10 and to the structure 1 by means of constraints 6 which support the seat and allow the same to perform predetermined translation and or rotation movements compatible with the presence of said hinges and without solutions of continuity between said end inclinations, and at least one of said constraints is braked.
