# Fibre reinforced metal matrix composites.

## Abstract
A metal matrix composite comprises essentially aligned, fine diameter inorganic oxide fibres embedded in a metal matrix material such as a light metal, for example aluminium or magnesium or an alloy thereof. In a particular embodiment the fibres are nominally continuous and preferably are of mean diameter below 5 microns. The composite can be made by liquid infiltration of a fibre preform comprising the fibres bound together with an inorganic or an organic binder or in the case of short fibres by extrusion of a mixture, for example a suspension, of the fibres and powdered metal matrix material.
