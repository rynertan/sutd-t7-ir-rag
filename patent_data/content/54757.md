# Inside powder striping apparatus.

## Abstract
This relates to a powder applicator for applying a coating stripe in powder form to inside seams of can bodies. The powder applicator is particularly adapted to be utilized in conjunction with welding apparatus for welding the side seams of can bodies and wherein the diameters of the can bodies are too small to permit the provision of the customary excess powder return duct. The powder applicator is located at the 12 00 o clock position and thus the excess powder will not merely fall out of the applicator. Accordingly, there is provided a channel defined by a porous block 32 having air or gas circulated therethrough and wherein the terminal end of the channel is closed by a deflector block 54 which will deflect any excess powder out of the applicator into an overlying hood 45 which is primarily intended to take away powder overspray which normally occurs between adjacent, but spaced, can bodies.
