# ABSORBANCE, TURBIDIMETRIC, FLUORESENCE AND NEPHELOMETRIC PHOTOMETER

## Abstract
An absorbance, turbidimetric, fluorescence, and nephe lometric photometer is constructed by providing a sample cell having a rectangular absorbance turbidimetric cross section for radiation. The cells exit aperture is positioned to be the entrance aperture for a grating which separates the light according to wavelength and impingement on an array detector.
