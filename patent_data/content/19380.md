# Apparatus for developing a latent image.

## Abstract
Apparatus 36 for developing a latent image by advancing a conductive developer composition comprising marking particles into contact therewith using developer rolls 38, 40 . The apparatus 36 interacts with the developer composition causing the developer composition to have higher and lower regions of conductivity. In the regions of high conductivity, development of the solid areas within the latent image is optimized. Development of lines within the latent image is optimized in the regions of lower conductivity.
