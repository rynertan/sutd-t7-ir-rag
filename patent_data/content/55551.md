# Output buffer circuit.

## Abstract
The output buffer circuit is capable of taking three output states, high level, low level and high impedance. The buffer circuit includes a detector circuit Zener diode D3, resistors R5 and R6, and transistor Q5 for detecting power source voltage Vcc applied to the buffer circuit. When the power source voltage becomes high e.g. 7V the detector circuit D3, R5, R6, Q5 switches the buffer circuit to high impedance output state diode D3 is turned ON, so that transistor Q5 is turned ON to connect the collector of a transistor Q2 to ground G and to turn the output stage transistors Q3, Q2, Q4 OFF .
