# A pinion gear carriage in a planetary gear mechanism.

## Abstract
A pinion gear support carriage 3 for a planetary gear arrangement in an automatic transmission includes a first lubrication conduit 14a, 2c, 2d leading radially from a sun gear 14 to the needle bearings 5 of a plurality of pinion gear shafts 4 . Pair of thrust washers 7, 8 between the pinion gear 6 and the carriage frame 3 have cut outs at their centers that overlap to create subsidiary lubrication conduits between the first lubrication conduit and the needle bearings.
