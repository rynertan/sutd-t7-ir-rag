# A method for conveying a weft thread by means of a flowing fluid through the weaving shed in a shuttleless weaving machine, as well as weaving machine adapted for applying said method.

## Abstract
The invention aims at equalizing weft time differences when launching successive threads and thereby obtaining a more uniform cloth. For that purpose the thread velocity in the initial phase of the weft is measured and on the basis thereof an additional pressure impulse of the conveying fluid may be supplied to the thread. According to a different possibility, in dependence on the measured value, the thread is more or less braked by means of a brake at the end of the weft phase.
