# Zeolite catalyst preparation.

## Abstract
Zeolites, e.g. ZSM 5, are prepared under controlled conditions of pH adjustment with an acid, SiO2 Al2O3 mole ratio, and in the substantial absence of alkali metal cations, such zeolites are useful for synthesizing olefins from methanol and or dimethyl ether.
