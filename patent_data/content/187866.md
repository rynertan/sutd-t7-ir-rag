# SURFACE ULTRASONIC WAVE INTERFERENCE MICROSCOPE.

## Abstract
A transmitting, focusing, ultrasonic wave transducer 20 is excited by high frequency pulses sent from a high frequency pulse generator 1 the leakage elastic surface waves are excited in a sample 6 by the focusing ultrasonic wave beams of the transducer 20 the waves emitted again are received by a receiving focusing ultrasonic wave trans ducer 24 the received signals are sent to a mixer 23 where a difference in phase is detected relative to reference signals produced from a high frequency oscillator 18 in the high frequency pulse generator 1 and the detected output is supplied as a display signal to a display 9 or 14 . The transducers 20, 24 and the sample 6 are relatively moved by a moving device 7 or 10 two dimensionally on a plane parallel to the surface of the sample or at right angles to the surface of the sample. In synchronism with this movement, the surface of the display 9 or 14 is swept to obtain an ultrasonic microscopic image or a V z curve on the display surface.
