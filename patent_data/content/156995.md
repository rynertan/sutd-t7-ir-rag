## Description
ALUMINUM LITHIUM ALLOY 3 jBa jkgyQuiid of the Invention The present invention re√¨stes to aluminium lithium lithium alloys filly more particularly to an aluminum lithium alloy composition with good fracture toughness and high strength. It has been estimated that current large commercial transport aircraft may be able to save from 15 to 20 gallons of fuel per year for every pound of weight that can be saved when building the aircraft. Over the projected 20 year life of an airplane, this savings amounts to 300 to 400 gallons of fuel. At current fuel costs, a significant investinent to reduce the structure weight of the aircraft can be made to improve overall economic efficiency of the aircraft. The need for improved performance in aircraft of various types can be satisfied by the use of improved engines, improved airframe design, and improved or new structural materials in the aircraft. Improvements in engines and aircraft design have pushed the limits of these technologies. However, the development of new and improved structural materials is now receiving increased attention, and is expected to yield further gains in performance. Materials have always played an important role in dietating aircraft structural concepts. In the early part of this century, aircraft structure was composed of wood, primarily spruce, arid fabric. Because shortages of spruce developed in the early part of the century, lightweight metal alloys began to be used as aircraft structural materials. At about the same tinkle, improvements in design brought about the development of the all metal cantilevered wing. It was not until the 1930 s, however, that the metal skin wing design became standard, and firmly established metals, prirnarily aluminum alloys, as the major airframe structural material.Since that time, aircraft structural materials have remained rernarkably consistent with aluminum structural materials being used primarily in the wing, body and empennage, arid with steel comprising the material for the landing gear and certain other speciality applications requiring very high strength materials. Several new materials are currently being developed for incorporation into aircraft structure. These include new metallic materials, metal matrix composites and resin matrix composites. It is believed that improved aluminum alloys and carbon fiber composites will dominate aircraft structural materials in the coming decades. While composites will be used in increased percentages as aircraft structural materials, new lightweight aluminum alloys, and especially aluminum lithium alloys show great promise for extending the usefulness of aluminum alloys. Heretofore, aluminum lithium alloys have been used only sparsely in aircraft structure. The relatively low use has been caused by casting difficulties associated with aluminum lithium alloys and by their relatively low fracture toughness compared to other more conventional aluminum alloys.Aluminum lithium alloys, however, provide a substantial lowering of the density of aluminum alloys as well as a relatively high strength to weight ratio , which has been found to be very important in decreasing the overall weight of structural materials used in an aircraft. While substantial strides have been made in improving the aluminum lithium processing technology, a major challenge still outstanding is an ability to obtain a good blend of fracture toughness and high strength in an aluminum lithium alloy. Summary of the Invention The present invention provides a novel aluminum alloy composition that can be worked and heat treated so as to provide an aluminum lithium alloy with high strength, good fracture toughness, and relatively low density compared to conventional aluminum alloys that it is intended to replace. An alloy prepared in accordance with the present invention has a nominal composition on the order of 2.2 weight percent lithium, 0.7 percent magnesium, 2.5 percent copper and 0.12 percent zirconium. By underaging the alloy at a low temperature, an excellent combination of fracture toughness and high strength results. Detailed Description of the Invention An aluminum lithium alloy formulated in accordance with the present invention can contain from about 2.0 to about 2.4 percent lithium, 0 to 0.9 percent magnesium, 2.3 to 2.7 percent copper and a maximum of 0.15 percent zirconium as a grain refiner. Preferably from 0.10 to 0.15 percent zirconium is incorporated. All percentages herein are by weight percent based on the total weight of the alloy unless otherwise indicated. While no magnesium need be employed in the alloy, it is preferred that magnesium be included to increase strength without increasing density. Magnesium also provides solid solution strengthening. Preferred ainotints of magnesium range from 0.5 to 0.9 percent, with 0.7 percent being more preferred. The copper adds strength to the alloy. Iron and silicon can each be present in maximums up to a total of 0.3 percent. It is preferred that these elements be present only in trace amounts, limiting the iron to a maximum of 0.15 percent and the silicon to a maximum of 0.12 percent, and preferably maximums of 0.10 and 0.10 percent respectively. Certain trace elements such as zinc, may be present in the amounts up to, but not to exceed, 0.25 percent of the total. Other elements such as chromium and manganese must be held to levels of 0.05 percent or below.If these maximums are exceeded, the desired properties of the aluminum lithium alloy will tend to deteriorate.The trace elements sodium and hydrogen are also thought to be harmful to the properties fracture toughness in particular of aluminum lithium alloys and should be held to the lowest levels practically attainable, for example on the order of 15 to 30 ppm 0.0015 0.0030 wt. for the sodium and less than 15 ppm 0.0015 wt. 6 and preferably less than 1.0 ppm 0.0001 wt. u for the hydrogen. The balance of the alloy, of course, comprises aluminum. An aluminum lithium alloy formulated in the proportions set forth in the foregoing paragraph is processed into an article utilizing known techniques. The alloy is formulated in molten form and cast into an ingot. The ingot is then homogenized at temperatures ranging from 9250 F to 10000 F. Thereafter, the alloy is converted into a usable article by conventional mechanical formation techniques such as rolling, extrusion or the like. Once an article is formed, the alloy is normally subjected to a solution treatment at temperatures ranging from 9500 F to 10000 F, quenched in a quenching medium such as water that is maintained at a temperature on the order of 700 F to 1500 F. If the alloy has been rolled or extruded, it is generally stretched on the order of 1 to 3 percent of its original length to relieve internal stresses. The alumium alloy can then be further worked and formed into the various shapes for its final application. Additional heat treatments such as solution heat treatment can be employed if desired. For example, an extruded product after being cut to desired length are generally solution heat treated at temperatures on the order of 9750 F for I to 4 hours. The product is tllen quenched in a quenching medium held at temperatures ranging from about 700 F to 1500 F. Thereafter, in accordance with tlie present invention, the article is preferably subjected to an aging treatment at relatively low temperatures on the order of from 200 to 3000 F. Since this alloy is intended to replace conventional 7XXX series type alloys, it is preferred that the alloy be aged for a period of time that will allow it to achieve at least about 95 percent of its peak strength.It is preferred that the alloy be aged for a period of time allowing it to achieve 95 to 97 percent of its peak strength. Preferred aging temperatures range from 250 to 2750 F. Within these temperature ranges, 95 to 97 percent peak age can be achieved by aging from about 4 to 120 hours. Example The following example is presented to illustrate the superior characteristics of an aluminum lithium alloy aged in accordance with the present invention and to assist one of ordinary skill in making and using the present invention. Moreover, it is intended to illustrate the signifcantly improved and unexpected characteristics of an aluminum lithium alloy formulated and manufactured in accordance with the paramters of the present invention. The following example is not intended in any way to otherwise limit the scope of this disclosure or the protection granted by Letters Patent hereon. An aluminum alloy containing 2.2 lithium, 0.5 percent magnesium, 2.5 percent copper, 0.1 percent zirconium with the balance being aluminum was formulated. The trace elements present in the formulation constituted less than 0.25 percent of the total. The iron and silicon present in the formulation constituted less than 0.07 percent of the formulation. The alloy was cast and homogenized at about 9750 F. Thereafter, the alloy was hot rolled to a thickness of 0.2 inches. The resulting sheet was then solution treated at about 9750 F for about 1 hour. It was then quenched in water maintained at about 700 F. Thereafter, the sheet was subjected to a stretch of 1 1 2 percent of its initial length. The material was then cut into specimens. The specimens were cut to a size of 0.5 inch by 2 1 2 inch by 0.2 inch for the precrack Charpy impact tests, which measure fracture toughness. The specimens prepared for the tensile strength tests were 1 inch by 4 inches by 0.2 inches. A plurality of specimerls were then aged for 120 hours at 2750 F. Each of the specimens aged at each of the temperatures and times were then subjected to the tensile strength and precrack Charpy impact tests in accordance with standard ASTM testing procedures. The specimens underaged at 2750 F exhibit an ultimate strength ranging from about 865 ksi to about 95 ksi with a toughness on the order of 220 to 280 in lbs in2.
