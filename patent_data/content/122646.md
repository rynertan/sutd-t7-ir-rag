# Process for separating off calcium nitrate tetrahydrate by crystallization.

## Abstract
Separating Ca NO₃ ₂.4H₂O from a nitrophosphate diges tion liquor by crystallization, wherein Ca NO₃ ₂.4H₂O seeding material with a particle size smaller than 100 µm is added to this liquor at a temperature of 0,1 2 C lower than the saturation temperature, the resulting liquor is batchwise cooled, and the Ca NO₃ ₂.4H₂O crystallized out is separated from the cooled liquor. The Ca NO₃ ₂.4H₂O is substantially crystallized out with out excessive cooling as very coarse and uniform particles which can be easily separated out.
