# Pressure applied type semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A pressure applied type semiconductor device, in which a metal stamp 46 for urging a semiconductor body 10 is formed with a peripheral annular groove 48 . When press ure is applied, the groove 48 is elastically deformed. Thus, stress concentration in the semiconductor body 10 directly under the edge of the metal stamp 46 can be alleviated.
