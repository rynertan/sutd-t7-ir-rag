# CLOSURE SEAL FOR HIGH PRESSURE VESSEL CLOSURE SEAL FOR HIGH PRESSURE VESSEL

## Abstract
Sealing between an access opening 15 in a pressure ves sel 11 and a closure member 20 fitted in the openings is pro vided by an O ring 38 of perfluoroelastomer in an annular groove 39 formed in a surface of the closure member. The sidewall 42 of the groove on the low pressure side of the seal has a concave curvature in cross section so as to form a hook or lip which retains the O ring in the groove and prevents creep ing extrusion of the O ring under prolonged exposure to high temperature and pressure fluid on the high pressure side of the seal, even with a clearance between the closure member and the access opening of up to approximately 1 percent of the di ameter of the O ring cross section.
