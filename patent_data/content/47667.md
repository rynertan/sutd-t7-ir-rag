# Automatic transmission with overdrive device.

## Abstract
An automatic transmission including a torque conver ter comprising an impeller connected to the crankshaft of an internal combustion engine and arranged to pump oil to drive a turbine, an automatic transmission apparatus com prising a planetary gear device and fluid operated brake and clutch devices connected to the output shaft of the turbine, an oil pump driven by the impeller through an oil pump drive shaft for producing a pressure oil applied to the fluid oper ated brake and clutch devices, and a final reduction gear device connected to an output shaft of the automatic trans mission apparatus. An overdrive device comprising an over drive clutch and overdrive gears is connected between the oil pump drive shaft and an intermediate shaft. The inter mediate shaft is connected between an output shaft of the overdrive gears and the final reduction gear device, and valve means is provided for supplying oil to the overdrive clutch to cause it to engage.
