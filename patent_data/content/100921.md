# Apparatus and method for testing lens structure.

## Abstract
Apparatus and method for testing the optical throughput or efficiency of lens structures adapted to be used in pairs to make a connection between optical fibers by imaging one fiber end, serving as input, via the connector pair into the end of the other fiber end, serving as output. The apparatus comprises structure by which the output beam of a nominal ly perfect connector half is presented to a lens structure under test while a reflecting surface simulating a fiber end is positioned in the test structure under conditions of actual use. The simulating beam is focused by the test lens structure onto the reflecting surface after which it is reflected along a path travelling oppositely to its entering direction. Structure is provided for comparing the energy content of the beam emerging from the test lens structure with that presented to it whereby the optical efficiency of the lens structure is determined.
