## Description
The invention relates to a charge coupled device comprising a charge transport channel defined at a surface of a semiconductor body and an input stage for supplying signal dependent charge packets comprising an input diode for supplying charge carriers, a first electrode arranged above the charge transport channel for forming a charge packet having a fixed signal independent size and second, third and fourth electrodes located above the charge transport channel, the second, third and fourth electrodes being connected to means for applying voltages in such a manner that a potential well extending below these electrodes is induced, to which the charge packet having a fixed size is transferred, these means comprising a voltage source, by means of which a signal dependent voltage difference is applied between the second and the fourth electrode, as a result of which signal dependent quantities of charge are stored below the second and the fourth electrode, from which complementary charge packets are formed by applying such a voltage to the third electrode that below this electrode a potential barrier is formed, which insulates the charge packets below the second and the fourth electrode from each other. Such a charge coupled device is known, for example, from the publication A symmetrical Balanced Linear Differential Charge Splitting Input for Charge coupled Devices of Carlo H. Séquin In this configuration, in order to be transferred from one the vertical part to the other horizontal part, the charge has to pass a narrow channel, whose width is determined by the length of the second and fourth electrodes. Due to the fact that in charge coupled devices the width to length ratio is generally considerably larger than 1, the charge transport from the vertical part to the horizontal part involves a considerable decrease of speed. This means that in general the frequency at which this device can be operated lies considerably lower than the frequency at which the normal charge transport in the horizontal part could be effected. The transport from the vertical part to the horizontal part could be accelerated by making the lengths of the second and fourth electrodes considerably greater. However, such an increase in length would have a speed reducing effect on the horizontal part. The invention has The invention is based on the recognition of the fact that the signal dependent charge packet formed below the said second electrode and no longer transported for further signal processing through the charge coupled device can be transferred back to the region below the first electrode. A charge coupled device according to the invention is characterized in that the said electrodes are disposed one to four in a consecutive arrangement in such a manner that the second electrode is located between the first and third electrodes, and in that the first electrode is connected to voltage means applying voltages such that the charge packet formed below the second electrode is transferred back to the region below the first electrode before a charge packet having a fixed size is formed again below this electrode. Due to the fact that the excess charge packet is stored again below the first electrode, this charge packet need not be drained separately. The electrodes can now all be arranged consecutively, as a result of which the reductions in speed described above are avoided. An important preferred embodiment is characterized in that the signal dependent voltage difference between the second and the fourth electrode is obtained from a signal S, which is supplied in the form S to one of the said electrodes and in the form S to the other of the said electrodes. The invention will be described more fully with reference to an embodiment and the accompanying diagrammatic drawing, in which The invention will be described hereinafter with reference to an n channel device, but it will be appreciated without further explanation that the invention can also be used for p channel devices. The device comprises a semiconductor body 1 of, for example, silicon having at least a surface region 3 of the The surface 2 above the charge transport channel is covered with a thin dielectric layer 6 of, for example, silicon oxide and or silicon nitride or another suitable material or of a combination of suitable dielectric materials. In the case in which the device belongs to the type of devices having a buried channel bccd or pccd , a thin As appears from the plan view of Fig. 1, the charge transport channel has a part of larger width and a part of smaller width. The wide part is associated with the input, which will be described more fully. The part of smaller width forms the actual charge transport channel between the input and the output not shown . The charge transport in this part is controlled by 4 phase clock voltages Ø₁, Ø₂, Ø₃ and Ø₄, which are applied to the clock electrodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 2 provided on the oxide layer 6. The input stage comprises an n surface zone 16, which is provided in the There are arranged between the input diode 16 and the clock electrode 8 four electrodes 18 21, which will be designated hereinafter as first, second, third and fourth electrode and which have the following functions the first electrode, The electrodes 19, 20 and 21 serve to divide the said charge packet having a fixed size into two complementary signal dependent charge packets. These charge packets are formed by the electrodes 19 and 21 and are separated from each other by means of the electrode 20. For this purpose, a voltage dependent upon the signal S to be supplied is applied between the electrodes 19 and 21. This is indicated diagrammatically in Fig. 1 by the source 25, whose positive terminal is connected to the electrode 19 and whose negative terminal is connected to the electrode 21. Of course, the voltage source 25 may also be connected in the opposite sense or one of its terminals may be connected to a fixed voltage. The electrode 20 is clocked with the clock voltage Ø₁. The operation of the charge coupled device is described with reference to the potential diagrams shown in Fig. 4, which occur in the charge transport channel upon application of the clock voltages according to Fig. 3a. Fig. 4a shows diagrammatically for the location in the diagram the input stage of the device and the part of the succeeding charge transport channel 4. As usual, the positive potential is plotted in downward direction. The potential level below the electrodes at a voltage of 0 V at the electrodes is indicated in the diagrams by the broken line and is designated below as reference level. It is assumed that the semiconductor body 1 or at least the surface region 3 is applied to a negative voltage of, for example, 3.5 V. The clock voltages Ø It should be noted that the potential levels below the electrodes 19 and 21 are indicated slightly differently due to the signal S to be converted. At the instant t₂, Ø At t₃, the input diode has arrived at the most positive level. At the same time, Ø₁ has become positive, while Ø₄ has returned to 0 V. The packet 29 is transferred at least in part to the potential well below the electrode 20. The charge packets 27 and 28 are shifted one position with respect to the situation at t₂. At t₄, Ø₄ is negative. Below the electrodes connected to Ø₄ a potential barrier has now been formed. The charge 29, which was stored at t₁, t₂ below the electrode 18, is now present below the electrode 20. At the same time, the potential wells in which the packets 27 and 28 are stored have extended to beneath the clock electrodes 10, 14. At t₅, Ø₁ has fallen again to 0 V so that the charge packets 27, 28 are stored below the electrodes 10 and 14 connected to Ø₂ and are again shifted one position with respect to the situation at t₃. The charge packet 29 can extend over a potential well, which covers the area below the electrodes 19, 20 and 21. The quantity of charge stored below the electrodes 19 and 21 in this situation depends upon the depth of the potential well below the electrodes 19 and 21, respectively, and hence upon the value of the signal S. From the instant t₅, Ø₁ becomes negative, as a result of which the potential level below the electrode 20 increases and the charge that was stored below the electrode 20 is distributed over the potential wells below the electrodes 19 and 21. At the instant t₆, the charge packet 29 is subdivided into two charge packets 30 and 31, which are separated from each other by the potential barrier 32 below the electrode 20. The sizes of the charge packets 30 and 31 are complementary and dependent upon the signal S. In the present embodiment, in which, by way of example, the level below the electrode 19 is indicated to be slightly higher than below the electrode 21, the charge packet 30 will be largest. At the next stage of operation, only the charge packet 30 will be transported further through the charge transport channel. At the instant t₇, Ø₄ is 0 V. The charge packet 31 is thus transferred at least in part back to the region below the electrode 18, while the charge packet 30 extends below the clock electrode 8, which is also clocked with Ø₄. The charge packet 30 can be transported further through the charge transport channel 4 in the same manner as the charge packets 27 and 28. The charge packet 31 is not drained, but is added to the excess quantity of charge carriers which are supplied by the input diode 16 at the beginning of the new cycle for the formation of a new charge packet 29 having a fixed size. Due to the fact that the charge packet 31 does not require a separate drain, below which the electrode can be retransferred, the electrodes 18 21 can be arranged consecutively in a row and ramifications in the charge transport channel, whereby angles are introduced into the charge transport, can be avoided. The device is therefore particularly suitable for high frequency applications. It should be noted that the conversion of the signal S into a corresponding charge packet takes place at the edge of the clock Ø₁ around the instant t₆ and hence is frequency independent. When therefore the time intervals in which the clocks Ø₁ ... Ø₄ are constant become smaller, this will not influence the signal formation with an unchanged slope of the edge of the clocks. Fig. 3b shows a function of time high frequency clocks Ø As appears from the plan view, the input part of the channel 4 is wider than the succeeding part of the channel. In this manner, it can be achieved that, even though only a part of the fixed charge packet 29 is used for the further signal processing, nevertheless a larger relative part of the charge storage capacity of the channel is utilized. Instead of by a wider input part, this may also be obtained in a different manner, for example by a suitable choice of the voltages applied in the input part. It will be appreciated that the invention is not limited to the embodiment described herein, but that many variations are possible for those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, in the embodiment described herein, the difference between two signals may also be converted into a charge packet by supplying one signal to the electrode 19 and the other signal to the electrode 21.
