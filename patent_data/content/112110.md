# In mold label dispenser for blow molding machine.

## Abstract
An in mold label dispenser 22 for a blow molding machine is disclosed as including a dispensing head 56 mounted for rectilinear movement along a first axis A between a label magazine 48 and an open mold 28 and having a label carrier 58 mounted on the dispensing head for rectilinear movement between retracted and extended positions along a second axis B transverse to the first axis A. Rectilinear movement of the dispensing head 56 along the first axis A and coordinated extending and retracting recti linear movement of the label carrier 58 along axis B transfers a label 50 from the magazine 48 to the mold 28 in preparation for the blow molding operation. The label dispenser 22 has particular utility when provided with a pair of the label carriers 58 to simultaneously transfer a pair of labels 50 to the open mold 28 within the confined space limitations involved. A drive linkage 66 is driven by a first gear unit 72 to reciprocally move the dispensing head 56 , while a second gear unit 106 rotatably drives elongated supports 92 which mount the dispensing head 56 for its rectilinear movement and drive cams 108 that move the label carriers 58 . Both the first and second gear units 72, 106 are driven by a common input 156 to coordinate the movement of the dispensing head 56 with the movement of the label carriers 58 .
