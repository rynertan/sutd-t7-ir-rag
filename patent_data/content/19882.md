# Semiconductor integrated circuit device with non volatile semiconductor memory cells.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a metal oxide semiconductor integrated circuit device having an array of electrically rewritable, insulated gate type non volatile semi conductor memory cells 14, 16 formed on a semi conductor substrate 10 , read write mode setting circuit 30 and address designating circuits 24, 26 arranged corresponding to the memory cell array 14, 16 , those circuits being fabricated on the substrate, and a field insulating layer 12 formed on the substrate 10 . A cut portion 34 is formed in the field insulating layer to surround the memory cell array 14, 16 .
