# IC Card and an identification system thereof.

## Abstract
A plurality of secret data for identifying IC cards is stored in a memory which is provided in an IC circuit incor porated in the IC card 11 . When an IC card 11 is supplied to an issuer from a manufacturer, a sealed sheet 17 on which a production master key PMK data is printed is separately sent to the issuer from the manufacturer. The PMK data printed on the sealed sheet 17 is supplied to the IC card 11 to be compared with a PMK data stored therein. The entrance of a primary account number PAN data to the IC card is allowed only when a coincidence signal is ob tained. An initialization personal identification number IPIN data is printed on a sealed sheet 27 which is sepa rately sent to a card holder from the issuer. At the card holders stage, the IPIN data and an IPIN data stored in the IC card 11 are compared with each other. The registration of the personal identification number to the IC card 11 may be performed only when a coincidence signal is obtained.
