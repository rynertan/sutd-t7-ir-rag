# Method of producing MOSFET type semiconductor device.

## Abstract
In the production of an MOS transistor or a one MOS transistor one capacitor memory cell, a gate electrode 14 is made of aluminum, doped regions 15, 16 are formed by an ion implatation method using the gate electrode as a mask, and the doped regions are annealed by a laser beam.
