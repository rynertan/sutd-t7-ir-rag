# Communications system and central station therefor.

## Abstract
A communications system and network wherein com nunications links between subscriber station S1 S9 32,34 are established by retrodirective oscillating loops 10 22 42, 44 between each subscriber station and one or more nodes N₁ N₄ 36 . Information is transmitted between sub scribers by using a mixing process in the nodes whereby information transmitted from one subscriber station to a node is transferred at the node to a carrier signal trans mitted between the node and another subscriber station, possibly via at least one other node. A satellite node ST may be provided to establish links 16, 18 between nodes N₂, N₃ , so that remotely located subscribers can communicate.
