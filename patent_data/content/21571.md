## Description
Oil Dispersants THIS INVENTION relates to oil dispersants. Oil spillages which occur at sea present environmental problems in that the oil may for example spread as an oil slick and drift onto beaches thus contaminating them or may affect wild life for example sea birds. It may be necessary to disperse such spillages and for this purpose oil dispersants may be applied to them such dispersants may also be used for example in cleaning tanks which are contaminated with oil or similar substances. This invention comprises oil dispersants which comprise 1 at least one compound which comprises at least 3, preferably 3 100 and more preferably 4 to 20 polyglycol residues each of which residues comprises 10 40 and preferably 10 25 propylene oxide residues and 3 40 and preferably 5 25 ethylene oxide residues and having 15 60 propylene and ethylene oxide residues in total per polyglycol residue. 2 a non ionic surfactant which is a condensation product of product of propylene oxide and or ethylene oxide with an alcohol having 10 20 and preferably 12 18 carbon atoms, an alkyl phenol preferably a p alkyl phenol, having a total of 4 16 carbon atoms in its alkyl group or groups, a carboxylic acid having 10 20 and preferably 12 18 carbon atoms, or an amine or amide having 10 20 and preferably 12 18 carbon atoms, the amine, amide, carboxylic acid or alcohol preferably being a saturated aliphatic compound which preferably comprises a straight chain with at most 2 carbon atoms in side chains or an aliphatic compound as aforesaid which comprises at most two carbon to carbon double bonds, the alcohol, acid, amide or amine having two or preferably one functional groups each of which is condensed with from 2 20 propylene and or ethylene oxide groups, the ratio of propylene oxide to ethylene oxide residues being preferably in the ratio 1 10 to 10 1 and, 3 a solvent for compounds 1 and 2 which is miscible with oil.

This test method was used in Examples 1 10. 1.5 litres of a 3.5 wt 7. solution of sodium chloride were placed in a 4 litre capacity beaker. 1 ml of weathered Kuwait crude oil was placed on the surface of the water. Dispersant was added to the oil on the surface via a syringe and the system allowed to stand for 2 minutes on a table attached to a flask shaker, the table being able to be rocked at varying speeds to simulate wave motion. The beaker was rocked at slow speed approximately 60 movements a minute for up to 30 minutes and observations were made at intervals on the behaviour of the oil.

The following evaluations of compositions in dispersing an oil slick were carried out in accordance with the Department ofIndustry, Warren Spring Laboratory, Report No. tR152 ES A method of Testing Oil Dispersant Chemicals at Sea The evaluation took place at sea under wind force 2 5, salinity by salinometer of 3.5 wt and a sea temperature of 2 50C. The boat from which the oil was spread travelled at 6 knots hour and was fitted with a projecting boon equipped with two nozzles.The first nozzle sprayed a Kuwait crude oil onto the surface of the sea and was followed by the second nozzle which sprayed a mixture of sea water and dispersant onto the oil slick so produced. A surface breaker board was towed after the boat so as to create a turbulent surface condition and so facilitate dispersion of the oil. The rate of oil flow and the rate of dispersant sea water flow were fixed at 4 gallons minute. The ratio of dispersant to sea water could be varied until interference patterns were noted on the surface of the water by an observer boat following behind, indicating incomplete dispersion of the oil.
