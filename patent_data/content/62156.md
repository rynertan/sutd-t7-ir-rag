# Metal porcelain dental restoration.

## Abstract
A baked metal porcelain dental restoration is provided, including a method of making same. The restoration includes a substrate formed from a non cast thin metal foil having a textured exterior surface onto which a dental porcelain jacket is directly bonded without any intermediate interface compositions. The exterior of the porcelain jacket may be configured as necessary to provide a desired occlusal surface. The dental restoration is made by providing a support post with a configuration that corresponds to the shape of a tooth base in a patient s mouth. The support post is coated with a thin spacing layer. A thin metal foil is swaged around the coated support post to substantially conform to the shape of the post. The exterior of the foil substrate is textured and porcelain powder is applied thereto without the use of any intermediate interface composition between the foil and powder. The metal substrate and applied powder are baked to bond the porcelain directly to the metal foil. The porcelain exterior is then finished as prescribed to provide the desired occlusal relationship with other teeth.
