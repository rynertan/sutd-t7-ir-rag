# Arrangement comprising a cryogenic refrigerator and an insulated enclosure, and an assembly including such an arrangement.

## Abstract
A cryogenic refrigerator of the type having a fixed orifice 24 and a variable orifice 18, 20 is characterized in that when it is operated in an insulated enclosure the temperature falls even after the variable orifice has closed. When correctly designed such a cryogenic refrigerator will reach its desired operating temperature range quickly and will remain in the lower part of this range with the variable orifice closed until the pressure of the compressed gas supply to the cryogenic refrigerator falls to about one half its initial value whereupon the variable orifice will open to provide additional refrigeration.
