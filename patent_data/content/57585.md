# A DEVELOPER MIXTURE

## Abstract
A developer mixture 62 for developing an electrosta tic latent image comprises magnetic carrier granule 74 having toner particles 76 adhering triboelectrically thereto. The toner particles 76 comprise a non magnetic portion with a magnetic portion integral therewith. The magnetic portion of a toner particle 76 is from about 1 to about 10 , preferably about 10 of the volume of the toner particle. Apparatus and method for developing an electro static latent image using the developer mixture are also disclosed.
