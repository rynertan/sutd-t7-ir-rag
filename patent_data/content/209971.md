## Description
ANTIBIOTIC A80438 AND PROCESS FOR ITS PRODUCTION This invention relates to the new polyether antibiotic A80438 and to its production by the cultivation of certain novel microorganisms of the Streptomyces species. Improved antibiotics continue to be needed in the veterinary field. Enhancing growth promotion in animals is one desired feature of such antibiotics.Growth promotion can be achieved by reducing disease and by increasing feed utilization efficiency. Coccidiosis is a serious problem for the poultry industry. Coccidiosis results from infection by one or more species of Eimeria or Isopora. Improved anticoccidial agents are in demand because of the continuing economic losses due to coccidiosis. Promoting growth by increasing feed utilization efficiency is another ecomonically desirable objective of veterinary science. Of particular interest is growth promotion in ruminants, such as cattle. The mechanism for utilizing the major nutritive portion carbohydrates of ruminant feeds is well known. Microorganisms in the rumen of the animal degrade carbohydrates to produce monosaccharides and then convert these monosaccharides to pyruvate compounds. Pyruvates are metabolized by microbiological processes to form acetates, butyrates or propionates, collectively known as volatile fatty acids VFA . The relative efficiency of VFA utilization is connected to overall efficiency. Thus, although acetates and butyrates are used, propionates are used with greater efficiency. Also, the fermentation efficiency of propionate production is greater than that of butyrate or acetate. This is in addition to the utilization efficiency. A beneficial compound, therefore, stimulates animals to produce a higher proportion of propionates from carbohydrates, thereby increasing carbohydrate utilization efficiency. A80438 is a new member of the group of polyether antibiotics. Westley John W. Westley, ÂµPolyether Antibiotics Naturally Occurring Acid Ionophores, Vol.2, Chemistry, Marcel Dekker, New York, 1983 has separated existing polyethers by class and type. UsingWestley s system, A80438 is a new member of theClass la, type 2 , group of polyethers. Examples of other members of this group are lonomycin also called emericid, A218, RP 31559 and DE 3936 see U.S. Patent 3,950,514 , monensin U.S. Patent 3,501,568 , nigericin and laidlomycin. According to the invention there is provided a new polyether antibiotic A80438 of formula 1 EMI2.1 and its acyl, alkyl ester, alkyl ether urethane derivatives and the salts thereof. Thus, in one aspect, this invention providesA80438 urethane derivatives which are believed to have formula 2 EMI3.1 wherein R is CONHR1 and R1 is alkyl, aryl, alkyl aryl, arylalkyl, haloaryl, nitroaryl, haloarylalkyl, alkoxyaryl, aryloxyaryl, arylcycloalkyl, acylaryl and cycloalkyl and salts of these derivatives. A80438 is a useful antibacterial and anticoccidial agent. It improves feed utilization efficiency in ruminants and acts as a growth promotant in ruminants and in monogastric animals. In addition,A80438 has insecticidal, inotropic and antiviral activity. Further, A80438 is useful as an ionophore. A80438 in its sodium salt form has the following characteristics State white crystals from acetone water mp 160 162 C. pKa 5.2 66 aqueous dimethylformamide la 25D 1020 c 1, CHC13 Molecular weight 820 by field desorption mass spectrometry FDMS Empirical formula C43H74 O13Na W no absorbance IR acid form, CHC13 3018, 2976, 2940, 1731, 1457, 1379, 1206, 1118, 1088, 1041, 1021, 978, and 968 cm f see Fig. 1 IR Na salt, CHC13 3018, 2979, 2938, 2881, 2832, 1710, 1591, 1454, 1387, 1306, 1243, 1215, 1170, 1117, 1089, 1076, 974, 967 and 874 cm l see Fig. 2 Solubility Not very soluble in water soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide, lower alcohols such as methanol, ketones such as acetone, esters such as ethyl acetate, halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform and hydrocarbons such as diethyl ether, benezene, toluene and warm hexane. Based on its physical characteristics A80438 is believed to have the structure shown in formula 1.As is apparent from its structure, A80438 has an acid function capable of forming salts and ester derivatives.A80438 also has at least one hydroxyl group which can be esterified or which can form ether derivatives. The acyl and alkyl ester, the alkyl ether and the urethane derivatives of A80438, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of A80438 and of these derivatives are also useful as antibiotics and as agents which increase feedutilization efficiency. The term acyl means a C1 to C7, preferably aC1 to C4, alkanoic acid moiety, i.e., a radical of the formulaEMI5.1 wherein Rla is C1 to C6 alkyl or hydrogen, e.g., acetyl, propionyl, butyryl and the like. The term cycloalkyl means cyclic hydrocarbon groups containing from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, such as, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclohexyl and the like, cyclohexyl being preferred. The cycloalkyl group may be substituted by an aryl residue, as defined herein, to form an arylcycloalkyl residue, e.g., 2 phenyl cyclopropyl. The term alkoxy means a C1 to C7 lower alkyl group having an oxygen function substituted therein, such as, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy and the like. The term aryl denotes an aromatic residue derived by the removal of a hydrogen atom from an aromatic hydrocarbon, such as, for example, phenyl, pyridyl or furyl, especially phenyl. The aryl residue may be substituted by various groups. A substitutent on a phenyl nucleus is preferably on the 4 position.Examples are 4 alkylaryl, e.g., 4 methylphenyl 4tolyl 4 halophenyl, e.g., 4 chlorophenyl 4 nitrophenyl 4 aryloxy aryl, e.g., 4 phenoxyphenyl 4 alkoxyphenyl, e.g., 4 methoxyphenyl and 4 alkyl carbonyl phenyl, e.g., 4 methylcarbonyl phenyl or 4 phenylcarbonyl phenyl. tert alkyl means a C1 to C7 straight or branched chain hydrocarbon, preferably a C1 to C4 hydrocarbon, e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, etc. The alkyl group may be substituted by an aryl residue, as defined supra, to form an arylalkyl residue, e.g., phenylethyl or 2 phenylethyl or by a ha oaryl residue to form a haloarylalkyl residue, e.g., 4 bromophenethyl. The term an A80438 compound is used herein to designate antibiotic A80438 formula 1 , an acyl or alkyl ester or an alkyl ether derivative of antibioticA80438, a urethane derivative of antibiotic A80438 formula 2 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of antibiotic A80438 or of its acyl or alkyl ester, alkyl ether or urethane derivatives. Antibiotic A80438 can be produced by the submerged aerobic cultivation of an A80438 producina strain of Streptomyces bobili NRRL 15971 or Streptomyces ctum culture, NRRL 15970. The antibiotic can be recovered from the culture medium by using various isolation and purification procedures understood in the art. Cultures of the two A80438 producing organisms have been deposited and made part of the stock culture collection of the Midwest Area Northern RegionalResearch Center, Agricultural Research Service, U.S.Department of Agriculture, 1815 North University Street,Peoria, Illinois 61604, from which they are available to the public under the accession numbers NRRL 15971 the S. bobili strain and NRRL 15970 the S. pactum strain . The new Streptomyces bobili strain which is useful for the preparation of antibiotic A80438 was isolated from a soil sample from Scotland. For convenience in describing the S. bobili strain, it is called the A80438 culture. Taxonomic studies of this organism were carried out by Frederick P. Mertz of the Lilly ResearchLaboratories. Based on these studies, the organism is classified as a new strain of Streptomyces bobili Waksman and Curtis 1916 Waksman and Henrici 1948.This classification is based on an examination of published descriptions of this species R. E. Buchanan, and N. E. Gibbons eds , Bergey s Manual of DeterminativeBacteriology , 8th Edition, The Williams and WilkinsCo., Baltimore, 1974 E. G. Shirling, and D. Gottlieb, Cooperative Description of Type Cultures of Streptomyces ,Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 18 4 279 399 1968 and S. A.Waksman, The Actinomycetes Vol. II , The Williams andWilkins Co., Baltimore, 1961 . Methods Used The methods recommended by the InternationalStreptomyces Project ISP for the characterization ofStreptomyces species E. B. Shirling and D. Gottlieb, Methods for Characterization of Streptomyces Species ,Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 16 3 , 313 340 1966 have been followed along with certain supplementary tests D.Berd, Laboratory Identification of Clinically ImportantAerobic Actinomycetes , Appl. Microbiol. 25 4 , 665 681 1973 and D. J. Blazevic and G. M. Ederer, Principles of Biochemical Tests in Diagnostic Microbiology , JohnWiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1975, p. 136 . Carbon utilization was determined on ISP No. 9 basal medium to which filter sterilized carbon sources were added to equal a final concentration of 1.0 percent. Plates were incubated at 300C. and read after 14 days. Melanoid pigment production chromogenicity was determined with ISP No. 1 tryptone yeast extract broth , ISP No. 6 peptone yeast extract iron agar , ISPNo. 7 tyrosine agar and modified ISP No. 7 which has tyrosine removed. Starch hydrolysis was determined by testing for the presence of starch with iodine on ISP No. 4 inorganic salts starch agar plates see Blazevic andEderer, supra . Morphology was studied using an optical light microscope. A scanning electron microscope SEM was used to study the spore surface ornamentation. NaCl tolerance was measured by adding NaC1 toISP No. 2 agar to equal the concentration desired. ICSS NBS Centroid Color Charts, standard sample No. 2106 National Bureau of Standards, 1958, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. and theColor Harmony Manual 4th ed., Color Standards Department, Container Corporation of America, Chicago, Illinois, 1958 were used to assign color names. The isomers of diaminopimelic acid DAP and the carbohydrates in hydrolysates of whole cells were established by the chromatographic methods of Becker et al. B. Becker, M. P. Lechevalier, R. E. Gordon, and H. A. Lechevalier, Rapid Differentiation between Nocardia and Streptomyces by Paper Chromatography of Whole cellHydrolysates , Appl. Microbiol. 12, 421 423 1964 and of Lechevalier M. P. Lechevalier, Identification ofAerobic Actinomycetes of Clinical Importance ,J. Lab. Clin. Med. 71, 934 944 1968 . Resistance to lysozyme was measured by methods recommended by Gordon and Barnett R. E. Gordon and D.A. Barnett, Resistance to Rifampin and Lysozyme ofStrains of Some Species of Mycobacterium and Nocardia as a Taxonomic Tool , Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 27, 176 178 1977 . Resistance to antibiotics was measured by padding antibiotic sensitivity discs onto the surface of seeded ISP No. 2 agar plates. Phosphatase and urease were determined by methods described by Blazevic and Ederer, supra.Cultural Characteristics The organism has very limited growth on both complex and chemically defined media. From a total of 15 agar culture media, only 5 support good growth, 4 support minimal growth, and the remaining 6 do not support any growth. ISP media Nos. 2, 5 and 7, Emerson s agar, and yeast dextrose agar support good growth.Aerial mycelia are not produced. Coremia are formed abundantly. The limited growth ability and the abundant formation of coremia are distinctive features of this culture. The coremia, which macroscopically resemble poorly developed secondary growth, have a reddish color. The nearest matching color tab in the Tresner and BackusSystem tH. D. Tresner and E. J. Backus, System of ColorWheels for Streptomycete Taxonomy, Appl. Microbiol.11 335 338 1956 is 5 cb grayish yellowish pink. The reverse side of the colony is reddish orange to a light yellowish brown. No soluble pigments are produced. These cultural features are best demonstrated on ISP medium No. 7 tyrosine agar . Table I presents these cultural characteristics.

Morphological Characteristics A80438 does not produce sporophores. The presence of coremia represents a special morphological characteristic. The coremia are fibrous, abundant, and readily observed with both light and electron microscopes. Physiological Characteristics Analysis of hydrolyzed whole cells indicates that LL DAP is present, but the meso isomer is not present. Arabinose, glucose, rhamnose, and ribose are the sugar components. The cell wall is type I.Arabinose is normally not present in Streptomyces cell walls. However, Pridham T. G. Pridham and A. J. Lyons,Jr, Progress in Clarification of the Taxonomic andNomenclatural Status of Some Problem Actinomycetes , inDevelopments In Industrial Microbiology, Vol. 10 ,American Institute of Biological Sciences, Washington,D.C., 1969 lists several species where arabinose was found. The cell wall sugar pattern is classified NC no characteristic sugar . Culture A80438 belongs to the genus Streptomyces however, it is not a typical taxon of this genus. The carbon utilization pattern for A80438 is as follows adonitol, cellobiose, D fructose,D galactose, D glucose, i inositol, D lactose,D melezitose, D melibiose, raffinose, L rhamnose, ribose, sucrose, trehalose and D xylose are utilized for growth. L Arabinose, cellulose, dextran, inulin, mannitol, D mannose, salicin and xylitol do not support growth Culture A80438 is resistant to cephalothin 30 pg , lincomycin 2 pg and penicillin G 10 units .It is sensitive to bacitracin 10 units 1 gentamicin 10 pg , neomycin 30 pg , oleandomycin 15 units , rifampin 5 pug , streptomycin 10 pg , tetracycline 30 pg , tobramycin 10 pg , vancomycin 30 pg and lysozyme. Culture A80438 is Gram positive, and nonacid fast. It does not hydrolyse or peptonize skim milk, and does not liquefy gelatin. It reduces nitrate to nitrites in organic nitrate broth ISP 8 , tolerates up to 4 percent NaCl, and grows at temperatures between 10 and 42 C. It does not survive when exposed to 500C. for 8 hours. Melanoid pigments are not produced when A80438 is grown in ISP 1 tryptone yeast extract broth or on slants of ISP 6 peptone yeast extract iron agar orISP 7 tyrosine agar . A80438 produces catalase, phosphatase and urease. Culture A80438 decomposes casein, DNA, esculin, hypoxanthine, tyrosine and xanthine. It does not decompose calcium malate, chitin, elastin, guanine, hippurate, keratin or starch. Species Determination Cultural, morphological, and physiological characteristics of strain A80438 were compared with the published descriptions of similar species. The following five species resemble A80438 Streptomyces aerocolonigenes a Streptomyces bobilia Streptomyces qlomeroaurantiacusb Streptomyces vendarqenesisC Streptomyces verne c aShirling and Gottlieb, 1968, supra.bE.

Gottlieb, Cooperative Desription of Type Cultures of Streptomyces , Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 19 4 , 375 390 1969 . These five cultures are reported in the literature as being devoid of aerial mycelia, not producing melanoid pigments, having a similar carbon utilization pattern, and having other cultural and physiological properties in common with A80438. Of the five cultures, S. bobili has more characteristics in agreement with A80438. In addition, only S. bobili and S. glomeroaurantiacus are listed as validly published in the Approved Lists of BacterialNames V.B.D. Skerman et al., Approved Lists of Bacterial Names , Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 30 1 , 225 420 1980 . S. bobili is similar to A80438 culturally and physiologically. Culturally, neither produces aerial mycelia or soluble pigments. Both have a rather distinctive reddish orange pigment on the reverse side of the colony. Since neither culture produces aerial mycelia, morphological comparisons cannot be made.A80438 produces coremia. The published descriptions ofS. bobili do not mention these structures. Because Waksman, supra, states that coremia formation is of no taxonomic significance , this distinguishing feature ofA80438 was not greatly emphasized. Physiological characteristics shared by A80438 and S. bobili are reduction of nitrate, absence of melanoid pigmentation, toleration of 4 percent NaCl, inhibition by streptomycin, and a similar carbonutilization pattern. The similarities and differences between A80438 and S. bobili are summarized below Similarities Differences Absence of aerial mycelium Gelatin liquefaction Absence of melanoid pigments Growth on Czapek s agar Absence of soluble pigments Growth on glucose asparagine agar Carbon utilization pattern Hydrolysis of starch Color of reverse side Peptonization of milk Inhibition by streptomycin Reverse color pH indicator NaCl tolerance Nitrate reduction Table II gives a detailed comparison of the characteristics of A80438 and S. bobili.Table Il Comparison of the Characteristics of A80438 and Streptomyces bobili Characteristic A80438 S. bobiliAerial myceliumGelatin liquefaction Growth on Czapek s agar trace abundantGrowth on glucose asparagine agar Melanoid pigmentation NaCl tolerance percent 4 4Nitrate reduction Peptonization of skim milk Reverse color a pH indicator Reverse side color reddish orange reddish orangeSoluble pigmentStarch hydrolysis Streptomycin inhibition Utilization of L arabinose D fructose D galactose D glucose i inositol D lactose mannitol raffinose L rhamnose salicin sucrose D xylose Positive reaction negative reaction These comparisons demonstrate that A80438 is similar toS. bobili.The differences are not considered sufficient to erect A80438 as a new taxon. Therefore, culture A80438 is classified as a strain of Streptomyces bobili Waksman and Curtis 1916 Waskman and Henrici 1948. As is the case with other organisms, the characteristics of the A80438 producing cultureStreptomyces bobili NRRL 15971 are subject to variation.Recombinants, mutants or variants of the strain may be obtained by methods known in the art. For example, mutants can be obtained by treatment with various known physical and chemical mutagens such as ultraviolet light, X rays, gamma rays and chemicals such as Nmethyl N nitro N nitrosoguanidine. All natural and induced variants, mutants and recombinants of thisStreptomyces bobili strain which retain the characteristic of A80438 production are part of this invention. The microorganism of this invention, which has been designated Streptomyces pactum, is useful for the preparation of antibiotic A80438. This microorganism was isolated from a soil sample from New Jersey. A culture of the Streptomyces pactum strain of this invention has been deposited and made part of the stock culture collection of the Midwest Area Northern RegionalResearch Center, Agricultural Research Service, U.S.Department of Agriculture, 1815 North University Street,Peoria, Illinois 61604, from which it is available to the public under the accession number NRRL 15970. Taxonomic studies of this organism were carried out by Frederick P. Mertz of the Lilly ResearchLaboratories. Based on these studies, the organism is classified as a new strain of Streptomyces pactumBhuyan, Dietz and Smith 1962. This classification is based on an examination of published descriptions of this species R. E. Buchanan, and N. E. Gibbons eds , Bergey s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology , 8thEdition, The Williams and Wilkins Co., Baltimore, 1974 and E. B. Shirling, and D. Gottlieb, CooperativeDescription of Type Cultures of Streptomyces ,Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 22 4 265 394 1972 . For convenience, the new Streptomyces pactum strain is called the A80373 culture in the following discussion of its characteristics. Methods Used The methods recommended by the InternationalStreptomyces Project ISP for the characterization ofStreptomyces species E. B. Shining and D. Gottlieb, Methods for Characterization of Streptomyces Species ,Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 16 3 , 313 340 1966 have been followed. Carbon utilization was determined on ISP No. 9 basal medium to which filter sterilized carbon sources were added to equal a final concentration of 1.0 percent. Plates were incubated at 300C. and read after 14 days. Melanoid pigment production chromogenicity was determined with ISP No. 1 tryptone yeast extract broth , ISP No. 6 peptone yeast extract iron agar andISP No. 7 tyrosine agar . Starch hydrolysis was determined by testing for the presence of starch with iodine on ISP No. 4 inorganic salts starch agar plates D. J. Blazevic and G. M. Ederer, Principles of Biochemical Tests inDiagnostic Microbiology , John Wiley and Sons, Inc.,New York, 1975, p. 136 . Morphology was studied using an optical light microscope. A scanning electron microscope SEM was used to study the spore surface ornamentation. NaC1 tolerance was measured by adding NaC1 toISP No. 2 agar to equal the concentration desired. ICSS NBS Centroid Color Charts, standard sample No. 2106 National Bureau of Standards, U.S.Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C., 1958 and theColor Harmony Manual 4th ed., Color Standards Department, Container Corporation of America, Chicago, Illinois, 1958 were used to assign color names. The isomer of diaminopimelic acid DAP and the carbohydrates in hydrolysates of whole cells were established by the chromatographic methods of Becker et al. B. Becker, M. P. Lechevalier, R. E. Gordon, and H.A. Lechevalier, Rapid Differentiation between Nocardia and Streptomyces by Paper Chromatography of Whole cellHydrolysates , Appl. Microbiol. 12, 421 423 1964 and of Lechevalier M. P. Lechevalier, Identification ofAerobic Actinomycetes of Clinical Importance , J. Lab.Clin. Med. 71, 934 944 1968 . Resistance to antibiotics was measured by padding antibiotic sensitivity discs onto the surface of seeded ISP No. 2 agar plates. Cultural Characteristics A total of 15 agar media were used to study the cultural characteristics of this strain. Although abundant growth was observed on a number of the media, good aerial production was limited to only a few media.The culture formed aerial hyphae in the gray color series on yeast malt extract agar ISP No. 2 , glycerol asparagine agar ISP No. 5 , glucose asparagine agar, tomato pasteoatmeal agar and tyrosine agar ISP No. 7 . The nearest matching color tab is d light Gray in the Tresner andBackus system 1H D. Tresner and E. J. Backus, System ofColor Wheels for Streptomycete Taxonomy, Appl. Microbiol.11 335 338 1956 . Very poor growth and aerial production were observed on oatmeal agar ISP No. 3 , Czapek s agar, Anio Hensens agar and potato carrot agar. Sporemass color on these media was white. Growth was not observed on starch salts ISP No. 4 or tap water agar.Coremia and sterile aerial hyphae were produced on a number of agar media. A80373 is placed in the gray color series. The reverse side of A80373 is yellow brown to dark reddish brown, depending on the medium. A light brown soluble pigment is present when the culture is grown in ISP Nos. 2, 5 and 7 media.

The culture produces coremia on Emerson, glucose asparagine and yeast dextrose agars. Coiled sporophores of 3 5 turns are seen on a number of media. This is best illustrated on Czapek s solution agar. Culture A80373 is placed in the Spirales S section of Pridham T. G. Pridham and A. J. Lyons, Jr. Progress in Clarification of the Taxonomic and Nomenclatural Status of Some Problem Actinomycetes , In Developments In Industrial Microbiology , Vol. 10,American Institute of Biological Sciences, Washington,D.C., 1969 . Spores are arranged in chains of 10 to 50. When examined by scanning electron microscopy, the spore surface ornamentation is either spiny sp or hairy ha with very short non characteristics hairs. Physiological Characteristics Analysis of hydrolyzed whole cells indicates that LL DAP is present, but the meso isomer is not present. Thus, A80373 has a type I cell wall Lechevalier, supra . Sugar components of whole cells are glucose, arabinose and rhamnose. Although arabinose is normally absent from cell walls of Streptomyces,Pridham, supra, lists species where it is present. The sugar pattern is classified as NC not characteristic .Culture A80373 is classified as belonging to the genusStreptomyces. The carbon utilization pattern for A80373 is as follows A80373 uses adonitol, fructose, glucose and ribose. A80373 does not use L arabinose, cellobiose, cellulose, dextran, galactose, inositol, inulin, lactose, mannitol, mannose, melezitose, melibiose, raffinose, L rhamnose, salicin, sucrose, trehalose, xylitol or xylose. Culture A80373 is resistant to cephalothin 30 pg , lincomycin 2 pg , penicillin G 10 units and streptomycin 10 pg . It is sensitive to bacitracin 10 units , gentamicin 10 pg , neomycin 30 pg , oleandomycin 15 pg , rifampin 5 pg , tetracycline 30 pg , tobramycin 10 pg and vancomycin 30 pg . Culture A80373 does not reduce nitrate to nitrite in organic nitrate broth ISP No. 8 or hydrolyze skim milk or starch. It does produce catalase, liquefy gelatin, hydrolyze calcium malate, and survive at 500C for 8 hours. A80373 will tolerate only 1 NaCl, and will grow at temperatures between 5 and 300C. Melanoid pigments are not produced when A80373 is grown in tryptone yeast extract broth ISP No. 1 or on slants of peptone yeast extract iron agar ISP No. 6 and ISP No. 7. A comparison of A80373 and another A80438 producing strain, Streptomyces bobili NRRL 15971, indicates that, although they share many common characteristics, and both produce the same antibiotic, they are separate species.

Temperature range Species Determination Using several keys to the species of Streptomyces, the cultural, morphological and physiological characteristics of A80373 were used to select a group of strains with similar characteristics. The published descriptions were then examined, and compared with A80373.The following six species were selected as having close resemblance to A80373 Streptomyces albulus a Streptomyces chattanoogensis b Streptomyces craterlter Streptomyces qalteri c Streptomyces karnatkensis Streptomyces pactum aE.B.

Bacteriol. 19 4 375 512 1969 A close inspection of the published data shows thatA80373 has the most characteristics in agreement withS. karnatakensis. In addition, A80373 keyed directly to this species in several instances. S. karnatakensis and S. pactum are clustered closely together in two independent numerical phenetic studies tW. Kurylowicz, A. Paszkiewicz, W. Woznicka, andW. Kurzatkowski, Numerical Taxonomy of Streptomycetes, Polish Medical Publishers, Warsaw, 1975 and S.T. Williams,M. Goodfellow, G. Alderson, E.M.H. Wellington, P.H.A.Sneath and M.J. Sackin, Numerical Classification ofStreptomyces and Related Genera, J. Gen. Microbiol. 129, 1743 1813 1983 . Williams states that they are joined together at a 96 similarity level. He drops the nameS. karnatakensis and uses S. pactum as the cluster name. Of the two names, only S. pactum is in the Approved Lists V.B.D. Skerman, et al, Approved Lists ofBacterial Names, Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 30 1 225 420 1980 1 consequently, it is the only one validly published. The name S. pactum, therefore, will be used. Culture A80373 and S. pactum both belong to the gray color series, exhibit similar reverse side color, have some soluble pigments, grow poorly onCzapek s agar, have almost identical carbon utilization patterns, possess spiral morphology and hairy spores.Neither produces melanoid pigments. They differ in their growth on glycerol asparagine and oatmeal agars, ability to produce coremia, hydrolysis of calcium malate and NaCl tolerance.

Although the spore surface ofA80373 is not unmistakably hairy as is S. pactum, the differences are not considered sufficient to assignA80373 to a different species. Therefore, cultureA80373 is classified as a strain of Streptomyces pactumBhuyan, Dietz and Smith 1962. As is the case with other organisms, the characteristics of the A80438 producing culture of this invention, Streptomyces pactum NRRL 15970, are subject to variation. Recombinants, mutants or variants of the strain may be obtained by methods in the art. For example, mutants can be obtained by treatment with various known physical and chemical mutagens such as ultraviolet light, X rays, gamma rays and chemicals such as N methylN nitro N nitrosoguanidine. Natural and induced variants, mutants and recombinants of Streptomyces vacuum NRRL 15970 which retain the characteristic ofA80438 production are part of this invention. The culture medium used to grow Streptomyces bobili NRRL 15971 or Streptomyces pactum NRRL 15970 can be any one of a number of media. For economy in production, optimal yield, and ease of product isolation, however, certain culture media are preferred. For example, for S. bobili a preferred carbohydrate source in large scale fermentation is glucose, although ribose, xylose, fructose, galactose, potato dextrin and the like can also be used. Glucose is also a preferred carbohydrate source for S. pactum, although sucrose, fructose, blackstrap molasses, starch and the like can also be used. A preferred nitrogen source for both S. bobili and S. pactum is enzyme hydrolyzed casein. Another preferred nitrogen source for S. pactum is meat peptone.Other nitrogen sources such as fish meal, liver meal, and the like should also be useful nitrogen sources. Among the nutrient inorganic salts which may advantageously be incorporated in the culture media are the customary soluble salts capable of yielding zinc, sodium, magnesium, calcium, ammonium, chloride, carbonate, sulfate, nitrate and like ions. Essential trace elements necessary for the growth and development of the organism should also be included in the culture medium. Such trace elements commonly occur as impurities in other substituents of the medium in amounts sufficient to meet the growth requirements of the organism. Foaming is not usually a problem, but small amounts i.e. 0.2 ml L of an antifoam agent such as polypropylene glycol may be added to large scale fermentation media if needed. For production of substantial quantities of antibiotic A80438, submerged aerobic fermentation in tanks is preferred. Small quantities of A80438 may be oLtained by shake flask culture. Because of the time lag in antibiotic production commonly associated with inoculation of large tanks with the spore form of the organism, it is preferable to use a vegetative inoculum.The vegetative inoculum is prepared by inoculating a small volume of culture medium with the spore form or mycelial fragments of the organism to obtain a fresh, actively growing culture of the organism. The vegetative inoculum is then transferred to a larger tank. The vegetative inoculum medium can be the same as that used for larger fermentations, but other media are also suitable. A80438 is produced by StreDtomyces bobili or Streptomyces pactum when grown at temperatures between about 250 and about 370C. A good temperature for A80438 production appears to be about 30 C. As is customary in submerged aerobic culture processes, sterile air is blown into the vessel from the bottom while the medium is stirred with conventional turbine impellors. Under the conditions used thus far, the maximum oxygen uptake of the fermentation does not exceed about 0.2 mM L minute. In a fully baffled 165 liter fermentor containing approximately 115 liters of broth, an aeration rate of 0.125 v v m with an agitation rate of 150 200 rpm is sufficient to maintain the level of dissolved oxygen at or above 30 of air saturation. Production of antibiotic A80438 can be followed during the fermentation by testing samples of the broth for antibiotic activity against organisms known to be sensitive to the antibiotic. One assay organism useful in testing A80438 is Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633.The bioassay is conveniently performed by the agar well plate test. Following its production under submerged aerobic fermentation conditions, A80438 can be recovered from the fermentation medium by methods used in the fermentation art. The antibiotic activity produced during fermentation of the A80438 producing organism occurs both in the filtered broth and in the mycelial mass. Maximum recovery of A80438 is accomplished, therefore, by initially filtering the medium to separate the broth from the mycelial mass. The filtered broth and the mycelial mass can then be purified separately to give their respective portion of A80438. A variety of techniques may be used in this purification. A preferred technique for purification of the filtered broth involves adjusting it to a pH of about 9 and extracting with a suitable solvent such as, for example, ethyl acetate. The extracting solvent can then be evaporated under vacuum to give the broth portion ofA80438. A preferred method of purifying the mycelial mass is to extract the separated mycelial filter cake with a suitable solvent such as, for example, methanol.The extracting solvent is then evaporated under vacuum to give a concentrated aqueous solution. This aqueous solution is then adjusted to a pH of about 9 and is extracted with a suitable solvent such as, for example, ethyl acetate. The extracting solvent is then concentrated under vacuum to give the mycelial portion ofA80438. The broth and mycelial portions of the A80438 complex are further purified by similar procedures. A preferred procedure involves silica gel chromatography. Separation of antibiotic A80438 can be followed by thin layer chromatography TLC or high performance liquid chromatography HPLC . One convenient silica gel TLC solvent system is toluene ethanol 4 1 .The antibiotic can be detected by bioautography using, for example, Bacillus subtilis or by other methods such as, for example, vanillin sulfuric acid spray reagent. Alternatively, the culture solids, including medium constituents and mycelium can be used without extraction or separation, but preferably after removal of water, as a source of A80438. For example, after production of A80438, the whole fermentation broth can be dried by lyophilization, by drum drying, or by azeotropic distillation and drying. The dried broth is then mixed directly into feed premix. The salts of A80438 and of its derivatives are useful for separating and purifying the antibiotics.The pharmaceutically acceptable salts are particularly useful. Examples of salts are the alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and amine salts of A80438 and of its derivatives. Representative and suitable alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts of A80438 include the sodium, potassium, lithium, cesium, rubidium, barium, calcium and magnesium salts. Suitable amine salts of A80438 include the ammonium and the primary, secondary, and tertiary Cl C4 alkylammonium and hydroxy C2 C4 alkylammonium salts. Illustrative amine salts include those formed by reaction of A80438 with ammonium hydroxide, methylamine, sec butylamine, isopropylamine, diethylamine, di isopropylamine, ethanolamine, triethylamine, 3 amino l propanol and the like. It is well known in the veterinary pharmaceutical art that the form of an antibiotic is not ordinarily of great significance when treating an animal with the antibiotic. In most cases, conditions within the animal change the drug to a form other than that in which it was administered. The salt form in which it may be administered is, therefore, not of great significance. The salt form may, however, be chosen for reasons of economy, convenience, and toxicity. The alkali metal and alkaline earth metal cationic salts of A80438 are prepared according to procedures commonly used for the preparation of cationic salts. For example, the free acid form of A80438 is dissolved in a suitable solvent such as acetone about volume of water is added and this solution is adjusted to a pH of about 9 to 10 with the base of the desired cationic salt e.g. NaOH, KOH . The salt thus formed can be isolated by routine methods, such as filtration or evaporation of the solvent. A preferred method of forming salts is to dissolve A80438 acid form in a water immiscible solvent such as ethyl acetate, add an equal volume of water adjust the mixture to pH 10 with the corresponding cationic base e.g. NaOH, KOH, etc. . The separated organic phase is washed with water and concentrated to dryness. The residue is lyophilized from dioxane. The salt can be crystallized from an appropriate solvent, such as pentane. The salts formed with organic amines can be prepared in a similar manner. For example, the gaseous or liquid amine can be added to a solution of A80438 in a suitable solvent such as acetone the solvent and excess amine can be removed by evaporation. A80438 acyl ester derivatives are prepared by treating A80438 with a corresponding acid anhydride or acid halide, for example, chloride. Esterification occurs at one of the A80438 hydroxyl groups. Such esters are typically prepared by reacting A80438 with, for example, the corresponding acid anhydride at room temperature. A80438 alkyl ester derivatives are prepared by esterification of the carboxyl group, using standard procedures. The A80438 alkyl ester derivatives are typically less active in vitro. When administered to an animal, however, such esters can act as pro drugs which are converted to A80438 in vivo. The alkyl ether derivatives of A80438 are those compounds wherein one or more of the hydroxyl groups has been replaced by a YR group wherein Y represents 0 or S and R represents Cl C6 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy C2 c5 aikyl, C1 C4 alkoxycarbonyl C2 C5 alkyl, amino C2 C5 alkyl, mercapto C2 C5 alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, haloalkyl, or R m phenyl CH2 n , wherein R represents C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, or hydroxy m represents 0 2 and n represents 0 3.The terms alkyl and alkoxy have the meaning discussed supra, but are limited to the number of carbon atoms specified. The term hydroxyalkyl refers either to a monohydroxy C2 C5 alkyl moiety or, when Y is 0, to the 2,3 dihydroxyprop 1 yl moiety. The term haloalkyl refers to a C2 C5 alkyl moiety having from one to three halogen substituents, selected from the group consisting of bromine, chlorine, and fluorine. When the alkyl moiety is dihalo or trihalo substituted, the halo substituents must be the same halogen moiety. Preferred A80438 ether derivatives are those compounds wherein Y represents 0 and R represents C1 C6 alkyl. The ether derivatives are prepared by reactingA80438, or a salt thereof, with a corresponding primary alcohol or thiol. With some of the starting alcohols or thiols it may be necessary to add an acid catalyst to the reaction. Suitable catalysts include hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, perchloric acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, selenium dioxide, and boron trifluoride. A solvent such as, for example, water, acetone, benzene, ether, tetrahydrofuran, or dioxane may be added to facilitate the reaction. Reactions generally occur at room temperature, although higher temperatures may be used. Although ordinary reaction work up procedures are sometimes sufficient, additional purification may be required to obtain the compounds of this invention.Such purification may be accomplished by well known methods, such as, for example, column chromatography, thin layer chromatography, fractional crystallization and the like. The A80438 urethane derivatives of formula 2 can be prepared by treating A80438 or an A80438 salt with an isocyanate of formula 3 R NCO 3 wherein R is as defined supra. Preferably, a salt of A80438, in particular the sodium salt, is used. The isocyanate of formula 3 should be added in slight excess, e.g., about 10 excess, in order to form the mono derivative in optimum quantity. The reaction is preferably carried out in an inert solvent such as a chlorinated hydrocarbon, e.g., carbon tetrachloride, methylene chloride or chloroform, ether, ethyl acetate or in an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent such as benzene or toluene. The reaction temperature is not critical but can be between above OOC. and the boiling point of the reaction mixture, but is preferably about room temperature. The A80438 compounds inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi which are pathogenic to animal and plant life. For example, Table III shows the inhibitory concentration MIC at which A80438 inhibits certain organisms. The MIC s in Table III were determined by conventional agar dilution assays.

Anticoccidial activity is an important property of the A80438 compounds.

In this study, groups of five 7 day old chicks were fed a mash diet containing the antibiotic. After having been on this ration for 48 hours, each bird was inoculated with sporulated oocysts of E. tenella. Two other groups of five 7 day old chicks were fed a mash diet which did not containA80438. One of these groups was also inoculated withE. tenella after 48 hours the infected controls . The other group was not inoculated with E. tenella the normal controls .

The A80438 compound can be supplied in many ways, but it is most conveniently supplied with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, preferably the feed ingested by the birds.Although a variety of factors must be considered in determining an appropriate concentration of A80438 compound, the rates of administration are generally in the range of about 2 to about 100 ppm in the feed and are preferably in the range of about 25 to about 75 ppm of feed ration. In another aspect, this invention relates to compositions for treating coccidiosis in poultry containing an A80438 compound. One group of these are compositions comprising an effective amount of an A80438 compound for treating coccidiosis together with a suitable vehicle. Another group of these are compositions comprising an effective amount of 1 an A80438 compound in combination with 2 a compound selected from the group consisting of a nicarbazin, t b 4,4 dinitrocarbanilide, c a napthalenamine compound of formula 4 EMI44.1 wherein R2 is C1 C4 alkyl R is halogen, C1 C4 fluoroalkyl, C1 C4 fluoroalkoxy or C1 C4 fluoroalkylthio R4 is halogen R5 is hydrogen or halogen m is 0, 1 or 2 and n is O or 1 4 exists, it is at other than the 2 position d a benzenamine selected from 2,4 dinitroN 4 trifluoromethoxy phenyl 6 trifluoromethyl benzenamine 2,4 dinitro N 4 1,1,2,2 tetrafluoroethoxy phenyl 6 trifluoromethyl benzenamine or 2 ,4 dinitro N 4 pentafluoroethoxy phenyll 6 trifluoromethyl benzenamine e metichlorpindol or f a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of an a e compound. In formula 4, C1 C4 alkyl includes methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, sec butyl, isobutyl, tert butyl, and the like. The term halogen represents fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. C1 C4 Fluoroalkyl is a C1 C4 alkyl group bearing one or more fluorine atoms. Such fluoroalkyl groups include trifluoromethyl, 1,1,2,2 tetrafluoroethyl, pentafluoroethyl, 1,2,3,3 tetrafluoropropyl, nonafluorobutyl, and the like. C1 C4 Fluoroalkoxy is a C1 C4 alkoxy group bearing one or more fluorine atoms. Such fluoroalkoxy groups include difluoromethoxy, trifluoromethoxy, 1 fluoroethoxy, 1,1,2,2 tetrafluoroethoxy, pentafluoroethoxy, 1,2,2,3,3 pentafluoropropoxy, heptafluoropropoxy, 4,4,4 trifluorobutoxy, and the like. C1 C4 Fluoroalkylthio is a C1 C4 alkylthio group bearing one or more fluorine atoms. Such fluoroalkylthio groups include trifluoromethylthio, 1,1,2,2 tetrafluoroethylthio, pentafluoroethylthio, 4,4,4 trifluorobutylthio, and the like. Preferred formula 4 compounds are those wherein m and n are 0 and R5is hydrogen.

Anticoccidial combinations comprising nicarbazin or 4,4 dinitrocarbanilide and polyether antibiotics are disclosed by Maurice E. Callender and Thomas K. Jeffers in U.S. Patent 4,218,438, issued August 19, 1980.Anticoccidial combinations of the napthalenamines of formula 4 with polyether antibiotics are disclosed by Albert J. Clinton and George 0. P. O Doherty in copending application Serial No. 631,665, filed July 17, 1984.Anticoccidial combinations comprising the specified benzenamines and a polyether antibiotic are disclosed byClinton and O Doherty in U.S. Patent 4,366,168. A coccidiocidal combination of monensin a polyether antibiotic and metichlorpindol is disclosed by Larry R.McDougald in U.S. Patent 4,061,755, issued December 6, 1977. Nicarbazin and 4,4 dinitrocarbanilide are taught in U.S. Patent 2,731,382. Nicarbazin is a complex of 4,4 dinitrocarbanilide and 2 hydroxy 4,6dimethylpyrimidine, but the 4,4 dinitrocarbanilide alone exhibits anticoccidial activity. See Science 122, 244 1955 . The components of the combinations of anA80438 compound with compounds 2 a e are used in amounts which, in combination, are synergistic as to at least one coccidiosis causing organism. In general, the maximum amounts to be used in the combinations are the same as the maximum amounts for anticoccidial treatment by the individual components. The lower limits are generally less than that required for therapy by the individual components. Accordingly, the present invention is generally practiced with compositions containing 1 from about 2 to about 100 ppm of an A80438 compound and 2 a from about 5 to 125 ppm of nicarbazin, b from about 25 to about 150 ppm of 4,4 dinitrocarbanilide, c from about 1 to about 1000 ppm of the specified napthalenamine, d from about 5 to about 125 ppm of a specified benzenamine, or e from about 20 to about 70 ppm of metichlorpindol.The A 80438 compounds should be particularly effective when administered with nicarbazin.Preferred combinations contain from about 2 to about 20 ppm of an A80438 compound with from about 5 to about 50 ppm of nicarbazin. Another important property of the A80438 compounds is the ability to improve feed utilization efficiency in animals. For example, the A80438 compounds improve feed utilization efficiency in ruminants which have a developed rumen function. The efficiency of feed use can be monitored by observing the production and concentration of propionate compounds in the rumen using the method described byArthur P. Raun in U.S. Patent 3,794,732 see especiallyExample 5 . Table VII shows the ratio of volatile fattyacid VFA concentrations in A80438 treated flasks to concentrations in control flasks in this test.

Preferable rates of administration are from about 0.05 mg kg day to about 0.5 mg kg day. A preferred method of administration is to mix the compound with the animals feed. This invention further relates to feed compositions adapted to increase feed utilization in ruminant animals comprising feed ration and from 2.5 to 25 grams per ton of an A80438 compound. As described supra, A80438 compounds are active against anaerobic bacteria, including Clostridium Perfringens. A80438 compounds should, therefore, be beneficial in the treatment of which includes prevention of enteritis in chickens, swine, cattle and sheep.A80438 compounds should also be useful in the treatment of enterotoxemia in ruminants. In another aspect the A80438 compounds are useful in the treatment of swine dysentery. A80438 inhibits the growth of Treponema hyodysenteriae, the causative agent of swine dysentery, at levels less than or equal to 0.39 mcg ml. A preferred method of administering an A80438 compound to swine comprises incorporating an effective amount of the compound into the feed ration or drinking water. An appropriate effective amount will depend upon whether the treatment is to prevent dysentery in swine exposed to the disease or to cure swine already infected with the disease. Usually, a lower concentration of active compound is needed to prevent infection than is required to eliminate infection in animals already afflicted. In general, amounts in the range of from about 20 to about 100 grams of A80438 compound per ton of feed are effective to prevent infection. Amounts in the range of from about 50 to about 250 grams of A80438 compound per ton of feed are recommended for treating swine suffering from dysentery.These amounts provide from about 1 to about 5 mg kg of body weight per day prophylactic treatment or from about 2.5 to about 12.5 mg kg of body weight per day treatment of infected animal . When added to the drinking water, amounts of from about 0.04 to about 0.2 g prophylactic or from about 0.2 to about 1 g therapeutic of A80438 compound per gallon of water are recommended. This invention further relates to feed compositions for treating swine dysentery comprising swine ration and an effective amount of an A80438 compound.As discussed supra, an effective amount is typically one in the range of from about 20 to about 250 grams ofA80438 compound per ton of feed. The A80438 compounds are active against polio virus. For example, tissue culture tests show thatA80438 is active against Polio III virus at a level of 2000 mcg mL. Antibiotic A80438 exhibits ion transport properties and is, therefore, an ionophore ion bearer see B. C. Pressman in Inorganic Biochemistry , G. L.Eichhorn, Ed. Elsevier, New York, 1973 Vol. 1,Chapter 6 . At a 0.5 mcg mL concentration A80438 showed ionophorous activity its activity with Na , K and Rb was better than that with Cs or Li . At a lower concentration 0.2 mcg mL , A80438 appeared to selectNa over other alkali metal cations. A80438 can be used, therefore, when the selective removal of particular cations is desired. Examples of such uses include the removal and recovery of silver ions from solutions in photography, the removal of toxic cations from industrial waste streams before such streams are discharged to the environment, and desalinization of sea water. A80438 can be used as one component of an ion specific electrode see 0. Kedem, et al., U.S.Patent 3,753,887, Aug. 21, 1973 . A80438 alters the cation permeability of both natural and artificial membranes. A80438 can be used, therefore, as a component in a membrane used for the selective transport of cations against a concentration gradient. One potential application of this property is in recovery of heavy and precious metals on a commercial basis see E. L. Cussler, D. F. Evans, and Sister M. A.Matesick, Science 172, 377 1971 . In yet another aspect, A80438 is active as an inhibitor of the enzyme ATPase. ATPase, an alkalimetal sensitive enzyme found in cell membranes, is involved in the energy necessary for active transport. Active transport refers to the energy requiring series of operations whereby intracellular and extracellular fluids maintain their compositions. Inhibitors ofATPase reduce the energy required for active transport.In vitro tests have shown that A80438 inhibits mitochondrial ATPase with a half effective concentration IC50 of 0.5 mcg mL. The A80438 compounds are also potential cardiotonic agents. The A80438 compounds can be administered to animals orally or parenterally. The most practical way to administer the A80438 compounds is by formulation into the feed supply. A variety of feeds, including the common dry feeds, liquid feeds, and pelleted feeds, may be used. Although the preferred method of administration is by mixing it with the animals feed, it can also be administered in other ways, for example, tablets, drenches, boluses, or capsules. Each individual dosage unit should contain a quantity of A80438 compound directly related to the proper daily dose for the animal to be treated. The methods of formulating drugs into animal feeds are well known. A preferred method is to make a concentrated drug premix which in turn is used to prepare medicated feeds. Typical premixes may contain from about 1 to about 200 grams of drug per pound of premix. Premixes may be either liquid or solid preparations. The final formulation of feeds for animals will depend upon the amount of drug to be administered.The common methods of formulating, mixing, an pelleting feeds may be used to prepare feeds containing an A80438 compound. The A80438 compounds may be formulated for parenteral administration by methods recognized in the veterinary pharmaceutical art. Effective injectable compositions containing the A80438 compounds may be in either suspension or solution form. In the solution form, the A80438 compound is dissolved in a physiologically acceptable carrier. Such carriers comprise a suitable solvent, preservatives such as benzyl alcohol, if needed, and buffers. Useful solvents include, for example, alcohols, glycols, or inert oils such as vegetable oils or highly refined mineral oils. Injectable suspension compositions are prepared using a nonsolvent for the compound with adjuvants, as a carrier. The nonsolvent can be, for example, water or a glycol such as polyethylene glycol. Suitable physiologically acceptable adjuvants are necessary to keep the compound suspended in suspension compositions. The adjuvants may be chosen from among thickeners such as carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, and the alginates. Many surfactants are also useful for suspending the compounds. Lecithin, alkylphenol polyethylene oxide adducts, naphthalenesulfonates, alkylbenzenesulfonates, and the polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters are useful suspending agents in liquid nonsolvents. Many substances which affect the hydrophilicity, density, and surface tension of the liquid nonsolvent can assist in making injectable suspensions in individual cases. For example, silicone antifoams, glycols, sorbitol, and sugars can be useful suspending agents.
