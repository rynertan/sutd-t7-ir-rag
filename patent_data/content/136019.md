# DRAINAGE BAG

## Abstract
The invention relates to a drainage bag primarily for urine but also for other liquid drainage, and particularly although not exclusively to a urostomy bag. There has long been a problem in draining urine bags. Users who are not dexterous, and particularly those who are old or infirm, find it difficult to satisfactorily manipulate present bag emptying arrangements when emptying the bag. Present empty ing arrangements involve a plug and tube, or a folding tube with a clip, or a valve or tap. It is often difficult to aim the bag or tap 10 outlet directly into the eventual urine receptacle. These problems are largely or wholly overcome by providing siphon tube for emptying a drainage bag.
