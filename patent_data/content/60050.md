# Fluidized catalytic cracking regeneration process.

## Abstract
In a fluid catalytic cracking process, the regeneration temperature can be eliminated as an operating constraint, catalyst losses can be held constant or reduced, the amount of residual carbon on the regnerated catalyst can be reduced and the coke burning capacity of the regenerator can be increased by the combination of increasing the oxygen content of the air supplied to the regenerator and cooling the catalyst to maintain the regeneration temperature.
