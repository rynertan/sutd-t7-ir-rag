# Electric socket terminal.

## Abstract
An electric socket terminal has elongated resilient socket 14 comprising two axially spaced split tubes 22, 24 intercon nected by a circumferential array of juxtaposed spring steps 26, and means 34 for retaining the electric socket terminal in a cavity 30 of an insulator block 32. The retaining means 34 is disposed alongside the elongated resilient socket, and includes a U shaped guard 38 and a resilient latch tang 36. The U shaped guard has axially spaced legs 40, 42 which are integrally attached to the respective split tubes, and the resilient latch tang is integrally attached at one end to one 40 of the legs of the U shaped guard and extends generally axially of the elongated resilient socket.
