# Flexible power transmission belt and power transmission system.

## Abstract
A flexible power transmission belt having a plurality of teeth 13 each of which has a pair of arcuate convex flank portions 21, 22 which in longitudinal cross section closely approximate to an arc of a circle. Each tooth exhibits a height H to width W relationship within a predetermined range, and the arcuate flanks each have a pressure angle Î± within a predetermined range. The belt is preferably used in combination with a toothed pulley whose teeth are substan tially conjugate to the belt teeth and whose cavities between the teeth have a height to width relationship within another predetermined range and have concave flanks exhibiting a pressure angle in still another predetermined range, said belt tooth width being approximately 0.98 of the pulley cavity width so as to provide a high torque positive drive power transmission system having very low backlash.
