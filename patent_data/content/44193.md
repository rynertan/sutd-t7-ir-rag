# Methods for preparing tube sheets for permeators having hollow fiber membranes.

## Abstract
A high degree of openness to the bores of hollow fiber membranes in a tube sheet can be achieved by impacting the region of the tube sheet at which hollow fiber membranes terminate 24 with a particulate abrasive having an average maximum dimension of less than about 70 percent of the minimum dimension of the bores of the hollow fiber membranes. The particulate abrasive is impacted on the tube sheet at a velocity sufficient to erode the surface of the hollow fiber membranes.
