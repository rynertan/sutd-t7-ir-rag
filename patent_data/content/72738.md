# Disposable autotransfusion device.

## Abstract
An autotransfusion device 10 for colecting blood from a pool in a patient and for subsequently returning the collected blood to the circulatory system of the patient is disclosed. The device includes a liquid collection chamber 66 having a movable wall 30 and a stationary wall 14 . The liquid collection chamber is connected to the pool of blood by an aspirator and to a suction source to draw the blood into the collection chamber. After the collection chamber is filled to the capacity desired, a compressed spring 82 is released to urge the movable wall toward the stationary wall. The blood is forced out of the collection chamber by the compressed spring and back to the circula tory system of the patient.
