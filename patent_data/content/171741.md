# NMR Spectroscopy body probes with at least one surface coil.

## Abstract
An NMR spectroscopy body probe is comprised of at least one surface coil, each coil having at leat one turn and positioned adjacent to a first surface of an insulative member an electric field reducing shield is fabricated upon the other surface of the relatively flexible substrate. The shield surface of the probe is to be positioned closest to the sample. A plurality of surface coil bearing substrates can be stacked, one adjacent to the other with the planes thereof substantially parallel to each other and to the plane of the electric field shield, and with each individual surface coil being separately turnable to a differet nuclei species reso nance frequency. Each surface coil can be utilized for both transmission and reception, or can be used for only recep tion of the re radiated signal from the sample, with a separate excitation coil being provided with a radius sub stantially greater than the average radius of the receiver surface coil and positioned in the plane of any of the at least one receiving surface coils.
