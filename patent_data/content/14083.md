## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT WATER SOLUBLE POLYMERS This invention is concerned with the preparation of low molecular weight polymers, polymers produced thereby and their use as scale inhibitors. When a polymer, such as polyacrylic acid, is prepared, one method of preparation is the use of a redox catalyst system initiator and reducing agent . Because it is believed that the use of a redox catalyst system will result in a high molecular weight polymer e.g. in excess of a molecular weight of 50,000 , when a low molecular weight polymer is desired, a chain transfer agent, such as a mercaptan, is incorporated during the polymerization reaction to control the molecular weight and to obtain low molecular weight materials. The use of mercaptans to control molecular weight is expensive and the mercaptan odor is undesirable and permeates the resultant product. U.S. Patent 3,635,915 discloses a copolymer of maleic acid and acrylic acid prepared by polymerizing a mixture of the monomers in water in the presence of a redox polymerization catalyst system. This patent teaches that the polymerization reaction may be terminated in order to obtain products having desired viscosities by introducing short stopping agents when the desired extent of polymerization has been obtained. The short stopping agents which are set forth are methyldithiocarbamic acid, hydroquinone and, when a peroxide or persulfate is utilized as a catalyst, sodium bisulfite is utilized as the short stopping agent. U.S. Patent 3,635,915 also teaches that copolymers of maleic acid and acrylic acid may be prepared using a thermal polymerization process. In this thermal process the catalyst has a short half life at elevated temperatures so that it will decompose at such temperatures and supply the free radicals necessary for the polymerization reaction. The thermal process of U.S. Patent 3,635,915 is ineffective in preparing low molecular weight polymers without the use of a chain transfer agent. Additionally, in order to prepare polymers of exceedingly low molecular weights, excessively large amounts of the thermally decomposable catalyst and of the chain transfer agent must be used. These excessive amounts of catalyst and chain transfer agent render this thermal process economically unsound. U.S. Patent 3,509,114 is directed to the polymerization ofwater soluble acrylic monomers in aqueous solution and discloses that a redox catalyst system may be used to prepare high molecular weight acrylic polymers. U.S. Patent 4,024,099 is directed to the preparation of very high molecular weight, water soluble acidic polymers using a redox catalyst system and a methylolamide or formaldehyde reagent. The patent sets forth that high catalyst to monomer ratios in polymerization reactions cause lower molecular weights in the resulting polymer. The patent also teaches that the reducing agent of theredox catalyst system may be a metal salt such as ferrous sulfate and that the reducing reagents are used in amounts approximately equivalent to that of the peroxy catalyst. The processes described in U.S. Patent 3,635,915 3,509,114 and 4,024,099 are unsuitable for preparing water soluble low molecular weight polymers either because they are more expensive processes than the present invention or they result in the preparation of high molecular weight polymers. We have now found a process for the preparation of a water soluble low molecular weight homopolymer or copolymer, as defined herein, wherein the catalyst system is used to control the molecular weight of the resultant polymer. In this invention the catalyst comprises an initiator, a metal salt, and, in some embodiments, a reducing agent and the molar ratio of these components and the amount of initiator is used to control the molecular weight of the resultant polymer. This invention provides a process for the preparation of low molecular weight, water soluble polymer without using a mercaptan or other chain transfer agent to control the molecular weight. According to this invention there is provided a process for preparing a water soluble polymer having a molecular weight of up to about 50,000, which comprises reacting, in an aqueous solution system at a temperature of up to the boiling point of said system, a water soluble monomer selected from the class consisting of a acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, acrylamide, methacrylamide, acrolein, methacrolein, N vinyl pyrollidone, alkylpolyalkoxyacrylate and methacrylate, acryloxypropionic acid, and mixtures thereof and b water soluble comonomers of one or more of the monomers of a with from about 5 508 by weight of the total monomers present of a comonomer selected from the class consisting of itaconic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, hydroxyethylmethacrylate, hydroxypropylmethacrylate, hydroxyethylacrylate, hydroxypropylacrylate, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, dimethylaminoethyl acrylate, dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, t butylaminoethyl acrylate, 4 vinyl pyridine, betahydroxyethyldimethylaminoethyl methacrylate salt, t butylaminoethyl methacrylate, and mixtures thereof, in the presence of a catalyst system which comprises an initiator and a metal salt wherein the molar ratio of initiator to metal ion is from about 10 1 to about 5000 1, such as from about 10 1 to 150 1 or from about 150 1 to about 5000 1, and the initiator is present in an amount of from about 0.5 weight percent to about 35 weight percent based on the weight of monomer present. In one embodiment of the invention the catalyst system also contains a reducing agent and the molar ratio of initiator to reducing agent is from about 0.5 1 to about 20 1, such as 1 1 to 20 1. It has been surprisingly found that water soluble polymers or copolymers having a molecular weight of up to about 50,000 can be prepared in an aqueous solution system and that the molecular weight of the resultant polymer can be controlled if the catalyst system comprises an initiator, a metal salt, and optionally a reducing agent wherein the molar ratio of these components and the amount of initiator have certain values. In one embodiment of this invention the catalyst system comprises initiator and metal salt wherein the molar ratio of initiator to metal ion is from about 10 1 to about 150 1, such as from 40 1 to 80 1. While such a system is useful we have found that the amount of metal remaining in the final product can lead to undesirable metal deposition in certain applications, such as under pH conditions of above about 10. In another embodiment such drawbacks may be avoided with a catalyst system comprising initiator, metal salt and reducing agent wherein the molar ratio of initiator to metal ion is from about 150 1 to about 5000 1, preferably from 400 1 to 3000 1, such as from 400 1 to 2000 1 and the molar ratio of initiator to reducing agent is from about 0.5 1 to about 20 1, preferably from about 1 1 to 20 1, such as from 2 1 to 10 1. In the specification and claims, unless otherwise specified, all percentages are percent by weight based on the weight of monomer present. The catalyst system comprises a water soluble initiator, a water soluble reducing agent and a water soluble metal salt. The term water soluble used in describing the initiator, reducing agent and the metal salt means that they are completely soluble, in the amounts used, in the aqueous solution system in which the water soluble polymers or copolymers are prepared. Thus, a sparingly soluble metal salt such as cuprous bromide may be used because the amount of metal salt used may be small. The total amount of the initiator present may vary from about 0.5 weight percent to about 35 weight percent based on the weight of monomer present and preferably from about 1 weight percent to about 20 weight percent. Although more than about 35 may be used, the use of such greater amount of initiator is economically unwarranted.Although less than 0.58 of initiator may be used, the use of such lesser amounts is not recommended because the resultant polymer may have a molecular weight in excess of 50,000. It is preferred that the initiator be present in an amount of from about 1 to about 20 because excellent results have been obtained at such preferred range. Among the water soluble initiators which may be used are hydrogen peroxide, hydroperoxides such as t butylhydroperoxide, sodium, potassium and ammonium persulfate, barium persulfate, acetyl peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, and the like. The water soluble metal salt is present as part of the catalyst system in an amount such that the molar ratio of initiator to metal ion is as specified. If the molar ratio of initiator to metal ion exceeds about 5000 1, then utilization of the initiator in the polymerization reaction may be poor and control of the molecular weight of the product polymer may be lost. Among the water soluble metal salts which may be used are the cupric and cuprous salts, and the water soluble salts of iron, manganese, cobalt, chromium, silver, gold, titanium, lead, cerium, such as the sulfates, chlorides, acetates, nitrates, nitrites, and phosphates and the like. Exemplary of the metal salts are cupric sulfate pentahydrate, ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, cuprous acetate, ferrous acetate, manganese acetate, cerium IV sulfate, titanium III chloride, titanium IV chloride, lead II acetate, lead IV acetate, cupric acetate, ferric acetate hydroxide, ferrous and ferric chloride, ferrous and ferric phosphate, cuprous and cupric chloride, cuprous and cupric bromide, cupric nitrate, ferric sulfate, manganese bromide, manganese chloride, cobalt II acetate, cobalt II chloride, cobalt II nitrate, cobalt II sulfate, cerium III chloride, cerium III nitrate, cerium III sulfate, manganese nitrate, manganese sulfate, lead II chloride, lead II nitrate, and the like. the When water soluble reducing agent is present as part of the catalyst system the amount is such that the molar ratio of initiator to reducing agent is from about 0.5 1 to about 20 1. A ratio of less than about 0.5 1 may not be desired because the degree of monomer conversion may be adversely affected and control of the molecular weight of the product polymer may be diminished. If, however, the molar ratio of initiator to reducing agent exceeds about 20 1, then utilization of the initiator is less efficient and some control over the molecular weight of the product polymer may be lost. The water soluble reducing agents which may be used are those reducing agents capable of changing the oxidation state of the metal ion present from a higher oxidation level to a lower oxidation level. Among the water soluble reducing agents which may be used are hypophosphorous acid and salts thereof such as sodium hypophosphite, invert sugars such as D fructose and D glucose, sodium bisulfite, thiourea dioxide, hydrazine, sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, sodium hydrosulfite, sodium metabisulfite, isoascorbic acid, sodium hyponitrite, sodium sulfite, hydroxylamine hydrochloride, thiourea, and the like. In a preferred embodiment, a water soluble tertiary amine may be incorporated as part of the catalyst system. The tertiary amine is used to enhance the control of the molecular weight of the desired polymers. Even if a tertiary amine is only sparingly soluble in water, it may be used as part of the reaction system provided that the amine used is soluble in the reaction system in the amount utilized. The tertiary amine may be used in very minor amounts. If a tertiary amine is to be present, it may be used in a molar ratio of up to about 1 of amine to 10 of initiator A molar ratio of 1 amine to 100 of initiator may also be used. Although a molar ratio of more than 1 amine to 10 of initiator may be used, there is no particular advantage to using such excessive amounts. If a molar ratio of less than 1 of the amine to 100 of the initiator is used, the beneficial effects of the amine toward molecular weight control tends to be diminished. Among the tertiary amines which may be used are the aromatic, aliphatic and beterocyclic amines, alkanol amines, tertiary aminoacids, cycloaliphatic amines, and the like. Exemplary of such tertiary amines are triethanolamine, dimethylamino ethanol, triethylamine, tripropylamine, tributylamine, tribenzylamine, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, triphenylamine, triisopropanolamine, N,N dimethyl ethanolamine, N,N diethyl ethanolamine, N,N diisopropyl ethanolamine,N methyl diethanolamine, N,N,N ,N tetramethyl l,3 butane diamine, N,N,N ,N tetramethyl 1,6 hexane diamine, pyridine, 2 acetylpyridine, 2 picoline, ethyl picolinate, N methylpiperidine, l methyl 5 oxo 3pyrrolidine carboxylic acid, picolinic acid, quinaldic acid, and the like. The water soluble monomers which may be used in practicing this invention are acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, acrylamide, acrolein, methacrolein, methacrylamide, N vinyl pyrollidone, methoxypolyethoxy acrylate and methacrylate having from 3 to 35 ethoxy groups, acryloxypropionic acid, and mixtures thereof.These water soluble monomers may be used to prepare water soluble homopolymers or these monomers may be mixed with one another in any proportion to prepare water soluble copolymers. Other comonomers, which, if used as the sole monomer, would not result in a water soluble polymer may be used, in an amount of from about 5 508 by weight of the total monomers present, with one or more of the monomers from which homopolymers may be prepared.Among the comonomers which may be used are itaconic acid, fumaric acid, hydroxyethylmethacrylate hydroxypropylmethacrylate, hydroxyethylacrylate, hydroxypropylacrylate, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, 4 vinyl pyridine, beta hydroxyethyldimethylaminoethyl methacrylate salt, dimethylaminoethyl acrylate, dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, t butylaminoethyl acrylate, t butylaminoethyl methacrylate, and mixtures thereof. Other comonomers, normally not considered as water soluble, may also be used in limited amounts of up to about 5 by weight of the total monomers present as long as the resultant polymer is water soluble. Among these comonomers may be mentioned vinyl acetate, styrene, vinyl toluene, alpha methyl styrene, and the like and acrylate and methacrylate esters such as methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, ethyl methacrylate, n propyl acrylate, n propyl methacrylate, isopropyl acrylate, isopropyl methacrylate, n butyl acrylate, n butyl methacrylate, secondary butyl acrylate, secondary butyl methacrylate, isobutyl acrylate, isobutyl methacrylate, ethylhexyl acrylate, ethylhexyl methacrylate, lauryl acrylate, lauryl methacrylate, stearyl acrylate, stearyl methacrylate,N,N dialkylacrylamides such as N,N diethylacrylamide and N alkylacrylamide such as N methylacrylamide, and the like. In some instances, more than 5 of these comonomers may be used. The term water soluble , as used herein in describing the water soluble polymers and copolymers means total miscibility of the polymer or copolymer with water. In practicing the process of this invention, the polymerization may be carried out at any temperature above the freezing point of the reaction solution to below the boiling point of such solution at the pressure used, which may be above or below atmospheric pressure. It is preferred, however, to conduct the polymerization reaction at atmospheric pressure and at a temperature of from about 70 C to about 100at for reasons of convenience. The polymerization reaction is conducted until all of the monomer has been added and complete polymerization has taken place as indicted by the solids content of the solution. The amount of monomer present in the solution may vary from about 10 by weight to about 90 by weight based on the total weight of the reaction solution. If less than 10 of monomer is present, then the reaction will take place at a slow rate which is inconvenient. Amounts of monomer in excess of about 90 are not desired because the resultant solution may be too viscous so as to render it impractical to handle. The polymerization process is practiced by dissolving the metal salt and amine, if present, in water and adding the catalyst initiator and reducing agent dropwise and the monomer slowly to the reaction vessel containing the metal salt and amine. Because the polymerization reaction is often exothermic in nature, by adding the monomer slowly and the catalyst initiator and reducing agent dropwise, an overly vigorous exotherm is avoided The reaction is considered substantially complete when all of the monomer has been added and the exothermic nature of the reaction has ceased. Although a chain transfer agent is not needed in practising the process of this invention, such chain transfer agent may be used in conjunction with the process of this invention to further lower the molecular weight of a polymer prepared by the process of the present invention. Occasionally, the polymerization process will produce an insufficient initial exotherm so that the polymerization reaction will be slow. If this happens, then an external heat is supplied to provide the initial exotherm necessary for the proper rate of reaction. The initial exotherm for an otherwise slow reaction may be supplied by externally heating the reaction vessel, or by chemically providing the initial exotherm. Preferred products of the process of the invention are homopolymers of acrylic and methacrylic acid and acrylamide. Polymer prepared by the process of this invention, such as polyacrylic acid, may be used as a scale inhibitor. After the water soluble polymer has been prepared, if it is an acid polymer, it may, if desired, be neutralized with an inorganic or organic base. Among the bases which may be used are sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, triethanolamine, dimethylamino ethanol, ethanolamine, benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide, and the like. The base used should be selected so that the resultant salt is water soluble, i.e. completely miscible with water. The manner of neutralizing a polymeric acid is well known in the art and the invention is not to be construed as limited to any particular method of neutralizing a polymeric acid. Some preferred embodiments of the invention will now be more particularly described in and by the following examples, in which all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. Example 1 To a 2 liter round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a condenser arranged to reflux, a thermometer and an inlet for gradual addition of monomer and initiator is added 12.25 grams of cupric sulfate pentahydrate 25 grams of triethanolamine and 125 grams of water.
