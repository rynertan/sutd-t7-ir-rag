# Xerographic copier.

## Abstract
A xerographic copier is arranged to produce, on the imaging element 26 a developed test area 30 corresponding to an original of uniform colour and density bordered by an unimaged area 28 . The reflectivity of both areas are sensed to provide control signals to alter either developer bias or illumination intensity. The alteration is carried out such as to maintain a vector, comprising the image voltage on the imaging element corresponding to the latent image of the test area minus the developer bias voltage, contant. The test area is produced in a cycle either at the end of a multiple copy run or in a cycle interrupting a lengthy multiple copy run.
