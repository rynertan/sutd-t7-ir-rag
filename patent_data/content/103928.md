# Line synchronizing circuit for a picture display device.

## Abstract
A line synchronizing circuit for a picture display device comprising a control loop for controlling a line oscillator. An incoming line synchronizing signal and also a reference signal generated by the oscillator are applied to a phase discriminator. The output signal of the phase discriminator is smoothed to obtain the control voltage for the oscillator. Pull in of the control loop is established by means of a coincidence detector. Prior to that an edge of the reference signal is compared with the centre instant of a line synchro nizing pulse. When the control loop is in the pulled in state it is changed by the coincidence detector to compare the leading edge of a line synchronizing pulse to the centre instant between the said edge of the reference signal and its first preceding edge.
