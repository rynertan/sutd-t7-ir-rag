# Crop or product carriers.

## Abstract
A trailer is provided in the form of a container having side walls 20, 21, 22 and a movable base 23 which can be raised and lowered within the side walls under control of a ram 25 . Thus the height of the base can be adjusted as a crop or product begins to fill the space available above the base in a raised position and by this means the extent of drop of the crop or product into the container can be made as small as possible so that the possibility of damage is significantly reduced. The base can be supported by scissor arms 27, 28 and can also be locked in the lower position to the container walls so that when the ram 25 is operated the walls and base will be tilted together about a pivot 32 for unloading.
