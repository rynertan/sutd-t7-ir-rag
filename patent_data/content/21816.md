# Method and system of detecting pinholes in hollow fibres.

## Abstract
A method of and a system for detecting pinholes in hollow fibers by passing a liquid filling fiber 1 into a zone 15 of pressurised gas wherein the pressure of a gas is higher than that of a liquid inside the hollow fiber 1 so that bubbles 5 may be injected through pinholes 3, 4 contained in said hollow fiber 1 and then passing the fiber 1 through a bubble detector 16, 37 . The system can be operated continuously with the pinhole detector 16, 37 being between a device 10 for continuously feeding the hollow fiber 1 and a device 11 for winding up said hollow fiber 1 .
