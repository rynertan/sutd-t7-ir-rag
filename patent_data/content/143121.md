# LOW VISCOSITY ADDUCTS OF A POLYCAPROLACTONE POLYOL AND A POLYEPOXIDE

## Abstract
This invention is directed to adducts of a polycaprolac tone polyol and a polyepoxide comprising the reaction product of at least one Polycaprolactone polyol and a poly epoxide containing two or more epoxy groups per molecule in a molar ratio of polycaprolactone polyol to polyepoxide of from about 2 1 to about 3 1, said adducts having an oxirane content of less than about 0.10 percent and a viscos ity of less than about 3700 centistokes at 54.5 C. The ad ducts are useful in the formulation of high solids coating compositions, polyurethane elastomers, inks, sealants, ad hesives and the like.
