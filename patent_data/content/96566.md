## Description
LAUNDRY ADDITIVE PRODUCTS Brian Edward Talkes Stephen Paul Cassidy Technical Field This invention relates to laundry additive products.In particular, it relates to laundry additive products for cleaning clothes or other fabrics or for providing an adjunct laundering benefit, the additive product comprising a water insoluble substrate and a laundry additive composition coated on or impregnated into the substrate. Background Laundry additive products based on water insoluble substrates are now well known in the art. For example,US A 3,422,692, Gaiser, issued May 6 1969 discloses a method for softening and controlling static on fabrics in a laundry washing machine or dryer using a fabric conditioning composition coated on a substrate. UK A 1,586,769 teaches a laundry additive product containing an organic peroxy compound precursor combined with a solid article, particularly a sheet like, water insoluble substrate.US A 4,170,565, Flesher et al, relates to an article for cleaning fabrics yielding sequential release of surface active components, consisting of a surface active composition contained between two layers of water insoluble substrate of defined air permeability. A key constraint of a substrate based laundry additive product, particularly for use as a detergent or detergent additive for washing clothes and the like, is the ability to load a relatively large amount of the laundry additive composition onto the substrate and simultaneously to achieve rapid and complete release of the additive composition during the course of the laundering operation. This is to be contrasted with articles of the cleaning cloth variety used in the washing and scrubbing of hard surfaces such as dishes and counter tops and which rely on physical rubbing and scrubbing during use to assure the release of the proper amount of cleansing composition for the cleaning operation.Such articles are generally designed for multiple repeated use and are formulated, therefore, to release only a snall proportion of the total cleaning composition during any single use of the article. To achieve rapid release of laundry additive composition, it is generally found desirable to utilize a substrate of low basis weight. Particularly acceptable from this viewpoint are single layer substrates impregnated with or carrying a coating of the laundry additive composition.As a result of high loading and low substrate basis weight, therefore, laundry additive products having optimum performance for general detergency use inevitably have a high composition substrate weight ratio referred to herein as loading ratio . From the viewpoint of processing, product aesthetics, and storage characteristics, however, designing a laundry additive product having a high loading ratio raises a number of intractible problems. First and foremost, the flexibility of the substrate rapidly diminishes at high loading ratio and the product becomes increasingly rigid and board like. Not only is this disliked by consumers but it also raises processing problems associated with composition flaking from the sheet, and manufacturing and packaging problems associated with folding the article into a form which is compact and convenient for use. Where, on the other hand, the additive composition is made sufficiently soft and plastic to mitigate flexbility problems, the articles become quite sticky and uncomfortable to touch and associated problems of handling and storage blocking phenomena etc become increasingly important. It has now been found that by selecting certain laundry additive compositions of defined melting characterstics and certain sheet like apertured substrates of defined aperture size and density and by coating the substrate so as to cover and fill only a defined proportion of the substrate apertures, laundry additive products can be provided which simultaneously meet the mutual constraints of high loading, good release characteristics, and excellent flexiblity and product feel characteristics. The present invention thus provides a laund product having a high composition substrate ratio with excellent product flexibility characteristic not sticky to handle and which is easy to manufacture, use and store, and which can be used in a laundering operation to clean clothes and other fabrics effectively and conveniently or to provide additional laundering ben Summary of the Invention According to the present invention, there is a laundry additive product comprising a a solid laundry additive composition having a softening temperature of at least about 35 C and comprising at least about 40 of a water soluble or water dispersible matrix of organic materials lavin c melting completion temperature of less than 850C, and b a flexible, sheet like apertured substrate having aperture density of from about 10 to abo apertures per sq cm of sheet and wherein 5 Ine apertures, on average, have a width of from about 0.5mm to about 5mm and a length of from about 0.8mm to about 5mm, the substrate carrying a water releasable coating of the laundry additive composition on areas of uncoated apertures and areas where coating covers the apertures and extends betwee opposing surfaces of the substrate, the ratio of eas of uncoated to coated apertures beinq in the range from about 15 1 to about 1 3 and wherein the ratio of composition substrate is at least about With regard to the substrate, this preferably as an aperture density of from about 13 to about 26, more preferably from about 16 to about 23 apertures per so sheet, a basis weight of from about 10 to about 70 metre, more preferably from about 20 to about 5 a metre and a hydrophobic binder resins content of from 12 to about 25 , more preferably from about 16 to about 22 by weight of total substrate.

The substrate apertures herein can be elongate in shape for example, generally elliptical or diamond shaped in which case the apertures preferably have a width of from about 0.8mm to about 1.5mm and a length of from about 2mm to about 3.5mm.In preferred embodiments, however, the apertures are generally square shaped with a side dimension of from about 1 to 2.5mm. As used herein, length refers to the dimension of the principal ie longest longitudinal axis, and width1 is the maximum dimension perpendicular to this axis.

Preferred cationic surfactants have melting onset temperatures of at least about 350C and can form either part of the organic binding agent or can be dispersed in the organic matrix.Preferred anionic surfactants have melting completion temperatures in excess of about 1000C and are dispersed in the organic matrix. Other functional solid imgredients can also be present as a dispersion in the organic matrix, especially inorganic or organic peroxy bleaches which preferably comprise at least about 5 by weight of additive composition, and or organic peroxy acid bleach precursors which preferably comprise at least about 2 by weight of additive composition. Other suitable functional ingredients include detergency enzymes, fluorescers, photoactivators, sequestrants, bleaching catalysts, and suds controlling agents. The laundry additive products of the invention will now be discussed in detail. Preferred substrates for use herein are apertured nonwoven fabrics which can generally be defined as adhesively bonded fibrous or filamentous products, having a web or carded fibre structure where the fibre strength is suitable to allow carding or comprising fibrous mats, in which the fibres or filaments are distributed haphazardly or in random array i.e. an array of fibres in a carded web wherein partial orientation of the fibres is frequently present as well as a completely haphazard distributional orientation or substantially aligned. The fibres or filaments can be natural e.g. wool, silk, wood pulp, jute, hemp, cotton, linen, sisal, or ramie , synthetic e.g.rayon, cellulose, ester, polyvinyl derivatives, polyolefins, polyamides, or polyesters or mixtures of any of the above. Generally, non woven cloths are made by air or water laying processes in which the fibres or filaments are first cut to desired lengths from long strands, passed into a water or air stream, and then deposited onto a screen through which the fibre laden air or water is passed. The deposited fibres or filaments are then adhesively bonded together, dried, cured and otherwise treated as desired to form the non woven cloth. Preferably, the non woven cloth is made from cellulosic fibres, particularly from regenerated cellulose or rayon, which are lubricated with standard textile lubricant such as sodium oleate. Preferably the fibres are from about 4 to about 50 mm, especially from about 8mm to about 20mm, in length and are from about 1 to about 5 denier Denier is an internationally recognised unit in yarn measure, corresponding to the weight in grams of a 9,000 meter length of yarn . preferably the fibres are at least partially orientated haphazardly, particularly substantially haphazardly, and are adhesively bonded together with hydrophobic or substantially hydrophobic binder resin, particularly with a nonionic self crosslinking acrylic polymer or polymers.In highly preferred embodiments, the cloth comprises from about 75 to about 88 , especially from about 78 to about 84 fibre and from about 12 to about 25 , especially from about 16 to about 22 hydrophobic binder resin polymer by weight and has a basis weight of from about 10 to about 70, preferably from 20 to 50 g m2.Suitable hydrophobic binder rins are ethylacrylate resins such as Primal Via24 Rhoplex HA8 and HA16 Rohm and Haas,Inc and mixtures thereof. The substrate apertures, which extend between opposite surfaces of the substrate, are normally in a pattern and are formed during lay down of the fibres to produce the substrate. Exemplary apertured non woven substrates are disclosed in US Patent Nos. 3,741,724, 3,930,086 and 3,750,237. An example of an apertured non woven substrate suitable herein is a regenerated cellulose sheet of 1.5 denier fibres bonded with Rhoplex HA 8 binder fibre binder ratio of about 77 23 having a basis weight of about 35 g m2 and about 17 apertures cm2. The apertures are generally ellipitical in shape and are in side by side arrangement. The apertures have a width of about 0.9mm and a length of about 2.5mm measured in a relaxed condition.Another highly preferred substrate based on 1.5 denier regenerated cellulose fibres with Rhoplex HA8 binder has a fibre binder ration of about 82 18, a basis weight of about 35g m2, and about 22 apertures cm2. In this example, the apertures are generally square shaped with a width relaxed of about l.lmm. The apertures are again disposed in side by side arrangement. The size and shape of the substrate sheet for each unit of product is a matter of choice and is determined principally by factors associated with the convenience of its use. Thus the sheet should not be so small as to become trapped in the crevices of the machine or the clothes being washed or so large as to be awkward to package and dispense from the container in which it is sold. For the purposes of the present invention sheets ranging in plan area from about 130 cm2 to about 1300 cm2 are acceptable, the preferred area lying in the range of from about 520 cm2 to about 780 elm2. Turning to the laundry additive composition, this is in solid form at ambient temperatures 250C and below and preferably has a softening temperature of at least about 350 C, more preferably at least about 400C, especially at least about 500C. By softening temperature is meant the temperature at which there is transition fron plastic flow to viscous flow properties at ambient temperatures, therefore, the composition takes the form Or a plastic solid having a non zero yield stress. The hardness of the compositions at ambient temperatures can be determined by standard methods, for example, by the penetrometer based technique of IP49 or the technically equivalent ASTM D5 or BS4691 . Thus, laundry additive compositions preferred for use herein have a penetration under a 10g load at 250C after 15 seconds under IP49 of less than about 10 measured in tenths of a millimetre , more preferably less than about 7. The softening temperature of the coposition, on the other hand, is taken herein to be the temperature at which the IP49 15 second penetration exceeds about 30. The laundry additive composition herein comprises a matrix of organic materials having defined melting characteristics. Melting completion temperatures are determined using a Dupont 910 Differential ScanningCalorimeter with Mechanical Cooling Accessory and R90Thermal Analyser as follows. A 5 10 mg sample of the organic material containing no free water or solvent is encapsulated in a hermetically sealed pan with an empty pan as reference. The sample is initially heated until molten and then rapidly cooled at about 20 300C min to 700C.Thermal analysis is then carried out a a heating rate of 100C min using sufficient amplification ofaT signal ie temperature difference between sample and reference vertical axis to obtain an endotherm peak signal baseline noise ratio of better than 10 1. The melting completion temperature is then the temperature corresponding to the intersection of the tangential line at the steepest part of the endotherm curve at the high temperature end of the endotherm, with the horizontal line, parallel to the sample temperature axis, through the highest temperature endotherm peak. The organic materials constituting the matrix have a melting completion temperature of less than about 850C. in addition, the laundry additive products of the invention preferably contain at least about 5 by weight of composition of binding agent defined as organic material having a melting completion temperature of less than 850C, preferably less than about 800C, especially less than about 700C, and a melting onset temperature of at least 350C, preferably at least 400C, especially at least 500 C. The melting onset temperature can once again be determined by thermal analysis as described above and is taken to be the sample temperature at the point of intersection of the base line with a tangent to the steepest part of the endotherm nearest the low temperature end of the endotherm. The laundry additive products of the invention can be supplemented by all manner of laundering and detergency components. Suitably, the additive products can contain from about 58 to about 100 , preferably from about 20 to about 100 , more preferably from about 35 to about 75 of organic detergent selected from anionic, nonionic and cationic surfactants and mixtures thereof.
