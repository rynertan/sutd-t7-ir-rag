# ELECTRON BEAM CURABLE RESIN.

## Abstract
An oligopolyester urethane resin having a urethane bond at each end of a polyester moiety or a polyester polyurethane resin wherein a polyester moiety chain is extended through a urethane bond. The resins have a molecular weight of from about 1,000 to about 50,000, have a double bond at each end of the molecule thereof, and have from about 0.2 to about 30 mol of a metal sulfonate group containing carboxylic acid component based on the whole carboxylic acid component. The resins are particularly suited as a binder for a magnetic coating material for producing magnetic recording medium such as magnetic tape and provides magnetic recording medium having excellent dispersibility, durability, and solvent resistance.
