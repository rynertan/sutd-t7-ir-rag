# An electric switch control unit, more particularly for electric motor driven actuators.

## Abstract
The control unit comprises an input drive shaft 24 which is drivably connected with separate switching mechanisms for operating a close direction switch 61a or an open direction switch 62a . Each switching mechanism comprises an adjustable counter for setting the actuator stroke, the counter including a counter shaft 18 driven by shaft 24 and having counter gears 13, 14 thereon which mesh with counter pinions 12 on a counter pinion shaft 10 . The shaft 10 carries a cam 11 operating a limit cam plate 28 , which actuates an adjustable torque limit shaft 35 carried by a switch actuator 42 so as to actuate the switch 61a when limit operation is selected. Torque operation is obtained from the wormshaft of the actuator through a linkage 103 and a torque member 106 which actuates one or other of the adjustable cams 38 on shaft 36 also carried by the switch actuator 42 . A latch member 49 operable at any time during the stroke of the actuator prevents resetting of the switch actuator 42 until the actuator moves in the opposite direction, the latch member 49 being released by a release drive shaft 48 operable from input drive shaft 24 . A torque switch cut out lever 37 prevents operation of the opposite switch actuator 43 until the actuator moves and the first switch actuator 42 resets.
