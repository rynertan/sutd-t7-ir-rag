# Roll fuser.

## Abstract
An electrophotographic copier machine has a roll fuser, one mating roll of which comprises a thin outer shell 25 which has tapered end sections and is supported centrally on a shaft 26. End plugs 28 are axially movable on the shaft between retracted and engaged positions. The end plugs 28 can be moved axially inward to the engaged positions in which flanges 32 are a close fit in portions 42 in high humidity conditions to provide support for the end sections of the normally concave roll. The plugs 28 can be moved axially outward to the retracted positions in low humidity conditions so that no support is provided until the roll ends are flattened under the pressure of a mating roll and the portions 44 engage the flanges 32.
