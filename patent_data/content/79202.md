# Packaging apparatus method.

## Abstract
A packaging machine includes movable spaced meter ing bars 40 and guide means 49, 51 for supplying groups of articles B from an infeed conveyor 47, 48 to a packaging station and is arranged to tighten a carrier blank about the group of articles while the blank and articles are moved by the metering bars. The machine includes tightening lugs L which engage portions of the blank on each side of the group and which impart a downward tightening force without causing any substantial frictional drag thereto. The tighten ing lugs are constructed and arranged so that they need not move in precisely timed sequence with a blank and an associated group of articles.
