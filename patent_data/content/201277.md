# MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING METHODS AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
Hybrid fast scan magnetic resonance imaging is performed by using, for example, both a two dimensional Fourier trans form 2DFT method using phase encoding prior to data collec tion and an echo planar technique which phase encodes by using an oscillating gradient during data collection. In this hybrid imaging, the amplitude of the oscillating gradient deter mines the time savings achieved in imaging. The hybrid scan has particular application for medical diagnostic imaging since it is advantageous that such imaging be conducted as rapidly as possible.
