# Projectile fuse with selection between direct and delayed ignition.

## Abstract
Arrangement 5 in a fuse 1 for projectile with explosive charge for changing over between direct and delayed ignition of the explosive charge. The arrangement comprises a movable contact member 6 which in an initial position short circuits an electrical igniter 7 which is designed for direct ignition of the explosive charge. A locking member in the form of a pin 14 in an initial orientation of the projectile takes up a position in which the contact member can move under the influence of the accelerational forces effective on the projectile to a second position where the contact member is held by a detent device. With a second orientation of the projectile the pin, as a result of its own weight, drops down to a position where it prevents the contact member 6 moving from the said initial position.
