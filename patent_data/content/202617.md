# A POROUS FILTER MEDIA AND MEMBRANE SUPPORT MEANS

## Abstract
A method for filtering liquid or gaseous materials where the filtration is conducted with a porous filter media prepared from an aqueous wet laid, fiber reinforced composite sheet comprising a heat fusible polymer, reinforcing fibers and a binder. The random fiber composite sheet can be selectively lofted or recompressed to form filter media having controlled porosity. Also, a membrane support is prepared by applying or treating the fiber reinforced composite sheet having con trolled porosity with a discriminating membrane layer.
