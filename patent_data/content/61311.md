# Disconnectable drive for high speed shaft.

## Abstract
A disconnect member 36 is spline connected to one end of the connecting drive shaft 42 of an engine and a driven accessory 22 , and is axially translatable into and out of coupling engagement with the engine. The disconnect member has a spiraled, axially ramped cam surface 56, 58 formed thereon which co operates with a rotatable cam follower 106 selectively movable into engagement there with to axially drive the rotating disconnect member relative to the cam follower, thereby uncoupling the engine from its driven accessory. When the cam follower is disengaged from the cam surface, a reset spring 144 automatically recouples the disconnect member to the engine.
