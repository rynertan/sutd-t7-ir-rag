## Description
LAMINAR GLASS ASSEMBLIES The invention relates to laminar glass assemblies and is particularly, but by no means exclusively, concerned with such assemblies having solar control and or energy saving properties. Assemblies are known comprising a sheet of glass to one surface of which is adhered a plastics film having solar control and or energy saving properties. Such a plastics film may have a metallized or otherwise applied coating which transmits incident sunlight according to the angle of incidence of the sun s rays, the film may provide an ultra violet barrier, and the coating reflects heat back into the building in which the glass is used. Assemblies are also known, commonly referred to as laminated safety glass , which comprise a plastics sheet sandwiched between two sheets of annealed glass to provide strengthened anti splinter glass for safety and anti bandit purposes. Due to the use of annealed glass sheets this avoids the distortion which is obtained with homogeneous toughened glass. The object of the invention is to provide laminar glass assemblies providing improved solar control and or energy saving and or strength properties as compared with known assemblies. According to one aspect of the invention, a laminar glass assembly comprises two sheets of glass with a plastics film disposed between them, the plastics film being adhered to each glass sheet by a layer of adhesive with at least one of the adhesive layers being of considerable thickness in relation to the thickness of said plastics film. Preferably the plastics film is directly adhered to one of the glass sheets by a negligibly thin adhesive layer, and it may be commercially available plastics film provided with a solar control energy saving coating and an adhesive coating. The latter coating is preferably a pressure sensitive adhesive although it may be of a type which is water activated before applying the film to the closely adjacent glass sheet. Such a plastics film is normally applied to the inner surface of a glass window, where it is susceptible to damage and prone to separation from the glass. When positioned between two Zsheets of glass in accordance with the invention it is protected against damage, and the tendency for separation from the glass is overcome. The plastics film is preferably a polyester based film, desirably a stretched polyester film as sold under the trade mark Melinex , with the two adhesive layers of the invention both being polyester compatible adhesives.As already mentioned one adhesive layer is preferably provided by a pre coated pressure sensitive adhesive, and the thicker adhesive layer is preferably a minimum twocomponent poiyester based resin in fill with polyestercompatible adhesive properties and which can be applied to provide a layer of the desired thickness. Such a construction not only provides a stable assembly, with complete protection of the plastics film, but the thicker layer of in fill resin in combination with the plastics film provides a high strength assembly which is highly resistant to penetration and to splintering. According to a more limited aspect of the invention a laminar glass assembly comprises two sheets of annealed glass with a polyester based plastics film disposed between them, the plastics film being directly adhered to one of the sheets of glass by a relatively thin layer of polyester compatible adhesive and being attached to the other sheet of glass by a synthetic resin layer with polyester compatible adhesive properties and which is of considerable thickness as compared with the thickness of said plastics film. Any suitable synthetic resin can be used for the thicker adhesive in fill layer, the principal requirements being that it is compatible with the plastics film and does not break down and yellow under sunlight. To prevent such yellowing a W inhibitor may be mixed into the resin prior to application thereof. In addition to the twocomponent polyester based resin already referred to with a polyester based plastics film, a cold cure two component polyurethane resin and a one part W cured acrylic resin have been found useful in practical realizations of the invention. The plastics film may itself be a laminate of two plastics sheets with a solar control energy saving layer between them. Such plastics films are commercially available with said layer being a metallized layer applied to one of the plastics sheets prior to lamination thereof, by a vacuum deposition or sputtering process. These films, employing polyester plastics sheets, have properties determined by the nature of the intermediate layer and its method of application. They are conveniently classified as either low E film which has low emissivity and operates to retain heat within a building with which it is used, or solar control film which operates to keep the heat from sunlight out of the building. Thus a low E film is in general used in cooler climates, and a solar control film in the sunnier and warmer climates. When the plastics film is a solar control energy saving film, conveniently of bi laminate form, under high intensity sunlight a considerable temperature rise can occur within the assembly of the invention, particularly on the outer side of the film. Thus the assembly should be installed in a building with the thicker adhesive, or resin in fill, layer on the inner side of the plastics film.Furthermore, it is necessary to use a resin which is stable at the elevated temperatures involved, that is up to at least a temperature of the order of 1000F and preferably up to a temperature of 1200F. According to another aspect of the invention, a laminar glass assembly comprises inner and outer sheets of annealed glass with a bi laminate plastics film disposed between them, said film comprising two plastics laminae with an intermediate metallized solar control energy saving layer, the plastics film being adhered to said outer sheet of glass by a relatively thin pre coated adhesive layer and adhered to said inner sheet of glass by a synthetic resin layer which is of considerable thickness as compared with the thickness of said plastics film, said resin being compatible with the plastics film material and stable without tendency to yellow under sunlight and up to a temperature at least of the order of 1000F, and preferably up to a temperature of 1200F. Although an assembly in accordance with the invention conveniently consists of the two sheets of glass, the plastics film and the intervening adhesive layers only, it may comprise three or more sheets of glass with a plastics film similarly disposed between each two adjacent glass sheets. This enables an assembly of extremely high strength to be achieved, for example for use in bandit and bullet proof glass constructions. The glass sheets preferably have a thickness within the range of 2 to 12 mm, with the plastics film having a thickness in the range of 1 to 10 thousandths of an inch 0.025 to 0.254 mm with the lower limit being 3 thousandths of an inch 0.076 mm when strength is a major consideration. The thicker in fill resin layer may have a thickness in the range of 0.1 to 6.0 mm. According to another aspect of the invention, a laminar glass assembly comprises two sheets of glass each of which is bonded through a layer of a polyester compatible adhesive to a polyester based film of plastics material disposed between the two glass sheets. The invention will now be further described with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings which illustrate, by way of example, a laminar glass assembly in accordance with the invention and a specific embodiment thereof. In the drawings Fig. 1 illustrates the assembly in edge view and Fig. 2 similarly illustrates the specific embodiment. The assembly in accordance with the invention which is illustrated in Fig. 1 comprises two sheets 1 and 2 of annealed glass between which is disposed a plastics film 3. The film 3 is directly adhered to the glass sheet 2 by a thin layer 4 of a resin adhesive, which is of negligible thickness so that the film 3 is effectively directly bonded to the glass sheet 2. The film 3 is adhered to the glass sheet 1 through a thick layer of resin adhesive 5, the sheets 1 and 2 and the film 3 being disposed in parallel relationship. For the film 3 a stretched polyester based plastics is conveniently used, such as that sold under the trade mark Melinex , and this may be pre coated with a pressure sensitive adhesive which provides the layer 4.During manufacture the adhesive coated surface of the film 3 is applied to and pressed against the glass sheet 2 with full surface contact, and use of the pre coated plastics film 3 facilitates machine application to the glass sheet 2. The layer 5, which is in fill synthetic resin with polyester compatible adhesive properties and may be of a minimum two component form, is now applied by pouring on to the film 3 which is disposed horizontally for this purpose, and the glass sheet 1 applied to the resin layer 5 to complete the assembly. A cold cure polyurethane resin has been found suitable in practice, as has a single component one part acrylic resin which is cured by W irradiation. The resin used is stable under sunlight, in particular having no tendency to yellowing, and to this end may contain a UV inhibitor. It is also stable in the sense that it will not run, break down or de laminate during normal use of the assembly as a window panel installed in a building. After the resin layer 5 has cured an extremely strong and structurally stable construction is obtained.The resultant laminar assembly is resistant to penetration and splintering, due to the combination of the plastics film 3 with the thick resin layer 5 which provides reinforcement, and the assembly also provides a high degree of fire resistance. These properties are obtained whether or not the film 3 is a clear film. However, the film 3 is preferably of known form with a sputtered or vacuum deposited metallized coating providing solar control and or energy saving properties.In this case the solar control thermal reflection coating is completely protected within the assembly of the invention, with the use of a polyester based film with polyester compatible adhesives providing permanent adhesion at both surfaces of the film 3 so that film separation does not occur. The glass sheets 1 and 2 have a thickness within the range of 2 to 12 mm, the plastics film 3 has a thickness within the range of 1 to 10 thousandths of an inch 0.025 to 0.254 mm , and the resin layer 5 with polyester compatible adhesive properties has a thickness within the range of 0.1 to 6.0 mm. If strength is not a major consideration a thinner plastics film 3 may be used, when the minimum thickness could be 1 thousandth of an inch 0.025 mm or less. In the specific embodiment of Fig. 2 the plastics film 3 is itself a bi laminate a fragment of which is shown to a larger scale in inset view. This pre laminated film 3 comprises two thin polyester sheets 3a and 3b with an intermediate solar control and or energy saving metallic coating 3 which is applied to one of the sheets 3a and 3b prior to lamination thereof. The film 3 is of known form, being commercially available, with the coating 3c applied by a sputtering or vacuum deposition process, being of a nature and application to provide the desired solar control and or energy saving properties. When the assembly has solar control properties an elevated internal temperature is produced under incident sunlight, particularly on the outer side of the film 3.Thus the resin layer 5 is such as to be stable up to temperatures of the order of 1000F, and preferably up to 1200F and the assembly is installed in a building with the glass sheet 2 towards the outside of the building.
