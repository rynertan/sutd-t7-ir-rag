# Improvements in wet electrostatic precipitators.

## Abstract
An improved wet electrostatic precipitator 10 includes several flat collector electrodes 12 and flat discharge electrodes 14 respectively arranged between the collector electrodes. Water or another suitable rinse liquid is distri buted over the operative surfaces of the collector electrodes by a liquid distribution arrangement comprising several tubular distributor members 60 each member including uniformly spaced, tubular overflow nozzles 62 and 63 that project vertically upwardly and that are individually adjust able to provide for uniform flow. The end overflow nozzles 63 adjacent the respective inlets 64 have closed lower ends and circular inlet apertures or bores 94 in their tubular walls 90 and each is oriented so that the aperture 94 generally faces toward the associated distributor member inlet 64 . The construction and orientation of the end nozzles 63 assures adequate flow of rinse liquid from the turbulent flow region of the distributor members, thereby in use avoiding dry spots on the collector electrodes 12 and the resultant sparking that tends to occur at any dry spot.
