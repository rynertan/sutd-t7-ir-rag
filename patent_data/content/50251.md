# Shock absorber with pressure relief mechanism.

## Abstract
A shock absorber with improved shock absorbing characteristics has a piston 100 in which a vortex chamber 118 is formed. The vortex chamber 118 communicates with upper and lower fluid chambers 46, 48 via communication passages 106, 112, 116 . One of the communication passages not shown opens to the vortex chamber 118 tangentially to produce a vortex in the vortex chamber 118 . Within the vortex chamber 118 a member 114 is normally elastically urged to narrow to the area through which the fluid flows. The member 114 is responsive to the fluid pressure exceeding a predetermined value to move against the resilient force in the direction increasing the area allowing fluid flow. A bottom fitting of similar construction and function is also disclosed.
