## Description
S SINGLE AXIS OR SULTI AXiAL APPARATUS FOR DYNAMIC Tq ON LARGE STRUCTURES , The present invention relates to apparatus for performing single axis or multi axial dynamic tests on large structures. The constituent dynamic equations are a very important parameter in the study of incidents in nuclear reactors and dynamically stressed structures in general. A knowledge of these equations is essential not only for homogeneous materials, such as steel, but also for composite structures such as a section of the reactor core or a reinforced concrete structure. A homogeneous material can be studied in small test pieces, whereas in order to study a composite structure or material, it ir necessary to have a relativcly large cross section in ordcr to represent the entire material, which can then be considered as homogeneous. In order to analyze the data and apply them to actual situations, it is also necessary to know the constituent equation under conditions of combined forces or with a stepped load diagram. Test apparatuses exist for the first case seeItalian Patent Specification No. 985 074 dated 16th May 1973 , but for the second case there are no known apparatuses which are adequate to perform tests requiring heavy loads, rapid application of the load, and a long duration of loading under conditions where the force of the load is closely controlled.The apparatus described in the afore mentioncd patent is not suitable for direct application to heavy loads since the device for release of the load comprises a fragile intermediate member vhich has prohibitive 8jmensions. Purthermore, since the loads in question are large, special precautions are necessary with regard to the satiety of the installation during testing, e.g. in the case of the hydraulic jack for tensioning the cable and the braking means for preventing the cable fro being compressed. To obviate the afore mentioned limitations, the present invention provides a novel apparatus for studyin the behaviour of materials with continually increasing stages of stress, and for investigating the strain hardening of materials due to successive plastic deformation thereof, with particular regard to the dynamics of large structures under heavy, rapidly changing loads According to the main feature of the invention the proposed apparatus comprises, for each stress axis to be tested, a loading cable for applying a force to the test piece, either in tension or in compression, a hydraulic jack for tensioning the cable, a structure for securing the cable, optionally at discrete intervals along ito length, a stopping and releasing device for securing the cable before the test and for propagating a load wave to the test piece after the release mechanism has been actuated, a recoil shock absorber, and at least one device for limiting lateral oscillations of the cable. According to another feature of the invention, the cable securing structure is tubular structure which operates under compression. According to another feature of the invention, the device for stopping and releasing the cable under tens comprises explosive bolts with electric detonators synchronized to a microsecond. One embodiment of an apparatus according to te present specification is illustrated in the acconipanying drawin s, in which Figure 1 is a general view of a biaxial embodiment e the apparatus and Figure 2 is a sectional, side view taken along the line AA of Figure 1. Figure 1 shows a steel cable 1, acting as an energy accumulator, secured at one end 2 by a hydraulic jack 3 to a stationary reinforced concrete holder 4. The other end 5 is mechanically connected to a test piece 6 which, in the biaxial embodiment, is connected to another cable 7 at right angles to cable 1 and is secured by retaining means 8, 9 to a bunker 10. In the case of triaxia8 tests, there will be three cables and three refraining means for securing to the bunker. In another embodiment of the machine, a double cable is provided for each direction of force and holds the test piece 6 at either end cruciform embodiment . In the biaxial embodiment, cable 1 is held horizontal and secured by appropriate intermediate means 11, 12 disposed along its entire length e.g. 100 m at discrete intervals. A release mechanism 13 is disposed at the bunker end of the cable and comprises two electrically synchronized explosive bolts 14, 15 and a recoil shock absorber 16 made up of springs in series and in parallel. Figure 2 is a sectional, side view of the apparatus ofFigure 1 taken along the line AA of Figure 1. Like elements bear like numbers. The loading cable 1 is relatively long, to provide a long duration tension pulse. h suitable device for applying a load to the test piece is used for tensile and compression testing. The cable is dimensioned so that it can easily reach a permissible load of several hundred tonnes, by taking advantage of the fact that the cable is made up of relatively thin wires which can bear.high permitted loads. The hydraulic jack 3 is required for tensioning the cable. The structure 4 bearing the axial force can comprise tubular structure operating under compression, or two stationary securing means at the ends. The stopping and release device 13, which holds the end of the cable before the test, can propagate a load wave to the test piece secured at the end of the cable, after some securing means 14,15 has broken. Release is obtained by exploding electric detonators placed in a recess inside each component e.g. each explosive bolt of the release mechanism, the components being electrically synchronized to within microseconds. Owing to the large amount of energy that is involved, there may be danger to people or property if the cable is released completely, followed by a whiplash when the cable changes from a state of tension to a state of compression in such cases the cable, which has just operated with a load at its end, bends rapidly sideways . The recoil shock absorber 16, made up of sets of springs in series or in parallel, prevents the cable from changing over to te state Of compression, and thus damps down the stresses which are continuously reflected after impact against the shock absorber. Additional protection against a whiplash is provided by the securing structures 11, 12 which limit the lateral motion of the cable. The stress axes can be parallel shear forces or variously inclined or at right angles or in different planes which may or may not be at right angles, so that a variety of stresses can be applied to the cross section under test. An alternative load device can comprises explosive charges synchronized with the action of the cable. The protective bunker, which is the main stationary part of the machine structure, is an element common to all axes. The intermediate means for securing the cable all the way along its length can be used for applying successive degrees of force when stressing the cross section under test, the duration of the force being proportional to the length of the cable portions which are progressively released from the securing means. The device can be used to study the behaviour of materials under continuously increasing states of stress, or more particularly for investigating strain hardening due to successive plastic deformation, or for studying relaxation phenomena.
