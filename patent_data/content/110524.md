# Malfunction detector for electrostatic spraying apparatus.

## Abstract
A spray malfunction detector system for electrostatic spraying apparatus having a sprayhead connectable to a high voltage source and being adapted to direct a spray of charged particles of fluid towards an earthed target the said system comprising an earth circuit form the earthed target, a by pass electrode located in the vicinity of the sprayhead and maintainable in use at such a potential as to attract co rona discharge from the sprayhead and a current detector located in the earth circuit between the earthed target and any junction in the earth circuit via which corona discharge joins the earth circuit from the by pass electrode.
