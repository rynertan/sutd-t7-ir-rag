# Optical focus position control in an optical memory system.

## Abstract
An optical focus position control system in an optomagnetic disc apparatus includes a tracking control device and a focus control device. The tracking control device includes an intermediate holder, a tracking parallel spring which connects an objective lens mirror cylinder to the inter mediate holder while ensuring movement of the objective lens mirror cylinder in the radial direction of the optomagne tic disc, and a tracking drive mechanism to shift the objective lens mirror cylinder in the radial direction within the inter mediate holder. The focus control device includes a stationary holder, a focusing parallel spring which connects the inter mediate holder to the stationary holder while ensuring movement of the intermediate holder in the direction of the optical axis of laser beams emitted through the optical focus position control system, and a focusing drive mechanism to shift the intermediate holder in the optical axis direction within the stationary holder.
