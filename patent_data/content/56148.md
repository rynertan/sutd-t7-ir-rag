## Description
Respirator The invention relates to a respirator according to the general portion of Claim 1. An apparatus for controlled metering and mixing of two or more gases comprising those features is known from GB A 20 26 728, and it is mentioned in the specification thereof that the apparatus may be used for artificial respiration. It is the main object of the invention to provide a respirator in which the gas flow is very simply controlled and the number of variables to be measured and controlled is comparatively small. For a respirator it is further essential that it works failsafe. These objects are achieved by the invention as described in Claim 1. Choosing the inlet pressure and the cross section of the gas passage in such a way that at any time when the valve is open the flow streams under critical conditions allows to measure only the inlet pressure and therewith facilitates control of the valves.Providing at least two valves connected in parallel and providing a phase shift between the opening intervals of the two valves leads to an improved uniformity of the gas flow and simultaneously improves the reliability of the respirator as far as should one of the valves fail, gas will still be supplied to the patient via the other valves. A critical passage is to be understood to mean herein a constriction in a duct whose cross section is such that the gas velocity in the constriction equals the velocity of sound. It will be apparent that the gas velocity will depend on the pressure in the gas supply duct and on the cross section Of the constriction, and that the velocity of sound will depend on the properties of the gas and on the temperature. The invention leads to a reliable respirator which canbe finely adjusted and which has a large control range between minimum and maximum supply of more that 1 100. Further improvements and modifications of the invention are described in the Sub claims.The invention will be described in detail hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawing. Therein Figure 1 is a longitudinal sectional view of a tube including a constriction. Figure 2 is a graph illustrating the operation of the tube shown in Figure 1, Figure 3 shows the flow characteristics of a number of critical passages, Figure 4 shows a diagram of a control member for controlling a gas flow, including a critical passage, and Figure 5 shows a diagram of an embodiment of a respirator in accordance with the invention. Some theoretical aspects of a gas flow through a tube including a constriction will first be described with reference to Figure 1. A tube 1 which is shown in longitudinal section in Figure 1, includes a constriction 3. Gas flows through the tube 1 in the direction of the arrow 5o Three stream lines 7 are shown in the figure. In accordance with Euler s equation, the following is valid for a steady flow along a stream line in aEMI2.1 p is the pressure of the gas s is the directional vector of the stream line y is the vertical coordinate level g the acceleration of the force of gravity v is the velocity of the gas. If it is assumed that the gas does not exchange energy with its environment isentropic process , furthermore EMI3.1 C specific heat at constant pressure p C specific heat at constant volume. If it is also assumed that energy variatiag due to a change in level, is negligibly small and that the cross section FB in the constriction 3 at B in Figure 1 is much smaller than the cross section FA upstream from the constriction at A , so that vA 44 vg, it follows fromEMI3.2 It follows from 2 that EMI3.3 Therein,EMI3.4 and 0 x 1. If it is also assumed that the gas is an ideal gas, which holds good to a close aaproximation for those gases such as air, oxygen and laughing gas most often used in a respirator, the following is applicable P p RT 6 Therein, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature of the gas.EMI3.5 given temperature and is approximately constant as the ambient temperature varies, because T is the absolute temperature and occurs after the radical sign. In practice, this term changes approximately 1.7 0 00 per C change in ambient temperature. The functionEMI4.1 is graphically represented in Figure 2 for 0 x 1 and K 1.40. This value of K is applicable to air.EMI4.2 The pressure P at C is. approximately equal to 9 the ambient pressure. When PA Pc, gas starts to flow then, in accordance with 7 EMI4.3 This formula is correct if PA Pm. If PA PmS it holds good for Pm Pc 1 bar that the critical value of p, p and v are equal to EMI4.4 When the pressure PA is increased further, f x does not decrease but remains constant at the maximum value.In the narrowest cross section 3, the gas velocity then remains equal to the velocity of sound. This is because a higher value is impossible. A constriction of this kind is referred to as a critical passage. The mass flow in the narrowest cross section 3 is determined by the density of the gas P B and is proportional to the pressure In Figure 3, the volume flow t measured for a number of critical passages is shown as a function of the pressure PA. The diameter of the constriction DB is stated in millimeters for each curve. This figure clearly shows.that beyond a shaded pressure zone 9 the volume flow varies linearly with the supply pressure PA. . Assuming that the temperature of the outflowing gas ultimately reaches a constant value of 293 K and the pressure a constant value of 1 bar, this linear relationship also applies to the mass flow, of course. It will be apparent from the foregoing that for a critical passage a linear relationship exists between the pressure of the gas supplied and the mass flow through the critical passage. This relationship is determined completely by measurable physical variables, such as the area and the geometry of the narrowest cross section and the properties of the gas. Figure 4 shows a diagram of a control member for controlling a gas flo in a gas duct which extends from a gas supply duct 11 to a patient duct 13. The control member comprises a gas flow controller 15 and a control element 17. The gas flow controller 15 comprises two parallel connected valves 19, each of which is connected in series with a critical passage 91. The critical passages 21 may be formed, for example, by intermediate duct portions including a constriction as shown in Figure 1, or by the narrow exit openings of the valves 19. The diameter in the region of the constriction preferably amounts to approximately 1.5 mm. The valves 19 are opened and closed by control signals which are applied by the control element 17 via control leads 23. When a valve is open, the gas flow through the valve is linearly dependent on the pressure in the supply duct 11, as has already been demonstrated. This pressure is measured by means of a pressure garage25 and is applied, via a measuring connection 27, to the control element 17. The desired gas flow can be adjusted, for example, by means of an adjusting knob not shown provided on the control element 17. The control element then varies the relative amount of time during which the valves 19 are open in dependence on the pressure in the gas supply duct 11 and the adjusted, desired gas flow. In principle, one valve 19 with the associated critical passage 21 would suffice for this control system, but the parallel connect ion of a plurality of valves offers the advantage that the control range may be larger and the conducted gas flow is more uniform I pulsatory .The later call be achieved by controlling the valves with a mutual difference in phase in the embodiment shown in Figure 4, this is realized, for example, so that bhe period during which one valve is open is situated in the middle of the period during which the other valve is closed. For the purposes of lllustrazion, Figure 4 shows examples of control signals 29 and 31 for the two valves 19. The relevant valve is open during each positive pulse. The repetition frequency of the two pulse series is, for example, 15 Hz. A further step for sus essing irregularities in the gas flow is the introduction of a buffer between the critical passage 21 and the patient duct 13, for example, a buffer in the form of an acoustic filter 33 which also serves to suppress disturbing noise. Figure 5 shows a diagram of a respirator utilizing control members of the kind described with reference toFigure 4. For the sake of simplicity, Figure 5 shows only those parts through which the gases pass, the control elements 17 and other known electrical components having been omitted. The respirator shown in Figure 5 comprises a housing 35 in which there ara accommodated two gas flow controllers 15 which in principle correspond to the gas flow controller shown in Figure 4, but each of which comprises four parallel connected valves 19 instead of two, so that the controllability and uniformity of the gas flow are even further improved. One of the gas flow controllers 15 the upper controller in Figure 5 is connected to an oxygen duct 39 via a gas coupling 37, Between the oxygen duct 39 and the gas coupling 37 there are provided a reducing valve 41 and a buffer 43. The reducing valve 41 ensures that the oxygen is applied to the gas flow controller at an adjustable pressure for example, 3 6 bar and the buffer 43 smooths out any pulses in the gas flow produced by the gas flow controller, so that these pulses do not have a disturbing effect on the reducing valve. A laughing gas duct 5 and an air duct 47 are similarly connected to gas couplings 37 via reducing valves 41 and buffers 43. The latter gas couplings are connected to the second gas flow controller 15 via a change over valve 49. The change over valve 49 is controlled so that air or laughing gas is applied to the second gas flow controller 15, as desired. The first gas flow controller 15 thus controls the oxygen flow and the second gas flow controller controls the flow of air or 20 The ratio between on the one hand the amount of oxygen and on the other hand the amount of air or N20 can be controlled by suitable control of the two gas flow controllers 15. The gas flow emerging from the gas flow controllers 15 is passed through an acoustic filter 33 which comprises guide partitions 51 which force the gas flow denoted by arrows through fibrous material 53. The gas flows from the two gas flow controllers 15 are also thoroughly mixed in this filter. Via a gas coupling 55, the outlet of the filter 33 is connected to a nozzle 57 which may include a pressure detector 59 and a gas flow detector 61. Via this nozzle, the gas flow is administered to a patient 63. The outlet of the filter 33 is connected to a safety valve 65 which is automatically opened when the patient pressure rises above a preset value, for example, from 0.025 to 0.12 bar above atmospheric pressure . For exhalation there is provided an exhalation valve 67 which can be dIsposed of after use. This exhabation valve is pneumatically controlled by means of air from the air duct 47 which is supplied via a reducing valve 69 and a valve 71.
