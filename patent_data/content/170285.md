# Semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
The semiconductor memory device contains a plurality of memory cells M11, M21, ... , a row decoder 12 for selectively actuating memory cells M11, M21, ... according to the selected one of the row and column address signals, and bit lines BA11, BB11 BA21, BB21,... set to a potential dependent on the data in the memory cell actuated. Particu larly, this memory device has latching circuits L11, ... for latching the potentials on the bit lines BA11, BB11 BA21, BB21, ... , and a timing controller for causing the latching circuits L11, ... to keep the latched potentials for a predetermined period after the update of the row address signal.
