## Description
PREPARATION OF 1 ALKYL 3,5 DIPHENYLPYRAZOLES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a novel method for preparing substituted and unsubstituted l alkyl 3,5 diphenylpyrazole compounds by reacting a 3,5 diphenyl substituted or unsubstituted pyrazole with an excess of dialkyl sulfate, in the presence of aqueous alkali hydroxide. This reaction also contains a quaternary ammonium phase transfer catalyst and is carried out at temperatures of about 200C to 750 for about 1 to 2 hours. Other methods have been developed for the preparation of such substituted and unsubstituted l alkyl 3,5diphenylpyrazole compounds, but these methods utilize solid inorganic alkali metal strong bases, U.S. patent 3,907,824, Garber, September 23, 1975. Furthermore, these solid inorganic alkali metal base methods require anhydrous reaction conditions for several reasons.First, these anhydrous conditions ensure optimum reaction and ensure adequate storage conditions for the strong bases. Secondly, these anhydrous conditions are better suited for the careful control of the very exothermic resulting reaction. Attempts have been made to prepare the l alkyl3,5 diphenylpyrazoles of the present invention using aqueous bases without utilizing quaternary ammonium phase transfer catalysts See Example 10 in Table II , but these attempts have resulted in an incomplete N monomethylation reaction, with the remainder of substantial quantities of unreacted 3,5 diphenyipyrazoles. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention, therefore, relates to a novel method for preparing substituted and unsubstituted 1alkyl 3,5 diphenylpyrazole compounds having structural formula I ,EMI3.1 wherein R1 is C1 to C4 alkyl and Y, yl, Z and Z1 each represents hydrogen, nitro, halogen, C1 to C4 alkyl, C1 toC4 haloalkyl and C1 to C4 alkoxy. These formula I compounds are prepared by reacting a 3,5 diphenyl substituted or unsubstituted pyrazole, dissolved in an inert organic solvent, with an excess, about 1.0 to 1.5 moles, of an alkylating agent such as dialkylsulfate, in the present of about 1.0 to 2.5 moles preferably about 1.15 to 2.10 moles of a 40 to 60 preferably 50 aqueous inorganic alkali metal base such as an alkali hydroxide and about 1.0 to 10.0 of a quaternary ammonium phase transfer catalyst.This reaction is carried out at temperatures of about 200C to 750C for a time period of about one 1 to two 2 hours. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a novel method for preparing said formula I compounds utilizing an aqueous base in the presence of a quaternary ammonium phase transfer catalyst, thereby avoiding the drawbacks of the prior art solid baseanhydrous systems. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method for preparing formula I compounds that result in enhanced N mono methylation reactions without leaving substantial quantities of unreacted 3,5 diphenylpyrazoles. These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent by the more detailed description that follows. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In addition to the formula I compounds disclosed above, the process of the present invention for formulating such compounds includes other reactive components. Solvents which can be used in the preparation of the l alkyl 3 , 5 diphenylpyrazoles include non aqueous, inert organic solvents. Preferably, these solvents are selected from aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons of C6 to C10 and halocarbons. Preferred aromatic hydrocarbons include benzene. toluene, xylene or mixtures thereof. Preferred aliphatic hydrocarbons suitable for the solvents of the present invention include hexane and heptane, and some useful halocarbons are ethylenedichloride, methylene chloride and mono or dichlorobenzene. Suitable aqueous inorganic alkali metal bases include sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. The present method also includes quaternary ammonium phase transfer catalysts, represented by structural formula II EMI4.1 wherein R1, R2, R3 are C1 to C18 alkyl, C1 to Clg alkenyl,C1 to C18 haloalkyl, benzyl, ethylhydroxyl, and X is bromine, chlorine methyl sulfate or bisulfate or a dialkylpyrazolium compound wherein X is as previously defined. The reaction of the present invention may be illustrated by the following flow diagram EMI5.1 Catalytic Quaternary 50 MOHAmmonium Phase R1O 02 Transfer CatalystEMI5.2 wherein R1, Y, yl, Z, zl and the quaternary ammonium phase transfer catalyst are as previously described. The present invention is of particular importance in the manufacture of l methyl 3,5 diphenylpyrazole and the conversion thereof to 1,2 dimethyl 3,5 diphenylpyrazolium methyl sulfate. The latter compound is a highly effective herbicidal agent. Moreover, said compound is especially useful for the selective control of wild oats in the presence of a wide variety of small grains, such as barley, rape, wheat and rye.The process of the present invention results in the preparation of good over 95 yields of 1methyl 3,5 diphenylpyrazole from 3,5 diphenylpyrazole and good purities greater than 96 . The methylation reaction is complete within about one to two hours with very little dimethylation occurring.After washing with aqueous base and water, the solvent, preferably xylene, containing essentially pure l methyl3,5 diphenylpyrazole is concentrated to about 25 of its orginal volume. This concentrated solution is then directly used for the preparation of the 1,2 dimethyl 3,5diphenylpyrazolium methyl sulfate salt. The l methyl 3,5 diphenylpyrazole xylene solution obtained from the above described reaction is mixed with ethylene dichloride in amounts approximately equivalent to the amount of xylene remaining in the concentrated pyrazole xylene solution. The mixture is then heated to a temperature of about 500C to 550C. An equimolar amounts preferably a slight excess, about 1.0 to 1.5 moles, of the dialkyl sulfate such as dimethyl sulfate is added thereofThis mixture is stirred and heated to temperatures of about 900C to 1100C for about four hours. The reaction mixture is cooled to 500C and anhydrous triethylamine, equivalent to the excess of dialkyl sulfate used, is added. This resulting mixture is stirred at 500C for 30 minutes and then cooled to about 150C, with the crystallized product being separated from the solvent. Any convenient means of separation may be employed, such as centrifugation, filtration, decantation or the like. The product cake is washed with an aromatic solvent, such as xylene washed again with a lower ketone, such as acetone and finally dried. Alternatively, the product cake may be dissolved in water, with the thus prepared aqueous solution being directly used for the control of undesirable plant species. In further characterizing th is method, about 10 to 259 molar excess of dialkyl sulfate is added to the stirred mixture of 3,5 diphenylpyrazole substituted or unsubstituted dissolved in an inert organic solvent, such as xylene. Furthermore, about 15 to 105 molar excess of the 40coo to 60Xs aqueous alkali hydroxide with quaternary ammonium phase transfer catalyst is used and at temperatures of about 230C to 500C. The present invention is further illustrated by the following non limiting examples.
