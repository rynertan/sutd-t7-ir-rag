# PRODUCTION OF MAGNETIC RECORDING MEDIUM WITH VERTICALLY ORIENTED ACICULAR PARTICLES

## Abstract
A process produces a magnetic recording composition having vertically aligned acicular magnetic particles therein. The particles are dispersed in a curable binder system which is subjected to radiant energy while the particles are vertically aligned by an applied magnetic field to rapidly cure the coating and effectively freeze the particles in their vertically aligned orientation. A liquid, curable binder system 12 containing acicular magnetic particles 13 is applied to a substrate 11 . The magnetic particles are subjected to a magnetic field by an electromagnet 16 to align the particles vertically. Radiant energy 17 is applied to the surface of the binder system containing the vertically aligned particles to gel the binder system sufficiently to maintain the particles vertical. The method is particularly applicable to a magnetic recording disk to provide perpendicular anisotropy.
