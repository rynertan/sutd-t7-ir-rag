## Description
The present invention relates to washers used for washing and aspirating the wash solution from a solid body member. Certain types of immunologic diagnostic assays require the use of solid supports hereinafter beads upon which certain chemical and or bio chemical reactions take place. Beads can be fashioned out of glass, metal or plastics. Certain immunologic diagnostic assays primarily are directed to measuring the quantity of material that has reacted with the sample being tested. It is frequently necessary while conducting such assays to completely wash and aspirate the wash solution from beads, which are located in reaction vessels such as test tubes, in order to remove as completely as possible the excess material which has not reacted with the sample under analysis. The effectiveness of such washing can impact directly the accuracy and precision of such assays. In order to achieve a thorough washing of the bead, it is necessary to wash the entire surface of the bead. Known bead washing systems aspirate excess washing fluid through an aperture at the center of the bottom portion of the probe. Thus, the bead is drawn into stable contact with the center of the bottom portion of the probe and at least some portion of the bead will be in relatively stable contact with the probe. Although these systems are fit for their intended purposes, a stable contact point with the bottom of the probe tends to hinder the washing effect at that point and in the area immediately surrounding it. It is desirable to provide an improved system for more completely washing beads used as solid supports in immunologic diagnostic assays. The present invention provides an apparatus for washing beads that avoids the above noted and other disadvantages of known bead washing methods and devices. The present device holds the bead in unstable equilib rium at the bottom of the probe so that the bead may roll and spin around on the bottom surface of the probe exposing all of its surface to washing fluid. In accordance with the invention, a probe com prising two passages may be lowered into a reaction vessel housing a bead. The first of said passages may be operatively connected to a washing fluid source and the second of said passages may be operatively connected to a low pressure air source. Washing fluid may be delivered to the bead through the first of said passages. A bearing surface about the center line of the second of said passages including a plurality of ports extending through said bearing surface allows the bead to be drawn up to the bearing surface whereby it may freely move in unstable contact with the bearing surface while being agitated by the action of the wash solution being introduced into the vicinity of the probe by the first of said passages and the aspiration of the wash solution through said ports. The unstable equilibrium achieved by the bead effects more efficient washing of the bead. Accordingly, the present invention provides a novel apparatus for washing beads used as solid supports in immunologic diagnostic assays. In particular, there is provided an apparatus for washing and aspirating the washing fluid from an object within a receptacle, comprising a body operatively connected to both a low pressure air source and a washing fluid source a probe attached to said body and operatively connected to both said low pressure air source and said washing fluid source said probe introducible into said receptacle the lower end portion of said probe including a tip surface adjacent said object having a substan tially concave surface with a bearing surface normal to the centerline of the probe, said bearing surface having a plurality of ports therethrough means adjacent said end portion for introduc ing washing fluid into the receptacle and means con tiguous with said tip surface for aspirating said washing fluid from said receptacle through said plurality of ports. Other details and advantages will be discussed in detail below. The present diagnostic assay bead washer is a lightweight hand held apparatus designed to allow for washing simultaneously a plurality of beads used as solid supports for immunologic diagnostic assays, each bead located in an individual receptacle. The body of the bead washer may be fashioned from injection molded synthetic thermoplastics. Turning in detail to the drawings, Figure 1 illustrates a hand held diagnostic bead washer head and probe assembly 10 hereinafter the bead washer . As can be seen from the figures, a single bead 82 illus trated in Figure 8 per receptacle can be washed when probe assembly 53 is lowered into the receptacle and rocker switch 18 is pivoted into its second switching position. This action forces plunger 42 and pad 44 downward compressing bellows 28 between pad 44 and sur face 46 to effect an increase in pressure in control line 32 which is connected to the bead washer head at connector 50. Control line 32 is attached to a pressure switch not shown which, when a higher than normal pressure is available along control line 32, causes a pump not shown to cycle forcing a measured amount of washing fluid from a washing fluid source through wash ing fluid supply line 34. Washing fluid enters the bead washer head through connector 52. A low pressure air supply is connected to the bead washer head via low pressure air line 30 at connector 48. The low pressure air supply is distributed to the various probe assem blies with manifold 22. Washing fluid is distributed to the various probe assemblies with manifold 26. The removable probe assemblies 53 fit into the bead washer head at probe attachment points 24 with the inner probe assembly 60 which carries the low pressure air supply extending into the manifold 22 and sealed thereto with O ring 54. Outer probe assembly 56 carries the washing fluid between its inner wall and the outer wall of inner probe assembly 60. The passage 61 thereby defined is sealed to the manifold 26 with O ring 58. Proper spac ing and registration between the inner and outer probe assemblies is aided by raised portions 62 of the inner probe assembly. The top cover to the body 16 is attached to the body assembly 22, 26 with screws 14 and cover plate 12 covers the screws and may be used to note information. Springs 38 and 36 act to bias rocker switch 18 to its neutral first position. Fins 64 may be used at the end of the probe assemblies to deflect washing fluid for improved washing action. Turning in detail to Figure 2, probe plug 74 may be utilized to seal an unused probe attachment point 24 so that the bead washer may be used with less than all of its probes. To utilize the option, probe assem bly 53 is detached from the bead washer head and probe plug 74 is attached in its place. The probe plug con sists of a piece of plastic or similar material closed at the top. The low pressure air supply manifold region 68 is sealed by O ring 76 and the washing fluid supply manifold region 70 is sealed by O ring 78. To replace the probe assembly, the probe plug is removed and a probe assembly inserted at the available probe attach ment point. Turning now in detail to Figures 5, 7 and 8, agitation of the bead 82 is depicted in Figure 8. The bead is free to move around on bearing surface 84. A raised portion 80 to the bearing surface may be provided to aid agitation and fluid flow through the ports. In an actual embodiment of the invention, the raised por tion 80 was fabricated with dimensions that prohibited the bead from actually making contact with the unraised portion of the bearing surface and provided a clearance of approximately .020 .030 inches therefrom. In this case, bead contact is confined to raised portion 80 at the center of the bearing surface and substantially concave surface 99. Fluid flowing around the bead and back through aspiration ports 86 causes additional bead agitation thereby insuring that the bead does not rest on any single point during the entire bead washing procedure. Fluid is drawn away from the bead through aspiration ports 86 and up low pressure air tube 88 at the core of the inner probe assembly. When the bead washing procedure is completed, and the measured amount of washing fluid has washed the bead and been aspirated completely from the receptacle, the operator moves the rocker switch 18 to the third switching position depressing plunger 40 and blocking the low pressure air supply at hole 41 and causing the low pressure air supply to vent through elongated open ing 72 shown in Figure 3 . This action shuts off the low pressure air flow to the manifold 68 without tending to cause the low pressure air line 30 to collapse. Improved agitation may be achieved by placing a port connecting the tip surface directly with the passage 61. Thus, an apparatus for washing beads is dis closed which is useful for washing beads located in receptacles. While embodiments and applications of this invention have been shown and described, it would be apparent to those skilled in the art that many more modifications are possible without departing from the spirit of the invention.
