# POSITION ERROR CORRECTING DEVICE.

## Abstract
A position error correcting device which can precisely correct the backlash and the pitch error of a mechanical system even if variations occur in states such as, for example, the temperature of a numerically controlled machine tool. An error correction data group previously obtained by measurements of the states of the machine tool is stored in an error memory circuit MEM correspondingly to the respective states. An error correcting data selection circuit MPX selects an error correction data group corresponding to the state of the machine tool from the error correction data group stored in the memory circuit MEM . A position correcting circuit CPG adds a correction pulse to the command pulse of a feedback pulse from the position detector using the error correction data group selected by the selecting circuit MPX to correct the position.
