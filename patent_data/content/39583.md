# Reverse osmosis tubular membrane module.

## Abstract
A reverse osmosis tubular membrane module has a plurality of tubular membrane tubes 50 arranged in a set of parallel supporting tubes 12 with an axial annular permeate flow channel 64 defined between each membrane tube and the supporting tubes 12 within which it is contained and containing an open neck resilient material 54 . Supports 18 are provided at each end of the supporting tubes to receive the opposite ends of the membrane tubes and have permeate collection passageways 24 therein connected at 46 to receive permeate from the annular channels 64 . U shaped connecting tubes 26 connect the adjacent ends of pairs of membrane tubes to provide a continuous flow path with the interior of the membrane tubes of the module. Means are provided for forcing the U shaped connecting tubes 26 at each end of the module into a resilient grommet 56 to provide a sealing relationship with the interior of the membrane tubes 50 .
