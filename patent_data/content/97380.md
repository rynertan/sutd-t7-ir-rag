# A SYSTEM FOR POSITIONING A UTILIZATION DEVICE

## Abstract
A system for positioning a utilization device 33, 105 , which forms part of an optical imaging system, parallel to a selected plane X Y , comprises a base structure 101 , a plurality of spaced drive means 237 255 for supporting the utilization device 33, 105 for translational movement along a first axis Z normal to a plane X Y of the base structure 101 and for rotational movement about second and third axes X, Y orthogonal to the first axis Z and parallel to said plane X Y of the base structure 101 and constraining means 283, 297, 299 , including the drive means 237 255 , for kinematically constraining the utilization device 33, 105 to move only along the first axis Z and about the second and third axes X, Y . The system may be applied for instance to position the small plane of a projection lens of said optical imaging system to achieve precise focusing of the surface of a simiconductive wafer.
