The ketcnes of the formulae TI and vi can for example be synthetized by the Friedel Crafts type ketone synthesis G.A. Olah Friedel Crafts and related reactions, IlI l, Ed. IntersciencePublishers 1964, pp. 1 63 . The compounds of the formulae III and VII are for example prepared from the corresponding aryl halides by known techniques N.3. Kharash et al. Grignard reactions of nonmetallic substances,Ed. Prentice Hall. Inc. 1954 pp. 5 90 , while the alkali metal organic compounds can be prepared following the method disclosed in Houben Weyl Methoden der organischen Chemie, XIII 1, pp. 134 159 and 389 405 1970 . The compounds of the formula VI can for example be synthetized from the corresponding propiophenones by reaction with the corresponding Grignard reactants see e.g. N.S. Kharash et al. Grignard reactions of nonmetallic substances,Ed. Prentice Hall Inc. 1954 pp. 134 143 . The compounds of the formula I provided by the invention are pharmacologically active.In particular, they inhibit the microsomal monooxygenase enzyme system of liver, and can therefore be used in therapy to inhibit or reduce the toxic effect of exogenic xenobiotic substances, which are transformed into toxic, active metabolites in the liver 1 .N. Jerina et al. Science, 185, 573 1974 , resulting in liver necrosis, blood discrasia, carcinosis. In pharmaceutical combinations the compounds according to the invention may increase the duration of the effect of other active ingredients. The enzyme inhibiting activity of the new compounds was tested in vivo, by measuring the change of hexobarbital oxidase activity. Female Rann. Wistar rats, each weighing 50 to 60 g. were treated orally with a single 40 mg. kg. dose of the test compound. 1 and 24 hours after the administration of the active ingredient, the animals were narcotized with a 60 mg. kg. i.v. dosage of hexobarbital sodium, and the time elapsed until complete wakening was measured Noordhoek, J. Eur. J. Pharmacol., 3, 242 1968 . The data were recorded, and the mean values, the standard errors, as well as the percentage increase with respect to the controls were calculated for each group. As a reference compound Proadifen 2 diethylaminoethyl alpha , alpha diphenyl valerate, i.e.the most effective known compound, was employed, in a dose of 100 mg. kg. The hexobarbital concentration of the plasm, measured on the instant wakening, was the same for both the treated and the control animals, and thus the increase of narcosis period was not due to a certain central nervous interaction Jori, A. et al. Biochem. Tharmacol., 19, 2687 1970 . The results are shown in Table 1.

The effect of the new compounds provided by the invention is better than that ofProadiphene also from qualitative aspects, since, in conctrast to Proadiphene, the initial inhibiting effect caused by the compounds according to the invention is not followed by an increase, i.e.induction of the activity of the microsomal enzyme system. The enzyme inhibiting activity of the compounds of the formula I was further tested by determining the activity of the polysubstrate monooxigenase enzyme system of the liver after treatment with placebo and the compounds according to the invention, respectively. Female R.Wistar rats weighing 50 to 60 g. each were administered a single 40 mg. kg. dose of the test compounds, orally. Two hours after treatment the animals were decapitated and the livers were eliminated.After rinsing with a physiological saline solution at OOC, drying and weighing, the livers were homogenized in a 0.1 molar Tris HCl buffer pH 7.4 , containing 1.15 of potassium chloride at dC, centrifuged at 9000 g for 20 minutes, and the supernatant postmitochondrial fraction was used for further investigations. The microsoma fraction was prepared following the method developed byCinti D.1. et al. Biochem. Tharmacol., 21, 5249 1972 . The activity of aniline hydroxylase was determined from the velocity of pamino phenol formation according to Chabra R.S. et al. Toxicol. 1Appl. Tharmacol., 22, 50 1972 . The activity of the aminopyrine demethylase was measured from the amount of the formaldehyde formed, according to Gourlay G.K. et al. Biochem. Pharmacol., 27, 965 1973 . The control groups were treated with placebo. The results are shown in Table 2, in of the control.

The compounds of the formula I when tested by the above methods proved completely ineffective, whereas Proadiphene exerted an anticonvulsive side effect H. Ippen Index Pharmacorum 1970 , 40S 3.1 . The acute toxicity of the compounds of the formula I was tested on H Wistar rats of both sexes, weighing 160 to 180 g. each. The compounds were administered in a single 500 rng. kg. dose, orally.The animals were observed for 14 days. The results are set forth in Table 3. Table 3Compound Perished animals. n 500 mg. kg. p.o. A 0 10 B 0 10Proadiphene 90 10 As appears from the data of Table 3, the toxicity of the instant compounds is considerably lower than that of Proadiphene, accordingly their therapeutic index is much more favourable. The pharmacologically active compounds according to the invention can be used in therapy in the form of pharmaceutical compositions, which are formulated as preparations suitable for oral, rectal and or parenteral administration. For oral administration tablets, drawees or capsules are prepared. The oral formulations contain as a vehicle e.g. lactose or starch, as an excipient or a granulation aid e.g. gelatine, carboxymethyl cellulose sodium, methyl cellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone or starch gum, as a disintegrating substance e.g. potato starch or microcrystalline cellulose, ultraamylopectine or formaldehyde casein, etc. The formulations may also contain adhesives and lubricants such as talc, colloidal silica, stearine, calcium or magnesium stearate, etc. Tablets are prepared for example by wet granulation and subsequent pressing. A mixture of the active ingredient and the vehicle and optionally a part of the disintegrating agent are granulated with an aqueous, alcoholic or aqueousralcoholic solution of the excipients in a suitable equipment, and the granulate is dried. The remaining portion of the disintegrating substance, lubricant, antiadhesive or optional further additives is then added to the granules, and the mixture is pressed to tablets. If desired, the tablets are prepared with a dividing line, which facilitates administration. Tablets can be prepared also from a mixture of the active ingredient and suitable additives by direct pressing. If desired, the tablets can be converted into ragÃ©es, using protecting, flavouring agents and pigments generally known for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions, e.g. sugar, cellulose derivatives methyl or ethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose sodium, etc. , polyvinylpyrrolidone, calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, food pigments, food oil varnishes, aroma substances, iron oxide pigments, etc. Capsules are prepared by filling a mixture of the active ingredients and additives into suitable capsules. For rectal administration the compositions are formulated as suppositories, which contain in addition to the active ingredient a carrier mass, called adeps pro suppository. Suitable carriers include vegetable fats, e.g. hardened vegetable oils, triglycerides of fatty acids having 12 to 18 carbon atoms, preferably Witepsol a registered trade mark . The active ingredient is homogenously distributed in the melted carrier mass, and suppositories are prepared by casting. For parenteral administration injectable preparations are prepared. To prepare an injectable solution the active ingredient is dissolved in distilled water and or various organic solvents, e.g. glycol ethers, optionally in the presence of dissolution aids, e.g. polyoxyethylene sorbitane monolaurate, monooleate or monostearate Tween 20,Tween 60, Tween 80 .The injectable solutions may contain also various additives, e.g. preserving agents, such as benzyl alcohol, o oxy benzoic acid retnyl or propyl ester, benalkonium chloride cr phenyl mercuri borate, etc., antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, tocopherol, sodium pyrosulfate and optionally complexing agents to bind metal traces such as ethylene diamine tetraacetate, buffers to adjust the pH and optionally local anaesthetics such as lidocaine. The injectable solutions are filtered, filled in to ampoules and sterilized. The daily dose, depending on the state of the patient, varies between 1.0 and 200.0 mg. kg., preferably 2.0 and 40.0 mg. kg, riich is preferably administered in more smaller dose units.
