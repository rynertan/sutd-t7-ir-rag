# Temperature measuring apparatus.

## Abstract
An infrared sensor 4 made of LiTaOâ‚ƒ is provided on a ceiling of a heating chamber of a microwave oven, and a chopper 5 is provided so as to intermittently block infrared radiation emitted from food 2 in the heating chamber 1 . The infrared sensor 4 is brought to face the food 2 and the chopper 5 alternately and provides a corresponding AC output signal. The temperature of the chopper 5 is detected from the output signal of a separately provided chopper temperature sensor 8 consisting of a thermistor. The detected chopper temperature output signal is correct ed in a microcomputer to be substantially in accord with chopper temperature components in the output signal of the infrared sensor 4 . The corrected chopper temperature data is applied to the infrared sensor output data for remov ing the chopper temperature components from the output signal of the infrared sensor to obtain a food temperature signal corresponding to the sole temperature of the food 2 .
