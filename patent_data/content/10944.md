# Improvements relating to load carrying platforms.

## Abstract
A load carrying platform 10 having a pair of end walls 13 movable between an upright and a collapsed condition. Each end wall 13 includes a pair of corner posts which are individually pivoted to pivots provided between rigid plates mounted at the corners of the plat form. The base of the corner post 15 is L shaped, the pivot being received in an arm of the L shape and being spaced from the end of the platform 10 so that rotation of the corner post 15 displaces it from its position between the plates. A cam locking bar is inserted through generally aligned openings in the post 15 and plates. The end walls 13 are resiliently biased upright by means which may comprise a torsion bar or a rotatable bar biased against rotation by spring means.
