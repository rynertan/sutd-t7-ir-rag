## Description
This invention relates to lubricant additives and compositions thereof and, more particularly, to lubricant compositions comprising oils of lubricating viscosity or greases prepared therefrom containing a minor friction reducing amount of a borated glycerol hydroxy ester. Many means have been employed to reduce overall friction in modern internal combustion engines, particularly automobile engines. The primary reasons are to reduce engine wear thereby prolonging engine life and to reduce the amount of fuel consumed by the engine thereby reducing the engine s fuel consumption. Many of the solutions to reducing fuel consumption have been strictly mechanical, as for example, setting the engines for a leaner burn or building smaller cars and smaller engines. However, considerable work has been done with lubricating oils, mineral and synthetic, to enhance their friction properties by modifying them with friction reducing additives. Glycerol hydroxyesters are known for their friction reducing properties when added to lubricant fluids. However, glycerol hydroxyesters do not adequately control bearing corrosion when used in automotive engine oil lubricants possibly because of their reactive OH groups. Borated glycerol hydroxyesters and borated sulfur containing hydroxyesters provide better friction reduction than their unborated counterparts and, in addition, reduce bearing corrosion to minimal, acceptable levels. This invention is directed to borated derivatives of glycerol hydroxyesters and borated derivatives of sulfur containing glycerol hydroxyesters. The glycerol or thioglycerol hydroxyesters have the following generalized structural formulae EMI2.1 where X is S or 0 and R contains from about 8 to 24 carbon atoms. In addition to these novel compounds, the invention is also directed to lubricant compositions containing these compounds having friction reducing properties and to a method of reducing fuel consumption in internal combustion engines by treating the moving surfaces thereof with said compositions. Further, these additive compounds also possess significantly improved antioxidant characteristics and bearing corrosion inhibiting properties. The borated derivatives of the present invention are produced by the reaction of a glycerol hydroxyester with boric acid in a suitable solvent or solvents at temperatures ranging from 900C to 2800C to yield products containing at least 0.01 or more of boron. Specific reaction conditions and molar equivalents of the reactants are well known in the art.Partial or complete boration can be used to impart the beneficial characteristics. An excess of a boron containing borating reagent can be used. More complete boration is generally preferred. Boration is not limited to the boric acid method, however, any convenient method of boration known to the art may be used. For example, transesterification using a trialkyl borate such as tributyl borate at reaction temperatures up to 270 C. The glycerol hydroxyesters and thioglycerol hydroxyesters may be prepared by any means known to the art or may be obtained commercially. A non exhaustive list of glycerol hydroxyesters and thioglycerol hydroxyesters useful herein include glycerol monooleate, glycerol dioleate, monothioglycerolmonooleate, monothioglycerol dioleate, dithioglycerolmonooleate, dithioglycerol dioleate, trithioglycerolmonooleate, trithioglycerol dioleate, glycerol monoricinoleate, glycerol diricinooleate, and in general, mono and diesters of glycerol or mono , di , and trithioglycerol such as glycerol laurates, etc. and monoand diesters such as glycerol laurates, myristates, palmitates., stearates, phenyl stearates, and unsaturated analogs thereof. Diglycerol di thioglycerol partial esters of diacids, yielding for example diglycerol adipates or sebacates, are other types of hydroxyesters included herein.Mixtures and various combinations of the above listed hydroxyesters and thiohydroxyesters are also useful herein. Thus pure esters or mixtures of esters such as a 60 40 mixture of glycerol monooleate glycerol dioleate may be borated. Mixtures can, on occasion, be preferable to the use of pure esters. The amount of additive required to be effective in lubricant compositions may range from 0.1 to about 10 by weight of the total lubricant composition. Preferred is from 0.5 to 5 wt. . The additives of this invention may be used in combination with any conventional additive for its known purpose, e.g., dispersants, surfactants, antiwear agents, in amounts of up to 10 wt. . The lubricants contemplated for use herein include both mineral and synthetic hydrocarbon oils of lubricating viscosity, mixtures of mineral and synthetic oils, and greases or other solid lubricants prepared therefrom. The synthetic hydrocarbon oils include long chain alkanes such as cetanes and olefin polymers such as trimers and tetramers of long chain 2 olefins These synthetic oils can be mixed with other synthetic oils which include 1 ester oils such as pentaerythritol esters of monocarboxylic acids having 2 to 20 carbon atoms, 2 polyglycol ethers, 3 polyacetals and 4 siloxane fluids. Especially useful among the synthetic esters are those made from polycarboxylic acids and monohydric alcohols.More preferred are the ester fluids made from pentaerythritol, and an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, or mixtures of such acids. EXAMPLE 1 Synthesis of Monothioglycerol Monooleate A mixture of l thioglycerol 70.5 g , 2 pentanone 277 g , and p toluene sulfonic acid 2 g was refluxed until the expected 20 cc. of water formed and was azeotroped off. Oleic acid 163 g was added to the reaction solution which was then refluxed until the expected 10 cc. of H20 azeotroped off. Toluene 800 cc. was added to the cooled reaction solution, which was then shaken with sodium acetate 6 g , washed withH20 4 x 400 cc. and dried over sodium sulfate. The toluene solution was filtered and the solvents removed via high speed rotary evaporation under reduced pressure. The resulting yellow fluid 190 g was refluxed in monomethyl ethylene glycol 520 cc. with boric acid 103 g at 100 C for 2 hours.Ether was added 875 cc. and the entire solution was transferred to a separatory funnel, washed with water 4 x 750 cc. , washed with 13 sodium bicarbonate solution 2 x 100 cc. and washed with water 2 x 100 cc. . The ether solution was shaken with sodium acetate 14 g and 100 cc. of water and then washed with a saturated sodium chloride solution 3 x 150 cc. . The ether solution was dried over magnesium sulfate, stripped free of solvent, and filtered through diatomaceous earth to yield a clear bright yellow oil. Gel permeation chromatography showed that the product was acid free oleic and contained approximately 80 monothioglycerol monooleate and 20 monothioglycerol dioleate. EXAMPLE 2 Borated Monothioglycerol Monooleate A mixture of monothioglycerol monooleate 214 g , boric acid 24 9 , and n butanol 127 g was refluxed at 100 to 140 0C until the theoretical amount of water, expected to form in the reaction, azeotroped off. The n butanol was distilled off under vacuum, and the resulting product residue was filtered yielding a clear, orange liquid. EXAMPLE 3 Borated Monothioglycerol Monooleate Monothioglycerol monooleate was borated in a manner identical to that of Example 2 except that the reaction was allowed to proceed until 80 of the expected water azeotroped off. The unreacted boric acid was filtered, and the n butanol was distilled off under vacuum. The resulting product was a clear orange fluid. EXAMPLE 4 Glycerol Monooleate obtained commercially EXAMPLE 5 Borated Glycerol Monooleate A mixture of glycerol monooleate 1900 g , boric acid 165 g , and n butanol 200 g was refluxed at 140 0C for 6 hours and 250 0C for 6 hours until all the water formed in the reaction had azeotroped off and solvent distilled over. No insolubles were visible in the resulting pale orange liquid product. EXAMPLE 6 Borated Glycerol Monooleate Using Excess BoricAcid A mixture of glycerol monooleate 1158 g , boric acid 202 g , and n butanol 300 g was refluxed at 275 0C for 6 7 hours until all the water and solvent had been removed. Filtration yielded a pale orange liquid product. EXAMPLE 7 Borated Glycerol Monoricinoleate A mixture of glycerol monoricinoleate 42 9 , boric acid 6.9 g , and n butanol 106 g were refluxed at 105 140 0C until all water formed in the reaction had azeotroped over. Solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure at 175 C. The resulting rust colored, very viscous product was sparingly soluble in mineral oils. Each of the above examples was then individually incorporated into a fully formulated 5W 20 engine oil having the following general characteristics KV 8 100 0C 6.8 cs KV 8 400C 36.9 cs VI 143 and evaluated using the Low Velocity Friction Apparatus.Certain of the examples were also subjected to the CRCL 38 Bearing Corrosion Test, which is a well known test, utilizing a single cylinder, spark ignited engine and which is designed to determine bearing corrosion and deposit forming characteristics of lubricants under high temperature oxidation conditions. Low Velocity Friction Apparatus LVFA The Low Velocity Friction Apparatus LVFA is used to measure the friction of test lubricants under various loads, temperatures, and sliding speeds. TheLVFA consists of a flat SAE 1020 steel surface having a diameter of 3.8 cm 1.5 in. which is attached to a drive shaft and rotated over a stationary, raised, narrow ringed SAE 1020 steel surface having a surface area of 50 mm2 0.08 in.2 . Both surfaces are submerged in the test lubricant. Friction between the steel surfaces is measured as a function of the sliding speed at a lubricant temperature of 1200C 2500F . The friction between the rubbing surfaces is measured using a torque arm strain gauge system. The strain gauge output, which is calibrated to be equal to the coefficient of friction, is fed to the Y axis of an X Y plotter.The speed signal from the tachometer generator is fed to the X axis. To minimize external friction, the piston is supported by an air bearing. The normal force loading the rubbing surfaces is regulated by air pressure on the bottom of the piston. The drive system consists of an infinitely variable speed hydraulic transmission driven by a 370.W output 1 2 HP electric motor. To vary the sliding speed, the output speed of the transmission is regulated by a lever cam motor arrangement. Procedure The rubbing surfaces and 12 13 ml. of test lubricant are placed on the LVFA. A 3400 k Pa load 500 psi is applied, and the sliding speed is maintained at 9. m min 30 fpm at ambient temperature for a few minutes. A plot of coefficients of friction Uk over a range of sliding speeds, 1.5 to 12 m min 5 to 40 fpm, 25 195 rpm , is obtained. A minimum of three measurements is obtained for each test lubricant. Then, the test lubricant and specimens are heated to 1200C 2500F , another set of measurements is obtained, and the system is run for 50 minutes at l200C 2500F , 3400 k Pa 500 psi , and 12 m min 40 fpm sliding speed. Freshly polished steel specimens are used for each run. The surface of the steel is parallel ground to 100 to 200 nm 4 to 8 microinches .The percentages by weight are percentages by weight of the total lubricating oil composition, including the usual additive package. The data are percent decrease in friction according to Uk of oil alone Uk Uk of Additive plus oil x 100 CUk of oil alone The value for the oil alone would be zero as shown in the Table below.

The test data establishes that the borated hydroxyesters and borated sulfur containing hydroxyesters are more efficient friction reducers than their non borated counterparts. A significant reduction in the coefficient of friction was observed relative to the base oil or the base oil containing the non borated monothioglycerol monooleate or glycerol monooleate.Furthermore, these borated derivatives retain anti friction behavior at low concentrations, i.e., 1 and 2 by weight. Also, the boration provides protection against bearing corrosion thereby imparting multi functional additive properties to the borated glycerol esters while the non borated glycerol hydroxyesters failed the L 38 test after only 40 hours.
