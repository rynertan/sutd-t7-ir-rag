# Aluminum lithium alloys.

## Abstract
An aluminum base alloy wrought product suitable for aging and having the ability to develop improved strength in response to an aging treatment without impairing fracture toughness properties is disclosed. The product is comprised of 0.5 to 4.0 wt. Li, 0 to 5.0 wt. Mg, up to 5.0 wt. Cu, 0 to 1.0 wt. Zr, 0 to 2.0 wt. Mn, 0 to 7 wt. Zn, 0.5 wt. max. Fe, 0.5 wt. max. Si, the balance aluminum and inciden tal impurities. The product has imparted thereto, prior to an aging step, a working effect equivalent to streching an amount greater than 3 in order that, after said aging, improved strength and fracture toughness combinations are obtained.
