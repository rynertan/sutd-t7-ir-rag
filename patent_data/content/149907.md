# ACTIVE CONNECTOR

## Abstract
An electrical connector having logic circuitry therein is taught. Briefly stated, a lower assembly 126 is profiled to receive a carrier strip 124 with an intermediate assembly 112 disposed on top of the carrier strip. A logic package 100 is placed in a window 118 in the intermediate assembly with the logic package having conductive pads 102 thereon which make electrical contact with portions 143 of the carrier strip. A polarized ribbon cable 104 is then placed into a channel 114 in the intermediate assem bly with a top assembly 90 having grooves 98 therein which are profiled to accept the polarized ribbon cable being placed on top thereof. The components are then fixedly mated together through the use of latches 92 and tabs 128 contained on the top and lower assembly. Insulation displac ing contacts 130, 132 which are part of the carrier strip and bent up therefrom protrude through the intermediate assem bly with the result that electrical contact is made with the individual conductors and the ribbon cable.
