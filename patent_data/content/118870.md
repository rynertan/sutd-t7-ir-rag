# Push button switch.

## Abstract
An improved push button switch which is so arranged that generation of heat at a journalled portion of a moveable piece is eliminated by forming contacts of the movable piece into double break contacts so that no current flows through the journalled portion, while a sufficient contact gap is available even when the push button switch is made into a compact size.
