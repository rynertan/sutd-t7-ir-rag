# Process for the electrolysis of an aqueous alkali metal halide solution, and electrolytic cell.

## Abstract
An electrolytic process is provided for the electro lysis of an aqueous alkali metal halide solution, which comprises effecting the electrolysis while supplying wash ing liquid 20 into a liquid seal pot 10 provided at a cathode gas outlet 6 of a cathode compartment a , said cell 1 being separated by a cation exchange mem brane into an anode compartment b and a cathode compartment a , and contacting cathode gas evolved with the washing liquid 20 of the liquid seal pot 10 . Also disclosed is an electrolytic cell 1 usable suitably for the above process which comprises a specifically fabricated liquid seal pot 10 and an electrolytic cell 1 which is partitioned by a cation exchange membrane into an anode compartment b and a cathode compart ment a . The invention not only enables recovery of cathode solution entrained by the cathode gas but also enables decrease in cell voltage by elevating the tem perature of the cell 1 by sensible heat of the cathode gas.
