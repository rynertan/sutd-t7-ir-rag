# Ultrasonic nondestructive tubing inspection system.

## Abstract
A system for measuring the extent of tube wall erosion in an inspection region of a heat exchanger tube of a nuclear steam generator, uses an ultrasonic means driven helically inside the eroded tube which may be filled with a fluid e.g., water to minimize ultrasonic wave attenuation. A control means cooperates with the ultrasonic means to produce a map of the tube wall thickness in an inspection region.
