The solution was poured into large amount of ethyl acetate to give a precipitate. The precipitate was collected and dried over phosphorus pentoxide to give benzhydryl 7β 2 cyclopropyloxyimino 2 2 formamidothiazol 4 yl acetamido 3 Z 2 1 methyl 3 pyridinio vinylthio 3 cephem 4 carboxylate iodide syn isomer 5.32 g as a solid. 7β 2 Cyclopropyloxyimino 2 2 formamidothiazol 4 yl acetamido 3 E 2 1 methyl 3 pyridinio thiovinyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylate hydriodide. syn isomer was obtained according to a similar manner to that of Example 115. To a solution of 7β 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 cyclopropyloxyimino acetamido 3 1 pyridinio methyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid hydrogen sulfate syn isomer 3 g in water 100 ml was portionwise added sodium borohydride 1.9 g under ice cooling, keeping the pH of the reaction mixture at 6.5 7.0 with 1N hydrochloric acid. The mixture was stirred at the same condition for 2.5 hours. The mixture was adjusted to pH 2.5 with 6N hydrochloric acid and subjected to column chromatography on a non ionic adsorption resin Diaion HP 20 90 ml . After the column was washed with water 630 ml , the elution was carried out with 20 methanol. The fractions containing the object compound were combined, concentrated in vacuo to about 100 ml, and lyophilized to give 7β 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 cyclopropyloxyimino acetamido 3 1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridin 1 yl methyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid syn isomer 0.35 g . A suspension of 7β 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 cyclopropyloxyimino acetamido cephalosporanic acid syn isomer 0.97 g in water was adjusted to pH 13 with 4N aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide under ice cooling to give a clear solution. After stirred for 3 hours at the same temperature, the solution was adjusted to pH 4.5 with 1N hydrochloric acid and subjected to column chromatography on a non ionic adsorption resin Diaion HP 20 40 ml . After the column was washed with water 80 ml , the elution was carried out with 10 isopropyl alcohol 120 ml . The fractions containing the object compound were combined and concentrated in vacuo to driness. The residue was triturated with acetone to give sodium 7β 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 cyclopropyloxyimino acetamido 3 hydroxymethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylate syn isomer 1 g as a solid. To a solution of 7β 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 cyclopropyloxyimino acetamido 3 1 pyridinio methyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylate syn isomer 750 mg in water 50 ml was added concentrated sulfuric acid 0.0679 ml .
