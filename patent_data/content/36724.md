# Process for the production of ethanol by the liquid phase hydrocarbonylation of methanol.

## Abstract
A process for the production of a product comprising ethanol which process comprises reacting at elevated temper ature and pressure and in the liquid phase methanol with hy drogen and carbon monoxide in the presence of an inert, parti culate solid comprising a high surface area form of silica, alu mina, silica alumina or carbon, a methanol soluble catalyst comprising either i cobalt as the sole catalytic metal entity added either as cobalt carbonyl or bis triphenylphosphine iminium tetracar bonylcobaltate or in a form capable of forming a carbonyl and or a carbonyl hydride complex under the prevailing reac tion conditions, or ii a metal of Group VIII of the Periodic Table excluding ir on, palladium and platinum as the sole catalytic metal entity added either as a metal complex in which the ligand is derived from cyclopentadiene or a substituted cyclopentadiene of for mula
