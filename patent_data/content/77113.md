# Olefin oligomerization using boron trifluoride and a three component cocatalyst.

## Abstract
Olefin oiigomers suitable as lubricants are prepared with a catalyst comprising boron trifiuoride and a mix ture of an alcohol, a polyol and a ketone. 1 Decene is oligomerized to a liquid product having a high trimer to tetramer ratio using boron trifluoride and a mixture of n butanol, ethylene glycol and methylethyl ketone.
