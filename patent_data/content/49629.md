# Redundancy scheme for a dynamic RAM.

## Abstract
A redundancy scheme for replacing defective main memory cells 10 24 in a dynamic RAM with spare memory cells 38 48 . The spare cells are arranged in groups of spare rows 38 44 and spare columns 46, 48 of memory cells such that a plurality of groups of spare rows and columns of cells are substituted for defective main rows and columns of cells so as to repair relatively large defects which impair adjacent rows and columns of main memory cells. The RAM includes a plurality of address buffers 64 , each of which receives an incoming row address bit and then an incoming column address bit for sequentially outputting row and column address data. Associated with each buffer 64 is a store 70, 72 for a defective row address, a store 74, 76 for a defective column address, and a comparator 78, 80, 82 86, 88, 90 . The stores 70 76 retain defective memory cell addresses which the comparator 78, 80, 82 86, 88, 90 sequentially compares against the address data sequentially output by the buffer 64 . Then the comparator senses a match, a control signal Sl is generated to initiate substitu tion of spare memory cells for the defective main memory cells.
