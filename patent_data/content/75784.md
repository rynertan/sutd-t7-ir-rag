# Process for direct gold plating of stainless steel.

## Abstract
Stainless steel can be directly plated with gold by a process wherein stainless steel is dipped in an activating solution the activated stainless steel is subjected to cathodic electrolysis in a cathode electrolytic activation solution and then the treated stainless steel is directly plated with gold. A preferable activating solution contains i 3 20 wt. of HCl, ii 2 30 wt. of H₂SO₄, iii 0.1 5 wt. of a nonionic or cationic surfactant and iv 0.1 20 wt. of 2 pyrrolidone or N alkyl 2 pyrrolidone. A preferable cathode electrolytic acti vation solution contains ii 5 20 wt. of H₃PO₄ ii 2 10 HNO₃, iii 0.1 5 wt. of a nonionic or cationic surfactant and iv 0.1 20 wt. of 2 pyrrolidone or N alkyl 2 pyrrolidone.
