## Description
ELECTRICAL WIRE AND CONTACT COATING COMPOSITION Technical Field This invention relates to a coating composition for electrical wires and connectors. The composition renders water repellant and protects electrical wire, especially communication wire the composition is also an electrical contact enhancing composition for coating onto low pressure sliding or slidable connections, and more specifically onto pin and socket type connectors. In another aspect, it relates to a process for waterproofing and protecting electrical wire. In a further aspect, it relates t articles coated with the electrical contact enhancing composition of the present invention. Background Art Paper and polyethylene insulated electrical wire may suffer from degradation of its protective covering.This degradation can result in failure of the electrical properties of the wire or cause it to short out. A further problem exists with spiral wrapped paper insulation.Splicing and other handling of the wire tends to result in exposure of the copper core. Particularly, such handling can cause unravelling of the spiral wrapped paper insulation. To overcome this problem without expensive rewiring, field applied spray insulation, for example, an aliphatic polyurethane system has been developed. This system has utility for polyethylene insulated wires, but has not been found to be useful on paper. Electrical connectors subject to plug and unplug motion often suffer from wear, such as fretting, and increased contact resistance due to atmospherically induced corrosion of the contact caused by humidity, pollutants, and oxidation. In the prior art, microcrystalline waxes are known as contact enhancing compositions. In addition, antioxidant lubricating fluids, e.g., a wide variety of natural and synthetic materials such as polyphenyl esters, natural and synthetic hydrocarbons, esters, polyglycols, fluorinated materials, and silicones have been used on electrical connectors to decrease this wear and the corrosion to which they are subject.Since most fluid lubricants are insulators, their use can actually serve to minimize or entirely prevent the desired metallic contact, and contact resistance between sliding surfaces may be very high e Gold plating of contacts or contact points is practiced in the art due to the outstanding electrical properties of gold and its known inertness to corrosion.However, the high cost of this metal has made it desirable to eliminate gold plated contacts. There remains a need in the art for electrical wire protecting and contacfr enhancing compositions which can provide a high degree of environmental protection to pulp, polyethylene, and paper insulated wires and tocontacts made of metals such as copper alloys coated with metals such as tin, tin lead, and silver, and which compositions can provide good electrical performance. It is novel in the art to provide a sprayable field applied insulation which is a solvent containing mixture comprising an anhydride copolymer, a flexibilizing polymer, and a fluorochemical compound, the mixture being inexpensive, easily applied, having good electrical characteristics, drying rapidly, resisting moisture, thermally stable at pedestal temperatures, non flammable, having good clarity so color coding is not affected, and actually having a contact enhancing effect on connectors and having no effect on other hardware normally used in wIre splicing and terminating, and useful for pulp, polyethylene, and paper insulated wires. Disclosure of Invention Briefly, the present invention provides an electrical wire and electrical contact enhancing composition useful to maintain the integrity of new paper insulated wire and restorative for wire on which paper or polyethylene insulation has degraded or unraveled and useful for coating on low pressure sliding connections the cornposition comprising an admixture of an anhydride copolymer, a flexibilizing copolymer, a hydrophobic, soluble, compatible fluoroaliphatic radical containing composition, optionally an antioxidant, optionally a mercaptan, and a suitable solvent system, and articles made therefrom. The invention provides a composition having adhesive properties towards paper, polyethylene, polycarbonate, and metal, particularly copper, dissolved in a nonflammable mixture of organic solvents. It is compatible with polycarbonate connectors known to stress crack due to polycarbonate solubility in many solvents. Since insulation restorative compositions are frequently used in enclosed areas such as indoors and in manholes, and on live wires, the liquid composition is non flammable. It penetrates and is absorbed into the wire insulation surface, and upon drying, bonds paper to itself, and tightly seals cracks in polyethylene. It re establishes a thin layer of insulation where the paper insulation has degraded or the polyethylene has cracked. The dried composition acts as an insulative overcoat on exposed copper wires of connections.The dried coating composition has good clarity, so wire color coding will not be affected. Es an electrical contact enhancing composition, the invention provides a soft, deformable coating composition to form a skin on a connecting block electrical receptor made of an insulating material, which can be any thermoplastic, such as polycarbonate, polypropylene, polyethylene, polyurethane, polyphenyl oxide, or nylon any thermoset plastic such as phenolic, urea, or melamine formaldehydes, or ceramic, such as porcelain and contacts in it made of metals such as copper alloys, tin, silver, gold, steels or stainless steels. The connecting block wi its contacts or receptors, and a set of pins made of metals such as copper alloys or stainless steels forms a mating pair of electrical contacts.When plugged in, each pin displaces the deformable coating composition in at least one area of the receptor so as to provide direct metal to metal contact between the pin and receptor, thereby providing good electrical conductivity, while the composition seals the contact area from the environment. Upon pin removal, due to the spring load type of contact used in the art, wiping action between pin and receptacle and composition results, and the composition is thereby reapplied to the exposed metal surfaces. Upon re insertion of the pin in the receptacle, the same or a new metal surface on both pin and receptor is exposed. Generally, the area of exposed metal becomes larger as the plug unplug process continues. Continuous wiping action results in the retardation of pin oxidation and weatherability of the terminal block is thereby provided.The coating has sufficient resiliency and adherence so that it seals firmly to the metals and plastics or ceramics used in the receptacle block and pins. Desirable properties of a contact enhancing composition includes the following lubricity to reduce friction and wear, non volatility to prolong times between re lubrication, fretting protection by shutting out the atmosphere during motion of parts, low creep to avoid contamination elsewhere and to avoid the need for re lubrication, oxidative stability so as not to form insulating resins in situ, and compatibility so as not to interact with metallic or nonmetallic materials around the contact. Detailed Description The electrical wire and contact enhancing coating composition of the present invention comprises an admixture of an effective amount, preferably 8 to 75 weight percent of the dried compositIon of an anhydride copolymer to provide adherence to metals, plastics, ceramics, pulp and paper, an effective amount, preferably 8 to 75 weight percent of the dried composition of a flexibilizing polymer to provide deforming properties to the composition, an effective amount, preferably 5 to 75 weight percent of the dried composition of a hydrophobic, soluble, compatible fluoroaliphatic radical containing composition or polymer, to provide water repellancy and lubricating properties to the composition, o to 10 weight percent of the dried composition of a mercaptan compound to improve insulative properties between wires or between neighboring contacts, and 0 to 20 weight percent of the dried composition, and most preferably 1.5 to 18 weight percent, of an antioxidant to prevent oxidation of the metal surfaces. In the present application compatible means a clear to slightly translucent non separating polymer mixture and deformable means capable of changing in shape so as to expose contact surfaces. As a wire coating composition, most preferably the present invention comprises an admixture of weights refer to the dried composition 35 to 70 weight percent of an anhydride copolymer, 10 to 41 weight percent of a flexibilizing polymer, 10 to 40 weight percent of a fluoroaliphatic radical containing composition, 0 to 10 weight percent of a mercaptan compound, and 0 to 5 percent by weight andmost preferably 2 percent by weight of an antioxidant composition.The wire coating composition is dissolved at a level of 4 to 12 percent by weight of the total solution, preferably 6 to 9 percent by weight, dissolved in a solvent system comprising 88 to 96 percent by weight of the total solution, the solvent system being a mixture of C6 to Cg aliphatic hydrocarbons, lower molecular weight alcohols i.e., C1 toC4 , and trichlorotrifluoroethane. To provide a nonflammable solvent mixture the level of trichlorotrifluoroethane should be from 75 to 95 percent by weight of the solvents and preferably 80 to 90 percent. The aliphatic hydrocarbons comprise 10 to 25 percent by weight of the solvent mixture and the alcohols comprise 0.5 to 15 percent by weight of the solvent mixture. As an electrical contact enhancing composition, more preferably the present invention comprises an admixture of weights refer to the dried composition 10 to 67 weight percent of an anhydride copolymer, 10 to 57 weight percent of a flexibilizing polymer, 7 to 68 weight percent of a fluoroaliphatic radi al containing composition, 0 to 7 weight percent, most preferably 0.05 to 1.0 weight percent, of a mercaptan compound, and 1.0 to 20 percent by weight, most preferably 1.5 to 18 percent by weight, of an antioxidant composition.The electrical contact enhancing composition is dissolved at a level of 4 to 30 percent by weight of the total solution, preferably 10 to 20 percent by weight of the total solution, in a nonflammable solvent system comprising a mixture of C6 to Cg aliphatic hydrocarbons, lower molecular weight C1 to C4 alcohols, and trichlotrifluoroethane.Aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as heptane or hexane, comprise 5 to 35 percent by weight of the solvent system, and lower molecular weight alcohols such as isopropyl alcohol comprise 0.5 to 25 percent, and trichlorotrifluoroethane Freon TF, E. I. Dupont de Nemours Corp. comprises 30 to 90 percent, preferably 50 to 80 percent, by weight of the solvent system. The anhydride copolymer component is an anhydride which is an alkyl , phenyl or phenylalkyl substituted or unsubstituted cyclic anhydride in which each alkyl group can contain 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and the cyclic group can contain 4 to 15 carbon atoms, such as maleic or itaconic anhydride copolymerized with a C10 to C24 aliphatic hydrocarbon, and preferably the copolymer is maleic anhydride octadecene copolymer PA 18, Gulf Oil ChemicalsCo. , maleic anhydride decene copolymer PA lO, Gulf OilChemicals Co. , or maleic anhydride tetradecene copolymer PA 14, Gulf Oil Chemicals Co. . The anhydride copolymer is present in an amount sufficient to provide adhesion to a number of substrates, for example, polyethylene, polycarbonate, and metals such as copper, and some adhesion to paper. Due to the brittle nature of the anhydride copolymer as well as its susceptibility to hydrolysis in the presence of water which leads to low insulation resistance and corrosion of metals, and due to its insuL icient adhesion to subs i ra tes, it has been Eouni that a flexibilizing polymer such as polyisobutylene, styrene olefin styrene block polymer, or ethylene copolymerized with vinyl acetate, acrylate esters, methacrylate esters, or alpha olefins, provides improvement. The flexibilizing polymer is a rubbery, compatible, adherent material present in an amount sufficient to provide a soft, flexible coating. Desirably it is soluble in the solven system.Preferably it is an ethylene vinylacetate copolymer with 33 vinyl acetate Elvax 150R, E. I DuPont de NemoursCorp. or an ethylene vinylacetate copolymer with 28 vinyl acetate Elvax 240R or Elvax 250R, E. I. Dupont de NemoursCorp . The composition of the present invention also includes a hydrophobic, soluble, compatible fluoroaliphatic radical containing composition, i.e., compounds or polymers, or mixtures thereof, to provide hydrophobicity to the mixture so as to result in a water repellant product. By fluoroaliphatic radical is meant a monovalent, fluorinated, aliphatic, preferably saturated, organic radical havincj an average of at least 5 to 14 carbon atoms. The skeletal chain or the radical can be straight, branched, or, if sufficiently large, cyclic, and can be interrupted by divalent oxygen atoms or trivalent nitrogen atoms bonded only to carbon atoms.Preferably, it is fully fluorinated, but hydrogen or chlorine atoms can be present as substituents on the skeletal chain, provided that not more than one atom of either hydrogen or chlorine is present for every two carbon atoms in the skeletal chain, and the radical contains at least a terminal perfluoromethyl group.Preferably, the radical has about 6 to 10 carbon atoms.The fluoroaliphatic radical containing compositions of this invention can contain radicals which are the same as, or different from, one another. The fluoroaliphatic radicalcontaining compositions include vinyl polymers such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,89,25l. narticularly useful are acrylate polymers with urethane containing side chains, blends of fluoroaliphatic radicals containing acrylate polymers and fluorocarbon compounds or adducts such as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,215,205. Compounds which are useful include adducts of fluoroaliphatic radical containing alcohols and organic isocyanates such as the urethane adduct of two moles of N ethylperfluoroalkylsufonamidoethanol and one mole toluene diisocyanate, which adduct is hereinafter referred to as Compound I 3M . A particularly useful polymer is 57 28 15 N methylperfluorooctylsulfonamidoethyl methacrylateN ethylperfluorooctylsulfonamidoethylalcohol toluene 2,4diisocyanate hydroxypropyl methacrylate butyl acrylate, hereinafter referred to as Compound II 3M , and a polymer adduct mixture, hereinafter referred to as Compound III 3M and contains 31.5 parts by weight of methyl N methylperfluorooctyl sulfonamidoethylacrylate 31.5 parts by weight of butyl N methylperfluorooctyl sulfonamido methacrylate 18 parts by weight of dimethacrylate of 2000 molecular weight tetra methylene oxide diol Polymeg 2000, Quaker Oats Co. 9 parts by weight of butyl acrylate, and 10 parts by weight of N ethylperfluorooctyl sulfonamido ethanol toluene diisocyanate adduct which has been converted to carbodiimide.Other useful fluoroaliphatic vinyl containing polymers are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,803,615, 3,462,296, 3,950,298, 3,574,791 ex. 17 , and 3,787,351. Up to 10 weight percent of the dried composition of a soluble, compatible silane mercaptan having 4 to 17 carbon atoms such as 1 the class of omega trialkoxysilylalkylmercaptans, wherein the alkoxy group has up to 3 carbon atoms C1 is preferred and the alkyl group has 2 to 8 carbon atoms, exemplified by gamma mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane A 189, Union Carbide , or 2 an alkyl or alkoxy mercaptan of 4 to 24 carbon atoms, exemplified by octadecene mercaptan, in the composition inhibits corrosion of the metal. A sufficient amount of an antioxidant is included in the formulation to prevent oxidation of the exposed metal surfaces. Suitable antioxidants include a hindered phenol suh as tetrakis methylene 3 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionatelmethane Irgaox 1010R,Ciba Geigy Corp. , thiodiethylene bis 3,5 di tert butyl4 hydroxy hydrocinnamate Irganox 1035R, Ciba Geigy Corp. , or octadecyl 3 3 ,51 di tert butyl 41 hydroxyphenyl propionate Irganox 1076R, Ciba Geigy Corp. , a copper ion scavenger and antioxidant such as MD1024 Ciba GeigyCorp. , or a compound such as distearyl thiodipropionate Cyanox STDP, kmerican Cyanamid Polymer and Chem. Dept. . For ease of application, the composition is in solution form. Since polycarbonate is widely used in the communication field, and since polycarbonate is susceptible to being soluble in certain solvents, solvents useful in the present invention solvate the anhydride and flexi bilizing polymers, but not the polycarbonate. The solvent mixture provides the desired solubility for the components of the mixture and not to polycarbonate, and also provides a suitable evaporation rate after application. Freon TF provides non flammability to the coating composition. This property is desirable due to the frequent application of the composition in enclosed areas, such as indoors or in manholes, and also on live wires. The composition of the present invention, which is insulative on electrical wires and between neighboring contacts but deformable under contact spring pressure to allow metal to metal contact, is applied in a thickness in the range of 25 to 250 microns, preferably 25 to 50 microns as a wire coating composition, and preferably 50 to 180 microns ac a contact enhancing composition, and may be sprayed o brushed onto the connecting block, but preferably it is dipped. The composition dries to a tack free state at ambient conditions in 10 to 40 minutes.The evaporation rate, desirably, is slow enough so as not to clog a spray head, and fast enough so as to result in a reasonably rapid drying speed for the applied composition. The wire coating composition is useful to form a smooth coated film on bare wire or on degraded paper or polyethylene insulated wire in the field. It is also useful in maintaining the integrity of spiral wrapped paper wires. The electrical contact enhancing composition will form a smooth, deformable, resilient, adherent film on low pressure sliding electrical connections. It is useful when replacing gold plate contacts with copper alloys coated with metals such as tin, tin lead, and silver or it allows the use of very thin gold plate. Objects and advantages of this invention are further illustrated by the following examples, but the particular materials and amounts thereof recited in these examples, as well as other conditions and details, should not be construed to unduly limit this invention. Example 1 samples 1 to 21 relates to wire coating compositions and Examples 2 to 5 samples 22 to 52 relate to electrical contact enhancing compositions. Example 1 The following method was used to prepare sample compositions 1 19 of TABLE I. In a suitable vessel the indicated amounts of antioxidant, flexibilizing polymer, aliphatic hydrocarbon, and low molecular weight alcohol were heated and stirred to 550C. When the flexibilizing polymer was dissolved, the anhydride copolymer was added.This was stirred until it was dissolved. Then the temperature of the mixture was adjusted to 350C and Freon TF was added. The temperature was maintained at 350C and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes.

FC fluorocarbon polymer compound II, see above , except for j fluorocarbon polymer compound I, see above A satisfactory contact enhancing composition provides protection against insulation resistance IR degradation in both humid and corrosive salt fog environments. It also provides maintenance of a low connection resistance at contact interfaces. Many samples gave satisfactory results in any one test, but a useful contact enhancing composition provided good results in all tests. All evaluations utilized the industry standard 5 pin num 3AB protectors and 10 pair receptacle blocks no. R713 l Reliable Electric Co., Franklin Park, IT, . The receptacles were coated with the sample compositions ofTABLE III to provide a dried film 25 to 75 microns thick.In each test, samples were uniformly coated. Example 2 Compositions 22 52 of TABLE III were prepared using the method of Example 1. Insulation resistance, measured in ohms, was used to define electrical circuit isolation. Only the median value in each set is reported. The normal standard is in the range of 106 to 108 ohms minimum. A high temperature and high humidity test, run essentially as described in AT Network Department product Evaluation Report l49, Issue 2, 112.0107, was conducted under high temperature and high humidity conditions 520C and 90 95 percent relative humidity . Humidity absorption and subsequent hydrolysis of an insulating composition resulted in insulation resistance degradation. Data collected initially and after 4 hours, 1 day, 2 days, and 3 days is shown in TABLE IV for samples 22 30, 39, 49, and 5 from TABLE III and a control sample which was uncoated.

GoodIR results were obtained with samples 24, 26, 29, 30, 39, 49p 50 and the control. Example 3 A second test for insulation resistance was conducted in a salt fog atmosphere, essentially as described in ASTM test method B117 61. The prepared samples were subjected to a direct salt water spray.Simultaneously 50 volts DC was applied to adjacent tip and ring terminals. The resistances in ohms initially and after 24 hours are shown in TABLE V. The control sample receptacle block, a copper alloy contact with tin lead plate, was uncoated.

Materials, such as some plastics and rubbers, which are good insulators gene ally prevent or hinder connection resistance.The compositions of the present invention are deformed and displaced by pin insertion, thus allowing electrical contact. Oxidation at the contact interface leads to high connection resistance. The Thermal Aging test, run essentially as disclosed in AT Business Services EvaluationCriteria Flat Undercarpet Telephone Cable bulletin,Appendix F, March 10, 1980, was conducted to measure the effect of aging on a connection. Dry heat 118 C was used for 34 days, with readings of the contact interface, ir miiliohms, taken at 2, 8, 16, and 34 days. A terminatinn system coated with the composition of sample 39 of TAst TTI and an uncoated control sample were used, as shown Ln TABLE VI.
