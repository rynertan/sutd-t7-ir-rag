# Heat developable color light sensitive materials.

## Abstract
Heat developable color image forming material has a layer containing a light sensitive silver halide grains b a redox compound having a hydrophilic releasable dye moiety and a reducing group which, on heating, reduces imagewise exposed silver halide, mobile dye being then released, and c a compound which, on heating, releases a base, of a general formula Compound C preferably is 0.01 30 by weight of the coating s 50 compounds are shown, with synthesis exam ples. Other basic substances or precursors can be present. Development is by dry heating at 80 250 C. to form a silver image and dye image which is transferred to unitary or separate fixing layer. The material has good storage life and gives dye images of high density.
