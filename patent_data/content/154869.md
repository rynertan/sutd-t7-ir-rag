# Ultrasonic measurement apparatus.

## Abstract
A wideband ultrasonic pulse is transmitted into an object and received as an echo signal following reflection within the object. An acoustic characteristic of the object is then mea sured based on position and frequency information contained in the echo signal. The measured acoustic characteristic is re presentative of information relating to degree of attenuation and frequency dependence thereof inside the object. The associated apparatus displays an image of the dis tribution of the acoustic characteristic within the object in the form of a real time spectra colour tomograph.
