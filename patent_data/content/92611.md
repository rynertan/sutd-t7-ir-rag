# Speech analysis system.

## Abstract
Speech analysis system in which segments of speech are analyzed. For the voiced unvoiced decision use is made of the average magnitude or waveform intensity of succes sive speech segments. Basically a voiced decision is made when the waveform intensity increases monotonically over several segments by more than a given factor. An unvoiced decision is made if the waveform intensity drops below a given fraction of the maximum waveform intensity in the current voiced period. Refinements in the decisions are made by the use of fixed and adaptive thresholds. Used in vocoders.
