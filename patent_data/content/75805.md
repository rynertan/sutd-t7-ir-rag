Then, the water is added to the reaction mixture, and the organic layer is washed with water, twice with a saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, once with a saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, and then three times with a saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and then the solvent is distilled off to obtain 35 g of oily matter hereinafter referred to as crude aldehyde compound . The crude aldehyde compound is purified by silica gel chromatography Wako gel C 200, 600 ml elution n hexane ethyl acetate 1 1 V V , whereby 28.3 g of the desired compound as a diastereomer mixture is obtained as crystalline oily matter.
