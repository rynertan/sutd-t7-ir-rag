# Stepper motor damping system.

## Abstract
The stepper motor damping control system and method is realized by switching the power supply connection s of energized motor phase windings alternatively ON and OFF at a predetermined relatively high fixed rate. Said switching is performed by the predrive control processing circuit 14 using a clock signal information CLK for switching one way and an information denoting equality between a voltage substantially proportional to the current flowing through said motor phase windings SENSE SIGNALS with a predetermined sawtooth sloped reference signal Vref syn chronized with said clock signal for switching the other way.
