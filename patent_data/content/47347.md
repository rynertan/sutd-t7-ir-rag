## Description
Apparatus for separating gas and solids from a liquid This invention relates to apparatus for separating gas and solids from a liquid, and particularly to such apparatus for use in a closed loop drilling fluid circulation system for handling drilling cuttings and produced gas. Much of the drilling fluid technology was developed by the oil and gas industry. Typically, a drilling mud is pumped down a drill string in a well being drilled from the surface, circulated back up the outside of the drill string to an open tank or reservoir at the surface, and recirculated down the drill string.Usually the return discharge empties into an open screen or other cuttings removal device. Horizontal drilling in coal mines has been investigated recently as a technique for degasification of a coal seam in advance of mining. Drilling of one or more boreholes a distance of 300 meters or more into a coal seam and recovering methane therefrom significantly reduces the methane concentration in the working area of a mine during later mining of the seam. One of the problems encountered in horizontal drilling through a coal seam is that the working area is relatively small and enclosed, such that gas produced from the borehole being drilled, if released into the working area, presents a significant hazard. Prior art attempts to solve this problem have employed a liquid seal in the drilling fluid circulation system that forms a barrier between the mine atmosphere and the gas discharge point. However, because of surges in the gas flow this type of liquid seal was often blown out or made ineffective due to being plugged by drill cuttings. Viewed from one aspect the invention provides apparatus for separating gas and solids from a liquid, comprising first and second closed compartments, an inlet for admitting gas, solids and liquid into the second compartment in which solids settle, means for collecting and removing solids which settle in said second compartment, means providing liquid communication between said first and second compartments, means providing gas communication between upper regions of said first and second compartments, an outlet for removing gas from said upper regions, and an outlet for liquid from said first compartment. Viewed from another aspect the invention provides a drilling system using such apparatus in a closed loop separation system for handling drilling fluid, gas and cuttings. The invention is particularly applicable to systems for drilling horizontal boreholes in underground situations, for example in coal seams.The system allows for gas produced during drilling to be prevented from release in the working area. The separation system eliminates the need for a gas trap, whilst drilling fluid is contained in closed compartments and spillage can be avoided. Two embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is an illustration of a drilling system in accordance with the present invention Figure 2 is a side elevation, partially broken away, showing a first embodiment of apparatus in accordance with the invention for use in the system of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a cross section taken along the line 3 3 of Figure 2 and Figure 4 is a side elevation, partially cut away, showing another embodiment of apparatus in accordance with the invention for use in the system of Figure 1. In Figure 1 there is illustrated a drilling system used in an underground mine for drilling long horizontal degasification holes in a coal seam in advance of mining the seam to reduce the methane concentration in the working area during mining. The drilling system includes a drill unit 10 and a separate car 11 in the working area of the underground mine. The drill unit 10 provides thrust and torque to a drill string 12 which will carry a drill bit, and drilling fluid circulates from the tender car 11 down through supply line 17 to drill string 12 and back up the outside of drill string 12 through return line 13 to a separator 30 on tender car 11. A make up drilling fluid line 14, overflow drilling fluid line 15 and gas exhaust line 16 are all connected to separator 30, which will be described in more detail below. During drilling, methane gas from the coal seam escapes into the drilling fluid being circulated. It is desirable that this associated gas not be released in the working environment, and there is thus a closedloop circulation system designed to assure that the associated gas produced during the drilling operation does not get released in the working area. A preferred embodiment of separator 30 is shown in detail in Figures 2 and 3. Thus, separator 30 is in the form of a sealed container including a clean fluid compartment 31 and a settling compartment 32, separated by a wall 36. Clean fluid compartment 31 includes a low level control float valve 33 connected to make up fluid line 14 to maintain the liquid level in separator 30 above an outlet 18 leading to the suction side of a circulation pump not shown for supplying drilling fluid to drill string 12 through supply line 17. Clean fluid compartment 31 also includes a high level control float valve 34 associated with an overflow line 15 to maintain liquid free upper gas containing sections in compartments 31 and 32.Thus the minimum and maximum levels of liquid in the compartments can be controlled and the level maintained within a predetermined range. A pressure equalising port 35 in the upper end of wall 36 between compartments 31 and 32 allows for free flow of gas between the compartments. Wall 36 also has a plurality of horizontal slots 37 Figure 3 to allow passage of cleaned drilling fluid from settling compartment 32 to clean fluid compartment 31.As shown in Figures 2 and 3, a series of separator plates 38 extend at an incline downwardly into compartment 32 from below each slot 37 in wall 36 to effect separation of fine cuttings material from drilling fluid flowing from settling compartment 32 to clean fluid compartment 31. Drilling fluid containing drilling cuttings and associated gas enters compartment 32 through return line 13. Compartment 32 has a series of spaced baffles 39, 40 and 41 along its length which act as overflow barriers of decreasing height. Coarse drilling cuttings settle in the chambers formed by these baffles, and partially cleaned fluid flows over the baffles toward wall 36. Gas contained in the returning drilling fluid is released and collects in the upper sections of compartments 31 and 32. The gas can then be vented through gas exhaust line 16 to a safe location away from the working area. The bottom of separator 30 has a solids removal device including an open trough 42 in compartment 32 for collecting settled drilling cuttings. An auger or screw 43 is provided for removing accumulated cuttings through a closed conduit 44 under compartment 31 to a cuttings discharge outlet 45. In use, the drilling unit 10 is positioned in the mine working area. The tender car 11 which provides hydraulic power and other auxiliary services to the drilling unit is located nearby. A casing 60 is cemented or otherwise fixed in position in the initial part of a borehole, and drilling fluid return line 13 is attached to a connection coming off casing 60. Clean drilling fluid from separator 30 is pumped through line 17 to drill string 12 as the drilling unit is being used to drill the borehole.The drilling unit 10 or other conventional drilling unit is operated in a known manner to form a long generally horizontal borehole in the coal seam. As the hole progresses, drilling cuttings and associated gas are returned along with the circulating drilling fluid through return line 13 to separator 30 where cuttings and gas are removed and clean drilling fluid is circulated back to the drilling unit 10. The gas associated with the returning drilling fluid is withdrawn through gas exhaust line 16 and vented to a safe location such as an aboveground location. Additional drilling fluid is provided by make up line 14 to maintain the amount of drilling fluid sufficient to fill the hole as it is drilled and to enable operation of the separator 30. The operation of separator 30 as shown in Figures 2 and 3 will now be described. Returning circulating fluid including drill cuttings and associated gas enter separator 30 through return line 13. The heavier cuttings settle immediately to the bottom of the separator and are collected in the trough 42 for later removal. Partially clarified drilling fluid overflows baffle 39 and additional drilling cuttings settle to the trough 42. The circulating fluid serially overflows baffles 39, 40 and 41, which are progressively lower until it reaches the section occupied by separator plates 38. The fluid then moves upwardly over separator plates 38 and through slots 37 into the clean fluid compartment 31. Unsettled fines collect on the plates 38 and are not transferred into compartment 31.The associated gas from the drilling fluid is exhausted through line 16 to a safe location, preferably above ground. The fluid level in separator 30 is maintained within a desired predetermined range by low level control 33 which provides make up fluid to the separator, and by high level control 34 which prevents the liquid level from approaching gas exhaust line 16. At the end of a working shift, or whenever the level of settled cuttings requires it, the auger 43 is operated and settled cuttings are removed through cuttings discharge outlet 45. In the embodiment shown in Figure 4, the parts of the separator are generally the same as the version shown in Figures 2 and 3 except that instead of the plate separator a centrifugal separator 50 is used to remove fine cuttings from the circulating drilling fluid. A pump 51 draws fluid from the settling compartment and pumps it to centrifugal separator 50 where clean fluid is taken off through line 52 and put in the clean fluid compartment while solidscontaining fluid is returned through line 53 to the settling compartment. Instead of the series of slots 37 as used in the embodiment in Figures 2 and 3, a fine screen 54 is provided between the compartments to maintain a uniform fluid level in each compartment while keeping fine cuttings out of the clean fluid compartment. The operation of the version of the separator illustrated in Figure 4 is identical to that of the previous embodiment except that centrifugal separator 50 and screen 54 are used in place of the separator plates 38 and slots 37 to remove fine cuttings and maintain a uniform liquid level between the two compartments. A pressure relief valve not shown may be provided to protect against the gas exhaust line 16 becoming plugged, although the separator 30 is designed to handle a substantial pressure. Numerous other modifications, additions and variations could be utilised. For example, the fine cuttings removal means could be a series of progressively smaller screens between the two compartments, and mechanisms other than the auger could be utilised to remove the settled cuttings from the separator. The drilling system as described above is only one version to which the present invention applies.For example, the closed loop separation system described in detail below could also be ultised with a downhole motor drilling system and could be used for drilling in other than coal seams. However, the invention is especially suitable for drilling horizontal degasification holes in coal seams. Thus, at least in the preferred embodiments, it is possible to ensure safe and efficient separation of drill cuttings, gas and clLè an dril Iing fluid.
