# Powered desk.

## Abstract
A powered desk is described. The desk has a work surface supported by a base consisting of a pair of generally vertical support members connected by an elongate, gener ally horizontal structural member which has a hollow interior. The ends of the structural member are mounted in annular openings formed in the vertical support members, with end faces exposed and accessible. Electrical connectors are mounted in the opposing end faces and are connected by electrical wiring extending through the interior of the structural member, whereby electric power or signals can be transferred across the full length of the desk and coupled by a suitable jumper to a similar desk. Additionally, electrical connectors are mounted along the surface of the structural member intermediate of the end faces, and tap into the contained electrical wiring to make electric power, telephone signals and other electrically transferred information avail able at the desk.
