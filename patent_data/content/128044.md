# Fiber optic connector having dual supporting surfaces and method of terminating fiber optic transmission members.

## Abstract
A fiber optic connector comprises a housing member 58 , ferrule members 10 and a coupling member 72 . The housing member 58 is rigid and has a profiled bore 56 extending therethrough which has a central cylindrical sur face 60 , tapered surfaces 62 on each side of the central cylindrical surface 60 , and a support surface 64 at the outer end of each tapered surface 62 . The ferrule members 10 are of resilient deformable material and are terminated onto fiber optic transmission members. Each ferrule member 10 has a profiled front end comprising a front cylindrical section 20 of slightly larger diameter than the central cylindrical surface 60 , a tapered section 22 slightly smaller than the bore tapered surfaces 62 , and an alignment section 24 for tight engagement with the support surfaces 64 when the ferrule members 10 are urged together by coupling member 72 thereby applying a radial compressive force to the front cylin drical sections 20 and axially aligning the fiber optic trans mission members 14 and the alignment sections of the fer rule members 10 tightly engaging the support surfaces 64 of the housing member 58 to maintain the ferrule members 10 in alignment when lateral forces are applied to the ferrule members 10 . A reservoir for index matching fluid is formed peripherally around the engaged front surfaces 35 by peripheral surfaces 52 . A ferrule member 10 may be formed with a domed front surface 34 which is polished to a flat front surface 35 after terminating an end of a fiber optic transmission member 14 therein.
