# Nuclear magnetic resonance methods.

## Abstract
This invention provides improved methods of investigat ing a body by nuclear magnetic resonance wherein nuclear magnetic resonance is preferentially excited in a slice of the body and the resulting free induction decay signals are detected in the presence of a magnetic field having first and second gradients G In one proposed method two experiments are per formed in which the phase of the first gradient G In a second proposed method the second gradient G In a third proposed method, the first gradient G
