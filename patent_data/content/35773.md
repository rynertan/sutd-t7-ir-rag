# SUBSTITUTED OXIMES, PROCESS FOR PREPARING THEM AND DUPLICATING AND MARKING SYSTEMS

## Abstract
Aldehyde or ketone 0 3 indolyl aryl or heteroaryl methyl oximes which are useful as color formers in pressure sensitive carbonless duplicating systems and ther mal marking systems are prepared by reacting 3 arylsulfonyl aryl or heteroaryl methyl 1H indoles with aldehyde or ketone oximes in the presence of a base.
