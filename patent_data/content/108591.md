# Improvements in disc brakes for vehicles.

## Abstract
In a spreading disc brake, actuating movement of an actautor assembly 9 in a stationary housing 1 can be effected hydraulically by a piston 33 working in a cylinder 31 and acting on a pull rod 20 through a rocking thrust coupling 39, 43 , and the pull rod 20 is adapted for connection to a hand lever in order to apply the brake manually or mechanically. The thrust coupling 39, 43 is provided at an intermediate point in the length of a lever 41 , a first pivotal connection 44 is provided between the pull rod 20 and an intermediate point in the length of the lever 41 , a second pivotal connection 45 is provided between one end of the lever 41 and the housing 1 , and a third pivotal connection 46 is provided between the oppo site end of the level 41 and a transmission member 52 for connection to the hand lever.
