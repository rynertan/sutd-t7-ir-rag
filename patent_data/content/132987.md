## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO DEESTERIFICATION TO ACIDS Compounds such as the penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics and their nuclear analogs are complex organic molecules which generally posEess one or more functional groups. The synthesis of such compounds routinely requires the use of protecting groups for the functional groups that would enter into, if unprotected, unwanted side reactions leading to undesired products. The most common functional group present in compounds such as penicillins and cephalosporins is the carboxylic acid group. The typical method of protecting the carboxylic acid group during reactions is to convert it to an ester. Once the desired reaction has taken place elsewhere in the molecule, the ester must be converted back to the carboxylic acid group, which generally is required for biological activity.Because compounds such as the penicillins and cephalosporins and their nuclear analogs are very sensitive to normal de esterification conditions such as strong acid or strong base, methods for de esterification must be very mild. In accordance with the invention, there is provided a de esterification process for esters of organic carboxylic acids that is unusually mild and efficient. In particular, the invention provides a process for preparing a compound of Formula I R1 COO I which comprises reacting a lower alkyl thiol and a Lewis acid with an ester of Formula it R1 COOR2 II in which R1is an organic moiety and R2 is an organic ester forming group capable of forming a stabilized carbonium ion. In a preferred embodiment, R2 is diphenylmethyl or 2,4,6 trimethylbenzyl. In another preferred embodiment, R1 is a penicillin, cephalosporin, carbapenicillin, carbacephalosporin, or oxacephalosporin nucleus moiety. The process provided by this invention is carried out by reacting an ester of a carboxylic acid with a lower alkyl thiol and a Lewis acid. By lower alkyl thiol is meant a compound such as methanethiol, ethanethiol, n propanethiol, n butanethiol and isohexanethiol. A preferred lower alkyl thiol is ethanethiol. The term Lewis acid carries its art recognized meaning of a substance that can take up an electron pair to form a convalent bond. Boron trifluoride is a widely recognized Lewis acid, and is a preferred Lewis acid of this invention. It generally is employed as the commercially available diethyl etherate complex. Other Lewis acids which may be used in the present process include stannic chloride, zinc chloride and the like. The de esterification process of this invention generally is performed by combining about equimclar quantities of an ester of a carboxylic acid, a Lewis acid and a lower alkyl thicl. If desired, a small excess, for instance about 0.01 to about 1.0 molar excess, of the Lewis acid and or the lower alkyl thiol may be employed to ensure complete de esterification of the ester. Further, if desired, the reaction may be carried out in an unreactive organic solvent.Solvents routinely employed include halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform, dichloromethane, 1,2dichloroethane aromatic solvents such as benzene, toluene, or xylene and ketones such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone. A preferred reaction solvent is a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane. The process of this invention generally is complete after about one half to about eight hours when carried out at a temperature of about 20 to about 500C. In a preferred embodiment, the process is conducted at about 20 to about 300C. Once the deesterification reaction is substantially complete, the carboxylic acid product readily can be isolated, if desired, by routine methods, for example by simply filtering the product or removing the reaction solvent.The product can be further purified, if needed, by standard extraction techniques, chromatography, crystallization, salt formation or other known purification techniques. The process of this invention is quite general and may be performed on any carboxylic acid ester in which the ester forming group is capable of forming a stabilized carbonium ion. Carbonium ions are well known intermediates in several kinds of organic reactions.Carbonium ions are organic species that carry a positive charge on a central carbon atom, and usually are very short lived. A stabilized carbonium ion is one that possesses a resonance or hyperconjugation energy greater than about 84 kcal mole, the resonance energy for the tert butyl carbonium ion. Typical ester forming groups which form stabilized carbonium ions and may be employed in the substrates for the present process include bulky alkyl groups such as tert butyl and diphenylmethyl alkylated benzyl groups such as 2,4,6 trimethylbenzyl and pentamethylbenzyl alkoxybenzyl groups such as p methoxybenzyl, and polycyclic methyl groups such as 9 anthrylmethyl. As noted above, the present de esterification process is quite general and can be carried out on esters in which R1 in the above formula is basically any organic group. The mildness of the process makes it particularly applicable to sensitive compounds such as penicillins and cephalosporins and their nuclear analogs. In a preferred embodiment, R1 in the above formula is a penicillin moiety of Formula III EMI4.1 or a cephalosporin moiety of Formula IV EMI5.1 in which R3 is an acyl residue, R4 is hydrogen, alkoxy or aikylthio, X is S, O, or CH2, and R5 is hydrogen, halogen, or an organic group commonly found in cephalosporin compounds.Typical R5 groups include methyl, chloro and acetoxymethyl, however, a wide variety of other pharmaceutically acceptable groups are known and may be employed. The nature of the group defined in the above formula by R1is not critical to the process of this invention because the process operates only on the carboxylic acid ester moiety. If a carboxylic acid ester group such as a diphenylmethyl ester or the like is located at another site in the molecule, for instance as part of the R3 group, some de esterification at that ester group will occur also. If desired, any carboxylic acid groups occurring as part of the R3 or R5 group can be protected with an ester forming group that will not form a stabilized carbonium ion, for instance the 2,2,2 trichloroethyl group or the para nitrobenzyl group. Such esters are not affected by the process of this invention. Exemplary of the organic carboxylic acid esters which may be de esterified by the process of this invention are the diphenylmethyl esters of amino acids such as glycine, alpine, leucine, threonine, asparagine, glutamine, lysine, arginine, tyrosine, tryptophan, proline, and other amino acids useful in the synthesis of peptides and the like. Typical penicillin esters that may serve as substrates in the present process include the diphenylmethyl, 2,4,6 trimethylbenzyl, 4 methoxybenzyl and tert butyl esters of penicillin V, penicillin G, penicillin K, and similar penicillins in which R3 in the above formula is methoxybenzylcarbonyl, benzyloxybenzylcarbonyl, methylenedioxybenzylcarbonyl, a methoxycarbonylbenzylcarbonyl, thienylacetyl, oxazolylacetyl, naphthyloxyacetyl, or benzothiazolyloxyacetyl. Exemplary of the carbapenams and carbapenems which may be employed as substrates in the present process are the diphenylmethyl esters of thienamycin and related compounds carbapenams in which X in the above formula is CH2 and R3 is phenylacetyl, phenoxyacetyl, a aminophenylacetyl1 a hydroxyphenylacetyl, furylacetyl, thiazolylacetyl, tetrazolylacetyl, thiecylpropionyl, and the like. Typical cephaiosporins which may be employed as substrates include the diphenylmethyl and 4 methoxybenzyl esters of cephalosporin C, cephalexin, cephradine, cefadroxil, cefatrizine, cefaclor, cephalothin, cephapirin, cefacetrile, cephaloridine, cefsulodin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefuroxime, cefoxitin, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftezole, and other related cephalosporin esters. Diphenylmethyl and 2, 4, 6 methylbenzyl esters of carbacephalosporins and l oxodethicephalo sporins such as moxalactam also can b used. Typi cal of such substrates are those of Formula IV in which X is CH2 or 0 and R3 is lower alkanoyl, lower alkoxycarbonyl, cycloalkanecarbonyl, aroyl such as benzoyl, toluoylyl and xyloyl, and groups such as phenylacetyl, phenoxyacetyl, thiazolylacetyl, thienylpropionyl, a arnino pherylacetyl, and other related groups. It is to be understood that the present ester cleavage process is general and operates equally well on any ester of a carboxylic acid, in which the ester forming group is capable of forming a stabilized carbonium ion. The foregoing list of exemplary substrates is illustrative only and is not intended to be limiting in any respect. The following non limiting examples are provided to further illustrate the invention.
