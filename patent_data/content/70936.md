# A base lock type font holder for imprinting apparatus.

## Abstract
A type font holder for imprinting apparatus comprising selectively spreadable aligned parallel rows of base lock type font holding segments clampled together within the outwardly opening cavity of a carrier body with the type font seated therein. An internally spring biased ratchet like arrangement facilitates both clamping and retention of the type font therein immovably during as many as several million impacts. The ratchet like arrangement includes a pair of free mounted miniature puck members seated at opposite ends of a coil spring, together seated in bearing relation to clamping screws employed to secure the segments within the cavity. The clamping screws are manually manipulated against the spring bias to spread or to clamp said segments.
