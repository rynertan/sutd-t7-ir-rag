# Photographic color developer solutions.

## Abstract
A poly alkyleneimine , such as poly ethyleneimine , in a photographic color developer solution containing a primary aromatic amino color developing agent protects the develop ing agent against aerial oxidation. The poly alkyleneimine also functions to reduce tar formation and retard stain growth and provides a supplemental source of alkalinity in the color developer solution.
