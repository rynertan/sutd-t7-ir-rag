# PULSED LIGHT SELECTIVE PHOTOLYSIS PROCESS FOR TREATMENT OF BIOLOGICAL MEDIA AND PRODUCTS MADE THEREBY

## Abstract
A novel irradiation process and products made thereby are disclosed. Biological media such as blood, blood frac tions, genetically engineered protein products and vaccine preparations are treated by said process, photolyzing nucleic acids in preference to proteins in said media. E.g., DNA or RNA containing pathogens are inactivated while leaving the proteins substantially intact or functional. In general, the process comprises irradiating the medium with pulsed light of wavelength and flux selected so that 1 the nucleic acids in their ground state absorb radiation and thereby rise to an excited state or states, 2 the nucleic acids in their excited states absorb radiation and thereby rise to higher energy states and undergo photolysis, and 3 the proteins in their ground or their excited states do not absorb sufficient radiation to undergo substantial photolysis. It is surprising and unexpected that nucleic acids in their excited states undergo efficient photolysis whereas proteins under the same conditions in the same medium are kept substantially intact.
