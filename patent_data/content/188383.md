## Description
The present invention relates to a series of new imidazole derivatives which are useful in the treatment of disorders arising from an imbalance in the metabolic levels of the prostaglandin derivative, thromboxane A₂ hereinafter simply referred to as TXA₂ . The invention also provides processes for producing such imidazole derivatives. Many of the compounds within the group known generally as prostaglandins are known to have extremely important effects on the metabolism and functioning of the animal, including human, body, although, in most cases, the mode and often precise effect or effects of the individual compounds have not yet been elucidated. It is known that TXA₂ has a fundamental role in inducing platelet aggregation and constricting the smooth muscles of the arteries and it is known that this compound is produced from prostaglandin endoperoxide PGH₂ Needleman We have now discovered a series of novel imidazole derivatives which have a very powerful inhibitory effect on the synthesis of TXA₂ and thus have a very pronounced therapeutic activity. The activities of the compounds of the invention are significantly in some cases by an order of magnitude better than those of the prior art compounds. The compounds of the present invention are those compounds of formula I wherein In particular, we prefer that R², R⁴, R⁵ and R⁶ should not simultaneously be selected from hydrogen atoms and unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl groups. The invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an active compound in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent, wherein the active compound is at least one compound of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable ester, amide or salt thereof. The compounds of the invention may be used for the treatment or prophylaxis of diseases and disorders arising from an imbalance in the level of TXA₂ in an animal, normally mammal, including human being, by administering an effective amount of the compound of the invention to said animal by any convenient route, e.g. oral or parenteral.

Where R², R⁴, R⁵ or R⁶ represents a C₂ C₆ alkenyl group, this may be a straight or branched chain group and is more preferably a C₂ C₄ alkenyl group, for example a vinyl, allyl, isopropenyl or 2 butenyl group.

Such a group may be unsubstituted or may have at least one substituent selected from the groups defined above as substituents a other than said aryl groups and b . Where R² or substituent a is an aromatic heterocyclic group having from 5 to 14, more preferably from 5 to 8 and most preferably 5 or 6, ring atoms, of which from 1 to 5, preferably from 1 to 3 and more preferably 1 or 2, are nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur hetero atoms, such groups may be unsubstituted or may have at least one substituent selected from the groups defined above as substituents a other than said heterocyclic groups and b .

Where X, Y, Z or substituent a or c represents a C₁ C₆ alkoxy group, this may be a straight or branched chain group and is preferably a C₁ C₄ group. Examples of such groups include the methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy and isobutoxy groups. Where X, Y or Z represents a C₁ C₆ alkanoyloxy group, this likewise may be a straight or branched chain group and is preferably a C₂ C₄ alkanoyloxy group, for example an acetoxy, propionyloxy, butyryloxy or isobutyryloxy group.

Where X, Y, Z or substituent a represents a C₁ C₆ alkylsulphinyl group or a C₁ C₆ alkylsulphonyl group, each alkyl part is a C₁ C₆ alkyl group, such as those exemplified above in relation to R², more preferably a C₁ C₄ and most preferably a C₁ C₂, group, and examples of such alkylsulphinyl and alkylsulphonyl groups include the methanesulphinyl, methanesulphonyl, ethanesulphinyl, ethanesulphonyl, propanesulphinyl and propanesulphonyl groups. Where substituent a represents a carboxylic acyloxy group, this is preferably a C₁ C₆ alkanoyloxy group, e.g. those exemplified above in relation to X, Y and Z, or an arylcarbonyl group, in which the aryl part is preferably as defined above in relation to the aryl groups which may be represented by R². Specific examples of such acyloxy groups include the acetoxy, propionyloxy, butyryloxy, isobutyryloxy, benzoyloxy, Where R² represents an alkyl group having an aryl substituent, i.e. an aralkyl group, the aryl part is preferably as defined above in relation to the aryl groups which may be represented by R², whilst the alkyl group is most preferably a C₁ C₃ alkyl group and examples of such aralkyl groups thus include the benzyl, phenethyl, α methylbenzyl, 3 phenylpropyl, α naphthylmethyl, 2 α naphthyl ethyl and 2 β naphthyl ethyl groups.

Where R² represents an alkyl group having a cycloalkyl substituent, the cycloalkyl part is preferably as defined above in relation to the cycloalkyl groups which may be represented by R² and is more preferably a C₃ C₆ cycloalkyl group, whilst the alkyl part is preferably a C₁ C₃ alkyl group. Examples of such groups include the cyclopropylmethyl, cyclobutylmethyl, cyclopentylmethyl, 2 cyclopentylethyl, 3 cyclopentylpropyl, cyclohexylmethyl, 2 cyclohexylethyl and 3 cyclohexylpropyl groups. Where R² represents an alkyl group having an aromatic heterocyclic substituent, the heterocyclic part is preferably as defined above in relation to R², respectively, whilst the alkyl part is preferably a C₁ C₃, more preferably C₁ or C₂, alkyl group. Where any of the groups referred to above are substituted, there is, in principle, no restriction in accordance with the present invention as to the number of substituents which may be possible. Accordingly, the present invention, in referring to substituted groups, envisages such groups containing anything from a single substituent to complete substitution of all substitutable positions. However, in practice, as is well known in the art, there may be practical limitations as to the number of possible substituents, arising from steric constraints. For example, where the substituent is relatively small , for example a halogen atom, complete substitution i.e. perhalogenation may be possible. On the other hand, if the substituent is relatively bulky and the group to be substituted is relatively small, then steric constraints may limit the number of substituents, possibly even to a single substituent only. These factors are, however, well known to all chemists. In general, where substituents are referred to, we would normally first consider from 1 to 3 such substituents, but it will be appreciated that, given the constraints described above, more substituents may be possible. Preferred classes of compound of the present invention are compounds of formula I in which The compounds of the invention necessarily contain a carboxy group at the 4 position of the benzene ring, which may form esters, amides and salts. Where the carboxy group on the benzene ring is esterified, the nature of the resulting ester is not critical to the present invention. In principle, the compounds of the invention, being carboxylic acids, will form esters with any ester forming alcohol and all such esters form part of the present invention. However, where the esters are to be employed for therapeutic purposes, it is, of course, necessary that the resulting esters should be pharmaceutically acceptable, which, as is understood in the art, means that the esters should not have reduced activity, or substantially reduced activity, and should not have increased toxicity, or substantially increased toxicity, as compared with the free acid. However, where the ester is to be employed for other purposes, for example as an intermediate in the preparation of other compounds, even this criterion does not apply. Accordingly, the esters are C₁ C₆, and preferably C₁ C₄ alkyl esters, for example the methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec butyl, t butyl, pentyl and hexyl esters aralkyl and diarylalkyl esters, such as the benzyl, Likewise, where the carboxy group has formed an amide, the precise nature of the amide is not critical, provided that, where the amide is to be used for therapeutic purposes, the resulting amide is pharmaceutically acceptable. Accordingly, the carboxy group can be replaced by a carbamoyl group or an an alkylcarbamoyl or dialkylcarbamoyl group in which each alkyl part is a C₁ C₄ alkyl group, preferably selected amongst those alkyl groups listed above in relation to R², and, in the case of the di substituted groups, the two alkyl groups may be the same or different. Specific examples of such groups include the methylcarbamoyl, ethylcarbamoyl, propylcarbamoyl, isopropylcarbamoyl, butylcarbamoyl, isobutylcarbamoyl, dimethylcarbamoyl, diethylcarbamoyl, dipropylcarbamoyl, diisopropylcarbamoyl, dibutylcarbamoyl, methylcarbamoyloxy, ethylcarbamoyloxy, propylcarbamoyloxy, isopropylcarbamoyloxy, butylcarbamoyloxy, isobutylcarbamoyloxy, dimethylcarbamoyloxy, diethylcarbamoyloxy, dipropylcarbamoyloxy, diisopropylcarbamoyloxy and dibutylcarbamoyloxy groups, especially a methylcarbamoyl, ethylcarbamoyl, dimethylcarbamoyl or diethylcarbamoyl group. The carboxy group may also form salts with appropriate bases. Additionally, since the imidazole nitrogen atoms are basic in character, the compounds of the invention also form acid addition salts. The nature of such salts is likewise not critical, provided that, where they are to be used for therapeutic purposes, the salts are pharmaceutically acceptable. A wide range of acids can form acid addition salts with the compounds of the invention and examples of such acids include mineral acids, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid organic carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, asparaginic acid, glutamic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, malonic acid and succinic acid and organic sulphonic acids, such as methanesulphonic acid, benzenesulphonic acid and Examples of salts with bases include salts with metals, especially alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, such as the lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium salts the ammonium salt salts with organic amines, such as cyclohexylamine, diisopropylamine or triethylamine and salts with basic amino acids, such as lysine or arginine. The compounds of the invention contain at least one and may contain several asymmetric carbon atoms and, accordingly, optical isomers of the compounds are possible. Although the various optical isomers are all represented herein by a single formula, the present invention embraces both the individual isolated isomers and mixtures thereof. Examples of specific compounds of the invention are given in the following Tables 1 to 3. The compounds of the invention are hereinafter, where appropriate, identified by the numbers appended to them in these Tables. The numbers are not consecutive, owing to deletions. In the Tables, the following abbreviations are used are as defined in Table 1 are as defined in Table 2 are as defined in Table 3 Of the compounds listed above, the preferred compounds are Compounds No. 40, 44, 49, 58, 62, 66, 70, 74, 79, 84, 93, 115, 162 and 165, as well as their hydrochlorides and sodium salts. The compounds of the present invention may be prepared by the processes described below. In this process, a 2 imidazolylethyl derivative of formula II is reacted with a phenyl mercaptan of formula III to give a compound of formula Ia and then this is, if desired, oxidized to give a corresponding sulphinyl or sulphonyl compound of formula Ib , as illustrated by the following reaction scheme In the above formulae, R¹, R², R⁴, R⁵, R⁶, X, Y and Z are all as defined above. R³ represents a carboxy group or an esterified, amidified or salified carboxy group. The nature of the group represented by W is not critical in the present invention and any group which can be readily replaced by the thio group derived from the compound of formula III can be employed. Examples of suitable leaving groups include the hydroxy group halogen atoms, for example the chlorine, bromine or iodine atoms C₁ C₄, and especially C₁ and C₂, alkanesulphonyloxy groups, such as the methanesulphonyloxy and ethanesulphonyloxy groups trihalomethanesulphonyloxy groups, e.g. the trifluoromethanesulphonyloxy group and arylsulphonyloxy groups, e.g. the benzenesulphonyloxy or In step A1 of this reaction, the 2 imidazolylethyl derivative of formula II is reacted with the phenyl mercaptan of formula III or with a salt thereof, to give the desired compound of formula Ia . This reaction is preferably effected in the presence of a solvent, the nature of which is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect upon the reaction. Suitable solvents include halogenated hydrocarbons, especially halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as chloroform, methylene chloride or 1,2 dichloroethane ketones, such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone ethers, such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene or toluene esters, such as ethyl formate or ethyl acetate alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol amides, such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide dimethyl sulphoxide nitromethane a mixture of any two or more of the above organic solvents or a mixture of any one of more of the above organic solvents with water. The reaction is preferably effected in the presence of an acid binding agent, particularly where W represents a halogen atom or a sulphonyloxy group. The function of the acid binding agent is to remove from the reaction the acid liberated by the condensation and, accordingly, any basic compound which will serve this function may be employed. Suitable bases include amines, such as triethylamine, pyridine, 2,6 lutidine, or dimethylaniline alkali metal bicarbonates, such as sodium bicarbonate alkali metal and alkaline earth metal carbonates, such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate or calcium carbonate and alkali metal hydroxides, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. We find it particularly convenient first to convert the phenyl mercaptan III to its salt with an alkali or alkaline earth metal or with an organic base before reaction with the imidazolylethyl compound of formula II . Where W represents a hydroxy group, the reaction may also be effected in the presence of a suitable acidic compound, for example a mineral acid, such as sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid an organic carboxylic or sulphonic acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid, acetic acid or The reaction involved in step A1 will take place over a wide range of temperatures and the temperature employed is not particularly critical. However, in order to suppress side reactions, it is desirable that the temperature should not be too high and, accordingly, a temperature of from 10 C to 100 C is normally preferred. The time required for the reaction will vary widely, depending upon many factors, including the nature of the starting materials and the reaction temperature, but a period of from 20 minutes to 100 hours will normally suffice. In step A2, if desired, the thio compound of formula Ia is converted to the corresponding The oxidation reaction is preferably effected in the presence of an inert solvent using any conventional oxidizing agent. There is no particular limitation to be imposed on the choice of oxidizing agent, provided that it is capable of oxidizing thio compounds to sulphinyl and or sulphonyl compounds, without affecting the remainder of the molecule. Suitable oxidizing agents are the organic peracids, particularly The solvent to be employed is likewise not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect on the reaction. Examples of suitable solvents include halogenated hydrocarbons, particularly halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride or chloroform ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane organic acids, such as acetic acid or a mixture of one or more such organic solvents with water. Although the reaction temperature is not particularly critical, a relatively low temperature is generally preferred, in order to avoid undesirable side reactions, and we therefore normally prefer a temperature within the range from 0 C to room temperature. The time required for the reaction will vary widely depending upon many factors, notably the reaction temperature and the nature of the starting material, but a period of from 20 minutes to 50 hours will normally suffice. If the compound of formula Ia contains an alkylthio group i.e. if substituent a , X, Y or Z represents an alkylthio group , then this may simultaneously be oxidized to the corresponding alkylsulphinyl or alkylsulphonyl group. Step A2 of this reaction sequence may be carried out with or without intermediate isolation of the product of step A1, the thio compound of formula Ia . After either or both of steps A1 and A2, the product of the reaction may be isolated from the reaction mixture by conventional means. For example, one suitable recovery sequence, which may be employed for either step, comprises adding a water immiscible organic solvent to the reaction mixture separating the organic phase, containing the desired compound, from the mixture if necessary, washing the separated organic phase with water and then distilling off the solvent, to give the desired product of formula Ia or Ib . This product may, if necessary, be further purified by conventional means, for example recrystallization, reprecipitation or the various chromatography techniques, particularly column chromatography or preparative thin layer chormatography. In this process, imidazole or an imidazole derivative of formula IV is reacted with a 2 phenylthioethyl derivative of formula V , to give a compound of formula Ic , and then this is, if necessary, oxidized to give a compound of formula Id , as illustrated in the following reaction scheme In the above formulae, R¹, R³, X, Y, Z and In step B1 of this reaction, the imidazole or derivative thereof of formula IV or an alkali metal salt thereof is reacted with the 2 phenylthioethyl derivative of formula V to give the compound of formula Ic . If it is desired that the imidazole compound of formula IV should be used in the form of an alkali metal salt, then the imidazole is first reacted with an alkali metal hydride, e.g. sodium hydride or potassium hydride in a suitable inert solvent. The reaction of the imidazole compound IV or its salt with the phenylthioethyl compound V is preferably effected in the presence of a solvent. The nature of the solvent is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect on the reaction. Suitable solvents include, for example ethers, such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene or toluene halogenated hydrocarbons, particularly halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride, chloroform or 1,2 dichloroethane amides, such as hexamethylphosphoric triamide, dimethylacetamide or dimethylformamide alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol ketones, such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone nitriles, such as acetonitrile esters, such as ethyl formate or ethyl acetate dimethyl sulphoxide nitromethane and mixtures of any two or more of these organic solvents. The reaction temperature is not particularly critical and the reaction of step B1 will take place over a wide range of temperatures. However, in order to suppress side reactions, it is desirable that the temperature should not be too high and, accordingly, a temperature within the range from 10 C to 100 C is normally preferred. The time required for the reaction will vary widely, depending upon many factors, notably the reaction temperature and the nature of the starting materials, but a period of from 20 minutes to 100 hours will normally suffice. If desired, the resulting product of formula Ic may then be subjected to step B2, which is an oxidation step identical with step A2, and which may be carried out employing the same reagents and under the same reaction conditions. After either or both of steps B1 and B2, the desired product may be separated from the reaction mixture by conventional means. For example, one suitable recovery technique comprises adding a water immiscible organic solvent to the reaction mixture separating the organic phase and, if necessary, washing it with water and distilling off the solvent to leave the desired product the compound of formula Ic or Id . This may, if necessary, be further purified by conventional means, for example recrystallization, reprecipitation or the various chromatography techniques, such as column chromatography or preparative thin layer chromatography. If R², substituent a or R³ in the resulting compound of formula Ia , Ib , Ic or Id represents an esterified carboxy group, this may, if desired, be de esterified, to give a free carboxy group, by known means. For example, if it is a straight chain alkyl ester, such as a methyl or ethyl ester, the alkyl group may be removed by alkaline hydrolysis. If it is a t butyl ester, the t butyl group may be removed by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid. If it is an aralkyl ester such as a benzyl or After completion of this reaction, the resulting carboxylic acid can, if desired, be separated from the reaction mixture by conventional means. For example, one suitable recovery technique comprises if necessary, filtering off any insoluble substances washing the organic solvent layer with water and then drying it and distilling off the solvent to give the desired compound. This can, if required, be further purified by conventional means, for example recrystallization or the various chromatography techniques, such as preparative thin layer chromatography or column chromatography. Where R², substituent a or R³ represents a carboxy or esterified carboxy group, this can be converted into another esterified carboxy group or into a carbamoyl or Similarly, the compounds of the invention can be converted to their pharmaceutically acceptable salts by treatment with an acid or a base, as is well known in the art. The compounds of the present invention have been found, as demonstrated hereafter, to inhibit the activity of TXA₂ synthetase, as a result of which they have an antithrombotic activity, as also demonstrated hereafter. The platelet microsome fraction was separated from rabbit and from human blood by the method of Needleman The microsomal TXA₂ synthetase activity in the presence of various of the compounds of the invention at various concentrations was assayed by a modification of the method of Kayama In addition to the compounds of the invention, we also tested the activity of the known compound Dazoxiben, whose systematic name is 4 2 1 imidazolyl ethoxy benzoic acid hydrochloride, and which is disclosed in GB Patent Specification No. 2,038,821. The compounds of the invention are identified in the following Tables by the numbers heretofore assigned to them. All compounds were employed in the form of the hydrochloride, except Compound No. 40, which was employed as the free base. The results using rabbit platelet microsomes are given in Table 4, whilst the results using human platelet microsomes are given in Table 5. As can be seen from the results given above, the compounds of the invention show a significantly greater activity than does the known compound Dazoxiben and, in particular, as shown in Table 5, the activity of the compounds of the invention against thromboxane synthetase derived from human platelet microsomes is about 10 times higher than the activity of Dazoxiben. This test was carried out by a modification of the method of Silver Each group of rabbits was administered orally the test compound at an appropriate dose and then, one hour after the oral administration, each was given 1.3 mg kg of arachidonic acid by intravenous injection. The test animals were observed and sudden deaths during the test period were recorded. The ED₅₀ was determined by Probit s method. Unmedicated rabbits were employed as a control, without administering any test compound, but these were all dead within several minutes after the injection of arachidonic acid, as a result of pulmonary thromboembolisms. The results, in terms of the ED₅₀, are given in the following Table 6. The results given above indicate an activity about 10 times higher than that of the known compound Dazoxiben. The results given above demonstrate that the compounds of the invention inhibit thromboxane synthetase of the blood platelet microsomes of mammals, including humans, and that they further exhibit strong and specific inhibitory activities against the biosynthesis of TXA₂. Specifically, the biosynthesis of TXA₂ may be inhibited to the extent of 50 by a concentration of the compound of the order of 10 ⁸ molar. However, the compounds of the invention have very weak inhibitory activities against cyclooxigenase and against prostacyclin synthetase and thus do not inhibit the synthesis of other prostaglandin derivatives. Also, we have demonstrated in Accordingly, the compounds of the present invention are expected to be valuable for the therapy and prophylaxis of diseases and disorders caused by an imbalance in the blood level of TXA₂, for example inflammation, hypertension, thrombosis, cerebral haemorrhages and asthma, and are expected to be especially useful in the treatment or prophylaxis of thromboembolisms in mammals, including humans. For example, they are expected to be useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular thrombosis and ischaemic peripheral blood vessel diseases, as well as in the treatment and prophylaxis of postoperative thrombosis and to accelerate the dilation of transplanted blood vessels after an operation. The compounds of the invention may be administered by any suitable route, oral or parenteral, and may be formulated accordingly, for example for oral administration as tablets, capsules, powders or syrups or, for parenteral administration, as suppositories or as injectible solutions or suspensions for subcutaneous or intravenous injection. The compounds of the invention may be formulated with conventional pharmaceutical carriers or diluents or may be administered as such. The amount of the compound of the invention to be administered will vary, depending upon the nature and severity of the disease or disorder to be treated, the age, bodyweight, symptoms and condition of the patient and the mode of administration. However, by way of guidance, the dose for an adult human being would be expected to be from 50 to 1800 mg per day, which is preferably administered in divided doses, e.g. about 3 times per day. The preparation of certain compounds of the invention is further illustrated by the following Examples. 1.5 g of methyl 4 mercaptobenzoate was dissolved in 8 ml of dry dimethylformamide, and the resulting solution was added to 388 mg of a 55 w w suspension of sodium hydride in mineral oil, whilst ice cooling and then the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes.
