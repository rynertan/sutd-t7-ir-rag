# LOUVER CONSTRUCTION FOR SUPPORTING A CHARGE OF PARTICULATE MATERIAL

## Abstract
A louver construction arranged in a closed vessel formed with an inlet port and an outlet port for parti culate material aligned in a vertical direction and an inlet port and an outlet port for gas having its compo nents adsorbed on the particulate material aligned in a horizontal direction. In addition to a plurality of sets of main louver elements oriented in the direction of flow of the particulate material and spaced apart from one another a predetermined distance with the main louver elements of each set angling toward each other a predetermined amount with respect to the direction of flow of the gas, at least one other set of louver el ements is arranged in such a manner that the louver elements angling a predetermined amount toward each other with respect to the direction of flow of the gas are each interposed between the main louver elements of the adjacent sets.
