## Description
Title SELF TRIMMING PHOTOSENSITIVE LAYER Technical Field The invention relates to a photosensitive layer and particularly to a photosensitive layer which is self trimming when it is laminated to a substrate. Background of the Invention and Discussion of the Prior Art U.S. Patent 4,075,051 discloses a process for self t rimming of a photoresist layer laminated to a substrate, i.e., the portion of the layer extending past the edges of the substrate is removed without any cutting step. This is accomplished by applying a liquid weakening agent at least to the aforesaid portion of the layer, but possibly to the entire layer by pre wetting of the substrate with the agent, and then peeling away a support film or auxiliary permeable sheet which has a greater adhesion to the layer than the cohesive strength as a result of the weakening agent of the layer.The accuracy of this self trimming, i.e., the coincidence of the trimmed layer with the edges of the substrate and the smoothness of the trimmed edges of the layer depends on the weakening effect of the particular liquid agent used and its amount. When the liquid agent has only minimal effect on the layer and is used in only a small amount, the ability to do accurate self trimming suffers accordingly. Furthermore, liquid agents which weaken the resist are also likely to weaken other functional properties of the photosensitive layer, e.g., tenting strength and resistance to plating conditions. Brief Description of the Invention The invention is therefore directed to a photopolymerizable layer which, when applied to a substrate, is trimmable with accurate coincidence and smoothness along the edges of the substrate. In particular, the invention is directed to such a photosensitive layer which is self trimming by the mere application of a tensile stress transverse to the edge of the substrate. The photosensitive layer comprises a addition polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomer b an intiator system activatable by actinic radiation and c a binder comprising a continuous major phase of organic polymer compatible with a and b and a discontinuous minor phase of randomly dispersed nonfibrous solid particles having a particle size of 0.1 to 25 microns.The concentration of the particles is adjusted so that the elongation at break of the layer is between about 2 and about 50 . Brief Description of the Drawing The advantages of the invention and the details of the manner in which it can be used will be apparent by reference to the drawing which consists of a single figure illustrating schematically a preferred way of utilizing the invention in a continuous process. Detailed Description of the Invention The above described invention involves the discovery that the incorporation of a discontinuous phase of certain kinds of solid particles in a continuous phase of binder results in a photosensitive composition which, when formed as a thin layer, is easily trimmed at the edge of a substrate merely by the application of a tensile stress to the layer transversely to the edge of the substrate. A wide variety of particulate materials may be used in the invention such as glass, polyethylene, polypropylene, talc, alumina, bentonite, koalinate, titanium dioxide, polytetrafluroethylene,Fischer Tropsch wax, animony trioxide, and aluminum chloride trihydrate. However, though the compositional variety of such materials is quite extensive they must nevertheless possess certain properties to be useful in the photosensitive layers of the invention. Firstly, the size of the particulate materials must not be greater than the thickness of the film in which they are used and preferably should be less in order that they not interfere with adhesion of the layer to the substrate. The size of the particles is preferably from 0.1 to 30 microns and not more than about 15 microns when they are used in 1 mil layers. Secondly, the particles must be nonfibrous in character so that they do not reinforce or strengthen the binder. Thirdly, the particles must be almost completely essentially insoluble in the other components of the photosensitive layer monomer, binder and initator so that they in fact form a discontinuous dispersion. Finally, the particles must be inert with respect to the other components of the photosensitive layer. Beyond the above described primary characteristics of the particles when they are formulated the resultant photosensitive layer must 1 possess an elongation at break of at least about 2 and 2 constitute less than 50 and preferably less than 30 , by weight, of the photosensitive layer. As used herein the term elongation at break refers to the percent of elongation when the layer is broken by the application of a tensile stress of 1 inch 2.54 cm per minute using an Instrons ModelTPB Tester. An elongation at break below about 2 is to be avoided because the layer may lack sufficient flexibility. A very satisfactory range of elongation at break is from about 5 to about 50 . It is preferred not to use solids which are opaque or highly colored in order to avoid interference with image resolution by light scattering and with photospeed by absorbing light. The particle size, shape and uniformity affect the suitability of use of any particular material in the invention. For example, some materials in concentrations which are capable of yielding suitable elongation at break may result in too high an optical density and thus they are unsuitable for use in that particular binder system.A particular material may meet all of the four particle criteria listed above and yet be unsuitable in a given photosensitive layer system. On the other hand, a change of binder may render the same particulate material suitable. Thus, even though the particulate materials may not be characterized in any single generic manner they are readily ascertained by simple experimentation. Because the above described particles are being used in photosensitive layers it is preferred that they be fairly uniform as to size distribution so that image resolution of the layer is maximized.For the same reason it is preferred that the particles be at least translucent and still more preferably transparent in order that appropriate image resolution can be achieved at higher particulate concentrations. Notwithstanding such translucency and uniformity size, it is preferred that the photosensitive layer contain less than 30 by weight beads in order that image resolution will not be reduced excessively by light scattering and that undercutting of the image be minimized. It will also be preferred for many applications of the invention that the optical density of the formulated layer be below about 0.7, measured at a wavelength of 350 to 400nm. Especially preferred particulates are polyethylene and polypropylene beads and poly tetrafluoroethylene powder. In practicing the invention, photosensitive film resist elements of various types may be used.In general photohardenable, negative working elements are photopolymerizable elements of the type disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,469,982 and the photocrosslinkable elements of the type disclosed in U.S.Patent 3,526,504. Positive working, resist elements may be of the photosolubilizable type, e.g., such as the o quinone diazide elements of U.S. Patent 3,837,860, or of the photodesensitizable type, e.g., such as the bisdiazonium salts of U.S.Patent 3,778,270 or the nitroaromatic compositions ofU.K. Patent 1,547,548. An element containing an image yielding photopolymerizable stratum on a strippable support is preferably used. The remaining surface of the supported, photopolymerizable stratum may be protected by a removable cover sheet or when the element is stored in roll form, the stratum surface may be protected by the contiguous reverse surface of the support. The photopolymerizable composition is present in a dry coating thickness of about 0.0003 inch 0.0008 cm to about 0.01 inch 60.025 cm or more.A suitable strippable support which preferably has a high degree of dimensional stability to temperature changes, may be chosen from a wide variety of films composed of high polymers, e.g., polyamides, polyolefins, polyesters, vinyl polymers, and cellulose esters, and may have a thickness of from 0.00025 inch X0.0006 cm to 0.008 inch 0.02 cm or more. If exposure is to be made before removing the strippable support, it must, of course, transmit a substantial fraction of the actinic radiation incident upon it. If the strippable support is removed prior to exposure, no such restrictions apply. A particularly suitable support is a transparent polyethylene terephthalate film having a thickness of about 0.001 inch 0.0025 cm . When the element contains no removable, protective cover sheet and is to be stored in roll form, the reverse side of the strippable support preferably has applied thereto a thin release layer of a material, such as wax or silicone, to prevent blocking with the photopolymerizable stratum.Alternatively, adhesion to the coated photopolymerizable layer may be preferentially increased by flame treating or electrical discharge treating the support surface to be coated. Suitable removable, protective cover sheets when used may be chosen from the same group of high polymer films described above and may have the same wide range of thicknesses. A cover sheet of 0.001 inch X0.0025 cm thick polyethylene is especially suitable. Supports and cover sheets as described above provide good protection to the photopolymerizable resist layer. The photohardenable layer is prepared from polymeric components binders , monomeric components, initiators and inhibitors. Suitable binders which can be used as the sole binder or in combination with others include the following polyacrylate and alpha alkyl polyacrylate esters, e.g., polymethyl methacrylate and polyethyl methacrylate polyvinyl esters, e.g., polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl acetate acrylate, polyvinyl acetate methacrylate and hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers polystyrene polymers and copolymers, e.g., with maleic anhydride and esters vinylidene chloride copolymers, e.g., vinylidene chloride acrylonitrile vinylidene chloride methacrylate and vinylidene chloride vinyl acetate copolymers polyvinyl chloride and copolymers, e.g., polyvinyl chloride acetate saturated and unsaturated polyurethanes synthetic rubbers, e.g., butadiene acrylonitrile, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, methacrylate acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymers, 2 chlorobutadiene l ,3 polymers, chlorinated rubber, and styrene butadiene styrene, styrene isoprene styrene block copolymers high molecular weight polyethylene oxides of polyglycols having average molecular weights from about 4,000 to 1,000,000 epoxides, e.g., epoxides containing acrylate or methacrylate groups copolyesters, e.g., those prepared from the reaction product of a polymethylene glycol of the formula HO CH2 nOH, where n is a whole number 2 to 10 inclusive, and 1 hexahydroterephthalic, sebacic and terephthalic acids, 2 terephthalic, isophthalic and sebacic acids, 3 terephthalic and sebacic acids, 4 terephthalic and isophthalic acids, and 5 mixtures of copolyesters prepared from said glycols and i terephthalic, isophthalic and sebacic acids and ii terephthalic, isophthalic, sebacic and adipic acids nylons or polyamides, e.g.,N methoxymethyl polyhexamethylene adipamide cellulose esters, e.g., cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate succinate and cellulose acetate butyrate cellulose ethers, e.g., methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and benzyl cellulose polycarbonates polyvinyl acetal, e.g., polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl formal polyformaldehydes.

In addition to the ethylenically unsaturated monomers mentioned above, the photohardenable layer can also contain at least one of the following free radical initiated, chain propagating, addition polymerizable, ethylenically unsaturated compounds having a molecular weight of at least 300. Preferred monomers of this type are an alkylene or a polyalkylene glycol diacrylate prepared from an alkylene glycol of 2 to 15 carbons or a polyalkylene ether glycol of 1 to 10 ether linkages, and those disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,927,022, e.g., those having a plurality of addition polymerizable ethylenic linkages particularly when present as terminal linkages. Especially preferred are those wherein at least one and preferably most of such linkages are conjugated with a double bonded carbon, including carbon double bonded to carbon and to such herteroatoms as nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur.Outstanding are such materials wherein the ethylenically unsaturated groups, especially the vinylidene groups, are conjugated with ester or amide structures.

Photoreducible dyes and reducing agents disclosed in U.S. Patents 2,850,445 2,875,047 3,097,096 3,074,974 3,097,097 and 3,145,104 as well as dyes of the phenazine, oxazine, and quinone classes Michler s ketone, benzophenone, 2,4,5 triphenyl imidazolyl dimers with hydrogen donors, and mixtures thereof as described in U.S.Patents 3,427,161 3,479,185 and 3,549,367 can be used as initiators.

Also useful for thermal polymerization inhibition are the nitroso compositions disclosed inU.S. Patent 4,168,982. Various dyes and pigments may be added to increase the visibility of the resist image. Any colorant used, however, should preferably be transparent to the actinic radiation used. Generally, suitable substrates for the process of the invention involving printed circuit formation are those which have mechanical strength, chemical resistance and good dielectric properties.Thus, most board materials for printed circuits are thermosetting or thermoplastic resins usually combined with a reinforcing agent. Thermosetting resins with reinforcing fillers are ordinarily used for rigid boards, whereas thermoplastic resin without reinforcements are usually used for flexible circuit boards. The materials from which the board is made may, of course, influence the choice of liquid for the thin layer. Typical board construction involves combinations such as phenolic or epoxy resins on paper or a paper glass composite, as well as polyester, epoxy, polyimide, polytetrafluorethylene, or polystyrene on glass. In most instances, the board is clad with a thin layer of electroconductive metal of which copper is by far the most common. Suitable substrates for the process of the invention involving preparation of lithographic printing plates are those which have mechanical strength and surfaces which differ in hydrophilicity or oleophilicity from the surfaces of the imaged photosensitive areas laminated thereto. Such substrates are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,072,528.While numerous substrates are satisfactory for this purpose thin anodized aluminum plates such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,458,311 are particularly useful. It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that it will be preferable for the printed circuit substrate surface which is to be laminated to be clean and free of any extraneous material which might render any significant amount of the surface nonwettable. For this reason, it will frequently be desired to clean printed circuit substrates prior to lamination by one or more of the several cleaning processes which are well known in the field of printed circuit board manufacture. The particular type of cleaning depends upon the type of contamination organic, particulate or metallic.Such methods include degreasing with solvents and solvent emulsions, mechanical scrubbing, alkaline soaks, acidification and the like, followed by rinsing and drying. The invention will be more clearly understood by reference to the following examples and the detailed description of the Drawing hereinbelow.

The mixture is coated on a 0.00127 cm thick poly ethylene terephthalate web which has coated on its reverse side a thin layer of a mixture of Carnuba wax and poly vinylidene chloride . The photopolymerizable layer is dried to give a dry thickness of 0.00254 cm and about 30.5 meters of the dried coated element is wound into a roll. Detailed Description of the Drawing Turning now to the drawing, each member of a series of substrates for printed circuits 1 is mechanically advanced in a continuous manner on a roller conveyor through cleaning chamber 3 in which both the upper and lower copper clad surfaces thereof are cleaned by mechanically scrubbing under a heavy water spray. The boards are made of fiberglass reinforced epoxy resin. The cleaned substrate boards are further advanced through alignment rolls 5 by which the sides of the boards are precisely aligned. From the alignment rolls 5, each aligned board emerges and is passed between liquid application rolls 6 into which thin layer liquid in this case, 30 ethanol water solution is admitted via line 7 into the interior of the hollow application rolls 6.Preferably the application rolls 6 consists of a metal core perforated in a regular pattern having thereon a hard porous polyethylene sleave which is covered with a cotton cloth through which the thin layer liquid passes and is coated onto the substrate. Liquid level within the application rolls 7 is limited by fixed level outlet line 8. The liquid films have a thickness of 10 to 50fez . The board with both surfaces coated with a thin layer of liquid is then advanced to a set of upper and lower feed rolls 9 each of which places the unprotected surface of the photosensitive layer of the continuous resist film 11 against the thin liquid layer. The feed rolls 9 place the thermoplastic layer against the surface of the substrate without any significant pressure just before the layer and substrate pass to the nip of the laminating rolls.Any excess liquid is removed from the substrate surface by forming a bead at the nip as the element passes between feed rolls 9. By this means moisture is retained between the layer and substrate and thermal exposure of the layer is limited to the brief time it is within the nip. In the event of a stoppage, the amount of film subject to thermal degradation is reduced substantially. The feed rolls 9 are mechanically linked with the mechanism used for advancing the boards 1 in such manner that the boards are butted up against one another as they enter the feed rolls 9 and there is no significant amount of bridging by the film 11 between the trailing and leading edges of each board. The laminating film prepared as described inExample I is supplied from supply roll 12. The abutting boards 1 with the film resist 11 in place is then advanced through the nips of heated laminating rolls 13 in which the film layers 11 are subjected to both pressure and heat, by which the thin water layer on the photosensitive layer is removed from the substrate mainly by absorption onto the photosensitive layer. The temperature of the laminating roll surfaces is about 2300F and the linear speed of the boards through the laminator is about six feet per minute.During the laminating steps minor amounts of liquid are removed by evaporation. The laminated boards 1 still abutting each other, are advanced at a uniform rate between wedges 15. At the exit of the wedges 15, the polyethylene terephthalate web 17 on the outer surface of the continuous film is pulled back uniformly from the substrate at an obtuse angle here 1500 which causes the photosensitive layer to be trimmed in a straight line along the leading edge of the board 1 . The web 17 is pulled back by the action of take up rolls 19 and the advancing action of the board.As the substrate board 1 emerges from between wedges 15 progressively more of the photosensitive layer is uncovered until the board advances to and is grasped firmly at the sides between a pair of clutch driven rapidly rotating trimming rolls 21 only one is shown which rotate at a speed faster than the linear speed of the advancing board until they grasp the panel sides. The trimming rolls then move with the linear speed of the board by means of a slip clutch which compensates for the difference in driving speeds. The trimming rolls 21 place a transverse tensile stress on the board which causes the thermoplastic layer to be trimmed smoothly along the trailing edge of the board as it emerges from between the wedges 15.When the trailing edge trimming is completed, thus separating the leading and trailing boards in the series, the laminated board is ready for circuit preparation by conventional photoresist techniques. Though the process of the invention as described above is carried out continuously, it will be recognized that the process can also be conducted intermittently as well. Though the invention may be used advantageously in a broad spectrum of photosensitive applications it is particularly useful for the preparation of photoresist elements for lamination to substrates to be used in making printed circuit boards and lithographic printing plates. The exact mechanism by which the photosensitive layers of the invention are rendered self trimming is not known with certainty. However, it appears that the particles not only make the photosensitive layer less elongatable but also render the layer dilatent and provide a path for smooth, accurate breaking of the film when it is subject to a transverse tensile stress. To obtain smooth trimming of the photosensitive layer along the substrate edge it is necessary to apply the tensile force transversely to the edge along which the layer is to be torn. Preferably the tensile force should be applied in a perpendicular manner. It is of course recognized that particles similar to those used in the invention have been incorporated in photosensitive compositions as fillers or extenders and for other purposes as well.For example, dispersed transparent filler particles in photopolymerizable compositions are disclosed inU.S. Patent 3,261,686 to provide improved strength of the layer, reduced tack, and for coloring the composition. Fillers have been used for compositions used for making printing relief from a layer thickness of at least 3 mils, because the nature of the printing relief requires high strength and reduced tack. Tack reduction in particular did not affect adhesion of the printing relief to a rigid support because an adhesive interlayer was used to adhere the layer and the printing relief obtained therefrom to the rigid support.

The photosensitive layer is laminated to one side of cleaned copper clad substrate boards and self trimmed as in Example II. Each of the laminated and trimmed boards is imaged by exposing for sixty seconds the photosensitive layer to UV radiation from a Coligh DMVL HP light source passing through transparent portions of a phototool corresponding to a printed circuit pattern. The phototool is then removed and replaced with a filter which is opaque to W radiation below 40002 and the boards are uniformly exposed for sixty seconds to the visible light of the Colights DMVL HP light source. The imagewise exposed areas are completely removed by development in an aqueous solution of 9 ethyleneglycol monobutyl ether and 1 sodium borate. The imaged and developed laminate is ready for circuit preparation by conventional plating and etching photoresist techniques.

The laminated and trimmed board is imaged by exposing for sixty seconds the photosensitive layer through a halftone transparency to UV radiation from a Colights DMVL HP light source. The unexposed areas are completely removed by development as in an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate to provide a halftone polymeric image with complimentary image areas of bare aluminum surface. The resulting lithographic printing plate is conventionally gummed, inked and used to produce numerous printed copies. Example VI Preparation of a Lithographic Printing Plate A photosensitive coating mixture was prepared and coated as in Example I except that instead of the beads used therein, 16 parts by weight of 1 micron polyethylene beads Microfine VIII F. Gold, tradename of Dura Commodities Corporation,Harrison, NY were dispersed in the coating solution. The surface of a 0.023 cm thick aluminum plate was scrubbed with tungsten carbide brushes in water using a Chemcut Model 107 tradename ofChemcut Corporation, State College, PA MechanicalCleaning System and the scrubbed surface was laminated to the photosensitive layer and the layer trimmed as described in Example I. The laminated and trimmed board was imaged by exposing for 60 seconds the photosensitive layer through a halftone and line transparency to U.V. radiation from a 2000 watt pulsed Xenon arc light source in a flip top platemaker. The unexposed areas were completely removed by development in a 1 aqueous solution of sodium carbonate to provide a halftone polymeric image with complimentary image areas of bare aluminum surface. The resulting lithographic printing plate was conventionally gummed with Lydex Finishing Solution LDFS tradename ofE. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Wilmington, DE and mounted on an A.B.Dick Model 380 offset printing press. Using standard inking and fountain solutions, at least 3500 copies of good quality were obtained from the printing plate.
