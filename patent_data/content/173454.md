# Doctor blade assembly.

## Abstract
A doctor blade assembly has an elongate doctor blade 30 supported in a blade holder 10 . The blade 30 has a projecting front edge 30a adapted to be placed in contact with a moving surface 22 to be doctored, and a rear edge 30b adapted to be received in the blade holder 10 . The blade 30 is preloaded in such a manner that longitudinal tensile stresses are induced in the front edge 30a thereof. The level of such tensile stresses is below the yield strength of the blade material, yet high enough to prevent compressive stresses from developing at the blade front edge 30a as a result of heat being generated by frictional contact between, the blade 30 and the moving surface 22 being doctored.
