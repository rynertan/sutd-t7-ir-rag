These considerations and our knowledge of the generalized therapeutic value of Low FrequencyElectro Magnetic LF EM fields led us to develop aLF EM therapy system, which would be non inv2sive, not costly to the patient, would leave lasting benefits without the continual use of anti inflammatory drugs, and which would be used by non specialists.This form of therapy would be available at short notice to all suffering patients.

The state of the art in rheumatology is reflected by the following quotation from the recent book The Recognition of Anti Rheumatic Drugs edited by Dr. D.C. Dumonde of the matilda and Terence Icennedy Institute of Rheumatology, London, England Rheumatoid arthritis and allied inflammatory diseases represent a major challenge to medical practice and pharmaceutical enterprise. On the one hand, we now admit that the term rheuma tism is without aetiological or pathogenetic significance and the recognition of inflammatory rheumatic disease relies largely upon our ability to assemble deviations from normality into certain patterns which may partly fullfil our national classification criteria. On the other hand, we also admit that current treatment and control of inflammatory rheumatic disease, though increasingly more powerful, represents a halfway stage of achievement. Concerning the underlying mechanism, the same author states There is a growing view that rheumatoid arthritis and allied diseases arise from subtle defects in the regulation of immunological and inflammatory responses upon which both genetic and environmen tal factors may find expression. Electromaanetic hypothesis Our consistently good clinical results in numerous arthritic diseases using LF EM fields and that of others cited hereinafter led us to formulate the following hypothesis many rheumatic diseases may be associated with local electromagnetic pertutao s, and it is therefore logical that these diseases are influenced by low frequency electromagnetic fields. This hypothesis is compatible with Dr. Dumonde s statement cited above, to the effect that environmental factors may find expression in the subtle defects caus ing rheumatoid arthritis and allied diseases. Low Frequency Electromagnetic LF EM Therapy Numerous beneficial biomedical applications of Low Frequency Electromagnetic therapy sometimes identified as magnetotherapy have been reported in the scientific field and the Patent literature as revealed by the literature cited hereinafter, starting as early as 1904 with U.S. Patent No. 90,732 and numerous other publications. Solov eva 1975 , Instrumentation and Applica tion of Low Frequency Magnetotherapy, Biomed, Eny., Vol. 8, No. 3, defines magnetotherapy as consisting of the application of low frequency magnetic fields 50 Hz sinusoidal fields, 50 or 100 Hz pulsating fields, period ically interrupted fields, and sometimes also rotating magnetic fields. It was reported in numerous publications, as for example those of Solov eva 1975 and Mizushima et al. 1975 Effects of Magnetic Field on Inflammation, Experientia, Vol. 31, 12 , that the effectiveness of magnetotherapy is beyond any doubt in numerous thera peutic applications. However, the results of applications of magneto therapy are frequently not uniform mainly because of the different specific characteristics of the instruments used and because of the numerous different ways andzor procedures adopted by the users of a given instrument. It is also recognized that constant magnetic fields have only limited application in medical practice Solov eva 1975 . The state of the art of Magnetotherapy, as defined above, is well summarized in Solov eva 5 paper 1975 . Numerous apparatus and clinical results obtained with them are described in Solov eva s paper.Two types of instruments are reviewed in his paper those using electromagnet inductor s and those using solenoid inductor s . According to Solov eva, in an electromagnet, the field intensity is maximum at the core ends poles and rapidly falls off with distance, so that in use the pathological focus should be as close as possible to one of the electromagnet poles. The same author states that the field set up by a solenoid inductor is strongest in its inner, hollow part, so that in application the pathological region of the body should be surrounded by the solenoid windings Solov eva, 1975 . However, because of the absence of a core, much power is consumed by the solenoid to set up sufficiently strong fields and, the therapeutic application of solenoids is usually accompanied by the release of considerable heat using prior apparatus. Using prior magnetotherapy apparatus, satisfactory results have been obtained in the treatment of trophic ulcers, slowly healing wounds, burns, postoperative infiltrates, gastric diseases, algesic syndrome associated with traumatic injuries of the peripheral nerves, cardio vascular diseases with decompensation effects, bronchial asthma, otorhinolaryngological ailments, diseases of the nervous system, supportive and motorial apparatus, gynecological and skin diseases, impaired functioning of the joints and ligaments, heel bursitis spurs , traumatic edema, pathological motorial functions in children. Improvements of the general state of the patient, a reduction of itching, improved epithelization of ulcerous surfaces and anesthetic effects have also been observed with magnetotherapy. Furthermore, physiological and histochemical data indicate a sedative effect of continuous sinusoidal or pulsating fields associated primarily with assimilation processes and a stimulating effect of intermittent fields associated mainly with dissimilation processes Solov eva . It is also reported in the literature that sedative modes of treatment are indicated in sympaticotonia and orthosympaticotonia, in asthenic neurosis, neurasthenia, contractures, arthrosis, spondylitis, active rheumatism, and complications following viral hepatitis. Stimulating modes are used in parasympaticotonia, depressive neurosis, bronchial asthmia, and inactive rheumatism. A combination of sedative and stimulating modes is effective in algesic and trophic disorders in the extremities. Gynecological disorders were treated using different operation modes and their combinations. Prior studies have shown that the direction in which new nerve processes grow can be controlled by weak electric fields which fields may influence regeneration by directing nerves into the region where they influence blastema formation R. B. Borgens, 1979, Bio Electricity and Limb Regeneration, Encyclopedia Science, Suppl. 1979, pp. 89 93 Biology Grolier Ltd., Toronto, Canada . Several authors who investigated Low FrequencyElectro Magnetic Field reported anti inflammatory effects Mizushima, 1975 , normalization of arterial pressure, diuretic action, normalization of transmembrane electric cal potential of living cells, stimulation of osteogenesis and bone repair and maintenance using specific current pulses Brighton , 1977 , alteration of the amount and rate of calcium influx efflux at the cellular level Bassett2, 1978 , therapeutic effects on the nervous system without significant heating of tissues Adey3, 1973 Gavalas , 1970, Wever5, 1968 Baker6, 1967 , improvement of sleep and pain relief in all kinds of arthritic diseases. Furthermore, several authors have noted the advantages of magnetotherapy over UHF Ultra HighFrequency therapy and induction heating in the book entitled Biological and Therapeutic Effects of MagneticField and Strictly Periodic Vibrations , in Russian,Perm 1948 . One of the reasons for which magnetotherapy give better results than UHF therapy for treating arthritic joints is that deep joint heating associated with UHF fields and diathermy apparatus causes severe side effects and can accelerate cartilage degeneration i.e., Hollander et al.7, 1949 Feibel et al.8, 1976 Licht9, 1965 Lehman et al.10, 1974 Harris et al.11 1974 Harris12, 1974 The measured effects induced with Low FrequencyElectro Magnetic LF EM Fields can be explained neither with classical electrophysiolocy nor with classical neurochemistry.Therefore, new theories were developed to explain the experimental evidence Adey, 1976 . TheLF EM fields not only affect the surface tissues but also permeate bones and the whole organism, and influence all living cells. Our first involvement in Low FrequencyElectromagnetic field applications was in 1969 Drolet13 et al., 1969, Talibi et al., 1970 and it was concerned with the evacuation of the bladder of paraplegic patients, at the Institute ofBiomedical Electronics and Engineering of the University of Toronto, Canada. We have studied the optimal parameters for the electromagnetic evacuation of the urinary bladder including electrode characteristics and different electrical current characteristics. The U.S. and German Patent literature is indicative of the increasing importance of LF EM field in medical treatment. It is important to notice that recently three different instruments using electric current won FDA approval in the U.S.A. for the acceleration of bone repair in fractures that remained open for long periods of time. Only one of these instruments is non invasive.Much of the prior art in this field is described inVol. 238 of the Annals of the New York Academy ofSciences published October 11, 1974, and entitled Electrically Mediated Growth Mechanism in LivingSystems Edited by A. R. Liboff and R. A. Rinaldi . Patent literature on electromagnetic therapy was published as early as in 1904. Indeed, an electromagnetic therapeutic apparatus using electromagnets or coils was patented in 1904 in U.S. Pat. No. 90,732.Hence, the principle of using electromagnetic fields for medical treatment has been known for at least eighty 80 years. Benson 1922 U.S. Pat.No. 1,418,903 described a body receiving electromagnetic coil with means within the electromagnetic coil for generating variable induced currents and applying same to portions of the body under treatment. Mann 1927 U.S. Pat. No. 1,634,373 described an ELECTRIC THERAPEUTIC DEVICE which produces heat, vibrations and eddy currents for the purpose of treating the human body. Mc Lean 1972 U.S. Pat. No. 3,658,051 presented an apparatus and method for treating a living thing or part thereof with intermittent and continuous high intensity higher than 2,000 gauss magnetic fields using a pulse frequency of about 2 Hz. Hallgren 7974 U.S. Pat. No. 3,841,305 illustrated a system for external stimulation for a nerve including a coil of wire with a specific flux concentrating core preferably having a T shape , in which the coil is pulsed by a discharging capacitor and specific circuits are disclosed for charging the capacitor and generating discharge pulses of alternate polarity. Liss et al. 1975 U.S. Pat. No. 3,902,502 described an apparatus for temporarily arresting arthritic pain at local areas of a patient. The apparatus gas conducting leads for carrying the output of the apparatus to contact ends electrodes applied to the skin of the patient at a localized area. This system uses a carrier frequency of between 20 k Hz and 1 M Hz which is amplitude modulated ON OFF at very low frequencies between 10 and 40 Hz. The output of the apparatus is applied for a short period such as 3 to 4 minutes to the treated local area. Paul Jr. 1975 U.S. Pat. No. 3,881,494 discloses an electro pulse system for providing temporary pain relief to arthritic patients through therapeutic use of an electronic circuit involving a selfrepetitive capacitive discharge technique, and a pair of electrodes through which current is flown through the treated area of the patient. Kraus et al. 1975 U.S. Pat. No 3,890,953 described an electrical apparatus for promoting the growth of bone and other body tissues by the application thereto of a low frequency alternating magnetic field.The apparatus consists essentially of a current generator and one or many field applicators. The improvement resides in that the applicator means comprises a flat solenoid coil having an axis about which the coil is wound and composed of a plurality of parallel and flexible windings. Each winding has two adjacent elongate portions and two 1800 coil bends joining the elongate portions together. The frequency of the A.C.current generator is below 150 Hz in the apparatus. Kraus described different coil structures for electromagnetic therapy oval or elliptical cylinder and inclined cylinder U.S. Pat. No. 4,066,065 1978 and corresponding German Pat. No. 2432 493, 1976 prior to the two Patents just cited above, W. Kraus 1974 was author of the German Pat. No. 2,314,573 in which an electromagnetic therapeutic apparatus for the acceleration of bone growth according to Figures is described.His apparatus is composed of at least one electric field applicator two electrodes and one magnetic field applicator coil, single and multiple and the frequency of the A.C. magnetic field is between 1 and 100 Hz with an intensity of between 20 and 200 gauss, and the intensity of the electric field applied being between 0.1 V cm and 1 V cm. The shape of certain coils used in the later apparatus look similar to that of the coils described by the same author in the above cited U.S. Patent No. 3,890,953. R. Buschky German Pat. No. 2,517,896, 1976 and No. 2,533,244, 1977 describes two different magnetic field applicators both cylindrical in shape which are either adapted in a flexible way on a carriage or wall mounted with movable parts. The mechanical structures described in these two patents look bulky and heavy. M. Buschky 1977 German Pat. No. 2,553,197 described an impulse field generator generating LowFrequency currents in the range of 1 Hz to 1 k Hz. Maass 1977 U.S. Pat. No. 4,056,097 describes a contactless stimulus transducer which induces a stimulus current into a biological specimen by means of a changing magnetic field which is produced by an electric field winding on a ferro magnetic core. Lastly, Goldman et al. 1978 U.S. Pat. No.4,095,588 patented a method of cleansing a vascular system comprising arranging a plurality of electromagnetic coils to be separate from each other about an axis in the form of an annular electromagnetic means.The coils are elongated in a direction perpendicular to the magnetic axis of the, coils for encircling with a magnetic field controllable by a variable frequency and amplitude to propel red blood cells radially while rotating about a vascular axis so as to loosen and clear away vascular accumulations tending to block the vascular system. OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THIS INVENTION In contrast to the prior inventions, while also relating to specific biomedical applications of alternating and or pulsating magnetic fields, this invention is concerned with an original compact, portable, mobile and modular Low Prequency Electromagnetic LF EM Therapy System having mechanically and electronically compatible and interchangeable subsystems or units, and including two LF field generators, one pulsating and one sinusoidal generator, both of which can generate continuous or periodically interrupted treatment signals of specific characteristics. Three special treatment units or field applicators, herein referred to as MINI, MOYI and MAXI and four different types of flexible and or adaptable mechanical supports three of which contain one or two adjustable pressure disc breaks , for manipulating the treatment applicators in any desired direction in space a simple support for MINI field applicator, floor and or wall supports for the three field applicators MINI, MOYI, and MAXI , and a 4 wheel carriage support for increased mobility of any of the three field applicators this mobile carriage can be used for treating patients in standard hospital beds or otherwise. The present improved ElectromagneticTherapy System has a wide range of biomedical applications because of the following features wide range of controllable treatment characteristics, well localized treatment in the affected area of the patient non thermal treatment painless treatment treatment without mechanical vibration treatment applied without metallic electrodes treatment by electromagnetic induction of low frequency currents of desired characteristics within the treated region of the body specific magnetization demagnetization feature of the sinusoidal generator specific time pattern of treatment modular structure interchangeable generators, Treatment Units and mechanical supports low weight portability mechanical flexibility wide range of controllable electromagnetic field parameters field intensity, direction, frequency and spatial gradient generated by one sinusoidal and or one pulsating field generator Critical Damping Design for the pulse shaping circuit of the pulsating generator, allowing for a great improvement of the field intensity and effectiveness for a given weight of field applicator and or generator.This system can generate numerous desirable, controllable and useful Low Frequency Electro Magnetic LF EM treatment characteristics. More specifically, as further features of the present invention the following parameters of the LF EM field can be selected or predetermined by this system Peak amplitude of sinusoidal and pulsating fields. With the sinusoidal generator the peak amplitude can be programmed to remain constant, at a pre selectable level 0 to 100 gauss in ten steps when using MAXI, 0 to 300 gauss in ten steps when using MOYI, and 0 to 900 gauss in ten steps when using MINI for a preselectable time MAG TIME 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 minutes and then to automatically drop to zero amplitude, to decrease linearly or quasi exponentially to zero amplitude, in a preselectable time DEMAG TIME 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 minutes . Orientation and or direction with respect to patient or part thereof, of sinusoidal and pulsating fields in space using the four 4 different types of modular mechanical support and or carriage described hereinafter. The Orientation of the field can be in any desired direction. The frequency, in cycles per second, meaning the repetition frequency of pulse bundles with the pulsatile generator or the repetition frequency of sinusoidal wave bundles with the sinusoidal generator can be selected as 60 Hz, 30 Hz, 15 Hz, 7.5 Hz, 3.75 Hz and 1.875 Hz when 60 Hz power is supplied to the generator and 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, and 1.56 Hz when a 50 Hz power is supplied to the generator, 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 elementary sine wave cycle s or current pulse s are generated in bundles and each bundle is followed by an interruption time zero field equal to the time of the said bundle before the origination of a new treating wave bundle, and so on. Time of treatment is preselectable for both sinusoidal and pulsatile generators as indicated in the above subparagraph entitled Upeak amplitude of sinusoidal and pulsating fields .The spatial field gradient in the patient and or treatment region can be preset by choosing the proper Treatment Unit MINI, MOYl or MAXI , and placing it at a proper distance and or orientation with respect to the patient and or treatment region, with the guidance of the so called FIELD PATTERN CHART corresponding to each treatment unit as described hereinafter.

The field applicators, 11, 12 and 13 are used for treatments such as shown in Figures IA, B, C,D and E illustrations, and such as further illustrated by the different combinations of generators, treatment applicators and mechanical supports shown in Figures 3A and B illustrations. The MOYI and MAXI treatment applicators are air coils and the MINI treatment applicator is a core coil as further described in Tables 1 and 2 hereinbefore. The best characteristics of the three treatment applicators resulted from a systematic optimization study where the purpose was to achieve the highest field possible with the smallest and lightest generator possible while allowing a great variety of sinusoidal and pulsating field patterns and with a further object of creating electrically and mechanically compatible and or interchangeable treatment applicators. All this was achieved with the characteristics given in Table 1 and Table 2, and more particularly, interchangeability was achieved by designing treatment coils having approximately the same inductance L approx. 2 millihenry forMINI, MOYI and MAXI .The voltage and current levels were also optimized in order to reduce the number of turns in the windings reducing cost and weight while preventing excessive currents which would cause unacceptable temperature rise of treatment coils when used with maximum power. In a preferred embodiment of thS pulse shaping circuit, Figure BA, well defined relationships exist between the different components of this circuit and the desired current pulse shape e.g., tm EMI30.1 RL 2L C VO e RL rL Damping and ti 2tm where im maximum current flowing through treatment applicator tm period of time between beginning of pulse and time of maximum current im L is the inductance of the treatment applicator RL total series resistance in the capacitor discharging circuit, including the D.C. resistance rut of the treatment applicator in series with all damping resistances amping of the discharging circuit C the capacitance of the capacitor s which is repeatedly charged and discharged by closing and opening K1 and K2 respectively so that K1 is closed when K2 is open and conversely. K1 and K2 are Silicon Controlled Rectifiers. The charging circuit 77 is fed by an alternating current supply, 50 or 60 Hz 115 or 230 Volts as further illustrated in Figure 13. Vo is the maximum voltage to which the capacitor C is charged be is the base of the neperian logarithm e 2.71828 , t. is the period of time from the beginning of the current pulse to the time where the second derivative of the current ic is equal to zero EMI30.2 then t t 2tm as illustrated in Figure 8C of the presentFigure.It can be shown that EMI30.3 where t is the time and i is the current flowing through the treatment coil, for the critical damping design. All three treatment applicators 11, 12 and 13 can be connected to any of the two versions of the generators 10 a and 10 b using a jack connector 32, 33, or 35 which fits its female jack connector 36. Mechanical versatility is still increased by the use of four different types of modular supports which are constructed with a minimum number of standardized parts such as an articulated joint 21, 22, 37, 38 and 46 non magnetic stainless steel 1 1 4 inch rods 20, 39, 56 and 48 bigger rod, 1 1 2 inch , galvanized 8 x 8 inch aluminum plates 25, 41, and 51 are fixed with non magnetic stainless steel screws 26, base plates 15, 16 which can be made of wood covered with suitable material. Casters 52, 54 can be fixed to the base of different mechanical supports 15 and 16, the rear wheels 54 are equipped with a braking mechanism 53 and they are mounted on a rotating base.The base 15 and 16 of mechanical supports can also be fixed to a wall or to the ceiling of a treatment room. The base plate 25, 41 or 51 can be fixed in the middle of the support base 15 or 16 when mechanical stability is preserved for a given set up of mechanical support. Figure 1C shows a simple mechanical support 14 composed of a comfortable cushion 17 and a simple rectangular box to keep the treatment applicator 11 in the desired position. Different height adjustment inserts small wedges or boards can be placed under MINI, 11, for adjusting its level. Support plates 40 and 55 hold the coil 12 and the coil 13 to the base 62 of the articulated joint 37, 46, illustrated in Figure 2. This joint 21, 22, 37, 38 or 46 is composed of a break holder 57, a large flat end screw 58, 59 with a lock pin 60, a thin frictional disc 63, a cylindrical part 64 with a hole 65 to receive the rods 20, 39 or 56. These rods can be rigidly fixed in the hole 65 by tightening two allen screws 67 which cause the slot 66 to narrow. A handle 23, 24, is used to adjust the brake pressure by pressing all parts of the disc brake together when the handle 23, 24 is screwed on the flat end screw 58, 59. Figure 2B shows the details of a connector 47 which serves to hold the rods 48 and 56 at perpendicular angles between each other, while allowing the rods to be partially moved and locked in desired positions.The adjustment is provided by flexible slots adjusted with pressure screws 47 a and 47 b a mechanical coupling 49 50 holds the rod 48 to the base plate 51 see Figure 2C . The screw nut 49 is used to tighten the threaded slotsd rod end 50 onto the vertical rod 48. Figure 3 is a block diagram showing different combinations of generators 10 a or 10 b , treatment applicators 11, 12 or 13 and mechanical supports 14, 15, 16 of the Electromagnetic Therapy System. Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6 show the three field applicators 11, 12, and 13 with their respective field pattern chart as described hereinbefore. Referring now to Figures 7 to 16, there will be described the field generator 10, 10 a and 10 b .The system is intended for medical use and for multiple treatments. The treatment is generated by a magnetization coil 11, 12, 13 properly coupled and fed by a sinusoidal or a pulsating generator 10 a and 10 b .Most of the characteristics of the magnetic field created by the system are selected by the controls on the front panel of the generator 10 as illustrated inFigure 7. In a first option of the system, the electromagnetic field is pulsed Figures 8, 12 and 13 and in a second option, the electro magnetic field is sinusoidal Figures 9, 11 and 15 . As shown in Figure 7, the magnetic field has five characteristics which are adjustable by the controls on the panel 68 of the control unit 10. The first control 69 controls the amplitude or intensity of the electro magnetic field from 0 to 100 as herein shown in increments of 10 . The control 70 controls the frequency of interruption of the fundamental signal of the electro magnetic field in the order of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 cycles of the periodic field, seeFigures 14 and 16 for detailed illustration, with an interruption time respectively equal to 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 cycles of the periodic field, see also Figures 14 and 16.The magnetization time is set by the control 71 and at the termination of the magnetization time, the second phase or the demagnetization phase of the treatment takes place. This demagnetization phase has a time period set by the control 72. The demagnetization can be made in accordance with a linear or quasiexponential characteristic as will later be described with reference to Figure 15. The switch 73 sets the desired characteristic of the demagnetization phase either for linear or exponential demagnetization. Switch 74 is an ON switch for the system while switch 75 is the switch which starts the treatment and the various timers are synchronized with the switch 75. Indicator light 76 indicates the start and termination of the treatment and that current effectively flows through the treatment applicator 11, 12 or 13. A jack 36 is provided to connect the magnetization coil 11, 12 or 13 to the generator 10. Referring again to Figure 8 which is an illustration of the pulse shaping curcuit and pulse wave forms 78 and 79 of the pulsed magnetic field as discussed above, a specific embodiment of the present invention is represented by the following set of values for tmt L, t , C and im choosing tm 0.5 msec for physiological reasons and L 2 m Henry found to be appropriate for the present invention then we can calculate E 2L tm 8 Q, andEMI34.1 andEMI34.2 18.45 Amperes.This set of values represent what is named the critical damping design for the given values of tm and L. Other embodiments of the present invention can easily be reached by using the same set of simultaneous equations for desired values of tm and L.It is intended that the numerical value of the components RI,, L and C of the pulse shaping circuit can be changed so as to cause the peak amplitude of the said current pulse 78 to decrease by not more than 50 of that resulting from the critical damping design defined above and the resulting design is included in the present invention and is an embodiment of it. Referring now to Figure 9. the connection 10 connects to the switch 75 to start the treatment by operating an initiation circuit 115. The treatment will be effected as set by the controls on the generator 10. An audible circuit 108 is actuated during the period of treatment. The current monitor circuit 109 operates the indicator lamp 76 on the console 10. In the second phase of treatment during the demagnetization time, the amp litude is automatically varied by means of an amplitude circuit 118, a mode circuit 119, and an electromagnetic system 110 including a motor not shown coupled to a variable transformer incorporated in the High Voltage Circuit . The interruption of the electromagnetic field to produce pulse signals is effected by means of a power semi conductor Silicon Controlled Rectifier, SCR in the high voltage circuit 111. The entire control unit is fed by a 60 cycle 115 volt supply or 50 cycle 230 volt supply at 112. It is the frequency of the A.C. voltage 112 that determines the fundamental frequency of the magnetic field treatment.A 12 volt D.C. voltage regulated and unregulated is also provided to feed the various electronic and electro magnetic circuits in the apparatus. The various controls 69, 70, 71 and 72 are represented inFigure 9 at inputs 102, 103, 104 and 105. The mode switch 73 is represented at 106. Referring to Figures 9 and 11, the high voltage circuit 111 or ills feeds the current to the magnetic zation coil 11, 12 or 13 and includes a variable autotransformer T1 which permits to adjust the maximum current for a given treatment to the desired value. A voltage transformer T5 lowers the voltage in a manner whereby to obtain a current of high intensity in the coil 11, 12 or 13. A semi condctor of the TRIAL type Q1 permits the interruption of the current in accordance to the desired magnetic field pattern. This TRIAC Q1 is controlled by a signal OP2. Referring to Figures 12, 13 and 8, in the application of a pulse magnetic field, a capacitor C3 C5 is charged with the current in the secondary of the autotransformer T1. The capacitor C3 C5 is then discharged in the treatment coil 11, 12 or 13 and produces a pulse current of high intensity. This is achieved by means of an SCR semi conductor Q3 controlled by a signal OP4. This signal corresponds to the signal OP3 of the capacitor charging circuit 77 except that it is delayed and that the current pulses 78 correspond to the negative cycle of the sinusoidal signal. A detector circuit named zero voltage switch 120 is used to detect the near zero tension of the A.C. supply 112 and to generate the synchronization signal OP1 as shown in Figures 11 and 13. A small cooling fan 121 is used to cool down the damping resistors R8 Rll 5, 250w . When the system is used with a voltage of 230 volts at 50 Hz, an extra input auto transformer is used to reduce this voltage to 115 volts 50 Hz. The D.C. voltage regulator circuit 113 utilizes a transformer which reduces the voltage as is necessary to supply the circuits. A regulator is also used to obtain a continuous voltage of 12 volts and an unregulated 12 volts D.C. The current monitor circuit 109 includes a current transformer 114 T6 and T2 on Figures 11 and 13 which feeds the indicator lamp 76 which permits visual indication that current flows through the magnetization coil 11, 12, 13. Referring now to Figures 9 and 10, the initiation circit 115 is operated by the start switch 75 and is placed in operation by the first pulse of the signal ZC which is similar to the signal OPI. The signal MU at one of the outputs of the circuit 115 determines the speed of the motor acting to position T2 Figure 11 . The signal Q commands the first phase of the treatment Figures 9 and 10 , that is, the MAG TIME phase. The signal MR appears at the.end of the DEMAG TIME and resets all the circuits and the position of the auto transformer T2 Figures 9, 10 and 11 . Referring to Figures 9 to 13, the frequency circuit 116 116S and 116P on Figures 11 and 13 produces an interruption of the magnetization current at a predetermined frequency 103. It generates a series of pulses TR Figure 10 . The signal OP2 or OP4 is retarded relative to the signal OP1 and OP1 and OP3 in the pulsating case in such a manner to interrupt the passage of the current in the treatment coil as illustrated in Figures 10, see ZC,F1, F2...F6 and in Figures 14 and 16, see F1, F2,...F6. The delay circuit 117, Figure 9, generates the time period of the MAG TIME of the treatment as predetermined by the setting on the control 71. At the end of MAGTIME, the signal DL commands the other circuits. The audible tone circuit 108 produces two different frequencies in accordance with the various sections of the treatment. It is operated by the signal Q. The change of the tone of the signal is controlled by the signal DL. The amplitude circuit 118 generates a signal FD of a predetermined frequency in accordance with the function of the DEMAG TIME 105 and set by the control 72. This circuit is controlled by the signal DL during the second phase or the DEMAG TIME of the treanent. This circuit also generates a time base TB.The time unit of this time base is variable in accordance with the setting of the DEMAG switch 72, and allows for generating different demagnetization curves as illustrated in Figure 15, where DEBAG TIME is equal to tf, 30 seconds for the case illustrated, The mode circuit 119 generates a linear curve or a quasi exponential curve of initial amplitude equal to the peak amplitude of the magnetic field generated during the MAG T2HE. This choice is esiablished by the mode switch 73. The time base signal will modify the frequency signal FD in such away as to produce a second signal M3 of which the frequency will control the speed of the motor in circuit 110.This motor is a step by step motor and the direction of rotation of this motor is determined by the signal MU or MD. This motor is fed by a 12 volt supply and controlled by means of transistors. This motor operates a variable auto transformer T2 which in turn modifies the current in the magnetization coil 11, 12 or 13 whereby to demagnetize the coil in accordance with the preset modm characteristic 73, 90, 91 Figs. 7 15 . Figure 12 includes the same component parts of the circuit described in Figure 9 with the exception that it is restricted to the pulse mode, whereas inFigure 9, there is shown both the pulse and the sinus modes. Referring now to Figure 14, there is shown an illustration of wave forms F1, F2.,.F6 for the sinus electro magnetic field treatment. As shown, the basic wave form is a sinusoidal wave form which is either a 60 or 50 HZ signal depending on the frequency supply of the input voltage 112. hEen a 50 Hz supply is fed into the system, then the resulting treatment frequencies F1, F2, ...F6 will be equal to 50 Hz, 25 Hz 12.5 Hz, 6.25 Hz, 3.125 Hz and 1.56 Hz, for both sinus and pulse options. Figure 15 is an illustration of the characteristic of the demagnetization curves when the system is utilized in the linear or the quasi exponential mode. The characteristic of the linear mode is shown at 90 and the quasi exponential mode is shown at 91. The DEMAGTIME tf .5, 1, 1.5 min., etc. as shown on the control 72 of Figure 7. Figure 16 shows the electromagnetic field patterns for the pulse option. The shape of individual pulses is as described above, see Figure 8 and its description hereinbefore.

A small red light below the START switch indicates that current is effect ively flowing through the treatment unit, when the amplitude, A, is above 10 of maxiumum. When the frequency is below 20 Hz, this red light flickers During the entire time of treatment, an audible tone is generated at the end of the treatment, the amp litude of the magnetic field is automatically decreased to zero, and the audible tone is auto matically turned off. Remove the patient from the treatment unit MOYI or MEXI or away from the MINI treatment unit. Turn the amplitude control knob to zero, and turn the POWER switch OFF. General working instructions Patients should not be treated late in the evening because, occasionally, disturbed sleep may occur. During the treatment, the patient should be placed in a comfortable position. The patient is usually sitting during treatment. The patient does not need to undress for treatment with the RHUMART therapy system. Watches and other ferromagnetic materials worn by the patient should be removed, as they disturb the magnetic field. Other metallic objects do not need to be removed by the patient. The treatment units MINI, MOYI or MAXI should not be lined with blankets or other isolating material, as the waste heat could not be carried away, and overheating might result. Moderate heating of the treatment unit is normal after a long period of treatment with high dosage. The system can be operated without interruption over a long period of time. It may be left in operation continuously although it is not recommended. The first 5 to 10 treatments should be carried out on consecutive days if possible, or at least every second day. The subsequent treatments may be carried out every third day or less often.Not all patients respond in an equally positive way to the sinusoidal Ri 2000S or pulsating Ri 2000P magnetic field.If the patient does not respond to the magnetic field after the 4th or 5th treatment, and if he she does not feel any effect, you should always consider to to use the Ri 2000S control unit if the Ri 2000P was used for this patient and reversely. After 3 or 4 treatments, you should decide whether there is any reason for continuing the therapy. However, there have been cases where the patients felt a positive effect only after the 15th or even the 20th treatment.This is sometimes the case with chronic degenerative diseases.A slight increase in the complaint after the first.two or three treatments is not unusual, since this is the initial adaptive phase of the treatment course, and it is not a reason to interrupt the therapy, because improvement will probably follow in most cases. Such an adaptive phase is known to occur in other forms of therapy.Make sure that the activation of a latent focus does not lead to complications. If, after the 1st to 3rd treatment, continuous pain is felt in the region of the body where the focus happens to be, then stop the treatment course.

The asterisk means gradual increase i.e., the first treatment should be carried out at 30 of the indicated value, the second at 70 and the third treatment at 100 . In case of several Indications, one should always atsrt with the indication that requires the lowest intensity and frequency. The first figure indicates the intensity in Gauss, the second figure indicates the frequency in Berth, and the third indicates the period of treatment, in minutes. The 3 treatment units have been named MAXI, MOYI and MINI Which treatment unit should be used MAXI can be used for all recommended indications The conversion of amplitude A to Gauss is indicated on MAXI itself. see Figure 6 for the FIELD PATTERN CHART .MOYI can be used for all recommended indicattns where the treatment unit need not be placed around the torso or around the waist of adults The con version of amplitude A to Gauss is indicated on MOYI itself. see Figure 5 for details .MINI can be used in all localized disorders focus and in systemic disorders by treating via the hands and feet The conversion of amplitude A to Gauss is indicated on MINI itself for the maximum field near the treating end of MINI. See the FIELD PATTERN CHART Figure 4 for the amplitude intensity and direction of the field around the MINI Treatment Unit. For the Ri 2000S system, it is suggested to use the same parameters as those used with the Ri 2000P sys tem, except for the period or time of treatment. With the Ri 2000S system, the total time of a treat ment is divided in two parts the MAG TIME and the DEMAG TIME and it is suggested to use 25 of the time indicated in the above Table for the MAG TIME and the same value for the DEMAG TIME. Therefore, the total time of treatment suggested with the Ri 2000S is 50 of the treatment time indicated in the above Table.

TREATMENT Important In many cases, the biological effects which results from weak electromagnetic fields can not be generated by strong fields. Therefore, it is recommended to start the therapy with weak fields and low frequencies, and gradually increase them from treatment to treatment At the end of the therapy, it is recommended to decrease these parameters amplitude and frequency gradually in the last few treatments. The Ri 2000S sinusoidal field system is particularly indicated to complete a treatment course, as the DEMAGNETIZATION phase during DEMAGTIME of the treatment automatically causes the amplitude of the field to decrease at a desired rate 0.5 min. to 30 min. period for a choice of two different decay modes LINEAR or EXPONENTIAL .i First phase of treatment During this intial phase, the treatment should always be carried out with a 30 initial amplitude, frequency and time when the asterisk t is shown in the TABLE OF I CATIONS Table 3 the second treatment can reach 70 of the desired amplitude, frequency and time only the third treatment should be carried out with the desired maximum values given in the TABLE OF INDIcATIONS. The subjective feelings of the patients should be used as an indicator. It is important to use all information available in the present document in order to determine op timum dosage, as this effort will be rewarded by much faster results, taking advantage of previous clinical experiences. ii Second phase of treatment This is RHUMART therapy using the maximum recommended dosage for a particular application seeTable 3 . The duration of treatment varies from 0.5 to 30 minutes daily, up to 3 times a week, 2 times a week and sometimes weekly, The total number of treatments depends on the state of the individual case and it varies from patient to patent. iii Third phase of treatment As indicated above, at the end of the treatment course, it is recommended to decrease the amplitude, frequency and time of treatment gradually in the last few treatments. The Ri 2000S may also be used ad vantageously to complete a treatment course, as the DEMAGNETIZATION phase provided by this system auto matically causes the amplitude of the field to decrease at a desired rate, as described hereinbefore.2. SELOTING PULSE FREQUENCY In ceneral, the FREQUENCY of any periodic process is the number of full cycles within a time interval second . Definition of PULSE FREQUENCY For the pulsating system, pulse frequency is the repetition frequency of pulse bundles, in bundles per second Hz . The basic frequency is the frequency of repetition of pulses in each pulse bundle 60 Hz or 50 3z, depending on the frequency of the sinusoidal current supplied to the control unit For the sinusoidal system, pulse frequency is the repetition frequency of the sinusoidal wave bundles, in bundles per second Hz . The basic frequency is the frequency of the sinusoidal field in each sine wave bundle 60 H2 or 50 Hz, depending on the fre quency of the sinusoidal current supplied to the control unit . With the RHUMART therapy system, a pulse frequency rae between 1.56 Hz to 60 Hz is used. This frequency range 1.56 60 Hz is divided in two frequency domains which are used for most therapeutic applications i.e. .e The LOW FREQUENCY range below 7.5 Hz is used for treatment of ACUTE INFLAMMATORY process, and the HIGHER FREQUENCY range above 25 Hz is used for treatment of CHRONIC DEGENERATIVE processes. 3. USE OF HIGH DOSAGE Higher dosage i.e. frequency above 25 Hz, intensity of field above 50 Gauss and time period of treatment longer than 10 minutes should be applied for treat ing degenerative disorders caused by chronic in flammatory processes such as Osteoporosis Arthrosis of the knee and hip joints, paralyses, fractures, muscular atrophy Osteochondrosis and spondylarthrosis of the spine with degenerative changes in the discs.4. USE OF LOW DOSAGE In many acute or painful diseases, low dosages should be used frequency below 7.5 Hz, intensity of field below 30 Gauss and time period of treatment below 10 minutes .5. RHUART THEPAPY COMBINED TO OTHER TYPES OF MEDICAL PROCEDURES RKUMART therapy can be combined with classical medi cal procedures such as balneological procedures and chemotherapy with the exception of antibiotics and bacteriological treatments where RHUM ERT therapy is not recommended . The therapies of nature cure practitioners such as neural therapy using electric currents and ozone therapy or negative ion therapy as well as all homeopathic treatment modalities can be advantageously combined with RHUMART therapy.For all the above possibilities of combined procedures, RHUMART therapy can be used either simultaneously, before or immediately after the tzeat ment combined with RHUMART therapy. However, during the entire RHUMART therapy treatment course, no diagnostic X ray nor ionizing radiation treatments should be carried out.
