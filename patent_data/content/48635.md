# Copier document handling apparatus.

## Abstract
A copier document handling apparatus 10 with a reversible direction of motion document feeding belt 14 having one flight 18 of the belt overlying the imaging station for document feeding and a second flight 22 spaced therefrom, means for providing decreased pressure between the belt and the document for registration 23 but increased pressure for positive document ejection, in which this pressure change is self actuating and solely from the reversal movement of the belt by a frictional actuating means 30 which is engaged and moved without slippage by the second upper belt flight 22 through a connecting lever system 24 connecting the frictional actuating system 30 with the pressure system 32 so as to automatically pivot the pressure system 32 into or out of engagement with the first belt flight 18 automatically in response to the reversal of direction of the second belt flight 22 .
