# Method and apparatus for detecting bubbles in a liquid.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for sensing the presence of bubbles in a liquid wherein radiation is directed through said liquid toward a radiation responsive sensor and the differen tial between the response of the sensor when a bubble is not present in the radiation path and the response thereof when a bubble is present in the radiation path is markedly increased by limitation of the radiation which can reach said sensor to wavelengths strongly absorbed by said liquid.
