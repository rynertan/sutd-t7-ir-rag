# Communication controller in a data processing system.

## Abstract
A communication controller integrated into a data pro cessing system comprising a central processing unit 1 with a main control storage 3 and a local storage 2 , the system further comprising a number of high speed adap ters 6 10 connected to the central processing unit by means of a high speeds bus 5 , the high speed adapters serving a plurality of input output devices. At least one of the high speed adapters is a high speed bus adapter 7 controlling over a low speed bus 12 a number of low speed communication line adapters 11, 15 19 . All micro codes for controlling the operation and diagnostic of the various communication lines 20 is located in a communi cation control storage 4 in the main control storage 3 .
