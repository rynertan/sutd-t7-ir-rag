# Flame retarded thermoplastic styrenic compositions.

## Abstract
Polytetrafluoroethylene resin within a specific particle size range, preferably about 70 to about 700 Âµ, in polymeric thermoplastic styrenic compositions containing convention al flame retardant additives permits reducing the amount of such additives in the composition to levels low enough to avoid adverse effect on performance properties of such com positions which would otherwise occur at higher levels of such additives necessary to achieve UL 94 flame retardant performance.
