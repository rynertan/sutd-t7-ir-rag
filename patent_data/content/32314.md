The present invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I wherein Zis CH2, or a pro drug thereof which process comprises the reaction of a compound of the formula IX Ar.CO.Cl IX or an equivalent acylating agent wherein Ar is as defined in relation to formula I , with a compound of the formula X EMI12.1 wherein Q is a group of the sub formulae a d as hereinbefore defined or a group of the sub formula e CHRl CH2 Co CH3 e wherein R1 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group and thereafter if desired Cr necessary reducing the carbonyl present in a group of the sub formula e to a CHOH group. The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of the compounds of the formula I whereinZ is CH2 which process comprises the reaction of a compound of the formula IX Ar.CO.Cl IX or an equivalent acylating agent wherein Ar is as defined in relation to formula II , with a compound of the formula XI EMI13.1 wherein R1 is as defined in relation to formula I and thereafter if desired reducing the carbonyl group X to a CHOH group X and ar thereafter converting the CO orCHOH group X to a pro drug thereof. The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of the pro drugs of the compounds of the formula I wherein Z is CH2 which process comprises the reaction of a compound of the formula IX as hereinbefore defined or an equivalent acylating agent with a compound of the formula XII EMI13.2 wherein Q is a group of the sub formulae a d as hereinbefore defined. Suitable equivalent acylating agents to the compounds of the formula IX include the corresponding bromide, anhydride and the like, for example the corresponding azide or mixed anhydride. The reaction of the compounds of the formulae IX and X , XI or XII takes place in an inert solvent or under conventional Friedel Crafts acylation conditions, for example in an inert solvent and optionally in the presence of a Lewis acid such as aluminium chloride. The acylation react ion is normally carried out at 0 a non extreme temperature for example from about 5 C to 500C and more usually from about 100C to 300C if a Lewis acid is used. If no catalyst is used the acylation reaction is normally carried out at a higher temperature e.g. 1000C. Suitable solvents for carrying out the acylation include tetrachloroethylene, chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, chlorobenzene or the like or benzene, toluene, nitrobenzene or the like. The solvent system used for the process of this invention will be homogenous and will advantageously comprise an inert component and a tertiary amine. In general the inert component will predominate, for example it will comprise 60 90 v v of the total system and more usually from 80fro to 92 v v. Toluene and tetrachloroethylene are favoured inert solvents. Suitable tertiary amines include conventional weak tertiary amines such as pyridine and the like. When the solvent system employed contains a tertiary amine it is frequently advantageous not to employ a Lewis acid catalyst as acceptable yields are obtained in the absence of said catalyst. This form of the reaction may be performed at a low, ambient or elevated temperature but in general it is preferred to use a somewhat elevated temperature to ensure that the reaction is over in a reasonably short period. Thus, for example, a temperature of 40 1400C is generally suitable, for example 804120 C. The product produced by acylation in the presence of a Lewis acid may be isolated in conventional manner, for example by diluting with an aqueous acid, extracting into an organic solvent, washing and drying the organic phase and thereafter evaporating the solvent. The resulting dike tone may then be purified by chromatography and or recrystallisation. The product produced by acylation in the absence of a Lewis acid may often be obtained simply by the evaporation of the solvents. If the resulting product is required in a purer form it may normally be further purified by chromatography in conventional manner. The diketones of the formula I ie when X is CO and Z is CH2 may be converted to the corresponding compounds wherein X is a CHOR by careful reduction with a complex hydride such as sodium borohydride in an lower alcohol.The resulting compound may be separated by conventional methods of column chromatography from any contaminant resulting from reduction of the aromatic ketone. The compounds wherein X is a CHOH group may be acylated in conventional manner, for example, by reaction with the acid R2C02H in the presence of a condensation promoting agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in an aprotic solvent such as dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran or by reaction with an acyl halide in the presence of an acid acceptor such as pyridine. The pro drugs of the compo zads of the formula I may be prepared from the compounds of the formula I in conventional manner. Thus, for example, those compounds containing a side chain of the sub formula a may be prepared by the acylation of a compound of formula I containing a 2 position side chain of the sub formula f EMI16.1 Acylation may be carried out by conventional methods such as those described in U.K. Patent No. 1538473. Also for example, those compounds containing a side chain of the sub formulae b , c or d may be prepared by the enol acylation, enol etherification or acetalation of a compound offormula I containg a 2 postion side chain of the sub formula f EMI16.2 Suitable conventional methods of enol acylation, enol etherification or acetalation include those described in U.S.Patent No. 4180585. The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I wherein X is a CO groupand Z is CH2 which process comprises the oxidation of a compound of the formula XIII EMI17.1 wherein Ar and R1 are as defined in relation to formula I for example, with oxygen in aqueous dimethylformamide in the presence of palladium chloride and cuprous chloride. The oxidation reaction may be effected using pure oxygen or air. In general it is sufficient to blow air through the reaction mixture at an ambient or slightly elevated temperature to effect oxidation. The desired compound may be obtained from the reaction mixture by dilution with water followed by extraction into waterimmiscible solvent such as chloroform which may then be dried and evaporated. This initial crude material may be purified chromatographically if desired, for example by column chromatography over silica gel using 1 1 ether petrol as eluant. The compounds of the formula XIII may be prepared by the decarboxylation of a corresponding compound of the formula XIV EMI17.2 wherein Ar and R1 are as defined in relation to formula IV . The decarboxylation may be effected by heating, 0 for example to 170 210 C. The desired product may be obtained by trituration under a non hydroxylic solvent such as chloroform. The acid of the formula XIV may be obtained by hydrolysis of the corresponding ethyl ester using normal sodium hydroxide solution followed by neutralisation with hydrochloric acid. The desired ethyl ester may be prepared by the allylation of the corresponding compound of the formula XV EMI18.1 wherein Ar and E are as defined in relation to formula I . Such allylations may be brought about by generating an anion of the formula XV , for example with sodium hydride in dimethoxyethane, and quenching said anion with allyl bromide. Alternatively, compounds of the formula XIV may he prepared by direct allylation of the carboxylic acid derived from a compound of formula XV . The ethyl ester of a compound of the formula XIV wherein R1 is a methyl group may alternatively be prepared by methylation of the corresponding ethyl ester wherein R1 is a hydrogen atom, for example by sequential reaction with sodium hydride and methyl iodide. The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I whereinZ is CHOR which process comprises the oxidation of a compound of the formula I wherein the 2 position side chain is of the formula b wherein R3 is a C14 alkyl group, that is a compound of formula XVI EMI19.1 and thereafter if desired or necessary reducing the resulting compound of formula I wherein Z is CHOH and X is CO to a compound wherein Z is CHOH and X is CHOH. The oxidation is suitably carried out using m 0 chloroperbenzoic acid at 0 5 C in mixed solvents such as diethylether water. Reduction of compounds wherein X is CO may be effected using a complex hydride such as sodium borhydride under conventional conditions. Compounds of the formula XVI may be prepared by enol etherification of a compound of formula I containing a 2 position side chain of the sub formula e as hereinbefore defined.
