# Time base corrector.

## Abstract
In a time base corrector incorporated a video tape recorder, if a time during which a vertical synchronizing signal is written in a memory unit 2 exceeds one horizontal period segment, the video signal stored at the first address of the memory unit 2 is dropped out during data reading operation. To overcome the above problem a write address designation signal ADW is once latched in response to a vertical synchronizing signal PBV a predetermined number is subtracted from the latched address number the sub tracted a address number is loaded in a counter 16 in response to a reference vertical synchronizing signal REFV and is incremented in response to a reference horizontal synchronizing signal REFH in order to shift the read start address, thus preventing video signals stored in the memory unit 2 from being dropped off.
