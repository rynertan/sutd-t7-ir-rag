## Description
Title O RING MOLD FOR PERFLUOROELASTOMERS DescriptionTechnical Field This invention relates to an improved O ring mold preferably intended for use in the preparation of O rings made of perfluoroelastomers, and to the improved method of making such O rings using the improved mold of the present invention. In particular, the present invention relates to such an improved mold for use in the preparation of O rings and a method of using the same, which mold and method are specially adapted to reduce or eliminate backrindingBackground Art The art of compression molding of O rings is old and highly developed.However, as new extra high performance materials are developed to deal with sealing problems previously unsolved, the possibility of practical problems associated with the preparation of o rings from such extra high performance materials exists. One such example is with materials of the type described in detail by Kalb et al. in Polymerization Reactions and New Polymers , Advances in Chemistry Series, No. 129, pages 13 26 1973 or as described by Breazeale in copending U.S. PatentApplication No. 83,751.Materials such as those described in these references provide extraordinary resistance to chemical and environmental attack, which resistance renders such materials ideally suited for use in O rings where such extraordinary conditions are likely to be encountered and where, previously, there had been no satisfactory materials capable of surviving such extraordinary attack for any significant length of time. Conventional molds for use in preparingO rings are shown, for example, in U.S. Patent No.2,148,079, granted February 21, 1939 to Martin.FIG. 2 in Martin shows a configuration that has become common today namely an O ring cavity with an enlarged flash cavity near, but not next to, theO ring cavity. This configuration permits hand stripping the flashing from the finished O rings. It has been found, however, that when compression molding certain materials, such as those disclosed by Kalb et al. and Breazeale, in conventional molds such as those disclosed by Martin, backrinding becomes a significant problem and results in an unacceptably high number of rejects.Backrinding refers to the distortion at the mold line, usually in the form of wrinkles, folds, tears or indentations see e.g., ASTM Special TechnicalPublication No. 184, Glossary of Terms Relating toRubber and Rubber like Materials The cause of backrinding can vary, and solutions to this problem have been equally varied see, e.g., MechanicalMolded Goods, Neoprene and Hypalon , D.C. Thompson,Elastomers Division, E. I. du Pont de Nemours andCompany, pages 25 26, 84 85 1955 Backrinding ofMolded Products, Embert L. Stangor, Rubber Age, vol.60, pages 439 42 1947 or Fluoroelastomers, R. G.Arnold et al. r Rubber Chemistry and Technology, vol.46, page 641 2 1973 . While the references mentioned above offer various solutions to the problem of backrinding, none have been completely satisfactory, and none have been directed to the problem of backrinding as it exists in the compression molding of O rings made of perfluoroelastomers, such as those disclosed by Kalb et al. and Breazeale. Disclosure of the Invention The present invention relates to a specific improved O ring mold which is designed to reduce or eliminate backrinding in compression molding ofO rings, especially in O rings made of perfluoroelastomers. The mold of the present invention incorporates a conventional O ring cavity, flash channel and flash cavity, but further incorporates an enlarged section of the flash channel adjoining the O ring cavity. It should be understood that there generally will not be a flash channel, per se, machined or otherwise provided in the mold.Rather such a channel will be formed by the space between opposing surfaces of the mold which surfaces are commonely known as lands , which space can be created by incomplete mating of the lands or by the surfaces being forced slightly apart by internal pressure. Although this effect is not completely understood, this configuration has been found to reduce or eliminate backrinding so commonly found at the parting line of the mold, particularly in O rings made of perfluoroelastomers, such as those disclosed by Kalb et al. and Breazeale. Even if backrinding should occur, the damaged or deformed section is generally in the portion formed in the enlarged flash channel, but not on the surface of the O ri ng.The enlarged flashing adjacent the O ring can be conveniently trimmed by a conventional die cutter or by slit trimming, i.e., where the O ring is positioned and moved along its circumference relative to an adjacent blade. It should be understood that the present, invention includes both molds with single either interior or exterior and double flash cavities. Where a double flash cavity is used, the flash channel on each side of the O ring cavity is enlarged adjacent to the O ring cavity. Where a single flash cavity is used, the flash channel is enlarged adjacent to the O ring cavity, but only on the same side of the O ring cavity as the flash cavity.Naturally, it is preferred to use molds with a double flash cavity and with enlarged flash channels on both sides of the O ring cavity. However, where some backrinding is acceptable on one side or the other, one may choose to use a mold with only a single flash cavity and a single enlarged section of flash channel. The dimensions of any parting line projection on the finished product are important to insure that the O ring falls within generally accepted industry standards or specifications such asSAE Society of Automotive Engineers AS 871A, SAE 568A and MIL STD 413B. Each of these standards is equivalent to the other in the portions relevant to the present invention in particular, each requires that the parting line projection of the finished product be no wider than 0.13 mm and no longer than 0.08 mm. Accordingly, the dimensions chosen for use in the mold of the present invention will be consistent with these requirements. However, it should be understood that there can be departure from these dimensions if the finished product should be intended for a use not governed by these industry standards, or should these industry standards be modified.Brief Description of the Drawings FIGS. 1, 4 and 7 are cross sectional views of various O ring molds of the present invention.FIG. 1 shows a mold with a double flash cavity. FIG. 4 shows a mold with a single internal flash cavity. FIG. 7 shows a mold with a single external flash cavity. FIGS. 2, 5 and 8 show O rings 6, 16 and 26 made in each of the molds shown in FIGS. 1, 4 and 7, respectively, in each case after stripping of the excess flash but before final trimming of the enlarged flash. FIGS. 3, 6 and 9 show O rings made in each of the molds shown in FIGS. 1, 4 and 7, respectively, in each case after final trimming of the enlarged flash. It should be understood that in each of theFIGS. 1 9, dimensions are not necessarily to scale, i.e., certain dimensions are exaggerated so that the mold shape can be more readily seen. Dimensions are described in greater detail below. Referring to FIGS. 1, 4 and 7, there are shown molds 1, 11 and 21 in which there is located an 0being cavity 2, 12 or 22. It should be understood that while the FIGS. 1 9 show O ring cavities with circular cross section only, other cross sections, e.g., square, rectangular, eliptical or v shaped, are possible and are intended to be within the scope of the present invention. The O ring cavity may be of any diameter as would correspond to the required cross sectional diameter of the finished productO ring, generally at least 0.5 mm, and perhaps as big as 20 mm, or even larger. Commercially available O rings generally have a cross sectional diameter of 1 10 mm. Similarly, the overall diameter of theO ring, generally measured as inside diameter, can range from as small as 2.5 mm to as large as desired. Commercially available O rings generally have an inside diameter of 2.5 750 mm. It should be understood that the mold of the present invention is applicable regardless of the cross sectional diameter or the inside diameter of the finished product 0being. Immediately adjacent to the 0being cavity 2, 12 or 22, and on each side of the O ring cavity where there is a flash cavity, 5, 15 or 25, there is located an enlarged flash channel, 3, 13 or 23. In order to conform to the industry standards referred to above, the thickness or height of the enlarged flash channel should be not larger than 0.13 mm, preferably 0.08 0.1 mm. It has been found that backrinding and damage to the finished product caused thereby is minimized when the length of the enlarged flash channel, 3, 13 or 23, is at least 0.25 mm.Although its maximum length is limited only by economics, preferably the length of the enlarged flash channel is 0.5 1.0 mm. Connecting the enlarged flash channel with the flash cavity, 5, 15 or 25, is a conventional flash channel 4, 14 or 24 with a length of about 0.5 3.8 mm, preferably 0.5 1.8 mm. The mold of the present invention is used in substantially the same manner as would be a conventional mold. The O ring material is extruded to give a continuous solid preform of the desired cross section slightly larger than the cross sectional diameter of the O ring cavity in the mold. The preform is cut and placed into the O ring cavity of the mold. The mold is closed, compressed and heated for a predetermined time. Typical press cure conditions include temperature of 100 300 C, with sufficient applied force to maintain mold closure, and cure time of 3 minutes 2 hours, all depending on the particular material being cured. For a fluoroelastomer such as disclosed by Ralb et al. or Breazeale, cure conditions will be 30 45 minutes, at about 1750C, followed by post cure. Other materials may not required post cure. During the compression molding cycle, excess material will be forced into the enlarged flash channel, through the conventional flash channel and into the flash cavity. Excess material formed in the conventional flash channel, usually of a thickness of o,Ots om HOi inch or less, and the flash cavity can be easily stripped by hand or otherwise from the finished O ring leaving the excess material formed in the enlarged flash channel. This excess material can then be trimmed by a conventional die cutter or by slit trimming. The thickness of the enlarged flash channel will determine the width 8, 18 or 28 of any parting line projection. Thus one of the two principal requirements of the industry standards is satisfied automatically. There remains the task of accurately trimming the enlarged flash 7, 17 or 27 from the 0being so that the length 9, 19 or 29 of the parting line projection is not more than 0.08 mm. This final trimming can be accomplished with a conventional die cutter or by slit trimming.Industrial Applicability The apparatus and method of the present invention are useful for the preparation of O rings which have predetermined and precise dimensional requirements, particularly as to width and length of any parting line projection. The present invention is especially well suited for use with O ring materials that have a tendency to backrind, such as the perfluoroelastomers disclosed by Kalb et al. andBreazeale. Best Mode Although the best mode of the present invention may depend upon the particular O ring material used, the dimension of the O ring, and its intended use, generally the most preferred embodiment of the present invention is as shown in FIG. 1 where the thickness of the enlarged flash channel is 0.1 mm, the length of the enlarged flash channel is about 0.8 mm, and the length of the conventional flash channel is about 1.3 mm. The present invention having been described and exemplified above and in FIGS. 1 9, it should be understood that variations thereof can be made therefrom by those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the teachings of the present application. Accordingly, reference should be made to the claims following to determine the scope of the present invention.
