# Sealant compositions and seals which expand upon absorption of water and processes for their use.

## Abstract
A sealing process uses an aqueously swelling water sealant composition comprising 10 to 40 weight of rubber whose main ingredient is reclaimed rubber, 10 to 20 weight of silicic compound, 10 to 60 weight of bentonite, and 10 to 40 weight of plasticizer. The composition may be extruded into an elongate water stopper with or without a core therein, and can be inserted into a joint gap or other gap of structural members to stop water at the gap.
