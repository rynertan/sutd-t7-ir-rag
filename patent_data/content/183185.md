# Differential reference voltage generator for NMOS single supply integrated circuits.

## Abstract
Voltage reference is generated by a current generator which, trough a current mirror amplifier, biases an enhance ment MOS transistor as well as a depletion one, so that the desired voltage is equal to the difference between their threshold voltages.
