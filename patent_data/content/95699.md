# A controller.

## Abstract
A controller for producing electrical control signals has a relatively stationary supporting section 2 providing an upwardly facing hand supporting surface 3 and an upward projection, and has a stick like control section 1 mounted on a first gimbal joint 11 on top of the projection, to swing about pitch and roll axes. A second gimbal joint 51 is spaced along the roll axis X from the first one and rotates about said roll axis and about a gimbal axis parallel to the pitch axis. A gimbal ring 12 of the first joint 11 is rigidly connected to a gimbal member 52 of the second joint 51 for unison rotation about the roll axis X . A second gimbal member 42 of the second joint 51 is caused to rotate about said gimbal axis in unison with swinging of the control section 1 about the pitch axis by a linkage connection 40 between them. A signal generator 39 for each of the pitch and roll axes and a stick force generating means 33 for each of those axes are connected with respective gimbal members of the second joint.
