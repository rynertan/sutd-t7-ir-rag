## Abstract
A snap action closure 12 is provided with a body 16 for being mounted on a container and with a cover 18 hing ed to the body 16 . The closure 12 includes two spaced apart connecting elements 70 . Each connecting element 70 is joined to the body 16 with a first hinge 71 and to the cover 18 with a second hinge 72 so as to locate the connecting elements 70 offset on one side of the hinge axis 50 when the cover 18 is in the open position. Each connecting element 70 has a generally linear con figuration adjacent the cover 18 and body 16 when the cover 18 is in the closed position and has a non linear con figuration lying generally in a plane parallel to the main hinge axis 50 when the cover 18 is in the open position.
