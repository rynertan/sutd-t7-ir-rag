# CATIONIC ELECTRODEPOSITION COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING FURFURYL ALCOHOL BLOCKED POLYISOCYANATE CURING AGENT

## Abstract
Cationic electrodeposition compositions comprising a cationic resin containing active hydrogens and a furfuryl alco hol blocked polyisocyanate curing agent are disclosed. The compositions have good low temperature curing properties such that they can be cured at temperatures of 275 320 F. 135 160 C in 20 45 minutes.
