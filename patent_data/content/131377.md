# A belt conveyor.

## Abstract
A conveyor comprises an endless belt 7 with bottomless buckets 33 or other gripping elements bolted to its outer surface at spaced locations thereon. Two resilient rail mem bers 11 extend along the length of and are secured to the inner surface of the belt. Each rail member 11 comprises two rows of discrete blocks 13 which define therebetween a longitudinal bore which loosely receives a respective endless wire rope 9 . The side walls of the blocks 13 are sloping so that each resilient member is of trapezoidal cross section. The belt 7 is trained around two end pulleys 1 and 3 each of which is formed with two grooves 29 to receive the resilient rail members. The grooves 29 are also of trapezoidal cross section but are slightly narrower in width than the resilient rail members 11 . Thus, when the members 11 pass over the pulleys and engage in the grooves 29 the wire ropes 9 are firmly coupled to the belt 7 by the wedging action created as the tension in the endless belt 7 pulls the associated rows of discrete blocks 13 forming each rail member 11 down into the associated pulley groove 29 so that radial forces tending to pull the belt away from the end pulleys and lateral forces tending to cause the belt to creep are resisted
