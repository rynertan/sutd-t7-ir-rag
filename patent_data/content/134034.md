# Rear entrance ski boot.

## Abstract
The invention is concerned with a rear entrance ski boot which comprises a boot shell 2 to which a front quarter 3 and a rear quarter 4 are connected. The peculiar aspect of the invention resides in that it comprises an instep presser element 10 located inside the shell 2 and being connect ed proximate to the lateral extremities thereof, to said front quarter 3 . The front quarter 3 is associated with the shell 2 for oscillation about a substantially horizontal axis, rela tively perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of develop ment of said shell 2 and for translation capabilities along said longitudinal direction of development of said shell 2 . With the above arrangement, by operating the boot 1 closure levers 5 , the instep presser 10 is concurrently operated.

## Description
nRSAR UTRSUCE SEI BOOT This invention relates to a rear entrance ski boot. As is knowzi, rear entrance ski boots comprise, in their traditional design, a boot shell to which a front quarter and rear quarter are hinged and are closed in abutment by means of fastening levers. In order to securely lock the user s foot within the ski boot, it is common practice to provide, inside the shell, a foot instep presser which is actuated through independent mechanisms or levers, remote from the boot fastening levers. This approach involves a highly complex construction, and is not always favored by the user, who is required to adjust and fasten a number of mutually independent elements. It is an object of this invention to obviate such prior problems by providing a rear entrance ski boot which can be provided with a presser element the actuation whereof is effected directly during the boot fastening operation. A further object of the invention is to provide a rear entrance ski boot which affords a novel type of connection between the front quarter and shell, thereby achieving a more secure and reliable locking of the users foot inside the boot. It is another object of the invention to provide a rear entrance ski boot hinh has a greatly simplified construction, while giving full assurance of reliability and safety in use. These and other objects, such as will be apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a rear entrance ski boot comprising a shell whereto front and rear quarters are connected, and characterized in that it comprises a foot instep presser element located inside said shell and being connected proximate to the lateral extremities thereof to said front quarter, said front quarter being associated with said shell for oscillation about a substantially horizontal axis, relatively perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of development of said shell and for translation capabilities along said longitudinal direction of development of said shell. Further features and advantages will be more clearly understood from the following description of a preferred, though not exclusive, embodiment of a rear entrance ski boot, with reference to the accompanying illustrative and not limitative drawing, where Figure 1 is an exploded perspective view of the boot shell, front quarter, and instep presser Figure 2 illustrates in schematic form and in perspective the connection between the instep presser and front quarter Figure 3 shows the connection between the instep presser and the shell and Figure 4 is a perspective, partly cut away, view of this ski boot. With reference to the drawing views, a rear entrance ski boot according to this invention as generally indicated by the reference numeral 1 comprises a shell 2, front quarter 3, and rear quarter 4. In a known manner, the front quarter 3 is provided with levers or hooks, indicated at 5, for fastening the boot. The peculiar aspect of the invention resides in that the boot includes a foot instep presser 10, comprising a rigid element of anatomical shape which is positioned inside the shell at the foot instep region thereof. The presser 10 is associated at its lateral extremeties with the front quarter 3 through pins 11. Said pins 11 are accommodated slidably within slotted holes 12 formed at the side portions of said shell 2. The coupling heretofore described, affords therefore the ability of a1 mtneaisly tigltenig the presser 10 against the foot while the boot is being fastened, by acting solely on the levers 5. In fact,when fastening the boot, the pin 11 moves in the slot 12 and draws both the front quarter 3 and presser 10 towards the rear of the boot. At the mid upper portion, there is provided a center pin 20 associated with the shell 2, which engages slidably with a first elongate slot 21 defined in the quarter and sub second elongate slot.22 defined in the presser. Thus, with the arrangement heretofore described, OM the skier closing the levers 5, the front quarter 3 is pulled to the rear along with the instep presser 10 to effect the desired locking action. The coupling disclosed enables the front quarter to translate relatively to the boot in a direction corresponding to the longitudinal direction of development of the boot. Advantageously, the cited slot 12 has its rear end sloping upwards such that, during the translation phase, 8aOiticn to a component prevailing in a substantially horizontal direction there also occurs a component prevailing in a vertical direction to better fit the normal anatomy of the skiers leg. It may be appreciated from the foregoing that the invention achieves its objects, and the fact is to be particularly emphasised, that this arrangement enables, with a single actuation movement, i.e. by merely operating the fastening levers, both a conventional fastening of the boot and simultaneous locking of the foot instep. Furthermore, the novel type of connection between front quarter and shell, owing to the fact that the front quarter, additionally to being oscillable relatively to the shell, also has translation capabilities, albeit of a limited order, affords a more effective locking action of the skier s leg inside the boot. The invention as disclosed is susceptible to many modifications and changes without departing from the purview of the inventive concept. Further, all of the details may be replaced with other, technically equivalent elements. In practicing the invention, any materials, dimensions, and contingent shapes, may be selected and used to meet individual requirements, providing they are compatible with the intended application.
