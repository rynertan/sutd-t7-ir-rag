# Process for oxidizing aldehydes to carboxylic acids.

## Abstract
Carboxylic acids having the general formula R COOH wherein R is selected from aryl, aralkyl, aralkenyl, aralkynyl, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, heteroarylalkenyl, heteroarylal kynyl, alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl groups, optionally substituted by substituents inert under the reaction conditions, are ob tained by oxidation of the corresponding aldehydes with an al kali metal or alkaline earth metal chlorite in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and in an aqueous organic solvent. The re sulting carboxylic acids are utilizable as intermediates for pre paring fine chemicals.
