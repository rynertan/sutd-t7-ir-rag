# VELOCITY SERVO CONTROLLER

## Abstract
A motor compensation network for use with a two degree of freedom velocity servo controller includes first and second compensation means. The first compensation means receives a signal representing a difference between a velocity command signal and a velocity feedback signal and provides a modified output signal. The second com pensation means receives the velocity feedback signal and provides a modified output signal. Bandwidth adjustment means are coupled to the first and second compensation means. Damping factor adjustment means are coupled to the second compensation means. The transfer function of the first compensation means has characteristics of an inte grator. The transfer function of the second compensation means has a first and a second component. The first com ponent has characteristics of a differentiator, while the second component has characteristics of a proportionality or a gain constant. The bandwidth adjustment means varies the gain or scale factor of the integrator of the first com pensation means and the gain or scale factor of the differen tiator of the second compensation means according to a predetermined relationship. The damping factor adjustment means varies the gain of the proportionality constant of the second compensation means. The gain of the differentiator is maintained equal to a reciprocal of the gain of the integra tor as bandwidth is adjusted, thereby keeping the bandwidth adjustment and damping factor adjustments independent from one another.
