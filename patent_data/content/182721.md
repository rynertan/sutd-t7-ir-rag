A case for a tape cassette having an opening 5 on at least one side thereof to enable inserting the tape cassette T characterized by a plurality of line like projections 2, 3 extending parallel to each other being provided on at least one of the inner or outer surfaces of the case C . The provi sion of the projections 2 on the outer surface increases the friction of the surface to enable easier gripping of the case C and to prevent slipping of the case C when placed in a stack and the provision of the projections 3 on an inner surface helps to prevent unsightly scratches from being made while inserting and removing the tape cassette T from the case C .
