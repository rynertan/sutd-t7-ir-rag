# VESSEL HAVING DEMOUNTABLE SUBMERGED PROPELLER UNIT

## Abstract
The invention concerns a hull and a submerged propeller unit 22 demountably fitted to the hull and continuously rotat able through 360 of azimuth relative to the hull to give full thrust in any required direction. An aperture in the hull is sur rounded by a fixing flange 29 to which extend a drive input shaft 12 for the propeller unit 22 and at least one steering drive shaft 62 . At least one steering drive motor 64 is mounted in the vessel and is connected to the steering drive shaft 62 to effect rotation thereof. A gearbox casing 31,32 of the propeller unit fits in the aperture with a circumferential flange 34 releasably bolted 35 to the fixing flange 29 . A stem 42,45 depends from said casing and is rotatably sup ported therein at its upper end to act as a steering tube for a pro peller 22 rotatably supported at its lower end. A steering gear wheel 55 in said casing 31, 32 through which the stem 42 passes and to which it is secured effects rotation thereof. Steering drive gear means 56 rotatably supported in said cas ing 31,32 in mesh with the steering drive wheel 55 is releas ably connected to said steering drive shaft 62 so that opera ton of said steering motor 64 rotates the propeller unit 22 . A drive transmission shaft 16 for the propeller 22 extends through the stem 42,45 is releasably connected at its upper end to the main drive shaft 12 whereby when the propeller unit 22 is dismounted from the vessel the steering gear wheel 55 and the gear means 56 are removed in the casing 31, 32 as part of the demountable propeller unit 22 .
