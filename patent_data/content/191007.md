# METHOD AND DEVICE FOR GAS CONDITIONING

## Abstract
Method and device for conditioning a gas such as air, wherein the gas is cooled by means of a cooling circuit for dehydration of the gas by evaporation of a refrigerant in the evaporator 16 of the cooling circuit. The gas is conducted also through a treatment zone in a regenerative exchanger apparatus, in which moisture is delivered to a moisture absorbing drying agent. The cooling circuit comprises in addition to the evaporator 16 a compressor 26 and a condenser 24 . The cooling circuit is regulated as to its effect so that the greatest cooling and dehydration effect is obtained without any formation of ice on the evaporator taking place.
