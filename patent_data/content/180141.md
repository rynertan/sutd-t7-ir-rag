# Process for making diene polymer rubbers.

## Abstract
A process for making a diene polymer rubber which com prises reacting an active diene polymer rubber having alkali metal and or alkaline earth metal terminals, which is obtained by polymerizing a conjugated diene monomer alone or to gether with an aromatic vinyl monomer in a hydrocarbon sol vent, using an alkali metal and or alkaline earth metal initiator, with 1 a tin compound expressed by the general formula R
