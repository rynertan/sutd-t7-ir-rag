## Description
IMPROVED VEHICLE RESIDENTIAL BATTERY ACCESS SYSTEM The present invention relates in general to access.and utilization systems for electrical power supply systems and equipment, and in particular to an improved access and utilization system for permanent or emergency connection of external power sources or loads, including the home power distribution wiring system, to the storage battery electtrical system of an automobile. Modern automobiles, vehicles, and many stationary power sources commonly utilize electrical systems to start the respective engines and to operate other associated equipment. These electrical systems generally rely upon and utilize storage batteries to supply the necessary electric current. Although such systems are generally reliable, it is often necessary or desirable to supply electrical current to the system from an external source to supplement the output of the storage battery, such as when the storage battery is in a discharged or depleted condition. Conversely, it is desiraule to be able to supply electric current from the automotive system to other such systems which may be similarly depleted. Many homes today rely extensively upon an uninterrupted supply of electricity in order to maintain indispen sible functions of modern life. For example, electric sump pumps are often required to prevent flooding or foundation erosion, particularly during heavy rainstorms. Further, iflarni homes utilize gas, oil or other types of forced air or circulated hot water heating systems. Although the requisite combustible material may be available to such furnaces during power outages, electricity is still needed to run the various fan motors, pumps and electrical relays which are necessary for such heating systems to operate. Therefore, it is desirable to be able to energize the home electrical distribution system during periods of power outage to maintain such functions, and is desirable to utilize the available potential of the automotive electrical system to provide such electrification. An appropriate access, connection and conversion system is thus required. In addition to the foregoing, it is also often convenient and desirable to be able to readily insert or remove the storage battery from an associated automobile electrical system. For example, discharged batteries may be removed for recharging and then reinstalled, or may be exchanged for previously charged batteries, thereby insuring that the automobile s power system will be in top readiness for uses as descrioed above. There are many dangers and difficulties associated with performing the aforementioned tasks of accessing, connec ting to, and utilizing the storage battery electrical system of a vehicle. Because very high currents may typically be s involved, it is necessary to insure that electrical connec tions are secure. Further, sparks often result when such connections are made, and these sparks may ignite hydrogen gas and other flammable vapors or fluids associated with an autoinobile s storage battery and engine. In addition, modern vehicles typically employ electronic and other electrical equipment wnich may be seriously damaged if electrical current of improper voltage polarity is attached.Further, typical metnods of connecting storage batteries to automotive systems and to external devices are cumbersome, difficult to apply or remove, and prone to corrosion. Therefore, it is desirable to have a system which will permit secure and corrision free access to a vehicle s electrical system, will minimize the danger of incorrect polarity of connection, will permit rapid, secure and corrosion free connection to the storage battery, and will permit such advantageous connections to be made quickly, even under adverse conditions. Previous devices have attempted to provide some of the aforementioned qualities. Among these are Applicant s prior patent, U.S. Pat. No. 4,157,592 issued June 5, 1979. However, sucn devices have not completely or adequately pro vided all of the desirable functions or qualities. The pre sent invention provides such an an improved and useful system. The advantages offered by the present invention are that tne system described provides the necessary safety and protection against short circuits and incorrect voltage polar ity, by insuring that only proper connections can be effected, or by informing the operator when incorrect connections are made in a manner best designed to draw the potentially dangerous condition to the attention of the operator. Further safety is achieved by providing a system that permits such access to an automotive power system to be made external to the engine compartment of the automobile. Convenience is enhanced by providing a system which may be permanently attached to the automotive electrical system and stored within the engine compartment, whereby it is always available for unexpected emergency use. Finally, flexibility is achieved by providing a system which is amenable to supplying electrical current to a diversity of external loads, includiny the ability to energize a home electrical distribution wiring system for emergency maintenance of essential functions.These and other objects and advantages of the invention shall be apparent in light of the present specification. The resulting system includes a first electrical cable assembly which is designed to be permanently or semipermanently attached to the electrical system of a first auto mobile, a second cable assembly designed for attachment of an external load to the first vehicle s electrical system, and a connecting adapter designed to permit these two cable assemblies to be electrically joined. In order to insure that correct voltage polarity is maintained in such connections, the male plugs associated with the cable assemblies are geometrically polarized such that they .,lay cooperate with the female sockets of the connecting adapter in one physical and electrical orientation only. The connecting adapter in the preferred embodiment incluaes a multiplicity of female sockets designed to cooperate with the male plugs, wherein the respective electrical contacts of tile female sockets are electrically connected so that a male plug inserted into one of the multiplicity of female sockets is thereby electrically connected in proper polarity to a similar male plug inserted into another of the multiplicity of sockets. In order to warn the operator when an accidental situation of incorrect voltage polarity exists with respect to the second cable assembly, the present invention further includes a polarity indicator. In the preferred embodiment, this indicator provides audio or visual warning when the second cable assembly has been incorrectly attached. Further, the present invention provides such polarity indicator within the housing of the male plug itself. This is important for tne access system will be advantageously utilized by making the connection between any two electrical systems by the final act of plugging the male plug of one system into the male plug and connecting adapter combination of a second system. There fore, inclusion of the polarity indicator into the male plug assures that the warning will be delivered most directly to the operator prior to the final connection being made, thereby maximizing the probability that such warning will be noted. In another embodiment of the present invention, the aforementioned connection to the storage battery or electrical system of the automobile is accomplished by attaching the male plug of the access system directly to the battery itself by means of a female socket which is integral to the storage battery. Such a female socket may be attached to or may be molded integrally into the case of such a storage battery, with the electrical contacts of such socket being internally connected to the power bus of the battery so as to provide direct access to the battery s electrical capacity. Such a uattery may further include alternative standard top or side amounted binding posts or, in the preferred embodiment, may include a multiplicity of such integral female sockets.Further, in one embodiment, a first cable assembly attached to tne automobile electrical system may be utilized in conJunction with one of the multiplicity of female sockets to provide the requisite electrical connection of the storage battery to the automobile electrical system, thereby perwitting rapid and corrosion free plugwise connection of the storage Dattery to the automobile, facilitating the installation and removal of the battery. The second cable assembly of the present invention may be utilized to attach many forms of external loads to the automotive system. In one embodiment, spring biased clamps are provided to permit temporary connection to other vehicle electrical systems which are not equipped with a corresponding battery access system, such as for jump starting. Alternatively, emergency lighting or other electrical equipment may De connected directly to the second cable assembly. In another embodiment, such external equipment includes an electrical converter for converting the electrical output of the the vehicle, which is generally a direct current, to a second electrical power output which may be of an elevated voltage alternating current, such as that typically supplied to the home by power utilities for operation of lighting equipment and appliances. In this manner, the battery access and utilization system may be used to supply standard electrical power to remote locations, or may be used to supply emergency power for the operation of necessary equipment to the home during periods of utility power outage.In relation to such emergency home use, standard or specialized connectors may be used to permit connection of the converter directly to the home power distribution wiring system, whereby the home distribution system is energized, thereby supplying and distributing necessary electrical power to the appropriate appliances and equipment. One way of carrying out the invention is described in detail below with reference to the drawings which illus trate only certain specific embodiments, in which Fig. 1 is an exploded elevational view of one embodiment of the battery access system, showing particularly tne relationship between the male plugs and the female adapter Fig. 2 is a schematic representation of a typical application of the present invention for interconnection of the electrical systems of two automobiles Fig. 3 is a cross sectional view of the preferred embodiment of the female adapter Fig. 4 of the drawings is an exploded view of a repsesentative system incorporating an integrated storage battery and female socket unit, an appropriate male plug cable assembly for connecting the battery to a first automobile electrical system, an electrical extension for connecting the cattery to external devices, and corresponding caps for sealing and protecting the electrical plugs and sockets Fig. 5 is an exploded elevational view of another embodiment of the invention illustating use of a converter means Fig. 6 is a side elevational view of another embodiment of the system with converter means comprising an electric rotor coupled to an electric generating means, and further illustrating alternative output connection apparatus and Fig. 7 is a schematic representation of another emoodiment of the converter means, namely a relaxation oscillator circuit.
