# Permanent magnet DC motor with magnets recessed into motor frame.

## Abstract
A motor frame and stator assembly 20 , 27 , for a permanent magnet direct current motor is shown which is characterized by accommodating a larger and more powerful armature 12 relative to the interior and exterior dimensions of the frame 20 . The assembly 20 , 27 includes a metal frame 20 having a pre determined length and continuous walls the inner surface of which define a void 24 . A plurality of arcuate, recessed seats 25 is formed into the inner walls of the frame 20 in spaced apart intervals around and extending along at least a part of the length of the frame 20 . The walls of the frame 20 along the extent of the seats 25 are of reduced cross sectional thickness. A plurality of permanent magnets 27 having a convex and concave side are mounted by the convex side against one of the plurality of seats 25 . A permanant magnet DC motor 10 con structed of one or more metal frame modules 20 is also disclosed.
