# Test fluid preparation apparatus.

## Abstract
An injection type test fluid preparation apparatus has a syringe 1 and a nozzle 7 which are adapted to inject a required amount of a sample of a corpuscular blood specimen 10 into a measuring tube 9 and to control an amount of a diluent 13 to be added thereto by injection through a nozzle 16 by means of a pump 11 while detecting concentration of the test fluid 20 in the measuring tube 9 which contains the required amount of the sample and the diluent added to the sample, so that a desired concentration of the test fluid can be obtained. The syringe 1 and the pump 11 are controlled by a central processing unit 23 to which the reference information is fed from a keyboard 24 and which receives the output of a detector 22 upon which light transmitted through the test fluid 20 being diluted falls. The nozzle 7 is cleaned by a washing fluid 28 by means of a pump 27 which feeds the latter via valves Aâ‚‚ to the interior of the nozzle 7 and to spray nozzles 32 .
