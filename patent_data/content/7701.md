# Electromagnetic shielding envelopes from wound glassy metal filaments.

## Abstract
Efficient electromagnetic shielding envelopes made of wound metallic glass filaments are disclosed. They are made by winding the filaments around a suitably shaped mandrel and embedding the filaments in a matrix. These shielding envelopes have high shielding ratios at low magnetic fields and are easily manufactured.
