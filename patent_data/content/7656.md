# Process for the continuous thermal cracking of hydrocarbon oils and hydrocarbon mixtures thus prepared.

## Abstract
A process for the continuous thermal cracking of hyd rocarbon oils, which comprises preheating 2 the hydrocar bon oil feed 1 and causing the hot feed to flow upwards through a soaking vessel 4 in which the feed has an average residence time between 5 min. and 60 min. In order to achieve a good residence time distribution of the hydrocarbon oil feed, the soaking vessel comprises at least 2 mixing stages. To obtain the desired amount of mixing stages internals, prefer ably perforated plates 5 , are installed in the soaking vessel. In this way more stable cracked residues are obtained.
