# Array processor comprised of vector processors using vector registers.

## Abstract
Herein disclosed is an array processor which is constructed of a central vector processing unit VPC including a plurality of vector registers and a pipe line control arithmetic and logical operation unit ALU and made operative to execute instruction vector instruction requiring processings of vectors and a plurality of vector processing units PE1 PEM including a plurality of vector registers V1 VK and a pipe line control ALU made operative to execute an instruction array instruction requiring processings of arrays. The central vector processing unit VPC fetches and decodes the vector instruction or the array instruction to execute the decoded instruction, when this instruction is the vector instruction but to start those vector processing units, when the decoded instruction is the array instruction. Each of the vector processing units PE1 PEM executes that operation to one of plural vector data comprising array data to be an object of the operation designated by the decoded instruction, which is designated by the instruction for one of the vector data, when the decoded instruction is the array instruction. When the result of the operation designated by the array instruction is tne vector data, each of the vector processing units computes and stores one element of those vector data in built in scala registers, and sends out that element to the central vector processing unit VPC so that the element may be stored in vector registers in the central vector processing unit. When the result of the operation designated by the array instruction is the array data, each of the vector processing units PE1 PEM computes and stores one vector data of those resultant array data in built in vector registers V1 VK .
