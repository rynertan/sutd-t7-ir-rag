## Description
Title Security Container This invention relates to a security container for holding articles of value such as money and jewels. Security containers specifically for use in holding money, i.e. cash boxes, have for many years been based on a standard design, namely a body of generally box like form, the box affording one side of an opening which is closed by a lid hinged to one edge of the body, a carrying handle mounted centrally on the lid, the carrying handle being made from metal rod and being pivotally connected to the lid. Conventionally, the cash box is provided with a removable tray within the body, which tray has separate pockets for different sizes of coins and a key operated lock mechanism for locking the lid. Such cash boxes are not particularly elegant and not easy to carry about, particularly cash boxes of large size. To enable the box to be carried, it is first necessary to close and secure the lid and then carry the box by means of the handle which is pivoted to the lid. This known arrangement has two disadvantages. Firstly, it has been necessary for the cash box to be carried by a handle on the lid, in an opening uppermost orientation, because otherwise the coins inside will not be retained in the separate pockets but will be discharged from one packet into another. Secondly, when being carried, the cash box can swing about the handle. Thirdly, it is always necessary to lock the lid onto the body even when carrying the cash box only short distances when great security is not required, because lifting the cash box by the handle tends to open the cash box and permit of the money inside falling out. An object of this invention is to provide a new or improved security container. According to the invention we provide a security container comprising a body having first and second rigid body parts, at least one of the body parts comprising an open mouthed tray having rigid side, end and base walls, said body parts being connected at adjacent edges by hinge means which permit of the body parts being relatively pivoted between an open condition wherein access may be gained to the interior of the tray or trays, and a closed condition wherein access cannot be gained to the interior of the tray or trays, each of the body parts having co operating means which, when said container is in said closed condition, provide at least one discrete cavity within the container, in which cavity or cavities an article or articles may be contained, at least one of the body parts having a handle portion whereby the container may be carried and the article or articles in said cavity or cavities is or are prevented from being discharged from said cavity or cavities during carriage by said cooperating means. Thus the container may be carried in any desired orientation depending on the disposition and configuration of the handle. For example, the handle may comprise an extension of one of said end walls in which case the container may be carried with said open mouth disposed in a vertical plane. Thus particularly where more than one cavity is provided, an article or articles, such as coin or jewellery, in one cavity will be prevented from being discharged from said one cavity, into another cavity by said co operating means and thus the coin or jewellery will not be mixed up. Preferably where the security container is a cashbox, preferably a member having a plurality of discrete pockets formed by rigid dividing walls, is provided in the first body part herein referred to as the base part the open mouths of the pockets being closed by means provided in the second body part herein referred to as the lid part when the body parts are pivoted together into said closed condition. Said means in the lid may in one embodiment be provided by a wallet part for banknotes and other paper secured in the lid part, and in another embodiment, a padded part. The security container may alternatively comprise a single cavity in a jewel box for example, said cavity being provided by a padded member in the base part which has a pocket therein which pocket is closed when the container is closed by a padded part in the lid part.Further, the padded member in the base part need not comprise a permanent pocket because when the jewellery or other article or articles is or are placed on a padded member and the lid part closed, the padded member will be deformed by the article to form a pocket which pocket is closed at the top by said means in the lid part to provide a discrete pocket. Preferably the first and second parts each have an integrally formed handle portion which provides part of the complete carrying handle when the container is in a closed condition, and more preferably, the first and second body parts are of similar configuration, each handle portion providing substantially half the complete handle. Thus the container may be held rigidly without the body swinging about the handle. The body may be generally symmetrical about the hinge axis, each body part having a substantially flat face which forms a side face of the body when the container is in a closed condition, the two side faces being in opposition whereby, when the container is in an open condition, one of said flat faces provide a flat base for the open container to rest on a flat surface. For example, the first and second parts of the body may each be in the form of a rectangular open mouthed tray with a substantially flat base wall and parallel side walls and end walls with an extension formed on one of the side or end walls to provide a handle portion, the two handle portions of the two body parts being substantially similar and complementary, so that when the container is in a closed condition, the two handle portions combine to form a complete carrying handle which is rigid with the closed body and extends from one side or end of the body, preferably, one end of the body. In a preferred embodiment, the handle portions are each provided on the end of the body opposite the hinge. The container preferably has a lock which permits the first and second body parts to be locked in said closed condition. Preferably the lock is provided on one of said body parts and has a part which extends through the other body part. Where the handle is provided on the end opposite the hinge, the lock is conveniently provided on the handle portion or portions to lock the parts together. Thus, when the cashbox is carried, the lock is concealed by the hand of the user extending through the handle. Further, the container may conveniently be made as a pressing in sheet material to provide said rigid body part. It will be appreciated that, especially where the handle is provided on the end opposite to the hinge, that when the container is carried by the handle, the body parts do not tend to move apart to open the security container as is the case with known cash boxes. Thus it is not necessary to actuate the lock each time it is required to carry the security container, where great security is not required, as the article or articles in the container are securely retained in the container in the respective cavity or cavities. The invention will now be described with the aid of the accompanying drawings, in which FIGURE 1 is a perspective view showing a cash box in an open condition FIGURE 2 is a fragmentary section on the line 2 2 ofFigure 1 FIGURE 3 is a perspective view of the cash box ofFigures 1 and 2 in a closed condition. Referring to the drawings, there is shown a security container comprising a cash box having a body, the complete body being made in two substantially similar rigid body parts indicated generally at 10 and 11. As seen in Figure 1, one part 11 is resting on a flat surface F and part 10 is in a raised position so that the cash box is open and hereinafter simply for ease of terminology the part 10 will be referred to as the lid and the part 11 will be termed the base.. The two parts 10, 11 are generally similar in configuration and in particular the lid 10 has a flat face 12 providing a base wall and the base 11 also has a flat face 13 also providing a base wall, the faces 12 and 13 being in opposition in the closed condition of the cash box shown in Figure 3. The lid 10 has parallel side walls 14 and the base 11 has similar opposed parallel side walls 15. The lid 10 has an end wall 16 and the base 11 has a corresponding end wall 17, the two body parts 10, 11 being hinged together about a hinge axis 18 at the two end walls 16 and 17. At its end opposite the end wall 16 the lid 10 is extended to provide a handle portion 19 and similarly the base 11 is extended at the end opposite the end wall 17 to provide a handle portion 20 of corresponding configuration. The handle portion 19 of the lid 10 has a substantially rectangular opening 21 which is surrounded by an inwardly extending lip 22. Similarly the handle portion 20 of the base 11 has a generally rectangular opening 23 of the same shape and configuration as the opening 21, and also surrounded by an inwardly extending lip 24. In the closed condition of the cash box as shown inFigure 3, the two openings 21 and 23 are aligned and also the inwardly presented lips 22 and 24 register to form a complete handle H with an opening from one side to the other of sufficient size to allow the fingers of a hand of the user of a cash box to be passed through, for the purpose of carrying the cash box. The lid 10 and the base 11 are preferably each made as pressings in steel sheet material, although other suitable materials and methods of manufacture may be used as appropriate. Thus the cash box provides a strong rigid security container having rigid base 11 and lid 10 body parts. As shown in Figure 1, the base 11. has along the upper peripheral edge 25, an inwardly stepped flange 25a and, when the cash box is in the closed position, the side walls 14 and handle portion 19 of the lid 10 close over the flange 25a to locate the lid 10 in rigid engagement with the base 11. A key operated cylinder lock 26 or other type of lock is fitted in the handle portion 20 of the base 11, an aperture 27 being provided in the handle portion 19 of the lid 10 in which the cylinder lock 26 is received when the lid and base parts 10, 11 are closed together. Thus a key can be inserted through the aperture 27 to operate the lock 26. An inwardly projecting lug 28 is provided on the handle portion 19 which passes through a corresponding slot 29 alongside the cylinder lock 26 in the handle portion 20 of the base 11, the lug 28 being engageable by a catch of the cylinder lock 26 and thus no separate latch mechanism is required as with conventional cash boxes in use at present. Where great security is not required, the cash box may be provided only with lug 28 and the catch, the lock 26 being omitted in which case, the aperture 27 in the lid 10 would not be necessary. In the embodiment shown, the base 11 is provided with a removable coin tray generally indicated at 30 which may conveniently be made as a moulding in plastics material and which is provided with a number of separate pockets 31, 32 for containing coins of different nominations. At one end, the tray 30 is extended to surround the lip 24 of the handle portion 20 and the tray 30 is made as a snug fit within the base 11 so that it can be easily removed if required. For the retention of bank notes, petty cash vouchers and like paper, there is provided in the lid 10 a wallet generally indicated at 34 which has a plurality of compartments defined by partition members 35 which extend upwardly from a base portion 36 and a detachable connection with the lid 10 so that the wallet 34 can be removed as required. The detachable connection shown in Figure 2 comprises a U shaped stirrup 37 which engages frictionally over a lip 38 extending from the end wall 16 of the lid 10 although any other form of detachable connection may be provided. The wallet 34 may be made from suitable plastics or like sheet material, or may be fabricated from metal. When the security container is in a closed condition, it will be appreciated that the pockets 31 in the tray 30 will be closed by the wallet 34 to form discrete cavities so that coins are not discharged from one cavity into another when the container is carried.Further, as the tray 30 surrounds the lip 24, coins cannot fall out of the box through the opening 23. If desired, a security container in accordance with the invention need not comprise a cash box for holding money but may comprise a security container for holding other valuables. Accordingly, a different type of tray 30 may be provided. For example, where the security container is intended for holding jewels, the tray 30 may instead comprise a padded lining, a similar padded lining being provided within the lid 10, which linings come together when the container is closed to provide one or more cavities to prevent the jewels moving within the container. Further, the container need not be of the configuration described but may be of any other configuration wherein a handle portion is provided integrally with the body. It will be apparent from Figure 3, which shows the cash box described above in a closed condition, that a security container in accordance with the invention not only provides an elegant outward appearance but is more easily carried by virtue of the handle H than is the case with a conventional cash box which has to be carried by a small handle made from metal rod and pivotally connected to the top face of the lid of a conventional cash box. Also with the conventional cash box, it is generally necessary to close and lock the lid every time it is required to carry the box by the handle even when moving a short distance and not under conditions of security.However, with a security container according to the present invention, if it is required to carry the container only a short distance not under conditions of security, it is only necessary to close the two parts together and there is no need to operate the lock because the grasping of the handle and engagement of the catch and lug 28, if provided, keeps the two parts in a closed condition. Thus the invention provides a more easily made, more convenient and attractive security container than known cash boxes.
