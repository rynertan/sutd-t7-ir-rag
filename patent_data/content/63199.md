# Fuel cell stack arrangements.

## Abstract
Arrangements of stacks of fuel cells 10 and ducts 70, 74 , for fuel cells operating with separate fuel, oxidant and coolant streams. An even number of stacks are arranged generally end to end in a loop. Ducts 70, 74 located at the juncture of consecutive stacks of the loop feed oxidant or fuel to or from the two consecutive stacks, each individual duct communicating with two stacks. A coolant fluid flows from outside the loop, into and through cooling channels of the stack, and is discharged into an enclosure duct 58 formed within the loop by the stacks and seals at the junctures at the stacks.
