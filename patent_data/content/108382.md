# Hydrazine derivatives of phthalides and furopyridinones, methods for making and for using said compounds.

## Abstract
This invention relates to mono and bis aryl and or heteroaryl substituted phthalazinones, phthalimidines, pyri dopyridazinones and pyrrolopyridinones useful as color forming substances, particularly in electrochromic recording systems, which are prepared by the interaction of a mono or bis substituted phthalide or furopyridinone with a substitu ted or unsubstituted hydrazine.
