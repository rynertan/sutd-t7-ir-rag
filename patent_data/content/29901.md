# Lithographic resist composition for use in a method of forming a film on a substrate.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a lithographic resist composition for use in a method of forming a film 17 on a substrate 11 comprising the steps of providing a deposition mask 10 of the resist composition on the substrate 11 , exposing a selected portion of the mask to ultra violet rays, dissolving the exposed portion with aqueous alkali to form an aperture 15 with negative slope or overhang, depositing on said substrate 11 through the aperture 15 said film 17 and removing the deposition mask 10 . The resist composition comprises a phenolic aldehyde resin, a photosensitizer and Meldrum s diazo, or Meldrum s acid or suitable analogs thereof as a profile modifying agent. The profile modifying agents useful in the present invention have the formula
