# Process for selectively reinking used thermal transfer printing ribbon and method for making a colloidal dispersion for use in said process.

## Abstract
The process for selectively reinking used thermal transfer printing ribbons comprises the stationary or moving expos ure of the ribbon to a pigment containing polymeric colloidal dispersion of electrophoretically depositable ink, and passing an electric current through said colloidal dispersion, with an electrically conductive layer of said ribbon serving as one electrode, to electrophoretically deposit the said colloidal dis persion on areas of said ribbon that have been depleted of ink in a previous printing operation, to form a continuous ink layer of uniform The method of making said colloidal dispersion involves heating a water insoluble polymeric binder to a liquid state, blending a pigment into the melted polymeric binder, blend ing a heated dilute aqueous solution of a carboxylic acid into the foregoing, then blending a colloid charge forming com pound to the composition, and cooling the dispersion so formed.
