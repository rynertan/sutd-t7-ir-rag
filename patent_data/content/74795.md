# IMAGE SCANNING APPARATUS AND METHOD

## Abstract
Scanning apparatus having at least one self scanned array 10 , together with processors 38, 39, 40 for proces sing line, halftone or continuous tone images. A multi speed transport 24, 25 carries documents 18 to be scanned past a scanning slit 14 where the moving document is scanned line by line by the array 12 . Normally, scanning is carried out in high speed on the assumption that most documents are composed of lines or text and the resulting image signals processed by the line processor. During scanning, halftone and continuous tone detectors look for halftone and con tinuous tone images. Where halftone is found, the line is immediately rescanned at low speed and the image signals processed by the halftone processor 39 . Thereafter, the apparatus reverts to high speed scanning. Where continuous tone images are found, the document page is rescanned at low speed with the image signals output by the scanning array processed by a continous tone processor 40 . To enhance operation, sub sampling of the document page may be employed on the first high speed scanning pass.
