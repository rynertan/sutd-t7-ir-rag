# A method of measuring the dispersion of a transmitting optical fibre.

## Abstract
A method of measuring mode dispersion in a transmit ting optical fibre for transferring light singles representing digital information coded according to a binary line code. The clock signal amplitude is first measured in the system re ceiver with the pertinent transmission fibre connected and thereafter with the system loop connected. The dispersion can be calculated from both measured amplitude values.
