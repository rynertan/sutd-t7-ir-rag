The use of certain cyclohexane 1,3 dione derivatives as grass herbicides is known in the art. For example, the Pesticide Manual C R Worthing Editor, The British Crop Protection Council, 6th Edition 1979 describes the cyclohexane 1,3 dione derivative known commercially as alloxydim sodium methyl 3 1 allyloxyimino butyl 4 hydroxy 6,6 dimethyl 2 oxocyclohex 3 ene carboxylate and its use as a grass herbicide. This compound is disclosed in Australian Patent No 464 655 and its equivalents such as UK Patent No 1 461 170 and US Patent No 3 950 420.

Conveniently the preparation of the compounds of the invention can be considered in four or five parts. Part A involves the formation of a 5 arylcyclohexan 1,3 dione of formula IX. This reaction may be carried out in a two step process by Part B involves reaction of a 5 arylcyclohexan 1,3 dione of formula IX with an acidic dehydrating agent to give a derivative of formula X. Suitable dehydrating agents include polyphosphoric acid and methanesulfonic acid.

The acylation reaction may be carried out by reacting a derivative of formula X with Part D involves the formation of a compound of the invention of formula I wherein R¹ is hydrogen, that is a compound of formula II. This reaction may be carried out either by reacting a 2 acyl 5 arylcyclohexane 1,3 dione derivative of formula XIV with Part E involves the formation of a compound of the invention of formula I where R¹ is a substituent other than hydrogen. Compounds of the invention of formula I, wherein R¹ forms an acyl or sulfonyl derivative of a compound of formula II, may be prepared from the corresponding compounds of the invention of formula II by reacting with an acylation or sulfonylation reagent of formula XXI. Compounds of the invention of formula I wherein R¹ is an inorganic or organic cation may be prepared from the compounds of the invention of formula I wherein R¹ is hydrogen, that is, compounds of formula II, by reacting said compounds of formula II with an inorganic or organic salt. For example, the compounds of formula I wherein R¹ is an alkali metal ion may be prepared by reacting the appropriate compound of formula II with the appropriate alkali metal hydroxide or alkoxylate. The compounds of formula I wherein R¹ is a transition metal ion or an organic cation may similarly be prepared by reacting the appropriate compound of formula II with an appropriate transition metal salt or organic base. Alternatively, the compounds of formula I wherein R¹ is a transition metal ion or an organic cation may be prepared by reacting the appropriate compound of formula I wherein R¹ is an alkali metal ion with an appropriate transition metal salt or organic salt. Accordingly, in a further aspect the invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula I, as hereinbefore defined, which process comprises reacting 2 acyl 5 arylcyclohexane 1,3 dione derivative of formula XIV with an alkoxyamine derivative of formula XVIII to give a compound of the invention of formula II or reacting the 2 acyl 5 arylcyclohexane 1,3 dione derivative of formula XIV with hydroxylamine and alkylating the oxime intermediate of formula XIX with an alkylating agent of formula XX, wherein L is a leaving group, to give a compound of the invention of formula II and optionally reacting the compound of the invention of formula II with a compound of formula XXI wherein L is a leaving group, to give a compound of the invention of formula I. Certain of the intermediate compounds of formulae VI, VIII, IX, X, XIV, XVII and XIX are novel compounds and therefore in further embodiments the invention provides novel compounds of formulae VI, VIII, IX, X, XIV, XVII and XIX and processes for the preparation thereof. It is not possible to use standard methods such as the Vilsmeier formylation or dichloromethyl methyl ether to prepare formylindanones or formyltetralones which would be the expected starting materials for the preparation of the cyclohexan 1,3 diones of formula X. It was necessary to find a means of forming the indanone or tetralone ring system after the cyclohexane 1,3 dione ring formation. Accordingly, in a further aspect the invention provides a process for the preparation of 5 1 oxoindanyl and 5 1 oxotetrahydronaphthyl cyclohexan 1,3 dione derivatives of formula X, which process comprises reacting a 5 carboxyalkyl phenyl cyclohexan 1,3 dione of formula IX with an acidic dehydrating agent. The structures of the compounds described above are detailed on the following pages wherein represents the group. The compounds of formula I are active as herbicides and therefore, in a further aspect the invention provides a process for severely damaging or killing unwanted plants which process comprises applying to the plants, or to the growth medium of the plants, an effective amount of a compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined. Generally speaking the compounds of formula I are selectively active against monocotyledonous plants, dicotyledonous plants being relatively unaffected by rates of application of the compounds of the invention which are severely damaging or lethal to other plant species. Moreover, certain of the compounds of formula I are selectively active within the group of monocotyledonous plants and may be used at a rate sufficient to control monocotyledonous weeds in cultivated crops, especially wild grasses in cereal crops. Certain of such compounds of the invention are especially useful in the control of wild grasses such as wild oats and rye grass in crops of cultivated monocotyledonous plants such as wheat, barley and other varieties of cereals. Accordingly, in yet a further aspect the invention provides a process for controlling monocotyledonous weeds in cultivated crops, especially wild grasses in cereal crops such as wheat, which process comprises applying to the crop, or to the growth medium of the crop, a compound of formula I, as hereinbefore defined, in an amount sufficient to severely damage or kill the weeds but insufficient to damage the crop substantially. The compounds of formula I may be applied directly to the plant post emergence application or to the soil before the emergence of the plant pre emergence application . However, the compounds are, in general, more effective when applied to the plant post emergence. The compounds of formula I may be used on their own to inhibit the growth of, severely damage, or kill plants but are preferably used in the form of a composition comprising a compound of the invention in admixture with a carrier comprising a solid or liquid diluent. Therefore, in yet a further aspect the invention provides growth inhibiting, plant damaging, or plant killing compositions comprising a compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined and an inert carrier therefor. Certain of the compounds of formula I exhibit useful plant growth regulating activity. For example, while compounds of formula I are selectively active herbicides against wild grasses in crops of cultivated plants at some rates of application they exhibit plant growth regulating effects in said crops. Plant growth regulating effects may be manifested in a number of ways. For example, suppression of apical dominance, stimulation of auxiliary bud growth, stimulation of early flowering and seed formation, enhancement of flowering and increase in seed yield, stem thickening, stem shortening and tillering. Plant growth regulating effects shown in compounds of the invention may include, for example, tillering and stem shortening in crops such as wheat and barley. Accordingly in a still further aspect the invention provides a process for regulating the growth of a plant which process comprises applying to the plant, to the seed of the plant, or to the growth medium of the plant, an effective amount of a compound of formula I, as hereinbefore defined. To effect the plant growth regulating process of the present invention the compounds of formula I may be applied directly to the plant post emergence application or to the seed or soil before the emergence of the plant pre emergence application. The compounds of formula I may be used on their own to regulate the growth of plants but in general are preferably used in the form of a composition comprising a compound of the invention in admixture with a carrier comprising a solid or liquid diluent. Therefore, in a still further aspect the invention provides plant growth regulating compositions comprising a compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined and an inert carrier therefor. The compositions of the present invention may be in the form of solids, liquids or pastes. The compositions include both dilute compositions which are ready for immediate use and concentrated compositions which may require dilution before use. Therefore, the concentration of the active ingredient in the compositions of the present invention will vary depending on the types of formulation and whether the composition is ready for use such as, for example, a dust formulation or an aqueous emulsion or whether the composition is a concentrate such as, for example, an emulsifiable concentrate or a wettable powder, which is suitable for dilution before use. In general the compositions of the present invention comprise from 1 ppm to 99 by weight of active ingredient. The solid compositions may be in the form of powders, dusts, pellets, grains, and granules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with a solid diluent. Powders and dusts may be prepared by mixing or grinding the active ingredient with a solid carrier to give a finely divided composition. Granules, grains and pellets may be prepared by bonding the active ingredient to a solid carrier, for example, by coating or impregnating the preformed granular solid carrier with the active ingredient or by agglomeration techniques. Examples of solid carriers include mineral earths and clays such as, for example, kaolin, bentonite, kieselguhr, Fuller s earth, Attaclay, diatomaceous earth, bole, loess, talc, chalk, dolomite, limestone, lime, calcium carbonate, gypsum, calcium sulfate, pyrophyllite, silicic acid, silicates and silica gels fertilizers such as, for example, ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate and urea natural products of vegetable origin such as, for example, grain meals and flours, bark meals, wood meals, nutshell meals and cellulosic powders and synthetic polymeric materials such as, for example, ground or powdered plastics and resins. Alternatively, the solid compositions may be in the form of dispersible or wettable dusts, powders, granules or grains wherein the active ingredient and the solid carrier are combined with one or more surface active agents which act as wetting, emulsifying and or dispersing agents to facilitate the dispersion of the active ingredient in liquid. Examples of surface active agents include those of the cationic, anionic and non ionic type. Cationic surface active agents include quaternary ammonium compounds, for example, the long chain alkylammonium salts such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. Anionic surface active agents include soaps or the alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and ammonium salts of fatty acids the alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and ammonium salts of ligninsulfonic acid the alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and ammonium salts of arylsulfonic acids including the salts of naphthalenesulfonic acids such as butylnaphthalenesulfonic acids, the di and tri isopropylnaphthalenesulfonic acids, the salts of the condensation products of sulfonated naphthalene and naphthalene derivatives with formaldehyde, the salts of the condensation products of sulfonated naphthalene and naphthalene derivatives with phenol and formaldehyde, and the salts of alkylarylbenzenesulfonic acids such as dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid the alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and ammonium salts of the long chain mono esters of sulfuric acid or alkylsulfates such as laurylsulfate and the mono esters of sulfuric acid with fatty alcohol glycol ethers. Nonionic surface active agents include the condensation products of ethylene oxide with phenols and alkylphenols such as isooctylphenol, octylphenol and nonylphenol the condensation products of ethylene oxide with castor oil the partial esters derived from long chain fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monolaurate, and their condensation products with ethylene oxide ethylene oxide propylene oxide block copolymers lauryl alcohol polyglycol ether acetal and the lecithins. The liquid compositions may comprise a solution or dispersions of the active ingredient in a liquid carrier optionally containing one or more surface active agents which act as wetting, emulsifying and or dispersing agents. Examples of liquid carriers include water mineral oil fractions such as, for example, kerosene, solvent naphtha, petroleum, coal tar oils and aromatic petroleum fractions aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons such as, for example, paraffin, cyclohexane, toluene, the xylenes, tetrahydronaphthalene and alkylated naphthalenes alcohols such as, for example, methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, cyclohexanol and propylene glycol ketones such as, for example, cyclohexanone and isophorone and strongly polar organic solvents such as, for example, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, N methylpyrrolidone and sulfolane. A preferred liquid composition comprises an aqueous suspension, dispersion or emulsion of the active ingredient which is suitable for application by spraying, atomizing or watering. Such aqueous compostions are generally prepared by mixing concentrated compositions with water. Suitable concentrated compositions include emulsion concentrates, pastes, oil dispersions, aqueous suspensions and wettable powders. The concentrates are usually required to withstand storage for prolonged periods and after such storage to be capable of dilution with water to form aqueous preparations which remain homogeneous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional spray equipment. The concentrates conveniently contain from 10 to 99 , preferably 10 to 60 , by weight of active ingredient. Emulsion or emulsifiable concentrates are conveniently prepared by dissolving the active ingredient in an organic solvent containing one or more surface active agents and optionally an oil. Oil dispersions may be prepared by grinding together the active ingredient, a hydrocarbon oil, and one or more surface active agents. Aqueous suspension concentrates may conveniently be prepared by ball milling a mixture of the active agent and preferably at least one suspending agent. Suitable suspending agents include hydrophilic colloids such as, for example, poly N vinylpyrrolidone , sodium carboxymethylcellulose and the vegetable gums, gum acacia and gum tragacanth hydrated colloidal mineral silicates such as, for example, montmorillonite, beidellite, nontronite, hectorite, saponite, sauconite and bentonite other cellulose derivatives and poly vinyl alcohol . Wettable powder concentrates may conveniently be prepared by blending together the active ingredient, one or more surface active agents, one or more solid carriers and optionally one or more suspending agents and grinding the mixture to give a powder having the required particle size. The aqueous suspensions, dispersions or emulsions may be prepared from the concentrated compositions by mixing the concentrated compositions with water optionally containing surface active agents and or oils. It should be noted that the compounds of the invention of formula I wherein R¹ is hydrogen are acidic. Therefore, the compounds of formula I may be formulated and applied as the salts of organic or inorganic bases. In formulating and employing the compounds of formula I in the form of their salts either the salts per se, that is the compounds of formula I wherein R¹ is an inorganic or an organic cation, may be used in the formulation or the compounds of formula I wherein R¹ is hydrogen may be used in the formulation and the salts generated in situ by the use of the appropriate organic or inorganic base. The mode of application of the compositions of the invention will depend to a large extent on the type of composition used and the facilities available for its application. Solid compositions may be applied by dusting or any other suitable means for broadcasting or spreading the solid. Liquid compositions may be applied by spraying, atomizing, watering, introduction into the irrigation water, or any other suitable means for broadcasting or spreading the liquid. The rate of application of the compounds of the invention will depend on a number of factors including, for example, the compound chosen for use, the identity of the plants whose growth is to be inhibited the formulations selected for use and whether the compound is to be applied for foliage or root uptake. As a general guide, however, an application rate of from 0.005 to 20 kilograms per hectate is suitable while from 0.01 to 5.0 kilograms per hectare may be preferred. The compositions of the invention may comprise, in addition to one or more compounds of the invention, one or more compounds not of the invention but which possess biological activity. For example, as hereinbefore indicated the compounds of the invention are in general substantially more effective against monocotyledonous plants or grass species than against dicotyledonous plants or broad leaved species. As a result, in certain applications the herbicidal use of the compounds of the invention alone may not be sufficient to protect a crop. Accordingly in yet a still further embodiment the invention provides a herbicidal composition comprising a mixture of at least one herbicidal compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined with at least one other herbicide. The other herbicide may be any herbicide not having the formula I. It will generally be a herbicide having a complementary action. For example, one preferred class is of mixtures comprising a herbicide active against broad leaved weeds. A second preferred class is of mixtures comprising a contact herbicide. Example of useful complementary herbicides include Examples of useful contact herbicides include The invention is now illustrated by but in no way limited to the following example. 5 6,8 Dimethyl 7 methoxy 1 oxo 1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphth 5 yl 2 1 ethoxyimino propyl 3 hydroxycyclohex 2 en 1 one 6 5 5,7 Dimethyl 1 oxoindan 4 yl 2 1 ethoxyimino propyl cyclohexane 1,3 dione 7 and 5 5,7 dimethyl 1 oxoindan 6 yl 2 1 ethoxyimino propyl cyclohexane 1,3 dione 8 .
