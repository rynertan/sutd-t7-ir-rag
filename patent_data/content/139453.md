## Description
CROSSLINKED COATINGS FROM HIGH NITRILE RESINS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention The invention relates to a resilient, water borne, thermoplastic, low film forming temperature coating with a high nitrile content. More specifically this invention relates to a corrosion resistant polymeric coating employing a high proportionate amount of olefinic nitrile monomer and a difunctional monomer capable of subsequent crosslinking.Description of the Prior Art Coatings with a high nitrile content are known in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,329,401 teaches latex coatings derived from acrylonitrile and methyl acrylate grafted onto a rubbery polymer backbone. These coatings exhibited the properties normally associated with nitrile resins such as low oxygen and moisture permeability and good chemical resistance. Also known in the art are crosslinked resins and coatings derived from cresslinked resins. In these resins and coatings, the polymer chains are linked to parallel or adjacent chains by a monomer bonded to both polymer chains. Crosslinked resins and coatings are known for their hardness, toughness and permanence. An object of this invention is a coating with the barrier and chemical resistance properties associated with nitrile resin based coatings and the hardness, toughness and permanence attributed to crosslinked resins and coatings. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A coating comprising a crosslinked copolymer of 1 olefinically unsaturated nitrile, 2 an acrylate ester, 3 a monomer containing at least two carbon to carbon double bonds, such that one double bond will partake in an initial graft polymerization reaction and a second double bond will react in a subsequent reaction to crosslink the graft polymers and 4 a rubbery polymer of from 50 to 100 percent by weight of a conjugated diene monomer and from 0 to 50 percent by weight of at least one comonomer copolymerizable with the conjugated diene monomer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to water borne, high nitrile resinous coatings with excellent impact resistance, excellent barrier properties and low film forming temperatures. The coatings contain at least 10 percent by weight of polymerized olefinically unsaturated nitriles. More preferably the coating contains more than 50 percent by weight of polymerized olefinically unsaturated nitriles. Most preferably the coatings contain more than 65 percent by weight of polymerized olefinically unsaturate nitrile. The coating is comprised of several polymerized monomers grafted onto an elastomer. The coatings superior properties are derived from the ability of the graft polymer to crosslink. This ability to crosslink results from the incorporation into the grafted portion of the polymer a monomer containing two or more double bonds. One of the double bonds reacts in the initial polymerization reaction, permitting the monomer to become part of the polymer backbone. A second double bond remains unreacted and is thus available for the subsequent crosslinking reaction. Typically this subsequent crosslinking reaction is initiated after the graft polymer is applied to a substrate on which the coating is desired. Specifically, the coating compositions of the instant invention comprise crosslinked copolymers of 1 olefinically unsaturated nitrile monomers, 2 ester monomers, 3 monomers containing at least two double bonds, and 4 a rubbery polymer containing 50 to 100 percent by weight of a conjugated diene monomer and 0 to 50 percent by weight of at least one comonomer which, is copolymerizable with the conjugated diene monomer.These crosslinked coatings contain at least 10 percent by weight of a polymerized unsaturated nitrile. In a preferred embodiment the coating is a crosslinked copolymer of 1 approximately 50 to 95 percent by weight of at least one olefinically unsaturated nitrile, 2 approximately 2 to 45 percent by weight of an ester, 3 approximately 2 to 45 percent by weight of a monomer containing at least two double bonds, and 4 a rubbery polymer containing 50 to 100 percent of a conjugated diene monomer and 0 to 50 percent by weight of at least one other olefinically unsaturated monomer which is copolymerizable with the conjugated diene monomer such that the given percentages of 1 , 2 and 3 are based upon the combined weights of 1 , 2 and 3 and that the resulting coating contain approximately 2 to 25 parts of 4 per 100 parts of 1 , 2 and 3 . The olefinically unsaturated nitriles suitable for the present invention include the alpha,beta unsaturated mononitriles having the structure EMI4.1 where R is hydrogen, a lower alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a halogen. Such compounds include acrylonitrile, alpha chloro acrylonitrile, alpha flouro acrylonitrile, methacylonitrile, ethyacrylonitrile and the like. The most preferred olefinically unsaturated nitriles useful in the present invention are acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile and mixtures thereof. The esters of olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acids suitable for this invention include the acrylate esters having the structure EMI4.2 where R is hydrogen, an alkyl group having from 1 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or a halogen and R is an alkyl group having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms.

Most preferred are the lower acrylates such as methyl acrylate and ethyl acrylate. The doubly unsaturated monomers useful in the present invention contain at least two carbon to carbon double bonds, such that one double bond polymerizes in the initial polymerization reaction from which the polymer latex is derived and a second double bond participates in the subsequent crosslinking reaction.

The rubbery polymers used contain 50 to 100 percent by weight of conjugated diene monomer. Preferred conjugated dienes are butadiene and isoprene. The preformed rubbery polymer also contains 0 to 50 percent by weight of at least one unsaturated comonomer which is polymerizable with the conjugated diene. Representative of suitable unsaturated comonomers are styrene an alpha,beta unsaturated mononitrile having the structure EMI5.1 where R is as previously designated and an ester of an olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acid of the structure EMI6.1 where R and R are as previously designated. Typically these rubbery polymers are preformed and added to the monomer mixture as a latex. The amount of rubbery polymer in this latex is typically between 20 to 40 parts elastomer solids to between 60 to 80 parts water.The amount of rubbery polymer present in the reaction mixture at the beginning of the graft reaction can range between 2 and 25 parts of rubbery polymer solids basis per 100 parts of charged monomer. In addition to the olefinically unsaturated nitrile monomers, ester monomers and the monomers containing at least two double bonds and the rubbery polymer, the coatings of the instant invention may contain other olefinically unsaturated monomers which are copolymerizable with olefinically unsaturated nitriles. Representative of the other olefinically unsaturated monomers are vinyl esters, vinyls, ethers, alpha olefins, conjugated dienes, vinyl aromatic monomers, indene and the like. A method for preparing these tough, solvent resistant coatings comprises the steps of A preparing a stable polymer latex by polymerizing in an aqueous medium a mixture of 1 approximately 50 to 95 percent by weight of at least one olefinically unsaturated nitrile, 2 approximately 2 to 45 percent by weight of an ester of olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acid, 3 approximately 2 to 45 percent by weight of a doubly unsaturated monomer containing two or more carbon to carbon double bonds, where the given percentages of 1 , 2 and 3 are based upon the combined weights of 1 , 2 and 3 , with 4 from 2 to 25 parts per 100 parts of 1 , 2 and 3 of a rubbery polymer containing approximately 50 to 100 percent by weight of a conjugated diene monomer and 0 to 50 percent by weight of at least one other olefinically unsaturated monomer which is copolymerizable with the conjugated diene monomer B applying the latex of A to a substrate and C initiating the crosslinking reaction. In step A , the polymer latex is prepared in an aqueous medium in the presence of a suitable polymerization catalyst. This aqueous medium may also contain chain transfer agents, emulsifiers and other stability agents. The catalyst, usually required for satisfactory polymerization rate, may be any of those commonly employed for the polymerization of nitrile or acrylate esters including the various peroxygen compounds such as hydrogen peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, pelargonyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, tertiary butyl hydroperoxide, tertiary butyl diperphthalate. tertiary butyl perbenzoate, sodium, potassium and ammonium persulfate and others, such as those disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos.2,471,959 and 2,491,471. Particularly preferred as polymerization initiators are the water soluble peroxygen compounds such as hydrogen peroxide, and the sodium, potassium and ammonium persulfates, the water soluble oxidation reduction or redox types of catalysts and the heavy metal activated, water soluble peroxygen and redox catalysts.Included in this preferred list are the water soluble persulfates the combination of one of the water soluble peroxygen compounds such as potassium persulfate with a reducing substance such as a polyhydroxy phenol, an oxidizable sulphur compound such as sodium bisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like the combination of a water soluble peroxygen compound such as potassium persulfate and dimethylaminopropionitrile the combination of a water soluble peroxygen compound with a reducing sugar or with a combination of a dimercapto compound and a water soluble ferricyanide compound and others. Heavy metal ions which greatly activate potassium persulfate and the redox catalyzed polymerizations include those of silver, copper, iron, cobalt, nickel and others. The preferred range of catalyst as above defined, is from about 0.01 to 5 parts by weight per one hundred parts by weight of monomers. Suitable emulsifiers include fatty acid soaps such as sodium laurate organic sulfates and sulfonates such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the alkali metal salts of sulfonated petroleum or paraffinic oils, the sodium salts of aromatic sulfonic acids such as the sodium salts of naphthalene sulfonic acids, the sodium salts of dodecane 1 sulfonic acid, octadecane 1 sulfonic acid, etc. arylalkyl sulfonates such as sodium isopropyl benzene sulfonate, sodium isobutyl naphthalene sulfonate, and alkali metal salts of polymerized alkyl naphthalene sulfonic acids alkali metal and ammonium salts of sulfonated dicarboxylic acid esters and amides such as sodium dodecyl sulfosuccinate, sodium N octadecyl sulfosuccinimide, the polyalkyl and polyalkaryl alkoxylene phosphonate acids and salts more fully described in U.S.Patent No. 2,853,471, the so called cationic emulsifiers such as the salts of strong inorganic acids and organic bases containing long carbon chains, for instance, lauryl amine hydrochloride, the hydrochloride of diethylaminoethyl decylamine, trimethyl cetyl ammonium bromide, dodecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, the dimethyl cyclohexylamine salt of cetyl sulfonic ester and others may be used. In addition to the above and other polar or ionic emulsifiers, still other materials which may be used, singly or in combination with one or more of the above types of emulsifiers include the so called nonionic emulsifiers such as the polyether alcohols prepared by condensing ethylene or propylene oxide with higher alcohols, the fatty alkylamine condensates, the diglycol esters of lauric, oleic and stearic acids, and others. It is often desirable to add post polymerization emulsifiers to the latexes embodied herein for improved stability. While the polymerization may be carried out in the presence of air, the rate of reaction is ordinarily faster in the absence of oxygen and hence, polymerization in an evacuated vessel, at reflux, or under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen or C02 is preferred. The temperatures at which the polymerization is carried out is not critical, and the temperature may be varied widely from 30 C to 100 C or higher, though best results are generally obtained at a temperature of from about O C to about 70 C. Although the pH of the polymerization system is not critical, it is preferred that a pH of about 6 be employed during the polymerization reaction. The polymer latex may be adjusted to any desired pH. The polymerization may be a batch polymerization or one or more of the components, i.e., monomers, catalyst, activator, emulsifier, water, etc. may be added incremently or continuously during the polymerization reaction. The solids content of the resulting latex is typically between about 15 and 60. Typically the extent of polymerization is high and conversions greater than 90 prcent are achieved. Before the polymer latex is applied to a substrate in step B , it is typically mixed with a coalescing solvent. The addition of the coalescing agent lowers the minimum film forming temperature by softening the polymer particles sufficiently to allow them to flow together at a lower temperature. Coalescing agents suitable for use in the instant invention are solvents for the polymer in the latex. These coalescing agents have a boiling point of between 100 C and 300 C and they will not azeotrope with water. Preferred coalescing agents are dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, methyl pyrrolidone, dimethyl sulfoxide, diethylacetamide, diethyl formamide, acetonitrile, propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate, benzaldehyde, methoxyethanol, glycol carbonate and tetramethylene sulfone.The most preferred coalescing agent is dimethylformamide. Typically the amount of coalescing agent used is approximately between 0.5 and 30.0 percent, based on the total weight of solids in the latex. Optionally, before the latex is applied to the substrate, a polymerization initiator or catalyst may be added to the latex. Suitable initiators are the various peroxygen compounds such as the organic peroxides and hydroperoxides, the sodium, potassium and ammonium persulfates, and the heavy metal activated peroxygen and redox catalysts described earlier as polymerization initiators or catalysts for the latex forming MISSING SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS In order to better illustrate the instant invention the following Examples are provided Example A amRleA All of the coatings illustrated in the remaining examples incorporate a butadiene acrylonitrile preformed elastomer or rubbery polymer latex.This rubbery latex can be prepared by polymerizing with continuous agitation at 45 C in the substantial absence of oxygen a mixture of the following ingredients Ingredient Parts acrylonitri le 40 butadiene 1,3 60 GAFAC RE 610 emulsifier 2.4 azobisisobutyronitrile 0.3 t dodecyl mercaptan 0.5 water 200 A mixture of R 0 CH2CH20 n PO3M2 and RO CH2CH2O nj2PO2M where n is a number from 1 to 40, R is an alkyl or arylalkyl group and M is hydrogen, ammonia or an alkali metal.
