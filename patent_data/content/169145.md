# ENVELOPE SORTING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A sorting apparatus sequentially delivers envelopes to a staging area for transfer past a device for sensing specified characteristics of each envelope and or its contents, and in corporates a deflector mechanism which is capable of selec tively delivering envelopes to any of a plurality of receiving areas in accordance with signals received from the sensing device. The apparatus is capable of use as a stand alone unit, or as an integral portion of a mail extraction device. In either case, the area into which envelopes of a specified charac teristic are deflected may be secured, so that the diverted envelopes may be safely retained for subsequent access only by authorized personnel.
