# Improvements in package strapping tools.

## Abstract
A package strapping tool in which both tensioning means and means for joining overlapping ends of a loop of metal strapping are operated by pneumatic or hydraulic fluid pressure, has a time delay device which initiates the jointing operation, the timing cycle of which is started by the application of fluid pressure to the tensioning means. Fluid pressure applied to the tensioning means is also applied to a valve chamber 119 and through an adjustable restrictor 113 to a chamber 112 . The gradually rising pressure in the chamber 112 is applied to the top of a piston 116 the shank 117 of which abuts a pilot valve disc 118 biassed to the closed position by fluid pressure in the valve chamber 119 . When the pressure in the chamber 112 reaches a predetermined value after a time delay determined by the setting of the restrictor 113 , the piston 116 opens the pilot valve disc 118 and admits fluid pressure through a port 126 to a sealing valve controlling the jointing means. In a modification, a piston of the time delay device is subject to supply pressure on one side and the flow of fluid out of the cylinder on the other side of the piston is restricted. The piston moves slowly along the cylinder and at the end of its stroke engages and opens a pilot valve of a servo system controlling the jointing means.
