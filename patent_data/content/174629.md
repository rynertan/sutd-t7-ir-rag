The single drive source drives the feed device and the loading device is driven through the feed device. A carrier 81 having a carrier rack 17 moved by the drive source and a carrier pinion 62 meshing with the carrier rack are provided in a drive system for a loading pinion 68 meshing with a disc case rack 5 and the loading pinion is connected to the carrier pinion through clutch means.
