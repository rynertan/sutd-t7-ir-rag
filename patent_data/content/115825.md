# ARRANGEMENT FOR INTERCONNECTING A PROJECTILE AND A PROJECTILE EXTENSION COMPONENT

## Abstract
Arrangement for interconnecting a projectile 12 and a projectile extension component 1 . The projectile 2 and the extension component 1 each incorporates its own con necting element 10, 14 which are capable of being intro duced into each other by causing one of the connecting ele ments 14 to be so deformed as to be retained in its de formed state in the second 10 connecting element. The connecting elements 10, 14 are capable of being intro duced into each other with the help of the firing forces whose effect is immediate when the projectile 2 and the extension component 1 are fired from the barrel of a weapon.
