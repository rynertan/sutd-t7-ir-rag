# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MONITORING AND CONTROLLING WELL DRILLING PARAMETERS

## Abstract
A mud logging system for receiving and displaying conditions measured during the drilling of a well including a plurality of units for receiving and processing signals from sensors responsive to the values of the conditions. A D convertors in each of said units produce digital representa tions of signals received from the sensors and the digital representations are utilized with visual display means in the units for digitally displaying values of the conditions. A slave computer of the digital type is interfaced with the A D converters and a file disc. Under control of said slave computer the digital representations are transferred to the file disc, and a recorder also under control of the slave computer displays selected ones of the conditions. The system also includes a master computer of the digital type connected to access data on the file disc, to utilize the accessed data to provide for analysis of drilling conditions.
