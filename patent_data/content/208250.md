# CHARACTERIZATION SYSTEM FOR RADIOACTIVE WASTES

## Abstract
Systems for characterizing the weight, physical state and isotopic content of radioactive waste bearing containers. Con tainers are supplied to a weighing station 10 where the weight density of the contents may be determined. A con veyor 12 then takes the container to a turntable 14 where the entire container is scanned for gamma radiation to help determine the isotopic content. The gamma source located on the opposite of the turntable 14 from the gamma scanner 16 allows calibration of the gamma scanner 16 and com pensation for attenuation of radiation by the container. A con veyor 18 then takes the waste container to a second turn table 20 where it is x rayed 22, 24 , to detect vibrations in free liquids within the container. A predetermined fraction of the containers is then directed to an active neutron analyzer to determine the characteristics of neutrons emitted from the container. The remaining fraction of drums bypasses the ac tive neutron analyzer. In either case the drums are then re moved from the characterization station. A calibration con tainer containing waste of known isotopic content may also be included in the system and periodically pass through the system to properly calibrate all stations.
