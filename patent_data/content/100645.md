# Antibacterial mycaminosyl tylonolide and related macrolide derivatives.

## Abstract
Antibacterial and intermediate substances which are derived by selective chemical transformation of partially hydrolyzed tylosin and related macrolide derivatives in which only the mycaminose sugar remains attached to the macrocyclic lactone ring. Compounds having particular utility as antibacterial agents have C 6 side chain aldehyde converted to a hydrazone, the C 3 ring hydroxy group acylated, and or the C 14 hydroxymethyl group converted to a sulfonate or carboxylate ester, or to a halomethyl, ami nomethyl, sulfonamidomethyl or carboxamidomethyl group. Compounds whose prime utility is as intermediates have side chain aldehyde group protected as an acetal, mycami nose sugar hydroxyls protected as carboxylate ester and or C 14 hydroxymethyl converted to a formyl or azidomethyl group.
