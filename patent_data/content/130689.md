# Non heated gellan gum gels.

## Abstract
Gellan gum gels ere formed without first going through a heating and cooling cycle, by reaction of an aqueous solution of the gum with cations of group s I, II and or III at below 70 C. Gelled food products are obtained by this method, the food being surrounded by the aqueous solution of the gum during the reaction. A dry mix comprises gellan gum and a sequestrant.
