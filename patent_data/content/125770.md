# Process for electrophoretic film deposition.

## Abstract
In a process for the electrophoretic deposition of an organic resin coat on a conductive substrate, the aqueous resin bath includes more than 1 and preferably less than 40 of a surfactant compatible with the resin bath. The surfac tant reduces the tendancy of the deposited resin coat to act as an insulator, thereby limiting the thickness of resin coat which can be deposited. Thus, the invention enables thicker resin coats to be formed.
