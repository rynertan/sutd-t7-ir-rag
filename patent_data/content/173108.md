## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor integrated circuit arrangement comprising a semiconductor integrated circuit device containing an input MOS transistor responsive to an input signal, an input terminal, coupled to said input MOS transistor, for receiving said input signal and an electrostatic discharge protection circuit limiter means coupled to said input MOS transistor and responsive to a given threshold control potential, for limiting at said variable threshold the electrostatic potential applied to the gate of said input MOS transistor, said threshold being variable according to said given threshold control potential. Such a device is known from IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin Vol. 22, No. 10, March 1980, pages 4452 4453 in the report entitled, Voltage Programmable Protect Circuit Another electrostatic protection circuit is known from EP A 0 042 305, using an MOS transistor connected to ground. The transistor is a depletion mode device, so that it conducts when no power is applied. When power is applied, it is switched off and no protection is provided. Generally speaking, for an insulated gate field effect transistor MOS transistor being formed with a metallic gate, insulation film and semiconductor elements, any countermeasure to avoid a faulty application of overvoltage to the gate electrode should be adopted. This is because such a faulty overvoltage application will rupture the electrical insulation of the gate insulation film and result in permanently damaging the MOS semiconductor device with a slight supply of power. The gate oxide ruptures when the dielectric strength of the gate oxide, made of e.g. silicon dioxide, is more than approximately 10⁷ V cm. Thus, if a voltage of 30 50 V is applied across a 300 500 Å thick gate oxide, a rupture occurs. It is conventionally known that such permanent damage can be prevented by providing an input protection circuit which simply suppresses the peak potential of an input voltage below the voltage at which a rupture occurs. However, when the above conventional input protection circuit is applied to an ultraviolet erasable non volatile semiconductor memory EPROM or an electric erasable non volatile semiconductor memory EEPROM and, if an input terminal of an EPROM or an EEPROM is designed to be commonly used for a low voltage signal input and high voltage signal input whose potential will not cause said permanent damage , a certain problem arises. That is, when a high voltage signal is supplied to the input terminal, the input protection circuit with a given fixed input limiting threshold could respond to the potential of a high voltage input signal so that the necessary high voltage component exceeding the input limiting threshold is suppressed or blocked. Such inconvenience cannot be avoided according to said conventional input protection circuit. It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide an improved electrostatic discharge protection circuit for protecting from overvoltage damage a MOS input device which is to be responsive to a high voltage input signal. According to the invention, the semiconductor integrated circuit device initially defined is characterized in that said limiter means includes a bipolar transistor whose emitter collector path is inserted between the gate of said input MOS transistor and a fixed reference potential and the base of said bipolar transistor is connected to receive said given threshold control potential. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing, in which Fig. 1 shows an electrostatic discharge protection circuit for protecting from overvoltage damage a MOS input device which is to be responsive to a high voltage input signal. A signal input terminal 11 receives an input signal. Terminal 11 is coupled via a resistor element 16 to an input node 14 of a MOS input semiconductor integrated circuit 13 which contains an input MOS transistor 12 having a gate coupled to node 14. Node 14 is coupled to a circuit ground substrate via a gate controlled MOS diode 15 having a predetermined gate controlled breakdown voltage V According to the circuit of Fig. 1 the potential difference between the gate and drain of MOS diode 15 becomes Vc, because the gate receives potential Vc while the drain potential is substantially zero when no signal is input to terminal 11. In this case the gate controlled breakdown voltage of diode 15 is equivalently increased by Vc from the intrinsic gate controlled breakdown voltage V Resistor element 16 between input terminal 11 and input node 14 serves to suppress an excessive input current fed into diode 15 and also to reduce the rate of change of an input signal voltage with a rapid potential change, thereby achieving the protection not only for input MOS transistor 12 but also for gate controlled MOS diode 15. The resistance value of resistor element 16 is preferably 1 2 kohm. Fig. 2 shows a circuit configuration of an embodiment of the present invention. In the embodiment of Fig. 2 a PNP bipolar transistor 15A is used in place of the gate controlled MOS diode. The base of transistor 15A is responsive to a fixed or variable base potential Vb. When the potential at input node 14 exceeds the given base potential Vb of the base emitter threshold voltage of transistor 15A, transistor 15A is rendered conductive so that node 14 is shunted to the circuit ground, thereby achieving the input circuit protection. As will be understood from the above description, the limiting threshold for the circuit protection is varied by a threshold control potential Vb continuously or optionally applied to the base of protection transistor 15A. From this, MOS input semiconductor circuit 13 is protected from damage due to an excessive high surge voltage input, while no signal blocking is effected for a high voltage signal input so that semiconductor circuit 13 can respond to such a high voltage signal input. While the invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is understood that the invention is not to be limited to the disclosed embodiment. For instance, MOS input circuit 13 may include a digital circuit other than EPROM EEPROM, or it may include a MOS input analog circuit.
