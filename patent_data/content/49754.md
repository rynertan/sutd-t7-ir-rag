# High speed temperature controlled electrometer.

## Abstract
A high speed temperature controlled, microcircuit elec trometer comprising a preamplifer 32 with a very high resistance feedback resistor R1 and temperature sensor on a substrate which is temperature controlled by a thermo electric module on which the substrate 34 is mounted and which is held within a very small range by temperature control circuitry. The preamplifier 32 , feedback resistor R1 , temperature sensor and thermo electric module 38 are all enclosed in a hermetically sealed, dry gas environ ment, maintained at an essentially constant temperature, to reduce the effects of hostile environments, such as tempera ture changes, vibration, contamination, and humidity. This electrometer operates at high speed and is highly responsive to small current values such as ion currents generated by ionized gas molecules in a mass spectrometer.
