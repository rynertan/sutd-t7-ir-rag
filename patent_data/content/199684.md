# A collapsible trestle.

## Abstract
A collapsible trestle comprises a seating part 13 which is supported by two legs 11, 12 . The end of one leg 11 remote from the seating part 13 is so attached to a base plate 10 , intended for abutment with the foundation surface on which the trestle rests, as to be pivotable about a first axis 16 which extends substantially parallel with the plane of the base plate. The end of the other leg 12 remote from the seating part can be detachably connected to a fitting 17 mounted on the base plate at a distance from the point of attachment of the aforementioned one leg. The seating part 13 can also be swung relative to the base plate about a second axis 15 which extends substantially parallel with the longitudinal axis of the one leg 11 .

## Description
A COLLAPSIBLE TRESTLEThe present invention relates to a collapsible trestle of the kind which includes a seating part supported on two legs.The object of the invention is to provide a novel and improved trestle, and to this end the invention is characterized mainly in that in a trestle of aforesaid kind the end of one leg remote from the seating part is so attached to a base plate, intended for abutment with the foundation surface on which the tre.stle stands, as to be pivotable about a first axis which is substantially parallel with the plane of the base plate, while the end of the other leg remote from the seating part is detachably connectable to a fitting on the base plate located at a distance from the location of attachment of said one leg and in that the seating part is rotatable relative to the base plate about a second axis which extends substantially parallel with the longitudinal axis of said one leg.This arrangement enablesthe trestle to be collapsed readily and quickly onto the base plate in an advantageous manner, by releasing the end of the said other leg distal from the seating part, turning the seating part through 900 about said second axis, and by swinging said one leg towards the bottom plate about the first axis.Further characteristic features of the invention and other advantages afforded thereby are defined in the following claims and will be evident from the following description of an exemplary embodiment illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in whichFigure 1 is an end view of a trestle according to the invention when raised Figure 2 is a side view of the trestle illustrated in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a plan view of the trestle illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, when collapsed Figure 4 is a plan view of the same trestle when raised andFigure 5 is a sectional view of a modified form of the seating part illustrated in Figure 1 4, this section corresponding to the section indicated by the section line V V in Figure 4.In the Figures, in which equivalent or substantially equivalent elements are identified by the same references, there is illustrated a collapsible trestle which comprises a base plate 10, first and second legs 11 and 12, and a substantially V shaped seating part 13. The end of the first leg 11 distal from the seating part 13 is fitted in a substantially U shaped fitting 14 carried by the plate 101 More specifically, the distal end of the first leg 11 has a cylindrical lower part 15 which extends through and is journalled for rotation in a diametrical bore formed in a shaft 16 which in turn is journalled for rotation in the opposing side pieces of the fitting 14.The lower end of the second leg 12 is detachable connected to a further fitting 17, which is also of substantially U shape configuration and which is carried by the base plate 10 and spaced from the first mentioned fitting 14. There can be used for this connection of the leg 12, for example, a connecting pin 19 which passes through holes 1 in the side pieces of the U shaped fitting 17 and a hole 18 in the lower end of the leg 12, as illustrated in Figures 1 and 4. In the raised position of the trestle, the legs 11, 12 are supported by the upstanding side pieces of respective U shaped fitting 14, 17 When wishing to collapse the trestle, the pin 19 is withdrawn so as to release the lower end of the leg 12.The leg 11 is then turned in a clock wise direction, as seen in Figures 1, 2 and 4, through about 900, and the leg 11 swung downwardly about the shaft 16 onto the base plate. In its downwardly swung position the leg 11 is received in the fitting 14 and is held detachably therein by means of the pin 19, which to this end passes through holes 20 and 21 provided in the upstanding side pieces of the fitting 14 and in the leg 11 respectively. As will be evident from a comparison between Figures 1 and 3, the end of the leg 12 adjacent the seating part 13 is advantageously mounted for pivotal movement about a shaft not shown which, when the trestle is raised, is substantially parallel with the shaft 16, so that the leg 12 can be swung towards the leg 11, for, example in parallellity therewith, so as to reduce the external measurements of the collapsed trestle Figure 3 .The base plate 10 also carries a fitting 22 which receives the free end part of the leg 12 when the trestle is collapsed.The seating part 13 can be swung to a limited extent about an axis indicated at 23 in Figure 1, this axis being substantially parallel with the plane of the base plate 10 in the raised position of the trestle. The extent to which the seating part can be swung is limited by a stop means 24 provided on the leg 11, this stop means being located so as to permit the seating part to be swung to selected positions between the limit positions shown in full an broken lines respectively in Figure 2.When using the trestle to support an elongated object 25, such as tubing for example Figure 5 , one end of the tubing is seated in the V shaped recess of the seating part 13 while, if the other part of the tubing is rested against the ground, the seating part 13 is swung about the axis 23 until said seating part is inclined to the ground at the same angle as the object 25. The object 25 is secured by means of a securing chain 26, shown only in Figure 5, one end of which is attached to a block 27 which is movable in the part 13, and the other end of which is arranged to be passed over a nose shaped portion of the part 13. The block 27 is movable in a groove or channel 29 which merges with an opening 30 passing through the seating part, seen towards the centre of said seating part.The mutually opposite sides 31 Figure 4 of the groove or channel 29 form guide surfaces for the block 27. The reference 32 identifies a screw or spindle which is in screw thread engagement with a screw threaded hole in a portion 33 of the seating part 13 bridging the groove or channel 29. The spindle 32 can be turned by means of a handle 34 pivotably mounted thereon and is reduced in diameter at the end thereof distal from the handle 34, to form a cylindrical pin 35. Screwed onto this latter end of the spindle 32 is a cylindrical nut 36 which is provided with a screw thread along solely a part of its length. The block 27 is placed on the pin 35 together with a square washer plate 37, both the block 27 and the plate 37 having a through passing hole corresponding to the diameter of the pin 35. The plate 37 and the block 27 are held onto the pin 35 by means of a plate 38 and a bolt 39 screwed into the pin. When the spindle 32 is rotated in one direction or theother, the block 27 is either pressed downwards by the nut 36 acting on the plate 37 or is drawn upwards by the plate 38 acting on the undersurface of the block. The block 27 and the plate 37 are guided against the groove sides 31 during this up or down movement, so that the block and plate will not rotate together with the spindle 32.The invention is not limited to the aforedescribed embodiment illustrated in the drawings, but various modifications can be made within the scope of the invention as defined in the claims.
