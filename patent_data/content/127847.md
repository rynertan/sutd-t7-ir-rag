to 6 and especially up to 4 carbon atoms. In a compound of formula I, the carboxyl group may be esterified with a carboxyl esterifying group R. An esterified carboxyl group COOR is, for example, an ester formed with an unsubstituted or substituted aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, cycloaliphatic aliphatic, aryl, arali phatic, heterocyclic or heterocyclic aliphatic alcohol having up to 2D carbon atoms, or is, for example, a silyl or stannyl ester.R may represent, for example, a straight or branched chain substi tuted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl group having up to IS carbon atoms, preferably up to 8 carbon 2tOm5 and especially up to 4 carbon atoms, for example, a .methyl, ethyl, propyl, sso propyl, n butyl, sec butyl, iso butyl, tert butyl, n pentyl, n hexyl, allyl, or vinyl group.An aliphatic group R, especially s methyl group, nay be substituted by a cycloalkyl, aryl or heterocyclic group, or R may itself represent a cycloalkyl, aryl or heterocyclic group.A cycloaliphatic group R may have up to 18 carbon atoms and is, for example, a cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl or adamantyl group. An aryl group may have up to 12 carbon atoms and may have two or more fused rings. An aryl group R is, for example, an unsubstituted or substituted phenyl group, and an unsubstituted or substituted aralkyl group is, for example, a benzyl, D nitrobenzyl, benzhydryl or pmethoxybenzyl group.A heterocyclic group may have one or more heteroatoms, selected from oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur, and up to 14 atoms in total.A heterocyclic group is, for example, an oxygen containing heterocyclic group, for examples a tetrahydropyranyl or phthalidyl group.

A group R that may be renoved readily without substantial degradation of the rest of the molecule is particularly useful as a carboxyl protecting group. Examples of esters that are readily split by reduction are arylmethyl esters, for example, benzyl, D nitroben2yl, benzhvdryl and trityl esters. A stannyl ester, for example, a tri n butyl stannyl ester, may be split readily by hydrolysis, for examples by solvolysis, for example, using water, an alcohol, a phenol or 2 carboxylic acid, for example, acetic acid,Certain ester groups may be split off by base hydrolysis, for example, acetylmethyl and acetoxymethyl ester groups.There may be used an esterifying group that is removable under physiological conditions, that is to say, the esterifying group is split off in vivo to give the free acid or the carboxylate, for example, an acylaxymethyl ester, e. . an acetoxymethyl or pivaloyloxymethyl ester, an aminoalkanyloxyn.ethyl ester, for example, an L glycyloxymethyl, L valyloxymethyl or L leucyloxymethyl ester, or a phthalidyl ester, or an optionally substituted 2 aminoathyl ester, for example, a 2 diethylamino ethyl or 2 1 morpholino ethyl ester.Preferred esters are the p nitrobenzyl, phthalidyl, pivaloyloxymethyl, acetylmethyl and acetoxy methyl esters.

Some compounds of formula I which contain a basic centre may exist as Zwitterions such salts are also part of this invention A salt of a free acid of formula I may be produced by reacting the free acid With the appropriate base in a solvent, preferably under conditions under which the salt precipitates. A preferred base is potassium ethylheranoate. A salt may be produced directly from an ester by splitting off the ester group under suitable reaction con editions, for example, catalytic reduction of an ester, for example, a a nitrobenzyl ester, in an aqueous organic sol vent, for example, comprising water and ethyl acetate, dioxane, or tetrahydrofuran, in the presence of a metal salt, especially a bicarbonate, for example, in an equiva lent aiiount or in Åa slight excess, yields a salt directly.

A A compound of formula IV a, IV b, or I...V.c is preferably produced by removing the protective group from a compound of formula Va, Vb or Vc, respectively,EMI58.1 EMI59.1 in which R , Rêa, Rêb, R a and A are defined as above, and denotes a hydroxy protecting group. Preferred groups R4a are those which are compatible with the synthesis of the compound of formula V and which may be removed under reaction conditions in which the resulting compound IV is stable. Compound 1 has been found to be stable in the presence of a proton source, for example, hydrogen chloride, aqueous hydrochloric acid or aqueous hydrofluoric acid. Accordingly, one type of preferred hydroxy protecting groups R4a are those which may be removed under acidic conditions.Such groups are well knows in the art and are for example, tetrahydropyranyl and tetrahydrofuranyl groups acetal and ketal groups, for example, of formulaEMI59.2 in which R6a and R7a, which may be the same or different, each represents a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group, preferably a methyl group, or R6a and R7a together with the carbon atom to which they are attached represent a ring having from4 to 7 carbon atoms, for example, a tetrahydropyranyl or tetrahydrofuranyl ring and R5a represents a lower alkyl group, preferably a methyl or ethyl group. R4a may also represent a silyl group, for example, as described above in relation to R, for example siR8aR9aRa10 groups, in which , R9a and Ra, which may be the same or different, each represents a lower alkyl group or an aryl group, for example, triethylsilyl, t butyldimethylsilyl and methldiphenylsilyl groups and stannyl groups, for example, as described above in relation to R, for example, SnR11aR12aR13a groups, in which R11a, R12a and R11a and R13a, which may be the same or different, each represents 2 lower alkyl group, for example, a tri n butylstannyl group.Preferred R4a groups are tetrahydropyranyl, 2 methoxyprop2yl and t butyldimethylsilyl groups. A t butyldimethylsilyl group may be removed in a known manner by acid hydrolysis, for example, using moderately concentrated hydrochloric acid, for example 6 HCl, e.g., in tetrahydrofuran cf Belgian Patent Specification No. 881 012 ,or hydrogen chloride in tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformarnide, dioxane, a lower alkanol, or acetonitrile tetra n butyl ammonium fluoride in an acidic medium, e.g., in acetic acid cf Belgian PatentSpecification No. 882 764 or aqueous hydrogen fluoride in the presence of acetonitrile cf J. Chem. Soc.Perkin 1, 1981, 2055 . The term known is used herein to mean in actual use in the art or described in the literature of the art . A compound of the general formula V may be prepared according to the following reaction scheme EMI61.1 in which R , Rêa, Rêb, R a, R4a and A are as defined above. A compound of formula VIIImay be prepared as described in Belgian Patent Specification No. 882 764. A compound of formula VIII may be converted into a compound of formula VIlby reaction with a compound of formula IX R a S R14a IX in which R3a is as defined above and R14a represents a hydrogen atom or an alkali metal atom, especially a sodium or potsssium atom. R a preferably represents a straight chain lower alkyl group, especially an ethyl group, or a straight chain lower alkenyl group, especially 2n allyl group. The reaction is generally carried out in a solvent, preferably a protic solvent, for example, water or an alcohol, or an aprotic, water iniscible solvent which is preferably polar, for example, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulphoxide, tetrahydrofuran or dioxan. The reaction temperature is, for example, from 20 to 50, preferably from 10 to 20 C. To obtain a compound of formula VIa compound of formula VII may be reacted, in the presence of a base1 with a compound of formula X Y1CH2CO2R in which R is as defined above and yÚ represents a group that is capable of being replaced by a nucleophilic group and is, for example, a halogen atom, preferably a bromine or iodine atom, or a modified hydroxy group, preferably a sulphonyloxy group of the formula SO3R16a in which R16a represents a lower alkyl or CF3 group, or a phenyl group which. is un substituted or is substituted by a nitro, p bromo or p methyl group. yl preferably represents a bromine or iodine atom or a methylsulphonate, trifluoromethylslphonate, tolylsulphonate or benzenesulphonate group. The base may be inorganic, organic or organometallic, for example, an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxide,. oxide, carbonate, bicarbonate or hydride,for example, sodium hydroxide, magnesium oxide, potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate or sodium hydride a tertiary amine, for example, a trialkylamine, for example, triethylamine, DABCO diazabicyclo 2,2,2 octane , pyridine, or an alkyl substituted or amino substituted or dialkylamino substituted pyridine, for example, N,N dimethylaminopyridine, or collidine a guanidine, for example, tetramethylguanidine D3N diazabicyclo 4,3,0 non 5 ene or DBU diazabicyclo 5,4,0 undec 7 ene , a polymeric base i.e., a base attached to an inert polymeric support e.g., Hunig s base diisopropylethylamine attached to e.g., polystyrene a metallated amine, for example, a metallated alkyl or arylamine, for example, lithium diisopropylamide LDA , lithium hexamethyldisilazide, lithium piperidide, lithium 2,2,6,6 tetramethylpiperidide, or a Grignard reagent, for example, inethylmagnesium bromide. Preferred bases are, for example, potassium carbonate, sodium hydride, lithium diisopropylamide and triethylamine. The reaction is generally carried out in an aprotic solvent or diluent, for example, a tertiary amide, for example, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetaide or hexamethylphosphoramide a hydrocarbon, for example, benzene or toluene or an ether, for example, diethyl ether, tetrahydro furan or dioxane or acetonitrile, dimethyl sulpboxide, or sulpholane. Dimethylformamide anc dimethylacetamide are preferred. A mixture of two or more solvents and or diluents may be used. The reaction may be carried out at a temperature generally within the range ot from 800C to 30 C preferably from 40 to 30 C, and especiallyfrom 20 to 20 C. From 1 to 1.5 moles of compcund X are preferably used per mole of compound VII especially from 1 to 1.1 moles of X per mole of VII. The base is used in an amount, for example, from 1 to 4 moles of base per mole of compound VII. The reaction is preferably carried out by dissolving compound xTz in a solvent, advantageously in dimethylform amide with stirring, adding the base, adding the compound of formula .X and reacting at the desired temperature. The resulting compound of formula VImay be worked up and isolated in the usual manner, for example, using chromatographic and or crystallisation techniques, or the subsequent reaction may be carried out directly on the resulting reaction mixture after removal of any solvent that is not cc... 2tible with the subsequent reaction. If R in formula VIrepresents a carboxyl esterifying group, this group may be converted into another esterifying group R 1 for example, to introduce a group R that is more easily removable under desired conditions. This transesterification is generally carried out as follows the ester for formula VI is hydrolysed in a known manner using for example, acid or alkaline hydrolysis, preferably using an alkali metal hydroxide, especially sodium or potassium hydroxide. The ester of formula VE,for example, a methyl ester, is preferably hydrolysed using an alkali metal hydroxide, especially one mole thereof per mole of the ester of formula VI in a solvent, for example et nanol, methanol or water, or an aqueous organic solvent, for example, tetrahydrofuran water, ethanol water, or acetonitrile water. The reaction mixture map then be acidified to give a solution oL pH 1 to .5, preferably 2 to 4, and the free acid ray then be isolated and, if desired, the free acid is then esterfied with an esterifying agent capable of introducing z different esterifying group Rf, for example with an alcohol ROT in the presence of an acid or another activating agent, for example, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, or with an alkylating agent R YÚ in which Y1 is as defined above. Preferably. a salt may be isolated and esterified directly. A compound of formula VI may be converted into a compound of formula V by treatment with a base in the presence of carbon disulphide followed by reaction with an acylating agent, or by treatment with a base, then with carbon disulphide, and finally reaction with an acylating agent. An acylating agent is generally an activated carboxylic acid. The activated carboxylic acid may be any activated acid derivative comprising the group Rêa b. Such derivatives are well knows in the art, and include acid halides, acid anhydrides, and activated esters. An anhydride may be symmetrical or asymmetrical. For the introduction of a groupEMI65.1 to give a compound of formula IVa, the acylating agent preferably has one of the formulaelia to lie EMI65.2 in which Rêa and Rêb are as defined above, and Z represents a halogen ato, especially a chlorine or bromine. atom or represents an activated ester or amide, or a radical derived from an acid azide. Such coupling reagents are well kno.m in the art of peptide chemistry. In the case of formula Vb, the groupEMI66.1 may be introduced by means of an acylating agent of formula XII EMI66.2 in which Hal represents a halogen atom, especially a chlorine atom.For the introduction of a groupEMI66.3 to give a to compound of formula Vc, a dicarboxylic acid derivative of formula XIIIis usedEMI66.4 in which A and Z are as defined above, and Z preferably represents a halogen atom, especially a chlorine atom. As mentioned above, A represents the residue of a dicarboxylic acid or represents a direct bond. A is derived, for example, from malonic, dimethylmalonic, succinic, glutaric, adipic, pimelic or phthalic acid. The compound of formula Vlis preferably reacted first with a base, then with carbon disulphide, and then finally with the acylating agent. The base preferably has a pXA 20, and is preferably a metallated amine. Examples of preferred bases are lithium diisopropylamide, lithium 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl piperidide, lithium cyclohexyl isopropylamide, lithium hexamethyl disilazide, and sodamide. The reaction is generally carried out in an inert solvent, for example, an oxygenated hydrocarbon, preferably an ether, for ea as.lple, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, glyme or diglyme. The reaction temperature is, for example, from 120 to 3O0C, preferably from 100 to 20 C. The amount of base used is for example from 1 to 4 moles, calculated per mole of compound VI, preferably from 2.0 to 3.0 moles of base. Carbon disulphide is preferably used in amount of from 1 to 5 moles, especially from 2 to 3 moles, per mole of compound VI. The reaction is preferably carried out as follows to a stirred solution of compound Founder an inert atmosphere is added the base then carbon disulphide, if desired in solution in the same solvent as compound VIor in a different solvent, and finally the acylating agent to complete the reaction. There may then be admixed a protic source having a pK less than 10, and especially from 5 to 2,for example, acetic, citric, oxalic or formic acid. The compound of the general formula II has R stereochemistry at position 5. This is the stereochemistry found ln naturally occurring penicillins and is, in general, preferable to 5S stereochemistry, more SR compounds being antibiotically active than are 5S compounds. We have found a process that gives predominantly the desired 5R compound of formula II. It has been proposed previously British Patent Application 2074563A to halogenate a compound of formula V i.e., a compound having a protected hydroxy group in the side chain attached to the 3 position, but we have found that this process gives only a 4R halogenated compound, which in its turn, gives a compound analogous to that of formulaII but having the undesired 55 stereochemistry. We have found that, very surprisingly, if the protective group is removed from compound V prior to halogenation, the resulting halogenated compound of formula III is predominantly 4S.The isomer ratio 4S 4R is compound II resulting from the halogenation ovaries according to th2 reaction cnditions but is, for example, in the range of from 3 1 to as high as 9 1. More over, the 4R and 4S isomers of formulallI can be separated easily, for example, by chromatography. The 45 halogenated intermediates of formula III give virtually exclusively a compound of formula II with the 5R stereochemistry as shown. The presumed participation of the free hydroxyl group of the side chain of formula III in giving the more sterically hindered compound of formula II is also unexpected and constitutes a valuable advance in the preparation of the penem compounds of formula II. The esterifying group t may be removed from a compound of formula II before reaction with µ compound of formulaIII to give a compound of formula I, but it is preferable to protect the carboxyl group in a compound of formula II.After synthesis of a compound of formula I, an esterifying group may be removed to give the free acid, which may then be converted into a salt, if desired, or the ester may be converted directly into salt, for example, as described above. Methods for reomoving and introducing ester groups, and for producing salts and free acids are well known. An ester of a compound may be transesterified, or a free acid of formula I may be esterified, to give an ester having particular, desired properties, for example, with regard to ease of removal under physiological conditions. The invention also provides 8 modification of the process of the invention, wherein in a compound of formula I, a substitutent of a group Rê is converted into another substitutent of Rê.The following are examples of interconversions of substituents of Rê R4 being as defined above . R4S to R4SO R4S or R4SO to R4SO2 NO2 to NH2 , which may then be alkylated or acylated, CN to CH2NH2, which may then be alkylated or acylated, to to NH2 , which may then be alkylated or acylated, HO may be alkylated or acylated R4CO O to HO , which may then be alkylated or acylated Halogen to SH, SR4, SO2H, SO3H, CN, CO2H or N3 which may be further treated as described above tor the appropriate group.The methods for carrying out such reactions are knoka in the art, for example, an alkylthio group may be oxidised, preferably with a carboxylic peracid, especially m chloroperbenzoic acid, to give the corresponding alkylsulphinyl or alkylsulphonyl group a nitro group may be reduced to an amino group b noble metal catalysed hydrogenation, for example, using platinum, or 10 palladium on carbon, c.f. M. Freifelder, Catalytic Hydrogenation in OrganicSynthesis, Willey Interscience, 1978, ra0 e 20, and P.N. Rylander,Catalytic Hydrogenation over Platinum Metals, Academic Press, 1967Chapter 11 an amino group may be alkylated with a conventional alkylating aC.ent, for example, a lower alkyl halide, for example, methyl iodide, or acylated with, for example, an acid chloride or acid anhydride, for example, acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride, a cyano group may be converted into an nitro group by reduction1 for example using a metal hydride an aside group may be converted into an amino group by reduction1 for example, using hydrogen sulphide or catalytic reduction and a hydroxy group may be alkylated or acylated as described above and a halide, especially an iodide, may be displaced by a nucleophile, for example CN ,R4S , R4SO2 or N3. Ineach case, the resulting group may be treated further, if appropriate. These modifications of the process of the invention are particularly useful for the production of a compound of formula I having a group Rê bearing 11 2 or 3 substituents1 any one or more of which is potentially unstable or incompatible during ary one or more of the stages of the reaction sequence described above. The conversion step is, accordingly, carried out after the step in which the substituent is potentially unstable or incompatible. It will be appreciated that although these modifications are particularly useful for the production of compounds of formula I having substituents on Rê that are potentially unstable in the production process, it is not limited to such groups, and ina further modification of the process of the invention, a substituent of Rê may be produced by conversion of another substituent that does not itself fall within the definition of a substituent of R2 for example, an unsubstituted or substituted, preferably p nitrosubstituted, benzyloxycarbonylamino group may be converted into a free amino group, for example, by noble metal catalysed hydrogenation, c.f. Mv Freitolder loc. sit., page 111, P.N. Rylander, loc. cit., page 455, and C. Berse et al.3. Org. Chem. 22, 805, 1957. All of the compounds that are provided by the invention may exist in any isomeric form, as discussed above, either as a pure isomer or as a mixture of any two o more isomers. A compound of formula I may have the R or S stereo chemistry independently at positions 5, 6 and 8. further isomeric forms will occur when an substituent contains a chiral carbon atoms. Any mixture of two or nore isomeric forts may be resolved if desired, or a compound of formula I can be used in the form of the isomeric mixture. U stereocbei iistry is generally preferred at position 5 in compound I, as in naturally occurring penicillins and cephalosporins . At position 6, S stereochemistry is generally preferred, and at position 8 R is generally preferred. It appears that the stereochemistry at position 5 Is the most important. The compounds of formula I and salts thereof possess antibacterial properties and have enhanced bioavailability. They may be used in humans and other animals, for example, to treat bacterial infections caused by gram positive and gram negrative bacteria, for example, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptacoccus py ogenes, Bacillus subtilis, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruminosa, and Proteus morganii, sone strains of which are penicillin resistant. The compounds of formula I are also ss lactamase inhibitors, and the compounds are generally stable to the action of ss lactamases produced by grampositive organisms, for example1 by Stavlococcus aureus and gram negative orbanisms, for example, Enterobactercloacae.The invention accordingly provides a pharmaceutical preparation which comprises a compound of formula I, cr a physiologically tolerable salt thereof, or a tixture of two or ore such substances as active ingredient, in admixture or conjunction with a pharmaceutically suitable carrier.The preparation may also comprise one or more other pharmaceutically active substances, for examples another antibacterial substance, especially one which has a P lactam rings The preparations may be in a form suitable for enthral or parenteral administration, for exanple, for oral, intravenous, or intra muscular administration, for example, as tablets, capsules, syrups, or sterile injectable or infusible solutions. The preparations are advantageously in unit dosage form and preferably comprise from 10 to 2000 lao of the active ingredient.The daily dosage of the active ingredient is generally from 20 to 8000 mg, particularly frati 50 500mg, prefe rably fran 50 500 mg, in divided doses, generally up to 4 doses, relating to a body weight of 75 kg. The invention also provides the use of an active ingredient as defined above as a ss lactamase inhibitor and or as an anti bacterial agent. The invention further provides a pharmaceutical preparation which comprises an active ingredient as defined above, in unit dosage form. The invention also provides a pharmaceutical preparation which comprises an active ingredient as defined above, or a physio logically tolerable salt thereof or a mixture of tilo or more such substances, and one or more further pharmaceutically active substances, for example, as described above and, for exple, in unit dosage form. Unit dosages are preferably as described above. The following Examples 1 to 06 illustrate the invention.
