## Description
A BUILDING FRAME ANCHORAGE JOINT The present invention relates to the manufacture and erection of prefabricated frames for buildings, and more particularly to timber frames of such buildings and attachment thereof to foundations. It is a disadvantage of known methods of anchoring timber frames to foundations, that the frames require a high degree of precision in manufacture since the position of the anchorage bolts may vary as much as 1 mm. It is an object of the present invention to overcome or substantially ameliorate the above disadvantages. There is disclosed herein an anchorage joint to secure a timber frame of a building to concrete foundations, said joint comprising a bar adapted to have one end portion securely embedded within the foundation so as to extend generally vertically therefrom, a sleeve to encompass the exposed portion of said bar and adapted to abut said foundation so as to extend generally vertically therefrom, said sleeve defining a hollow having a transverse crosssection greater than the transverse cross section of said rod to thereby allow transverse relative movement between the rod and sleeve, tensioning means coupling an upper portion of said rod and an upper portion of said sleeve, said means being adapted to engage said rod so as to tension same while applying the resulting reaction force to said sleeve to thereby secure the sleeve to the foundation, and frame engaging means fixed to said sleeve to which said frame is to be fixed. A preferred form of the present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 schematically depicts in perspective view a house frame and foundation attached thereto Figure 2 is a schematic part sectioned elevation of an anchorage joint to secure the frame of Figure 1 to the foundation of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a side elevation in part section of a further anchorage joint to be used to secure the frame ofFigure 1 to the foundation of Figure 1. Figure 4 is a plan view of the top portion of the anchorage bolt of Figure 3 Figure 5 is a plan view of the lower portion of the anchorage bolt of Figure 3 Figure 6 is a side elevation of the sleeve and timber engaging portions of the anchorage joint of Figure 3 Figure 7 is a plan view of the sleeve of Figure 6 sectioned along the line A A thereof Figures 8 and 10 are sectioned side elevations of a further anchorage joint to be used to secure the frame of Figure 1 to the foundation of Figure 1 and Figures 9 and 11 are plan views of the anchorage joint of Figures 8 and 10 sectioned along the lines A A thereof. In Figure 1 there is schematically depicted a timber frame 10 having a plurality of generally vertical timber members 11 joined by a plurality of horizontal members 14. The frame 10 is secured to concrete or brick foundations 15 by way of anchorage joints 16. Firstly with particular reference to Figure 2, there is schematically depicted an anchorage joint 20 adapted to engage a timber member 13 to secure it to the foundation 15. The anchorage joint 20 includes a rod 21 which is bent so as to have a generally L shaped lower section 22 which is securely embedded within the foundation 15. The rod 21 extends upwardly from the foundation 15 and includes a threaded portion 23 which is adapted to engage a nut 24. The joint 20 further includes a sleeve 25 which encompasses the exposed portion of the rod 21 and abuts the foundation 15 by means of a flange 26. Connecting the sleeve 25 and rod 21 is a transverse member 28 which transfers tension forces in the rod 21 to the sleeve 25 so as to secure the sleeve 25 to the foundation 15. Fixed to the sleeve 25 is the timber member 13 by means of a bolt 27. The bolt 27 extends through a passage 29 formed in the member 13 and openings 30 formed in the sleeve 25. It should be appreciated that the rod 21 is not straight but is bent so as to be located spaced from the longitudinal axis of the sleeve 25 to allow the bolt 27 to pass through the centre of the sleeve 25. Now with reference to Figures 3 to 5 wherein there is depicted an anchorage joint 40 which secures the vertical timber member and horizontal timber members 14 to the foundation 15. The anchorage joint 40 includes a rod 41 which as previously, is secured within the concrete foundation 15, a sleeve 42 which is engaged by a transverse member 43 which transfers tension forces in the bolt 41 to the sleeve 42 so as to secure the sleeve 42 to the foundation 15. The rod 41 is provided with an upper threaded part 44 which is engaged by a nut 45. As described previously the joint 40 is provided with passages 46 which allow a bolt 47 to pass through the sleeve 42 and passage 48 formed in the member 13 to secure the member 13 to the sleeve 42.The lower portion of the anchorage joint 40 includes a plurality of fins 49 which are located within slots 50 formed in the timber members 14. The fins 49 are provided with holes 51 which allow a bolt 52 to pass therethrough to thereby secure the members 14 to the anchorage joint 40 by way of a passage 53 formed in the timber members 14. In Figures 6 to 11 there are depicted alternative forms of the sleeve which forms part of the anchorage joints, which various forms enable the timber members 13 and 14 to be fixed to the foundations 15. As can be seen from Figures 6 and 7, the sleeve depicted therein enables four horizontal members 14 together with a vertical member 13 to be secured to the foundation 15. On the other end, the sleeve of Figures 8 and 9 is adapted to secure two horizontal members 14 and a vertical member 13 to the foundation 15 while lastly, in Figures 10 and 11, the sleeve depicted therein enables three horizontal members 14 and a vertical member 13 to be secured to the foundation member 15.
