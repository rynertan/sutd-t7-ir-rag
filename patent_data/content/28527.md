# A system and method for sorting articles in accordance with predetermined physical characteristics.

## Abstract
A system and method for sorting articles in accordance with a measured physical characteristic wherein a conveyor is provided which transports the articles from a point 42, 43 where the characteristic is measured to one of a plurality of points 87 downstream on the conveyor each of which cor responds to a predetermined measured value or range of measured values for the physical characteristic. The manner in which the articles are directed to the particular discharge point 87 involves the use of a memory segment which is assigned to each one of the discharge points. Each memory segment has a predetermined number of memory locations therein wherein the number of such locations is dependent upon the distance along the conveyor from the measuring point to the corresponding discharge point. The memory loca tions operate to receive and store digital data which is indica tive of the measured physical characteristics. Each memory segment is associated with means for indexing each of the memory locations in sequence and means for testing the data at each indexed memory location for the presence of stored data indicative of the measured physical characteristic. Further means 74, 76, 77 is provided for synchronizing the means for indexing with the movement of the transporting conveyor. The circuit also includes means 78, 111, 116 for outputting the stored data to the discharge point correspond ing to the memory segment containing the indexed location when digital data indicative of the measured physical charac teristic is found stored therein. In this fashion articles having predetermined physical characteristics are discharged from the conveyor at predetermined discharge stations.
