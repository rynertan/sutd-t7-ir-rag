# Circuit for controlling a multi wire printhead.

## Abstract
Control circuit for selectively energizing individual wires 20 in an electroerosion printhead for forming marks on metal coated paper 4 . Including a plurality of wires 20 arranged in M groups having an equal number N of wires. It comprises M selector transistors 22 for selecting a group M of wires N transistor switches 36 for selecting individual wires in a group M means for generating a first current I1 V2 R₂ from ground through the metal coated paper and each non selected wire to make a mark and means for generating a second current I2 V1 R₁ bypassing the paper wire junction to avoid making a mark.
