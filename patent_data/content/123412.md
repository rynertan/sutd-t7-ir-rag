# Method for manufacture of diphenylmethane diisocyanates.

## Abstract
Manufacture of a diphenylmethane diisocyanate for an N phenylcarbamate is economically accomplished in high yield with high selectivity by a method which comprises A a process of methylenation for the formation of a condensation product containing at least 80 mol of a dinuclear diphenyl methane dicarbamate by the steps of 1 causing a methylenat ing agent to react upon at least 2 moles of an N phenylcarbamate, based on 1 mole of the methylene group of said methylenating agent, in a liquid phase in the presence of an aqueous inorganic acid solution, 2 separating the resul tant reaction mixture into the aqueous inorganic acid solution and an organic phase reaction mixture containing substan tially none of said inorganic acid, and 3 subsequently treating said organic phase reaction mixture in the presence of an N phenylcarbamate and a carboxylic acid having a pKa of not more than 4 in an aqueous solution at a temperature of 25 C or a solid acid or an acid consisting of said two acids thereby converting a reaction intermediate possessing a methylene amino bond and contained in said organic phase reaction mixture to a diphenylmethane dicarbamate, and B a process of thermal decomposition by the steps of allowing a mixture comprising 1 to 50 by weight of the condensation product obtained in said process of A and 99 to 50 by weight of a thermal decomposition solvent having a boiling point under atmospheric pressure in the range of 120 to 350 C and being inactive to isocyanates to flow down into a reactor maintained at temperatures in the range of 180 to 380 C through the upper part thereof, causing said mixture to come into counterflow contact with a carrier introduced into said reactor upwardly via the lower part thereof thereby producing an organic hyd roxyl compound, allowing said organic hydroxyl compound to be discharged from said reactor in the form of vapor in conjunction with said carrier through the upper part thereof, and withdrawing the resultant isocyanate solution from said reactor through the lower part thereof.
