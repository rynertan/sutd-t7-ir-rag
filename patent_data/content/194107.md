Each channel 4 may be brought into or out of communication with the tubular portion 1 by moving a respective closure member or stopper 7 out of or into the channel. In an alternative em bodiment the tubular portion is rotatably received in a socket of the skirt and is formed with a suction inlet which may be brought into communication with a selected one of the chan nels by rotating the tubular portion to an appropriate angular position.
