## Description
Process for preparing polyesters or poly estercarbonates in the presence of a processing aid This invention is directed to a process for preparing a polyester or a poly ester carbonate which process comprises reacting a dihydric phenol with an aromatic diacid and a diaryl carbonate in the presence of from about 10 to about 60 weight percent, based on the weight of the polyester produced, of a processing aid under polyester or polyester carbonte forming conditions. Polyarylates are polyesters derived from a dihydric phenol, particularly 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, also identified as Bisphenol A, and an aromatic dicarboxylic acid, particularly mixtures of terephthalic and isophthalic acids. These polyarylates are high temperature, high performance thermoplastic polymers with a good combination of thermal and mechanical properties. They also have good processability which allows them to be molded into a variety of articles. Similarly, polyarylate copolymers containing carbonate linkages, i.e., poly ester carbonates display an excellent combination of properties. Many processes have been described in the literature for the preparation of polyesters and poly ester carbonates . One such process reacts a dihydric phenol, a diacid and a diaryl carbonate. Specifically, this latter process involves the reaction of a dihydric phenol, iso or terephthalic acids, or mixtures thereof, and a diaryl carbonate at temperatures of from about 260 to about 3500C. Optionally, a catalyst may be used. The utilization of from about 10 to about 60 percent of a processing aid is beneficial in preparing polyesters and poly ester carbonates in that the viscosity of the system is decreased. This decrease in viscosity provides a faster reaction time since better mixing of the reactants occurs which allows the reaction to proceed under kinetic control. Additionally, by using the processing aid, reaction times are relatively short so that the polyester or poly ester carbonate produced possess vastly improved color, as compared to those prepared under reaction conditions described in the prior art. Finally, the use of the processing aid prevents the occurrence of undesirable hot spots which produce colored degradation products which contribute to the color and instability of the polyester or polyester carbonate . The present invention is directed to a process for the preparation of a polyester or a poly ester carbonate which process comprises reacting a dihydric phenol with an aromatic diacid and a diaryl carbonate in the presence of from about 10 to about 60 weight percent, based on the weight of the polyester or poly ester carbonate produced, of a processing aid, under polyester or poly ester carbonate forming conditions.

The polyester or poly ester carbonate may be prepared by adding the dihydric phenol, aromatic diacid, diaryl carbonate, processing aid, and optionally catalyst to a reaction zone and carrying out the polymerization. Any combination of adding the dihydric phenol, the aromatic diacid, diaryl carbdnate, processing aid, and optionally catalyst, to a reaction vessel may be used. The polymerization process of this invention is carried out under polyester or poly ester carbonate forming conditions, i.e., at a temperature of from about 200 to about 3500C., and preferably, from about 250 to about 3300C. The polymerization process in generally conducted in an inert atmosphere such as argon or nitrogen so that the oxygen content therein is minimized or eliminated. The process is preferably carried out at a pressure sufficient to have the processing aid refluxing at the reaction temperature. This pressure is generally atmospheric. Lower and higher pressures may also be used. The polymerization reaction is conducted for a period of time sufficient to produce a polyester or a poly ester carbonate , having a reduced viscosity of at least about 0.1 to greater than 1.0 dl gm, which time is generally less than about 10 hours. The reaction time is generally in the range of from about 4 hours to about 8 hours, depending on the particular polyester or polyester carbonate being prepared. The polymerization reaction of this invention may be carried out batchwise or continuously and by using any apparatus desired. The diacids and diaryl carbonate may be prereacted first, then the dihydric phenol added or the dihydric phenol and diaryl carbonate can be prereacted and then the diacids added. The process of this invention produces polyesters or poly ester carbonates having a reduced viscosity of from about 0.1 to greater than about 1.0, preferably from about 0.2 to about 0.8 dl gm, as measured in chloroform 0.5 g dl chloroform or other suitable solvent at 250C or another suitable temperature. In those instances where the polyester or poly ester carbonate is not soluble in chloroform, other solvents known in the art, such as para chlorophenol, phenol tetrachloroethane 60 40 , and the like, may be used. Reduced viscosities of the polyesters or polyester carbonate measured in these solvents generally have the same range as those measured in chloroform. The polyesters or poly ester carbonates may be prepared in the presence of additives such as molecular weight regulators, antioxidants, and the like. In another embodiment of this invention the polymerization reaction can be carried out in the presence of one or more thermoplastic polymers such as polyesters, polycarbonates, styrene polymers, alkyl acrylate polymers, polyurethanes, poly aryl ether polymers, polyamides, polyimides, poly amide imides , poly ether imides , polyhydroxy ether polymers, copolyetherester block copolymers, and the like to produce novel polymeric materials.

EXAMPLES The following examples serve to give specific illustrations of the practice of this invention but they are not intended in any way to limit the scope of this invention. Example 1 A three neck 250 milliliter round bottom flask was equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a nitrogen inlet and a vacuum jacketed vigreux column with a distillation head and receiver. The flask was charged with 8.30 g 0.050 moles of isophthalic acid, 8.30 g 0.050 moles of terephthalic acid, 22.80 g 0.100 moles of bisphenol A, 43.23 g 0.202 moles of diphenyl carbonate and 23.87 g of diphenyl ether. The reaction system was flushed with nitrogen for 1 hour at room temperature about 250C . While maintaining a constant nitrogen purge, 0.04 g of tetra n butyl titanate was added to the mixture and the reaction was heated to 2500C. Phenol began to distill. After 1 hour at 2500C, the reaction temperature was raised to 2800C where it was allowed to remain for an additional 5 hours.Upon cooling to room temperature the reaction mixture was dissolved in 200 ml of methylene chloride. Coagulation in 1000 ml of methanol resulted in the percipitation of the polyester as a white powder. After several methanol washes, the polymer was dried in a vacuum oven for about 12 hours at 120at. The reduced viscosity of the dried polymer was measured in chloroform 0.50 g 100 ml at 250C and found to be 0.17 dl g. Example 2 The proceedure described in Example 1 was repeated exactly except that di trimethylsilyloxy di n butyl tin was used instead of the tetra n butyl titanate. The resulting polymer had a reduced viscosity of 0.17 dl g. Example 3 The proceedure described in Example 1 was repeated exactly except that di trimethylsilyloxy di n butyl tin was used instead of tetra n butyl titanate and 1,3,5 trimethoxy benzene was used instead of diphenyl ether. The resulting polymer had a reduced viscosity of 0.18 dl g. In all instances higher molecular weight product could be obtained by removing the processing aid and phenol under seduced pressure at temperatures of between about 250 and 350 C. This could be accomplished in the reactor or in an extruder for example in a vented extruder. In the case of the polymers prepared in Example 1 to 3, prior to dissolving them in methylene chloride a small sample of each was heated in a test tube at a pressure of 0.2 mm of Hg at 3000C for 1 hour. Following the standard work described in Example 1 the reduced viscosity of each was measured. The results are shown in Table I.
