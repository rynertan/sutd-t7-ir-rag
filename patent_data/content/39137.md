## Description
This invention relates to isocyanate reactions, to heat induced reactions of organic isocyanates, and in particular to improved methods for the incorporation of an accelerator for a heat induced reaction of an organic isocyan ate. Organic isocyanates undergo a number of heat induced reactions which are of commercial importance.As examples may be mentioned reactions of organic isocyanates with alcohols, water, amines, acids, ureas, urethanes and phenols and reactions such as dimerisation, trimerisation, polymerisation, and carbodiimide formation.Many of these reactions conveniently take place in the presence of an accelerator which is a catalyst for the reaction concerned. However, in commercial practice there is frequently a delay between the incorporation of the accelerator and the start of the heat induced reaction stage. The present invention seeks to reduce the adverse effects of premature reaction resulting from such a delay. According to the present invention there is provided an improved method for the incorporation of an accelerator for a heat induced reaction of a1 organic isocyanate which comprises providing the accelerator in the form of an admixture with a solid medium having a melting point below the temperature of the heat induced reaction stage. The present invention is of particular relevance to the use of organic isocyanates for the bonding of lignocellulosic materials to produce sheets or moulded bodies referred to hereinafter as particle board . In the manufacture of particleboard, the organic isocyanate may be applied to the lignocellulosic material as a liquid isocyanate, as a solution in an organic solvent as described for example in United Kingdom Patent Specification Vo 1148016 or as an aqueous emulsion as described for example in United Kingdom Patent Specification No.1523601 .The impregnated mass of lignocellulosic material is then hot pressed to induce reaction of the organic isocyanate with the lignocellulosic material and the water which is present1 thereby consolidating the mass and orming the particle board. In commercial mass production of particleboard, any reduction in the duration of the process stages is of great benefit, and it is highly desirable therefore to obtain a exhort hot pressing cycle. Accelerators which are catalysts for the isocyanate reactions which take place during the hot pressing stage are well known. However1 such accelerators have not hitherto found application in the manufacture of particle board because of the delays which are always encountered in practice between the application of the organic isocyanate binder to the lignocellulosic material and the start of the hot pressing stage.Such delays may commonly be of several hours duration, and during this period premature reaction of the organic isocyanate in the presence of the accelerator may give rise to an undesirable reduction in the effective level of organic isocyanate available for bonding. Furthermore, many of the available accelerators are basic materials, and such bases are rapidly neutralised in contact with the acidic lignocellulosic material. The present invention therefore seeks to provide a method for the incorporation of an accelerator such that the accelerator system is of low activity at normal temperatures, hut is activated at the elevated temperatures encountered during the hot pressing cycle. According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for the manufacture of particleboard which comprises hot pressing a mass of lignocellulosic material mixed with an organic isocyanate binder in the presence of an accelerator wherein the accelerator is in the form of an admixture with a solid medium having a melting point below the temperature of the hnt pressing stage. The organic isocyanate may be an isocyanate conventionally used as a binder for the manufacture of particleboard. Su h organic isocyanates are listed for example in United Kingdom Patent Specification No.1523601.An especially preferred organic isocyanate is the crude mixture of methylene bridged polyphenyl polyisocyanates which is generally known as crude MDI . The accelerator may be any catalyst which promotes the complex series of reactions which take place during the hot pressing stage between the organic isocyanate and the lignocellulosic material in the presence of water.Such catalysts are well known see for example. Polyurethanes,Chemistry and Tec nclogy , Part I by J.H.Saunders andK.C.Frisch published by Interscience Publishers 1962,Chapter IV . Especially preferred accelerators are amines, and especially tertiary amines, for example triethylamine and triethylenediamine DABCO , and organometallic compounds, for example compounds of iron and tin such as dibutyl tin dilaurate and stannous octoate. The solid medium having a melting point below the temperature of the hot pressing stage may be any convenient solid material which does not adversely affect the reaction of the organic isocyanate. Especially preferred is a wax material such as is commonly added during the manufacture of particle board as a sizing agent. The accelerator may be brought into admixture with the solid material in a variety of ways, for example the accelerator may be dispersed or dissolved in a melt of the solid material for example molten wax . This melt may be sprayed directly onto the lignocellulosic material where it solidifies to form the admixture of the accelerator and the solid medium. The weight ratio of accelerator to solid medium is suitably in the range 0.1 100 to 1 2, preferably from 1 5 to 1 20. Alternatively, the accelerator may be dispersed or dissolved in a melt of the solid material which is then formed into an aqueous dispersion in which solid particles of the admixture of the solid material and the accelerator are dispersed throughout the aqueous medium.Such dispersions suitably have a solids content of from 10 to 90 , preferably from 40 to 6c ,by weight. Waxes may readily be formed into aqueous dispersions for example from the melt , and the aqueous dispersion thus formed is especially convenient for spraying onto the lignocellulosic material. Preferably the accelerator is soluble in a melt of the solid material, and if for example a wax is used as the solid material, preferred accelerators include dibutyl tin dilaurate and long alkyl chain tertiary amines, for example a long alkyl chain dimethyl tertiary amine. The long chain alkyl group may for example contain from 10 to 20 carbon atoms. The hot pressing stage of the manufacture of particleboard conventionally takes place at from 140 to 2200C. Preferably the melting point of the solid medium for example the wax is from 20 to 10000 below the hot pressing stage temperature, provided of course that the medium is solid at room temperature. In this way, the accelerator, which is wholly or partly deactivated when in admixture with the solid medium, is released during the hot pressing stage of the particle board manufacture, thereby reducing the duration of the hot pressing cycle. The invention is illustrated but not limited by the following Examples in which all parts and percentages are by weight. Example 1 An aqueous dispersion was prepared of paraffin wax in which dibutyl tin dilaurate was encapsulated. The dispersion had a solids content of 56 and the ratio of wax to dibutyl tin dilaurate was 10 1. An emulsifiable isocyanate was prepared by reacting 3 parts of methoxy polyethylene glycol molecular weight 650 with 97 parts of crude MDI having an NCO content of 30 and containing approximately 50 of diphenylmethane diisocyanates, the remainder being polymethylene polyphenyl polyisocyanates of higher functionality. An aqueous emulsion was prepared by adding 102 g of the emulsifiable isocyanate to 152 g of water and emulsifying using a Silverson blender, the wax catalyst dispersion 42 g then being added and stirred in. The glue mix was then applied to wood furnish by spraying in a rotor blender, 1740 g of 5 mesh particle size of spruce pine 50 50 moisture content 2.C being used as the furnish.A mat was then prepared by placing a Perspex frame of internal dimensions 40.5 cr x 40.5 cm x 15 cm on to an aluminium caul plate which had been coated with release agent. The glued chips were spread in using a snowing technique so that the wood particles were deposited predominantly in the horizontal plane On completion of the sprinkling of the particles, the uneven surface was evened out by combing with a flat piece of plastic. The mat was then prepressed by using plywood of the appropriate dimensions and hand pressing. The Perspex frame was carefully removed and the bottom caul plate and mat were placed on the bottom platen of the preheated press 1750C followed by a top caul plate and steel spacers 19 rmn coated with release agent. The press platens were closed over a period of 30 seconds, a ram pressure of 1000 psi being maintained the cross sectional area of the ram being 113 square inches for a total of 4 minutes 45 seconds i.e. 15 secs mm. The board was then removed frown the press, stacked for 24 hours prior to transfer to a constant humidity and temperature room 50 temperature 230C and stored for 7 days prior to testing. The results of the evaluation are given in Table 1. Example 2 The procedure of EXample 7 was followed except that the press time was reduced to 3 minutes 29 seconds i.e. 11 secs mm. The results of the evaluation are as given in Table 1.Examples 3 and 4 The procedure of sample 2 was followed except that the waxgoatalyst dispersion was replaced by the same amount of water as in the dispersion 18.5 g . On reioval from the press, the board delaminated showing insufficient cure had occurred. It was necessary to increase the press time to 3 minutes 48 seconds i.e. 12 sec mm to obtain similar physical properties to that obtained in Example 2. The results of the evaluation are as given in Table 1. Example 5 The procedure of Example 1 was followed except that the catalyst was added to the diisocyanate. In preparation of the.emulsion with water1 frothing reaction occurred almost immediately, preventing the emulsion being applied to the wood chip via the spray technique. The advantages of having a catalyst present in an encapsulated form and the advantages of having a catalyst present in the preparation of particle board can be seen from the above experiments, i.e. a Without encapsulating the catalyst, frothing of the emulsion occurs almost immediately on prepdration of the emulsion and hence the advantages of the emulsion technique better distribution of the glue cannot be used. Examples 1 and 5 . b The catalyst increases the rate of reaction on the particle board Examples 2, 3 and 4 .
