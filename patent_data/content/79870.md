# Hydraulic valve means.

## Abstract
A valve means for controlling a linear or rotary hydraulic motor, which is connected to a pump P acting as pressure medium source via the valve means, and to a tank T either directly or via a valve means. Known valve means of this kind comprise valves with valve slides, which control both the supply of pressure medium to the motor and the return flow from the same. These valves, however, do not always satisfy the demand in question, owing to internal leakage which, for example, implies that a linear motor is caused to carry out undesired movements. The present valve means, however, comprises at least one seat valve C located in a main flow connection between the pump P and one port A of the motor, where each seat valve C for adjusting the flow in the main flow connection to the motor 1 is controlled by a pilot flow, which is adjustable by a pilot valve E and originates from the main flow through the seat valve C , and which after the pilot valve E returns to the main flow at a point after the seat valve C , seen in the flow direction.
