## Description
NON AQUEOUS COMPOSITIONS,METHOD OF MAKING THEM ,USE THEREOF AS OR IN ADHESIVES,AND ARTICLE ADHERED THEREWITHThis invention concerns non aqueous compositions, a method of making them, the use of the compositions as or in adhesives and an article adhered by the compositions.The invention more particularly concerns non aqueous compositions that can be easily mixed and spread, which compositions are based on sequential polymer, essentially non flammable acrylic monomer, free radical generator and optionally polymerization accelerator. These compositions may be 100 reactive fluid adhesive compositions, that is compositions which are free of solvents including water, and may displayBingham plastic rheology as well as having attractively low odour and toxicity. The compositions are useful in joining metallic surfaces and bonding high pressure plastic laminate to wood and wood derived products.Although many combinations of monomer, polymer, and polymerization catalysts have been proposed as 300 reactive fluid adhesives, such adhesive compositions generally have serious disadvantages. Firstly, if a low molecular weight monomer is used to facilitate dispersion or solution of the polymer, the monomer frequently contributes odour, flammability, and toxicity to the adhesive composition. Secondly, if a relatively high molecular weight monomer is used, it is very often a poor dispersing medium or a poor solvent for the polymer. Mixing such compositions may also be difficult and the flammable monomer may be hazardous if heat is applied to help disperse the polymer or is developed in the course of the dispersion process.After mixing, such known polymer in monomer compositions often have a rubbery, stringy or ropy consistency which makes them difficult to spread. This consistency results from the solubilization of the polymer by the monomer and concomitant generation of polymer chain entanglement crosslinksl . Examples of such odorous and flammable or difficult to prepare compositions are described inU.S.Patents No. 3,832,274 methyl methacrylate and nitrile rubber , 4,052,244 hydroxypropyl acrylate and acrylic rubber , 3,644,569 styrene and polyurethane , 3,B90,J4O7 methyl methacrylate and chlorosulfonated polyethylene ,4,226,954 auryl methacrylate and chlorosulfonated polyethylene and 4,126,504 acrylic rubber, methyl methacrylate and acrylic acid .Adhesive compositions comprising a thermoplastic, nonreactive elastomeric polymer dissolved in an addition polymerizable combination of acrylic or methacrylic monomer and a free radical polymerization catalyst system are well known in the art. For example U.S. Patent No.11,126,504 describes such a composition. However, this type of composition suffers from the limitation that the monomer or monomer mixture must be chosen such that the non reactive thermoplastic polymer will be soluble therein. This limitation restricts the use of the high flash point monomers. In contrast thereto, in the present invention the sequential polymer forms a separate phase dispersed rather than dissolved in the monomer which is polymerized on curing the adhesive. Consequently, high flash point monomers may readily be used.In addition to the difficulties associated with their preparation, several known compositions, especially those containing chlorosulfonated polyethylene or polyvinyl chloride, may tend to corrode metallic substrates. For example, corrosion results from sulfonic acid groups on the polymer chain in chlorosulfonated polyethylene compositions. Similarly, corrosive hydrogen chloride may be produced from dehydrohalogenation of polyvinyl chloridebased adhesive compositions which are used in automobile production, since high temperature bake cycles are often required to cure coatings applied after adhesive application.It is amongst the objects of this invention to provide easily mixed and readily spreadable non aqueous compositions useful as or in adhesives which exhibit desirably low odour, flammability, and toxicity and which can be used to join metal surfaces, plastic surfaces and high pressure plastic laminate to wood or wood derived products. Another object is to prepare compositions exhibiting attractive impact resistance when cured. A further object is to provide adhesive compositions for metal substrates which are less prone to corrode such substrates than compositions containing strongly acidic components.In addition to use as adhesives, the compositions of this invention may be useful in preparing protective coatings for metallic, plastic, and wood surfaces.Accordingly the invention provides a non aqueous composition comprising a acrylic and or methacrylic monomer, including blends of monomers, having a flash point greater than 9500, the monomer being such as to form polymer with a glass transition temperature from OOC to 10000, b sequential polymer, dispersed in a comprising at least 25 by weight of an elastomeric stage and at least 5 by weight of an outermost rigid stage, and c free radical generator.Preferably a comprises at least one monomeric ester of acrylic or methacrylic acid, b comprises two stage core shell polymer and c comprises at least one compound which thermally dissociates at a temperature from OOC to 1000C to yield peroxide or hydroperoxide free radicals.The composition may include at least one amino polymerization accelerator. The useful monomer is characterised by a flash point of greater than 9500 preferably as measured by ASTM D 3278 Set a Flash Closed Cup Method. The monomer is such as to form homopolymer or copolymer with a Tg in the stated range. Amongst preferred monomer are acryloyloxypropionic acid AOPA ,acryloyloxypropoyloxypropionic acid AO2PA , and the corresponding higher oligomers of the formula CH2 CHC02 CH2CH2C02 n where n is greater than 2 AOnPAs , dicyclopentenyloxyethyl methacrylate DCPOEMA which is described inU.S. Patent No.4,097,677 , hydroxypropyl methacrylate HPMA , and or isodecyl methacrylate IDMA . The glass transition temperature T of polymers is a g conventional criterion of polymer hardness and is described by Floy,Principles of Polymer chemistry, Cornell UniversityPress, 1953 at pp 56 57. The Tg of a copolymer of any specific composition can be approximately calculated from the Tug 15 of the corresponding homopolymer Fox, Bull. Am. Physics Soc., 1,3, at p 123 1956 and from glass transition temperature Factor tables well known to the polymer chemist such as Rohm and Haas acrylic glass temperature analyser, publication No.CM 24 4 76. Only the normal skill and knowledge of such a chemist being required to predict the Tg of a given polymer and to select monomers and their proportions to achieve a polymer of desired Tg.Sequential polymer b may coprise multistage core shell polymers such as those described in U.S. Patents No.3,678, 133, 3,985,703, 3,985,704, 4,200,567 and 4,306,040. Such preferred core shell polymers contain a crosslinked acrylic or butadiene based elastomeric core phase polymer with a T of less than 100C. This core phase polymer g is graft linked to an outermost rigid thermoplastic stage. Additional alternating stages of elastomeric and rigid phase may then be subsequently graft linked to the initial two phase polymer particles. The outermost rigid stage preferably has a Tg of greater than 700C. The sequential polymer may contain from 25 to 95 by weight of elastomeric stage and from 75 to 5 by weight of an outermost rigid stage. The sequential polymer is most preferably free flowing, readily dispersed powder which can be stirred into the monomer without heat or excessive agitation. Examples of sequential polymers that may be used as component b are given in Table 1. The abbreviations used in Table 1 for individual monomers are defined in Table 2.In the monomer compositions given in Table 1, a single slash between abbreviations is used to denote components of a single stage and a double slash is used to separate the sequential stages.

The amount of free radical generator c is preferably between 1 and 4 weight percent of the total composition.Amongst the optional amino polymerization accelerators are preferably N,N dimethylaniline DMA , N,N dimethyl ptoluidine DMT , N,N bis 2 hydroxyethyl p toluidine HET , and condensates of butyraldehyde and aniline or butylamine available from R.T.Vanderbilt Company under the names Vanax 808 and Vanax 833 respectively. The weight of accelerator if used is preferably 2 to 4 percent of the total composition. The free radical generator or the accelerator or both may be present in the bulk of the composition.However, it is preferred that either the free radical generator or the accelerator be present in the bulk of the composition and that the other be applied to one or both of the substrates to be adhered prior to application of the bulk of the composition. This effectively lengthens the storage stability. When solid free radical generators are used as surfaceactivators, that is, when they are applied to the surface or surfaces of the substrates and the accelerator is included in the bulk of the composition, it is preferred that the solid free radical generator is dissolved or dispersed in chlorinated solvents such as methylene chloride or in plasticizers such as dibutyl phthalate.As used throughout the specification and claims of this application monomer includes ester s of acrylic or methacrylic acid, free radical generator means a compound capable of generating free radicals, amino polymerization accelerator includes compounds from the following N,N di C1 C6 alkyl andN,N di mono hydroxy substituted C1 C4 alkylarylamines and condensates of butyraldehyde and aniline and condensates of butyraldehyde and butylamine.The compositions of this invention can be made by sifting sequential polymer powder s into monomer while stirring the monomer at room temperature. All other components of the composition can then be added with continued stirring.In order that the invention may be more clearly understood the following examples are given as embodiments of the invention. EXAMPLE 1 Into a monomer mixture consisting of 35 parts by weight of the total composition of hydroxypropyl methacrylate, 25 parts by weight of dicyclopentenyloxyethyl methacrylate, 10 parts by weight of acryloyloxvpropionic acid, is sifted 30 parts by weight of sequential polymer No. 22 of Table 1 above with mechanical stirring. Subsequently, 3 parts per weight of cumene hydroperoxide was mixed into the composition. Prior to application, a thin coating ofVanax 808 was spread over both surfaces to be joined. EXAMPLES 2 11 In a similar manner Examples 2 11 of Table 3 were prepared.METALLIC SUBSTRATE ADHESION. Lap shear test joints were prepared from 25nun x 102mn x 1.6mn test coupons of steel No. RS 14 from QPanel Company and aluminum No. AD 13 from Q PanelCompany . Vanax polymerization accelerators were then spread thinly over the area of the test surfaces to be joined. Adhesive compositions were pressed by hand between the treated surfaces to give a bond measuring 25mm x 13mum x O.25mm. Subsequent to room temperature polymerization, the test specimens formed in this manner were tested for lap tensile shear strength at a separation rate of 1.3mum per min. by ASTM Method D 1002 72. These tests were made after. various aging periods at room temperature or under other conditions. Similar test specimens were prepared and tested for impact resistance by ASTM Method G14 77 Falling Weight Test . Examples l il of Table 3 indicate that the adhesive compositions of the present invention are useful for adhering metal to metal. In general, 2,000 psi 14 AlPa is accepted in the art as an adequate level of lap tensile shear strength. Examples 5 and 6 significantly exceed this level. Example 11, prepared without sequential polymer, but including a small amount Of fumed silica for thickening, indicates that without sequential polymer far less strength is exhibited. A comparison of the lap shear strength on aluminum after 4 weeks in 380C water of Example 5. with Example 7 suggests that the hydrophobic monomer DCPOERLA tends to impart water resistance to the adhesive bond. A comparison of the impact resistance of Examples 5 and 7 with that of 9, 10, and 11 indicate that inclusion of a significant amount of sequential copolymer here 30 , imparts impact resistance to the adhesive bond. A falling ball impact resistance of 72 in. lb. 8N m is recognized as adequate. The impact resistances of Examples 5 and 6 exceed this level. according to the invention The physical form of the ompositions is known as a Bingham plastic which is characterized by a yield stress. Yield stress is significant in the application of adhesive compositions. An upper limit of yield stress defines spreadability, and a lower limit defines the condition for preventing leakage of the adhesive from the parts being joined.Consistencies between mayonnaise and butter are preferred. Yield stress was measured with a Brookfield ModelRVF Viscometer by the inethod described by Bowles et al on p. 140 in the November 1955 issue of ModernPlastics, Example 2 in Table 3 has a yield stress af 2100 Pa. Examples 16 and 18 in Table 5 below have yield stresses of 1500 and 2800 Pa. respectively. EXAMPLES 12 15 It is often necessary when adhesive compositions are to be used in parts assembly that an adhesive bond strong enough to allow handling of the assembled parts be formed quickly. Rapid formation of the bond tends to eliminate the necessity of clamping the parts together thus simplifying the assembly operation d ultimately reducing costs. The time required for an adhesive bond to form between the parts to be assembled is called the fixturing time. Examples 12 i5 of Table 4 compare the lap tensile shear strength on steel after short periods of aging of the adhesive compositions ofExamples 5 8. A comparison among the examples indicates that a wide range of variation in itrin time can be obtained with the compositions of tis invention.For example the tensile shear strength a 10 minutes of Example 12 is about 10 times greater than that of Example 13. The significant variation in fixturing time is desirable because in some applications it may be important to have adequate time to position and reposition parts before a bond cures.In such cases a relatively slowly polymerizing adhesive is preferred.

N,N dimethyl p toluidine surface activator was spread thinly over the back side of the plastic laminate and over one side of the particle board or plywood. The adhesive carpositions of Examples 16 19 were prepared as described inExample 1 above and were spread on the activated surface of the particle board or plywood at about 75g m2. The activated side of the plastic laminate was then pressed by hand onto the adhesive to form a bonded area of 25mm x 25mm.In the first few minutes after forming the bond, a slight shearing action was imposed by hand to determine the fixturing time. after aging 4 days at 25 C the plastic laminate was clamped in one jaw of a tensile tester and the particle board or plywood was clamped in the other jaw. The lap shear resistance was determined at a separation rate of Srrm min. Test specimens for hot static cleavage resistance were prepared as described above except that the bonded area between the plastic laminate and plywood was 25mm x 51mm. These test specimens were suspended horizontally in an oven at 700Cwith a plastic laminate coupon on the under side and a 500 g weight hanging from the free end of the coupon. The time required for the plastic coupon plus weight to fall was recorded. Examples 16 19 of Table 5 show that the lap shear adhesion of these adhesive ccrrpositions was greater than abqut 200 psi 1.4 MPa . 200 psi is recognized as an adequate level of lap shear adhesion for this application. The same examples also show substantial resistance to cleavage failure at 70 C.
