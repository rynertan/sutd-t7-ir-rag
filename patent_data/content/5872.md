# Means for water bottom logging.

## Abstract
The apparent electrical resistivities of various parts of a marine bottom 3 are determined by supplying an alternating electrical current to a pair of current supply electrodes and measuring potential differences between pairs of measuring locations. The locations are on a straight line on the marine bottom. There is a fixed ratio between the distance between the locations of each pair and the distance between said pair and the pair of current supply locations. Adjoining pairs of measuring locations have a measuring location in common. A flexible cable 1 for taking these measurements is described. The determined resistivities are subsequently compared with calculated resistivities to determine the compositions and thicknesses of the soil layers 4, 5 of the marine bottom.
