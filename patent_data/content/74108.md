# Cooker with heating control system.

## Abstract
A highly automationed cooking apparatus especially suitable for stew cooking or the like liable to boiling over. Temperature of outer bottom face of a pan is measured by a sensor and temperature gradients are sampling measured at a sampling time pitch. Boiling point of food material is detected by finding a decrease of the temperature gradient, and thereafter the heating is lowered to avoid boiling over to a suitable value which is given by processing the tempera ture gradients.
