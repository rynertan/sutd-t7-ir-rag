## Description
The present invention relates to amide derivatives of 2 p aminobenzyl butyric acid and esters thereof having the general formula 1 wherein or R is a hydrogen atom and R represents a group and R is a hydrogen atom or a 1 to 6 C alkyl group, preferably an ethyl group. Said compounds can all be structurally derivatives from 2 p aminobenzyl butyric acid through amidation of the amine group and they form a novel class of hypocholesterolemizing and hypolipidemizing agents. Drugs having a hypolipidemizing activity are known. Among these Fenbutyramide, Xenbucin and β benzal butyric acid can be cited, having the formula, respectively The above drugs however show a low activity. It is also known from the literature Chapman J. M. et al, J. Med. Chem. It is also known that Bezafibrate and Clofibrate have the ability to decrease the hematic levels of cholesterol and triglycerides see R. Zimmerman et al Atherosclerosis Among the phthalimide derivatives, o N phthalimido acetophenone has been found to be more active than Clofibrate in reducing the serum cholesterol percentage and the triglyceride level. The o N phthalimido acetophenone activity appears to occur possibly in various ways, of which the inhibiting activity in vivo is cited on the hepatic enzymes involved in the biosynthesis Additional hypolipidemizing drugs of interest are Procetofene of formula as well as the compound which show a hypolipidemizing activity lower than that of Bezafibrate. GB patent 1 484 848 describes phenyl alkane carboxylic acid derivatives. The compounds of the present invention are all derivatives with respect to the carboxylic group.

Analysis From tests effected with amide derivatives of 2 p aminobenzyl butyric acid and the esters thereof corresponding to the general formula 1 , it results that such compounds have pharmacological properties suitable for therapeutic utilization in some pathological conditions. In particular the experimental tests have been effected with the compounds 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 . The preparations administered in vivo by oral route, comprise a 0.5 suspension of carboxymethylcellulose in a neutral pH normal physiological saline for the compounds 3 , 4 and 5 , while for the compounds 2 and 6 the preparation comprises a solution in NaOH 0.1N at pH 7 7.5. The compounds of the invention have shown a high hypolipidemizing activity. This pharmacotherapeutic effect was obtained with dosages and methods of administration which have not caused significant toxic effects. The hypolipidemizing activity was compared with Bezafibrate and Clofibrate. The hypolipidemizing activity of the substances under test was evaluated as the ability to decrease the hematic levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol in animals made hyperlipidemic by administration of Triton antihyperlipidemic agents, J. N. Moss, Screening Methods in Pharmacology, Ed. Robert A. Turner and P. Hebborn, volume II, Academic Press, pages 121 143 . The test was carried out on two animal species rat and mouse. Male Wistar rats and Swiss mice were used, held at a normal diet, the former weighing 200 260 g, the latter weighing about 26 30 g. The compounds 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 and the Bezafibrate and Clofibrate of control were administered per os at a dose of 500 mg kg, simultaneously with a 10 solution in normal saline of Triton WR 1339 endoperitoneally at a rate of 2 ml kg body weight. After treatment, the animals were divided into lots of eight, and held fasting for 18 hours and then sacrificed. The hematic levels of triglycerides total cholesterol are measured on the serum by enzymatic methods Test Combination Triglycerides,Boehring Mannheim GmbH and and colorimetric methods Test Combination Cholesterol, Boehring Mannheim GmbH . The results on the hypolipedimizing activity of the compounds under test in rat and mouse are referred in tables I and II. DL₅₀ was evaluated after administration of the compounds 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 alone in male albine Swiss mice weighing 27 3 g, using the oral route. The animals were held under observation by checking the mortality and pain signs, if any, for 15 days. The DL₅₀ values mg kg are referred in table III. The data referred in tables I, II show the pharmacotherapeutic effect of the amide derivatives of 2 p aminobenzyl butyric acid and esters thereof, which are the object of the present invention. The compounds 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 show an interesting ability to decrease the hematic levels of cholesterol and triglycerides within the tested dosages and with respect to the control products. The low toxicity table III of said compounds gives them a high therapeutic index. Indeed the acute toxicity values are by several factors higher than the values used for reaching pharmaceutically active dosages. At the dosages and with the methods used and specified in the above tests, the administration to healthy animals has not brought about mortality at a long or short term, nor evidence of toxic effects. The results referred in tables I, II and III document the therapeutic interest of a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention. The patients in need of a hypolipidemizing and hypocholesterolemizing pharmaceutical treatment will be orally administered with a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of a compound of formula 1 . The dosage of this compound will generally be comprised between about 200 and about 600 mg kg body weight day, although larger and smaller dosages can be administered by having regard to the age, weight and general conditions of the patient. The compounds according to the invention can be administered in the form of tablets, capsules, solutions, suspensions, together with pharmaceutically compatible, non toxic carriers and eccipients.
