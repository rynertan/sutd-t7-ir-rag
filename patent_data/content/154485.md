## Description
The present invention generally relates to video signal recording and or reproducing apparatuses having a function of carrying out assembled recordings, and more particularly to a video signal recording and or reproducing apparatus which carries out an assembled recording by once stopping the recording operation, moving a tape in a reverse direction over a predetermined distance and then resuming the tape travel in a forward direction so as to start a new recording in continuance with a previous recording. The video signal recording and or reproducing apparatus according to the present invention is designed to minimize an overlap between the previous recording and the new recording. Generally, in a video signal recording and or reproducing apparatus and especially in a video signal recording and or reproducing apparatus which records an image picked up video signal from a television camera on a tape, the apparatus is frequently operated in such a manner that the recording operation is temporarily stopped during the recording operation and the recording operation is resumed thereafter. It is common to operate the apparatus in this manner when using a portable television camera and recording the image picked up video signal on the tape by a portable recording and or reproducing apparatus. When the power source switch is turned OFF in order to temporarily stop the recording operation while recording the image picked up video signal from the television camera related to a certain picture, rotary heads stop rotating and the tape stops traveling. Thus, the tape which is drawn out of a cassette and is loaded into a predetermined tape path within the apparatus when the recording is started, is drawn back into the cassette and is unloaded. Hence, when the mode of the apparatus is set to the recording mode and the tape is drawn out of the cassette and is loaded into the predetermined tape path so as to resume the recording of the image picked up video signal related to another picture, the tape position with respect to the heads before the tape unloading operation will not accurately coincide with the tape position after the tape is loaded again to resume the recording operation. Accordingly, when the recording operation is resumed after carrying out the tape unloading and loading operations as described above, an unrecorded part may be formed on the tape between a previously recorded part and a newly recorded part, or an overlapping part may be formed on the tape when the recording is resumed from a part overlapping the previously recorded part. In order to eliminate the unwanted deviation in the tape position introduced during the tape unloading and loading operations, the tape is maintained in the state loaded in the predetermined tape path during predetermined modes of the apparatus, that is, measures are taken to prevent the tape from being unloaded during the predetermined modes of the apparatus. However, even when such measures are taken to maintain the tape in the loaded state, the traveling tape does not stop immediately after an operation is carried out to temporarily stop the tape, due to inertia of a tape feeding system. As a result, the tape actually stops after traveling over a certain distance. Further, when resuming the tape travel so as to resume the recording operation, it will take a certain time period for the tape traveling speed to reach a predetermined tape traveling speed. Accordingly, when the recording operation is resumed by simply resuming the tape travel from a position where the tape stopped, stable recording cannot be carried out during the initial period of the resumed recording operation. Thus, when a tape recorded in this manner is played, the servo operation becomes unstable at a joint part between the two recordings, that is, at the part where the recording is temporarily stopped and then resumed thereafter. Therefore, there is a problem in that the reproduced picture will become distorted at the joint part. In addition, when the recording operation is resumed after the tape travel is resumed and the tape traveling speed has reached the predetermined tape traveling speed, an unrecorded part will be formed on the tape between the previously recorded part and the newly recorded part, and the reproduced picture will become unsatisfactory for viewing between the two recording parts. In order to prevent such problems from being introduced when the recording operation is temporarily stopped, a supply reel is automatically rotated in a tape take up direction so as to rewind a predetermined quantity of tape before stopping the tape. By taking such a measure, the tape traveling speed will reach the predetermined tape traveling speed while the tape travel is resumed and the tape travels over a distance approximately corresponding to the rewound quantity of tape, when the recording operation is resumed. Moreover, the new recording can be carried out satisfactorily in continuance with the previously recorded part when the recording operation is resumed after the tape traveling speed has reached the predetermined tape traveling speed. The assembled recording in which the recording operation is once stopped, the tape is moved in the reverse direction over a predetermined distance and stopped, and the tape is then moved in the forward direction and the new recording is started after the tape has traveled in the forward direction over the predetermined distance, is disclosed in a British Patent Application No.8313040, German Patent Applications P 32 30 001.8 and P 33 18 676.6, and a French Patent Application No.83 08295, in which the applicant is the same as the applicant of the present application, for example. When rewinding the tape over the predetermined distance and stopping the tape after the recording operation is once stopped, and when moving the tape over the predetermined distance and starting the new recording after the tape travel is resumed, the number of control pulses reproduced from the tape is counted in order to detect that the tape has traveled over the predetermined distance. Alternatively, the number of pulses generated from a frequency generator which is coupled to a capstan motor, is counted to detect that the tape has traveled over the predetermined distance. However, the tape traveling speed is extremely low when the tape is being stopped and when the tape is being started to travel. For this reason, the reproduction of the control pulses, the generation of the pulses by the frequency generator, and the counting of the pulses cannot be performed accurately during these times. As a result, it is impossible to accurately detect whether the tape has travelled over the predetermined distance during these times. Accordingly, in order to prevent an unrecorded part from being formed between the end of the previously recorded part and the start of the newly recorded part, the conventional apparatus starts the new recording before the end of the previous recording is reached. In other words, when the tape is rewound over the predetermined distance and the tape travel is then resumed in the forward direction, the new recording is started from a position overlapping a part of the previous recording. For example, in the actual conventional apparatus, this overlap between the previous recording and the new recording on the tape exists over a distance corresponding to three to four the video signal frames. At the overlap between the previous recording and the new recording, the pre recorded signals of the previous recording are substantially erased by the new signals of the new recording, but an interference is introduced in the color signal. Hence, a reproduced picture having a satisfactory picture quality cannot be obtained from the overlap. In order to obtain a reproduced picture having a satisfactory picture quality, it is desirable that the overlap is extremely small or does not exist. However, in the conventional apparatus, the overlap is made intentionally as described before so as to reduce the chances of an unrecorded part being formed between the previous recording and the new recording. DE B 1762922 discloses an electronic editing apparatus for performing insert recording of a video signal. Previously recorded control pulses are reproduced to permit satisfactory insert recording. Thus, the previously recorded control pulses are not erased and no new control pulses are recorded. According to the invention, there is provided a video signal recording and or reproducing apparatus as defined in the appended Claim 1. It is thus to provide a video signal recording and or reproducing apparatus which records a joint indication signal on a control track when the recording operation is once stopped, stops the tape after rewinding the tape over a predetermined distance, resumes the tape travel in a forward direction, and start a new recording when the joint indication signal is reproduced during an assembled recording. Thus, it is possible essentially to eliminate an overlap at a joint between a previous recording and the new recording, and it is thus possible to carry out a satisfactory assembled recording. It is also possible to provide a video signal recording and or reproducing apparatus which changes the duty factor of falling edges of a control signal having rising edges which are essential for controlling the functions of the apparatus, and uses the falling edges having the changed duty factor as the joint indication signal without having to record a special signal as the joint indication signal. The desired assembled recording can be carried out in conformance with the existing standard for home use video tape recorders VTRs , according to which standard no other signal is recorded on the control track besides the control signal. The present invention will be further described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which First, a general description will be given with respect to the assembled recording operation of the video signal recording and or reproducing apparatus hereinafter simply referred to as an apparatus according to the present invention by referring to Figure 1. It will be assumed that the mode of the apparatus is set to a recording mode from a time t₁ and a recording pause switch 23 shown in Figure 2 is turned ON at a time t₂ so as to once stop the recording. As will be described later on in the specification, a joint indication signal is recorded on a control track of a tape during a minute time period between times t₂ and t₃. At the time t₃, the mode of the apparatus is set to a reproducing mode and a capstan rotates in a reverse direction. Hence, the tape is taken up on a supply reel in the state where the tape is loaded in a predetermined tape path, and the tape travels in the reverse direction. While the tape is traveling in the reverse direction, the number of peak values of a frequency signal generated from a frequency generator which is provided on a reel or the capstan is counted. When the count reaches a predetermined value, the rotating reels are stopped. The tape stops traveling at a time t₄. The recording pause switch 23 is turned OFF at a time t₅ when an assembled recording is to be carried out so as to start a new recording in continuance with the previous recording described before. The apparatus assumes the reproducing mode from the time t₅ and the capstan causes the tape to travel in a forward direction. The pre recorded joint indication signal is detected after the tape traveling speed reaches a predetermined tape traveling speed. Due to the detection of the joint indication signal, the mode of the apparatus is switched to the recording mode at a time t₇ and the new recording is started in continuance with the end of the previous recording. According to the apparatus of the present invention, there is essentially no overlap between the previous recording and the new recording because the new recording is started upon reproduction of the pre recorded joint indication signal which is recorded when the previous recording is once stopped. On the other hand, the conventional apparatus counts the reproduced control pulses or the output pulses of the frequency generator after the time t₅, and the measurement of the tape traveling distance is inaccurate. Hence, in order to prevent an unrecorded part from being formed between the previous recording and the new recording, the conventional apparatus is designed to start the new recording from a time t₆ which is before the time t₇. For this reason, an overlap of the previous and new recordings occurs between the times t₆ and t₇ according to the conventional apparatus. However, the apparatus according to the present invention is designed to start the new recording from the time t₇, and thus, there is essentially no overlap between the previous and new recordings. Next, a description will be given with respect to an embodiment of the apparatus according to the present invention by referring to FIG.2. During the recording mode from the time t₁, a drum motor 12 rotates under control of a servo circuit 11 so as to rotate a rotary drum 13 having video heads 14a and 14b mounted at diametrical positions thereof. A capstan motor 15 also rotates under control of the servo circuit 11 so as to rotate a capstan 16. Hence, a magnetic tape 18 is driven in a state pinched between the capstan 16 and a pinch roller 17, and travels at a predetermined traveling speed. A video signal which is to be recorded is applied to an input terminal 19, and is supplied to a video signal processing circuit 21 wherein the video signal is subjected to a predetermined signal processing. The processed video signal from the video signal processing circuit 21 is supplied to the video heads 14a and 14b and is recorded on the traveling tape 18. During the reproducing mode, the signal reproduced from the tape 18 by the video heads 14a and 14b is obtained through an output terminal 20. Depending on the rotation of the motor 12, a drum pulse signal is obtained from a pickup head 22 which opposes a magnet mounted on a rotary shaft of the motor 12. The drum pulse signal is supplied to the servo circuit 11. When the recording pause switch 23 is turned ON at the time t₂ so as to interrupt the recording, a system controller 24 having a built in microcomputer produces a pause signal The output signal A capacitor C₂ and a resistor R₂ are coupled to a monostable multivibrator 28. A connection point between the capacitor C₂ and a resistor R₃ is coupled to the output side of the monostable multivibrator 27 through a diode D₅ and the resistor R₂. A control signal The timings with which the output signals g₁ and g₂ hereinafter also generally referred to as a signal After the time T₁ elapses from the rise in the signal Next, when the recording pause switch 23 is turned OFF at the time t₅, the system controller 24 supplies a forward rotation command signal to the servo circuit 11. Thus, the motor 15 rotates in the forward direction and the tape 18 starts to travel in the forward direction. In this state, the signal applied to the amplifier 19 from the system controller 24 still assumes the low level, and the amplifier 19 remains in the deactivated state. A signal The signal The output signal The system controller 24 which receives the signal The assembled recording of the new video signal is started by detecting the pre recorded joint indication signal which is recorded when the recording is interrupted. Hence, a relatively long overlap will not be formed between the previous recording and the new recording as in the case of the conventional apparatus. According to the apparatus of the present invention, even when an overlap does occur between the previous recording and the new recording, the length of the overlap on the tape 18 is short and corresponds to approximately one video signal frame at the maximum. Hence, the new recording can be made in satisfactory continuance with the previous recording. After the signal Numerical examples of the capacitances and resistances of the resistors and capacitors and the time constants of the circuit shown in FIG.2 are given below. The timing with which the control signal rises is originally used to control the functions of the apparatus during the reproducing mode. In the embodiment described heretofore, the timing with which the control signal falls, which timing is not essential to control the functions of the apparatus during the reproducing mode, is made different from the regular timing. In other words, the timing with which the control signal falls is made different from that of the regular control signal g₁ and is made the same as that of the signal g₁. The joint indication signal is detected by detecting the point when the timing with which the control signal falls changes. For this reason, it is unnecessary to record a special indication signal on the control track. Hence, the embodiment can be applied to a standard recording format in which no signal is recorded on the control track besides the control signal. However, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment, and an independent joint indication signal may be recorded on the control track besides the control signal.
