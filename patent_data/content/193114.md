## Description
Laminated productBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a novel laminated product, more particularly to a laminated product excellent in heat resistance, mechanical strength, solvent resistance, flame retardancy and molding workability.As the material for electronic and electrical instruments or mechanical parts, laminated products obtained by impregnating and curing a thermosetting resin into a cloth or a mat comprising glass fibers or carbon fibers have been well known in the art.However, in production of the above laminated products, it will take a long time for heat treatment for curing of a thermosetting resin, which is disadvantageous in industrial application. Also, in the manufacturing steps, a solvent is required to be used to bring about worsening of the working environment, and besides the step for recovery of the solvent employed is also required.In order to cancel the problems of thermosetting resins as described above, it has been proposed to use a thermoplastic resin as the constituent material of a laminated product in place of thermosetting resins.However, of thermoplastic resins, for example, a crosslinked polyethylene is inferior in heat resistance, a polytetrafluoroethylene is inferior in molding workability, and a polyphenyleneoxide is unsatisfactory in heat resistance and chemical resistance, thus possessing respective drawbacks, and therefore they were unsuitable as the constituent resin of a laminated product in the field of uses wherein heat resistance and solvent resistance are demanded.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONAn object of this invention is to cancel the above problems and provide a laminated product excellent in heat resistance, mechanical strength, solvent resistance, flame retardancy and molding workability.The laminated product of this invention comprises a layer of a polycyanoaryl ether having 80 mole or more of the recurring unit represented by the formula EMI2.1 wherein Ar represents any one ofEMI2.2 EMI2.3 and a layer of a fibrous reinforcing material laminated on one another. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTSFirst, the polycyanoaryl ether which is a component of the laminated product in this invention contains 80 mole or more of the recurring unit represented by the above formula I .If the content of the recurring unit represented by the formula I is less than 80 mole , the laminated product obtained will be lowered in heat resistance and mechanical strength.Also, the polycyanoaryl ether to be used in this invention may be a copolymer containing 20 mole or less of at least one recurring unit represented by the formula II shown below, in addition to 80 mole or more of the recurring unit represented by the formula I EMI3.1 wherein Ar represents a divalent aryl group, with the proviso that Ar in the formula I and Ar do not have the same meaning at the same time.Ar in the formula II may include EMI3.2 EMI4.1 If the copolymer component of the recurring unit represented by the formula II is contained in excess of 20 mole , the laminated product obtained will be lowered in heat resistance.The polycyanoaryl ether may suitably be one having a number average molecular weight calculated on polystyrene within the range of from 20,000 to 90,000 as measured by high temperature gel permeation chromatography at 135 0C in a solution of 70 mg dl in N methylpyrrolidone as the solvent. If the number average molecular weight is less than 20,000, the polymer obtained lacks mechanical strength and heat resistance, while the number average molecular weight over 90,000 will make it difficult to form a composite with the fibrous reinforcing material as hereinafter described Preferably, the number average molecular weight is 25,000 to 70,000.The polycyanoaryl ether may be prepared as follows.For example, dihalogenobenzonitrile and an alkali metal salt of a divalent phenol of either one of EMI4.2 may be dissolved in a solvent such as N methylpyrrolidone, sulforane, etc. to carry out the reaction at a temperature within the range of from 150 to 300 C, preferably from 160 to 250 OC, followed by treatment with water or an alcohol. When a copolymer of polycyanoaryl ether is to be prepared, two or more kinds of divalent phenol may be employed.The amount of the above polycyanoaryl ether formulated in preparation of the laminated product is generally 20 to 85 by weight. If the formulated amount is less than 20 by weight, the polycyanoaryl ether cannot be sufficiently dispersed among the fibrous reinforcing materials, while an amount over 85 by weight will make heat resistance insufficient.Next, the fibrous reinforcing material which is the other constituent of the laminated product may be any of those conventionally known, as exemplified by glass fibers, carbon fibers, aromatic polyamide fibers, etc. In carrying out lamination, chopped strand mat, continuous long fiber mat, woven fabric or knitted fabric of these fibrous reinforcing materials may be used, or alternatively a combination of these may also be used.The amount of the fibrous reinforcing material formulated may generally be 15 to 80 by weight, preferably 20 to 70 by weight, and the mechanical strength of the laminated product will be lowered if the formulated amount falls outside of this range.Next, as the method for preparation of the laminated product, there may be employed 1 the method in which powder or pellets of a polycyanoaryl ether are sprayed uniformly on a mat or a fabric of the above fibrous reinforcing material and compression molded 2 the method in which a sheet is formed by extrusion molding or compression molding from the pellets of a polycyanoaryl ether, and this sheet of the polycyanoaryl ether and a mat or fabric of the above fibrous reinforcing material are laminated and compression molded 3 the method in which the above methods 1 and 2 are suitably combined, etc. but it is possible to employ any known method if it can laminate the polycyanoaryl ether and the fibrous reinforcing material.In either case of 1 and 2 , known additives such as antioxidants, thermal stabilizers, crystal nucleation agents, UV ray absorbers, fillers, etc. may be added to the polycyanoaryl ether without any inconvenience.Also, in the above methods 1 and 2 , during preparation of sheets, pellets or powder of polycyanoaryl ether, it is convenient for improvement of heat resistance and mechanical strength to incorporate short fibers such as of carbon fibers, glass fibers and aromatic polyamide fibers, glass beads, mica, potassium titanate, talc, asbestos, etc. in an amount of 30 by weight or less. The laminated product of this invention produced according to the method as described above may have a structure or thickness, which may be determined depending on uses and not particularly limited. For example, there may be included a laminated product having a three layer structure in which said polycyanoaryl ether is laminated on the surface and the back of the inner layer comprising said fibrous reinforcing material, a laminated product of a multi layer structure in which the layers of polycyanoaryl ether and the layers of fibrous reinforcing material are alternately laminated in a large number, or a two layer laminated product as its minimum unit.This invention is described in more detail by referring to the following Examples.
