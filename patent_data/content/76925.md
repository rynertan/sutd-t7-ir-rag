# Laser assisted machining of glass materials.

## Abstract
A system for machining a glass workpiece 16 com prises means 10, 18 for rotating the workpiece 16 . A concentrated beam of energy 12 is axially directed to the surface of the workpiece 16 to soften the glass material. The softened glass material is then removed by a pointed or relatively narrow tool 32 which is precisely located with respect to the area treated by the energy beam 22 .
