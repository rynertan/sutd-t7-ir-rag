# Analysis system.

## Abstract
An analysis system has a first storage area 28 in which sample and reagent materials are stored at an appro priate storage temperature and a second analysis area 26 which is maintained at a controlled and stabilized high er temperature at which the analysis is to be performed. A plurality of analysis cuvettes of long thermal time constant material are stored adjacent the second storage area 26 for time intervals sufficient for those analysis cuvettes to be equilibrated to the analysis temperature. A transport mech anism 70 in the second storage area 26 is adapted to transport the equilibrated analytical cuvettes sequentially from the supply station 62 to a load station 64 , then to an analysis station 66 and then to a used cuvette station, and a transfer mechanism 120 is arranged for movement be tween the first and second storage areas 26 28 for trans ferring quantities of sample and reagent from the first storage area 28 for loading into the equilibrated analytical cuvette at the loading station 64 in the second storage area 26 .
