# Process for preparing graft polymer of PVC.

## Abstract
Process for the preparation of a graft copolymer comprising a PVC backbone and graft branches formed from cationically polymerizable monomers such as styrene, isoprene, butadiene and in particular, isobutylene. The process includes the steps of irradiating the PVC resin to form reactive sites thereon, dissolving the irradiated resin in a suitable solvent, adding a monomeric charge of isobutylene and a catalytic amount of an alkylaluminum compound to polymerize a plurality of polyisobutylene branches from the reactive sites, subsequently terminating the reaction and separating the graft copolymer.
