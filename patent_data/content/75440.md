# Reagent mixing system and method.

## Abstract
A mixing system and method for analysing a specimen is provided which includes introducing a predetermined number of discrete jets of liquid reagent into a container 16 carrying a specimen. The jets of reagent cause turbulent mixing of the reagent and specimen. The jets are time spaced to allow set tling of the mixture between jets to prevent the escape of the mixture from the container. After the reagent and specimen are thoroughly mixed, a characteristic of the mixture is then detected.
