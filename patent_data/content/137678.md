# Ultrasonic enhanced immuno reactions.

## Abstract
Rates of binding between members of a specific binding pair, e.g., ligand receptor, are greatly enhanced by short term ultrasonication of an aqueous medium containing the specific binding pair. The enhanced rates find particular use in specific binding protein assays.
