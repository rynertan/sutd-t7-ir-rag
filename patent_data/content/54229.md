# Method of cutting out shell valves formed in a wafer sheet.

## Abstract
The shell valves 12 are separed from the web portion 14 of the wafer sheet by means of a sawing operation, effected parallel to the plane of the sheet. When two valves cut out in such way are assembled to form a shell enclosing a filling, the sawn areas 32 mate each other so that they result hidden to the sight. Application to the manufacture of sweet products and of confectionery.
