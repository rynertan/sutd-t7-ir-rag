## Abstract
A unit U enabling computer operation of and data acquisition from a system requiring a fluid input and supplying data in electrical form at an output. The unit comprises a valve 6 for supply of fluid between one and a plurality of selectable ports. A valve actuator 7 brings said one port and a selected port into communication in response to a signal derived from a micro computer 1 . An A D converter 3 relays data derived from said system to said micro computer 1 in digital form. The unit is preferably adapted for communication with an external computer C to permit programming of the micro computer 1 and data acquisition by this computer C .
