# Electrical cartridge fuselinks and method of manufacturing such fuselinks.

## Abstract
A fuse element 15 for an electrical cartridge fuse comprises a fusible wire secured to opposite end zones of an insulating strip by metallic layers 4 sprayed on to the end zones. The insulating strip has a slot therein between the end zones to prevent the fusible, central section of the wire from contacting the strip. The fuse element is disposed in an insulating barrel 16 and the layers 4 are soldered to end caps 17 of the barrel to connect the fusible wire thereto. Fuse elements of this construction are produced by dispos ing a fusible wire along a continuous strip of insulating material formed at equally spaced intervals with slots and spraying the metallic layers onto the strip between the slots so as to adhere the fusible wire to the strip. Thereafter, the strip is severed at the zones between the slots so as to pro duce individual fuse elements. This method of manufacture facilitates the production of cartridge fuses utilizing small diameter fusible wires.
