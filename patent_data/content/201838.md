# DRIVING CIRCUIT FOR LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY

## Abstract
A liquid crystal display has generally plural liquid crystal cells which are constituted as matrix, and each cells have respectively one transistor and supplied image signals by such transistors. A driving circuit for liquid crystal display of the present invention periodically transverses the polarity of voltage of the image signals and voltage between both terminal of the liquid crystal cell, and so as to switching the transistor, the driving circuit generates gate signals impress ed on gate electrode of the transistor, having lowest voltage lower than a voltage subtracted the voltage of amplitude of common electrode from the lowest voltage in the image signals.
