# Method and apparatus for withdrawing a tube or pile which has been driven into the soil.

## Abstract
Method and device for withdrawing a pile or the like which has been driven into the soil by means of a ram device which can performs blows downwardly and upwardly and which in upward direction has a connection with the pile with a free stroke which free stroke for efficient withdrawal is removed.

## Claims
1. Method for withdrawing a tube or pile by means of a ram device placed upon the pile and having a housing and a blow mass movably upwardly and downwardly in said housing, which mass can blow downwardly upon the pile as well as upwardly against the housing, which housing can be connected with the tube or pile by means of a connection having a free stroke, characterized in thatfor the withdrawal of the tube or pile the free stroke is removed.

## Description
The invention relates to a method for withdrawing a tube or pile by means of a ram device placed upon the pile and having a housing and a blow mass movable upwardly and downwardly in said housing, which mass can blow downwardly upon the pile as well as upwardly against the housing, which housing can be connected with the tube or pile by means of a connection having a free stroke. This method is applied in case tubes or piles or other profiles are driven into the soil, which lateron have to be withdrawn. This e.g. happens if one wants to manufacture a concrete pile into the soil according to the system in which primarily a tube is driven into the soil and thereafter concrete is supplied through the tube with simultaneous withdrawal of the tube. Another example in which withdrawal takes place consists in the removal of e.g. pile planking. Said withdrawal may take place with the same device by means of which the driving took place in case the ram device allows that the ram, instead of moving downwardly with high speed, now can be moved upwardly with sufficient speed and then hits the housing, which subsequently performs a blowing tension force on the pile through a connection with the head of the pile. Said tension force serves to assist a tension force which usually is performed with the aid of a hoisting device, which hoisting device, however, directly engages the head of the pile. During driving in it should be possible that the pile, immediately after the performance of a blow, shoots downwardly from below the housing of the ram device. With a ram device which should be able to ram as well as withdraw it then is necessary that the connection between the housing of the ram device and the upper end of the pile has a free stroke which allows said shooting away or blowing down of the pile from below the housing without part of the blow energy getting lost by the fact that the housing again has to be accelerated. However, if one wants to withdraw with such a ram device then with each upward blow first the free stroke has to be passed before blow force can be exerted upon the upper end of the pile in upward direction. This does cost a lot of energy. Purpose of the invention is to provide a simple solution for this and this purpose is obtained in that prior to the withdrawal the free stroke is removed. In this way loss of energy during withdrawal is avoided. With a ram device comprising a housing with a ram movable upwardly and downwardly in said housing, means for moving said ram and means at the housing of the ram as well as means at the outer side of the tube or pile which with the before mentioned means form a connection with a free stroke, the aim according to the invention can be achieved in a simple way in that the housing of the ram device has been provided with a plurality of downwardly shiftable pressure members which are regularly distributed around the axis of the housing and may engage the pile head or cap. The extendable pressure members remove the clearance. This shifting outwardly can be performed mechanically in any suitable way. Thus according to the invention it is possible that the pressure members are formed by plungers of hydraulic cylinders. Said hydraulic cylinders may have a separate pressure supply. If a hydraulic ram device is used according to the invention it makes sense to shift the plungers outwardly by means of the hydraulic pressure members by pressurizing said members when the hydraulic system for controlling the movements of the ram is switched over to withdrawing. The invention now will be further elucidated with reference to the drawings. The figures show a housing 1 of the ram device with inside a ram 2 which has an extension 3 which can perform blow energy upon the blow plate 4 which is present on top of a tubular pile 5. The ram 2, 3 is moved upwardly and eventually also downwardly by means of preferably hydraulic means not shown. The housing has an extension 6 extending downwardly along the pile 5 which extension has been provided with cams 7. The tubular pile 5 has been provided with cams 8. Links 9 are placed over the cams 7 and 8. Figure 1 shows that the links 9 have a clearance The housing has an annular portion 10 provided with a ring of cylinders 11 with plungers 12. If pressure is supplied to said cylinders the plungers 12 will be pressed downwardly into the position shown in figure 2 in which case the clearance For the withdrawal the ram 2 is allowed to perform blow energy against the upper part 13 of the housing 1 through the abutment 14. At the same time one may draw with the aid of a hoising device directly at the cams 8 or by means of the links 9 in a direction indicated with the arrows F.
