## Description
This application relates to methods for manufacturing proteins in bacteria. It particularly is concerned with isolating eukaryotic proteins from the periplasm of transformed bacteria while minimizing proteolytic degradation of the protein and contamination by nonperiplasmic proteins. This application also relates to the synthesis of mature eukaryotic proteins in bacterial hosts. It is directed to providing vectors that will express hybrid preproteins in high yields in host cells, cleave the signal sequence from the preprotein and secrete mature eukaryotic protein in the periplasmic space of the host cells. Literature that should be consulted in regard to this application is U.S. patent 4,375,514 and 4,411,994 U.K. patent application 2,091,268A published 1982 I. Palva Many naturally occurring secretory and membrane proteins are initially synthesized as nascent or intracellular preproteins. These are proteins in which a signal polypeptide is linked to the amino acid residue that will become the amino terminus of the mature protein upon secretion. The signal polypeptide is a peptide sequence which enables the mature protein to pass through the cellular membrane of the cell. The signal peptide is cleaved away, or processed , in passing through the cellular membrane by a mechanism that is under study. If the processing occurs properly the mature protein will be free of any amino terminal extraneous signal amino acid residues and will have the proper amino terminal amino acid. Thus, if a heterologous gene which includes the DNA encoding a signal sequence is expressed by a host gram negative bacterial cell and the signal is then cleaved properly by the host, the mature protein without an appended methionine moiety is secreted into the periplasmic space of the host, i.e., the space between the inner, or cytoplasmic, membrane and the outer membrane of the host. Also known are host vector systems in which the signal protein and at least an amino terminal portion of the mature protein ordinarily associated with the signal is expressed and processed while linked to a heterologous protein, thereby resulting in the secretion of a fusion protein. Secretion of mature eukaryotic protein into the periplasm of gram negative bacteria such as Heretofore the vector constructions employed for periplasmic secretion in gram negative bacteria have, to applicants knowledge, all entailed the use either of complete eukaryotic signals or of partial hybrids. Constructions which encode two typical partial hybrids are schematically shown below, with the secretion cleavage sites generally encountered being designated with an arrow. Constructions like the partial bacterial preprotein mature eukaryotic protein fusions shown in schematic A result in the secretion of fusions of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins. It is inconvenient and sometimes impossible to remove the extraneous amino terminal amino acids encoded by the prokaryotic DNA. On the other hand, constructions like those of schematic B, result in the secretion of mature protein but yields of secreted mature eukaryotic protein are less than desired. It would be useful to construct hybrid vectors as described below which could be expressed as direct hybrids of the prokaryotic signal and mature eukaryotic protein, processed by hosts and secreted into the periplasm. Such a vector is shown below. J. Kadonaga The reasons for the relative difficulty previously encountered in obtaining the secretion of the product of direct hybrids are unknown. However, applicants speculate that while secretion and processing machinery are conserved in bacteria so that eukaryotic preproteins have been processed in several cases , or the machinery is somewhat flexible as shown in processing of schematic A type fusions , a particularly difficult obstacle to secretion would appear to be posed by constructions in which such bacteria must process the expressed product at a completely artificial cleavage site, i.e., a site which is neither a prokaryotic nor eukaryotic site for about from 1 to 3 residues on either side of the point at which hydrolysis occurs. Contrary to this expectation, and the prior failures and skepticism of those skilled in the art, applicants have found that periplasmic bacteria indeed can process direct fusions of prokaryotic signals with mature eukaryotic proteins, and can do so with secreted mature protein yields higher than those obtained by applicants with eukaryotic preproteins. Particularly satisfactory results have been obtained in secreting mammalian growth hormones. Mammalian growth hormone is a normal product of the pituitary gland. Mammalian growth hormones are now known to exhibit a degree of species cross specificity, a function of similar amino acid sequence and conformation. Human growth hormone hGH consists of 191 amino acids and has a molecular weight of about 21,500. HGH is in clinical use for the treatment of hypopituitary dwarfism. It also has been proposed to be effective in the treatment of burns, wound healing, dystrophy, bone knitting, diffuse gastric bleeding and pseudoarthrosis. Recently, hGH has been synthesized in recombinant host cells. See, for example, U.S. 4,342,832. HGH is not significantly degraded by bacterial cells and can be produced directly if the gene for its direct expression, including the appropriately placed start codon, is linked to a suitable promoter. Because prokaryotes frequently do not remove the amino terminal methionine from the resulting protein, expression of heterologous hGH DNA under control of a bacterial promoter as shown in U.S. Patent 4,342,832 yields hGH having methionine as its first amino acid. The reason for this is that the DNA ATG codon start codon is ultimately expressed as methionine. Results to date, for example, with production of hGH in E.P.O. Publication Number 127305 provides for the synthesis and secretion of mature hGH in prokaryotic hosts by transforming such hosts with prehGH, i.e., with hGH having its normal eukaryotic signal sequence. Host cells were able to express prehGH, to recognize the eukaryotic signal and to process the preprotein properly. Mature hGH was then recovered from the periplasm, but yields were not as high as desired. DNA sequences encoding a prokaryotic secreting signal sequence operably linked to the 5 end of DNA coding for eukaryotic proteins or for mature hGH are also described in the EP A 55 942 and WO A 84 03519 One currently used technique for recovery of periplasmic protein is called spheroplasting H. Neu Another method is called osmotic shock H. Neu These methods have been practiced on viable cells. The use of viable cells is undesirable because their proteolytic enzymes are fully active. When applicants attempted to recover secreted hGH from a viable culture of Accordingly, it is desirable to provide improved methods to recover periplasmic proteins. Such improved methods would minimize proteolytic degradation by proteases during recovery, and in general would be sufficiently delicate to minimize contamination of periplasmic protein by intracellular proteins. They also would permit the recovery of large proportions of periplasmic protein by manipulative steps more amenable to commercial, large scale use than currently available procedures, and would not entail the use of contaminating proteinaceous reagents. It is also desirable to express and secrete high periplasmic amounts of mature eukaryotic protein in bacterial hosts. It is further desirable to obtain periplasmic mature human growth hormone in elevated amounts. In a first aspect the invention provides a hybrid DNA sequence encoding a protein having at least the amino terminal sequence of mature hGH operably linked to a DNA sequence encoding an enterotoxin signal. DNA encoding The STII Shine Dalgarno S.D. sequence is a particularly powerful ribosome binding site which contributes to yield improvement. It ordinarily is linked to prokaryotic promoters such as the tryptophan trp or bacterial alkaline phosphatase AP promoters, and could be employed with any promoter system. In a second aspect the invention provides a replicable vector containing, in 5 to 3 order, a promoter, a Shine Dalgarno sequence, a hybrid DNA sequence as defined above and a termination region comprising a stop codon said promoter controlling transcription of the hybrid DNA sequence. In a third aspect the invention provides a method comprising In a fourth aspect the invention provides a prokaryotic cell culture comprising In a fifth aspect the invention provides a prokaryotic cell culture comprising New prokaryotic cell cultures are produced upon transformation and culture of host cells using the above method. These cultures comprise a mature eukaryotic protein and b a direct hybrid fusion protein of the mature eukaryotic protein with a prokaryotic secretion signal sequence. Ordinarily, greater than about 25 percent, generally up to about 90 percent, of the total weight of mature and fusion protein is mature protein located in the periplasm of the cell. The preferred method comprises obtaining viable or killed cells which have been transformed to secrete a heterologous or eukaryotic protein, causing the outer membrane of the cells to become permeable for passage of the protein out through the membrane as for example by freezing and thawing, and separating the periplasmic proteins, including secreted eukaryotic protein, from the remainder of the cells. It also is advantageous to culture the cell under phosphate limiting conditions to engender changes in the cell membranes which enhance recovery of the periplasmic protein. A novel killing method is provided wherein transformed cells are contacted with an alkanol and heated. These cells then are treated by a cold shock method comprising freezing and thawing which enables recovery of periplasmic proteins. These methods are employed to particular advantage in recovering hGH from gram negative organisms which express and process a direct hybrid fusion of the Fig. 1 discloses the STII gene, including its translated and untranslated regions. The principal portion of its S.D. sequence is overlined at nucleotides 155 161. The imputed amino acid sequence for the STII signal is located at residues 23 to 1 and for the mature STII enterotoxin at residues 1 48. Fig. 1 also discloses the processing site for STII designated cleavage site and various restriction enzyme sites. The asterisk designates the likely mRNA synthesis initiation site assuming that the STII promoter includes the overlined structures at position 84 89 and 108 114. Figs. 2a 2d disclose the construction of a vector ptrp STII hGH encoding a secretable STII hGH fusion protein under the control of the trp promoter and containing an STII S.D. sequence. Fig. 3 is a detail of the plasmid tr STII hGH. Fig. 3a is the nucleotide sequence of the trp promoter region, STII signal and the hGH gene in ptrp STII hGH. Figs. 4a 4c disclose the construction of the vectors pAP 1 and pAP STII hGH encoding secretable AP hGH and STII hGH fusion proteins under the control of the AP promoter, the vector encoding the latter containing an STII S.D. sequence. Fig. 5 is the nucleotide sequence of the AP promoter region, STII signal and the hGH gene in pAP STII hGH. Fig. 6 is the nucleotide sequence of the AP promoter region, the AP signal and the hGH gene in pAP 1. A heterologous protein is a protein not ordinarily secreted by the bacterial cell. While such a protein may be an ordinarily intracellular protein of the transformed cell that has been engineered for secretion, or it may be a protein encoded by DNA from another microbe, ordinarily it is a eukaryotic protein, a fragment thereof or a fusion thereof with a prokaryotic protein or fragment. Preferably the periplasmic protein is a mature eukaryotic protein such as a hormone, e.g., hGH, an interferon or a lymphokine. The cells to be treated herein may be obtained from cultures of transformed bacteria grown in conventional media or media tailored to the vectors or mutant host transformants used to secrete the heterologous protein. Applicants have demonstrated the secretion of direct hybrid fusions of a prokaryotic signal and desired eukaryotic protein, notwithstanding the complexity of the host vector systems at both the level of preprotein synthesis and secretion. Plasmids were constructed in which the trp or AP promoters were employed with various directly linked prokaryotic signal and eukaryotic protein sequences. Suitable hosts were transformed with each of these plasmids and the amount and distribution of product between the periplasm and cytoplasm determined. These experiments demonstrated that mature eukaryotic proteins are secreted and correctly processed into the periplasmic space of organisms from direct hybrid fusion proteins. The following table shows the results of successful experiments. The results obtained by using the normal hGH eukaryotic signal are shown for comparison. Applicants initial attempts to secrete some mature eukaryotic proteins using prokaryotic signals in the above structural format did not result in synthesis of protein in some cases, and in others expression was not accompanied by secretion. Cultures transformed with vectors for the murine immunoglobulin heavy chain using the STII signal , human tissue plasminogen activator using the AP promoter and signal or a bovine prorennin using the trp promoter and the STII signal in It is clear from this work that direct hybrid fusions of prokaryotic signals with mature eukaryotic proteins are recognized by bacterial cells, i.e., processed and transported into the periplasm. Given that knowledge, the skilled artisan must nonetheless exert diligence in identifying functional constructions. This effort should be directed first at screening vectors encoding direct hybrid fusions with signals obtained from a variety of periplasmic bacterial proteins, e.g. enzymes or enterotoxins. If the secretion of mature eukaryotic protein is not obtained upon the transformation and culture of The method herein is facilitated by the ability of gram negative bacteria to recognize direct fusions with the STII enterotoxin signal peptide. Furthermore, it is based on the additional discovery that elevated yields are obtained by use of the STII S.D. sequence. Partial amino acid sequences for hGH and STII enterotoxin preproteins are shown below with the starting amino acid for each mature protein being underlined. The prokaryotic signal sequence to be used herein is the signal sequence from any bacterial secreted or cell membrane enterotoxin, or mutation thereof. The preferred embodiments are found among the heat stable ST and heat labile LT enterotoxins of According to Picken et al., The prokaryotic signal may be mutated in order to increase the proportion of eukaryotic protein that is secreted. Generally, mutations in codons encoding amino acid positions outside of the hydrophobic core of the signal, e.g., residues 1, 2 or 3, are more likely to exert a significant effect on signal cleavage. The mutated DNA will express an amino acid at the site of mutation which is different from the wild type signal. Most conveniently a plurality of codons are substituted at a given position, each of which encodes a different amino acid. This is accomplished by methods known in the art. For example see S. Michaelis, Mutagenic optimization is particularly desirable upon switching from one host to another while using vectors containing substantially the same signal. The reason for this is that allelic variants in the bacterial enzyme system responsible for cleaving the signal eukaryotic protein fusion and transporting the mature protein may more readily recognize a suitably modified prokaryotic signal. In accordance with this invention any eukaryotic protein, mutant or derivative may be secreted if proper gram negative hosts and signals are selected, provided of course that the protein Vectors for transforming hosts to express direct hybrid fusion proteins are made in conventional fashion by methods generally known to those skilled in the art. In such vectors, DNA encoding the prokaryotic signal is directly linked to DNA encoding the desired protein. This means that the signal DNA encoding the amino acid immediately upstream from the normal bacterial cleavage site is linked directly to the DNA encoding the first amino acid of the desired mature eukaryotic protein, without any intervening residual sequences from the mature prokaryotic protein or the normal eukaryotic pre sequence. Such direct linkage is accomplished by known methods such as the M13 deletional mutagensis precedure described in the examples. Alternately, one may chemically synthesize DNA encoding the signal and cleavage region. This DNA is blunt end ligated, or ligated through a convenient restriction enzyme site, to DNA encoding the remainder of the eukaryotic protein. DNA encoding STII signal is directly linked in either fashion to DNA encoding the desired mature eukaryotic protein. When the eukaryotic protein is a growth hormone, the signal will be linked to DNA having as its two first 5 codons, codons which encode at least the first two amino terminal amino acids of hGH, i.e., NH₂ phe pro, and preferably encode the first 15 amino terminal amino acids of hGH. This sequence ordinarily is part of a DNA sequence encoding growth hormone such as hGH, bovine growth hormone having the amino terminal sequence phe pro ala met ser leu or porcine growth hormone having the amino terminal sequence phe pro ala met pro leu and the allelic variants thereof. Suitable vectors for use herein are constructed by operably ligating the direct hybrid fusion DNA to replication and translation effecting sequences. Sequences which effect translation of the mRNA include an S.D. sequence present upstream from the prokaryotic signal. Preferably, the S.D. sequence used herein is that of STII, and it is spaced from the prokaryotic signal start codon by the natural intervening sequence TTTT found in the STII gene. This construction is obtained most easily by isolating the STII signal complete with its S.D. sequence and normal intervening sequence from a source of the STII gene as is further described below. However, because this portion of the STII gene is only 80 bp long it also is practical to simply synthesize the required sequence by known chemical methods. This is especially preferred if extensive mutagenesis of the signal is contemplated. The construction shown in Fig. 3a contains two S.D. sequences, one upstream S.D. sequence donated by the trp promoter and then the STII S.D. sequence in its normal relationship with the STII signal DNA. We believe that the upstream, non STII S.D. sequence is not required. Other prokaryotic signal sequences also may be synthesized by chemical methods as they tend to be less than 100 bp in length. Transcription of the foregoing S.D. signal protein sequence is under the control of a promoter. The promoter is preferably a prokaryotic promoter other than the promoter ordinarily associated with the selected prokaryotic signal. The preferred embodiment is the AP promoter, although others such as the tac, trp or lactose D. Goeddel The promoter S.D. signal sequences are present in vectors containing replicon sequences compatible with the host cells. The vectors are generally plasmids rather than phage. They contain a replication site as well as phenotypic marking sequences to facilitate identification of transformed cells. For example, When a DNA sequence is operably ligated or linked to another it means that the DNA sequence in question exerts an influence on other DNA sequences. This generally means that the first DNA controls either the transcription or ultimately the translation of the DNA to which it is operably ligated, or affects the processing of the translated protein. For example, a promoter is operably ligated to DNA encoding a preprotein when it affects the rate of translation of the preprotein mRNA. A signal polypeptide is operably ligated to DNA encoding a desired protein when it is placed in reading frame with and ligated directly to the DNA encoding the protein. The term ligated in reference to a composition should not be inferred to mean that the composition is only defined in terms of its possible manufacture by ligation. On the contrary, operably lighted elements in a plasmid can be synthesized chemically as a unitary entity. The host cells that are transformed with the foregoing vectors are bacteria a having a periplasmic space between two cell membranes, b in which the vector replicates and c in which the preprotein is both expressed and processed. The hosts are generally gram negative organisms, particularly The host cells may, but need not constitutively express the host protein normally promoted by the promoter used to control transcription of DNA for the direct hybrid fusion. For example, either an While any culture medium ordinarily used for the host cells is satisfactory for the transformants, the composition of host culture medium exerts a strong effect on the secretion of eukaryotic protein by wild type hosts rather than strain W3110 phoA, phoT or phoA, phoR . Media containing yeast extract results in improved secretion when compared to tryptone a tryptic digest of casein or a synthetic mixture of 19 amino acids. It appears that one or more components of yeast extract helps to activate secretion. In the preferred embodiment the cells are to be grown under phosphate limiting conditions prior to harvest of the culture. This is the case whether or not the organism is transformed with a vector encoding a eukaryotic protein under the control of a promoter for a phosphate processing protein, or whether the cell is defective in transporting or catabolizing phosphate nutrients. Surprisingly, the use of a phosphate limiting culture medium prior to cell harvest during the late stages of fermentation greatly improves the mechanical characteristics of transformed gram negative organisms. These characteristics enhance the efficacy of the cold shock extraction method described Preferably the cells are permitted to accumulate periplasmic heterologous protein to a maximum level, usually during a growth stage following logarithmic growth, prior to initiation of the treatment provided herein. The cells should be killed as soon as this point is reached or shortly thereafter. The term killed means that the cells at least are unable to replicate. It is likely, however, that treatment with alkanol and heat as is further described Cells that have reached the desired point of growth are preferably killed by immediately contacting them with an alkanol and heating. The alkanol should not be an alkanol which is lytic for cell membrines, e.g. 1 octanol. Generally, suitable alkanols include lower C₂ to C₄ monohydroxy alkanols such as 1 butanol or ethanol, preferably 1 butanol. The alcohol should be contacted with the cells by adding the alkanol to the fermentation culture while continuously mixing. The amount of alcohol which is added will be such as to bring the culture to an alkanol concentration of about from 0.5 percent to 10 percent vol vol, and preferably about to 1.5 percent vol vol for 1 butanol. Butanol is preferred because as little as about 0.5 percent can be used larger proportions are needed for equivalent inactivation when using a propanol or ethanol. Contemporaneous with or after the addition of alkanol to the cell culture, the temperature of the culture is increased to and held at a level sufficient in conjunction with alkanol to kill the cells. Ordinarily this will be about from 0.5 to 20 minutes at a temperature of about from 55 C to 35 C, the higher temperatures being employed for the lesser periods. The alkanol enables the heating to be conducted at a lower temperature than would otherwise be required, an advantage in preserving the activity of proteins to be recovered. Cell killing is not critical. Since it is useful in preventing or retarding product degradation it may be dispensed with if the cells can be processed quickly and regulatory requirements for handling recombinant cells can be otherwise complied with. However, we have found that killing the cells approximately doubles the product protein recovery without reducing the purity of the product protein in the recovered supernatants. After the cells are cultured and or killed, periplasmic protein is recovered. This generally entails forming a paste of the cells, freezing the cells, thawing the cells, suspending them in buffer, and separating the periplasmic proteins from cell debris, e.g. by low speed centrifugation or filtration. The periplasmic proteins, including secreted eukaryotic proteins, are located in the supernatant. Eukaryotic periplasmic proteins may be obtained in higher specific activity, i.e. purity, than is attained with osmotic shock methods, and treatment with a hypertonic agent such as 20 percent sucrose is not required, but it should be understood that any method for causing the outer membrane of the cell to become permeable to the periplasmic protein can be used with killed cells. The cell paste to be frozen is produced by centrifuging or filtering the cell culture and recovering the cell mass. This paste typically contains residual quantities of the fermented culture medium, e.g. LB Luria Broth medium it is unnecessary to wash the cells with a freezing menstruum prior to the subsequent steps. It is not critical that a cell paste be formed as the cold shock extraction method herein is largely independent of cell density. However, the economics of freezing and thawing large volumes of material are such that small paste volumes are preferred. The cell freezing should be as soon as possible. Generally the paste at room temperature is placed in a freezer at 20 C until frozen, and then stored at 80 C until further processing is required. The frozen paste is thawed and diluted into several volumes of water or aqueous buffer, preferably about 3 or greater volumes of 10 mM tris HCl buffer at pH8. This buffer is hypotonic to the intracellular contents of the host organisms. The following steps are performed at about 4 C. The dilutions generally should be about 3 volumes of buffer, although the identity, concentration, and pH of buffer will vary depending upon the periplasmic protein to be recovered. The cells are thoroughly suspended in the buffer. This step is facilitated by suspending the cells in the buffer by use of a homogenizer set at a speed at which no substantial lysis of the cells occurs. The suspended cells are gently stirred for about from 10 to 60 minutes, ordinarily about 30 minutes. Then the cell debris and cells containing cytoplasmic proteins are removed by centrifugation, typically 12,000 x g for 30 minutes, or by filtration. The supernatant contains the periplasmic proteins, solubilized outer membrane proteins, residual culture medium and extracellular proteins, and a small proportion of soluble intracellular proteins. The desired eukaryotic protein may be purified from the supernatant in accord with further procedures as desired. The freeze thaw extraction method described above offers considerable advantages in terms of yield and, surprisingly, purity of the desired periplasmic protein when compared to extraction of either fresh killed or unkilled transformants with buffer alone. Approximately 5 to 26 times as much hGH is recovered from frozen unkilled cells than from unfrozen, unkilled buffer extracted cells. The supernatants from frozen killed cells were about 19 percent hGH by weight of total protein, but from fresh killed cells only about 16 percent hGH. The foregoing method is applied in the following Examples to the recovery of hGH from In order to simplify the Examples certain frequently occurring and well known methods employed in recombinant constructions will be referenced by shorthand phrases or designations. Plasmids are designated by a lower case p preceded and or followed by capital letters and or numbers. The starting plasmids or sources of DNA herein are commercially available, are publically available on an unrestricted basis, or can be constructed from available plasmids or polynucleotides in accord with published procedures. In addition, other equivalent plasmids are known in the art and will be apparent to the ordinary artisan since the plasmids generally only function as replication vehicles for the preprotein and its control sequences, or for elements thereof in intermediate constructions. Digestion of DNA refers to catalytic cleavage of the DNA with an enzyme that acts only at certain locations in the DNA. Such enzymes are called restriction enzymes, and the sites for which each is specific is called a restriction site. Partial digestion refers to incomplete digestion by a restriction enzyme, i.e., conditions are chosen that result in cleavage of some but not all of the sites for a given restriction endonuclease in a DNA substrate. The various restriction enzymes used herein are commercially available and their reaction conditions, cofactors and other requirements as established by the enzyme suppliers were used. Restriction enzymes commonly are designated by abbreviations composed of a capital letter followed by other letters and then, generally, a number representing the microorganism from which each restriction enzyme originally was obtained. In general, about 1 µg of plasmid or DNA fragment is used with about 1 unit of enzyme in about 20 µl of buffer solution. Appropriate buffers and substrate amounts for particular restriction enzymes are specified by the manufacturer. Incubation times of about 1 hour at 37 C are ordinarily used, but may vary in accordance with the supplier s instructions. After incubation, protein is removed by extraction with phenol and chloroform, and the digested nucleic acid is recovered from the aqueous fraction by precipitation with ethanol. Digestion with a restriction enzyme infrequently is followed with bacterial alkaline phosphatase hydrolysis of the terminal 5 phosphates to prevent the two restriction cleaved ends of a DNA fragment from circularizing or forming a closed loop upon ligation described below that would impede insertion of another DNA fragment at the restriction site. Unless otherwise stated, digestion of plasmids is not followed by 5 terminal dephosphorylation. Procedures and reagents for dephosphorylation are conventional T. Maniatis Recovery or isolation of a given fragment of DNA from a restriction digest means separation of the digest on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, identification of the fragment of interest by comparison of its mobility versus that of marker DNA fragments of known molecular weight, removal of the gel section containing the desired fragment, and separation of the DNA from the gel, generally by electroelution. This procedure is known generally. For example, see A. Lawn Southern Analysis is a method by which the presence of DNA sequences in a digest or DNA containing composition is confirmed by hybridization to a known, labelled oligonucleotide or DNA fragment. For the purposes herein, unless otherwise provided, Southern analysis shall mean separation of digests on 1 percent agarose, denaturation and transfer to nitrocellulose by the method of E. Southern, 1975, J. Mol. Biol. Transformation means introducing DNA into an organism so that the DNA is replicable, either as an extrachromosomal element or chromosomal integrant. Unless otherwise provided, the method used herein for transformation of Ligation refers to the process of forming phosphodiester bonds between two double stranded nucleic acid fragments T. Maniatis Preparation of DNA from transformants means isolating plasmid DNA from microbial culture. Unless otherwise provided, the alkaline SDS method of Maniatis Oligonucleotides are short length single or double stranded polydeoxynucleotides which are chemically synthesized by known methods and then purified on polyacrylamide gels. All literature citations are expressly incorporated by reference. The following construction is illustrated in Fig. 2a. The plasmid pWM501 Picken EcoRI PstI fragment This construction method is shown in Fig. 2b. pSTII partial from Example 1 was digested with MnlI and BamHI and a 180 bp fragment Refer to Figs. 2c 2d for a schematic display of this method. STII leader The gene from ptrpSTII HGH fusion HGH was synthesized in shake culture using plasmid This construction is shown in Figs. 4a 4c. A DNA fragment containing a portion of the AP gene was isolated from the plasmid pHI 1 In plasmid ptrp STII hGH from Example 3 was digested with Eight hours prior to the start of a 10 liter fermentation a 500 ml inoculum culture is grown up. A transformant of The glucose feed and aeration are turned off but the agitation rate of 650 rpm is maintained. 1 butanol is added immediately to the fermenter to yield a final concentration of 1.5 percent and steam is immediately injected into the fermenter jacket so that the temperature in the tank rises rapidly to 50 C. When the temperature reaches 50 C, it is held at this temperature for 10 minutes. Then the fermenter is rapidly cooled below 20 C and the cellular contents of the fermenter are harvested by centrifugation. The cell paste is first frozen at 20 C and then transferred to a 80 C freezer. The cell paste, frozen at 80 C, is thawed overnight at 4 C and all subsequent steps are performed at 4 C. The paste is mixed in 4 volumes of 10mM Tris HCl,pH 8.0 and suspended in an Ultra Turrex homogenizer for 30 seconds. The suspension is stirred for 30 minutes and then the cells are removed by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 30 minutes. The periplasmic proteins contain in the supernatant mature hGH at between 0.5 and 1 gram liter 100 OD₅₅₀ with about 95 percent of the total hGH as estimated from immunoblots with peroxidase coupled anti hGH in processed form in the periplasm. About 50 60 percent of the total cellular hGH is recovered in the supernatant. The supernatant contains about 20 percent hGH by weight of protein. The host organism for the fermentation was constructed in several steps using standard techniques involving transductions with phage derived from P1 J. Miller,
