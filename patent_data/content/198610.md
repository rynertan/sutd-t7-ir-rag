# PREFABRICATED KNOCK DOWN METAL FRAME WORK TABLE

## Abstract
A plurality of side rails, cross rails, side and corner legs are prefabricated from a square, tubular, 12 gauge steel material. Separable side and corner connecting members formed of sub stantially the same tubular steel material include projecting arms and bridging members that are inserted into the open ends of the side rails, cross rails, side and corner members to assem ble the table. The connections are secured by bolting the struc tural frame members to the connecting members. Tubular rec tangular side tracks are secured to the upper surface of the side rails in certain installations to provide support for wheeled car riages that are adapted to move longitudinally of the table. The side connectors and corner connectors are, in general, fabricat ed identically, then utilized in the assembly by slightly different orientation, hole patterns, and the use of the different bridging members.
