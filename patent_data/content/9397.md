# Submicroscopic particles of anion exchange resin and anion exchange process using them.

## Abstract
Submicroscopic particles of anion exchange resin comprise approximately spherical beads of crosslinked copolymer having diameters of 0.01 to 1.5 micrometers and bear 0.7 to 1.5 anion exchange functional groups per mo nomer unit. The particles may be used in the removal of ionic impurities from liquids and may subse quently be separated from the treated liquids by floccula tion. The particles may be made by emulsion polymeriza tion followed by coagulation of the emulsion polymer beads, separation of the resulting coagulum particles from the emulsion polymerization medium and functionalization of the beads, which in some cases will remain as coagulum particles and in other cases will redisperse during function alization. Also of interest are chloromethylated intermedi ates for the functionalized resin.
