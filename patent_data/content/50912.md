CATALYST AND PROCESS FOR THE HYDROTREATING OF NITROGEN CONTAINING FEEDS Cross Reference to Related Application A co pending and concurrently filed application,United States Serial No. ego,536, discloses the hydrodenitrogenation and hydrocracking of highnitrogen feeds in the presence of a catalyst comprising chromium, molybdenum, and at least one metal of Group VIII, a molecular sieve zeolite having a pore diameter of at least 5 0.5 nm and containing exchangeable cations, and a refractory inorganic oxide, such as an alumina, silica, or silica alumina. Background of the Invention This invention is related to the catalytic treatment in the presence of hydrogen of hydrocarbon streams containing large concentrations of nitrogen compounds to remove nitrogen compounds therefrom and the catalyst useful therein. In United States Patent 4,181,602, Quick, et al., disclose a process for the hydrotreating of a heavy hydrocarbon stream wherein said stream is contacted under suitable conditions and in the presence of hydrogen with a catalyst comprising 1 the metals of molybdenum, chromium, and cobalt, 2 their oxides, 3 their sulfides, or 4 mixtures thereof on a large pore, catalytically active alumina, said molybdenum being present in an amount within the range of about 5 wt to about 15 wt , calculated as MoO3 and based upon the total catalyst weight, said chromium being present in an amount within the range of about 5 wt to about 20 wt calculated as Cr203 and based upon the total catalyst weight, said cobalt being present in an amount within the range of about 0.1 wt to about 5 wt , calculated as CoO and based upon the total catalyst weight, and said catalyst possessing a pore volume within the range of about 0.4 cc gm to about 0.8 cc gm, a surface area within the range of about 150 mê gm to about 300 mê gm, and an average porer diameter within the range of about 100 to about 200 . In United States Patent 4,224,144, Hensley, Jr., et al., disclose the catalytic hydrotreatment of petroleum distillates and similar hydrocarbon materials in the presence of a catalyst comprising a hydrogenation component comprising chromium, molybdenum, and a Group VIII metal deposited upon a porous refractory inorganic oxide support or carrier, such as alumina, silica alumina, silica, magnesia, zirconia, and similar materials. They disclose that such a catalyst and process can be used successfully to remove nitrogen and sulfur from a hydrocarbon stream selected from petroleum distillates, tar sands distillates, and shale oil. In United States Patent 4,218,308, Itoh, et al., disclose a catalyst comprising a silica alumina carrier having a silica content that is less than about 40 wt and at least one noble metal component of Group VIII.The catalyst contains 1 pores having a diameter of smaller than 600 occupying at least 90 of the total pore volume and 2 pores having a diameter of 150 to 600 occupying at least about 40 of the total volume of pores having a diameter of smaller than 600 A.They indicate that such catalyst, which is characterized further in that it has a specific surface area of at least about 200 m2 gm and a bulk density of less than about 0.6 gm ml, is capable of effectively removing aromatic compounds contained in a hydrocarbon oil and is useful in the production of jet fuels, kerosene, and white oils. Now there has been found a catalyst which comprises a hydrogenation component comprising chromium, molybdenum, and at least one metal of Group VI I I and a porous alumina silica support, which support contains silica in an amount within the range of about 10 wt to about 50 wt , based upon the weight of the catalyst support. Summary of the Invention There is provided a catalytic composition and a process for the hydrodenitrogenation of a hydrocarbon stream containing a substantial amount of nitrogen compounds, such as a whole shale oil, which process employs the aforesaid catalytic composition. The catalyst comprises a hydrogenation component deposited upon aporous alumina silica support, said hydrogenation component comprising chromium, molybdenum, and at least one metal from Group VIII of thePeriodic Table of Elements, the silica of said support being present in an amount within the range of about 10 wt to about 50 wt , based upon the weight of said support. Typically, the catalyst will have a surface area within the range of about 150 m2 gm to about 350 gum, a pore volume within the range of about 0.4 cc gm to about 1.0 cc gm, and an average pore diameter within the range of about 60 6 nm to about 150 15 nm . The process comprises contacting the hydrocarbon stream, e.g., a whole shale oilj under hydrodenitrogenation conditions and in the presence of hydrogen with the aforesaid catalyst. Brief Description of the Drawing The accompanying figure presents the effect of the composition of the catalyst support on the product quality, when hydrotreating shale oil. Detailed Description of the Invention The present invention is directed to a novel process for the hydrodenitrogenation of a hydrocarbon stream containing a substantial amount of nitrogen compounds and to the catalyst employed in such process. The catalyst and the process of the present invention can be used conveniently to treat a hydrocarbon stream containing a substantial amount of nitrogen compounds. The phrase containing a substantial amount of nitrogen compounds refers to an amount that will result in at least 0.2 wt nitrogen in the particular stream. Such hydrocarbon streams are selected from the group consisting of heavy petroleum hydrocarbon streams, hydrocarbon streams derived from coal, hydrocarbon streams derived from tar sands, and hydrocarbon streams deprived from oil shale. Typical examples of heavy petroleum hydrocarbon streams are virgin gas oils, vacuum gas oils, or coker gas oils. Hydrocarbon streams derived from oil shale can be a whole shale oil or any fraction thereof.Such feedstocks often contain from about 0.2 wt nitrogen to about 3.0 wt nitrogen, or more. Such hydrocarbon feeds often contain substantial quantities of nitrogen compounds and such nitrogen compounds must be removed therefrom to allow downstream processing and avoid low quality fuels. One way of removing such nitrogen compounds comprises the hydrodenitrogenating of the hydrocarbon stream in the presence of hydrogen, under suitable conditions., and in the presence of a suitable catalyst. While the catalyst and process of the present invention can be used to treat a hydrocarbon stream containing a substantial amount of nitrogen compounds, they can be used also to treat a hydrocarbon stream that contains less than 0.2 wt nitrogen. The catalyst of the present invention, which catalyst is suitable as a catalyst for the hydrodenitrogenation of hydrocarbon streams containing a substantial amount of nitrogen compounds, is, broadly, a catalyst which comprises a hydrogenation component comprising chromium, molybdenum, and at least one metal from Group VIII of the Periodic Table of Elements deposed upon a porous alumina silica support, the silica of said support being present in an amount within the range of about 10. wt to about 50 wt , based upon the weight of said support, and said chromium, molybdenum, and metal from Group VIII being present in the elemental form, as oxides, as sulfides, or mixtures thereof. The hydrogenation component comprises chromium, molybdenum, and at least one metal from Group VIII of the Periodic Table of Elements. The Periodic Table ofElements can be found on page 628 of WEBSTER S SEVENTHNEW COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY, G. C. Merriam Company,Springfield, Massachusetts, U.S.A. 1963 . Preferably, the Group VIII metal is a non noble metal. Cobalt and nickel are those members of Group VIII that are preferred for the catalyst of the present invention. The components of the hydrogenation component are present in the elemental form, as oxides, as sulfides, or mixtures thereof.The chromium is present in an amount within the range of about 3 wt to about 15 wt , calculated as Cr203 the molybdenum, in an amount within the range of about 5 wt to about 25 wt , calculated as MoO3 and the metal fromGroup VIII, in an amount within the range of about 0.5 wt to about 10 wt , calculated as the oxide each amount being based upon the weight of the catalyst.Preferably, the chromium is present in an amount within the range of about 7 wt to about 12 wt , calculated as Cr203 the molybdenum, in an amount within. the range of about 12 wt to about 18 wt , calculated as MoO3 and the metal from Group VIII, in an amount within the range of about 1 wt to about 5 wt , calculated as the oxide each amount being based upon the weight of the catalyst. The support of the catalyst is an alumina silica support, that is, it is a mixture of silica and alumina wherein the silica is present in an amount within the range of about 10 wt to about 50 wt , preferably within the range of about 15 wt to about 45 wt , based upon the weight of said support. It is not the typical silica alumina cracking catalyst which contains from about 65 wt to about 95 wt silica.Moreover, it is not the usual silica stabilized alumina, which contains up to about 5 wt silica. The catalyst of the present invention is prepared by depositing chromium, molybdenum, and a Group VIII metal upon a porous refractory support or carrier comprising silica and alumina, the silica being present in an amount within the range of about 10 wt to about 50 wt , based upon the weight of the support. A suitable method for depositing such hydrogenation metals upon the support comprises the impregnation of the support material with compounds of the metals.Desirably, after the hydrogenation metals are deposited upon the support, the material is formed into pellets, or is extruded, and then calcined. The alumina silica support is prepared conveniently by co precipitation from suitable sources of silicon and aluminum, such as silica sols, alumina sols, and mixtures thereof. The sol or mixture of sols can be gelled by the addition of a suitable gelling medium, such as ammonium hydroxide, dried, and calcined. The catalyst can be prepared by any suitable method for impregnating the hydrogenation component upon the high surface area refractory inorganic oxide support. Such impregnation can be performed with one or more solutions, usually aqueous, of heat decomposable compounds of the appropriate metals. If a single solution is employed, the impregnation is a co impregnation. Alternatively, sequential impregnation of the metals from 2 or more solutions can be employed. Generally, the impregnated support is dried at a temperature of at least 2500F 1210C for a period of at least one hour and calcined in air at a temperature of at least 8000F 4270C , and preferably, at least 1,000 F 5380C , for at least one hour. The finished catalyst that is employed in the process of the present invention should have a pore volume within the range of about 0.4 cc gm to about 1.0 cc gm, a surface area within the range of about 150 m2 gm to about 350 m2 gm, and an average pore diameter within the range of about 60 Angstrom units 6 nm to about 150 15 nm . Preferably, the catalyst has a pore volume within the range of about 0.4 cc gm to about 0.8 cc gm, a surface area within the range of about 150 m2 gm to about 250 m2 gm, and an average pore diameter within the range of about 80 8 nm to about 150 15 nm . Values specified or catalyst surface area were obtained by the BET nitrogen adsorption method.Values specified for pore volume herein were also obtained by nitrogen adsorption, and specified average pore diameters were those that were calculated by means of the expression A.P.D. 4 x P.V. x 104 S.A.wherein A.P.D. average pore diameter in A, P.V. pore volume in cc gm, and S.A. surface area in m2 gm. The catalyst of the present invention is characterized by the following apparent pore size distribution, as would be obtained by a Digisorb 2500 instrument employing nitrogen desorption techniques 10 to 35 of the total pore volume in pores having diameters less than 50 5 nm 30 to 65 of the total pore volume in pores having diameters within the range of 50 5 nm to 100 10 nm and 5 to 40 of the total pore volume in pores having diameters greater than 100 10 nm . The term apparent pore size distribution is used, since the large range of catalyst support composition values makes it very difficult to fix ranges of values for the pore size distribution. An advantage of the catalyst of the present invention is its high temperature stability, i.e., its ability to perform satisfactorily at high temperatures over an extended period of time. The use of a high temperature hastens the denitrogenation reaction and does not appear to affect deleteriously the performance of the catalyst. The chromium in the hydrogenation component of the catalyst provides the high temperature stability. The combination of a GroupVIII metal and molybdenum affords an active component for hydrogenation, denitrogenation and desulfurization.The presence of silica affords sufficient acidity to promote denitrogenation. The acidity of the catalyst of the present invention can be enhanced by the addition of a halogen, for example, fluorine or chlorine. Prior to its use in the process o f the present invention, the catalyst is subjected to a sulfiding pretreatment. This sulfiding pretreatment is necessary because the metal constituents of the hydrogenation component should be in a partially reduced state. The sulfiding will provide such partiallyreduced metals, but will not reduce the metals completely to the elemental form, which form is inactive. A convenient sulfiding pretreatment comprises heating the catalyst to a temperature within the range of about 2500F 1210C to about 3500F 1770C , passing a gas mixture of hydrogen sulfide in hydrogen over and through the catalyst at a variable pressure for a period of about 0.5 hour to about 2 hours, raising the temperature to a value within the range of about 3500F 1770C to about 4500F 2320C ,continuing to pass the gas mixture at this latter temperature over and through the catalyst for an additional period of about 0o5 hour to about 2 hours, raising the temperature to a value of about 6500F 3430C to about 7500F 3990C , and continuing to pass the hydrogen sulfide hydrogen gas mixture through the catalyst for an additional period of about 0.5 hour to about 2 hours. Suitably, sufficient gas should be employed to provide about 110 of the stoichiometric amount of hydrogen sulfide needed to sulfide the metals of the hydrogenation component. The concentration of hydrogen sulfide in the gas is not critical. Subsequently, hydrogencontaining gas is introduced into the reactor and permitted to flow through the catalyst at operating pressure. A suitable flow rate for the hydrogencontaining gas is the hydrogen addition rate provided hereinbelow. The hydrocarbon feed to be treated by the process can then be introduced into the reactor. While the above sulfiding pretreatment is a convenient way of pretreating the catalyst, other suitable methods known to those skilled in the art can be employed. For example, carbon disulfide can be added to the zone containing the catalyst, or a light hydrocarbon oil containing sulfur can be passed over the catalyst for a time that is sufficient to provide the appropriate metal sulfides on the catalyst. The catalyst of the present invention is employed in the process of the present invention in the form of a fixed bed or as an ebullated bed of particles. In the case of a fixed bed catalyst, the particle size of the catalyst should be within the range of about 1 32 in. 0.08 cm to about 1.8 in. 0.32 cm effective diameter. The catalyst of the present invention can be used conveniently in a fixed bed in the form of pellets, spheres, or extrudates. It is contemplated further that the catalyst can be present as other shapes, such as a clover leaf, cross shaped, or Cshaped, as disclosed by Hoekstra, et al., in UnitedStates Patents 3,674,680 and 3,764,565. The conditions that are employed in the process of the present invention comprise a temperature within the range of about 7000F 3710C to about 8000F 4270C , a hydrogen partial pressure within the range of about 1,000 psi 6,890 kPa to about 2,500 psi 17,225 kPa , a liquid hourly space velocity LHSV within the range of about 0.1 volume of hydrocarbons per hour per volume of catalyst to about 5 volumes of hydrocarbon per hour per volume of catalyst, and a hydrogen recycle rate or hydrogen addition rate within the range of about 2,000 standard cubic feet of hydrogen per barrel of hydrocarbon SCFB 359 m3 m3 to about 20,000 SCFB 3,596 m3 m3 .Preferably, the conditions comprise a temperature within the range of about 7400F 3930C to about 7900F 416dC , a hydrogen partial pressure within the range of about 1,600 psi 11,024 kPa to about 2,000 psi 13,780 kPa , a LHSV within the range of about 0.3 volume of hydrocarbon per hour per volume of catalyst to about 2 volumes of hydrocarbon per hour per volume of catalyst, and a hydrogen recycle rate or hydrogen addition rate within the range of about 6,000 SCFB 1,079 m3 m3 to about 14,000 SCFB 2,517 m3 m3 . The following specific examples are being presented in order to facilitate the understanding of the present invention and are presented for the purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. Eight catalysts were prepared and tested for their ability to hydrodenitrogenate a whole shale oil that had been obtained from in situ retorting of oil shale by the Occidental Petroleum Corporation. Each of the eight catalysts and the test of that particular catalyst are presented in one of the following Examples I through VIII. Example I A catalyst, identified hereinafter as Catalyst A, was prepared to contain 1.5 wt CoO, 10 wt Cr2O.3, and 10 wt MoO3 on a support of silica. A 154 gram portion of large mesh silica gel in the form of 8 14 mesh particles, i.e., particles that would pass through an 8 mesh screen Tyler but be retained upon a 14 mesh screen Tyler , obtained from the Davison Chemical Division of W. R. Grace Co., which had been calcined at a temperature of 1,0000F 5380C , was impregnated with a solution that had been prepared by dissolving 32.6 grams of NH4 2Cr2O7 in 145 milliliters of distilled water. After the composite had been mixed and had been left standing for several hours, the material was put into a vacuum oven at a temperature of 212 CF 1000C overnight approximately 16 hours and then calcined for 16 hours in static air at a temperature of 1,000 F 5380C . The calcined material was then impregnated with a solution that had been prepared by dissolving 11.4 grams of Co NO3 2.6H2O and 24.0 grams of NH4 6Mo7024.4H2O in distilled water and adding sufficient distilled water to make a volume of 120 milliliters of solution. The solution was poured over the catalyst and mixed therewith. Upon mixing, the solid material became dry therefore, excess distilled water was added and mixed with the solid material periodically. The material was left overnight approximately 16 hours in still air at ambient temperature. The next day it was dried under a heat lamp and then in a vacuum oven for about 4 hours at a temperature of about 2120F 1000C . The dried material was then calcined in air at a temperature of 1,0000F 5380C overnight approximately 16 hours .The calcined material, Catalyst A, was ground subsequently to a 14 20 mesh material, i.e ., a material that would pass through a 14 mesh screen Tyler , but be retained upon a 20 mesh screen Tyler . Catalyst A was tested in an automated hydrotreating pilot plant, as were all of the other catalysts discussed hereinafter. This bench scale test unit had automatic controls for pressure, flow of reactants, and temperature. The reactor was made from 3 8 inch 9.5mm inside diameter, stainless steel, heavy walled tubing.A 1 81 3mm outsidediameter thermowell extended up through the center of the reactor. The reactor was heated by an electrically heated steel block. The hydrocarbon feedstock was fed to the unit by means of a Ruska pump, a positive displacement pump. The 14 20 mesh material was supported on 8 10 mesh alundum particles, i.e., particles that would pass through an 8 mesh screen Tyler , but be retained upon a 10 mesh screen Tyler . Approximately 20 cubic centimeters of the 14 20 mesh catalyst were employed as the catalyst bed in this test, as well as in each of the tests discussed hereinafter. This amount of catalystpro vided a length of catalyst bed of about 10 25cm about 12 30cm .A layer of 8 10 mesh alundum particles was placed over the catalyst to fill the top part of the reactor. The catalyst was located in the annular space between the thermowell and the internal wall of the 3 g 9mm inside diameter reactor. After Catalyst A was loaded into the reactor, it was subjected to the following sulfiding pretreatment.The temperature of the catalyst bed was raised to about 3000F 1490C and a mixture of 8 hydrogen sulfide in hydrogen was passed through the catalyst bed at a variable pressure. At the end of approximately 1 hour, the temperature was raised to about 4000F 2040C and the hydrogen sulfide containing gas was passed over or through the catalyst for an additional hour. Then the temperature was raised to 7000F 3710C and the hydrogen sulfide hydrogen gas mixture was passed through the catalyst for an additional hour, at which time its flow was stopped. At least one standard cubic foot 28t of or hydrogen hydrogen sulfide gas, preferably at least 1 standard cubic foot 28e of gas per hour, had been passed through the catalyst bed. Hydrogen gas was then introduced into the reactor and allowed to flow through the catalyst bed at a pressure of 1,800 psi 12,402 kPa at a flow rate of about 15 liters per hour. The Ruska pump was started, hydrocarbon feed was permitted to flow through the reactor, and the temperature of the catalyst bed was raised to the appropriate reaction temperature.Effluent from the reaction zone was passed into a gas liquid high pressure separator, wherein the gas was separated from the liquid. The gas was passed through a pressure control valve and a wet test meter to an appropriate vent. The liquid product was passed through a pressure control valve to a liquid product receiver. Catalyst A was tested at a liquid feed rate of 10.3 cubic centimeters per hour, i.e., a LHSV of 0.5 volume of hydrocarbon per hour per volume of catalyst, and a catalyst bed temperature of approximately 7800F 4160C . The feedstock that was employed in this test, as well as in the tests of the other examples, was a whole shale oil that had been obtained by in situ retorting of oil shale by the Occidental PetroleumCorporation.

A 617 gram portion of Aero 100A alumina 1 16 inch 0.159 cm extrudates obtained from the AmericanCyanamid Company and calcined in air at 1,000CF 538CC for at least 1 hour was impregnated with a solution that had been prepared by dissolving 132.8 grams of NH4 2Cr207 and 98.12 grams of NH4 6Mo7024.4H20 in 300 milliliters of distilled water. In making up the solution, it was stirred for approximately one half hour and distilled water was added to make 600 cubic centimeters of solution. Since not all of the solids had been dissolved, approximately 50 cubic centimeters of dilute ammonium hydroxide were added, the solution was filtered, and sufficient water was added to bring the total amount of solution up to 700 cubic centimeters.The addition of the solution to the 617 grams of alumina resulted in a slurry. The excess solution became a cloudy orange upon standing. The mixture was shaken occasionally and was left standing overnight approximately 16 hours . Since the mixture still contained liquid, it was dried under a heat lamp with stirring. It was then left standing at room temperature over the weekend approximately 64 hours . The material was then dried in air overnight at a temperature of 212CF 100CC . It was screened to remove alumina chips and powder. Subsequently it was calcined in air at a temperature of 1,000 F 5380C for one hour. A 193 gram portion of the calcined material was impregnated with a solution that had been prepared by dissolving 11.65 grams of Co NO3 2.6H2O in 130 cubic centimeters of distilled water. The solution was added slowly to the solid material to provide only a very slight excess of free solution. The material was then dried under a heat lamp with occasional stirring for approximately 1 hour, dried in an oven in air at a temperature of 212 F 100CC for 20 hours, and calcined in air at a temperature of 1,0000F 538CC for 1 hour.The calcined material, Catalyst B, was ground and screened to a 14 20 mesh material, i.e., a material that would pass through a 14 mesh screen Tyler , but be retained upon a 20 mesh screen Tyler . A 20 cubic centimeter sample of Catalyst B was charged to the reactor of a bench scale test unit, pretreated, and tested with Feed A, as described inExample I hereinabove. The results of this test, TestNo. 2, are presented hereinbelow in Table III. A comparison of the results obtained in TestNo. 1 to those in Test No. 2 shows that the aluminasupported catalyst was somewhat better than the silicasupported catalyst for nitrogen removal.

A 147 gram quantity of Aero 100A alumina, obtained from American Cyanamid Company, in the form of 1 16 inch 0.159 m3 m3 extrudates was impregnated with a solution that had been prepared by dissolving 33.2 grams of NH4 2Cr207 in 145 milliliters of distilled water.The alumina extrudates had been calcined in air at a temperature of 1,000 F 538CC for at least 1 hour prior to the impregnation. The solution and extrudates were thoroughly mixed. Upon standing for a period of time, the mixture was heated overnight about 16 hours in a vacuum oven at a temperature of about 212 F 100 C . Then the dried material was calcined in air at a temperature of 1,000 F 538CC for 3 hours. The calcined material was impregnated with a solution that had been prepared by dissolving 11.65 grams of Co NO3 2.6H2O and 36.8 grams of NH4 6Mo7024. 41120 in sufficient distilled water to make 120 milli. liters of solution. The mixture of solution and calcined solid was allowed to stand for 1 hour, dried in a vacuum oven for 2 hours at a temperature of 212 CF 100 C , and calcined at a temperature of 1,000 F 538CC overnight approximately 16 hours . The resulting calcined catalyst, Catalyst C, was ground and screened to a 14 20 mesh material. A 20 cubic centimeter sample of Catalyst C was charged to the reactor of a bench scale test unit, pretreated, and tested with Feed A, as described inExample I hereinabove. The results of this test, TestNo. 3, are presented hereinbelow in Table IV. A comparison of the results obtained in Test No.2 to those in Test No. 3 shows that the catalyst containing the 15 wt MoO3 was slightly better for nitrogen removal.

The support material containing 70 wt silica and 30 wt alumina was obtained from W. R. Grace and Co. A 147 gram portion of this support material as 1 8 inch 0.318 cm pellets was impregnated with a solution that had been prepared by dissolving 33.2 grams of NH4 2Cr2O7 in 140 milliliters of distilled water. The resulting composite was allowed to stand for 1 hour and dried under a heat lamp and in an oven overnight approximately 16 hours at a temperature of 250CF 121 C . The dried material was then calcined in air at a temperature of 1,000 F 5380C for about 4 hours. The calcined material was impregnated with a solution that had been prepared by dissolving 33.2 grams of 4 6Mo7024.4H2O and 11.68 grams of Co NO3 2.6H2O in distilled water and adding sufficient distilled water to make 125 cubic centimeters of solution. After standing for about 0.5 hour, the composite was dried under a heat lamp for about 0.5 hour and then in an oven for 1 hour at a temperature of about 250 F 121 C . The dried material was calcined in air overnight approximately 16 hours at a temperature of I,000 F 538CC . A 20 cubic centimeter sample of Catalyst H was charged, as 14 20 mesh material, to the reactor of a bench scale test unit, pretreated, and tested withFeed A, as described hereinabove in Example I.

In this figure, the amount of nitrogen in the product is plotted versus the amount of silica in the catalyst support. The amount of nitrogen in the product for each test was obtained as an arithmetic average of the values of the nitrogen level for the first seven days of that test. If an obvious upset or irregularity was associated with a particular value, that value was not included in the average. The figure demonstrates that a catalyst having a hydrogenation component as defined hereinabove and a support containing from about 10 wt silica to about 50 t silica will provide improved denitrogenation of a whole shale oil.
