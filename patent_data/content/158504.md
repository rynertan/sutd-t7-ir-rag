# Liquid treatment apparatus.

## Abstract
A hollow distributor arm 200 for a water filtration plant eg. a percolating filter has a series of jets 204 disposed along the arm to deliver liquid to be filtered from within the arm on to the filter bed 202 . To prevent the jets blocking, plungers 210 are mounted on the arm one plunger for each jet by support members 207 . Each support member is conveniently fixed to the arm at the jet itself. Preferably, the support member 207 is a strap moulded integrally with a body portion 209 from which the plunger projects. Periodically, the plungers are moved into their respective jets to clear obstructions therein.
