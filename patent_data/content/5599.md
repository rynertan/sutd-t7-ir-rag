# Two way filter drier.

## Abstract
A bi directional filter drier 30 especially for use in a heat pump system has an adsorption space for adsorbing material 35 . Each end of the space is closed off by a valve assembly 40 and a filter pad assembly 50 . The valve assembly 40 allows flow of liquid into but not out of the space. The pad assembly 50 includes a diaphragm 57 which allows flow of liquid out of the space through a filter pad 53 but not into the space. A line connector 33 is provided for liquid to flow into each valve assembly 40 and these connectors 33 may be used by liquid flowing out of the space through the pad assemblies 50 or separate discharge caps 94 may be provided.
