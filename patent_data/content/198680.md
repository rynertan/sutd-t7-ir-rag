# Guanidines production.

## Abstract
Bicyclic guanidines, useful as catalysts in a variety of chemical reactions, are produced by reacting a bis aminoal kyl amine at ambient or elevated temperature with a com pound of the formula CX₂ I or R¹ R² CX II wherein in the formulae I and II X is either oxygen or sulphur and R¹ and R² in the formula II are independently either halogen atoms, NH₂ groups, or alkoxide groups, for example carbon disul phide.
