## Abstract
The invention consists of an anchoring support 3 for laser devices in which the laser rod 5 is contained in a rod holder 2 preferably of steel with a low coefficient of expansion or invar, firmly anchored to a base plate 4 pref erably of granite which is the same as that which is also used to support the mirrors.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. Rigid support for laser devices characterized by the fact that the laser rod is anchored to the same support as that which supports the mirrors and comprises a base plate of material with a low expansion coefficient on which the mirrors are fixed together with an anchoring element con taining the laser rod firmly fixed to the said base plate. 2. Rigid support for laser devices characterized by the fact that the material forming the said base plate is granite. 3. Rigid support for laser devices characterized by the fact that the said anchoring element is made of steel with a low expansion coefficient or of invar.

## Description
RIGID SUPPORT FOR LASER DEVICESThis invention is concerned with a rigid support for laser devices.In particular by means of this invention a support device for the laser rod is realized which isolates the rod itself from all movements, especially of thermic origin, which could cause deterioration of the laser operation.As is known the action of the laser is typically linked to the precision and stability of the alignment of the two mirrors which form the resonant cavity and to the precision with which these in theirtuln are aligned with the active element. The axis which ideally unites the two mirrors and passes through the centre of the active element is called the system optical axis.This axis, in order to obtain the sxxinllm output performance, must obviously be perpendicular to the two mirrors while with respect to the active element whether solid or gaseous it must be either perpendicular or respect a precise incidence Brewster angle . Any variation from this condition degrades the performance of the source. In the solid state lasers the active element is a rod of material which must be supported together with the illuminating lamp and pump cavity whether reflecting or diffused for which reason it is necessary to make use of differently constructed containers.The present tendency in the environment of industrial applications is to realize a body of transparent plastic which has typically two advantageous features the first concerns the low cost of realization, the second is the elimination of the problem of insulating the lamp trigger.In this solution the rod, by means of its support, is directly anchored to the plastic body.This is not technically correct in as far as the optical axis is fixed ontoB body not completely rigid plastic in which the coefficient of expansion is contained within 80 160 p.p.m. oc. Since part of the power fed into the lamp 50 must be dissipated by the plastic container, especially at high pump power 6kw stresses are created which lead to a misalignment of the rod with respect to the mirrors. This misalignment causes a reduction of the power. Further, working under conditions of pbor alignment the competition between the modes of oscillation results in a fluctuation of the output power itself and the divergence of the beam.Obviously this type of system is very sensitive to variations of temperature and therefore cannot be used in military systems whose field of application typically varies from 400 to 55 C. In the solution proposed in this invention the laser rod is anchored by means of a rod holder of a suitable material to the same support as that which supports the mirrors.The invention will now be described with reference to figure 1 in which 1 indicates the mirrors, 2 the rod holder, 3 the relative supports, 4 the stiffened base and 5 the laser rod. The laser beam is shown by the arrow.Therefore in this solution the whole structure which supports the lamp, the pump cavity and the refrigeration circuit forms a part independent of the rod, and all its movements whether of thermic origin or not are damped by the 0 ring holding the refrigeration liquid.In this way every part of the container is completely separated from the optical axis of the laser, thus rendering the construction free of certain requirements which were formerly of first importance such as robustness since it also had to support the rod and therefore large size and the necessity of having a high heat dissipation coefficient to diminish the movements of the container itself. The invention in question considerably improves the stability of high power solid state lasers and allows the construction of sources with high characteristics, even at TEMoo, stable in time.Further, having rendered the optical axis independent of the container, it makes possible the use of high powers for feeding the lamp, something which was impossible with the configurations in use up to the present time due to the stresses which the container undergoes and which have repercussions on the performance of the source.A typical material for the base plate is granite whose coefficient of expansion is rv 1 p.p.m. C. The rod is anchored to the granite support by means of a rodholder which may be made of steel with a low coefficient of expansion on possibly invar 1 p.p.m. OC .
