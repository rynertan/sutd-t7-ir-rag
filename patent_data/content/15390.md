# Method and apparatus for performing growth of thin films of a compound.

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus are provided for perfor ming growth of compound thin films by alternately repea ting separate surface reactions of the substances compri sing the compound. A carrier gas affects a diffusion bar rier between the surface reaction steps to be separated from each other. The gas phase diffusion barrier is also applied to separate the source regions 12 of different reacting vapors both from each other and from the surface reaction zone.
