# Control circuit for energizing an electrically ignited load.

## Abstract
An electrically ignited load such as a fusehead 40 is connected to the secondary winding 52 of a transformer. The secondary winding is magnetically linked to a primary winding 54 through a magnetic circuit and the transformer is constructed so as to provide a substantial leakage inductance associated with the secondary winding and effectively connected in series with the load 30 to be ignited. The structure selectively passes electrical ignition energy to the load only in response to input electrical energy having predetermined magnitude and frequency characteristics.
