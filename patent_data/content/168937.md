# Buckle.

## Abstract
The pivoted jaws 2,3 of a buckle for a strap 4 are held together by fastening means 22, 23 which define a first closed position of the buckle, but which are such as to allow closer approach of the jaws when they squeeze the strap between them. A moment is exerted, if the strap is pulled, between an edge 9 over which it is turned and which is offset from the pivot 10 and this has the effect of causing closer approach of the jaws and thus an increasedly positive hold. Teeth 20 on one of the jaws are of a saw tooth profile to permit movement of the strap in one direction even when the buckle is closed. Both jaws may be respective one piece integral plastics mouldings.
