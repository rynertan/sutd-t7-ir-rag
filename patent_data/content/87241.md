# End closure for sausage casings.

## Abstract
A strand 1 of sausage casing is closed at one end by an end closure 13 formed by coating the inner surface of an end portion with adhesive and crimping opposite sides together to form a seal, a restricted air passage being left through the seal. The strand is preferably a shirred 2 strand of a thin walled collagen sausage casing 1 , the adhesive being collagen hydrolysate and the seal being heated during the crimping. A method of, and apparatus for, end closing a strand of sausage casing are described.
