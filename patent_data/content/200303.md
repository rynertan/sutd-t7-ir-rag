# Measurement of a small most dense constituent layer in a stratified mixture.

## Abstract
A complex liquid, such as a biological liquid, is stratified, as by centrifugation in a tube 2 , into constituent layers. The most dense or heaviest constituent layer A is measured volumetrically by physically expanding the entire layer with a cylindrical float 6 which is inserted in the tube 2 and which occupies the portion of the tube also occupied by the constituent layer being measured. The axial extent of the expanded layer A is measured to provide an indication of the volume of the layer being measured. The end of the tube 2 proximate to the layer being measured contains a plug 12 of a more dense material which is immiscible with the subject liquid and into which the float 6 will settle during centrifugation. The float 6 thus settles into the plug 12 of dense material and floats therein so as to extend through the entirety of the layer A being measured.
