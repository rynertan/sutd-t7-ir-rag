# Liquid fuel and air feed apparatus for fluidized bed boiler.

## Abstract
A fluidized bed furnace 10 is provided in which liquid fuel can be burned. Injectors 50 extend up through an imperforate bed plate 52 which properly mix the oil or other liquid fuel with the fluidizing air causing evaporation of the oil. This mixture is passed through restricted openings 64 as it enters the fluidized bed, thus resulting in high velocity flow and fairly even fuel and combustion distribution throughout the cross section of the fluidized bed.
