# Radio reception system for a phase modulation signal.

## Abstract
A radio receiver for a PM phase modulationj signal trans mission system which includes spectrum scrambling for the relocation of speech spectra for privacy purposes comprises an antenna 21 for receiving PM modulated signals, an FM de modulator 22 coupled to the antenna, a spectrum de scram bler 23 connected to the output of the FM demodulator, and an integrating circuit 24 connected to the output of the spec trum de scrambler. Due to the positioning of the de scrambler, i.e. between the FM demodulator and the integration circuit, the noise spectrum in the received signal is independent of the design of the spectrum scambler, and a good signal to noise ra tio is obtained despite the spectrum scrambling.
