# IMPROVEMENTS IN ARTIFICIAL LIMBS AND FITTINGS THEREFOR

## Abstract
An artificial leg includes a low height knee unit 1 pivoted on bolt 3 within a shin unit 2 . The top face of the knee unit is formed with a generally frustoconical socket 32 formed at its mouth with a concave spherical seat 30 . First, second and third screws 31 at 120 degree angular spacings fit in threaded bores so as to be tightened against recessed surfaces 25 formed on a head 24 of a male member having a convex spherical surface 22 that mates with seat 30 . So manipulation of screws 31 permits the male member to be moved relative to the socket within a permitted range of adjustment. The shin unit is vertically extended to accommodate within it a swing phase control unit 12, 13 connected between the knee unit at pivot 14 posterior of knee pivot 12 and the shin unit at pivot 15 located just above shin tube 18 . A resilient buffer 6 terminates pivotal motion in extension between the knee unit 1 and the shin unit 2 and a lock pawl 8 pivoted at 9 within the shin unit may be released by an operating cable 40, 41 . The lower end of the shin tube 18 may be attached to the foot by a clamp not shown having three adjustable screws like the screws 31 about a frustoconical socket and receiving a male clamping member formed with a convex spherical surface and a head having three recessed faces engaged by the screws.
