# Conversion of certain hydrocarbons using divalent copper containing ZSM 5 type catalyst.

## Abstract
By product effluent streams from pyrolytic hydrocarbon cracking processes, containing monoolefins and diolefins, are treated to hydrogenate the olefins and to aromatize the aliphatics, with a catalyst essentially comprising divalent copper containing ZSM 5 type molecular sieve catalyst.
