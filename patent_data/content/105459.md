After stirring for 20 minutes at 100C, the reaction mixture was poured into a mixture of tetrahydrofuran 100 ml , ethyl acetate 100 ml and water 100 ml , and then adjusted to pH 6.0 with 20 aqueous sodium hydroxide. The resultant aqueous layer was separated and washed with ethyl acetate under keeping the pH value at 6.0. This solution was subjected to chromatography on aluminum oxide.The fractions eluted with 3 aqueous sodium acetate were collected and adjusted to pH 4.0 with 10 hydrochloric acid. This solution was further chromatographed on nonionic adsorption resin Diaion HP 20 Trademark, manufactured by MitsubishiChemical Industries . The fractions eluted with 20 aqueous acetone were collected, concentrated in vacuo and adjusted to pH 2.0 with 10 hydrochloric acid. The resultant precipitate was collected by filtration and dried in vacuo to give 7 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 hydroxyiminoacetamido 3 vinyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid syn isomer 1.23 g .

To this solution was added 4 bromoacetoacetyl bromide obtained from diketene 224 ml and bromine 147 ml in methylene chloride at 20 C and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at 150C. The reaction mixture was poured into a mixture of ethyl acetate 12 Q and water 6 t . The organic layer was separated, washed with an aqueous sodium chloride, and then evaporated in vacuo.The resultant precipitate was stirred in diisopropyl ether 10 k for 1 hour at OOC, and the obtained crystals were collected by filtration and dried in vacuo to give benzhydryl 7 4 bromoacetoacetamido 3 vinyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylate 1.27 kg , mp 133 137 C dec. .
