# PROGRAMMABLE OUTPUT POLARITY DEVICES

## Abstract
Disclosed is an apparatus for generating an output signal having a selected output polarity. The apparatus comprises a sensing means for generating a logic signal upon occurrence of an event. Also, a programmable means generates a program mable signal indicating a selected output polarity. The logic sig nal and the programmable signal are received by polarity set ting means for producing an output signal equal to the logic sig nal with the selected output polarity. Also disclosed is a testing means for temporarily forcing the programmable signal to indi cate a selected output polarity for testing.
