# Fuel injection pump with plunger stroke control.

## Abstract
A rotary fuel injection pump having a rotary charge pump and a stroke mechanism for variably limiting the outward stroke of a pair of diametrically opposed reciproc able pumping plungers of the charge pump for controlling the fuel charge measure delivered by the charge pump. Several embodiments of a stroke control mechanism are disclosed which include a generally U shaped abutment yoke mounted within a diametral slot in the pump rotor for engagement by inclined ramps on the outer ends of the charge pump plungers and axially adjustable within the rotor slot for variably limiting the outward stroke of the plungers.
