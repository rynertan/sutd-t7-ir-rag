# Laundry washing machine of the top charging type provided with a counterweight.

## Abstract
Described is a laundry washing machine of the top charging tyle, particularly for domestic use, comprising a tub drum assembly resiliently suspended within a frame, and a counterweight for the dynamic equilibration of the tub drum assembly. According to the invention, the counter weight is mounted on the top portion of the tub and formed with a central through opening registering with a charging port in the frame of the machine and an access opening of the tub, a flexible element being connected between said charging port and said central through opening. The de scribed location of the counterweight permits the weight and dimensions thereof to be considerably reduced as compared to known constructions.

## Description
D e s c r i p t i o nS C r i p t i 0 fl The present invention relates to a laundry washing machine of the top charging type, particularly for domestic use, provided with a counterweight for the dynamic equilibration of the tub drum assembly of the machine.As generally known, laundry washing machines of the topcharging type are at present being constructed to have the smallest possible dimensions so as to permit them to be installed in limited spaces.The efficient dynamic equilibration of the tub drum assembly of laundry washing machines of this type requires the employ of at least one counterweight formed of a material having a high specific weight. This material may be contained in a suitably formed container or may itself be formed to a compact block. The counterweight is generally attached to the outer periphery of the tub at a lower or lateral portion thereof. This manner of mounting the counterweight requires it to be considerably heavy and thus to have relatively great dimensions, so that the accommodation of the counterwieght in a washing machine of reduced dimensions offers considerable difficulties.It is therefore an object of the present invention to eliminate this disadvantage by providing a counterweight of the described type which is mounted on the top portion of the tub of the machine adjacent the access opening thereof.The location of the counterweight in this position results in an upwards displacement of the center of gravity of the tub drum assembly, whereby the lever arm of the center of gravity with respect to the suspension points of the tubdrum assembly within the frame of the machine is correspondingly shortened.This permits a counterweight of reduced weight and dimens ions as compared to hitherto employed counterweights to be employed for ensuring an efficient dynamic equilibration of the tub drum assembly.As a result, there is considerably more space available in the washing machine for mounting the counterweight itself or for installing the various electrical and mechanical components of the machine. In adcition. tfle formation of the counterweight requires a smaller amount of material, with the attendant economical advantagesThese and other objects are attained according to the invention by a laundry washing machine of the top charging type, particularly for domestic use, comprising a tub suspended in a frame of the machine, a drum rotatably mounted ifl said tub and provided with two spring biased peripheral doors adapted to partially overlap one another in the close position, and at least one counterweight of a material having a high specific weight for the dynamic equilibration of the tub drum assembly, said tub being provided with G top opening giving access to said drum.In accordance with the invention, a laundry washing machine of the above specified type is characterized in that said counterweight is formed with at least one central throughopening and is mounted on the top portion of said tub, so that said through opening coincides with said access opening and with a charging port formed in the frame of the machine, flexible means being provided for connection to the respective peripheral borders of said counterweight and said charging portThe characteristics of the invention will become more evident from the following description, given by way of a nonlimiting example with reference to the accompanying draw lungs, wherein fig. 1 shows a partially sectioned elevational view of a top portion of a laundry washing machine of the top charging type provided with a counterweight according to the invention, and fig. 2 shows a perspective view of the counterweight accord ing to the invention as applied to the tub drum assembly of a laundry washing machine of the top charging type.Shown in figs. 1 and 2 of the drawings is a laundry washing machine of the top charging type, comprising a washing tub 3 suspended within an outer frame It by means of a not shown system of upper springs and lower shock absorbers, and 2 drum 5 rotatably mounted within tub 3 and provided with a peripheral opening 6 adapted to be closed by springbiased door flaps 7, only one of which is shown in fig. 1, adapted to overlap one another in the closed position.Formes in tre upper portion of tub 3 is a through opening 8 giving access to drum 5 for introducing and discharging the laundry into and out of drum 5, respectively.For ensuring an efficient dynamic equilibration of the tub drum assembly 3 5, there is in addition provided a counterweight 9 formed of a material having a high specific weight, such as cement, baryte or the like, which may be contained within a suitably shaped container or be formed as a compact block of the selected material.Counterweight 9 is formed with at least one central throughopening 10 and with a channel shaped outer peripheral rim 11 for purposes to be described later.For mounting counterweight 9 in the laundry washing machine, it is located on the top portion of tub 3 in such a position that its through opening 10 coincides with a charging port 12 formed in the frame of the machine thereabove, and with the access opening 8 of the tub. In this position the counter weight is subsequently affixed to the tub of the machine by means of bolts 13 and nuts 14 or equivalent fastener elements.Charging port 12 is surrounded by a frame structure 15 acting as a charging funnel and having a free edge 16 partially projecting into the interior of the machine.Connected retween the free edge portion 16 of frame structure 15 and charnel shaped outer peripheral rim 11 of counterweight g ic bellows shaped flexible element 17 for permitting the laundry to be safely introduced into and withdraw. from drum 5. For connecting flexible element 17 to frame structure 15, the free egde portions 16 and 18, respect e t, cf the frame structure and the flexible element rct into contact with each other, whereupon a profiled rigid clamping element 19 is slipped onto the contacting edge portions.The other free edge portion 20 of flexible element 17 is introduced ntc the channel shaped edge 11 of counterweight 9 and retained therein by means of an expansible annular member 21. The flexible element 17 may have a different shape and be connected between the charging port and the counterweight in a different manner without thereby leaving the scope of the inventionAs shown particularly in fig. 1, counterweight 9 is formed with to opposing lateral edge portions 22 partially projecting into opening 10 for being engaged by a hooks 23 provided on the door flaps of the drum, should the latter be rotated with its door flaps accidentally open. The described location of the counterweight on top of the tub of the washing machine results in an upwards displacement of the center of gravity of the tub drum assembly and thus in a shorter lever arm of the center of gravity with respect to the suspension points of the assembly within the frame of the machine.As a result, the dynamic equilibration of the said assembly is achieved by employign a counterweight of the same Material as abobe specified, although of reduced weight, so that the counterweight may be designed with reduced dimensions and formed of a reduced amount of material.As the dimensions of the counterweight are thus reduced, its accommodation within the frame of the machine as well as that of the other components thereof is greatly facilstated.
