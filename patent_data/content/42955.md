# Anti reversal device for printer ribbon cartridge take up spool.

## Abstract
Connected to the take up spool 26 of the ribbon cartridge 10 is a disc member 28 supporting a pair of flexible arms 32 with outwardly oriented pointed ends 34 . Ends 34 engage ratchet teeth 44 formed on the internal surface of a cylinder 42 forming part of, or attached to, the ribbon cartridge 10 . As disc 28 and arms 32 are rotated by the ribbon feed mechanism, arms 32 will flex and permit a rotation of disc 28 and take up spool 26 with a minimal drag force. Upon reversal, the ends 34 of arms 32 engage ratchet teeth 44 and arms 32 become compression columns resisting the rotation of disc 28 and spool 26 . Ends 34 of arms 32 are positioned such that they are one half tooth out of phase to ensure that one tooth is always in engagement with the end 34 of one of the two arms 32 .
