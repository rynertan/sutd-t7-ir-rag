# Electrodeless metal vapour discharge lamp.

## Abstract
An electrodeless metal vapour discharge lamp com prising a lamp vessel 1 which is sealed in a vacuum tight manner and is further filled with a rare gas, which lamp is provided with a core 4 of magnetic material, in which a high frequency magnetic field can be induced by means of an electric supply unit 7 and a winding 5 arranged to sur round the core, an electric field being produced in the lamp vessel 1 , the surface area of a cross section orthogonal to the axis of the winding lying between 20 mm² and 60 mm², the lamp vessel 1 containing as rare gas krypton and or argon at a pressure of at most 100 Pa, and the axial length of the winding lying between 8 and 15 mm.
