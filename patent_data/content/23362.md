## Description
An electrically conductive copper alloy material and a method for manufacturing the same The present invention relates to an electrically conductive copper alloy material having both electrical conductivity and mechanical strength, and a method for manufacturing the same. Although copper is excellent in electrical conductivity, the electrical conductivity of a copper alloy is necessarily less than that of pure copper.Therefore, it is general practice to use pure copper in electric wires, cables and the like where the electrical conductivity is very important. However, when a twisted wire is manufactured from pure copper, it is defective in that it tends to overstretch or it is often accidentally broken during the twisting process when the wire diameter is small. Thus, it is proposed to use a copper alloy member with an additive for improving the mechanical strength. However, this is not suitable for electric wires or the like where the electrical conductivity is of prime importance. For example, it is possible to improve the mechanical strength of chrome copper, zirconium copper and so on by the precipitation hardening treatment.However, this results in a lower electrical conductivity, and this method is not suitable for mass production of, for example, electric wires since the solution treatment and the precipitation hardening treatment must then be perfor.ted. The primary object of the present invention is therefore to provide a copper alloy material which eliminates the problems of the conventional copper alloy member and which has an electrical conductivity, mechanical strength and suitability for mass production compatible with use an electric wires. To the above and other objects, the present invention provides an electrically conductive copper alloy material whose grain size number is not less than 7 as defined by JIS G 0551. The present invention further provides a method for manufacturing an electrically conductive copper alloy material which is characterized by making an ingot, hot working it to a wire of suitable diameter, and, without subjecting it to the solution treatment, cold working it so as to provide a grain size number of not less than 7 as defined by JIS G 0551. The most important point of the present invention is the finding of a copper alloy material having a suitable electrical conductivity and mechanical strength by obtaining a grain size number of not less than 7, preferably 8 9 as defined by JIS G 0551 by preferably repeatedly annealing and working the copper alloy material without the solution treatment which has heretofore required a precipitation hardening treatment.The suitability for mass production obtained by eliminating the step of the solution treatment is also industrially advantageous. The crystal grain size as defined by JIS G 0551 is calculated as follows.EMI2.1 log n 1 0.301 Herein, N grain size number n the number of grains counted within 25 mm square as magnified 100 times M magnification of a microscope L1 or L2 the total length of the whole segments in the direction of one of the lines crossing at right angles 11 or 12 the total of the number of grains crossed by line L1 or L2 .

Making an ingot can be performed by general vacuum melting or atmospheric melting using a carbon melting pot. In the latter ingot making method, oxygen, for example, is degassed in the form of CO2 with the use of a carbon melting pot. When the cooling time after the melting of the alloy is shortened, the control of components which are liable to be oxidized can be easily carried out. In the easiest and most effective method, part of the desired copper base amounting about 10 in general of the total is thrown in after adding the additives for quenching the molten alloy. The base metal material preferably comprises a material containing little oxygen, such as a return material or oxygen free copper. Quenching in this case means fast cooling from a temperature of 1,200 1,2500C at which the additives are added to a casting temperature of 1,100 1,1500C within a period of only 1 2 minutes. This method which adopts a carbon melting pot, is especially advantageous for a chrome copper alloy, a zirconiumcopper alloy, a chrome zirconium copper alloy and so on. Chrome is preferably added in the form of a base alloy of chrome copper alloy. This is because the addition of metallic chrome tends to cause segregation due to a difference in melting points and small solid solubility. Zirconium may be added only for deoxidation or for inclusion in the alloy. Zirconium to be included in the alloy is added separately from zirconium for deoxidation. That is, after sufficiently deoxidizing with zirconium, more zirconium to be included in the alloy may be added. The addition of Zr is in general preferably performed at a temperature higher than the melting point of the copper alloy. For adding both chrome and zirconium, after adding a chrome copper base alloy, zirconium is added for deoxidation and more zirconium to be included in the alloy is added. This is because Zr is easily oxidized, and the addition of Zr is thus difficult before sufficiently deoxidizing the electrolytic copper.Special components such as silicon, germanium, mac3neslum, boron and so on are added after the deoxidation by zirconium as needed. This is because addition of these elements after sufficient deoxidation results in a better yield. Boron is added simultaneously with chrome as a base metal. The ingot making method of the Cr Zr Cu alloy may be summarized as follows 1 Placing the electrolytic copper in an amount which is about 10 by weight less than the required amount. 2 Raising the temperature to 1,080 1,1500C. 3 Melting the copper. 4 Adding the Cu Cr base alloy, Cu B base alloy and so on. 5 Adding a flux and removing the slag the flux is in general cryolite . 6 Raising the temperature to 1,200 1,2500C. 7 Adding Zr for deoxidation. 8 Adding a flux and removing the slag. 9 Adding Si, Ge, Mg, and so on. 10 Adding Zr. 11 Adding Cu the rest of the Cu in 1 for quenching to a temperature of 1,100 1,1500C. Then, adding a flux and removing the slag during this process. 12 Casting. The features of the copper alloy melted by this method are found to be the same as those of a copper alloy obtained by a conventional vacuum melting method, and have the following advantages. 1 It is possible to obtain products without an addition of an additive. 2 Inclusion of impurities will be effectively prevented. 3 Additives will be effectively alloyed with copper. 4 Segregation of additives will be effectively prevented. The atmospheric melting method which uses a carbon melting pot is advantageous in that it does not require special equipment as in the vacuum melting method and the manufacturing cost may be made less. This atmospheric melting method may be advantageously applicable particularly to alloys such as 0.05 1.5 Cr Cu, preferably 0.3 1.5t Cr Cu, more preferably 0.3 0.9 Cr Cu 0.05 0.5 Zr Cu, preferably 0.1 0.5 Zr Cu, more preferably 0.1 0.4 Zr Cu 0.3 1 Cr Cu, 0.1 0.5 Zr Cu and Cu alloys containing further 0.005 0.1, preferably 0.01 0.03 all by weight of silicon, germanium, boron or magnesium in addition to above ranges of Cr and Zr. The present invention will now be described in more detail taking as an example a copper alloy consisting of 0.81 by weight of chrome, 0.308 by weight of zirconium, and the rest, copper. In this example, the copper alloy material is repeatedly annealed and cold worked after hot working in order to obtain optimum results. The alloy of the above composition was hot worked at a temperature of 700 8500C by the atmospheric melting method using a carbon melting pot so as to obtain a wire of 7 10 mm in diameter. Then thus obtained wire was cold worked after acid cleaning into a wire of 2 mm in diameter. After annealing it at a temperature of 500 650 C, it was further cold worked into a wire of 0.26 mm in diameter. The characteristics of a copper alloy of cold working finish, a copper alloy of annealing finish at a temperature of 550 C, a copper alloy obtained by a conventional precipitation hardening treatment and pure copper are shown in Table II.

Thus, since the electrical conductivity changes depending on whether the alloy is of working or annealing finish, desired characteristics may be easily obtained. The grain forms are, in an alloy of rolling finish, relatively elongated and, in an alloy of annealing finish, relatively circular. The procedure for using the alloy of the present invention for electric wires and cables will now be described. As was described earlier, pure copper is defective in that it tends to break or stretch too much during the manufacturing procedure. In contrast to this, these defects are not noted with the alloy of the present invention. Therefore, this is especially preferable for use in a twisted form. Breakage and overstretching are related to the offset yield stress and formability into wire according to the present inventors. Thus, the alloy of the present invention is excellent in offset yield stress and formability into wire and is therefore especially suitable for use in electric wires and cables. When twisted wires are manufactured from this wire material, no noticeable breakage or stretching are observed and the grain forms are equivalent as those before twisting process. The characteristics of alloys with a grain size number of not less than 7 manufactured by repeated annealings and cold workings without requiring the solution treatment in accordance with the method of the present invention are shown in Table III. These alloys are an alloy A of 1 by weight of chrome and copper an alloy B of 0.15 by weight of zirconium and copper an alloy C of 0.7 by weight of chrome, 0.3 by weight of zirconium and copper an alloy D of 1t by weight of chrome, 0.03 by weight of silicon and copper an alloy E of 0.15 by weight of zirconium, 0.03 by weight of silicon and copper and an alloy F of 0.7 by weight of chrome, 0.15 by weight of zirconium, 0.03 by weight of silicon and copper. en germanium, boron and magnesium were used in place of silicon in each alloy D , E or F , almost the same results were obtained. Silicon, germanium, boron, magnesium and so on are effective for improving the mechanical strength and for suppressing the generation of coarse grains.

The electrically conductive copper alloy of the present invention may be applied in wide range including cables for welders, elevator cables, jumpers for vehicles, crane cables, trolly hard copper twisted wires of cable rack wires for power stations and substations, lead wires and so on. Although the above description has been made with reference to a chrome zirconium copper alloy, it is to be clearly understood that the above technique is applicable to other copper alloys which are conventionally known as materials for precipitation hardening materials.
