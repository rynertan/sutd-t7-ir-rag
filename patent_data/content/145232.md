# RETARDER FOR GRAVITY CONVEYOR

## Abstract
A retarder or brake mechanism 20 for controlling the velocity of articles on a gravity conveyor 10 has a pneuma tically operated actuator 44 . During each cycle of operation of the brake a charge of air of limited volume is supplied to the actuator, which has an air bleed 51 which limits the actuator s period of action during each cycle. The charge of air is supplied by an accumulator 45 , which is normally connected to a source of compressed air. An article actuated sensor 31, 31a and connected valve 30 , upon being tripped by an article, isolates the accumulator from its air supply and connects it to the actuator activating the actuator but limiting its air supply to the charge stored in the accumulator before the valve was shifted by the sensor. The charge, once exhausted, is not replenished until the sensor is released by the article.
