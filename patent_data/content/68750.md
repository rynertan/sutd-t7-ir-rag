# Improvements in longline baiting.

## Abstract
The improvements in longline fishing systems disclosed herein include improvements in the art of baiting longlines, im provements in a baiter and a bait cutting mechanism, improve ments in a fish hook and improvements in a magazine for sto ring hooks during baiting and longline shooting. The improve ment in the baiting method provides that the steps in the bai ting include the locating of adjacent hooks of a longline in a side by side laterally spaced relationship and the retaining of the hooks in a gang in a fixed position with respect to one an other and simultaneously hooking the gang of hooks into bait while the gang of hooks are retained in the fixed relationship. The improvement in the fish hook includes the provision of a body having a shank portion at one end thereof upon which a spacer is mounted. The spacer has at least one lateral projec tion extending therefrom whereby a plurality of hooks can be arranged in a side by side relationship with their head portions spaced by engagement of the projections of adjacent spacer means. The fish hook baiter comprises a hook support for sup porting a gang of hooks in a side by side spaced relationship, a bait support for supporting bait during hooking and guide means interconnecting the bait support and the hook support to permit relative movement therebetween along a baiting path whereby bait supported on the bait support is applied to each of the hooks in the gang of hooks. The fish hook storage maga zine in which the hooks may be supported for baiting and shooting comprises a frame which has a slipway opening in wardly from one end thereof. The slipway has upwardly and downwardly opening passages extending longitudinally in wardly from the one end and opposite sides of the slipway are adapted to slidably mount a fish hook for movement along the slipway whereby a plurality of fish hooks may be mounted on the slipway in a side by side sliding relationship.
