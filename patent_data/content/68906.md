## Description
A valve device for agitating the flurry in an glaerobic or aerobic digester FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a valve and more particularly to a valve for use in agitating and or mixing the working medium such as animal eXcreta, being broken down by bacterial decomposition, in aerobic and anaerobic digesters. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENT IONThere are many situations where it becomes necessary to agitate a mixture to maintain it in an homogeneous state.Thus the need to effect slurry agitation in aerobic and anaerobic digesters is due mainly to two factors, that, without it, first the bacteria tends to become inactive, and second the liquid separates from the solid making it difficult to remove from the slurry tank.Hence in an anaerobic digester, the slurry may be agitated by means of recirculation of compressed methane gas produced during the digestion process. However, with slurry tanks of large surface area either a very large compressor must be used for effective mixing, or the gas may be sequentially directed into the tank holding the slurry from a small compressor through a set of separate pipes. Thus a well known method of sequential mixing by compressed air or gas employs the use of a set of solenoid or pneumatic valves which are operated automatically to admit the air or gas in turn to the infeed pipes to the tank.It has been found however that such known methods for maintaining homogeneity of the contents of an anaerobic digester are cumbersome and expensive to operate and maintain. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt is an object of the present invention to provide simplification of the means for agitating the liquid of a tank particularly for agitating the slurry in an aerobic or anaerobic digester.According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a valve device for agitating slurry in an aerobic or anaerobic digester comprising first inner and second outer valve body parts 1,4 and characterised in that the valve body parts 1,4 are movable relative to one another, one of the valve body parts 1 being provided with spaced outlet ports 2 each for delivering compressed gas or air through mixing or aerating lines P to the slurry tank T of the digester, the other valve body part 4 constituting, or being provided with, delivery duct means 5,6 for sequential delivery of compressed gas or air from an external source G to said outlet ports 2 during said relative movement.The primary advantage of such a valve to its use in digesters of the type referred to, is that the fluid, normally a compressed gas or air, is always passing along one of the outlet ports so that one part or another of the slurry tank of the digester is always under the effect of aeration or agitation when the compressor, compressing the gas or air being fed into the valve, is running.Further the gas through the valve will take the path of least resistance and since the contents of the tank being mixed serve as a liquid seal for the outlet ports not in use, it is not absolutely necessary that there is a complete seal between successive ones of the outlet ports of the rotary valve Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the description that follows. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSAn embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the drawings wherein Figure 1 shows a cross sectional plan view of a rotary valve Figure 2 is a perspective view of the rotary valve Figure 3 is a perspective view of the inner rotatable cylinder of the rotary valve andFigure 4 is a schematic illustration of the use of the rotary valve to agitate the slurry tank of an anaerobic digester. BEST MODES OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTIONThe rotary valve shown generally referred to as V in the drawings, comprises an outer valve body part 1 in the form of a cylindrical tank, having peripherally spaced fluid outlet ports 2. In the present embodiment there are twelve such outlet ports 2 typically having a diameter of 25mm.A cylinder 4, constituting an inner valve body part, is mounted for rotation withing the valve body part 1. The cylinder 4 is caused to rotate by a geared electric motor fixed to the top of the cylindrical tank 1, as shown inFigure 2.The cylinder 4 is provided with a radially directed duct 5 leading from an axially positioned inlet duct 6 for connection to an outside source of compressed air or gas G, see Figure 4.The clearance C between the outer surface of the cylinder 4 and the inner surface of the outer cylindrical tank 1, is typically of the order of 1 2 mm.In use compressed gas or air enters the cylinder 4 via the duct 6. The gas or air then passes through the radially directed duct 5 and is delivered sequentially to the outlet ports 2 as the inner cylinder 4 rotates, and thence to the mixing or aeration pipes P leading to the slurry tank holding the liquid to be agitated, as will be seen fromFigure 4.As mentioned earlier, it is not essential that the inner cylinder 4 is a precision fit within the outer cylindrical tank 1. This is because a certain amount of pressure is required to force the compressed air or gas through each mixing or aeration pipe from the rotary valve, since the air or gas is acting against the head of liquid in the tank containing the mixture to be agitated. Thus air or gas escaping into the clearance C between the two revolving bodies will not have sufficient pressure to travel up the outlet ports except the one that is working at any particular time. The rotary valve according to an embodiment of the invention has been described, with reference to its application to anaerobic or aerobic digesters. However, it will be appreciated that the invention has wider fields of application, for example wherever it is desired to control the agitation and or mixing of the fluid contents of a vessel.
