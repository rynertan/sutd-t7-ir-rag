## Description
This invention relates to positive working or negative working resist compositions. Cationic photopolymerisation of vinyl and heterocyclic monomers, and photocrosslinking of polymers containing oxirane and thirane rings initiated by an acid generated via photolysis of onium salts are well known. U.S. patents 4,210,449 and 4,273,668 disclose the use of the onium salts as photoinitiators for cationic polymerization and crosslinking. U.S. patent 3,984,253 discloses a sensitization of polyphthalaldehyde to UV, electron beam, and X ray radiations by adding acid generating compounds such as diazonium salts to provide positive images. U.S. patent 4,311,782 discloses a radiation sensitive mixture which contains an acid forming compound and a polymeric compound having recurrent orthocarboxylic acid ester groupings for the production of positive relief images. U.S. patent 4,104,070 describes a Modified Image Reversal Process MIRP . The process, however, requires the addition of a third component and a flood exposure step. U.S. patent 4,101,323 discloses a radiation sensitive copying composition comprising a compound 1 which splits off an acid upon irradiation and a compound 2 having at least one group selected from the group consisting of a carboxylic ortho acid ester group and a carboxylic acid amide acetal group, which composition, upon irradiation, forms and exposure product having a higher solubility in a liquid developer than the non irradiated composition. U.S. patent 3,779,778 discloses a photosolubilizable composition comprising According to the invention there is provided a positive working and negative working resist composition comprising a polymer having recurrent acid labile pendant groups and a photoinitiator which generates an acid upon exposure to radiation characterised in that the acid labile pendant groups are tertiary butyl esters of carboxylic acids or tertiary butyl carbonates of phenols. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a resist composition as hereinbefore defined wherein the photoinitiator is taken from the group consisting of aryldiazonium salts, unsubstituted and symmetrically or unsymmetrically substituted diaryliodonium or triarylsulfonium salts. The resist compositions of the present invention which are sensitive to ultraviolet UV , electron beam or x ray radiation with positive or negative resist tone upon proper choice of a developer are made by combining a polymer having recurrent acid labile pendant groups with a cationic photoinitiators such as aryldiazonium, diaryliodonium, or triarylsulfonium metal halides. The polymer containing the initiator is coated as a thin film on a substrate. It is then baked under controlled conditions, exposed to radiation in an imagewise configuration, and postbaked under controlled conditions. In the portions of the films on which the radiation falls, the polymer recurrent acid labile pendant groups are cleaved to form polar recurring units and the exposed areas are selectively removed by treatment with an alkaline developer or polar solvents. Because the unexposed portions of the film are nonpolar, they are selectively removed by treatment with a nonpolar solvent. Thus, image reversal is extremely easily achieved by proper choice of a developer owing to the great difference in the solubility characteristics of the exposed and unexposed portions. The mechanism of the dissolution differentiation involved in the present invention completely differs from those of the prior art above. Whereas the prior art depends on crosslinking in the case of the negative tone or main chain degradation in the case of the positive tone, the present invention is concerned with the side chain cleavage. In a preferred variation of the present invention, the compositions employed are made sensitive to various wavelengths ranging from deep UV to visible light. For instance, the absorption maxima of aryldiazonium salts can be matched to the spectrum of the mercury lamp output by substitution on the aromatic ring. In addition, although the absorption of diaryliodonium and triarylsulfonium salts does not extend about 300 nm, simple addition of an additional sensitizer component allows patterning at longer wavelengths ranging from mid UV to visible light. Compositions covered under the present invention which contain recurring aromatic rings have another desirable property, namely, resistance to plasma and reactive ion etching. Compositions of the present invention containing diaryliodonium or triarylsulfonium metal halides are particularly useful and advantageous when used with deep UV light 200 300 nm exposure, because they are very sensitive to deep UV light and give very high resolution images with nearly vertical wall angles even in films thicker than 2µ. In the present invention, it is understood that any substance which produces strong acid upon exposure to radiation can be a photoinitiator. However, the most preferred photoinitiators are unsubstituted and symmetrically or unsymmetrically substituted diaryliodonium or triarylsulfonium salts. Triarylselenonium salts are also useful. Substituted aryldiazonium salts can be employed as well. The most preferable gegenanions of the salts in the present invention are complex metal halides such as tetrafluoroborate, hexafluoroantimonate, hexafluoroarsenate, and hexafluorophosphate, but the invention is not limited to these gegenanions and photoinitiators. It is operative with a wide range of compounds which generate acids upon exposure to radiation. In the prevent invention, the amount of initiator used ranges from 1 to 100 w w to polymer. The preferred concentration range is from 5 to 50 ww . The preferred polymers of the present invention are vinylic polymers containing recurrent pendant groups that undergo efficient acidolysis to produce products that are very different in polarity Solubility than their precursors. The invention, however, is not limited to polymers obtained by vinylic addition polymerization. Other polymerizations such as condensation, polyaddition, and addition condensation can be employed to synthesize polymers useful in the present invention. The acid labile pendant groups are tert butylesters of carboxylic acides and tert butylcarbonates of phenols. The most preferred polymers are poly p tert butoxycarbonyloxy α methylstyrene , poly p tert butoxycarbonyloxystyrene , poly tert butyl p vinylbenzoate , poly tert butyl p isopropenylphenyloxyacetate , and poly tert butyl methacrylate . The preferred compounds used with diaryliodonium or triarylsulfonium salts to sensitize the compositions to longer wavelengths ranging from mid UV to visible light are polycyclic aromatics such as pyrene and perylene. Other dyes are also available that are operative sensitizers including the acridines. The invention is not limited to the use of any particular class of dyes.
