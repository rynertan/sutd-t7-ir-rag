# Screen assembly and fastening element therefor.

## Abstract
A screen assembly includes at least one panel with slots 9 in its side edges, a plurality of upright poles 2 to which the panel is fastened and a plurality of fastening elements 4 . The fastening elements 4 and the panel are arranged such that a fort portion 6 of a fastening element can be inserted into one of the slots 9 and can then be rotated in the slot about an axis transverse to the slot, whereupon the foot portion 6 becomes progressively more securely clamped in the slot 9 and in a final position is locked to the panel. The fastening element is thus easily fixed to the panel and provides a very secure fixing when so fixed.
