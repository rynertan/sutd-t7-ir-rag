## Description
, method of manufacturing X ray sensitive phosphors, X ray phosphors and an X r intensif ing corcer using phosphors. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION The present invention relates to a method of producing X ray exicited phosphor, a phosphor which emits light under X ray excitation and an X ray intensifing screen using the phosphor, and relates mainly to an X ray intensifing screen used for medical and industrial radiography. An X ray excited phosphor is used mainly for X ray intensifing screen. This X ray intensifing screen is generally used in conjunction with photographic film for the Purpose of improving the sensitivity of the photographic system of the medical radiography. The phosphor used for such an X ray intensifing screen is requested to have a good X ray absorption, a high X ray to light conversion efficiency, and a small afterglow component. An X ray intensifing screen coated with phosphor of a goodX ray absorption has higher definition of X ray image and therefore can improve the diagnosis efficiency in the medical radiography. A phosphor having a h.19h X ray to light conversion efficiency can be used with only a little quantity of X ray irradiation, and thereby the exposure dose of the subject can be reduced. Further, a phosphor having a low quantity of afterglow component can Prevents errors in consultation caused by residue afterglow nolse . Recently, according to the request of reducing exposure dose of the subjects, X ray intensifing screens using a phosphor containing Gd2O2S Tb, BaFCl Eu, LaOBr Tm, YTaO4 Tm or the like, instead of conventional phosphor of CaWO4 have been Put to practical use. However, since BaFCl Eu and LaOBr Tm have low X ray absorption dose, the definition of the obtained X ray photograph is not good. Further, since the phosphor is shaped into flat granules, light emitted by the excitation of X ray is much scattered and the sharpness o f the X ray image becomes low. A phosphor containing Gd202S Tb emits light in the range from the blue zone to the green zone, and is used in combination with an orthochromatic film which is sensitive in the range from the blue zone to the green zone. Therefore, the film is easily exposed to light even in the darkroom and the darkroom lamp is required to be dim. which causes low workability. Rare earth tantalate phosphors exhibit undesirable delayed fluorescence afterglow , and afterglow noises occur when the phosphor screen is used in rapid succession for several films which limits the use purposes. If a phosphor is developed which has a small afterglow component and is provided with the advantages of rare earth tantalate phosphors. an ideal phosphor for X ray use can be realized. BRIEF SUMMARY OF INVENTION The inventors have studied in various ways on the phosphor containing rare earth tantalate and or rare earth niobate for the purpose of achieving the abovementioned object. As the result, we have succeeded in remarkably improving the afterglow characteristic of the phosphor by mixing a diadic metal and a n alkali metal to basic materials. before calcinating. Further, the obtained phosphor containing a diadic metal and an alkali metal has not only a remarkably improved afterglow characteristic but can also show remarkably improved X ray to light conversion efficiency. The phosphor produced by the method of the present invention is represented by the general formula 1 Ln1 x 2 3 y 1 3 ZM yM ZDO4 xR3 1 in this formula. M being at least one kind of diadic metal selected from the group consisting of Be, Mg. Ca, Sr, Ba, Zn andCd, M being at least one kind of alkali metal selected from the group consisting of Li, Na and K. Ln being at least one kind of element selected from the group consisting of Y, Gd, La and Lu, D containing either or both of Ta and Nb, and R being at least one selected from the group consisting of Tm. Pr, Sm, Eu, Tb. Dy, Yb or the matrix being self activating. If a large quantity of the diadic metal M is mixed in the basic material at producing process, the afterglow characteristic can be improved, but an excessive content thereof causes to lowerX ray to light conversion efficiency. The value y in the general formula indicating the content of the diadic metal M is determined as the desirable range 1x10 5 y 1 from the consideration of the afterglow characteristic andX ray to light conversion efficiency. Further, the value of z in the general formula indicating the content of the alkali metal M Is determined as the desirable range 1x10 4 Z 0.1 from the consideration of afterglow characteristic and X ray to light conversion effeciency. Further more, an excessive quantity of the activator Tm, Pr, Sm, Eu. Tb, Dy or Yb causes to lower the light emission efficiency. However, the phosphor according to the present invention can be used without any activator since the matrix itself can emit light.The value of x in the general formula I indicating the content of the activator is determined as 0 xS0.05 from the consideration of the light emission efficiency. In the X ray intensifing screen according to the present invention, the phosphor represented by the abovementioned general formula I is adhered in the dispersed state onto a support by means of a binding agent. An important object of the present invention is to provide a method and a phosphor which can emit light by the excitation ofX ray, can absorb a large quantity of X ray and has a high X ray to light conversion efficiency and a small afterglow component. Further. another important object of the present invention is to provide an X ray intensifing screen which affords to take a radiograph with only a small exposure dose of a subject and affords to make a correct diagnosis of the subject. The above and further objects and novel features of the invention will more fullY appear from the following detailed dcription when the same is read In connection with the accompanying drawing. It is to be expressly understood, however, that the drawing is for pourpose illustration only and is not intended as a definition of the limits of the invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present invention relates to a method of an X ray phosphor. an X ray phosphor and an X ray intensifing screen using the phosphor. Therefore, there will be described the method for producing an X ray intensifing screen using the phosphor according to the present invention and the method for producing the phosphor. The X ray intensifing screen mainly comprises a support and a phosphor layer provided on the support, the phosphor layer comprising a binding agent carrying the phosphor, the phosphor1 represented by the abovementioned general formula I in dispersed state. The phosphor layer is formed on the support in the following way as well known. Firstly, the phosphor represented by the abovementioned general formula I and an binding agent are added to a solvent and mixed together to Prepare a coating liquid in which particles of the phosphor are uniformly dispersed in the binding agent solution. As the binding agent for the phosphor layer, nitrocellulose, pblyalkyltmetha acrylate. linear polyester and their mixture can be used. As the solvent for preparing the coating liquid. esters of lower fatty acids and lower alcohols such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate. ketones such as asetone and methyl ethyl keton, ethers such as dioxane and ehylene glycol monoethul ether and their mixtures can be used. The mixture ratio of the binding agent and the phosphor in the coating liquid is varied in accordance with the characteristic of the X ray intensifing screen to be obtained or the particle size of the phosphor. but it is preferably selected in the range from 1 8 to 1 40 weight ratio . Further, additive agents may be mixed into the coating liquid. such as a disPersing agent for improving the dispersiblity of the phosphor particles and a plasticizer for improving the binding force between the binding agent and the phosphor particles. The coating is formed by uniformly coating the coating liquid prepared as abovementioned on the support with a conventional coating member such as a doctor blade, a roll coater, a knife coater or the like. After the coating is formed. the coating is dried whereby the formation of the phosphor layer on the support is completed. The thickness of the phosphor layer is varied with the characteristics of the intensifing screen to be obtained. the particle size of the phosphor and the mixture ratio of the binding agent and the phosphor1 but it is preferably selected usually in the range from 7film to 700 m. The phosphor layer may comprise one laYer or more than two layers. When more than two layers are laminated. at least one layer of them contains the phosphor represented by the general formula I . The material for making the support may be selected from many kind of conventional materials for the support of the X ray intensifing screen. Such examples are plastic films of cellulose acetate. polyester, polyamide, polycarbonate. metal sheets of aluminium foil or aluminium alloy foil, or pigment papers containing titanic dioxide or the like. When plastic films are used, a light absorptive material such as carbon black, or a light reflective material such as titanic dioxide may be blended thereinto. The former is suitable for an X ray intensifing screen of a high sharpness type while the latter is suitable for an X ray intensifing screen of a high sensitivity. Usually In an X ray intensifing screen, a transparent protective film for physically and chemically protecting the phosphor layer is provided on the surface of the phosphor layer oPposite to the contact surface with the support. Preferably, such a transparent protective film is provided in an X ray intensifing screen using the phosphor according to the present invention. The transparent protective film can be formed by dissolving a cellulose derivative such as cellulose acetate or nitrocellulose, or a transparent polymeric substance such as polymetyl methacrylate, polycarbonate or polyvinyl acetate into a suitable solvent to prepare a solution, and coating the solution on the surface of the phosphor layer. Otherwise, the transparent protective film can be formed by adhering a transparent thin film separately made of polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate or polyamide onto the surface of the phosphor layer with an adhesive agent. Now, examples of the method for Producing a phosphor according to the present invention in the following. However, these examples will not limit the present invention.Example 1 112.3g of yttrium oxide and 0.981g of thulium oxide were dissolved in 340ml of 10N hydrochloric acid. Pure water was added thereto to make 1000my of a solution. Then, the solution was heated to 80 degrees C with mixing, On the other hand, a water solution of oxalic acid obtained by dissolving 220g of oxalic acid into 1000ml of pure water was heated to 80 degrees C and added to the abovementioned 80 degrees C hydrochloric acid solution with mixing. Thus, In the solution, oxalate of yttrium and thulium was produced and precipitated together. The solution containing the precipitate was cooled in the air and then washed five times with water by decantatlon, and the precipitate was sucked and filtered.The precipitate was decomposed by heating at a temperature of 850 degrees C for 3 hours, whereby 113.2g of oxide of oxalate was obtained. Then 63.0g of thus obtained oxide of oxalate, 125g of tantalic penta oxide and 21g of calcium chloride were well mixed and put in an almina crucible and then calcinated at a temperature of 1000 degrees C for 15 hours. The calcinated substance was mixed with 62.5g of lithium chloride and 0.4g of boric acid and ground and blended together by a ball mill.
