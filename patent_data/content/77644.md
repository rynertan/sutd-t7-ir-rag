# Optical memory system providing improved track following.

## Abstract
A laser optical system including a reading beam for reading optical data recorded in one or more tracks of a rotating disk optical recording medium. The disk includes a plurality of preformatted headers spaced along the track wherein each header includes first and second track follow ing optical holes which are elongated in the direction of the track and disposed on opposite sides of the track center line in a staggered relationship along the track. Traversal of these track following holes by the reading beam produces a reflected beam which varies in a manner dependent upon the accuracy of positioning of the beam relative to the track center line. Up down integration circuitry responsive to this reflected beam is used to produce a track following signal which is applied to a radial position control motor for maintaining the beam precisely on the track center line.
