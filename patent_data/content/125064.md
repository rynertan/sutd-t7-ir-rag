# Method for detecting stress and defect in a metal piece.

## Abstract
A sensor for a system that detects stresses and defects in a metal piece by employing the Barkhausen phenomenon enables static or dynamic testing of such metal pieces as hard steel in which only low levels of Barkhausen noise can be generated or which are configured in one of a large variety of shapes. The sensor includes apparatus that ensures that a uniform time varying magnetic field can be produced in all the metal pieces of a variety of shapes. The sensor 10 can include an energizing coil assembly 14 which generates the magnetic field in the metal piece having a core constructed from such a material in which a low level of magnetic noise is generated as ferrite. The level of the magnetic noise gener ated in the ferrite core is so low that, even the magnetic noise is sensed by the sensing coil assembly 16 , which receives the Barkhausen noise generated within the metal piece, that noise cannot interfere with the higher levels of Barkhausen noise generated in all ferromagnetic metals, including hard steel. The dynamic sensor 200 has apparatus, such as wheel assemblies 256 , for maintaining an air gap of a substantially constant depth between the specimen and the energizing 236 and sensing 248 cores. The dynamic sensor 300 can also include an energizing core of an energizing coil assembly 310 and which can be reoriented relative to the sensor 300 to determine the directional characteristics of stress and defects in the specimen.
