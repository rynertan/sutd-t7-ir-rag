## Description
ROTATABLY MOUNTED MEMBERThis invention relates to a member which is mounted on a support structure so as to be rotatable relative thereto through a plurality of predetermined stopping positions. The invention is more particularly although not exclusively, concerned with such a rotatably mounted member which is a reel assembly of a gaming type entertainment machine of the kind known as a fruit machine, that is a rotatably mounted member in which the member is a drum or disc which in use is provided with a plurality of symbols, such as fruit, around the periphery thereof and can be rotated for a period of time and then brought to rest at one of say 20 stopping positions thereof to display in such stopping position one or more of said symbols.A fruit machine usually has three or four such reel assemblies and in use, during play of a game, the drums or discs may rotate for different random periods of time and display when stopped a randomly selected combination of symbols. With this arrangement, for rotating the different discs or drums it is known to connect the discs or drums via slipping clutches to the drive shaft of a common electric motor. The drums or discs have teeth around the periphery of same and stopping of each disc or drum in precise registration with one of the 20 stopping positions thereof is effected by means of a respective solenoid operated indexing device which moves an arresting pawl into engagement with the teeth. With this known arrangement, the requisite clutch arrangement and motor drive is particularly complex and expensive to manufacture.Also, and particularly having regard to the interconnection of the different discs and drums via the common drive arrangement, repair and maintenance work and replacement of component parts can be different or inconvenient.It is also known to use an arrangement of independently rotatable drums or discs with a respective drive device for each such drum or disc comprising a solenoid operated pawl mechanism engageable with teeth on the periphery of the drum or disc. Each drum or disc is set in motion by pulling the respective pawl sharply away from the teeth so that a tangential impulse is applied to the drum or discs and stopping of the drum or disc is effected by release of the pawl such that it moves back into arresting engagement with the teeth in like manner to the above described indexing device . With this arrangement, however, the solenoids apply large thrusts to the drums or discs which may cause undue WEd r 5 rota wrings or mountings thereof.Also, the solenoids require a high operating current and any fluctuation in the power supply may introduce an element of uncertainty into the operation of the solenoid drive.Such uncertainty may be particularly undesirable in a fruit machine having a nudge facility, that is, in which a control is provided for causing a stationary disc or drum to advance from one stopping position to the next successive stopping position.An object of the present invention is to provide an improved drive means for a rotatably mounted member.According to the invention therefore there is provided a rotatably mounted member comprising a member which is mounted on a support structure so as to be rotatable relative thereto through a plurality of predetermined stopping positions, an electrical drive motor being provided for effecting said rotation of the member, and indexing means being provided for stopping the member in one of said stopping positions thereof, characterised in that said drive motor is an integral part of the rotatably mounted member.With this arrangement, due to incorporation of the motor in the rotatably mounted member it will be appre iated that it is possible to achieve a smooth, even drive with low power consumption, yet maintenance and manufacture can be much simplified in so far as the rotatably mounted member incorporating the drive means can represent an independent unit which does not require the use of clutches or other drive transmission devices to connect same to other rotatably mounted members or to a separate drive source.Most preferably, and in order to achieve optimum simplicity and reliability of construction, the motor is direct coupled to the member, that is, without the intermediary of any geared drive connection or other drive modifying coupling and also, the motor may be incorporated directly in the rotatably mounted member, that is, such that the motor is not a separately housed and mounted unit but utilises structural parts of the rotatably mounted member as structural parts of the motor. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the motor has a rotor and a stator, one of the rotor and stator being mounted on or forming part of the said support structure, and the other of said rotor and stator being secured to or forming part of the said member.The motor may be of any suitable mode of operation.Preferably however the motor is a rotary linear motor, that is a motor having a metal rotor in the form of a disc or cylinder and a fixed coil structure which is positioned alongside a surface of the rotor and in use generates a magnetic field moving in the plane of such surface.With regard to the said indexing means, this may take any suitable form and thus for example may comprise an indexing device of the known kind hereinbefore described having a solenoid operated pawl engageable with teeth around the periphery of the member. Such teeth may be provided on the member itself or may be on a disc or other structure connected to the member so as to be rotatable therewith, which disc or other structure may constitute the rotor of the motor. Instead of using such indexing device, however, it is possible to provide a pawl which is positioned to engage teeth around the member, which pawl permits rotation of the member in a. forward direction but prevents movement in a reverse direction, and the member is urged in the rearward direction on stopping thereof.Thus, the teeth may be ratchet teeth and urging the member in the reverse direction of rotation may be effected by a mechanical device such as spring means or may involve reverse energisation of the motor.The rotatably mounted member of the invention may be used for any suitable purpose but is most preferably used as a reel assembly in an entertainment machine especially a fruit machine as hereinbefore described.With such a reel assembly it is necessary to provide machine interpretable information as to the position of the member when stopped in order that it can be determined, using an appropriate evaluation system, as to whether or not the displayed symbols of a plurality of such reel assemblies define a winning combination. This may be effected using light sensors and light sources for reading coded light transmitting regions such as holes or reflective portions on the members of the reel assemblies for example in the manner described inBritish Patent No. 1,368,622 and pending BritishApplications Nos. 7968 76 and 8506 77. The code reading systems as specifically described in such Patent andApplications may use, for each member, a single light source and a bank of light sensors, whereby a particular combination of sensors are simultaneously illuminated for each stopping position. If desired however a code reading system may be used which involves a bank of light sources and a single sensor, the light sources being activated serially at each stopping position whereby the sensor is energised serially in a particular pattern dependent on the particular combination of light sources capable of transmitting light to the sensor at the stopping position.The invention will now be described further by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic perspective view of a fruit machine incorporating rotatably mounted members according to one form of the invention which are reel assemblies of the machine Fig. 2 is a diagrammatic sectional view of one of the reel assemblies Fig. 3 is a diagrammatic elevational view of the reel assembly of Fig. 2 with parts omitted for the sake of clarity Fig. 4 is a view corresponding to Fig. 3 of part of a modified version of the reel assembly Fig. 5 is a circuit diagram of the fruit machine.The reel assembly of Figs. 2 and 3 comprises a drum 7 which may be formed from plastics material and has one circular end wall 2 and a cylindrical peripheral wall 3. The drum 1 is secred to an axially extending shaft 4 and such shaft 4 is rotatably mounted on and retained axially relative to a support structure 5. This structure 5 may be in the form of a rigid metal plate extending parallel to the wall 2 of the drum 1. Within the drum 1, a metal disc 6 is fixed on the shaft 4 and extends parallel to the end wall 2. The disc 6 as shown in Fig.3 has 20 V shaped teeth 7 cut at regular intervals roland its entire periphery, 20 V shaped cut outs 8 being defined between the teeth 7. An electromagnetic indexing device 9 is mounted on the support structure 5 and this device has a solenoid operated catch finger 10 which is normally spaced from the teeth 7 so as to permit free rotation of the disc 6 but which can be moved forwards, on actuation of the solenoid of the device 9, to engage a cut out 8 between two teeth 7 and thereby prevent rotation of the disc 6.A coil arrangement 11 is also mounted on the support structure 5 adjacent the disc 6. The coil arrangement 11 comprises two separate coils 12, 13 spaced in the circumferential direction of the disc and each having a respective metal core straddling the disc. A capacitor not shown is connected to one coil so that, on a.c.energisation of the coils, there is a phase difference between the currents flowing in the two coils and the resulting side by side out of phase magnetic fluxes give the effect of a magnetic field which moves tangentially or circumferentially in the plane of the disc 6 whereby the disc 6 and coil arrangement 11 define a rotary linear motor. The disc 6 is urged in one particular direction. By reversing the connection of one coil, the direction of rotation of the disc 6 can be reversed. A permanent magnet 19 is also mounted on the structure 5 alongside the disc 6. One pole of the magnet faces the disc and the other pole is exposed to the opposite face of the disc 6 via a metal stirrup 20 straddling the disc.Rotation of the disc gives rise to induction of eddy currents therein due to the action of the magnet and the resulting magnetic field interacts with the magnetic field of the magnet to resist rotation of the disc.The drum 1 has symbols at 20 positions around the outer surface of the cylindrical wall 3 and a plurality say three or four of like reel assemblies are mounted on a support framework not shown in axial alignment behind a window 14 in a fruit machine housing as shown in Fig. 1 so that, when the drums 1 are at rest, at least one symbol as shown 3 symbols from each drum 1 are displayed through the window 14. The fruit machine also has a slot 15 leading to a coin or token mechanism operating controls 16, a pay out aperture 17, and a front display area 18 incorporating display lamps not shown . The reel assemblies and also the coin or token mechanism, the controls 16, the display lamps, and other devices and mechanisms such as pay out solenoids, the device 9, the coil arrangement 11 and a position detection system yet to be described are connected to control circuitry described hereinafter with reference to Fig. 5. In use, after insertion of one or more coins or tokens into the slot 15 to actuate the machine, a player can energise the coil arrangements 11 of the different reel assemblies, by operating the appropriate control 16, to cause the discs and hence the drums 1 to rotate in a predetermined forward direction.After a different random period of time for each reel assembly, forward energisation of the coil arrangement 11 ceases, the solenoid of the device 9 is actuated to cause the finger 10 to engage the teeth 7 and the disc 6 is thereby stopped, the precise interengagement of the finger 10 and one of the 20 cut outs 8 ensuring that the drum is stopped in precise registration with one of the 20 predetermined stopping positions thereof.With this arrangement, it will be appreciated that a smooth, even drive of the drum 1 is achieved with a motor which has only small power consumption. The rotatable mounting for the drum 1 can therefore give reliable operation with a long working life even with a simple, inexpensive construction since it does not have to withstand large uneven forces.Also, it will be seen that each reel assembly including the drive for the drum 1 constitutes a structural unit of simple form and which is separate from the other reel assemblies in the fruit machine. Thus the reel assembly can be manufactured and installed in a simple convenient and inexpensive manner and subsequently maintenance or repair work can be readily effected by removing the entire unit and if necessary replacing same with a new unit.The provision of the magnet 19 ensures that the maximum rate of rotation of the drum 1 is kept tQ the level usual in fruit machines say one or two revolutions per second whilst at the same time applying little restriction to the initial rate of acceleration of the drum at the start of rotation of same. De energisation of the coil arrangement 11 is arranged to take place slightly before actuation of the indexing device 9, and in order to ensure easy engagement of the finger 10 with a cut out 8, the actuation of the device 9 may be effected under the control of a detection device as described below which detects the positioning of the cut outs 8 relative to the finger. On stopping of the drums 1, a nudge facility may be made available on a regular or irregular random basis.In this case, when the player operates an appropriate one of the controls 16, one or more of the drums is stepped in the forward or reverse direction of rotation through one stopping position. In the case of reverse stepping, reversal of the direction of rotation is achieved with the coil arrangement 11 as described above.The use of the above mentioned detection device to control the indexing device 9 is particularly helpful in ensuring that the drum does not overshoot during stepping.Identification of the stopping positions of the drum 1 of each reel assembly can be effected using a code reading position detection system comprising a bank of five light sources say LEDs 21 mounted on one arm of a stirrup 22 which is fixed to the support structure 5 so that the light sources extend within the drum 1 on one side of the disc 6, and a bank of light sensors 23 such as photo transistors which are mounted on an opposite arm of the stirrup on the opposite side of the disc 6. The light sources are aligned respectively with the sensors. The disc 6 is provided with a particular arrangement of one or more holes at each of 20 positions around same such that one such arrangement is positioned between the light sources and the sensors in each stopping position so that light can be transmitted from a particular combination of the light sources through the holes to the sensors.As can be seen from Fig. 3, each arrangement of holes only two of which 24, 25 are shown comprises a radially extending row of a maximum of five thereof, and the holes are positioned at appropriate ones of five different regularly spaced circumferential portions of the disc. The light sources and sensors are correspondingly arranged.The coded arrangements of holes may be such that there is a different co mbination for each of the 20 stopping positions, or alternatively such that there is a different combination for each different kind of symbol applied to the periphery of the drum each symbol appearing more than once around the drum . Adjacent each arrangement of holes for each stopping position there is a single hole 26, and mounted on the stirrup there is a further light source and a further sensor on opposite sides of the disc 6. As the disc rotates, the holes 26 pass between such further light source and sensor permitting transmission of light therebetween.The holes 26 and associated light source and sensor constitute the aforementioned detection device which provides information with regard to the positioning of the cut outs 8 to ensure that actuation of the indexing device 9 occurs at the appropriate time.With the radial arrangement of the holes 24, 25 and of the corresponding light sources 21 and sensors 23, it will be appreciated that all holes are presented simultaneously for code reading purposes. Thus, code reading can be achieved whilst the drums are rotating and accordingly it is possible to determine in advance the identity of a symbol corresponding to a particular stopping position before action is taken to stop the drum at such position.With reference to Fig. 5, it will be seen that the electronic control circuitry of the machine utilises a central processing unit such as a microprocessor MPU which has connected thereto appropriate processor power suppl and auxiliary control devices 27, memory devices 28 and an input output interface device o, The interface device is connected to input devices 29 such as the controls 16 and the coin mechanism, and to output devices such as pay out solenoids, indicator lamps and the like. The device i o is also connected to the light sources 30 and light sensors of the different reel assemblies.For a further description of suitable electronic circuitry reference is made to British Patent No. 1,545,301.It is of course to be understood that the invention is not intended to be restricted to the details of the above embodiment which are described by way of example only.Thus, for example, and as shown in Fig. 4, in place of the indexing device 9 and teeth 7, it is possible use a disc 6 which has 20 ratchet teeth 32 which are engaged by a springy pawl 33 mounted in a block 34 fixed to the support structure 5. The pawl 33 slides over the teeth 32 to permit rotation of the disc 6 in the forward direction thereof but catches against the teeth 32 to prevent rotation of the disc 6 in the reverse direction.In order to stop the disc 6 after a period of forward rotation thereof the energisation of the coil arrangement 11 is changed such as to drive the disc in the reverse direction of rotation. The disc is then arrested in precise registration with a stopping position by engagement of the pawl 33 with one tooth 32. Appropriate circuitry may be provided to ensure that the power feed to the coil arrangement is much less in the reverse direction than in the forward direction. Alternatively, the reverse power feed may be maintained the same as the forward power feed in order to give a sharp indexing action.If desired, an appropriate mechanism may lift the pawl 33 away from the teeth 32 during forward rotation of the disc 6. Such mechanism may also be utilised in the case where the reverse nudge facility reverse stepping is to be made available.Further, with the above described position identifying system, instead of using six sensors and light sources to read the position coding holes 24, 25 and the auxiliary holes 26, it is possible to use only five sensors light sources, the outermost such sensor light source being used to read both kinds of holes.As an alternattive to the above described position identifying system, it is possible to provide a coded cluster of holes on the disc 6 for each stopping position, and, on stopping of the disc, these may be read with a single sensor on one side of the disc and a cluster of five light sources at the opposite side of the disc. The light sources are energised successively so that a serial code of impulses is produced by the sensor dependent on the presence or absence of holes aligned with the respective light sources. The reverse arrangement i.e. five sensors and a single light source could also be used.The above described indexing device 9 is preferably such that on actuation thereof the finger 10 is urged for example by a spring into engagement with the teeth 7 and deactuation is effected by energising the solenoid to hold the finger 10 away from the teeth 7, although of course if desired a reverse arrangement may be utilised. Also, the drum 1 and the disc 6 need not be mounted on the rotatable spindle 4, but instead the drum and disc may be secured to a boss which is rotatably mounted on a spindle which is nonrotatably fixed to the plate 5. Further, in an alternative more compact arrangement, the coils 12, 13 and the magnet 19 are on the other side of the disz 6 so to lie within the confines of the drum 1. Further, the coil arrangement 11 may have three separate coils disposed adjacent the disc 6, namely two outer coils which are substantially identically wound coils of opposite hand interconnected via a tuning capacitor to give a singly tuned pair, and a central coil which is predominantly inductive, whereby the magnetic fluxes of the two outer coils are anti phase to each other 1800 apart and the phase of the magnetic flux of the central coil lies between the outer coils spaced by 900 from each coil . With this arrangement the pair of singly tuned outer coils are balanced magnetically about the single central coil so that reversal of mutual inductance due to reversal of the central coil or reversal of the outer coils cannot detune the coil pair. Thus, even in a system with high 5. mutual inductance it is possible to achieve equal torque in opposite driving directions with a simple and efficient arrangement.
