# Process for the carbonylation of alkanols and or ethers.

## Abstract
Process for the carbonylation of alkanols and or ethers at elevated temperature and pressure in the presence of a Group VII metal compound and pentachlorobenzenethiol and or salts thereof, using a pentachlorobenzenethiol com pound Group VIII metal compound molar ratio or not more than 10. The process is of special interest for the production of methyl acetate from methanol using an active, iodine free catalytic system.
