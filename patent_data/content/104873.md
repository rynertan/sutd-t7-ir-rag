# A PROCESS FOR HYDROXYLATING OLEFINS USING AN OSMIUM CARBONYL CATALYST

## Abstract
A process for hydroxylating olefins, such as ethylene or propylene, using an oxidant selected from organic hydroper oxides, H₂O₂, and oxygen and a catalyst composition comprising at least one osmium carbonyl catalyst, such as Os₃ CO ₁₂, and optionally at least one co catalyst such as NaI, is disclosed.
