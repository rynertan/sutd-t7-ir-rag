## Description
Field of the Invention This invention relates to the preparation of human IGF insulin like growth factor , in various forms, via recombinant DNA technology. Notably, the present invention provides for the preparation of human IGF as a mature protein product of expression, processing, and secretion in a recombinant DNA modified host organism. This invention thus provides for the production, isolation, and use of human IGF, in its various forms, as well as to the associated recombinant DNA technology by which it is prepared.In addition, the present invention relates to the similar preparation of a related protein, human EGF Epidermal GrowthFactor . The present invention arises in part from the discovery of a novel system by which human IGF can be prepared by a recombinant host organism in the form of a discrete, mature protein. This is accomplished according to one aspect of the present invention by an expression system which permits the expression of the amino acid sequence of human IGF fused with at least a portion of the yeast alpha factor signal sequence, followed by processing of said signal sequence, and secretion of mature human IGF protein into the medium supporting the host organism. Thus, this novel aspect of the present invention, it is believed for the first time, permits the preparation, isolation, and utilization of human IGF as a discrete, mature protein.The present invention, in its broad compass, however, covers the preparation of the amino acid sequence of humanIGF in other recombinant systems including bacteria and cell culture and includes, therefore, the expression of human IGF DNA sequences providing not only mature human IGF but also fusion product derivatives containing the amino acid sequence of IGF as the essential component. All such products have been found to be biologically active, hence useful as intended. The publications and other materials hereof used to illuminate the background of the invention, and in particular cases, to provide additional details concerning its practice are incorporated herein by this reference and for convenience, are alphabetically and numerically referenced in the following text and respectively grouped in the appended bibliography.Background of the Invention A. Human IGF Insulin like Growth Factor Human IGF has been the subject of a fair amount of intensive study by past zçorkers. A body of literature has been developed related to various aspects of this protein r strives of proteins see references A through L . Insulin like growth factors I and II have been isolated from human serum A . The designation insulin like growth factor orIGF was chosen to express the insulin like effects and the insulin like structure of these polypeptides which act as mitogens on a number of cells. The complete amino acid sequences of IGF I and IGF II have been determined D,E . They are both single chain polypeptides with three disuiphide bridges and a sequence identity of 49 and 47 percent respectively, to human insulin A and B chains.The connecting peptide or C region is considerably shorter than the one of proinsulin and does not show any significant homology to it. For a summary of earlier studies on the biological efforts of IGF, see Reference F . IFG I and IGF II are growth promoting polypeptides occuring in human serum and human cerebral spinal fluid. Their structure is homologous to proinsulin. IGF I seems to be produced by the liver alon with a specific IGF binding protein both of which are under control of growth hormone. Thus, human IGF is considered to be an active growth pronoting molecule that medi ates the effect of human growth hormone. It was perceived that the application of recombinant DNA and associated technologies would be a most effective way of providing the requisite large quantities of high quality human iGF for applied use to human beings as a growth factor. The goal was to produce human IGF either as biologically active fusion protein, or more importantly, as a mature protein, as products of recombinant DNA technology from a host organism. Such materials would exhibit bioactivity admitting of their use clinically in the treatment of various growth affected conditions. 8. Recombinant DNA technology Recombinant DNA tec.lnology ilas reacted the age of some sophistication. molecular biologists are able to recombine various O JA sequences Witil some fdcility, creating new DNA entities capable of producing copious amounts of exogenous protein product in transformed microbes and cell cultures. The general means and methods are in hand for the in vitro ligation of various blunt ended or sticky ended fragments of DNA, producing portent expression vehicles useful in transforming particular organisms, thus directing their efficient synthesis of desired exogenous product.However, on an individual product basis, the pathway remains somewhat tortuous and the science has not advanced to a stage where regular predictions of success can be made. Indeed, those who portend successful results without the underlying experimental basis, do so with considerable risk of inoperability. DNA recombination of the essential elements, i.e., an origin of replication, one or more phenotypic selection characteristics, an expression promoter, heterologous gene insert and remainder vector, generally is perfonned outside the host cell. The resulting recombinant replicable expression vehicle, or plasmid, is introduced into cells by transformation and large quantities of the recombinant vehicle obtained by growing the transfonnant. Where the gene is properly inserted with reference to portions which govern the transcription and translation of the encoded DNA message, the resulting expression vehicle is useful to actually produce the polypeptide sequence for which the inserted gene codes, a process referred to as expression.The resulting product may be obtained by using, if necessary, the host cell, in microbial systems, and recovering the product by appropriate purification fran other proteins. In practice, the use of recombinant DNA technology can express entirely heterol ogous polypeptides so called direct expression or alternatively may express a heterologous polypeptide fused to a portion of the amino acid sequence of a honologous polypeptide. In the latter cases, the intended bioactive product is sometimes rendered bioinactive within the fused, homologous heterologous polypeptide until it is cleaved in an extracellular environment.See references M and . Similarly, the art of cell or tissue cultures for studying genetics and cell physiology is well established. Means and methods are in hand for maintaining pernanent cell lines, prepared by successive serial transfers from isolate normal cells For use in research, such cell lines are maintained on a solid support in liquid medium, or by growth in suspension containing support nutriments. Scale up for large preparations seems to pose only mechanical problems. For further background, attention is directed to references 0 and Pl. Likewise, protein biochemistry is R useful, indeed necessary, adjunct in biotechnology. Cells producing the desired protein also produce hundreds of other proteins, endogenous products of the cell s metabolism. These contaminating proteins, as well as other compounds, if not removed from the desired protein, could prove toxic if administered to an animal or human in the course of therapeutic treatment ith desired protein. Hence, the techniques of protein biochemistry come to bear, allowing the design of separation procedures suitable for the particular system under consideration and providing a homogeneous product safe for intended use.Protein biochemistry also proves the identity of the desired product, characterizing it and ensuring that the cells have produced it faithfully with no alterations or mutations. This branch of science is also involved in the design of bioassays, stability studies and other procedures necessary to apply before successful clinical studies and marketing can take place. Summary by the Invention The present invention is based upon the discovery that recombinant DNA technology can be used successfully to produce humanIGF and related protein, human EGF, preferably in direct form and in amounts sufficient to initiate and conduct animal and clinical testing as prerequisites to market approval. The products human IGF and EGF are suitable for use in all of their fonns as produced according to the present invention, viz. in the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of human beings fo r various growth associated conditions or diseases.Accordingly, the present invention, in one important aspect, is directed to methods of treating growth conditions in human subjects using human IGF or human EGF, and suitable phannaceutical compositions thereof, prepared in accordance with the methods dnd means of the present invention. The present invention further comprises essentially pure, mature human IGF, as a product of expression, processing, and secretion in a recombinant host organism. Such human IGF is free from association with i terminus amino acid sequence derivable frow the expression systems that can be employed to prepare the material.Thus, while the present invention is directed to the preparation of polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of IGF, a notable aspect of the present invention involves the production of the mature human IGF directly into the medium of the recombinant host organism employed. The present invention is also directed to replicable DNA expression vehicles harboring gene sequences encoding human IGF and human EGF in expressible form, to microorganism strains or cell cultures transformed with such vehicles and to microbial or cell cultures of such transfornants capable of produciny amino acid sequences of human IGF and human EGF.In still further aspects, the present invention is directed to various processes useful for preparing said genes sequences, DNA expression vehicles, microorganisms and cell cultures and specific embodiments thereof. Still further, this invention is directed to the preparation of fermentation cultures of said microorganisms and cell cultures.Brief Description of the drawings Figure 1 represents the chemically synthesized DNA strands used in the construction of expression vectors for human IGF.

Definitions As used herein1 human IGF and human EGF denotes human insulin like growth factor and human epidermal growth factor, produced by microoial or cell cultures systems and bioactive forms comprising the amino acid sequence corresponding to human IGF and human EGF otheririse native to human tissue. The human IGF and EGF proteins produced herein tiave been defined by means of DNA, gene, arid deductive amino acid sequencing.It will be unders tood that inasmuch as natural allelic variations exist and occur from individual to individual, as demonstrated by an amino acid difference s in the overall sequence or by deletions, substitutions, insertions, inversions, or additions of one or more amino acids of said sequences, the present invention is intended to embrace of all such allelic variations of the two molecules involved. In addition, the location of and the degree of glycosylation depends upon the nature of the recombinant host organism employed and such variations as may occur are included within the ambit of tilis invention.Finally, tile potentil exists in the use of DNA technology for the preparation of various derivatives of human IGF and human EGF by simple modification of the underlying gene sequence for sucn molecules. Such modifications could be accomplished by means of site directed mutagenesis of the underlying DNA, as an example. All such modifications resulting in derivatives of human IGF and human EGF are included within the scope of the present invention so long as the essential characteristic human IGF and human EGF activities remain unaffected in kind. Essentially pure form when used to describe the state of humanIGF or human EGF produced by this invention means that the proteins are free of proteins or other materials normally associated with human IGF or human EGF when produced by non recombinant cells, i.e.in their native environments. Expression vector includes vectors whicn are capable of expressing DNA sequences contained therein, where such sequences are operably linked to other sequences capable of effecting their expression, i.e., promotor operator sequences. In sum, expression vector is given a functional definition any DNA sequence which is capable of effecting expression of a specified DNA code disposed therein.In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinantDNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids which refer to circular double stranded DNA loops which in their vector fonn, are not bound to the cnromosone. In the present specification, plasmid , and vector are used interchangably as the plasmid is the most commonly used foril of vector. However, tne invention is intended to include such other fonns of expression vectors whicn function equivalently and which become known in the art subsequently. Recombinant host cells refers to cells which have been transformed with such vectors. Thus, the human IGF and human EGF molecules produced by such cells can be referred to as recombinant human I6F11 and recombinant human EGr . B. Host Cell Cultures and Vectors The vectors and methods disclosed herein are suitable for use in host cells over a wide range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In yeneral, of course, prokaryotes are preferred for cloning of D04A sequences in constructing the vectors useful in the invention.For example, E. coli K12 strain 294 ATCC No. 31446 is particularly useful. Other microbial strains which may be used include E. coli strains such as E. coli B, and E. coli X1776 ATTC No. 31537 . The aforementioned strains, as well as E. coli W3110 F, x prototrophic, ATTC No. 27325 , bacilli such as Bacillus subtilus, and other enterobacteriaceae such as Salmonella typhimurium orSerratia marcesans, and various pseudomonas species may be used.These examples are, of course, intended to be illustrative rather than limiting. In general, plasmid vectors containing replicon and control sequences which dre derived from species compatible with the host cell are used in connection with these hosts. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site, as well as marking sequences which are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. For example, E. coli is typically transformed using pBR 322, a plasmid derived from an t. coli species Bolivar, et al., Gene 2 95 1977 . pBR322 contains genes for ampicillin and tetracycline resistance and tnus provides easy means for identifying transformed cells.The pBR322 plasmid, or other microbial plasmid must also contain, or be modified to contain, promoters which can De used by the microbial organism for expression of its own proteins. Those promoters most commonly used in recombinant D construction include the s lactamase penicillinase and lactose promoter systems Chang et al, Mature, 275 615 1978 , Itakura, et al, Science, 198 1056 1977 Goeddel, et al Mature 281 544 1979 and a tryptophan trp promoter systems Goeddel, et al, Nucleic Acids Res., 8 4057 1980 EPO Appl Publ Mo. 0036776 . While these are the most commonly used, other microbial promoters have been discovered and utilized, and details concerning their nucleotide sequences have been published, enabling a skilled worker to ligate them functionally with plasmid vectors Siebenlist, et al, Cell 20 269 1980 . In addition to prokaryates, eukaryotic microbes, such as yeast cultures may also be used. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or common bakers yeast is the most commonly used among eukaryotic microorganisms, although d number of other strains are commonly available. For expression in Saccharomyces, the plasmid YRp7, for example, Stinchcomb, et al, Mature, 282 39 1979 Kingsman et al,Gene, 7 141 1979 Tschemper, et al, Gene, 10 157 1980 is commonly used.This plasmid already contains the trpl gene which provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan, for example ATCC tlo. 44076 or PEP4 1 Jones, Genetics, 8D 12 1977 . The presence of the trpl lesion as d characteristic of the yeast host cell genome then provides an effective environment for detectiny transformation by growth in the absence of tryptophan. Suitable proinoting sequences in yeast vectors include the promoters for 3 phosphoglycerate kinase Hitzeman, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 255 2073 1980 or other glycolytic enzymes Hess, et al,J. Adv. Enzyme Reg., 7 143 1968 Holland, et al, Biochemistry, 17 4900 1978 , such as enolase, glyceraldeiiyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokindse, pyruvate decarboxyldse, phosphofructokinase, glucose 5 phosphate isomerase, 3 phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucokinase. In constructing suitable expression pldsmids, the termination sequences associated with these genes are also ligated into the expression vector 3 of the sequence desired to be expressed to provide polyadenylation of the mRNA and termination. Other promoters, which have the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions are the promoter regions for alcohol dehydrogenase 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism, and the aforementioned glyceraldehyde 3phosphate dehydrogenase, and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization Holland, ibid. . Any plasmid vector containing yeast compatible promoter, origin of replication and termination sequences is suitable. In addition to microorganisms, cultures of cells derived from multicellular organisms may also be used as hosts. In principle, any such cell culture is workable, whether from vertebrate or invertebrate culture. However interest has been greatest in vertebrate cells, and propogation of vertebrate cells in culture tissue culture has become a routine procedure in recent years Tissue Culture, Academic Press, Kruse and Patterson, editors 1973 j. Examples of such useful host cell lines are VERO and HeLa cells, Chinese hamster ovary CHO cell lines, and W138, BHK, COS 7 and MDCK cell lines.Expression vectors for such cells ordinarily include if necessary an origin of replication, a promoter located in front of the gene to be expressed, along ith any necessary noosome binding sites, RMA splice sites, polyadenylation site, and transcriptional terminator sequences. For use in mammalian cells, the control functions on the expression vectors are often provided by viral material. For example, commonly used promoters are derived from polyoma,Adenovirus 2, and most frequently Simian Virus 40 SV4O . The early and late promoters of SV40 virus are particularly useful because both are obtained easily from the virus as a fragment which also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication Fiers, et al, Nature, 273 113 1978 incorporated herein by reference. Smaller or larger SV4O fragments may also be used, provided there is included the approximately 250 bp sequence extending from the Hind III site toward the Bgl I site located in the viral origin of replication.Further, it is also possible, and often desirable, to utilize promoter or control sequences normally associated it the desired gene sequence, provide such control sequences are compatible with the host cell systems. An origin of replication may be provided either by construction of the vector to include an exogenous origin, such as may be derived from SV40 or other viral e.g. Polyoms, Adeno, VSV, BPV, etc. source, or may be provided by the host cell chroi0osomal replication mechanism. If the vector is integrated into the host cell chromosome, the latter is often sufficient.C. Methods Employed If cells without formidable cell wall barriers are used as host cells, transfection is carried out by the calcium phosphate precipitation method ds described by Graham and Van der Eb,Virology, 52 545 1978 . However, other methods for introducingDNA into cells such as by nuclear injection or by protoplast fusion may also be used. If prokaryotic cells or cells which contain substantial cell wall constructions are used, the preferred method of transfection is calcium treatment using calcium chloride as described by Cohen, F.N.et al Proc. Natal. Acad. Sci. USA , 69 2110 1972 . Construction of suitable vectors containing the desired coding and control sequences employ standard ligation techniques. Isolated plasmids or DNA fragments are cleaved, tailored, and religated in the form desired to form the plasmids required. Cleavage is performed by treating with restriction enzyme or enyzmes in suitable buffer. In general, about 1 g plasmid or DNA fragments is used with about 1 unit of enzyme in about 20 l of buffer solution. Appropriate buffers and substrate amounts for particular restriction enzymes are specified by the manufacturer. Incubation times of about 1 hour at 37 C are workable. After incubations, protein is removed by extraction .litfl phenol and chloroform, and the nucleic acid is recovered from the aqueous fraction by prcipitation with ethanol. If blunt ends are required, the preparation is treated for 15 minutes at 15 with 10 units of Polymerase I lenow , phenol chloroform extracted, and ethanol precipitated. Size separation of the cleaved fragments is performed using 6 percent polyacrylamide gel described by Goeddel, D., et al, NucleicAcids Res., 8 4057 1980 incorporated herein by reference. For liyation approximately equimolar amounts of the desired components, suitably end tailored to provide correct matching are treated with about 10 units T4 DNA ligase per 0.5 g DNA. When cleaved vectors are used as components, it may be useful to prevent religation of the cleaved vector by pretreatment with bacterial alkaline phosphatase. For analysis to confirm correct sequences in pla mids constructed, the ligation mixtures are used to transform E. coli K12 strain 294 ATCC 3144o , and successful transformants selected by ampicillin resistance where appropriate.Plasmids from the transformants are prepared, analyzed by restriction and or sequenced by the method of Messing, et al, Nucleic Acids Res., 9 309 1981 or by the method of Maxam, et al, Methods in Enzymology, 65 499 1980 .ExamplesThe following examples are intended to illustrate but not to limit the present invention.Synthesis and Expression of Human IGF 1 Enzymes were obtained from the following suppliers New England Biolabs restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase Bethesda Research Labs restriction enzymes, Bart.

The 1 protein structure of the human IGF 1 molecule has been determined 1 . Based upon tis protein sequence and the genetic code, a DNA sequence coding for mature human IGF 1 protein, including all possible base substitutions at any one base position, was determined by computer analysis Genentech Untrans Program . Using a restriction site analysis program Genentech Research Prograin , all potential restriction sites located in all possiole DNA sequences consistently coding for the same protein were found.Three sites internal to the coding sequence were selected Pstl, BamHI, and AvaII. Two additional sites were placed at the ends, just outside of the coding sequence of the mature protein oneEcoRI site before the initiation codon, AUG, and the Sali site following the tennination codon, TAG of the coding sequence. The choice of these sites facilitatcd the cloning of the coding sequence in separate parts, each of which suDsequently could be excised and then assembled to form an intact synthetic IGF 1 gene. This construction involved the assembly of 4 parts1 2 parts forming the left half, 2 parts forming the right half.Each part consisted of two single strands of chemically synthesized ONA see Fig 1 .Proposed synthetic fragments were also analyzed for internal complementarity. The constructions used to generate these four parts employed the use of DNA Polymerase I repair synthesis of synthetic oligonucleotide substrates having 9 lO bp stretches of complementary sequence at their 3 termini. In the presence of DNA Polymerase I Klenow and the four deoxynucleoside triphosphates, these primer templates were extended to become full length double strandedDNAs. To prevent priming at locations other than the desired portions as well ds self hybridizations, each set of single strandedDNAs were analyzed by a computer program Genentech HomologyProgram , and wherever possible, sequences which would have potentially led to hairpin loops, self priming, or mis priming, were eliminated by alternate codon usage.Each of these four double stranded DNAs were synthesized to include 9 12 additional bp of non IGF 1 coding DNA at each end see Fig., 2 . This additionalDNA was included to allow generation of sticky ends by restriction enzyine digestion. The sticky ends thus formed facilitated the ligation of the double stranded pieces to contiguous coding sections of the synthetic gene or into a cloning vehicle. The 9 12 extra bp of double stranded DNA beyond the restriction site at the end of each part see Fig. 2 allowed for theTdT mediated fonnation of single stranded oligodeoxycytidine strands at the 3 ends of each double stranded DNA section. These oligodeoxycytidine tailed double stranded DNAs could then be annealled into a complementary oligodeoxyguanosine tailed PstI site of a cloning vehicle. Once cloned, and sequenced to ensure te correct base sequences, the parts could be easily isolated and ligated following restriction enzyme cleavage at the restriction sites selected at the ends of each of the four parts, to fonn the intact synthetic IGF 1 gene. The method used successfully here was similar to that described by Rossi et al. 28 however, attempts at the construction and cloning of the IGF 1 coding sequence using the Rossi et al. method 28 with only two base pairs of extra DNA beyond the restriction enzyme recognition sites repeatedly failed. The method employed here also differs from the Rossi et al. procedure 28 in that restriction sites placed at both ends of a double stranded DNA allow for the convenience of cloning each double stranded DNA fragment, individually, by dC tailing and annealling into a dG tailed vector, a method which in practice requires less of the double stranded DRA than three part ligations.Chemical Synthesis Eight fragments, 43, 43, 46, 46, 46, 46, 54, and 46 bases in length see Fig. 1 , were chemically synthesized according to the method of Crea and Horn 2 , the only change being the use of mesitylene nitrotriazole as the condensing agent rather than 2,4,6 Tri i sopropyl benzenesul fonyl chloride tetrazol e. The syntheses of the fragments were accomplished from the appropriate solid support cellulose by sequential addition of the appropriate fully protected dimer or trimer blocks. The cycles were carried out under the same conditions as described in the synthesis of oligothymidilic acid see Crea et al., suprd . The final polymers were treated with base aqueous conc. NNZ3 and acid 80 percent HoAc , the polymer pelleted off, and the supernatant evaporated to dryness. The residue, dissolved in 4 percent aq.NH3, WdS washed with ethyl ester 3X and used for the isolation of the fully deprotected fragment. Purification was accomplished by electrophoresis using 20 percent polyacrylamide gels. The pure oligonucleotide was ethanol precipitated following gel elution. 225 285 pmoles of each chemically synthesized fragment was mixed with an equivalent amount of the complementary single stranded DNA fragment i.e. 1L 3L 2L 4L 1R 3R, 2R 4R in the presence of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates at a final concentration of 200 M with the exception of dCTP. dCTP was added to a concentrdtion of 5 M as a a32P labeled isotope with a specific activity of 1000 2000Ci mmol to allow easy monitoring of the repair synthesis reaction product.The reactions were carried out in a buffer containing a final concentration of SOmM Tris HCl pH 7.5 20 mM MgCl2 20 mMDTT and 154 DNA Polymerase I Klenow in a reaction volume of 200 Reactions were allowed to proceed at 4 for 12 18 hrs. Upon completion, EDTA was added to a concentration of 25 mM. Sample buffer containing the mixes were phenol extracted, CHCl3 extracted 2X, and products were etOH precipitated. Pellets were taken up in .3 M NaOAc and the DNA reprecipitated with etOH. After dissolving the pellets in H20, the 1L 3L and 2L 4L products were then digested separately with PstI in 100 l reaction mixes containing 1X PstI buffer SOmiA NH4 2SO4, 20 m, Tris HC1 pH 7.5, 10 mN MgCl2 , and 70 U PstI. After 4 hrs, EDTA was added to a concentration of 10 m t, and the material was ethanol precipitated. Pellets were then taken up in .3 M NaOAc and reprecipitated, then taken up in H20. The PstI di3ested 1t 3L product was digested with EcoRI at 37 in a 100 l reaction mix 1XEcoRI buffer 150 tntM NaCl, 6 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 6 mM MgCl2 and 70 U EcoRI. The PstI digested 2L 4L product was digested at 37 with BamHI in a 100 l reaction mix in 1X BamHI Buffer 150 iii 4 NaCl, 6 mM Tris HCl pH 7.9, 6 mM 9Cla and 70 U BamHI. After 4 hrs,EDTA was added to both mixtures, and sample buffer was added. They were electrophoresed on a 6 percent polyacrylamide slab gel.Six percent slab gels were cast with a mixture containing 6 percent w v acrylamide 20 to 1 ratio of acrylamide to Bis acrylamide 1XTBE, 1 percent APS and 0.1 percent TEED. Reaction products were located on the gel by autoradiography and the oand corresponding to the 45 bp EcoRI PstI digested 1L 3L product Part 1 see Fig. 3 and the band corresponding to the 50 bp PstI BamHI digested 2L 4L product Part 2 see Fig. 3 were excised from the gel, the material electroeluted in 0.2X TBE, phenol extracted, CHCl3 extracted, and ethanol precipitated. Parts 1 and 2 were dissolved in H2O.Cloning Vector Prep. Cloning vector was prepared by digesting 20 g pBR322 15 with 50 U EcoRI and 50 U BamHI, in IX RI Buffer at 379 for 6 hr. After addition of EDTA to a concentration of 10 mM, sample buffer was added, and the mixture was run on a 5 percent polyacrylamide gel.The gel was developed by staining 10 in H20 containing 5 g ml Et. Bromide, rinsing 2X in H20 and placing upon a UV transilluminator 302 nM . the band corresponding to the ca. 3712 bp EcoRI BamHI digested pBR322 molecules was cut from the gel. TheDNA was electroeluted from the gel slice, phenol extracted, CHCl3 extracted 2X, and ethanol precipitated. The pellet was dissolved inH20 and was ready for ligation.Ligation. In a three part ligation see Fig. 4 , in which the molar ratio of inserts to vector in the ligation reaction was approximately 10 to 1, parts 1 and 2 were ligated into the EcoRI BamHI digested 322 vector in 1X T4 DNA liyase buffer cont. 50 mM Tris HC1 pH 7.8 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM DTT, 1 mM rATP and 800 U T4 DNA ligase NEB . The reaction was carried out at 14 for 12 16 hrs.Transfonnations E. coli strain 294 was used as the transfonnation host, using the procedure of M. Dagert and S.D. Ehrlich 3 . The transformed cells were plated on L8 agar plates containing ampicillin 20 g ml LB Amp plates and transformants were screened and grown in LB medium containing ampicillin at 20 g ml ampicillin. Transformants were screened using a modification of the rapid miniscreen method ofBirnboim and Doly 4 . Miniprep DNA prepared as such was digested witn EcoRI and BamHI and run on polyacrylamide slab gels.Several transformants which illustrated a ca. 218 bp EcoRI BamHI insert were grown in large scale and plasmids from each were isolated and sequenced according to the procedure of Maxam and Gilbert 5 to confirm the correct chemical synthesis and construction. The pBR322 vector containing the complete correct left half sequence of IGF 1 was called IGF 1 LH 322 see Fig. 5 .Cloning of Fragments of the Right Half of IGF 1. Using the identical conditions of DNA Polymerase I mediated repair synthesis, the two pairs of fragments comprising the right half of the synthetic IGF 1 were converted into double strandedDNAs. After the DNA Polymerase I reactions, and without enzymatic digestion, the 1R 3R Part III and 2R 4R Part IV reactions were run on a 6 percent polyacrylamide slab gels. The 83 bp Part III and 91 bp Part IV bands were located by autoradiography and cut from the gel. After electroelution the ethanol precipitated double stranded DNAs were dC tailed see Fig. 6 using the procedures of Villa Komaroff et al. 6 and Rowenkamp and Firtel 7 . Reactions were carried out in 50 til vols. of 1X tailing mix cont. .2M Pot.Cacodylate, 25 mM Tris HCl pH 6.9, 2 mM DTT, .5 mMCoCl2 and 22 m dCTP. After prewarming at 37 for 10 , the 150 second reaction was begun by the addition of 10 20 units of terminal nucleotidyl transferase and terminated by addition of EDTA followed by phenol extraction, CHCl3 extraction 2X, and ethanol precipitation. These oligo dC tailed Parts III and IV were then separately mixed with equimolar amounts of oligo dG tailed PstI cut pBR322 vector in 50 l of 1X annealling buffer .1M NaCl 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.8, 1 inti EDTA at a final DNA concentration of 1 2 g ml. After heating to 75 C, the mixes were gradually cooled to 4 over a period of 16 hr and the mix transformed into competent E. coli 294 cells prepared according to the procedure of Dagert and Ehrlich 3 .Transformed cells were plated on LB Tetracycline Agar plates and grown in LB Tetracycline medium at tetracycline concentrations of 5 g ml. Tetracycline resistant transfornants were picked and plated onto LB Ampicillin Agar plates to check for insertions at the PstI site. Several tetracycline resistant, Ampicillin sensitive colonies for each Part 3 and 4 were miniscreened and those exhibiting insertions at the PstI locus were grown in large scale and sequencedDy the Maxam and Gilbert technique 5 to confirm the correct DNA sequences of Parts 3 and 4. Construction of an Intact Synthetic HuIGF 1 Coding SequencePreparation Parts 3 and 4. Parts 3 and 4 were separately removed from their vectors by digestions of 20 g of each vector with AvaII in 1X Avall buffer 60 mM 4aCl, 6 m4 Tris HCl pH 8.0 10 mM MgCl2 6 mM 2 mercaptoethanol1 and 30 U of AvaII. After 6 hr., at 37 , EDTA was added to the 150 iil reactions to a concentration of 15 mM and the material phenol extracted, CHCl3 extracted 2X and ethanol precipitated. The Part 3 pellet was then taken up in 1X BamHI buffer and digested in a volume 150 l with 30 U BamHI at 37 for 4 llr. The pellet containing Part 4 was digested with 30 U SalI in 150 l of 1X Sail buffer at 37D for 4 hr. Botch digests were then run on 6 percent polyacrylamide slab gels and stained. The Si bp band representing Part 3 and the 62 bp band representing Part 4 were removed from the gels and the J NA electroeluted, phenol extracted, CHCl3 extracted 2X and ethanol precipitated. Pellets were then taken up in H20 and were ready for ligation.Vector Preparation 20 g of the IGF 1 LH 322 vector das digested with 50 U of BamHI and 50 U of SalI in a 200 l reaction containing 1X BamHI buffer at 37 for 6 hr. After addition of EDTA to a concentration of 15 mM, the digestion mix was run on a Ï percent polyacrylamide slab gel, ethidium bromide stained and the 3814 bp band excised from the gel. After el ectroel ution, phenol extraction, chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the DNA pellet was taken up in H20 and was ready for ligation with Parts 3 and 4 in a three part ligation.The ligation was performed under conditions described above for a three part ligation see Fig. 7 . Parts 3 and 4 were present in the ligation mix at a 10 fold molar excess of inserts to vector. The mix was transformed into competent . coli 294 cells prepared according to the Dagert and Ehrlich procedure 3 and plated ontoLB Ampicillin plates. Several transformants were mini screened and two clones exhibiting a ca. 115 bp BamHI SalI fragment were grown in large scale and their plasmids prepared. Both strands of the intact synthetic gene were sequenced by the Maxam Gilbert technique 5 to confine the correct sequence. The pBR322 plasmid containing the complete correct sequence coding for Human IGF 1 was called pBR322HuIGF 1. Human IGF 1 ExpressionIGF 1 Fusion Expression in Bacteria Initial attempts were to obtain expression of IGF 1 as a fusion protein. Ta accomplish this, both the pNCV 9 and the pNCVsLE 10 expression vectors were used. The pHCVsLE exprossion vector is a derivative of the pNCV vector and uas prepared as follows ptCV was treated with BgII, which cleaves at the 13 codon of tile LE fusion.The site was converted to an ECoR1 cleavage site using syntheticDNA, to give the expression vector pt 4CVsLE. The synthetic DNA introduced into the plasmid has the sequence 5 GATCCAGAATTC 5 GATCGAATTCTG and this sequence was introduced into the plasmid GATC CAGAATTC GTCTTAAGCTAG As a strategy to release the fused human IGF 1 protein from the trp fusion protein, a linker was designed such that an enzymatic proteolysis method reported by Wunsch et al. 8 could be applied to this expression system.To accomplish this, a DNA linker ProAla 5 AATTCCCTGCCG 3 3 GGGACGGCCAG 5 was chemically synthesized by standard methods 2 which when linked to the trp fusion protein and the IGF 1 gene, coded for the amino acid residues Proline and Alanine followed by Glycine and Proline which are the first two amino acid residues of IGF 1 and preceded by Proline andAlanine together comprise a recognition site for a collagenase isolated from Clostrndium histolyticum 11,12 . This enzyme reportedly acts at such a site to cleave the alanine glycine peptide bond. To construct a DNA sequence coding for a fusion protein with a collagenase cleavage site, 30 g pBR322 HuIGF 1 plasmid was cleaved with 50 U BamHI and 50 U Pvul enzyme in 200 l 1X BamHI buffer at 37 for 6 hours. After addition of EDTA to a concentration of 15 St, the reaction mix was chromatographed on a 6 percent polyacrylamide slab gel. The smaller PvuI BamHI fragment 725 bp was isolated and digested with 40 UAvaII in 150 l 1X Sau96I buffer 60 mM NaCl, 6 m 4 Tris HCl pH 7.4, 15 m4 i4gCl2, 6 mM 2 mercaptoethanol . After addition of EDTA to a concentration of 15 ml, the resulting mix chromatographed on a 5 percent polyacrylamide slab gel.The smaller Sau961 BamHI fragment 86 bp was extracted from the gel, phenol extracted, chloroform extracted 2X, and ethanol precipitated. This fragment was ready for ligation. 200 pmols of linker fragments were kinased with 100 U polynucleotide kinase in 20 iil of 1X polynucleotide kinase buffer 70 mA Tris HCl pH 7.6 10 mM MgCl2 5 in A DTT 1 mM rATP at 37 for 1 hour. The reaction was terminated by heating to 650C for 5 minutes. 100 pmols of the kinased linker fragments were ligated to the 86 bp Sau96I BamHI fragment with 400 U of T4 DNA ligase in 30 iil of 1X T4 DNA ligase buffer at 14 for 12 1t hours. The ligation reaction was terminated by addition of EDTA to a concentration of 15 mM followed by phenol extraction, chloroform extraction 2X, and ethanol precipitation.The pellet was then taken up in 1X BamHI buffer and digested in a 100 l reaction with 50 U of EcoRI and 50 U of BamHI at 37 for 6 hrs. After terminating the digestion with EDTA, the mixture was chromatographed on a 6 percent polyacrylamide slab gel and the newly created 97 bp EcoRI BamHI fragment was extracted from the gel, and prepared for ligation. The vector to receive this new fragment was prepared by digesting 30 g pBR322 HuIGF 1 with 100 U of each EcoRI and BamHI in 200 l of 1X BamHI buffer at 37 for 8 hr. The reaction was terminated, chromatographed on a 6 percent polyacrylamide slab gel and the larger band .3830 bp representing the EcoRI BamHI digested plasmid was isolated and tire plasmid DNA extracted and prepared for ligation as above. In a 30 l ligation reaction containing a 10 fold molar excess of insert fragment to vector, the EcoRI BamHI fragment was ligated into the EcoRI BamHI digested plasmid pBR322 HuIGF 1 under standard ligation conditions mentioned above. Competent E. coli 294, prepared as above 3 , were used as transfonnation hosts and the transfonned cells were plated ontoLB Ampicillin agar plates. Several transformants were picked, miniscreened as above 4 , and two exhibiting an EcoRI BamHI insertion were grown in large scale and their plasmids purified. Using theMaxam Gilbert procedure 5 the construction was sequenced to verify the correct synthesis and insertion of the EcoRI Sau96I collagenase linker.This plasmid as called pBR322 HuSynIGF l M. To prepare this EcoRI SalI IGF 1 coding sequence for insertion into pNCV and pNCVsLE, 30 g of pBR322 HuSynIGF 1 M was digested with 70 U ofSall in 200 jil of 1X SalI Duffer 150 mM NaCl, 6 mM Tris HCl pH 7.9 6 mM MgCl2 6 mM 2 mercaptoethanol at 37 for 6 hours. After addition of EDTA to 15 mM, the mixture was phenol extracted, chloroform extracted 2X, and ethanol precipitated. Using standard chemical synthesis procedures 2 a Sall EcoRI linker 5 TCGACGTACATG 3 3 GCATGTACTTA 5 was synthesized and 400 pmols kinased, as above. 200 pmols of the kinased linker was ligated to the Sail digested pBR322 HuSynIGF 1 M prepared above with 800 U T4 DNA ligase in 30 l of IX ligation buffer for 12 16 hours at 140C. After termination of the reaction with EDTA, the mixture was phenol extracted, chloroform extracted 2X, and ethanol precipitated. The pellet was then taken up in 1X EcoRI buffer and digested with 100 U EcoRI in a volume of 200 l for 8 hours at 37ç. After addition of EDTA to a concentration of 15 mM, the mixture was chromatographed on a 6 percent polyacrylamide slao gel. The gel was stained and the 230 bp band corresponding to the EcoRI EcoRI HuIGF 1 fragment was extracted from the gel, phenol extracted, chloroform extracted 2X, and ethanol precipitated. This fragment was ready for ligation into pNCYsLE. and pNCVsLE pNCV and pNCVsLE were prepared for ligation by digestion of 20 g of each with 100 U EcoRI in 200 l 1X EcoRI buffer at 37 for 8 hours.After digestion, 200 U of bacterial alkaline phosphatase was added to each reaction and the mixtures warned to 65 C for 2 hours. EDTA was added to a concentration of 15 mí4 and the mixes were phenol extracted 3X, chloroform extracted 2X and then ethanol precipitated. These expression vectors were prepared for ligation. Ligations of the EcoRI EcoRI Human lGF i fragment into the two expression vectors were perfonned in 30 ,1 reaction volumes in 1X T4 DNA ligase buffer with 800 U T4 DNA liyase at 14 for 12 1o hours. TheEcoRI EcoRI fragment was present at a 10 fold molar excess to vector. Competent E. coli 294 were prepared 3 ATCC 31446 and used as transfonnation hosts for the ligations. Transformed cells were plated onto L3 agar plates containing tetracycline 5 g ml LB Tet plates and transfonnants were miniscreened 4 . Miniscreen plasmid DNA from transformants of the pNCV IGF 1 construction were digested with both PstI and BglII to determine the orientation of the EcoRI fragment insertions.Two clones whose plasmids contained a 570 bp BglII PstI fragment as opposed to a 690 bp fragment were grown in large scale and their plasmids prepared. The construction was sequenced using the Maxam Gilbert procedure 5 to confirm the correct insertion at the junction of the trp fusion and IGF 1 protein coding sequences as well as retention of the desired reading frame. Plasmids with the correctly inserted IGF 1 fragment were called pNCVLE IGF l. Transformants of the pNCV sL IGF 1 construction were also miniscreened by the same procedure 5 , and the plasmid DNAs were digested with HincII and PstI.Two clones exhibiting a 150 bp HincII PstI fragment as opposed to a 105 bpHincII HincII fragment were grown in large scale and their plasmids prepared. Using the Maxam Gilbert techniques 5 , the functions of the trp fusion and IGF 1 protein coding sequences were sequenced to ascertain proper orientation and retention of the proper reading frame. Those plasmids possessing the correct insertion and proper reading frame were called pNCV sLE IGF 1. To attempt expression of each of these constructions, two clones, one possessing pNCV IGF 1 and the other possessing pNCV sLE IGF l, were inoculated into 10 ml 49 Tetrdcycline culture medium supplemented with 0.5 mg ml Tryptophan. A clone containing pNCY LE with no IGF 1 gene insert was also inoculated into culture medium to provide as a negative control in assays. After 12 16 hours growth at 37 with agitation, 0.5 ml of these cultures were used to inoculate 250 milliliters of M9 Tetracycline culture medium. After groin for 12 16 hours at 37 with agitdtion, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 minutes in aSorvall GSA rotor. The refractile bodies were purified from the pelleted cells by a suspending the host cells in a buffered solution of ionic strength suitable to solubilize most of the host protein, b subjecting the suspension to cell wall me.brane disruption, c centrifuging the disrupted suspension at low speed to for. a pellet, optionally repeating the foregoing steps, and d recovering the heterologous protein as refractile bodies in the pellet Reference 13 .A small quantity of refractile particles of each of the three preparations was boiled in SDS and 2 mercaptoethanol containing sample buffer and run onSDS polyacrylamide slab gels according to the Laemmli method 14 . The size of the protein expressed by pNCY IGF 1 LE IGF 1 was 28,670 Daltons see Figure 7 , and 9770 Daltons for the pNCY sLE IGF 1 protein sLE IGF 1 see Figure 8 . These two expressed proteins were subjected to solubilization in 6M Guanidine HCl followed by 50 fold dilution with dilute buffers. The final buffer for pNCV IGF 1 after dilution was 0.12M Guanidine HCl .05 ii Tris HCl pH 8, 20 percent glycerol 0.1 mg ml BSA .15 M NaCl 0.1 mM EDTA and the final buffer after.dilution of the pNCV sLE IGF 1 refractile bodies was 0.14 M Guanidine HCl 25 m M Tris HCl pH 7.6 10 nM CaC12. After spinning out particulate matter, the two solutions containing solubilized trp IGF l fusion proteins were assayed by a radioimmune assay procedure of Furlanetto et al. 23 , as modified by Hintz et al. 24 . Both fusion proteins demonstrated activity in this assay. A negative control prep was also included in the assay and the control exhibited no measurable activity. Expression and Secretion in Yeast To avoid the necessity of refractile body pu rification and solubilization, from bacterial cell lysates, yeast expression secretion systems were sought as an alternative. Aside from the advantage of avoiding protein purification from cell lysates, coupled expression secretion systems might obviate a subsequent in vitro processing step to remove a fused protein. Available were three yeast expression secretion systems. These were 1 yeast CL factor 22 , employing yeast a factor promoter and preprosequence 2 yeast invertase 15 consisting of the invertase promoter and signal sequence and 3 a hybrid, composed of the PGK promoter 25 and invertase signal 16 .Yeast Alpha Factor Promoter Pre Alpha Factor IGF 1 Plasmid Construction To obtain expression of IGF 1 using the a factor promoter and preprosequence, a plasmid constructed by Singh 22 was used. Plasmid P65 Fig. 9 possesses sequences of the a factor promoter, a factor preprosequence, yeast 2 micron terminator, the yeast Trp 1 gene, as well as portions of the pSR322 plasmid.Due to the dearth of convenient restriction sites in the a factor preprosequence, to insert the IGF 1 coding sequence, the identical 230 bp EcoRI EcoRI HuSynIGF 1 ,4 fragment that was ligated into pNCV and pNCVsLE as mentioned previously in bacterial construction was used. This EcoRI EcoRI fragment contained the collagenase recognition site Proline Alanine Glçcine Proline, and allowed for collagenase digestion should IGF 1 be secreted as a fusion protein. The protein expressed in this construction see Fig. 10 consists of the prepro a factor protein fused to IGF 1. To insert the 230 bp EcoRI EcoRI fragment, the plasmid P55 was partially digested in 1X EcoRI buffer with EcoRI, and then sized upon a 0.7 percent horizontal agarose gel. The band corresponding to the linearized singularly restricted plasmid was excised, eluted from the gel, and phenol extracted, chloroform extracted 2X, and then ethanol precipitated. This DNA pellet was then taken up in 50 m, Tris HCl pH 8 and treated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase under conditions to ensure 100 percent dephosporylation of the 5 protruding ends.Following this treatçment, the phosphatase activity was removed by first adding EDTA to a concentration of 15 mM, then extracting the DNA with phenol 3X, chloroform extracting 2A, and ethanol precipitating the vector. This material then contained linearized P65 vector, digested with EcoRI in either of two locations one, either at the EcoRI site upstream of the factor promoter and preprosequence, or at another, at the EcoRI site just downstream of the a factor promoter and preprosequence. The 230 bp EcoRI EcoRI IGF 1 fragnent was ligated into the vector. The desired location of insertion was at the EcoRI site just downstream from the a factor promoter and preprosequence. The ligation was carried out under standard ligation conditions and the transfonnation hosts were competent E. coli 294 prepared according toDagert and Ehrlich 3 . The transformed cells were plated ontoLB Amp Agar plates. Several transformants were miniscreened according to the method of Birnboim and Doly 4 , and plasmid DNA prepared as such was digested both SalI and HindIII in the appropriate buffers. One of several clones which contained a plasmid with an 110 bp EcoRI HindIII fragment was grown in large scale and its plasmid was purified.This plasmid, YEp9T a factor EcoRI EcoRI IGF 1 see Fig. 11 , was used to transform competent yeast strain 20B 12 atrp pep4 cells according to the Hitzeman modification 19 of Hinnen et al. 17 and Beggs et al. 18 procedures. Two such transfonnants, as well as a negative control transformant with no IGF 1 insertion in the plasmid , were grown in suspension as were those of the yeast pre invertase IGf 1 plasmid transformations.Supernates were tested for secreted IGF 1 activity, as measured by the radioimmune assay procedure of Furlanetto et al. 23 as modified byHintz et al. 24 . Both supernates of transformants having plasmids withIGF 1 inserts contained IGF 1 activity and the negative control supernate did not. One of these transformants was grown in large scale in a 10 liter fermenter and the supernate contained secreted IGF 1 activity at a peak level of 3ssg ml. The IGF 1 activity of the fennentation supernate was also demonstrated by a placental membrane radioreceptor assay developed by Horner et al. 26 .Yeast Invertase Promoter Signal IGF 1 Plaid Construction Based upon evidence of correct processing and secretion in yeast of proteins with heterologous signal sequences 16 , the yeast invertase expression secretion systein became of interest. Attempted first was expression of the yeast invertase signal protein fused to IGF 1 Fig.12 , coupled with the processing and secretion of IGF 1, using the invertase promoter as a starting point for transcription. The yeast invertase signal coding sequence was attached to the IGF 1 gene by the use of a NcoI HindIII 400 bp3 fragment containing the initiation ATG codon and 6 end of the signal DNA sequence, and 4 DNA fragments synthesized by standard procedures 2 AGCTTTCCTTTTCCTTTTGGC 3 3 AAGGAAAAGGAAAACCGACCAA 5 5 TGGTTTTGCAGCCAAAATATCTGCAG 3 3 AACGTCGGTTTTATAGACGTCCAG U The construction began with the isolation of the 90 bp AvaII BajnHI IGF i left half fragment by AvaII digestion of a 730 bp PvuI BamHI fragment isolated from PvuI BamHI digested p8R322 HuSynIGF 1. After phosphorylation of all four synthetic DNA fragments using standard kination conditions, the four synthetic fragments were mixed with the AvaII BamHI IGF 1 left half fragment and ligated using standard ligation conditions. Following inactivation of the ligase by phenol and chloroform extraction 2X, the ethanol precipitated DNA pellet was dissolved and digested with HindlIl and BamHI in the appropriate buffers. Newly constructed HindIII BamHI ca. 140 bp fragment was isolated and extracted from a 6 percent polyacrylamide gel. This material was then ligated into HindIII BamHI digested pBR322 vector, whicn had been first digested with HindIII, then BamHI in the appropriate buffers, followed by purification of the 4014 bp vector fragment from a 6 percent gel. The transfornation host was competent E. coli 294 prepared by standard procedures 3 and the transformed cells were plated ontoLB Ampicillin agar plates. Several transfonnants were miniscreened by the Birnboim Doly procedure 4 and their plasmid DNAs digested withEcoRI and BamHI. Two plasmids containing a 167 bp EcoRI BamHI fragment illustrating the insertion of a 140 bp fragment into the HindIII andBamHI sites were grown in large scale and their plasmids prepared.Using Maxam Gilbert sequencing techniques 5 , the entire 43 bpHindIlI AvaII section of DNA was sequenced to confirm the correct chemical synthesis and construction. The correctly constructed plasmid was called pBR322 P I HuSynIGF HindIII BamHI 4154 bp . To insert the right half of the IGF 1 gene, this newly created plasmid was digested with BamHI SalI in the appropriate buffers and the larger fragment 3879 bp was purified by gel fractionation. pBR322HuSynIGF was digested with BamHI SalI in the appropriate buffers and the 115 bp BamHI SalI fragment corresponding to the right half of the IGF 1 gene was isolated by gel fractionation. This 115 bp BamHI SalI IGF 1 right half fragment was then ligated into the BamHI SalI digested pBR322 P I IGF 1 LH HindIII BamHI vector using standard ligation conditions.Competent E. coli strain 294 prepared according to Dagert and Ehrlich 3 were used as transformation hosts and transformed cells were plated onto LB Amp Agar plates. Several transformants were miniscreened using standard techniques 4 and plasmid DRA prepared as such was digested with EcoRI and SalI in the appropriate buffers and those plasmids illustrating an insertion of the 3amH1 SalI fragment corresponding to the right half of IGF I were called p3R322 P I HuSynIGF l HindIlI Sall. One of the clones containing the pBR322P I IGF 1 HindIII SalI plasmid was grown in large scale and the plasmid was isolated.This plasmid was then digested with HindIII and Salt in the appropriate buffer to prepare a 255 bp HindIll Sall fragment containing all of the IGF 1 gene and the 3 portion of the yeast invertase signal coding sequence. This fragment of DNA was isolated by polyacrylamide gel fractionation and prepared for ligation by standard techniques. The 400 bp NcoI HindIII fragment containing the 5 end of the DNA sequence coding for the invertase signal as well as the yeast invertase promoter was created by NcoI and HindIII digestion of plasmid YIpsp LeIFA 16 in the appropriate buffers. The Ylpsp LeIFA plasmid was first digested with NcoI to completion in the appropriate buffer, then phenol extracted, chloroform extracted 2X and ethanol precipitated. The linearized molecules were then taken up in 1X HindIII buffer and partially digested to generate the needed 4coI HindIII 400 bp fragment which contains an internal HindIII restriction site. This NcoI HindIII fragment was then isolated by gel fractionation and prepared for ligation using standard techniques. To provide for a vector, plasmid pUC12 YI EcoRI BamHi 16 was digested with NcoI and SalI in the appropriate buffers. After purification by gel fractionation, the 2.t kbp vector was eluted from the gel and prepared for ligation by standard techniques. To perform the final construction, a three part ligation was arranged using standard ligation techniques. The DNA used in the ligation included theNcoI SalI digested pUC12 YI EcoRI BamHI 16 , the 400 bp NcoI HindIII and the 255 bp HindlIl SalI fragments.After ligation, the material was transformed into competent E. coli 294 cells prepared according to Dagert et al. 3 . Transfonned cells were plated onto LB Amp Agar plates and several transfonnants were miniscreened using the procedure of Birnboim and Doly 4 . Plasmid DNA prepared as such was digested with NcoI andSalI in the appropriate buffers and one of several clones containing plasmids exhibiting the insertion of a 525 bp NcoI SalI DNA fragment was grown in large scale and its plasmid was purified. As a final step, this plasmid was linearized by digestion with Sail in the appropriate buffer. SalI EcoRI linker, prepared as mentioned above, and kinased under standard kination conditions, was ligated to the linearized vector to convert the SalI ends to EcoRI ends using standard ligation conditions. After termination of the ligation reaction by addition of EDTA to 15 mM, phenol extraction, chloroform extraction 2X and ethanol precipitation, the DNA pellet was dissolved in 1X EcoRI buffer, and digested with EcoRI. The EcoRI digestion released a 1150 bpEcoRI fragment which contained the yeast invertase pronoter, yeast invertase signal coding sequence and the IGF 1 coding sequence in one contiguous sequence.This material was isolated as a 1150 bp band from a 6 percent polyacrylamide slab gel after fractionation and prepared for ligation using standard procedures. The yeast E. coli shuttle vector to receive this EcoRI fragment was prepared by EcoRI digestion of plasmid YEp9T 16 to linearize the vector, followed by treatment of the EcoRI termini with bacterial alkaline phosphatase using conditions recommended by the manufacturer to produce 100 percent dephosphorylation of the 5 protruding ends. The phosphatase reaction was terminated by addition of EDTA to 15 mM and the mixture phenol extracted 3X, chloroform extracted 2X, and then the DNA was ethanol precipitated. After redissolving the DNA pellet in IX ligation buffer, the vector was mixed with the EcoRI 1150 bp fragment and ligated under standard ligation conditions.Competent E. coli 294 cells prepared according to Dagert et al. 3 were used as transformation hosts and the transfornants were plated onto LB Amp Agar plates. To determine the orientation of the insertion, severaL transfornants were miniscreened using the method Birnboim and Doly 4 and plasmid DNAs purified as such were digested with BamHI in the appropriate buffer. One of several transformants possessing plasmids which produced a 1.5 kbBamHI BamHI fragment upon BamHI digestion as opposed to a 475 bp fragment was grown in large scale and its plasmid was purified. This plasmid, called P.I.IGF 1 EcoRI EcoRI P.1. Promoter was used to transfonn competent yeast cells prepared essentially according to the methods ofHinnen, A., et al. 17 , and Beggs, J.D. 18 , but with the modifications of Hitzeman 19 . The yeast strain 20B 12 atrpl pep4 was used and was obtained from the Yeast Genetics Stock Center. In this construction, the expression of IGF 1 begins .ith transcription at the invertase promoter and terminates in the yeast 2 micron sequence. The fusion protein expressed by this construction consisted of the yeast invertase signal fused to the IGF 1 protein, the combined molecular weight of which was 9954 Daltons.Another plasmid with tile EcoRI fragment inserted in the reverse orientation was also used to transform competent yeast cells. In this construction, the IGF 1 was not provided with the yeast terminator. Several transformants were picked and streaked on YNB CAA agar plates. Among these, three transfornants were picked and inoculated into 10 ml of YN3 CAA grow up medium, in shake flasks. A fourth culture was also started using a colony transformed with the same vector, but with the EcoRI fragment inserted into the vector in the reverse orientation.After 15 20 hours growth at 30b, the cultures were sampled 1 ml and cleared of cells by spinning 5 in an eppendorf microfuge. Supernatants were taken off and assayed for secreted activity using the radioimmune assay procedure of Furlanetto et al. 23 as modified by Hintz et al. 24 . The supernates of the three transfornants demonstrated activities of 1.7 to 3.3 ng ml of IGF 1 activity and the negative control showed no activity. To determine intracellular activity, the pellets from 1 ml of culture were washed 1X in 25 mM Tris l1Cl IpH 7.6 , 1 mM EDTA and then lysed by 3 4 minutes of vigorous vortexing in 0.5 ml of the aboveTris EDTA solution with 0.4 ml of glass beads. Assay of the cell lysates demonstrated IGF 1 activities of 1.5 2.8 ng inl in the three IGF 1 secreting transformants andno activity in the negative control transformant. The highest secretor of the three transformants was grown in a 5 liter fermentation and the secreted IGF 1 activity reached a peak of 74 ng ml of supernate.Yeast PGK Promoter Pre Invertase IGF 1 Plasmid Construction One difficulty in the use of the invertase promoter was that it was subject to repression in the presence of glucose. Due to the incompatibility of glucose with high levels of transcription initiation at the invertase promoter, the PGK promoter was sought as an alternative promoter, glucose, being the mainstay carbon source of fermentation processes. To begin construction of the PGK promoter P.I.IuF 1 construction, it was necessary to clone a fragment containing the entire invertase signal coding sequence. To do this, plasmid pLeIF A Invertase Signal 16 was digested with BglII and then 3amHI in the appropriate buffers. This digestion released several fragments, one of which was a G25 bpBglII BamHI fragment which was isolated from a 6 percent polyacrylamide slab gel and prepared for ligation using standard techniques. To clone this fragment, the pUC8 vector 20 was chosen as a cloning vehicle.pUCS plasmid was digested with BamHI in 1X BamHI buffer, treated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase to dephosphorylate the 5 termini, and then run onto and purified from a 5 percent polyacrylamide slab gel. After standard preparation for ligation the BamHI digested vector was mixed with the above 625 bp BglII BamHI fragment, and ligated under typical ligation conditions. The mixture was then transformed into competent E. coli 294 prepared by the Dagert et al. method 3 and the transformed culture plated onto LS Amp Agar plates. Several transfomants were picked and miniscreened using the Birnboim and Doly 4 technique.Miniscreen plasmid DNA was digested with EcoRI and an analytical gel of the digests illustrated two types of plasmids having EcoRI fragments either 260 bp or 385 bp in length. One clone containing a 260 bpEcoRI fragment was grown in large scale and its plasmid purified. This plasmid was called pUC8 P.I. Promotor Signal BglII BamHI. A clone of this type was chosen because of the desired orientation of the inserted BglII BamHI fragment. What was needed from this plasmid was an 20 bp EcoRI HindIII fragment containing the ATG initiation codon and 5 end of the invertase signal coding sequence. To construct the intact invertase signal coding DNA sequence, 150 bpHindIII BamHI fragment containing the 3 end of the signal sequence fused to the left half of the IGF 1 gene was isolated from HindIII BamHI digestion of plasmid pBR322 P.I. IGF LH HindIII BamHI 41D4 bp .Isolation was by polyacrylamide slab gel fractionation, and the DNA band corresponding to the 150 bp fragment was excised and prepared for ligation using standard techniques. To obtain the short 20 bop EcoRI HindIII fragment, the plasmid pUC8P.I. Promotor Signal BglII 8amHI was digested with EcoRI in 1X EcoRI buffer. This digestion released the 260 bp EcoRI EcoRI fragment which was isolated from a 6 percent polyacrylamide slab gel after fractionation of the digestion mixture. This 260 bp fragment was then digested with HindiIl in the appropriate buffer, causing the creation of twoHindIII EcoRI fragments, one 20 bp and the other 240 bp in length.After complete digestion, the digestion was terminated by addition ofEDTA to 15 mM and the entire mix phenol extracted, chloroform extracted 2X, and then ethanol precipitated. A vector was prepared by EcoRI BamHI digestion of p3R322 15 in the appropriate buffers followed by purification of the EcoRI BamHI digested vector from a 5 percent polyacrylamide slab gel. After preparation for ligation using standard techniques, the vector was mixed with the 150 bpHindIII BamHI fragment 3 end of invertase signal Left Half IGF 1 , and the two HindlIl EcoRI fragments the 20 bp fragment containing the 5 end of the invertase signal coding sequence , and the entire mixture was ligated under standard ligation conditions. Competent E. coli 294 prepared according to Dagert and Ehrlich 3 were used as transformation hosts for the ligation, and the transformed cells plated onto LB Amp Agar plates. Several transformants were miniscreened according to Birnboim and Doly 4 and the purified mini screen DNAs were digested with EcoRI and BamHI. One of several clones possessing an 170 bp EcoRI BamHI fragment was grown in large volume and its plasmid purified. This plasmid contained the complete yeast invertase signal coding sequence fused to the left half of IGF 1 and was called P.I. IGF 1 L.H. RI BamHI. The desired 170 bp EcoRI BamHI fragment was isolated from this plasmid by digestion of the plasmid with EcoRI and BamHI in the appropriate buffers followed by slab gel fractionation of the reaction mix. Using standard techniques, the 170 bp band of DNA was prepared for ligation. To complete the construction, the right half of IGF 1 was isolated as an 120 bp BamHI EcoRI fragment from the plasmid P.I. IGF 1EcoRI EcoRI P.I. Promoter by digestion .Yith EcoRI and BamHI in the appropriate buffers followed by elution from a gel slice after polyacrylamide slab gel fractiondtion of the digestion mixture.These two fragments, the 170 bp EcoRI BamHI and the 120 bp 3amHI EcoRI, were ligated together in vitro under standard ligation conditions, with both fragments present in roughly equimolar concentrations. This ligation mixture was then terminated by the addition of EDTA to 15 mM followed by phenol extraction, chloroform extraction 2X, and ethanol precipitation.The DNA pellet was then taken up in IX EcoRI buffer and digested withEcoRI. The digest was then run on a 6 percent polyacrylamide slab gel and the DNA band staining at 290 bp as opposed to 340 bp and 240 bp was excised and prepared for ligation using standard techniques. This 290 bp EcoRI EcoRI fragment contained the entire yeast invertase signal coding sequence fused to the complete IGF 1 coding sequence. To express this protein, it was necessary to select a yeast vector with a promoter. The PGK promoter of the plasmid YEplPT Small see Fig.13 was used. YEplPT Small was constructed as a derivative of YEplPT 21 by ClaI and PvuII digestion of YEplPT in the appropriate buffers.The Clal 5 protruding end was converted to a blunt end by use of DNA polymerase I Klenot under conditions recommended by the vendor. After blunting the ClaI protruding ends, the blunt ends Clal and PvuII of the linearized vector were fused using T4 DNA ligase under standard Thgation conditions. The resultant YEplPT small vector was 5.9 kbp in size or 2.7 kbp smaller than YEplPT . Just as YEp1PT, YEplPT small possesses the 2 micron origin and terminator, the PGK promoter, the TRP1 gene, and sequences from pBR322, including the s lactamase gene. YEplPT Small was employed as a vector by insertion of the 290 bp EcaRI fragment into the unique EcoRI site of the plasmid. EcoRI linearized YEplPT Small vector was prepared by EcoRI digestion of YEplPT small followed by bacterial alkaline phosphatase BAP treatment to prevent religation of the complementary termini . The BAP was removed by phenol extraction 3X, chloroform extraction 2X, and ethanol precipitation. Under standard ligation conditions, the 290 bp EcoRI fragment was ligated into the vector. Competent E. coli 294 prepared according to Dagert and Ehrlich 3 were used as transformation hosts and the transformed culture was plated onto LB hmp Agar plates. Several transfonnants were miniscreened by theBirnboim and Doly procedure 4 and mi ni screen plasmid DNAs were digested with HindIII in the appropriate buffer to determine the orientation of the insert. One of several transformants possessing a plasmid with a 400 bp HindIII fragment was grown in large scale and its plasmid was purified. This plasmid was called YEp1PT Small P.I. IGF 1 PGK promoter see Fig. 14 and was used to transform competent yeast strain 20B 12 ATCC 2062o atrp pep4 cells employing the Hitzeman modification 13 of Hinnen et al. 17 , and Beggs et al. 18 procedures. Several yeast transfonnants were grown in suspension in identical fashion as were those of the P.I. IGF 1 EcoRI EcoRl P.I. promoter plasmid transformation and supernates were measured for activity determined by a radioimmune assay method of Furlanetto et al. 23 as modified by Hintz et al. 24 . Shake flask supernates of three transformants contained activities ranging from 38 to 53 ng ml of supernate. Similarly, one of these transformants was selected and grown in larger scale, utilizing a 10 liter fermenter and the secreted IGF 1 activity in the supernate reached a peak of 780 ng ml. This fermentation supernate was alsosubjected to a radioreceptor assay 26 and was demonstrated to containIGF 1 activity. Mature Human IGF Production To construct a DNA sequence coding for the a factor pre pro protein fused to the DNA sequence coding for mature IGF I, an M 13 in vitro mutagenesis technique was employed. See Regin et al., Proc. Acad.Science USA 75, 4268 Hutchinson, et al., Journal Biological Chem. 253, 6551 Gilliam, et al., Gene 8, 81 and 99 Gillam, et al., Nucleic AcidsResearch 5, 2973 Adelman, et al., DNA June, 1983 . To construct the M 13 plasmid, the plasmid YEp9T a factor ECoRI ECoRIIGF I Figure 16 was digested with Byl 11 and SalI and the ca. 1.5 Kbp fragment containing the a factor promotor signal fused to IGF I was isolated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This fragment was then ligated under standard ligation conditions to an MP 8 BRL vector digested with BamH1 and Sal I, and treated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase.This ligation mix was then transformed into competent JX101 cells prepared according to the method of Dagert and Ehrlich 3 . These transfornants were then mixed with non competent JM1O1 cells grown to log phase, mixed with top agar and plated onto LB agar plates. Several clear plaques were picked and sequenced using the .M 13 dideoxy sequencing technigue to confirm the presence of an insertion into the Sall BamH1 sites of the vector. To perform the deletion according to the method above, a single strand of DNA of the sequence 5 AGAGTTTCCGGACCT CTT TTATCCAAAG 3 was chemically synthesized by standard methods 2 and used to delete theDNA sequence 5 GAGGCTGAAGCTCTAGAATTCCCTGCC 3 3 CTCCG.4CTTCGAGATCfTAAGGfL4CG 5 just preceding the IGF 1 coding sequence of the a factor promotor signalIGF I fusion sequence. This construction was then isolated as a replicative form, using a large scale plasmid preparation procedure from a JM101 cell culture inoculated with this plasmid containing the deletion The isolated replicative form 10 mg was ten digested with SalI. Then phenol chlorogform extracted and then ethanol precipitated and prepared for ligation. To this replicative form was ligated Sal I ECoRl linkers. After ligation and inactivation of the ligase by phenol, chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation, the material was digested with 50 U ECoRl enzyme under standard conditions and then run onto a Ó percent polyacrylamide gel. The ca. 1.5 kbp RI EGoRI fragment released was isolated from the gel and prepared for ligation using standard conditions. Yeast vector was prepared by digestion of 10 my YEP3T plasmid with 50 units of ECoRI followed by treatment with bacterial alkaline phosphatase. The digestion was then repeatedly phenol chlorofonu extracted and then ethanol precipitated and prepared for ligation. The ca. 1.5 kbp tCoRI ECoRI fragment containing the deletion was then ligated to the ECoRI ECORI YEP9T vector and the ligdtion nix was then transferred into competent 294 cells prepared according to the method ofDagert and Erhlich 3 and mini screened using the method of 3irnboin andDoly 4 . DNA prepared was screened by degestion with ECoRI and thoseDNAs illustrating an insertion of the ca. 1.5 kbp fragment were used to transform competent yeast strain 203 12 ATCC 20526 according to the modification of Hitzennan 19 of the Hinner, et al., 17 , and Beggs, et al., 18 procedures. Transformants were then grown in shaker flasks and supernates assayed and shown to have IGF I activity by the radioimmune assay procedure of Furlanetto, et al., 23 as modified by Hintz, et al., 24 . One of these clones were grown in large scale in a 10 liter fermentor and IGF I purified from the supernatant of this fermentation. This material was then subjected to amino terminal protein sequencing and shown to be mature IGF I protein. Human EGF is prepared in accordance ith invention following analogous procedures as those described above. Construction, Expression, and Secretion of Human EGF In a fashion similar to IGF 1, double stranded DNA Fig. 15 synthesized either by chemical means or through polymerization reactions was assembled to form a mature EGF coding sequence, with a codon coding for methionine ATG just preceding the amino terminal asparagine found in the mature protein, and a codon GTC substituting valine for methionine at residue number 21 from the amino t2nninal asparagine. This construction was then attached at the 5 end to an additional coding sequence, which when expressed in yeast or bacteria produced a fusion protein. This fusion protein was then susceptible to CNBr cleavage at the methionine to release the valine substituted human EGF molecule. To secrete the mature form of EGF from yeast, the above sequence coding for the mature protein was attached to the a factor promoter prepro sequence, the codon coding for valine at residue number 21 was replaced by ATG, and the appropriate deletion was made to bring the coding sequence for mature EGF adjacent to the a factor signal coding sequence Figure 15 . This construction was then inserted into the yeast vector Yep9T and transformed into yeast. Transformants produced as such expressed and secreted mature human EGF. In addition, the sequence coding for mature EGF was attached to the preinvertase signal sequence Figure 17 and this construction, when inserted into the yeast vectorYeplPT small containing the PGK promoter, and transformed into yeast, resulted in the expression and secretion of human EGF.Construction, Expression, and Secretion of Human IGF II A double stranded DMA sequence coding for mature IGF II was constructed from a combination of synthetic and natural DrlA sequences Figure 18 . This coding sequence, which did not contain an internal methionine, was attached to the TrpE leader protein coding sequence and was expressed as a fusion protein. ature IGF II was chemically cleaved from the purified fusion product by the action of CNBr upon a methionine residue preceding the first residue alanine of the mature protein. The IGF II coding sequence was also attached to the a factor promoter p repro sequence and after the appropriate deletion was made to bring the 3 end of the a factor signal coding sequence adjacent to the 5 end of mature IGF II coding sequence, the construction was inserted into the Yep9T vector and transformed into yeast. Resultant transfonnants expressed and secreted nature hurnan IGF Il. In the same manner, the sequence coding for mature IGF II was attached to the preinvertase coding sequence. The resultant construction was inserted into YeplPT small and transformed into yeast. Transformants produced as such expressed and secreted mature human IGF II.Pharmaceutical Compositions The compounds of the present invention can be formulated according to known methods to prepare pharmaceutically useful compositions, whereby the human IGF and human EGF or products hereof are combined in admixture with a phannaceutically acceptable carrier vehicle.
