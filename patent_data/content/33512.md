# Separation of aromatic hydrocarbons from petroleum fractions.

## Abstract
An improvement to a continuous solvent extraction steam distillation process for the recovery of aromatic hyd rocarbons inthe range of C₆ C₁₆ from a feed stream containing such aromatics and aliphatic hydrocarbons in the range of C₅ C₁₆ which resides in using two extractive distillation zones thermally linked to recover heat and solvent, thereby resulting in a heat savings.
