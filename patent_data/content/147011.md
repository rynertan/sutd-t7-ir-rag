# A NON CYANIDE SALT BATH AND PROCESS FOR CARBURIZATION OF FERROUS METALS AND ALLOYS

## Abstract
A non cyanide molten salt bath composition for the carburization of objects made of ferrous metals or alloys at a temperature in the range of 900 1050 C comprises a 85 99 of an alkali metal chloride or a mixture of alkali metal chlorides b 0.25 8 of an activator, which is an oxygen contain ing compound barium and or strontium compound and c sufficient amount of finely divided graphite to provide a continuous cover on the surface of the molten salt mixture. The ferrous metal or alloy part is immersed in the molten mixture at a temperature in the range of 900 C to 1050 C.
