# GAS DISCHARGE LOGIC DEVICE FOR USE WITH AC PLASMA PANEL

## Abstract
An AC gas discharge logic device with two input electrodes and an ouput electrode isolated by dielectric material from a dischargable gas. Upon coupling suitable signals to the input electrodes, the gas is discharged and a voltage level at the dielectric material associated with the input electrodes is established which is different than the initial voltage level at the dielectric material associated with the output electrode. The subsequent voltage level of the output electrode after the gas discharge thus approaches the established voltage level at the input electrodes. An AC gas discharge panel with a plurality of the aforementioned logic devices included within the panel structure.
