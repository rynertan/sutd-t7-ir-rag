# Method of improving the conductivity of a microelectronic conductive tungsten silicide film and semiconductor device comprising said film.

## Abstract
A method for preparing a highly conductive layer utilizing a layer of Pt in conjunction with sputter deposited or co evaporated WSi₂ to enhance the conductivity increase of the WSi₂ layer occurring during annealing is described. The Pt layer is deposited as a thin layer directly on top or beneath the WSi₂ layer or may be incorporated within the WSi₂ layer. During annealing platinum atoms diffuse into the WSi₂ film resulting in lower resistivity values than in comparable deposited annealed film wherein the Pt layer has been omitted.
