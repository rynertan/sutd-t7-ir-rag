# LIGHT AND PARTICLE IMAGE INTENSIFIER

## Abstract
A light and charged particle image intensifier 10 receives incident image conveying light or charged particles incident beam 12 and provides to data processing and video equipment signals from which the image conveyed by the incident beam 12 can be constructed and displayed. The beam 12 that is being processed includes visible light reflected from objects and X ray radiation that has been passed through an object such as a human body. The image intensifier includes a scintillator 14 and photocathode unit 16 for converting the incident beam 12 to photoelectrons 18 and a charge coupled device CCD 52 for detecting the photoelectrons 18 and transmitting to the data processing and video equipment information relating to the quantity or energy level as well as the location of the electrons 18 impinging on the sensing areas 54 or SI to SN of the CCD 52 . From this information, the data processing and video equipment can reconstruct the image conveyed by the incident beam 12 . The sensitivity of the device is increased either by imposing an electric field across the photocathode 16 and the CCD 52 to accelerate the photoelectrons or by placing a micro channel processor MCP 20 between the photocathode 16 and the CCD 52 to increase the number of electrons that impinge on the CCD 52 . Alternately, a silicon diode target 42 can be used instead of a CCD 52 to intercept the electrons and an electron beam gun 44 can be used to detect the location and intensity of the charges created on the target 42 by the impinging electrons. Finally, a grid 24 having a number of windows can be used instead of a CCD 52 or a silicon target 42 to detect the location of the electron streams and a photoanode 25 can detect their intensity.
