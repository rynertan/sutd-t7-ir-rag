Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention Before describing the method and the apparatus according to the present invention, products which are subjects of the present invention will first be explained with reference toFig. 1. Hollow bodies to which the present invention is applied are divided roughly into two groups, that is hollow bodies without bottom A D such as pipes and hollow bodies with bottom E and F such as bombs. These hollow bodies are subdivided according to their constructing materials and presence of core material, as shown in Table 1.

Core material denotes a material which serves as a wind ing core during preforming and is then left in the product as a portion S of the constructing material thereof. The principle of the method according to the present invention will now be described with reference to Figs. 2 and 3. The first method shown in Fig. 2 is intended to be applied to the products A , B , E and F shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1. The first method comprises winding core feeding step 1, winding step 2, synthetic resin feeding step 3, hardening step 4, and finishing step 5. The second method shown in Fig. 3 is intended to be applied to the products C and D shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1.The second method comprises winding core feeding step 1, first winding step 2a, first synthetic resin feeding step 3a, intermediate material feeding step 6, second winding step 2b, second synthetic resin feeding step 3b, hardening step 4, and finishing step 5. The winding core feeding step 1 is a step for continuously feeding the winding core for winding in the next step.A core bar, an elastic tubular body, or a core material may be used as the winding core. The sectional shape of the winding core is not limited to a circle but may be any suitable shape such as an ellipse, a polygon, or the like. Further, the longitudinal sectional shape of the winding core may take any suitable shape such as a rectangle, a trapezoid, a circle, an ellipse, or the like. An example in which a core bar is used as the winding core is shown in Fig. 4. A number of core bars lla of substantially the same size are prepared, each of which is provided with a projection 111 at an end and a depression 112 at the other end so as to be connected longitudinally with other core bars. The core bars lla are continuously fed longitudinally thereof, sequentially connected by a conventional connecting machine 12 comprising pinch rollers 121 and a guide 122, and then continuously fed into a winder 200 Fig. 21 of the next step to be described hereinunder. The core bar feeding system described above is suitable for producing the products A , C and E shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1, An example in which a core material is used as the winding core is shown in Figs. 5 and 6. A core material llb is continuously formed by extruding a synthetic resin material through a conventional extrusion molding machine 13. Fig. 5 shows a system for producing a straight tube. The core material feeding system shown in Fig. 5 is suitable for producing the products B and D shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1. Fig. 6 shows a system incorporating a processing machine 14 on the exit side of the extrusion molding machine 13, for producing a.bomb like continuous Varied diameter tube. The core material feeding system shown in Fig. 6 is suitable for producing the product F shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1. While we have described the method according to the present invention with respect to the system for sequentially or continuously feeding the winding core in one direction, the method according to the present invention may take the feeding system in which the winding core is sequentially or continuously moved. For example, in production of a hollow body with bottom but without core material such as a bomb as shown in Fig l E and Table 1, an elastic tubular body llc as shown in Fig. 7 is used as the winding core in the winding core feeding system as shown in Fig. 8. The elastic tubular body llc is provided, as shown inFig. 7, at both ends thereof with smaller diameter portions lllc and, further, at an end with a closing plug 112c and at the other end with a connecting pipe 113c. The elastic tubular body llc is made of an elastic material such as rubber and preferably embedded longitudinally therein with metal wires or the like as reinforcing material. By such construction, the elastic tubular body llc is relatively rigid in the longitudinal direction while flexible and elastic in the circumferen tidal direction. In feeding the winding core, as shown in Fig. 8, two elastic tubular bodies llc are connected in series by means of a connecting pipe 113c, the connected elastic tubular bodies llc are supported at both ends by trucks 15 and supplied thereinto with pressurized air from an end. By the pressurized air, the elastic tubular body llc is enabled to maintain itself in a predetermined shape and added with rigidity in the longitudinal direction. The trucks 15 are moved reciprocatably within a predetermined distance at a predetermined speed. While passing through the winder 200 to be described hereinunder, the elastic tubular body llc is wound on the outer periphery thereof with a linear material. An example of the winding system is shown in Fig. 9, in which when one of the two connected elastic tubular bodies llc has been completely wound thereabout with the linear material, it is replaced by a new elastic tubular body llc and then the remainder of the two connected elastic tubular bodies llc is wound thereon with the linear material. These operations are performed alternately. After a hollow body is formed on the elastic tubular body, the elastic tubular body can be easily separated from the hollow body formed thereon by exhausting the air from it and pulling it from the formed hollow body. Processing of the opening and the bottom of the formed hollow body is performed in the finishing step 5 to be described hereinunder. In a hollow body with bottom, such as a bomb, it is advantageous to perform the finishing step before the formed hollow body has been completely hardened. For example, the opening of the formed hollow body may be provided with screw thread by conventional dies. In the bottom of the formed hollow body, the protrusion is first constricted, then the excess material is removed, and lastly the bottom is shaped smooth by any suitable means such as a conventional press. Referring now to Fig. 10, the principle of the winding step 2 will be described. Along with the winding step 2, the synthetic resin feeding step 3 is performed. For convenience of explanation, however, only the winding step will be described here, and the synthetic resin feeding step 3 will be described in detail hereinunder with reference to Figs. 14 to 18. A winding core 11 is inserted coaxially through a winding disk 21 and a winding drum 22, and supported free from contact therewith. The winding core 11 is movable axially thereof and the winding disk 21 is rotatable about the axis of the winding core 11. The winding disk 21 is provided with at least one guide hole 211 on the outer periphery thereof. A bobbin 23a having a weft linear material 20a wound therearound is ocate at a predetermined position. A binding position 24 is established at a position downstream of and adjacent to the winding disk 21 with respect to the direction of movement of the winding core 11. The relationship between the winding disk 21 and the winding drum 22 is as shown in Figs. IlA to llC, that is, the winding disk 21 and the winding drum 22 may take any of the three different constructions in which they are formed integrally Fig. 11A , they are connected rotatably relative to each other Fig llB , and the winding drum 22 is fixed while the winding disk 21 is supported rotatably therewith Fig. llC .The winding drum 22 is positioned upstream of and adjacent to the winding disk 21 with respect to the direction of movement of the winding core 11. At the binding position 24, a binding linear material 251 is wound around the outer peripheral surface of the winding core 11 using a binder 25 Fig. 21 to be described hereinunder.The linear material 251 used for binding is preferably of the equal quality to the weft linear material 20a. The object of the binding and fixing is to prevent unwinding of the terminal end of the linear material 20a wound on the winding core 11 when the winding disk 21 is reversed in rotation as will be described hereinunder. Accordingly, any other material such as tape, ring, or clip may be used in place of the linear material 251. After the preliminary stage has been finished in the manner described above, the weft linear material 20a is pulled out from the bobbin 23a, passed through a suitable guide 26, wound.on the outer periphery of the winding drum 22 suitable times, passed through the guide hole 211 of the winding disk and andfixed at the leading end thereof to a suitable position on the outer peripheral surface of the winding core 11. Thereafter, the winding disk 21 is rotated in the predetermined direction by a drive mechanism 27 while the winding core 11 is moved axially in the predetermined direction for example, to the right in Fig. 10 . When the winding disk 21 is rotated in either direction in the state described above, the linear material 20a is wound on both of the winding drum 22 and the winding core 11. That is, as shown schematically in Fig. 10, the weft linear material 20a is firstly wound on the winding drum 22, slides thereon, passes through the guide hole 211 of the winding disk 21, and is wound on the winding core 11. The number of turns of the linear material 20a wound on the winding drum 22 is the same as the number of turns of the linear material wound on the winding core 11 except the number of turns thereof initially wound on the winding drum 22. The winding pitch of the weft linear material 20 on the winding core 11 can be changed by controlling the speed of movement of the winding core 11 or the speed of rotation of the winding disk 21. In this manner, the linear material 20a can be wound on the winding core 11 in a rough pitch and on the winding drum 22 in a tight pitch. When a predetermined quantity of the weft linear material 20a has been wound on the winding core 11 or on the winding drum 22, the terminal end of the winding on the winding core 11 is bound and fixed by another linear material such as 251 using the binder 25 at the binding position 24 so as to keep the terminal end of the winding from being unwound off the winding core 11. After the binding and fixing of the weft linear material 20a, the winding disk 21 is rotated in the direction reverse to that in the preceding occasion. In the first half of the reverse rotation of the winding disk 21, the linear material, while being unwound from the winding on the winding drum 22, is wound on the winding core 11 in the direction reverse to that in the preceding occasion. In the second half of the reverse rotation of the winding disk 21, that is, after the winding of the linear material has been unwound out from the winding drum 22, the weft linear material 20a, while being wound on the winding drum 22 in the direction reverse to that in the preceding occasion, is continuously wound on the winding core 11. When a predetermined quantity of the weft linear material 20a has been wound on the winding core 11 or on the winding drum 22, the binding and fixing of the linear material is performed as in the preceding occasion. By repeating sequentially the steps described above, the winding operation shown schematically in Fig. 10 is performed. The reverse rotation of the winding disk 21 is performed preferably in synchronism with the binding and fixing operation.For carrying out the binding and fixing operation smoothly, the movement of the winding core 11 may be temporarily stopped during the binding and fixing operation, or the binding position 24 may be shifted within a predetermined range in time with the speed of movement of the winding core 11. In the winding process of the weft linear material 20a, as described above, since the weft linear material 20a slides on the winding drum 22, it is preferred that the winding drum 22 is plated, attached thereon with a low frictional material, or provided with idle rollers on the outer surface thereof for smooth sliding of the weft linear material thereon. As explained with reference to Fig. 11, there are three different types of combination between the winding disk 21 and the winding drum 22. There is no large difference in effect among these types of combination. In the integral construction between the disk 21 and the drum 22 Fig. llA , the winding operation of the weft linear material is carried out smoothly because the winding of the weft linear material is formed from the side opposite to the disk 21. In the construction in which the disk 21 and the drum 22 are relatively rotatable Fig. 11B , it is possible to apply a brake to the drum 22 during the reverse rotation of the disk 21 to thereby prevent the winding from becoming loose.In the construction in which the winding drum 22 is fixed Fig. llC , winding and unwinding of the winding can be carried out smoothly during the reverse rotation because the winding of the weft linear material is formed from the side of the winding disk 21. By providing the winding disk 21 with a plurality of guide holes 211, it is made possible to wind a plurality of pieces of the weft linear materials 20a simultaneously on the winding core 11. The winder 200 will be described in detail hereinunder with reference to Figs. 22 to 30. The winding step 2 has been described hereinabove with reference to the case in which only one winder 200 is used.However, G plurality of sets of winders 200 may be provided in series as shown in Fig. 12A or only one binder 25 may be provided at the rearmost position so as to be commonly used with a plurality of the winders 200 as shown in Fig. 12B. In the construction of Fig. 12B, in order to concentrate winding positions for the winding core to thereby ens re the binding and fixing of the winding, the winding disk 21 is preferably elongated axially into within the winding disk 21 on the upstream side Fig. 19 . In this way, by providing a plurality of winders 200 in series, it is made possible to wind a plurality of layers of weft linear material 20a on the winding core. In addition to the weft linear material, when necessary, warp linear materials may be used. A warp linear material feeder may be of a conventional construction for feeding warp linear materials on the outer peripheral surface of the winding core along the longitudinal direction thereof. For example, as shown in Figs. 13A and 13B, a warp linear material feeder 28 may be of the construction in which a number of bobbins 23b are disposed on a stand, and a warp linear material 20b payed out from each of the bobbins is directed longitudinally through an annular guide 281. Figs. 13A and 13B show examples of arrangement of the warp linear material feeder 28. That is, only one warp linear material feeder 28 may be used and disposed on either of entrance or exit side of the winder 200 Fig. 13A , or two warp linear material feeders 28 may be used and disposed one in each of entrance and exit sides of the winder 200 Fig. 13B . The synthetic resin feeding step 3 will now be described.The synthetic resin feeding step 3 is carried out in association with the winding step 2 described above, to form a layer of the synthetic resin including the linear materials on the outer periphery of the winding core. This step 3 is shown concretely in Rig. 14, As shown in Fig, 14, a synthetic resin feeder 30D is disposed on the entrance side or on the exit side or on both sides of the winder 200 and has the construction to surround the outer peripheral surface of the cylindrically formed body of the warp linear materials 20b or of the warp linear materials 20b and the weft linear materials 20a. The synthetic resin feeder 300 may take any of the construction, as shown in Fig. 15, in which a nozzle 31 is in direct contact with the outer peripheral surface of the cylindrically formed body to supply a synthetic resin thereto or the construction, as shown in Fig. 16, in which the nozzle 31 is slightly spaced from the outer peripheral surface of the cylindrically formed body, and the warp linear materials 20b or the weft linear materials 20a are guided to the vicinity of the nozzle 31 so as to supply the synthetic resin directly to the warp linear materials 20b or the weft linear materials 20a In the construction of the synthetic resin feeder 300 shown in Fig. 16, a frustoconical body 32 has a frustoconical cover 33 having a substantially identical form thereto and disposed on the outer surface thereof leaving a predetermined clearance 34 between the body 32 and the cover 33. The synthetic resin 30 is supplied to the body 32 through a conduit 35 and squeezed out of the nozzle 31 into the clearance 34. The linear material 20a or 20b is directed from the large diametrical outer peripheral portion of the clearance 34 and led with the synthetic resin out of the small diametrical outer peripheral portion of the clearance 34. Fig. 17 shows a modification of the synthetic resin feeder 300 of Fig. 16, and Fig. 18 is a front view taken from the line XVIII XVIII of Fig. 17. In this modification, the frustoconical body 32 and the frustoconical cover 33 are provided with separate conduits 35a and 35b, respectively.By providing the two separate conduits 35a and 35b, it is made possible to facilitate the supply of the synthetic resin and to mix different kinds of the synthetic resin within the clearance 34. The synthetic resin is preferably a thermoplastic resin. Now, the intermediate material feeding step 6 will be described. This step is for forming the intermediate material layer M consisting of the hardened composite material disposed between the reinforced synthetic resin layers P as shown inFigs. 1C and 1D. The intermediate material layer M is provided for the purpose of reinforcement, heat resistance, heat insulation, or corrosion resistance. The intermediate material is selected from among the hardened composite materials according to the purpose of the use. The synthetic resin feeder 300 described above, when the intermediate material in place of the synthetic resin is supplied thereto, functions as an intermediate material feeder.For example, as shown in Fig. 19, the winding core 11 is formed thereon with the reinforced synthetic resin layer P by the winder 200 and the synthetic resin feeder 300, and then fed to the next winder 200, in which, before winding, an intermediate material 60 is supplied by an intermediate material feeder 600 to around the reinforced synthetic resin layer P to form the intermediate material layer M which is further formed therearound with the reinforced synthetic resin layer P by the winder 200 and the synthetic resin feeder 300. The intermediate material feeder 600 is preferably provided with a conventional screw conveyor 61 for uniform distribution of the intermediate material 60. In the hardening step 4, the synthetic resin and the intermediate material formed around the winding core 11 as described above is hardened. In this step, an unhardened cylindrically formed body is put on a table and left in the air or charged into a heating furnace to be hardened into the cylindrically formed body. Lastly, in the finishing step 5, the hardened cylindrical body is cut to the predetermined size and, if necessary, the wising core is removed therefrom, and then the cylindrically formed body is finished in shape. In the case of a hollow body with bottom, such as a bomb, thread cutting in the opening and flattening or concaving of the bottom may be performed by means of a conventional press or dies before the hardening step. As will be described hereinunder, since the same piece of the weft linear material 20 is oriented in the same.dXirection between the binding linear materials 251 and since the cylindrical body can be so formed that the length of the weft linear material thereof is in the range of 10 20m, the troubles such as different orientation of the weft linear material, local bulging in the binding linear material position, and removal of other binding and fixing member are eliminated by cutting the cylindrically formed body in the vicinity of each binding linear materials 251. A schematic construction of an apparatus for carrying out the first method accoridng to the present invention is shown in Fig. 20. The present apparatus comprises a winding core feeder 100, the winder 200, the synthetic resin feeder 300, a hardening device 400, and a finishing device 500. In an embodiment of the present apparatus, the winding core feeder 100 connects the core bars lia with each other sequentially by means of the connecting machine 12 thereof and feeds the connected winding core to the winder 200. The winder 200 comprises the winding disk 21 and the winding drum 22 for winding the weft linear material 20a on the core bar gila, the warp linear material feeder 28 for arranging the warp linear materials 20b longitudinally around the core bar lia, and the binder 25. The synthetic resin feeder 300 is disposed on each of the entrance side and the exit side of the winder 200. The hardening device 400 comprises a heating furnace 41.The finishing device 500 comprises a cutter 51 and a separator 52. The separator 52 has the similar mechanism to the connector 12 and the functions for separating the previously connected core bars lla and for removing the core bar lla from the formed hollow body. The winder 200 only of the present apparatus will now be described in detail hereunder because other components of the present apparatus have already been described hereinabove or conventional devices are used as such. The winder 200 shown in Fig. 21 corresponds to that shown in Fig. 10. InFig. 21, the binder 25 is disposed at the binding and fixing position 24. The winding disk 21 is rotated by the drive means 27 at a predetermined speed and reverses alternately the direction of rotation with a predetermined period. The binder 25 is satisfactory if it has the function to wind the linear material 251 on the outer peripheral surface of the winding core 11 once or twice and bind it. As the binder having such function, a commercially available automatic packing machine may be utilized. Since such automatic packing machine is capable of operating at a high speed requiring only 2 5 seconds for one cycle of operation, it causes no particular hindrance to the binding operation during the ordinary winding operation In order to make the binding securer, however, it is preferable to stop the winding core 11 temporarily only during the binding operation or to move the binder 25 over a predetermined distance in synchronism with the winding core 11. The actual length of the weft linear material 20a wound helically in the same direction, that is the actual length thereof between the binding linear materials 251, is dependent upon the diameter and the number of pieces of the weft linear materials 20a supplied, the diameter and the number of rotation of the winding drum 22, and the diameter and the feed speed of the winding core 11, but may be determined to the range from lOm to 15m at largest. Accordingly, the product according to the present invention can be used without any hindrance in producing common hollow bodies. The winding disk 21 and the winding drum 22 may be constructed in any of the relationships shown in Figs. llA to llC, the concrete construction will be described in detail below. The embodiment shown in Figs. 22 and 23 corresponds to the construction shown in Fig. llA. That is, the winding disk 21 and the winding drum 22 are formed integrally with each other and supported rotatably with respect to a support frame 29 by a slide ring 221. The winding core 11 is inserted through the central holes of the winding disk 21 and the winding drum 22 and is supported against contact therewith. A disk 271 of the drive mechanism 27 is in frictional contact with the outer peripheral surface of the winding disk 21. The weft linear material 20a passes through any one of R plurality of the guides 26 provided in the support frame 29, turns around the outer peripheral surface of the winding drum 22, passes through the guide hole 211 provided in the winding disk 21, and is fixed in the leading end thereof to an arbitrary position on the winding core 11. The winding operation in this embodiment is the same as that described above in relation to Fig. 10. The embodiment shown in Figs. 24 and 25 corresponds to the construction of Fig. 113. The winding disk 21 and the winding drum 22 are connected relatively rotatably through conventional roller bearings 222. The winding drum 22 is supported rotatably with respect to the support frame 29 through the roller bearings 222. The winding disk 21 is serrated on the outer periphery thereof for engagement with idle gears 223 and a driving gear 272 of the drive mechanism 27. The winding disk 21 is supported by the idle gears 223 rotatably at a predetermined position and is rotatably driven by the driving gear 272. The embodiment shown in Fig. 26 corresponds to the construction of Fig. llC. The winding drum 22 is supported fixedly by the support frame 29. The winding disk 21 is connected rotatably with respect to the winding drum 22 through the roller bearings 222. A pulley 225 is fixed to the side of the winding disk 21 and is connected to a driving pulley 273 of the driving mechanism 27 through a belt 274. The winding disk 21 is supported rotatably at a predetermined position by a roller 226 and is rotatably driven by the driving pulley 273. The system for rotatably driving the winding disk 21 is not specifically limited to the embodiments described above but may be interchangeable as required. In the case where the winding disk 21 and the winding drum 22 are formed integrally with each other, the guide hole 211 may be provided directly at the forward end of the winding drum 22 as shown in Fig. 27, without forming the winding disk 21 specifically. By this construction, the winding angle of the winding on the winding core 11 can be reduced. This construction provides satisfactory effects particularly when disposed on the upstream side of a plurality of the winders as shown in Fig. 12B or 19. The winding sometimes becomes loose during reverse rotation of the winding disk 21. An example of the mechanism for preventing loosening of the winding is shown in Fig. 28. In this mechanism, the winding disk 21 and the winding drum 22 are connected relatively rotatably, and a pair of coil springs 231 are interposed between them so that a reaction force is transmitted to the winding drum 22 through the springs 231 during the reverse rotation of the winding disk 21. For smooth relative sliding between the winding drum 22 and the winding thereon, it is effective to attach rollers 232 rotatably along the outer peripheral surface of the winding drum 22 as shown in Fig. 29. A linear material guide mechanism is shown in Fig. 30.A characteristic feature of the present invention resides in that the rotating elements can be formed light in weight and small in size, thereby making it possible to wind a number of pieces of the weft linear materials simultaneously around the winding core 11. In this case, as shown in Fig. 30, the bobbins 23a having the weft linear materials 20a wound therearound are arranged together at one place and the weft linear materials 20a payed out from the bobbins 23a are directed through respective guide pipes 261 to the respective guides 26 provided in the supported frame 29. By this arrangement, it is made possible to make efficient use of the limited space and to guide a number of the weft linear materials surely and without confusion. The similar construction may be applied to guide the warp linear materials. According to the present invention, mechanical strength of the compound is considerably increased because the linear materials are not woven, and production cost is reduced by approximately 40 as compared with the conventional method by continuation and automation of the steps. Industrial Applicability The method and the apparatus according to the present invention achieve the most noticeable effects when applied particularly to a continuous production line of reinforced synthetic. resin articles.
