# Electrostatic precipitator having means for dampening the swaying of its discharge electrodes.

## Abstract
A wet electrostatic precipitator includes flat dis charge electrodes 14 of a grid like construction that have some flexibility so that if sparking occurs between their freely suspended lower ends and adjacent collector plates, the lower ends will tend to sway back and forth Oscillation dampener devices 50 are suspended upon the lower ends of the discharge electrodes 14 and are comprised of a cylindrical moss or body portion 82 rigidly connected to a rail portion 80 by arms 84 . Each dampener is pendulously suspended upon a cross member 56 of a frame of the associated electrode so that its rail portion 80 rubs against the cross member with enough friction to rapidly inhibit swaying of the lower end of the electrode under the influence of spark ing.
