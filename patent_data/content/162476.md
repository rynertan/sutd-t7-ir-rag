# DRY FORMING OF RECONSTITUTED TOBACCO AND RESULTING PRODUCT

## Abstract
An improved method of making reconstituted tobacco using a dry forming process. Fiberized tobacco stems and scrap are combined with tobacco material of a fine particle size. The resulting tobacco mixture is conveyed in an air stream and deposited on a moving foraminous surface. An adhesive is incorporated into or applied to the web bonding the tobacco particles into a coherent sheet, and the sheet is dried if necessary. The dried sheet may be divided into lea flets or shredded for further processing as reconstituted to bacco. In preferred embodiments, cellulose fibers are mixed with the tobacco particles prior to web formation to impart increased sheet strength. In a further embodiment tobacco fines are mixed with the adhesive and applied to the web in the adhesive composition. Results obtained by means of the present invention include cost savings particularly in terms of reduced capital costs. Because the tobacco is used sub stantially in its natural state, the aroma and other desirable tobacco attributes are retained.
