# Thermal relay.

## Abstract
A thermal relay construction capable of operating a pair of electrical contacts. The thermal relay includes an electrical heater of the self regulating PTC type which is mounted upon and thermally coupled directly to a bimetal snap disc so that heat generated by the heater causes the bimetal snap disc to overcenter and operate the electrical contacts. The other electrical connection to the heater is made through a compensating blade which bears against the heater to compensate for ambient temperature effects on the thermal relay. An electric range oven control uses temperature sensitive electrical contacts in conjunction with the thermal relay to control the oven heaters.
