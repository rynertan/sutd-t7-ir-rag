# Process for the preparation of 2 benzimidazolecarbamic acid esters.

## Abstract
2 Benzimidazole carbamate compounds known as useful for combating parasitic infestures are made by an improved sequential process including a thiocyanating o nitroaniline, b alkylating the thiocyanate this prepared, c reducing the nitro group in the product from b , and d condensing an alkylthio o phenylenediamine with an alkyl cyano carbamate or alkali or alkaline earth metal salt thereof , to provide the desired products.
