# New dye releasing compounds and their use in photographic silver halide colour materials for the production of colour images by a dye diffusion transfer process.

## Abstract
A photographic silver halide material comprises a shifted dye compound capable of releasing a dye moiety, characterized in that said compound corresponds in reduced state to general formula 1 and in oxidized state to general formula 2 A¹ L P 1 A² L P 2 wherein A¹ represents a hydroquinonyl group including a substi tuted hydroquinonyl group, or such group forming part of a fused ring system, A² represents a quinonyl group including a substituted quinonyl group, or such group forming part of a fused ring system, L represents a bivalent group which undergoes a cleavage under hydrolytic alkaline conditions when the compound is in reduced state corresponding to formula 1 , P represents an organic dye moiety incorporating an azo chromophoric group N N linked through a conjugated bond system to an electron withdrawing group being a monoester oxalyl group O OR wherein R represents an organic group, that can be intro duced by esterification of a carboxylic acid group, said monoester oxalyl group being removable by hydrolysis resulting in a residual auxochromic hydroxyl OH group.
