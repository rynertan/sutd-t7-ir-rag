# Process for ultra drying of a gas.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a process for ultra drying of a gas or a gas mixture by bringing this into contact with a silicate containing material. In order to obtain a residual water level of 5 ppb or less, the invention is characterized in that the gas or gas mixture is brought into contact with a silicate containing material, preferably a zeolite or silicagel, that has been modified with silane, borane, and or the alkyl and or halogen substituted compounds thereof. The invention is further concerned with the separation of tritium oxide from gas mixtures preferably with water.
