# Discrete flow type automated chemical analytic apparatus.

## Abstract
A discrete type automated chemical analytic apparatus, wherein a carrier member 70 reciprocatable in parallel with a reaction line 14 constituted by those of the reaction tubes linearly arranged on an endless belt 10 which are set on the top run 10a of the endless belt 10 supports two reagent pipetting nozzles 58, 59 in a vertically movable state. The corresponding reagent containers 22, 23 are disposed on an extension of the reaction line. The nozzles 58, 59 through which the reagent is sucked from the reagent containers 22, 23 pipette the sucked reagent into the corresponding reaction tubes at predetermined points on the reaction line 14 in accordance with the movement of the carrier member 70 . The specimen discharge mechanism 27 includes a nozzle 34 for pipetting a specimen at a prescribed point on the reaction line 14 .
