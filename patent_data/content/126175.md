The aperture of upper end of main cylinder is formed at the exhaust hole 16 connected to the discharge path 34 and the aperture at the lower end of main cylinder is engaged with the upper part of the plunger 41 for air cylinder explained later. The connecting pipe member 18 is urged upward by the spring 30 provided within the cylinder 5. 32 is the depressing head and the discharge valve hole 33 is opened at the center of lower surface and it is connected to the nozzle hole 35 opening at the side of upper part from said discharge valve hole through the exhaust path 34. In addition, from the lower surface of depressing head surrounding the discharge valve hole 33, the larger diameter cylinder 36 larger than said cylinder is provided vertically, said large diarneter piston 24 is engaged with inside of said cylinder, and the top end of discharge valve body 23 is engaged with the inside of exhaust valve hole, thereby the discharge valve 37 is formed.The large diameter cylinder 36 is engaged with inside of said inner engaging cylinder and the projected passage 38 provided at the outer circumference of lower end of large diameter cylinder is engaged with the engaging passage 13 of inner engaging cylinder.

In above structure, when the operating member 17 is depressed, for the first time, through the depress ing head 32, since both pressure chamber A which is formed by the internal spaces of cylinder located lower than the piston 25 of which lower part is formed cylindrically and the outer cylinder 22 is connected to the pressure chamber B which is formed by the space of largediameter cylinder located higher than the large diameter piston 24 through the through hole 27 and vertical groove 28 because both suction valve and discharge valve are closed, the pump chamber consisting of these pressure chambers is pressurized.When the pump chamber is further pressurized, the connecting pipe member 18 moves downward farther for the depressing head 32 owing to difference of diameters of both cylinders, and thereby the discharge valve 37 opens and the liquid in the pump chamber is sprayed from the nozzle hole. In the first experience of use of sprayer, the air existing in the pump chamber is sprayed. Since the operating member 17 moves downward during spraying operation with the exahust valve 37 being opened, the air cylinder chamber 29 also moves downward and thereby the pluger 41 for air cylinder is inserted into the air cylinder chamber 29, causing the air in said chamber to be sprayed through the discharge valve hole 33. When downward movement of the operating member 17 stops, the disc iar9te valve 37 closes owing to a depressing force of the spring 30, and when the depressing head is released, the operating member 17 novels upward.Since the pump chamber is pressurized negatively, the suction valve 6 opens, sucking the liquid in the container, and in addition, since the air cylinder chamber is also pressurized negatively, external air is sucked through the nozzle hole, discharge path and discharge valve hole.. Since the liquid is already sucked in the pump chamber, it is sprayed by the next depressing of operating member, and the liquid adhered to tie inside wall of nozzle hole by the spraying operation is removed by the suction of external air effectuated when the operating member moves upward. The embodiments shown in Fig. 2 to Fig.4 indicate the structure wherein both plunger 41 for air cylinder and air cylinder chamber 29 are provided to the sprayers in different structures, respectively. In the preferred embodiment shown in Fig.2, the lower part of cylinder 5 is formed as the small diameter cylinder 31, while the upper part is formed as the largediameter cylinder 36. Inside of the small diameter cylinder 31 engages with the small diameter piston 18a provided at the lower end of connecting pipe member 18.From the depressing head 32, the discharge pipe 51 of which lower part is formed as the large diameter part is extended vertically, and inside of large diameter part engages with the cylinder material 53 with large diameter cylindrical piston 52, this large diameter cylindrical piston engages with inside of large diameter cylinder 36, and moreover inside of large diameter cylinder 36 engages with the large diameter piston 24 provided to the con necking pipe member 18. To the large diameter piston 24, pressure of pressure chamber B works downward, while to the small diameter piston 18a, pressure of pressure chamber B works upward. The projected passage 54 formed at the inside of upper end of cicumferential wall of cylinder material 53 is provided with the discharge valve hole which is connected to the discharge pipe Sla, and the discharge valve 37 is composed of said valve hole and discharsevalve body 23 at the upper end of the connecting pipe member 18. The pressure chamber B is formed with said large diameter cylindrical piston 52, large diameter piston 24 provided at the intermediate part of connecting pipe member, inside wall of large diameter cylinder provided between them and the external wall of connecting pipe. The air cylinder chamber 29 is formed within the connecting pipe member 18 and the plunger 41 for air cylinder passes through said connecting pipe member 18.At the upper end of connecting pipe member 18, the exahust hole 16 is bored so that when the plunger 41 for air cylinder moves upward within the connecting pipe member 18, air is sent to the nozzle hole 35. At the internal circumferential surface of upper part of the connecting pipe member 18, the annular projected passage 18b is formed and it is water tightly in contact with inside of plunger 41 for air cylinder. In this embodiment, when the operating member 17 is depressedthroughthedepressing head 32, the pump chamber 4 consisting of the pressure chamber A and pressure chamberB connected through the hole 55 is pressurized as in the case of the first embodiment, and thereby the connecting pipe member 18 moves downward owing to difference of diameters of both cylinders 5, 36, causing the discharge valve 37 to open. Accordingly, the liquid and air are sprayed from the nozzle hole 35. Downward movement of operating member causes the plunger 41 for air cylinder to enter the discharge Pipe hole which is also used in common by the air cylinder chamber 29. When downward movement of operating member stops, the discharge valve 37 closes.Meanwhile, when the operating member moves upward, the suction valve 6 opens and the liquid enters the pump chamber. Simultaneously, the vertical part of di charge path, namely the cylinder chamber is negatively pressurized and thereby external air is sucked through the nozzle hole. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 3, the upper half of cylinder is formed as the large diameter cylinder 36. The external surface of lower end of the discharge pipe 51 extended vertically from the depressing head 32 is provided with the large diameter piston 24 and the external surface of lower part of the connecting pipe member 18 is provided with the cylindrical piston 25 which is in contact with the internal wall of cylinder.The upper part of connecting pipe member 18 is inserted into the lower part of discha we Dispe 51, and the discharge valve 37 is formed by the discharge valve body 23 formed.at the upper end of connecting pipe member 18 and the dis charge valve hole 33 formed by the downward step portion formed at the intermediate part of discharge pipe hole Sla. The suction valve 6 is formed by the valve hole 6a pro vided.at the intermediate part of connecting pipe and the elastic cylinder 6b engaging with the external surface of connected pipe in such a manner as choking said valve hole. In said third embodiment, when the operating member 17 is depressed, the liquid in the large diameter cylinder 36 enters, due to downward movement of the large diameter piston 24, narrow clearance formed by the cylinder 5, external surface of connecting pipe member 18 and the cylindrical piston 25, causing the connecting pipe member 18 to be depressed, and thereby the djschargevalve 37 opens. When downward movement of operating member 17 stops, the discharge valve closes, and when the depressing head is released, the operating member moves upward.Thereby, the pump chamber is mainly formed by the internal space of large diameter cylinder and is negatively pressurized. Accordingly, the liquid in the container flows into the pump chamber through the suction valve 6.The air cylinder chamber 29 is formed by the internal space of upper part of the connecting pipe and the internal space of discharse pipe hole Sla located hiqher than the discharge valve hole 33, and external air is sucked into the air cylinder throuah the nozzle hole and inside air is exhausted in accordance with relative ascent and descent of plunger 41 for air cylinder into from the air cylinder chamber 29 during vertical movement of the operating member. The embodiment shown in Pig.4, a large diameter cylinder is not used. From the depressing head 32, the discharge pipe 51 of which lower half is formed as the large diameter part 56 is extended vertically and the lower end of said large diameter part is provided with the cylindrical piston 25. The inside of large diameter part is working as the air cylinder chamber 29. The plunger 41 for air cylinder is formed cylindrically with both ends opened as the apertures, forming the discharge valve 37 consisting of the discharge valve hole and ball valve within the upper end thereof, and the upper end of said plunger 41 is water tightly inserted into the lower part of air cylinder chamber. Downward movement of operating member 17 makes the plunger 41 for air cylinder relatively move upward within the air cylinder chamber 29 and simultaneously the cylindrical piston 25 move downward within the cylinder 5. Therefore, the liquid stored in the clearance formed between the external surface of air cylinder plunger and the cylinder wall enters the hole of said plunqer passing the through hole 57 at the lower end of air cylinder plunger 41. Thereby, the discharge valve 37 opens and the liquid is sprayed from the nozzle hole 35 through the exhaust path 34. When downward movement of operating member 17 stops, the discharge valve closes and when said operating member 17 moves upward, the suction valve opens and the liquid in the container is sucked. Simultaneously, the air cylinder plunger 41 moves backward in the air cylinder chamber 29 keeping the water tight sealing.Thereby, the chmber becomes broad, negatively pressurizing therein. Thus, external air is sucked through the nozzle hole 35. With above mentioned structure, the present invention offers a sprayer wherein the liquid is sucked into the pump chamber from the container loading the cylinder in accordance with upward and downward movements of the operating means erected from the cylinder and is sprayed from the nozzle hole of depressing head formed at the upper end of the operating member, thus characterized in that external air is sucked through the nozzle hole when the operating member moves upward in order to suck the liquid in the container, accordingly the liquid adhered to the inside wall of nozzle hole in each spraying operation can be removed, preventing that a substance precipitated after the liquid is dried up and to be dissolved into the spraying liquid is fixed on the inside wall of nozzle hole and thereby the nozzle hole is choked.
