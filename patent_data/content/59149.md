# Time division multiplex switching network for multiservice digital networks.

## Abstract
Asynchronous time division multiplex switching network for multiservice digital network. It comprises a plurality of time division multiplex bidirectional highways, a plurality of data transmit and recieve stations connected to and associated with said bidirectional highways and a plurality of buses connecting these stations therebetween. The highways convey digital data arranged in a hybrid frame including a time slot part formed of a plurality of time slots containing sample words having a variable number of bits and a packet channel part formed of a plurality of channels for packets having a variable number of bits. Means are provided in each transmit station for converting the sample words into the time slot part and the packets in the packet channel part into a message including the sample word proper, its number of bits, the address of the terminating highway, the number of the time slot in the hybrid frame and a first indicator marking the sample words and, the packet proper, its number of bits, the address of the terminating highway, the number of the packet channel in the hybrid frame and a second indicator marking the packets. The messages are then transmitted and in the receive station, the items added to form the messages are deleted, leaving only the sample words and packets.
