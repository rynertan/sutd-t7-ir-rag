# Reactive medium for electrochromic display devices and electrochromic display including such reactive medium.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a composition for use as a reactive medium in a reversible electrochromic display device. The reactive medium is placed between two electrically conductive electrodes of the device, at least one of the electrodes being transparent, the composition includes an anhydrous solvent and an oxidant reductant pair in which the reductant is an electron acceptor, and the oxidant is a substituted fluorene compound.
