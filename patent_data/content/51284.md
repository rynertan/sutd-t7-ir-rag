# Novel thiaprostaglandin E1 derivatives, process for production thereof, and pharmaceuticals containing these compounds.

## Abstract
A novel compound selected from the group consisting of 7 or6 or 4 thiaprostaglandin E₁ derivatives of the formula I . A 7 thiaprostaglandin E₁ derivatives and or its optical isomer may be prepared by reacting a 2 organo 2 cyclo pentenone II with an organic copper lithium compound III to effect conjugation reaction. A 6 thiaprostaglandin E₁ derivative and or its optical isomer may be prepared by subjecting an α β unsaturated ketone IV and a thiol V to the Michael addition reaction. And 4 thiaprostaglandin derivative and or its optical isomer may also be prepared by the Michael addition reaction from a 2 allyl substituted cyclopentanone VI and a thio VIII . Some compounds I 1 amongst the compounds of the formula I and or their optical isomer are useful for controll ing vascular actions such as angina pectoris, vasodilation etc.
