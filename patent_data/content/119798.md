# Process for preparing a single oxide crystal.

## Abstract
A process for preparing a single oxide crystal comprising the steps of mixing to fuse raw materials for crystal growth and a flux, cooling the fused mixture slowly to grow and pre cipitate a single crystal, and dipping up said single crystal from the molten flux while said flux is molten. A substitution amount of the substituted element in the grown crystal can be controlled. The crystal thus obtained is of high quality with little cracks.
