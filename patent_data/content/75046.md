# Line printers.

## Abstract
In an electro optic line printer having a light valve 12 comprising an electro optic element with a plurality of in dividually addressable electrodes 18 , sample and hold circuits 42 maintain the data samples for each line of an image on the electrodes for essentially a full line printing time to increase the exposure contrast. A multiplexer may be used to ripple the data samples of a serial data stream onto the electrodes, and the polarity of the data samples applied to the electrodes may be occasionally reversed to prevent optical damage to the electro optic element. More over, a pair of longitudinally displaced and laterally stag gered electrode arrays may be used in light valves which rely on fringe fields to avoid electrode aligned blind spots.
