# KEYLESS ACCESS CONTROL AND SECURITY SYSTEM

## Abstract
A keyless access control and security system especially adapted for use with an automobile comprises a piezoelectric permutation touchpad unit which can be affixed, without re quiring bodywork, to the outside of the vehicle s door in the key cylinder aperture. The touchpad is illuminated when touched and is therefore usable in the dark. The person seek ing access must enter the correct access code combination on the touchpad to open the door and or the trunk. The touch pad is connected to a remotely located logic circuit which controls access. The circuit provides for a signal of low in tensity, indicating that a correction in the code entered into the touchpad should be made and, after a time delay, an alarm of high intensity, if no correction is made. Upon acti vation of the alarm, the headlights are flashed, the horn is sounded, or both. In order to enable a parking attendant, repairman, or some other authorized person to have access to the automobile without revealing the access code, the logic circuit can be programmed, by operation of the touchpad, using the proper access code and a further secondary code, arbitrarily selected, to provide access to the automobile in response to the secondary code, which later can be erased.
