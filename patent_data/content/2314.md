# Separation of phenol.

## Abstract
Phenol is separated from mixtures comprising phenol and cumene and or α methylstyrene by distillation in the presence of water in a column to which cumene and or α methylstyrene and water are fed as reflux in quantities sufficient to produce two liquid phases in the upper part of the column.

## Description
SeParation of Phenol THIS INVENTION relates to the separation of phenol. Phenol is commonly manufactured from. cumene by oxidising the cumene to cumene hydroperoxide and decomposing the cumene hydroperoxide to phenol and acetone. In processes for manufacturing phenol of this type streams may be produced comprising phenol together with cumene and or a methylstyrene. Cumene may be recovered and re used in the grocess and a methylstyrene may also be recovered and re used in the process after reduction to cumene. This invention comprises a process of separating phenol from a mixture comprising phenol and cumene and or a methylstyrene which comprises distilling the mixture in the presence of water in a distillation column, feeding to the top of the column a reflux comprising cumene and or a methylstyrene and also water in quantities sufficient to produce two liquid phases in the upper part of the distillation column and recovering phenol from the base of the column and cumene and or a methylstyrene and water from the top of the column. The cumene and or a methylstyrene and water recovered from the top of the column separate on condensation into two liquid phases. It is preferred that at least part of the water fed to the top of the column should be from the water rich phase produced by this çotitier. ation the cumene and or a methylstyrene may be supplied from the cumene and or a methylstyrene rich phase .rom the condensation. Water may be present in the mixture when it is fed to the column. If desired water may also be fed preferably in the form of steam into a part of the column below that at which the mixture is fed. The mixture fed to the column may comprise 20 95 and preferably 50 95 by weight of phenol, 10 40 and preferably 15 3046 by weight of cumene and or a methylstyrene and 1 60 and more preferably 5 20 by weight of water. The process is particularly suitable for separating mixtures containing high molar ratio of cumene to a methyl st ene, for example greater than 3 to 1, but may be used at advantageously at any ratio of cumene to a methylstyrene. The total water fed to the column as steam, with the reflux and as a component of the mixture fed to the column will bear the same ratio to the total of cumene ald or a methylstyrene fed to the column as reflux and in the mixture as does the water to the cumene and or a methylstyrene taken as overhead vapour from the columnThis ratio will correspond to the composition of the heteroazeotrope of water with cumene and or a methylstyrene and is approximately 44 by weight of water and 56, by weight of cumene and or a methylstyrene if the distillation is conducted at substantially atmospheric pressure. Suitably the ratio by weight of cumene and or a methylstyrene to water fed to the top of the column is in the range 1 2 to 9 1 and is more preferably 2 3 to 9 1.These ratios may be adjusted in accordance with the desired reflux ratio and the amounts of water and cumene and or a methylstyrene introduced with the mixture and as steam. The composition of the heteroazeotrope of water with cumene and or a methylstyrene varies little with pressure. It is preferred that the distillation should be carried out at a pressure in the range 0.1 50 bars absolute and more preferably 0.2 10 bars absolute. The column suitably comprise 20 100 theoretical plates and the molar reflux ratio ma be for example in the range 0.2 to 10 and is preferably in the range 1 to 5.EXAMPLE 1 A mixture comprising 78 2 by weight phenol, 14.1 by weight cumene, 2.0 by weight a methylstyrene and 7.9 by weight water was fed at a tem l.rature of 60 700C to a glass Oldershaw column with 100 a ual plates approximately 50 theorectical plates , at the ac .al plate 40 from the bottom of the column. The pressure at the top of the column was 1 atmosphere and distillation was carried out a reflux ratio of 3.0 on a molar basi The overheads from the column re condensed to a two phase mixture. If the organic phase from the condensate only was used as reflux the phenol ntent of the organic layer of the top product was approximately 5.4 by weight and that of the aqueous layer 2 by weight.The phenol recovered as a bottoms product cm the column contained 6 parts per million by weight of ne and 5 parts per.million by weight of a alpha methylsty e. When the reflux was 6.5 moles of the aqueous phase to one mole of the organic phase the phe content of the organic layer of the top product s 0.7 by weight and that of the aqueous layer 0.5 by right.The phenol recovered as a bottoms product contained 4 parts per million by weight cumene and 3 parts per million by weight of a methylstyrene. EXAMPLE 2 A mixture comprising 67 by weight phenol 2 7 by weight cumene, 3.8 by weight a methylstyrene , d 5 by weight water was fed at a temperature of 60 7CtC to glass Oldershaw column with 100 actual plates apiroximtely 50 theoretical plates , at the actual plate 40 fr the bottom of the column. The pressure at the top of the cc mn was 1 atmosphere.Distillation was carried out at Bnn over all reflux ratio of 4.8 on a molar basis and the rE ux contained a ratio of 7.6 moles of the aqueous phase f the condensate to one mole of the organic phase. ir phenol content of the organic layer of the top product was 0.03 by weight and that of the aqueous layer 0.0 ty weight. The phenol recovered as a bottoms product contained 3 parts per million by weight cumene and 43 parts per million by weight of a methylstyrene. XAM2LE 3 A mixture comprising 67 by weight phenol, 22.796 by weight cumene, 3.8 by weight a methylstyrene and 6.5 by weight water was fed at a temperature of 60 700C to a 2 inch diameter glass column packed with Knitmesh packing. The total height of the packing was 119.5 inches with 39.5 inches below the point of entry of the mixture. The pressure at the top of the column was 1 atmosphere.Distillation was carried out an an overall reflux ratio of 2.2 on a molar basis and the reflux contained a ratio of 9.6 moles of the aqueous phase of the condensate to one mole of the organic phase. The phenol content of the organic layer of the top product was 0.25 by weight and that of the aqueous layer 0.2 by weight. The phenol recovered as a bottoms product contained 18 parts per million by weight cumene and 53 parts per million by weight a methylstyrene. Liquid aqueous layer which separates from the condensate is substantially free from a methyl styrene and cumene and the organic layer is substantially free from water in each of the above examples.
