# METHOD AND DEVICE FOR DETERMINING THE POSITION OF AN OBJECT IN CONNECTION WITH ROBOT EQUIPMENT

## Abstract
Method and device for determining the position of an object in connection with robot equipment, whereby at least one camera support by the robot is used. The camera pro vides a two dimensional image of a region CF1 of the surface of the object. On the basis of a light source mechanically connected to the camera, a line 20 or a different pattern is projected on the surface of the object, the emitted light mak ing a fixed angle with the optical axis of the camera. On the basis of the position in the image of the projected line 20 in a first direction B B , a measure z₁ is calculated of the distance of the object from the camera. On the basis of the position in the image in a second direction of a distortion 21 of the projected line, which is caused by a characteristic part of the object, a measure x₁ is calculated of the position of said characteristic part.
