# Electrical insulator.

## Abstract
The invention provides an electrical insulator comprising a cylindrical core 2 of an insulating refractory material, such as porcelain, on to a portion of the curved surface of which a sleeve 8 of insulating polymeric material is fitted. Metal end caps 4 , for electrically connecting the insulator, are fit ted to the ends of the porcelain core such that there is an exposed portion 10 of the curved surface of the core bet ween the sleeve and each end cap. Thus, any damaging elec trical activity which takes place at the metal end caps is directed primarily on to the surface of the procelain core 2 , and not on to the surface of the electrically vulnerable polymeric sleeve 8 , which serves to protect mechanically the relatively brittle porcelain core. Optionally, the polymeric sleeve 8 may have a convo luted or a shedded outer surface 12 to increase the leakage path length of the insulator, or to prevent the formation of a continuous moisture path, or both.
