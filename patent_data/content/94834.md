# Methods and apparatus for rapid and accurate frequency syntonization of an atomic clock.

## Abstract
Methods and apparatus for rapidly and automatically syntonizing the frequency of a passive atomic resonator 12 of an atomic clock with a reference frequency which corresponds to the frequency of an external reference signal 58 . Any difference between the hyperfine transition fre quency of the resonator and the reference frequency gener ates an error signal which is used as a basis for automatically determining the magnitude of a quantity which adjusts the actual hyperfine transition frequency of the resonator.
