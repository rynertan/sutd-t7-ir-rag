# Apparatus for attaching bottom stops to a slide fastener chain.

## Abstract
A method of attaching bottom stops 2 of a generally H shaped cross section to a slide fastener chain 1 . One of successive spaced pairs of opposed blank tape portions 7, 7 of the fastener chain 1 is spread apart. A bottom stop 2 , which has two pairs of gripping legs 9, 9 and 9, 9 , is placed between the spread pair of opposed blank tape portions 7, 7 . The spread pair of opposed blank tape portions 7, 7 is then released and thereby allowed to come toward each other until a pair of opposed blank beaded tape edges 8, 8 is threaded one through a space between each pair of the gripping legs 9, 9 of the bottom stop 2 . Then, the blank beaded tape edges 8, 8 are compressed against the bottom stop 2 on opposite sides. Finally, the gripping legs 9, 9 of each pair are clinched about the compressed beaded edge 8 of a respective one of the stringer tapes 6 . An apparatus 3 for carrying out this method is also disclosed.
