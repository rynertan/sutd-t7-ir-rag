# Method and apparatus for supervising charges in blast furnace.

## Abstract
A technique for supervising a descending speed, thick ness of a layer, particle size, and so on of charges in a blast furnace. Coke and ore composing the charges are detected by radiating an electromagnetic wave into the blast furnace. The supervision is utilizing the fact that an electromagnetic wave can easily pass through coke, but is reflected or scattered by ore.
