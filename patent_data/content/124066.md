# Acidic mixed oxide catalytic dealkylation to produce 1,4 butanediol and tetrahydrofuran.

## Abstract
A coproduct continuous dealkylation process is de scribed in which 4 t butoxy n butanol is contacted with acidic silica alumina catalyst at temperatures in the 160 200 C range reactor wall temperature in the liquid hourly space velocity regime of 2 0 to 6 0 liter liter catalyst hr. to produce in a single reactor a mixture in which the ultimate product of conversion of the 4 t butoxy n butanol is 1,4 butanediol 1,4 diol and tet rahydrofuran THF present in a preselected ratio mole of 1,4 diol to THF ranging from 7 3 to 3 7. The 1,4 diol produced is useful in the preparation of polyesters, e.g. polybutylene ter ephthalates, and THF is a useful intermediate in the manufac ture of certain chemicals and plastics.
