## Description
PYRIMIDINONE DERIVATIVES This invention relates to pyrimidinone derivatives, to processes for their preparation, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them. European Patent Applications PublicationNos. 56319 and 87326 disclose 5 halo pyrimidin2 ones which possess a metaphase arresting ability.This ability is useful for combating abnormal cell proliferation, which can be found in auto immune diseases, and diseases such as cancers, leukaemias or cutaneous cellular proliferation, e.g. contact dermatitis or psoriasis. We have found a new group of pyrimidin 2one derivatives which have very good metaphase arresting ability and which are useful in combating abnormal cell proliferation. In general, these compounds possess good water solubility and by virtue of this are particularly easy to administer. In particular, we have found that 4 and or 6unsubstituted 5 halo pyrimidin 2 ones according to the European Patent Applications referred to above are capable of forming bisulphite adducts having metaphase arresting abilities and enhanced water solubilities. According to one preferred aspect of the present invention we provide compounds being bisulphite adducts of compounds of formula I EMI2.1 wherein R represents a group Rê CH X CR4R5 nR R1 represents a halogen atom or a trifluoromethyl group R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a C1 4 alkyl, C1 4 alkanoyl or phenyl group C1 4 X represents an oxygen or a sulphur atom or a group NR6, where R6 represents a formyl, C1 4 alkanoyl or C14 alkoxycarbonyl group R3 represents a C6 10 carbocyclic aromatic group or a heterocyclic group containing a 5 or 6 membered unsaturated heterocyclic ring which ring contains one or more heteroatoms selected from 0, N and S and optionally carries a fused carbocyclic ring, which carbocyclic or heterocyclic group may carry one or more substituents selected from halogen atoms, C1 4 alkyl, C1 4 alkanoyl, C1 4 alkoxy, C1 4 alkoxycarbonyl, C1 4 alkylthio, hydroxyl, nitro, cyano and formyl groups, NR7R8 groups where R7 is a hydrogen atom or a C1 4 alkyl group, and R8 is a hydrogen atom or a C1 4 alkyl, C1 4 alkanoyl or aroyl group and C1 4 alkyl groups substituted by one or more hydroxy or NR7R8 groups and halogen atoms n is an integer having the value 0 or 1 and R and R5, which may be the same or different, each is a hydrogen atom or a C1 6 alkyl group and salts of such adducts. The adducts according to the invention are sulphonates and are thus ionic materials capable of salt formation. Such salts are conveniently physiologically acceptable, water soluble salts and may advantageously be sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium or trialkylammonium salts. The adducts of the invention are conveniently formed directly through an addition reaction, however the term adduct is used herein to refer to the final product irrespective of its manner of production and thus includes within its scope compounds produced other than by direct bisulphite addition to compounds of formula I. Thus in a further aspect of the invention we provide compounds of formula IIEMI3.1 wherein X represents the groupEMI3.2 M represents a cation, preferably selected from sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium and trialkylammonium and R and R1 are as defined above and salts thereof, separately or in admixture. The compounds of formula II may be substituted at the 4 or 6 position having the formula IIa or IIb EMI4.1 In the above definitions of the compounds according to the invention, the term halogen is used to mean fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. The group R2 may be for example a methyl, ethyl, acetyl or phenyl group, but advantageously represents a hydrogen atom. X may for example represent a group ,NR in which R6 is a formyl, acetyl or ethoxycarbonyl group, but X advantageously represents an oxygen or sulphur atom. Examples of the 6 10 carbocyclic aromatic groups within the definition of the group R3 are phenyl or naphthyl groups which may be substituted by the groups indicated above. Examples of the optional substituents which may be present on a phenyl or naphthyl group include one, two or more chlorine or fluorine atoms, or methyl, acetyl, methoxy, methoxycarbonyl, methylthio, hydroxyl, nitro, cyano, formyl, NR2, or hydroxymethyl groups. Substituents on the phenyl group may be present, for example, in the 2 , 3 and or 4 positions. R may alternatively be a five or six membered unsaturated heterocyclic ring which may contain up to four, preferably 1, 2 or 3,hetero atoms.Such heterocyclic rings include pyrimidinyl and imidazolyl rings, e.g. the pyrimidin 2 yl and imidazol 2 yl rings. The five or six membered unsaturated heterocyclic ring may have another ring, fused to it, which may be a carbocyclic ring such as phenyl. Examples of the substituents which optionally may be present on the heterocyclic ring, or on any fused ring, are halogen atoms such as chlorine atoms or C14 alkyl groups e.g. methyl groups. R4 and R5 may each represent a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, but preferably each represents a hydrogen atom. Examples of the group R include Rê CH X R and CH2XCH2R , where Rê is a hydrogen atom or a phenyl group, X is an oxygen or sulphur atom and R3 is a phenyl group optionally substituted by one or two chlorine atoms, or a methyl, acetyl, methoxy, methoxycarbonyl, nitro, cyano or formyl group or a naphthyl group and CH2NR6R3, whereR6 is an ethoxycarbonyl group and R3 is a phenyl group. Compounds of formula IIa are particularly interesting. When the. cation M in formulae IIa or IIb is a trialkylammonium ion the alkyl groups conveniently contain up to 4 carbon atoms and such a group may be for example a triethylammonium cation. Preferably, however, M is a sodium ion. Preferred compounds of the present invention include the sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium or trialkylammonium salts of the bisulphite adducts of the compounds of formula I in which R1 represents a chlorine atom and R represents the groupEMI5.1 wherein R2 is a hydrogen atom or a phenyl group,X is an oxygen or sulphur atom and R3 is a phenyl group optionally substituted by one or two chlorine atoms, or a methyl, acetyl, methoxy, methoxycarbonyl, nitro, cyano or formyl group or a naphthyl group or the group CR2NR6R3, where R6 is an ethoxycarbonyl group and R3 is a phenyl group. Particularly interesting compounds include those of formula IIa and IIb in which M is a sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium or trialkylammonium ion, preferably a sodium, potassium, ammonium or trialkylammonium ion, especially a sodium ion RÚ is a chlorine atom and R is a group Rê CH X CH2 nR3, where Rê is a hydrogen atom or a phenyl group, n is 0 or 1,X is an oxygen or sulphur atom and R3 is a phenyl or naphthyl group, optionally substituted by one or two chlorine atoms or a methyl, acetyl, methoxy, methoxycarbonyl, nitro, cyano or formyl group or n is O, X is the group NR6, where R6 is an ethoxycarbonyl group, and R is a phenyl group. Particularly preferred compounds of this type are those of formula Ila or lIb, especially formula IIa, in which M is a sodium ion, RÚ is a chlorine atom and R is a group CH2OR , where R is a phenyl group substituted, preferably in the 4 position, by a formyl or acetyl group b a group CH2OCH2R ,where R is a phenyl group substituted, preferably in the 4 position, by a methoxy or methoxycarbonyl group or c a group CH2NR6R , where R6 is ethoxycarbonyl and R3 is phenyl. particularly interesting compounds according to the invention include the following sodium 5 chloro 1 4 formylphenoxy methyl 2 oxo1,2,3,4 tetrahydropyrimidine 4 sulphonate sodium 5 chloro 1 4 methoxybenzyloxy methyl 2 oxo 1,2,3,4 tetrahydropyrimidine 4 sulphonate sodium l 4 acetylphenoxy methyl 5 chloro 2 oxo 1,2,3, 4 tetrahydropyrimidine 4 sulphonate sodium 5 chloro l 1 3 trifluoromethylphenyloxy ethyli 2 oxo 1,2,3,4 tetrahydropyrimidine 4 sulphonate sodium 5 chloro l naphth l ylmethyloxy methyl 2 oxo 1,2,3,4 tetrahydropyrimidine 4 sulfonate and sodium 5 chloro l a phenyloxy ethyl 2 oxo 1,2,3,4 tetrahydropyrimidine 4 sulfonate. It will be appreciated that the compounds according to the invention, depending on the substituent groups present, may exist in optically active forms and all such forms, as well as mixtures thereof, including racemates, are included within the scope of the invention. As indicated above, our tests have shown that the bisulphite adducts of the invention have a metaphase arresting ability. The test we have used to determine this ability is that using a growing culture of L1210 cells as described inEuropean Patent Application Publication No. 87326. The compounds according to the invention are thus of interest in combatting abnormal cell proliferation. Their use is based on the concept of using a drug to arrest the cell division cycle reversibly in metaphase, so that subsequent treatment with a cytotoxic drug is less indiscriminate in its effects, as discussed in European Patent ApplicationPublication No. 87326. As described therein, it will normally be necessary to have a knowledge of the cell cycle kinetics of both the normal and abnormal cells to be treated, and to employ this to achieve the optimum result in the use of the compounds of the invention. The compounds according to the invention may be formulated for use in the conventional manner, and in a further aspect of the invention we provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of an adduct or compound of formula II according to the invention wherein the or any countercation is a physiologically acceptable cation together with one or more pharmaceutical carriers or excipients. The adducts according to the invention may be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions of either solid or liquid forms. The compositions may, for example, be presented in forms suitable for administration by the rectal, parenteral or topical routes. Preferred forms include, for example suspensions, suppositories, creams, ointments, lotions and solutions e.g. for injection or infusion. The active ingredient may be incorporated in excipients customarily employed in pharmaceutical compositions such as, for example, talc, gum arabic, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, cocoa butter, aqueous or non aqueous vehicles, fatty substances of animal or vegetable origin, paraffin derivatives, glycols, various wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agents and or preservatives. Advantageously, the compositions may be formulated as dosage units, each unit being adapted to supply a fixed dose of active ingredient. Suitable dosage units for adults contain from 50 mg to 1.0 g of active ingredient. The dosage, which may be varied according to the compound used, the subject treated and the complaint concerned, may, for example, be from 0.25 to 7.0 g in a day in adults. In one aspect of the invention the compositions of the invention may take the form of compositions comprising an effective amount of a compound of formula I, or a physiologically acceptable addition salt thereof, formulated with an aqueous solution of a physiologically acceptable bisulphite or metabisulphite whereby the adduct is formed in situ in the composition. In such cases, it is convenient to use an excess of the physiologically acceptable bisulphite or metabisulphite and the formulation of the compound of formula I with the bisulphite or metabisulphite solution is preferably carried out immediately or shortly before administration of the composition. In another aspect, the invention provides the use of adducts or compounds of formula II according to the invention wherein the or any countercation is physiologically acceptable for the manufacture of a therapeutic agent for use in the treatment of the human or non human animal body to effect metaphase arrest of cell growth. In a further aspect, the invention provides the use of adducts or compounds of formula II according to the invention wherein the or any countercation is physiologically acceptable for the treatment of the human or non human animal body to effect metaphase arrest of cell growth. In a still further aspect, the invention provides a method of treatment of the human or non human animal body to effect metaphase arrest of cell growth which method comprises administering to said body an effective amount of an adduct or compound of formula II according to the invention wherein the or any countercation is physiologically acceptable . In another aspect the invention provides a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing an adduct or compound of formula II according to the invention wherein the or any countercation is physiologically acceptable with one or more pharmaceutical carriers or diluents. The adducts of the invention may be prepared by bisulphite addition to compounds of formula I. In one process, a bisulphite adduct of the invention may be prepared by addition of bisulphite to a pyrimidinone of formula I, where R and R1 are as previously defined. The reaction may be effected using a substance providing bisulphite ions, e.g. an appropriate metabisulphite, for example M2S2O5 where M is sodium, potassium, ammonium or trialkylammonium , Cay205 or Mugs202, in an aqueous medium such as water or water with a co solvent such as chloroform, dimethylformamide or dioxan optionally in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst such as benzyltrimethylammonium chloride.The reaction may be performed at for example 200 1000C, conveniently at 200 600C. The preparation of certain of the pyrimidinone starting materials for this process is described in European Patent Applications Publication Nos.56319 and 87326. Other compounds of formula I whose preparation is not specifically disclosed in those publications may be prepared using analogous methods. Certain of these novel compounds, which possess particularly useful metaphase arrest activity and which fall within the scope of the general disclosure of European Patent Applications PublicationNos. 56319 and 87326 although not being specifically disclosed therein are particularly valuable as intermediates in the preparation of the adducts of the invention and so form another aspect of the present invention. Thus according to this further aspect, the present invention provides compounds of formula IIIEMI10.1 3 wherein R represents the group CH20Rt3 in which represents a phenyl group substituted in the 3 4 position by a formyl group or CH2OCH2R in which R represents a phenyl group substituted in the 3 or 4 position by a methyl group or in the 3 and 4 positions by a chlorine atom and salts thereof, being compounds useful in the preparation of the adducts or compounds of formula II according to the invention. A particularly interesting compound of formulaIII is 5 chloro l 4 formylphenoxy methyl 2 1H pyrimidinone. The metaphase arresting ability of the compounds of formula III may be determined using the test described above and the compounds of formula III may be formulated for use as previously described for the bisulphite adducts of the invention and in another aspect, the invention accordingly provides pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one compound of formula III together with one or more pharmaceutical carriers or excipients.
