# Apparatus for uniformly heating a substrate.

## Abstract
Apparatus 40 for developing a substantially uniform temperature distribution across the entire transverse width of a relatively thin, relatively large area substrate 11 onto which a plurality of amorphous semiconductor layers will be deposited in a glow discharge deposition chamber. The apparatus includes a plurality of spaced heating elements 58 , the filaments of which are suspended above and angled relative to the plane of the substrate 11 so as to direct radiation onto that portion 13 of the substrae 11 which loses heat at the greatest rate with at least the same intensity as, and preferably greater intensity than, radiation is directed onto those portions of the substrate 11 which lose heat at lesser rates. By establishing the greatest intensity of radia tion adjacent that portion 13 of the substrate which most readily loses heat, a uniform distribution of temperature across the transverse width of the substrate 11 may be achieved.
