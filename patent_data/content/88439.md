# Gas chromatographic apparatus.

## Abstract
A gas chromatographic apparatus having at least two gas separation columns 5c, 5d arranged in parallel to each other, the outlet of the first gas separation column 5c being con nected to a gas sensor 6a through a column switch 11a valve, and the outlet of the second gas separation column 5d being connected to the column switch valve 11a through a gas detection time controlling pipe 13 , where when the first gas separation column 5c is communicated with the gas sen sor 6a , the outlet of the second gas separation column 5d is made open to the atmosphere by the column switch valve 11a , and when the second gas separation column 5d is communicated with the gas sensor 6a , the outlet of the first gas separation column 5c is made open to the atmosphere by the column switch valve 11a . A chromatogram with dis tinctly separated peaks in a continued state can be obtained in a short time by only one detecting and recording means 8a .
