# A method for the continuous extrusion and blowing of thin films of plastics material, in particular rigid PVC.

## Abstract
The heating of the powder of rigid polyvinyl chloride in an extrusion machine of known type presents difficulties and causes burning. According to the invention this is avoided by introducing continuously the raw material in the form of pow der after intense mixing with stabilizer and slides in the feed opening of a monoscrew extruder. The said monoscrew extruder has eight different zones an introduction zone pref erably without heating a slightly heated compression zone a heated homogenization zone H , a plasticizing zone a heated decompression zone D a heated degasifying zone G a heated compression zone Kâ‚‚ and a heated expulsion zone. For the plasticizing there is inserted in the extrusion screw before the decompression zone D a ring 3 provided with calibrated bores 4 and 5 which obstruct, that is, delay the flow so as to plasticize it without having to increase the temp erature.
