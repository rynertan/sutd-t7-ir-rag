# COUPLING ARRANGEMENT FOR DRIVING AND DRIVEN MEMBERS

## Abstract
A coupling arrangement is disclosed whereby a metallic driven member 4 is coupled to a metallic driving member 2 through a non metallic adapter 6 . Adapter 6 has an internal harmonically varying polygonal profile 12 which mates with a like external polygonal profile 14 on the driven member. A coupling arrangement of the type described has sufficient strength to transmit required torques from the driving 2 to the driven 4 members and has sufficient compliance to accept relatively high misalignments between the driving 2 and driven 4 members without excessive wear on said members as might otherwise occur.
