## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to a thermosettable adhesive or sealant plastisol dispersion composition which, on heating at or above the fluxing temperature, rapidly provides handling strength and can be crosslinked to give a thermoset seal or bond by heat. The invention also relates to a process for forming a crosslinked, bond or seal.2. Description of the Prior Art Conventional plastisol compositions are made up of finely divided thermoplastic resin particles in a liquid, non volatile plasticizer in which the resin is insoluble at room temperature. On elevating the temperature of the composition, the resin particles are substantially completely plasticized by the plasticizer producing a homogeneous solid solution which is a rubbery, thermoplastic gel. The most widely used resin in plastisol compositions has been polyvinyl chloride because of certain inherent characteristics. Vinyl chloride resins produced either by bulk, suspension or aqueous emulsion polymerization or mixtures thereof have been found to be particularly advantageous in such compositions. Vinyl chloride resins produced by aqueous emulsion polymerization, because of their excellent stir in properties which permit easy dispersion in a liquid plasticizer up to a high concentration of the resin at room temperature to form paste like mixtures, have been found useful in many applications. However, vinyl chloride resins whether produced by bulk, suspension or by emulsion polymerization, have certain drawbacks. Vinly chloride resin decomposes upon heating in processing and releases corrosive hydrogen chloride which ultimately results in the discoloration and deterioration of fabricated polymer properties. A problem recently noted in regard to polyvinyl chloride is the possible carcinomatous effect these polymers may have on the human body due to possibly residual vinyl chloride monomer being present in the polymer. In light of the above, there has been a recent search for materials which can be substituted for polyvinyl chloride in various end uses. The conventional plastisols after plasticization normally have low heat resistance resulting from the plasticization which reduces the heat deflection temperature of the polymers. To improve the heat resistance, reactive plasticizers such as diacrylates Dainippon Ink and Chemical JP 80 52,335 and epoxy resins Dunlop, JP 81 00841 were mixed with conventional plasticizers to provide crosslinks after curing the fluxed plastisol. In general, the thermosettable plastisol is based on two reactive ingredients separated physically as two packages. This separation leads to the problems of non uniform mixing and inaccurate metering in application. Furthermore, the materials, after mixing, have to be used in a very short period to prevent gellation caused by the crosslinking reaction. This creates difficulties such as short pot life, quality control and the economic concerns of a two package thermoset system. To prepare a one package thermoset, technology such as chemical blocking of the reactive group was developed.Unfortunately, the available one package systems suffer from short shelf life and reduced curing speed. A solution to this problem is to prepare reactive plastisols which rapidly turn to a flexible or rubbery solid upon heating at a temperature above the fluxing point to provide handling mechanical strength and cure to a wholly crosslinked thermoset at the same or more elevated temperature after fluxing. In these materials the plasticizer for the thermoplast contains functional groups which in the presence of latent thermal curing agents allow the plasticizer to cure on heating. One example of such a system is set out in U. S. 4,020,966.Therein a liquid epoxide plasticizer and a resin component comprising a copolymer of a normal alpha olefin and maleic anhydride are admixed at room temperature and heated to an elevated temperature, e. g., 2000C, resulting in a fluxed, thermoset product.3. Summary of the Invention This invention concerns the preparation of a onecomponent thermoset based on the reaction of isocyanate terminated compounds and blocked polyisocyanates with polymers containing at least two hydrogen active moieties such as polyvinyl acetals, polyvinyl alcohol and copolymers of polyvinyl alcohol. This invention also deals with using the combination of plastisol technology and thermoset chemistry to achieve the preparation of one component thermoset resins. A thermosettable resin converts to an infusible crosslinked plastic through irreversible curing reactions. Because of this permanent property change, excellent heat resistance and good mechanical properties are obtained. Furthermore, thermosetting resins are normally in the form of low molecular weight oligomers having a low viscosity for processing convenience. Based on these facts, the thermoset resin has been used in applications such as adhesives, sealants, coatings, composites, reaction injection moldings, laminates and others. In general, known thermosettable polyurethanes are based on two reactive ingredients, a polyisocyanate and a resin containing hydrogen active moieties such as a polyol or polyamine. Therefore, to obtain a good shelf life, the two components have to be physically separated to prevent the crosslinking reaction. This separation results in the problems of non uniform mixing and inaccurate metering in application. Consequently, this separation leads to inconsistency of material properties. Additionally, the materials, after mixing, have to be used in a very short period to prevent gellation caused by the crosslinking reaction. Undoubtedly, this could also lead to the difficulty of pot life control and the economic concerns of two package thermoset systems. Using thermodynamic control, the blocked isocyanate has been used in one package thermosetting urethane applications. The formation and thermal cleavage of blocked isocyanates can be represented as follows EMI4.1 Cleavage temperatures range from 600 to 2000C, depending on the structure of the blocking agents. Upon heating above the cleavage temperature, the blocked isocyanate dissociates and forms the original isocyanate which reacts with the formulated compounds containing hydrogen active groups to provide crosslinks. However, because of the slow reversible reaction, the curing speed usually is a concern in practical applications. The plastisol technology is being used in industry to process thermally degradable polyvinyl chloride PVC having a decomposition temperature lower than its melting point. A classical plastisol is composed of fine PVC powder dispersed in a plasticizer. Because the plasticization occurs only at a certain temperature, the liquid or pasty plastisol solidifies at initial fusion temperature, develops its physical integrity at minimum fluxing temperature and becomes a clear homogeneous solid at its clear point. The plasticization depends on diffusion and compatibility between the plasticizer and polymer. In the process, the polymer powder turns from individually separated particles to a homogeneous solid without melt. The finished product varies from rubbery plastic to rigid material, according to the structure of the plasticizer and the composition of the plastisol. To combine the plasticization principle and thermoset technology, the plastisol prepared from a polymer containing active hydrogen groups and a plasticizer having isocyanate terminated groups or blocked isocyanate structures should have storage stability, a rapid growth of handling strength attributed to plasticization and a structural strength after curing. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION One object of the instant invention is to produce a novel process and composition. Another object of the instant invention is to produce a one component, thermosettable plastisol composition which is useful as an adhesive or sealant. Yet another object of the instant invention is to produce a plastisol composition which on curing substantially minimizes or precludes exuding or extraction of the plasticizer. Still another object of the invention is to produce a plastisol composition which on heating to the fluxing temperature acquires handling strength and cures to a thermoset at or above said fluxing temperature. Other objects will become apparent from a reading hereinafter. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a one component thermosettable reactive plastisol composition comprising 1 at least one thermoplast in powder form containing at least two active hydrogen groups, e. g., polyvinyl acetals, polyvinyl alcohol, acrylic or methacrylic acid copolymers, acrylamides, hydroxyethyl acrylate or methacrylate copolymer 2 a liquid plasticizer having isocyanate or blocked isocyanate terminal groups, either per se or in combination with a plasticizer group member selected from the group consisting of a an acrylate terminated monomer, oligomer or prepolymer, b an epoxide resin containing more than one epoxide group per molecule, and c a mixture of a and b . The composition can optionally also contain a conventional accelerator for the reaction of isocyanate with active hydrogen groups as well as latent curing agents for the epoxide resin and free radical thermal initiators for the acrylate terminated monomer, oligomer or prepolymer. The composition is useful as an adhesive, sealant or coating and when heated at or above its fluxing temperature acquires good handling strength due to plasticization and good structural strength after heat curing. Further curing on aging is obtained through the reaction of moisture with any isocyanate residue. The plastisol of the invention operates in the same method as conventional plastisols. That is, herein the term plastisol refers to dispersions of finely divided thermoplastic resin particles in a liquid non volatile plasticizer in which the resin is insoluble and cannot be swollen by the plasticizer at room temperature. However, at elevated temperatures, the resin fluxes, i. e., is substantially completely plasticized by the plasticizer so that a homogeneous, solid solution is obtained which forms a rubbery thermoplastic mass. At this point the plastisol has handling or mechanical strength. Further heating at or above the fluxing temperature results in a thermoset material with ultimate structural strength. If only the plasticizer is reactive, it will crosslink to a thermoset and form a semi interpenatrating network.If the reactive plasticizer reacts with the thermoplast, a crosslinked interpenetrating network results. In addition to the resin thermoplast and the plasticizer, the formulation may also contain latent curing agents, electrically conductive particles, fillers, pigments, stabilizers and various conventional compound ingredients. The plastisol compositions herein are formed by admixture of 100 parts by weight of the resin particles with about 50 to 2,000 parts by weight of a plasticizer per 100 parts of resin and, when necessary, 0.5 to 20 parts by weight of a latent thermal initiator for the plasticizer group member or 0.1 to 5 parts by weight of an accelerator for the isocyanate reaction. Thereafter, the pasty plastisol admixture is heated at a temperature at or above the fluxing temperature which is lower than the melting point of the thermoplast resin for a time sufficient to plasticize the resin by the plasticizer and obtain a homogeneous, solid solution which is a rubbery mass. Additionally, it is also possible to heat the plastisol composition above the melting point of the resin and obtain a fluxed product.The pasty plastisol can be placed between two adherends and heated at or above the decomposition temperature of the initiator and fluxing temperature of the plastisol to flux and initiate the polymerization at the same time. The polyvinyl acetals used as a thermoplast in the instant invention are prepared from aldehydes and polyvinyl alcohols. Polyvinyl alcohols are high molecular weights synthetic resins, preferably above 1,000 g mole, containing various percentages of hydroxyl and acetate groups produced by hydrolysis of polyvinyl acetate.Polyvinyl alcohols are usually classified as partially hydrolyzed 15 30 polyvinyl acetate groups and completely hydrolyzed 0 5 acetate groups . Both types, in various molecular weight grades, are used in producing commercially available polyvinyl acetals. The conditions of the acetal reaction and the concentration of the particular aldehyde and polyvinyl alcohol used are closely controlled to form polymers containing predetermined proportions of hydroxyl groups, acetate groups and acetal groups. The final product may be represented by the following stylized structure EMI8.1 wherein R is H, CnH2n l wherein n is 1 10, unsaturated olefin or aryl groups. The poly vinyl acetals may be made either from poly vinyl alcohol or directly from poly vinyl acetate without separating the alcohol. The two most widely used polyvinyl acetals are polyvinyl formal and polyvinyl butyral. In the preparation of polyvinyl formal the direct process is normally used. That is, in a typical process, 100 parts of polyvinyl acetate are added to a mixture of 200 parts acetic acid and 70 parts water, which has been warmed to about 700C and stirred to complete solution.60 parts 40 formalin and 4 parts of sulfuric acid catalyst are added and the reaction is carried out for 24 hours at 70 CC. Water is added to the mixture with rapid agitation to precipitate the granules which are then washed free from acid and dried. Commercially available polyvinyl formal can have weight average molecular weights ranging from about 10,000 to about 40,000, a hydroxyl content expressed as percent polyvinyl alcohol ranging from 5.0 to 7.0, an acetate content expressed as percent polyvinyl acetate ranging from 9.5 to 30 and a formal content expressed as percent polyvinyl formal ranging from 68 to 82 . In a typical process for forming polyvinyl butyral, 140 parts of fully hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohol are suspended in 800 parts of ethanol. 80 parts of butyraldehyde and 8 parts of sulfuric acid are added and the reaction is carried out at about 800C for 5 to 6 hours.The solution of polyvinyl butyral is diluted with methanol and the polymer precipitated by the addition of water during vigorous agitation. The polymer is then stabilized, washed and dried. Commercially available polyvinyl butyrals have weight average molecular weights ranging from 30,000 to 270,000, a hydroxyl content ranging from 9 to 21 , an acetate content ranging from 0 to 2.5 and a butyral content ranging from 80 to 88 . Although these two polyvinyl acetates are the most widely used because of their commercial availability, other polyvinyl acetals such as polyvinyl propional, polyvinyl acetal and polyvinyl benzal are also operable herein. The polyvinyl acetal particles used herein have a particle size in the range from about 0.1 to about 1,500 microns. Acrylic or methacrylic acid copolymers are synthesized from the copolymerization of acrylic or methacrylic acid and vinyl monomers such as methacrylate, styrene and vinyl acetate. The properties of a copolymer depend on the composition of the polymer. The carboxylic group reacts with isocyanate after the plastisol is fluxed at a temperature above the fluxing point and forms an amide. Polyvinyl alcohols used to form the thermoplast in powder form herein are the same as those set out supra to form the polyvinyl acetals.

Accelerators for the epoxy resin thermal initiators such as monuron, chlorotoluron and similar substances are also operable and can be added in amounts ranging from 0.1 to 10 parts by weight of the epoxy resin plasticizer. In practicing the invention, it is sometimes possible to use a thermal initiator for curing the plasticizer which decomposes at a temperature lower than the fluxing temperature of the plastisol, especially when the composition is quickly heated to the fluxing temperature.This is due to the fact that the fluxing rate is much faster than the curing rate at the fluxing temperature.Thus, one can heat quickly to the fluxing temperature, flux the plastisol and cool down below the decomposition temperature of the thermal initiator before curing occurs, thereby obtaining a thermoplastic plastisol ready to be cured to a thermoset adhesive on reheating. The heating step to cure the fluxed solid plastisol is usually carried out for a period of 10 seconds to 30 minutes at a temperature of 50 3000C, preferably 80 2000C which is sufficient to fully cure the composition to a solid thermoset adhesive, coating or sealant product. The heating step using a thermal initiator to cure the fluxed plastisol resin composition can be accomplished in several ways. In simple systems, the adhesive composition can be applied by manual means to an adherend, contacted with another adherend and the assembled system heated in a forced air oven until a thermoset bond results. Additionally and preferably, electromagnetic heating can be utilized as a faster and more efficient means of curing, especially where the substrates to be bonded are plastic materials. In addition to the formation of high strength bonds, electromagnetic bonding techniques aid in a fast bond setting times, and b automated part handling and assembly. In practicing the instant invention, electromagnetic heating can be employed with the adhesive composition herein to adhere 1 plastic to plastic, 2 plastic to metal and 3 metal to metal. For example, dielectric heating can be used to bond 1 and 2 supra if the adhesive composition contains sufficient polar groups to heat the composition rapidly and allow it to bond the adherends. Inductive heating can also be used to bond 1 , 2 and 3 . That is, when at least one of the adherends is an electrically conductive or ferromagnetic metal, the heat generated therein is conveyed by conductance to the adhesive composition thereby initiating the cure to form a thermoset adhesive.In the instance where both adherends are plastic, it is necessary to add an energy absorbing material, i. e., an electrically conductive or ferromagnetic material, preferably in fiber or particle form 10 400 mesh to the adhesive composition. The energy absorbing material is usually added in amounts ranging from 0.1 to 2 parts by weight, per 1 part by weight of the adhesive plastisol resin composition prior to fluxing. It is also possible to impregnate the plastic adherend at the bonding joint with particles of the energy absorbing material in order to use inductive heating, but care must be exercised that the plastic is not distorted. The particulate electromagnetic energy absorbing material used in the adhesive composition when induction heating is employed can be one of the magnetizable metals including iron, cobalt and nickel or magnetizable alloys or oxides of nickel and iron and nickel and chromium and iron oxide. These metals and alloys have high Curie points 7300 2,0400F . Electrically conductive materials operable herein when inductive heating is employed include, but are not limited to, the noble metals, copper, aluminum, nickel, zinc as well as carbon black, graphite and inorganic oxides. There are two forms of high frequency heating operable herein, the choice of which is determined by the material to be adhered. The major distinction is whether or not the material is a conductor or non conductor of electrical current. If the material is a conductor, such as iron or steel, then the inductive method is used. If the material is an insulator, such as wood, paper, textiles, synthetic resins, rubber, etc., then dielectric heating can also be employed. Most naturally occurring and synthetic polymers are non conductors and, therefore, are suitable for dielectric heating. These polymers may contain a variety of dipoles and ions which orient in an electric field and rotate to maintain their alignment with the field when the field oscillates. The polar groups may be incorporated into the polymer backbone or can be pendant side groups, additives, extenders, pigments, etc. For example, as additives, lossy fillers such as carbon black at a one percent level can be used to increase the dielectric response of the plastisol adhesive. When the polarity of the electric field is reversed millions of times per second, the resulting high frequency of the polar units generates heat within the material. The uniqueness of dielectric heating is in its uniformity, rapidity, specificity and efficiency. Most plastic heating processes such as conductive, convective or infrared heating are surface heating processes which need to establish a temperature within the plastic by subsequently transfering the heat to the bulk of the plastic by conduction. Hence, heating of plastics by these methods is a relatively slow process with a non uniform temperature resulting in overheating of the surfaces. By contrast, dielectric heating generates the heat within the material and is therefore uniform and rapid, eliminating the need for conductive heat transfer.In the dielectric heating system herein the electrical frequency of the electromagnetic field is in the range 1 3,000 megahertz, said field being generated from a power source of 0.5 1,000 kilowatts. Induction heating is similar, but not identical, to dielectric heating. The following differences exist a magnetic properties are substituted for dielectric properties b a coil is employed to couple the load rather than electrodes or plates and c induction heaters couple maximum current to the load. The generation of heat by induction operates through the rising and falling of a magnetic field around a conductor with each reversal of an alternating current source. The practical deployment of such field is generally accomplished by proper placement of a conductive coil.When another electrically conductive material is exposed to the field, induced current can be created. These induced currents can be in the form of random or eddy currents which result in the generation of heat.Materials which are both magnetizable and conductive generate heat more readily than materials which are only conductive. The heat generated as a result of the magnetic component is the result of hysteresis or work done in rotating magnetizable molecules and as a result of eddy current flow. Polyolefins and other plastics are neither magnetic nor conductive in their natural states.Therefore, they do not, in themselves, create heat as a result of induction. The use of the eletromagnetic induction heating method for adhesive bonding of plastic structures has proved feasible by interposing selected eletromagnetic energy absorbing materials in an independent adhesive composition layer or gasket conforming to the surfaces to be bonded, electromagnetic energy passing through the adjacent plastic structures free of such energy absorbing materials is readily concentrated and absorbed in the adhesive composition by such energy absorbing materials thereby rapidly initiating cure of the adhesive plastisol composition to a thermoset adhesive. Electromagnetic energy absorbing materials of various types have been used in the electromagnetic induction heating technique for some time. For instance, inorganic oxides and powdered metals have been incorporated in bond layers and subjected to electromagnetic radiation. In each instance, the type of energy source influences the selection of energy absorbing material. Where the energy absorbing material is comprised of finely divided particles having ferromagnetic properties and such particles are effectively insulated from each other by particle containing nonconducting matrix material, the heating effect is substantially confined to that resulting from the effects of hysteresis. Consequently, heating is limited to the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material or the temperature at which the magnetic properties of such material cease to exist. The electromagnetic adhesive composition of this invention may take the form of an extruded ribbon or tape, a molded gasket or cast sheet. In liquid form it may be applied by brush to surfaces to be bonded or may be sprayed on or used as a dip coating for such surfaces. The foregoing adhesive plastisol composition, when properly utilized as described hereinafter, results in a one component, solvent free bonding system which permits the joining of metal or plastic items without costly surface pretreatment. The electromagnetically induced bonding reaction occurs rapidly and is adaptable to automated fabrication techniques and equipment. To accomplish the establishment of a concentrated and specifically located heat zone by induction heating for bonding in accordance with the invention, it has been found that the electromagnetic adhesive plastisol compositions described above can be activated and a bond created by an induction heating system operating with an electrical frequency of the electromagnetic field of from about 5 to about 30 megacycles and preferably from about 15 to 30 megacycles, said field being generated from a power source of from about 1 to about 30 kilowatts, and preferably from about 2 to about 5 kilowatts. The electromagnetic field is applied to the articles to be bonded for a period of time of less than about 2 minutes. As heretofore mentioned, the electromagnetic induction bonding system and improved electromagnetic adhesive compositions of the present invention are applicable to the bonding of metals, thermoplastic and thermoset material, including fiber reinforced thermoset material. The following examples will help to explain, but expressly not limit, the instant invention. Unless otherwise noted, all parts and percentages are by weight. The lap shear strengths of the adhesives were measured on an Instron Tensile Tester using the method set out inASTM D 1002.

After standing overnight, the isocyanate terminated plasticizers were ready for plastisol preparation.

Each plastisol fluxed into a clear solid material upon heating at 1500 C for 5 minutes.After exposing to the air overnight, both materials increased in rigidity through the reaction of moisture with isocyanate residue. Example 4 30 g of polyvinyl formal Formvar 15 95 E fromMonsanto was dispersed in 70 g of the isocyanate terminated plasticizer from Example 1. The plastisol was stable at least a month upon standing at room temperature. The plastisol was a clear flexible solid material after fluxing at 1500C for 5 minutes. This solid material increased its stiffness by reacting its isocyanate residue with moisture in air.
