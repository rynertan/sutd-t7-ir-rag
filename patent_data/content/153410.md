# APPARATUS FOR RECORDING AND REPRODUCING SIGNAL.

## Abstract
A signal recording apparatus wherein, when an input signal is recorded reciprocatingly on a recording medium 6 in such a manner that, after a recording head 5 and the recording medium 6 have moved relative to each other in one direction the first direction , they move in the opposite direction the second direction , the input signal is delivered to the recording head 5 through a delay element 3 , and a signal delay quantity in the relative movement of the recording head 5 and the recording medium 6 in the second direction is set so as to be larger than the signal delay quantity in the movement thereof in the first direction, and the difference between these delay quantities is set so as to be longer than the time required for a movement reversal. Also disclosed is a signal recording and reproducing appar atus which is provided with means for delaying a reproduc tion signal from a reproducing head when a signal recorded on the recording medium 6 by this signal recording apparatus is reciprocatingly reproduced, and in which a reproduction signal delay quantity before the movement reversal is set so as to be larger than the reproduction signal delay quantity after the movement reversal in order to prevent the omission of any signal during the movement reversal, thereby obtaining temporarily continuous signals. The signal recording apparatus is also provided with a signal recording apparatus which records a reversal mark in the vicinity of the movement reversal position on the recording medium 6 . The signal recording and reproducing apparatus is also able to reciprocatingly record on the recording medium 6 an input signal and an address corresponding to the input signal, and read out, in reproduction in the first direction, both addresses recorded in the first and second directions, and compare the two addresses to determine the position at which the movement is reversed from reproduc tion in the first direction to reproduction in the second direction.
