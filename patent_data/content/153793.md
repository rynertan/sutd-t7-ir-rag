## Description
LOADING UNLOADING MEANS FOR SLIDER DEVICES This invention relates to means for making high speed magnetic recording transducers and more particularly to such means as adapted for supporting air bearing sliders. Background, Features Workers in the art of designing, making and using high speed, precision magnetic recording equipment are well aware of the need for continual improvement in the mounting of the tiny, delicate, preciselydimensioned sliders read write transducers of the air bearing type commonly used today with high speed data processing equipment. For instance, FIG. 1 shows plan view a relatively conventional mounting arrangement for an air bearing slider 1 S Winchester type, as commonly known in the art supported on a mounting gimbal flexure l f which in turn is cantilevered out at a precise orientation from a relatively rigid mounting load beam 1 b, in many instances, a second such array is also included cf. slider 1 S on flexure l f in phantom also see related mounting arrangements in U.S. 4,286,297 to Root et al. and in U.S. 4,268,879 to Watrous . For instance, workers are familiar with random access disk drive memory arrangements with Winchester sliders that conventionally overfly a disk surface at flying heights of 40 to 100 microinches or the lightweight, low mass mini Winchester sliders which fly as close as 14 to 25 microinches. FIG. 2 shows a related design for mounting a slider 2 S understood as the self loading type here e.g., see U.S. 3,855,625 on a different flexure spring 2 f projected from a relatively rigid mounting beam 2 b as workers in the art will understand with a second like slider 2 S1 on flexure 2 f also commonly included as depicted in phantom . The present invention is directed toward teaching improved slider mounting arrangements useful as alternatives to such conventional arrays, and particularly for eliminating the need for flexure springs these being rather bulky, fussy, and rather imprecise and inefficient. Slider mounting arrays such as those shown in FIG. 1 and mentioned in the cited patents are commonly arranged to overfly the recording surface on a magnetic disk, when the disk is spun up to a prescribed surface velocity. The air bearing face of such sliders is normally contemplated as resting on a landing zone portion of such a disk surface when the disk is at rest taking off to overfly the disk as it is spun up. The present invention is devoted toward minimizing or eliminating the role of such mounting flexures and of the associated landing takeoff zones on magnetic disk records. Workers recognize that the information on such disks must usually be retrieved just as quickly as possible without any damage to the storage media.Workers understand that, to obtain the necessary high bit densities with useful recording readback characteristics, a slider must fly very, very close to the disk surface sometimes as close as a few microinches. Consequently, the air bearing face of the slider must be uncommonly smooth, as must the surface of the disk e.g., to a point where the two surfaces can wring together stick when merely resting against one another . Workers recognize that such an uncommonly high degree of smoothness to within two microinches or less means that essentially all surface anomalies asperities or nodules , however miniscule, must be eliminated to facilitate a level over flight e.g., a very tiny nodule like a speck of dust can induce a good deal of rebound of the slider overflying the passing disk surface, leading to read write problems .My invention can reduce such rebound , reduce the incidence of debris and eliminate such wringing of slider and medium. Also, workers would love to eliminate landing takeoff of a slider not only to save recording space eliminate landing takeoff zones , but also to eliminate the slider disk abrasion and resulting debris and avoid the drag that slider disk contact imposes on the disk rotation system. The need for aerodynamic takeoff landing surfaces is also eliminated since one dispenses with landing and takeoff maneuvers. The subject invention is directed towards fulfilling these goals and others, as discussed below. Workers recognize that if takeoff landing loading unloading zones did not have to be provided on a disk surface, the disk s storage capacity would be greatly enhanced. Further, there is the mentioned problem of debris generated by slider disk contact during landing and takeoff . This debris will obviously contaminate the environment in a disk file and may eventually lead to disastrous problems, such as head crash , as workers well realize. Also, the slider disk friction has led to unnecessarily large oversized spindle motors with their attendant excess costs, space consumption, and heat generation, etc. contrary tb he present trend toward miniaturizing and simplifying disk drives. The present invention proposes improved slider mounting arrangements whereby the head can be loaded and unloaded more precisely, more gently, and without necessarily involving slider disk contact while the disk is rotating. Thus, one can avoid the need for takeoff landing zones on the disk and avoid practically all head disk contact, reducing the likelihood of debris contamination , head crash, and the like. bellows mounted slider In one form, the invention involves a low mass diaphragm bellows on which a slider may be attached, thus eliminating or de emphasizing and miniaturiz 5aY flexure spring mounts. FIG. 3 shows an example in schematic plan view wherein a slider 3 S is mounted on the exposed surface of a bellows 3 L which, in turn, is mounted directly on a relatively conventional rigid beam 3 b details below . Such a diaphragmmounting can be controlled to load a slider operatively adjacent an associated passing disk surface to fly there relatively easily, simply and conveniently for instance, by activating a bellows expanding pneumatic means as known in the art and discussed below . The common flexure mount may thus be eliminated or, when preferred, such may be used also, though reduced in size e.g., see FIG. 12 . An associated problem with such conventional sliders is that of transitional stability , in that being mounted on the mentioned gimbal flexure , the unit characteristically undergoes a period of instability tendency to climb steeply away from the disk, then dive back down unpredictably during every takeoff and landing usually at some characteristic disk rpm. Present disk drives try to minimize this, and make the period as brief as possible, by hyper accelerating decelerating the disk during startup or slowdown unfortunately, this involves providing an oversized, high torque spindle motor which otherwise would be unnecessary. The present invention avoids this problem entirely by eliminating such flexure mountings, as well as eliminating the takeoff and landing maneuvers. Another common goal now is to minimize mount size, reducing the space required for head mounting as much as possible. This allows one to locate sliders closer together on a common arm, with an associated improvement in access times . Of course, one way to do this is to replace the relatively massive load beam with a mount according to the present invention. Thus, the invention can allow one to mount sliders closer together e.g., with a number of bellows mounted heads carried on a single support beam as in FIG. 4 see slider 4 S on bellows 4 L, and sliders 4 S , 4 s , likewise bellows mounted on beam 4 b . An associated advantage with the subject invention and attenuation of load beam length is the reduction in mass of the slider supports e.g., using a tiny, light diaphragm mount . This leads to an associated decrease in the tendency of the assembly to resonate lower mass means higher natural resonant frequency e.g., one common headarm assembly design resonates at about 1770 Hz by contrast, a related design modified according to the invention resonates at about 4000 Hz . piston mounted slider Another related slider mounting is via a piston assembly whereby one or two piston mounted to slide freely in a bore and carrying a slider on its exposed face is adapted to be fluid thr ust, selectively, to present its slider operatively adjacent a respective moving disk surface e.g., note FIGS. 5 9 and following description . In some cases, such a piston mounting may be affixed directly on a beam and operate like the afore discussed bellows mount e.g., eliminate gimbal flexures, etc. . In other situations e.g., FIGS. 5 9 , the piston mounting may, itself, be mounted on a flexure spring, and so operate somewhat as conventional flexures do. However, preferably such an array will be adapted to use only the piston assembly for loading and unloading functions e.g., eliminating the usual concern over transitional instability . Thus, as one feature hereof, a flying slider is mounted on its rigid supporting load beam via a fluid controlled mount through which it may be hydraulically urged, under close control, toward and away from its reference passing disk surface for transducer operations therewith e.g., being urged close enough so the slider is made to fly above the disk without need for takeoff procedures. Brief Description of the Drawings These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be appreciated by workers as they become better understood by reference to the following detailed description of the present preferred embodiments which should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference symbols denote like elements FIGS. 1 and 2 depict, in plan view, aWinchester slider mounting and a self loading slider mounting, respectively, these being apt for modification with the invention FIG. 3 depicts, in like plan view, an onbellows slider mounting embodiment, with a plurality thereof in like FIG. 4 FIGS. 5 and 6 depict, in respective plan and side view, another piston mounting embodiment, with the piston assembly therefor being shown enlarged in FIG. 7 side view , FIG. 8 end section andFIG. 9 end and sectional view of piston portion FIG. 10 shows, in schematic, simplified side view, another bellows mounting embodiment, withFIG. 11 showing an associated preferred slider shaping configuration in plan view and FIG. 12 shows, in plan view, another n flexure on bellows embodiment, with FIG. 13 showing the flexure therefor in plan view. Description of Preferred Embodiments General description, background FIGS. 5 9 schematically illustrate a piston mounted slider assembly constructed according to principles of this invention. This, and other related techniques and means discussed for all embodiments, will generally be understood as constructed and operating as presently known in the art, except where otherwise specified. And, except as otherwise specified, all materials, methods and devices and apparatus herein will be understood as implemented by known expedients according to present good practice. Detailed Specification piston mounting More particularly, FIGS. 5 and 6 will be understood as schematically depicting a novel head mounting assembly 5 A improved according to the invention and comprising a relatively conventional rigid mounting beam 5 b adapted according to the invention to selectively present two pairs of relatively conventional Winchester type sliders SL SL andSSL SSL , as detailed below conjunctively into transducing relation with the respective confronting surfaces of a pair of adjacent conventional magnetic disk records D, D as understood in the art. Beam 5 b also will be understood to preferably mount control electronic means, such as chip 5 C and associated electronics, along with the piston mounting according to this embodiment.Here, the piston mounting comprises a dual piston assembly 5 CP and associated conduit e.g., 5 CP and 5 T1 for sliders mounted at the distal end of a respective flexure spring these to act as return springs during unloading .A fluid conduit 5 T is provided for selectively admitting pressurized air from a source S P provided and operated as known in the art to activate the slider pairs selectively and conjunctively from a rest unloaded position not shown well away from the respective disk face, to the transducing loaded condition shown in FIG. 6. Side view of assembly 5 A with both sliders SL, SL of a comounted pair operatively disposed near respective disk faces as mentioned. More particularly, a dual piston engagement arrangement, with one two piston array mounting each of two pair of sliders e.g., dual piston array 5 CP for sliders SL, SL in conjunction with an associated section of the conduit 5 T e.g., 5 T1 for array 5 CP .As mentioned, each piston array is mounted on a suitable flexure spring somewhat conventional e.g., flexure f for slider 8L f for SL cf. material and design equivalent to spring flexure 2 f in FIG. 2 . Thus, dual piston load beam 5 H1 will be understood as attached medially to flexures f, fl on which are mounted sliders SL, SL with a like load beam 5 H2 provided for companion flexures carrying the other slider pair SLL, SLY , not described in detail here however, see associated air conduit segment 5 T2 .Thus, each piston thrusts its flexure pair to load the sliders thereon. Retraction of the piston unloads . Conventional load beams are formed and arranged to load the slider e.g., 15 gm. or so whereas load beams 5 H1, 5 H2 do not load their sliders at all instead, the associated piston or diaphragm does this and does it so as to readily vary the time and or amount of the loading . FIGS. 7, 8 and 9 show in greater, enlarged detail the makeup of dual piston engagement array 5 CP.Array 5 CP comprises a hollow positioning cylinder C attached, at its midpoint, to an intersecting air inlet tube t communicating with the interior bore of cylinder C. Tube t is adapted, as workers will understand, to provide rigid inlet for selective admission of pressurized air, being connected to the associated portion 5 T1 of conduit 5 T from the pressurized air source S P. Completing the array 5 CP are a pair of identical pistons Pl, P2 attahed to a medial portion of a respective load beam spring . Pistons Pl, P2 are positioned and adapted tf be seated in free floating, air tight condition in opposite ends of the bore in cylinder C in 3symmetric opposition P1 attached to flexure f and P2 attached to flexure f as indicated in FIG. 7, the Fistons being shown in phantom . The indicated position of the pistons inFIG. 7 will be understood as the rest or disengaged unloaded, with pistons retracted in C, and almost touching condition wherein the pressure in inlet conduits 5 T, etc., is at or close to ambient.Workers will understand that a high pressure pulse of air from source S P, along 5 T and 5 T1, 5 T2, and through t, into the center bore of cylinder C will throw the pistons P1, P2 outward relatively the same amount if the loads thereon are substantially the same, etc. this pulse being a prescribed pressure, sufficient to induce a prescribed outward excursion and load the respective sliders, as workers will understand . That is, this will thrust the attached flexures f, f outwardly into loaded condition whereat the respective sliders S1, SL will be disposed in the operative transducing flying relation with their respective disk surface, as understood in the art e.g., see engaged position of flexure f shown in phantom in FIG. 7 . When the sliders are to be unloaded , one need only reduce the fluid pressure e.g., to ambient or below for faster retraction the load beam will assist in positive return. As workers will appreciate, the parts for assembly 5 CP may comprise any convenient materials and dimensions suited for the actuator array and associated supply of pressurized air. The pistons will be dimensioned to fit relatively freely within the bore of cylinder C while being engaged in good air tight relation therewith, as understood in the art. For instance, it has been found that a cylinder C with a bore of about 63 mils diameter and about 140 mils long is convenient for operative association with pistons P FIG. 9 about 62 mils in diameter and about 70 mils long plus a 25 mil extension for attachment with its load beam . For instance, we prefer to use hypodermic needle stock stainless steel for elements C and or T a feature of convenience and low expense. Inlet tube t may be any convenient compatible stock, being attached, such as by hard solder, in air tight relation 15 PSI to cylinder C at its exact center e.g, here for the foregoing example, an SS tube t of 49 mil OD, 38 mil ID is satisfactory , being long enough to allow convenient air tight attachment of the associated air conduit segment 5 T1, as workers will appreciate. The conduit segments may comprise known neoprene or Tygow , etc. tubing. Results Workers will appreciate that this embodiment provides a novel dual piston slider support arrangement apt for selectively translating a slider or a pair toward and away from an associated media surface, for loading and unloading thereof. Workers will understand that although this piston drive is operated and controlled to load and unload the sliders by pneumatic means, other equivalent means may be similarly employed. In operation of this embodiment, conceptually the pneumatic piston arrangement is intended to push the slider into operative f lying relation with the disk surface rotating there past, as understood by workers in the art with the here minor aerodynamic characteristics of the slider air bearing surface and its flexure taking over to maintain the proper operative flying height as known in the art here eliminating the need to touch the disk as mentioned above and the need to return to home position , circumferentially during positioning operations, as workers in the art will appreciate. It will be apparent that this piston drive can simply and easily produce a relatively constant, measured pneumatic force to gently and precisely load sliders engage in transducing operation with disk surface and maintain this engagement during a prescribed following read write operation the force being released whereupon the load beam vacuum assisted where desired will unload or disengage the sliders. Such an arrangement can obviously and simply be adapted to apply loading forces of different, continuous, selectable magnitudes and to readily maintain a relatively constant slider disk spacing e.g., across all tracks along the radius of the associated disk, yet the flexure can still allow some limited resilience for roll and pitch.Such gentle, precise loading unloading of a slider removes all need for contact with the disk surface, eliminates the need for landing takeoff zones, eliminates associated debris and or drag on the rotating disk, with elimination or radical reduction of the likelihood of head crash also eliminating the need for an oversized spindle motor. This arrangement will also allow one to fly lower closer to a disk surface, e.g., on the order of a few microinches with less risk of excessive rebound when overflying disk asperities. Also, the design of FIGS. 3, 4 diaphragm allows the size and mass of the flexure supports gimbals to be reduced making the entire head assemblies lighter, more responsive for quicker positioning, with much less danger of resonant oscillation higher natural frequency of the lighter mass . Of course, the elimination of landing takeoff zones on the disk will increase its memory capacity. Workers will appreciate that such a piston drive can also operate to load other air bearing sliders onto a stationary or a moving disk surface e.g., for Winchester, i.e. tapered rail sliders .The pistons may operate in the reverse manner that is, the mounting head arm assembly may be adapted to normally engage the slider with the disk, this being overridden for disengagement times, with the pistons placed under a vacuum to hold the heads disengaged the vacuum later released for re loading , whereupon the load beam will thrust the slider to be engaged with the disk e.g., in contact or flying relation . self loading sliders The foregoing embodiment may be adapted as workers will contemplate for substitution of a selfloading negative loading slider e.g., see the above recited 625 patent for example in place of the mentioned Winchester slider of FIGS. 5 9. As workers will recognize, one may adapt a relatively conventional flexure structure for this. As workers will recognize, in certain instances one may mount the slider directly on the diaphragm without an intervening flexure. In the case of the slider on piston t array e.g., FIG. 12 one may mount the slider on an intervening gimbal e.g., to accommodate pitch and roll whereas, the diaphragm, itself, can so serve e.g., cf. bellows mounted slider embodiment of FIGS. 10, 11 . FIGS. 3, 4 and 10 indicate, in sectional schematic fashion, a modified embodiment adapted to replace the afore described piston mount with a diaphragm type mount according to another feature of invention. Thus, here a pair of conventional, precisely rotatable magnetic recording disks Da, Db are shown with respective facing recording surfaces contemplated for operative disposition with a pair of opposed Winchester air bearing sliders SL a,SL b, these to be selectively loaded and unloaded with a respective disk surface by a common diaphragm mounting arrangement 10 A. The particulars of this embodiment will be understood as consistent with conventional good practice in the art, and the same as for the foregoing embodiments, except as otherwise specified. Here, a relatively rigid mounting arm tb no load beam cf.Figs. 3, 4 will be understood as arranged generally as in FIGS. 1 and 2 see plan view in FIG. 6 , being provided with an enlarged mounting portion tB E at its distal end. Portion tB E is centrally relieved bore B as indicated in FIG. 10 A and communicates with a central bore, or air conduit tB ac through bore tB. Bore tB ac will be understood as in pneumatic communication with a selectively operable source of pressurized gas, via associated conduit means as with the embodiment of FIGS. 5 9, and as understood in the art. On the opposing upper and lower faces of tip tB E are mounted a pair of identical tiny, light diaphragms BL a, BL b of the bellows type e.g., preferably like those used in a microphone . These serve to close end bore B, being sealed thereto in air tight relation by any suitable seal e.g., a swaged, or rolled over, or epoxy seal TS .Each bellows diaphragm will be understood as including a prescribed number of concentric flutes , terminating at the center with a raised center portion, or knob load point on which the respective slider is affixed see knob BL ac on which slider SL a is attached and BL bc on which slider SL b is attached . The construction of these bellows disks is obviously critical, being understood by workers as arranged to respond, under indicated pressure pulses, to symmetrically and opposingly thrust their respective slider into, and out of, loaded condition uniformly toward, and away from, a respective disk surface.The excursion will be just sufficient to place the air bearing surface of each slider into conventional operative relation flying relation with the rotating surface, as workers in the art will understand. It will be understood that the bellows walls will be of a prescribed uniform thickness as adapted for such operation resilience varies as the third power of thickness . For instance, with a desired engagementexcursion on the order of 5 mils under a pneumatic drive of about 2 psi above ambient , it has been found that a bellows diaphragm of the type illustrated and about 1 to 0.8 mils thick or less worked quite well this is, about one quarter the thickness of a piece of writing paper . This can be a microphone type diaphragm constructed by known plating processes to yield the desired thickness and shape, as workers in the art will understand. Workers will recognize that other diaphragm material may be substituted in certain cases e.g., plastic in some cases . In many cases it will be found convenient to cross groove the backside of the slider, as indicated in FIG. 11 plan view of slider SL b, along plane XI XI, FIG. 10 , to facilitate the positioning and attachment of the bellows knob load point .Thus, in FIG. 11 it will be understood that a pair of identical channels ch l, ch 2, about 0.04 inches wide and 0.002 inches deep, are cut in the backside of each slider SL, in the center thereof and transverse to one another, to leave a central cross groove circular cavity CV adapted for engagement with the bellows knob. One may seal couple the knob to the slider with epoxy or other known means e.g., laserweld if slider surface is nickel or the like . Operation Workers will recognize that, in many respects, this diaphragm mounted embodiment can operate like the afore described piston mounted embodiment e.g., keing closer, functionally, to mounting a slider atop the iston face via a flexure spring e.g., as in FIG. 12, described elsewhere . And, the features and advantages will, for the most part, be understood as similar. As opposed to the piston mount , the diaphragm slider suspension will be recognized as per se flexible e.g., its own return spring and of very low mass e.g., safe, high frequency resonance i Of course, such diaphragms may be easily actuated andclosely controlled over a fairly precise excursion. For example, with a Winchester slider affixed upon a bellows diaphragm like BL a, BL b on centerknob thereof , one will be understood to gradually increase the air pressure under BL a, BL b to gently produce a positive force to load the slider adjacent the disk, and maintain such a force during the read write process. The diaphragm can apply loads of different magnitudes so as to maintain a relatively constant head disk spacing over the entire range from the inner to the outer tracks. Controlled unloading can result from merely reducing the air pressure, as workers will appreciate e.g., the up thrust, distended bellowsdiaphragm will help act as its own return spring, once positive air pressure is reduced . Conversely, the diaphragm may be pre biased to normally load the slider urge it to transduce position except when overridden by the associated fluid drive cf. negative pressure normally held ON to keep slider unloaded but released when loading desired i.e., more positive pressure, or less vacuum, while slider is to be loaded . Then, for unloading , the fluid drive return force is reimposed. In the case of a self load slider, one need only apply positive air pressure for the onset of loading . That is, once the self loading slider is brought operatively adjacent the rotating disk surface, its own erodynamically developed air bearing pressures will hold it loaded indefinitely and the posi tve air pressure need not be maintained. Unloading is also simpler and slider assisted as well as bellows assisted one need only allow disk rpm to fall off and self unloading will take over, assisted to a greater or lesser extent by the inherent return spring bias of the bellows diaphragm on loading air pressure having been released already . In certain instances, one may even arrange the diaphragm to be pre biased negatively to assist in spring return of the slider once the countervailing on load pressure is released, and the reduced disk rpm decreases self load forces enough to allow this . Workers will applaud this improvement e.g., as opposed to more conventional designs where the load beam must be pre biased toward the disk with resultant slider disk contact, takeoff and landing abrasion, etc., which are all better avoided . Results As for the piston approach, workers will recognize how the subject invention can eliminate the usual space consuming load beam e.g., l f, l f in FIG. 1 or Z f, 2 f in FIG. 2 e.g., by mounting a bellows support for slider directly on a carrier arm as for bellows 3 L in FIG. 3 on arm 3 b, supporting slider 3 S or the several such bellows 4 L, 4 L , 4 L on arm 4 b in FIG. 4 carrying respective sliders 4 S, 4 S , 4 S . Evidently, the space heretofore required for load beams may now be used for multiple, more compact head mounts with related improvements in access time and data transfer both faster . Flexure on Piston Mounting FIG. 12 Workers may appreciate that a piston mount e.g., as in FIGS. 5 9 may be modified in certain cases to include a flexure mounting for the slider atop the presumably rigid mounting face of the piston e.g., to accommodate roll and pitch . For instance, assuming the structure in the embodiment of FIGS. 5 9, one may employ a ring gimbal flexure of the type indicated in plan view FIG. 12 comprising a spider SP of spring flexure material, with a central slider mounting pad 12 P connected by four symmetrically disposed arms 12 a, with an outer circumferential ring portion 12 r attached to a head arm and the piston, whereby to properly apply the loading force to the load point of the slider center of 12 P . Such a flexure may also be used with a diaphragm type mount e.g., to enhance flexibility and or to pre bias the slider toward, or away from, the disk . Such is schematically indicated in FIG. 13 plan view where a slider 13 S will be understood as mounted on a spider flexure SP as in FIG. 12 which is, in turn, mounted on a bellows diaphragm 13 L affixed on a rigid arm 13 b. Flexible Media Transducers Workers will recognize how one can modify the piston or the diaphragm arrangement to mount a R W head for flexible media, especially a self load slider, or one that is adapted to be held rigid and overflown by the passing floppy disk. It will be understood that the preferred embodiments described herein are only exemplary, and that the invention is capable of many modifications and variations in construction, arrangement and use without departing from the spirit of the invention. Workers will appreciate that such piston or diaphragm transducer mountings provide an arrangement adapted to translate a transducer e.g., such sliders toward and away from a medium without need for load beams or any like flexible arm, also dispensing with the need to move pivot such load beams e.g., resorting instead to 2fluid drive means pressurized gas that need only move the relatively tiny diaphragm or piston platform carrying the slider with or without intervening flexure gimbal. Workers will also appreciate that in appropriate instances one may alternatively so drive such a platform with other suitable means such as electromagnetic, piezo electric, etc. . Such a platform can be used to load aWinchester type slider and to selectively unload it vs the conventional load beam flexure which must be translated to position the slider to fly above the medium, then repositioned to unload or else the slider must be constantly thrust against the medium, and caused to take off and land as the medium is translated faster and slower . Similarly, such a platform can be used with a self loading type slider, without need for the usual load beam flexure. Further modifications of the invention are also possible. For example, the means and methods disclosed herein are also applicable to other disk memory systems and related head mountings, as well as to flexible media. Also, the present invention is applicable for providing the positioning required in other forms of recording and or reproducing systems, such as those in which data is recorded and reproduced optically. The above examples of possible variations of the present invention are merely illustrative.Accordingly, the present invention is to be considered as including all possible modifications and variations coming within the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
