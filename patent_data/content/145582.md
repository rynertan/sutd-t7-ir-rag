# SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE HAVING MATCHED TIMING DYNAMIC CIRCUIT AND STATIC CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A semiconductor device having a dynamic circuit 2 and a static circuit 3 , wherein a clock signal , in synchroniza tion with the operation of the static circuit 3 , initiates the operation of the dynamic circuit 2 . A delay circuit 5 of a static type is provided to delay the clock signal and generate a delayed clock signal
