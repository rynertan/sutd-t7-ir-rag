## Description
Apparatus for manufacturing a single crystal The present invention relates to an apparatus for manufacturing a single crystal by the Czochralski method. More particularly, it relates to an apparatus which can automatically shape a single crystal, while being pulled up from a crucible. Most of the single crystals of silicon are made by the Czochralsky method in which a seed crystal is dipped in molten silicon in a crucible, a Dash s neck is formed of the growing single crystal, and the crystal is pulled up at a controlled speed while the temperature of the molten silicon is being controlled and while the crystal is growing further. In this method, the crystal is made to grow until it has a desired diameter and then is pulled up while maintaining this diameter. Hithereto, whether or not the crystal may have a desired diameter largely depends on the skill of the workers. That is, until its diameter increases to a desired value, the crystal is first pulled at a speed lower than that when a trunk of the crystal is formed.When a skilled worker determines, by using or not using a scale, that the diameter of the crystal has become close to the desired value, he begins to pull it faster to prevent it from growing thicker. Thereafter, he lowers the pull up speed to a predetermined value, thus forming the trunk of the crystal. The diameter of the trunk may be adjusted by PID control. With the conventional method which much depends on the skills of a worker, it is difficult to produce single crystals of the same shape single crystals of different diameters or single crystals with lowered shoulders may be produced. Further, each crystal made by this method may have thick and thin portions. If the crystals are subjected to an excessive PID control lest they should have different diameters, they may have striations or an uneven impurity concentration distribution. Even if they have the same diameter, they must be ground when they are too thick or they must be discarded when they are too thin. Both grinding and discarding reduces the yield. A process of controlling the diameter of single crystals being made by the Czochralski method is disclosed in Japanese Patent Disclosure No. 55 130895.This process uses a ITV camera to monitor how the diameter of a single crystal being pulled up from the crucible changes with time. The rate of diameter change is used to control the speed of pulling up the crystal and to adjust the electric power supply for heating the crucible, so as to control the diameter of the final product. This method has a drawback, however. Since the diameter of the product is controlled in accordance with the rate that its diameter increases i.e., the speed of the crystal growth , it is difficult to desirably shape the shoulder of the crystal since the shoulder is formed while the speed is rapidly changing. Further, the larger the diameter, the more slowly the growth catches up with the changes in manufacturing conditions. The object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for manufacturing a single crystal, which can produce a single crystal with a shoulder of a desired shape, which can automatically control the diameter of the crystal from the start of crystal growth to the last step of the manufacture. According to the invention, there is provided an apparatus for manufacturing a single crystal having a diameter Do by the Czochralski method, which comprises a means for measuring the diameter D of the crystal being pulled up from a crucible a drive means for pulling up the crystal from the crucible a first speed setting means for setting the speed V1 at which the drive means is to pull up the crystal a target diameter setting means to set the target diameter DO a second speed setting means for setting the speed V2 at which to pull up the crystal by the drive means a first detecting means for detecting that the measured diameter D exceeds the value Do AD, where AD is a deviation allowance, and for outputting a first detection signal showing this fact a third speed setting means for setting the speedV3 at which to pull up the crystal by the drive means, and for controlling the speed V3 so that the diameter D may equal the control target value Di a second detecting means for detecting that the measured diameter has reached a peak value and for outputting a second detection signal showing this fact a correction means for gradually correcting the control target value Di until the value Di reaches the target diameter DO and a switching means for supplying a signal representing speed V2 to the drive means in response to the first detecting signal and a signal representing speed V3 to the drive means in response to the second detecting signal. The apparatus of the invention can automatically manufacture a single crystal with a shoulder of any desired shape and with a trunk of a predetermined diameter. The crystal made by the apparatus has no striation and is of a high quality. The apparatus needs no skilled labor. Further, it can make single crystals in a short time with a high reproducibility. It helps to reduce the material loss by 10 as compared with the known apparatus, and to enhance the production yield. In short, it increases productivity since it automatically controls the shape of the crystal being produced. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a block diagram of an apparatus according to the invention Fig. 2 is a block diagrgam illustrating how the device of Fig. 1 operates Fig. 3 is a flow chart showing how the device automatically operates Figs. 4 and 5 are graphs showing the control mode of the device and Fig. 6 is a block diagram of another apparatus according to the present invention. Fig. 1 schematically shows an apparatus of the invention for manufacturing a single crystal. The apparatus comprises a chamber 10, a crucible 12 provided in the chamber 10 and filled with molten silicon 14, and a annular heater 16 placed in the chamber 10 around the crucible 12. The chamber 10 has an opening 11 made in its top portion. A rod 22 vertically extends in the chamber 10 through this opening 11. It is slidably supported by a support not shown and provided outside the chamber 10 . It may be moved up and down by a motor 24. A seed crystal is attached to the lower end of the rod 22. The rod 22 is lowered while being rotated, thereby dipping the rotating seed crystal in the molten silicon 14. It is then lifted, thereby pulling up the crystal 20 grown on the seed crystal. A window 18 is made in the upper portion of the chamber 10. An industrial TV ITV camera 30 is so positioned as to monitor the crystal 20 through the window 18. The output signal of the camera 30 is input to a diameter measuring device 32, which measures the diameter D of the crystal 20. The output signal of the diameter measuring device 32 is converted to a digital signal by an A D converter 34. The digital signal is supplied to, and latched by, an input port 36. The output data from the input port 36 is input to a microcomputer 38. The microcomputer 38 has a CPU central processing unit 42, a RAM random access memory 40 connected toCPU 42, and a ROM read only memory 44 also connected to CPU 42. A timer 46 is connected to determine the one cycle period of the CPU 42. ROM 44 stores a program for controlling the CPU 42. The CPU 42 therefore functions according to this program during its one cycle period determined by the timer 46. More specifically, it receives the data showing the diameter D, exchanges data with the RAM 40 and calculates the most suitable speed at which to pull up the single crystal 20. The data representing this speed is supplied via an output port 48 to a D A converter 50 and is converted to an analog signal.The analog signal is input to a rotational speed controller 52, which controls the rotational speed of the motor 24 so as to lift the rod 22 at the speed calculated by the microcomputer 38. It will now be explained how the microcomputer 38 functions with reference to Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 flow chart . The CPU 42 operates as follows in accordance with the program stored in ROM 44, while exchanging data with RAM 40. The output from the diameter measuring device 32 is supplied to first and second detecting means 62 and 70 through the A D converter 34 and input port 36. The first detecting means 62 has been given data showing a target diameter Do for the crystal 20 by a target diameter setting means 66. When the measured diameter D exceeds Do AD where AD is the deviation allowance , the first detecting means 62 generates a first detection signal and supplies it to a second speed setting means 64, which outputs data representing a second pull up speed V2. This speed data is supplied to a switching means 76. The output data of a first speed setting means 60, which represents a first pull up seed V1, is arso supplied to the switching means 76.The second tection means 70 supplies a second detection signal to third speed setting means 72 when it detects that the neasured diameter reaches the peak value D. Upon receipt of the second detection signal, the third speed setting means 72 produces data showing a third pull up speed V3. The diameter previously measured by the diameter measuring device 32 is used as the peak value D when it is greater than the measured diameter D. The third speed setting means 72 controls the speed V3 so that the diameter D of the crystal 20 may equal the control target value Di. The initial value V0 for the speed V3 has been given to the third speed setting means 72.When the measured diameter D is different from the diameter Di, the third speed setting means 72 calculates the deviation allowance AV and then the output speed data V3 VO AV . AV is calculated by the PID proportional integral derivative control method. D.is input by operating a target value correction means 68 and is input to the third speed setting means 72. The initial input data from the correction means 68 is the peak value D. The means 68 varies gradually the control target value D. until it has a value nearly equal to the target diameter Dos when the former is different from the latter. For instance, it calculates the control target value Di n by correcting the previous control target value Di n l as follows Di n Di n 1 K Di n l Do ... 1 where K is a constant of proportion 0 K 1 .Di is corrected at the end of every control cycle preset by the timer 46 and gradually approaches the target diameter Do The pull up speed V3 set by the third speed setting means 72 is supplied to the switching means 76. The detection signals generated by the first and second detecting means 62, 70 are also input to a selection means 74. At first the means 76 inputs the speed V1 set by the first speed setting means 60 to a rotational speed controller 52. Upon receipt of the first detection signal, the selection means 74 actuates the switching means 76, thereby supplying speed V2 from the second speed setting means 64 to the controller 52.Upon receipt of the second detection signal, it supplies speed V3 from the third speed setting means 72 to the controller 52. It will now be described how the apparatus ofFigs. 1 and 2 is operated to manufacture a single crystal, with reference to Figs. 3 5. Fig. 3 is a flow chart Fig. 4 shows how the diameter of the crystal changes with time and Fig. 5 illustrates how the pull up speed is changed with time. First, the rod 22 with a seed crystal at its lower end is pulled from the crucible 14 at speed V1. When the program stored in the ROM 44 starts running, theCPU 42 starts operating. Its operation cycle several seconds to one minute is determined by the timer 46.In step P1, mode F 1 is input. In step P2, the diameter of the crystal measured by the diameter measuring device 32 is read in CPU 42. It is checked in step P3 what flag is set. Since F 1, the operation branches to step P4. In step P4 it is determined whether or not the measured diameter D is equal to or greater than Do AD. If D Do AD, the operation returns to step P2, whereby the speed at which the rod 22 is being pulled up is still V1 as shown in Fig. 5.Step P3 is repeated in every operation cycle of CPU 42.When the diameter D becomes equal to or gearter thanDo AD upon lapse of time tl, the answer imposed in step P4 is YES . The operation proceeds to step P5, in which speed V2 is written in CPU 42 as shown inFig. 5. In step P6, the mode is changed to F 2 . In the next operation cycle of CPU 42, D is written in RAM 40 in step S2. In step S3 it is checked what flag is set. Since F 2, the operation proceeds to step P7, in which it is determined whether or not diameter 0 is the peak value D. If D has not reached D, the operation returns to step P2. Since speed V2 is higher than speed V1, the speed of the growth of the crystal is lowered. Thereafter, the diameter D reaches the peak value D, whereby the answer asked in step P7 is YES . The operation then proceeds to step P8. In stepP8, the third pull up speed V3 is input to CPU 42. This speed V3 is of the initial value VO. Further, the control target diameter Di is set to be peak value D.In step P9, the mode is changed to F 3 . The operation returns to step P2. In the net operation cycle of CPU 42, D is written in CPU 42. In step P3, it is checked what flag is set.Since F 3, the operation goes to step P10, in which it is decided whether or not Di is nearly equal to DoZ Since D. equals to 5 and greater than DO the answer is NO . Therefore, step P11 is carried out, thereby correcting the target value D. according to the equation 1 . Thereafter, in step P12, the deviation allowanceAV is calculated by PID method. V3 is therefore set to V0 AV so that D may equal Di. In step P13, it is determined whether or not the single crystal has been pulled out of the crucible 12. If the answer is NO , the operation returns to step P2. Then, the diameter of the trunk of the single crystal is controlled again. The flag indicating that the crystal has been pulled out of the crucible 14 is set when the length of the crystal reaches a predetermined value. The length of the cyrstal is measured by a measuring device not shown . Until this flag is set, step P12, i.e., the PID process, is repeated. The control target value D.gradually decreases as step P11 is repeated. When Di becomes nearly equal to DoX the answer imposed in stepP10 is YES . Then, the operation jumps to step P12 over step Pull. Step P12 is repeated until the flag is set in step P13. The program in CPU 42 then stops running. Ten single crystals of silicon were manufactured by means of the apparatus according to the invention. The crucible 12 was made of quartz and had an inner diameter of 300 mm. About 5 Kg of silicon was put into the crucible 12 and heated by the heater 16 until it was melted. Speed V1, speed V2, and speed V0 initial value input to the microcomputer 38 were 25 mm hour, 200 mm hour and 60 mm hour, respectively. The target diameter Do of 80 mm and the deviation allowance AD of 10 mm had been input to the microcomputer 38. Each single crystal was made in the following manner. The pull rod 22 with a seed crystal was lowered until the seed crystal was fully dipped in the molten silicon 14. Thereafter, a Dash s neck was formed. The rod 22 was pulled up at 25 mm hour. At the same time, the temperature of the molten silicon was reduced to lower the output voltage of the pyrometer, which was used to detect said temperature, by approximately 100 microvolts. Consequently, the crystal grew, forming its shoulder. Thirty minutes t1 after the start of the pulling of the rod 22, the crystal had a diameter of 70 mm and the pull up speed had increased to 200 mm hour. Upon a lapse of 3 minutes, the peak value D was reached and the pull up speed was reduced to 60 mm hour. Thereafter, the diameter of the crystal was controlled by the PID method, and a single crystal of silicon, about 4 Kg, was manufactured. The ten cyrstals had no concaves or projections in their shoulders. Their trunks had a diameter of 80 0.4 mm. It was found that the diameter of each crystal and the shape of the shoulder thereof were automatically controlled to become substantially identical with the designed shape and designed diameter. Hence, the yield was good. Another embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Fig. 6. This embodiment has no microcomputer it uses a combination of analog circuits to control the speed of pulling up a crystal. In Fig. 6, the device for pulling up the crystal is not shown. Like the embodiment of Fig. 1, the appartatus ofFig. 6 comprises a motor 24, a rotational speed controller 52, an ITV camera 30 and a diameter measuring device 32. The output signal from the device 32 is input to a pull up speed control circuits 80 and 82 and also to a diameter control circuit 84. The pull up speed control circuit 80 has a device 88 for setting the target diameter Do, a device 86 for setting a deviation allowance AD, and a comparator for comparing Do AD with the measured diameter D of the crystal. The comparator 90 generates a first detection signal when D is equal to, or greater than, DO AD. This signal is supplied to a gate 92. A second pull up speed V2 is input from a speed setting device 94.Upon receipt of the first detection signal, the gate 92 supplies the output of the device 94 to the rotational speed controller 52. The pull up speed control circuit 82 comprises a peak diameter detector 96, a comparator 98, a gate 100, and a pull up speed setting device 102. The detector 96 detects and holds the peak diameter 0. The comparator 98 is used to compare the output of the detector 96 withD. When D falls below the output value of the peak diameter detector 96, the comparator 98 supplies a second detection signal to the gate 100. Upon receipt of this signal, the gate 100 selects the initial valueV0 for speed V3, which has been set by the pull up speed setting device 102. V0 is input to the rotational speed controller 52. The output of the comparator 98, i.e., the second detection signal, is also input to the gate 92, turning off the same, whereby only V V0 is fed from the gate 100 to the controller 52. The diameter control circuit 84 comprises a hold circuit 104, a device 106 for setting the control target value Di, an integrator 108, and a PID controller 110.When the peak diameter D is detected, the comparator 98 produces the second detection signal of the comparator 98 is also input to the hold circuit 104 and the peak diameter D is latched. D is supplied to the device 106. Di and D are input to the PID controller 110. The PID controller 110 starts the PID control. The output V from the controller 110 is added to the output VO from the pull up speed setting device 102. The sum, V VO, is supplied to the speed controller 52 through the gate 100. When the outputs of the devices 88 and 106 are not equal, the integrator 108 functions, thus correcting the control target diameter Di. The extent of this correction is adjusted by the time constant of the integrator 108. The embodiment shown in Fig. 6 was operated in the same mode as the embodiment of Fig. 1. It was proved to automatically control the shape of the shoulder of a single crystal and the diameter thereof. The apparatus served to manufacture single crystals of high quality with a high yield.
