# PROCESS FOR RECOVERING RUBBERLIKE POLYMER FROM SOLUTION THEREOF

## Abstract
In a process for recovering a rubberlike copolymer from a hydrocarbon or halogenated hydrocarbon solution con taining the copolymer, the solution being obtained by copolymerizing ethylene and an α olefin represented by the general formula CH₂ CHR, wherein R is a linear or a branched alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or by copolymerizing these and a non conjugated linear or cyclic diene, presence of a catalyst containing an organoalu minum compound and a vanadium compound, the improve ment which compriese dispersing the rubber like copolymer solution in hot water in the presence of a block type polyether compound represented by the general formula HO C₂H₄O
