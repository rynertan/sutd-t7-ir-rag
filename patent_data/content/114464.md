# Coupler for modular wiring systems.

## Abstract
A modular tricoupler 30 is provided for interconnecting lengths of inside wiring in series within walls, for example, of customer premises. The tricoupler also includes provisions for receiving a modular plug 31 which terminates a cord that is connected to customer station equipment. The tricoupler includes a housing 80 having first and second generally opposed plug receiving cavities 82, 83 and a third cavity 87 . A plurality of metallic wire like contact elements 90 are disposed in the housing of the tricoupler and maintained spaced apart by partitions 96 . One end portion of each contact element extends into the second cavity and the other end portion into the third cavity. Blade like terminals 60 of a modular plug which is inserted into the first cavity engage loop portions 131 of the contact elements. The loop portion of each is designed and is supported so that the entire loop shifts when engaged by the terminal. This arrangement allows sufficient deflection of the loop portions to develop suitable contact pressure with terminals of plugs inserted into the cavities without causing a permanent deformation of the wire like contact elements.
