# An output processing system for a digital electronic musical instrument.

## Abstract
An output processor for an electronic musical instrument is characterised by a data distribution network interconnect ing data processing means and data storage means, wherein at least one such data storage means stores data from which a waveform of the desired sound may be derived means for producing a plurality of microinstructions from which sets of data flow control signals may be derived, said data flow con trol signals determining the source and destination of data being handled by said distribution network and means for storage and retrieval of a program of said microinstructions, said program effecting control of data flow in a manner such as to allow the generation of the desired sound. Preferably said program effects control of data flow in a manner which allows the substantialiy simultaneous generation of a plural ity of waveforms.
