# Forming a gob of molten glass into a parison.

## Abstract
A plunger mechanism for use in forming a gob of molten glass into a parison comprises a cylinder 30 , a piston 32 movable in the cylinder upon the introduction of hydraulic fluid, a piston rod 34 , means 40 for mounting a plunger on the piston rod, a servo mechanism 58 to control the flow of fluid, a position or velocity feedback device 60 , and control means 70 responsive to the feedback device operable to control the servo mechanism so that the plunger moves with a predetermined position against time curve.
