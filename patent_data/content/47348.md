## Description
DESCRIPTION APPARATUS FOR DRAWING FILAMENTARY POLYMERIC MATERIAL The present invention relates to the manutacture of synthetic filamentary polymeric structures. In particular, it relates to the stretching of the filamentary polymeric structures without any operator exposure to moving rollers during string up from source to take up. Stretched filaments of synthetic high polymers have been conventionally produced in good yields for many years in two distinct process stages, which are separated from one another in respect of both space and time, That is to say, spinning is first accomplished, generally at speeds up to about 1000 to 1200 meters per minute, followed by a separate drawing step which is accomplished on a draw twisting or draw winding machine.A more recently developed method of obtaining stretched filaments of synthetic high polymers comprehends spinning and stretching continuously, as in the so called spindraw processes, the latest modifications of which continuously combine spinning, stretching, and winding with interlacing or intermingling and or texturizing.Similarly the so called draw texturizing processes continuously combine stretching and winding with texturizing and interlacing . Exemplary of the aforementioned processes are the inventions disclosed in the following patents U.S. 2,289,860 U050 3,452,130 U.S. 4,035,464 U.S. 3,555,808 and U.S. 3,448,186. Notwithstanding the efficacy of these and similar processes involving the drawing of filamentary polymeric material, they are all found wanting in one important aspect viz., string up from source to take up is not simply and efficiently accomplished, especially in coupled processes, and there is considerable operator exposure to rollers moving a very high speeds. The present invention, which obviates these difficulties and inadequacies of the prior art, is nowhere disclosed or remotely suggested by any of the processes or devices of the prior art. According to the present invention there is provided a device for drawing filamentary polymeric material, characterised by a roller assembly comprising at least three rollers, at least two of which are motorized, the rollers being spaced from each other in a first position providiing for passage of.filamentary polymeric material in a straight line from a source of supply thereof through the space between the rollers and thence to a means for winding the filamentary polymeric material into a package on a support and means for moving at least one of the rollers to a second position providing for contact of the filamentary polymeric material with the surface of each motorized roller over a surface angle of less than 3600 whereby the filamentary polymeric material adheres to the surfaces of the motorized rollers without slippage and is drawn between the upstream. and downstream motorized rollers when these rollers are caused to move into position, to effect string up from source to take up simply and without any operator exposure to moving rollers0 As a result, the filamentary polymeric material adheres to the surfaces of the motorized rollers without slippage and is drawn between the upstream and downstream motorized rollers when these rollers are caused to move.String up from source to take up has been effected simply and efficiently and without.any operator exposure to moving rollers, and the device has been advanced into the operation mode, free of any complexity. An especially desirable and preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a device for drawing filamentary polymeric material comprising first and second ruller turrets spaced from each other, each roller turret comprising to motorized rollers which are spaced from each other and communicate with each other by means of a cross member joining the shafts thereof, the motorized rollers of the first turret being designed to operate at a surface velocity of V1 and V2 respectively, and the motorized rollers of the second turret being designed to operate at a surface velocity of V3 and V4 respectively, wherein V1 V2, V3V4, and V2 V the roller turrets having a first position providing for passage of filamentary polymeric material from a source of supply thereof through the space between the motorized rollers of the first turret, thence through the space between the motorized rollers of the second turret, and thence to a means for winding the filamentary polymeric material into a package on a support and means for rotating each roller turret in either a clockwise or couierclockwise direction through an angle less than 360 to a second position providing for contact.of the filamentary polymeric material with the surface of each motorized roller over a surface angle of less than 3600. For the very best results, the surfaces of the motorized rollers should have a surface roughness height index value of 32 RMS or less0 When the aforementioned preferred embodiment of the present invention is employed, filamentary polymeric material is wound into a package at speeds up to and including 6,000 meters per minute. Moreover, it has been found to be especially advantageous in the employment of the aforementioned preferred embodiment of the present invention if such embodiment additionally comprises a sensing means positioned downstream from the second roller turret for the detection of a break in the moving threadline of the filamentary polymeric material ccupled with b inter rutting means for stopping the rotation of the motorized rollers and returning the roller turrets to the first defined position thereof. It is very convenient in the utilization of the aforementioned preferred embodiment of the present invention if the roller turrets thereof are rotated from the first to the second defined position thereof through an angle of about 2500 and most collveniently if the first roller turret is rotated in a counterclockwise direction, and the second roller turret is rotated in a clockwise direction. Under such conditions, optimum results are conveniently achieved when the surface velocities of the motorized rollers are defined by the following relationships V1 V2 VD V4 and V2 c V3. The present invention will now be described further, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a perspective view, schematically representing an especially preferred embodiment of the present invention in a first defined position thereof, as hereinafter explained in detail Fig. 2 is a perspective view schematically representing the same embodiment in a second defined position thereof, as hereinafter explained in detail and Fig. 3 is a side view, schematically representing the embodiment of Figs. 1 and 2, which is provided with additional cooperative components. Referring now to the Drawings, a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention 1 is shown in Figs, 1 and 2. The embodiment comprises first roller turret lea and second roller turret 1b .Roller turret 1a has two motorized rollers A and B , which are spaced from each other and communicate with each other by means of cross m.ember 2 , joining shafts 4 of rollers A and B . Roller turret 1b has two motorized rollers C and D , which are spaced from each other and communicates with each other by means of cross member 21 , joining shafts 4 of rollers C and D . Motorized roller A is designed to operate at a surface velocity cf V1 motorized roller B , of V2 motorized roller C , of V3 and motorized roller D , of V4.Surface velocity V1 is less than or equal toV2 surface velocity Vf is less than or equal to V4 andV2 is less than V3. Fig. 1 depicts roller turrets 1a and 1b being disposed in a first position providing for passage of filamentary polymeric material 8 from a source of supply thereof not shown through the space between motorized rollers A and B , thence through the space between motorized rollers ç and D , and thence to a means for winding the filamentary polymeric material into a package on a support not shown . By means of pivots 3 and 31 , roller turrets 1 at and Ib are caused to rotate to a second position as shown in Fig. 2. The rotation of the individual roller turrets may be either in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. In Fig. 2, roller turret lea is shown as having been rotated in a counterclockwise direction, and roller turret 1b is shown as having been rotated in a clockwise direction, presenting a configuration which is very conveniently and advantageously employed.The rotation of each roller turret should be through an angle of less than 360 . Fig. 2 shows the rotation of roller turret 1a through an angle of about 250 and the rotation of roller turret Ib through an angle of about 2500, presenting a configuration which has been found to be especially useful. As a result of rotation of the individual roller turrets to the second position thereof, filamentary polymeric material 8 is caused te contact the surface of the motorized rollers over a surface angle of less t,han 3600, as seen in iligo 2.When rollers A , 3 , C , and D caused to rotate at surface velocities V1, V2, V3, and V4, respectively, as hereinbefore set forth, filamentary polymeric material a adheres to the surfaces of the motorized rollers without slippage and is drawn between the first and second roller turrets. Especially good results are achieved when the surfaces of the motorized rollers have a surface roughness height index value of 32 RMS less, and most advantageously 10 RMS or less.Under such conditions, filamentary polymeric material 8 is drawn and wound bnto a package at speeds up to and including 6,000 meters per minute. For special conveni pence in operation and very advantageous results, the following relationships have been determined V1 V2, within the range 500 m nin to 3700 m min V3 V4, within the range 1800 m min to 4700 m min V2 being in any event less than V. The filamentary polymeric material 8 is ordinarily treated with water or an appropriate standard finish composition before being stretched in a device according to the present invention. Referring now to Fig. 3, there is shown the same embodiment depicted in Xligso 1 and 2, except that there are additional elements cooperating in the basic combination. In particular, sensing means 5 , which is positioned downstream from the second roller.turret, detects any interruption in the moving threadline o the filamentary polymeric material 8 . Such sensing means, which are usually based upon photoelectric, capacitance, or pneumatic principles, are readily available commercially. The output signal from such sensing means 5 , which is indicated by the dotted line emanating therefrom, is transmitted to interruptIng means 7 , which stops the rotation of the individual motorized rollers and effects the return of the roller turrets to their first defined position, as set forth hereinabove.Such mechanisms are readily available commercially.In addition, the output signal from sensing means 5 may be transmitted to standard cutting means 6 , which severs the threadline of the filamentary polymeric material 8 , in order to prevent fouling of the motorized rollers and to facilitate a subsequent stringup procedure,
