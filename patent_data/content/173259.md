# Antimicrobial suspensions and antimicrobial hair treatment compositions.

## Abstract
A polyvalent metal salt of 2 mercaptopyridine N oxide Mept compound is dispersed in water by aid of a specific dispersant selected from the group consisting of A , B and C A A polyglycol polyamine condensation polymer, polyglycol polyamine alkylamine condensation polymer or alkyleneamine condensation polymer B At least one water soluble polymer compound selected from the group consisting of hydroxyalkylcelluloses and partly quaternarized products thereof, and at least one non ionic sur factant C At least one cationic polymer compound and at least one inorganic salt. The resulting suspension has improved stability and is ap plicable to shampooes, hair rinses and the like.
