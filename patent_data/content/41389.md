## Description
DESCRIPTION WRAP AROUND HEAT RECOVERABLE SLEEVES This invention relates to heat recoverable wraparound sleeves and to the installation of such sleeves on elongate substrates to form a sealed leak proof enclosure around a portion of the elongate substrate. Wraparound heat recoverable, or heat shrinkable, polymeric sleeves are frequently used to protect portions of elongate substrates, such as cables. Wraparound heat recoverable sleeves generally comprise a heat shrinkable polymeric sheet which can be wrapped around the elongate substrate.The longitudinal edges of the sleeve are held together bysuitable means and heat is applied to cause the sleeve to shrink into intimate contact with the substrate. The sleeve can be used, for example, over splices between cables or over sections of the cable where additional protection is desired, for example where the cable insulation has been damaged or removed for some reason. The heat shrinkable sleeves are generally coated on one side thereof, the side which becomes the inner surface of the sleeve, with a heat activatable adhesive, such as a hot melt adhesive or the like. Application of heat to cause the sleeve to shrink into contact with the substrate also activates the adhesive so that the sleeve becomes bonded to the substrate. During the heat recovery or heat shrinking step, the longitudinal edges of the sleeve must be secured together.Several ways of retaining the edges together are taught in .lye art. A particularly useful approach is that disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,455,336 to Ellis, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The heatshrinkable sleeve is provided with an integral rail along each longitudinal edge and when the longitudinal edges are brought together the rails can be utilized to hold the edges together. This is usually accomplished by means of a channel placed over the abutting rails. If desired, one of the rails can be set back from the longitudinal edge to form a flap which provides an area of overlap when the edges are brought together. Other means for holding a wraparound heat recoverable sleeve together during the heat recovery step are disclosed in the art. See, for example, U.S.Patent Nos. 3,379,218 to Conde, 3,530,898 to Wilson and 3,574,313 to Tanaka, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. It is also possible to overlap the longitudinal edges and hold them together with an adhesive. This is generally not as satisfactory as, for example, the rail and channel system described above, as most contact adhesives are not strong enough to withstand the stresses created during heat recovery of the sleeve. In the installation of heat recoverable sleeves of this type, the heat applied should be adequate to activate the adhesive over the entire inner surface of the sleeve. It has been found in practice that sufficient heat is not always applied during installation with the result that the protective enclosure formed by the heatrecovered sleeve leaks. Use of a thermochromic paint on at least a portion of the outer surface of the sleeve to detect when the sleeve has reached a particular temperature is one proposed solution to this problem. It has been observed that in installing a wraparound sleeve of the type which includes a longitudinal rail closure means or which includes an area of overlap when the longitudinal edges are brought together, the adhesive immediately under the rail or overlap takes longer to heat. As a result if insufficient heat is not applied this area is likely not to bond to the substrate.It has been found that if this area is coated with a strip of colored or pigmented heat flowable adhesive, adequate heating of the sleeve is readily detected. When sufficiently heated, the pigmented adhesive flows from the ends of the sleeve and is visible to the installer. Thus, one aspect of this invention comprises a heat recoverable wraparound sleeve comprising an elongate, heat recoverable flexible sheet, said sheet having opposed longitudinal edges and being capable of being positioned about an elongate substrate such that the longitudinal edges of said sheet form an area of greater thickness than said sheet thereby facilitating retaining said edges in intimate contact along their length, a layer of a heat activatable adhesive on one surface of said sheet and at least one strip of pigmented adhesive capable of flowing upon application of heat and positioned such that when said sheet is placed about an elongate substrate, said strip is on the innermost surface of said area of greater thickness. The heat recoverable flexible sheet is made of a material capable of having the property of plastic or elastic memory imparted thereto which is heated to above its crystalline melting temperature and expanded under pressure to configuration greater than its normal configuration and then cooled while kept under pressure. A heat recoverable article treated in this manner will retain its expanded position until it is again heated to its crystal .. line melting temperature at which time it will recover to its original shape. Examples of such heat recoverable materials may be found in Currie Patent No. 2,027,962 andCook et al. Patent No. 3,086,242, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Polymeric materials which have been cross linked by chemical means or by irradiation, for example, with high energy electrons or nuclear radiation, are preferred for use in preparing the heat recoverable flexible sheet. Non crystalline polymeric materials exhibiting the property of plastic or elastic memory, such as polyurethane, ionomers, etc. can also be used, if desired, The inner surface of the heat recoverable flexible sheet is coated with a heat activatable adhesive so that an adhesive bond is formed between the heat recovered sleeve and the substrate after the sheet has been installed.The adhesive is preferably a hot melt adhesive but other heat activatable adhesives, such as heat activatable mastics and the like, can be used. Hot melt adhesives for this use are well known. Particularly suitable adhesives are those described in U.S. Patents No. 3,983,075 to nonneck, 4,018,733 to Lopez et al., 4,117,027 to Johnson rt al. and 4,181,775 to Corke, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Such adhesives typically comprise polyamides of relatively low molecular weight, various olefin polymers or copolymers, waxes, tackifiers, antioxidants, etc. The particular adhesive used will depend in part by the material used for the heat recoverable sleeve and the material or materials forming the outermost surface of the substrate.The heat recoverable sleeve can bond directly to the substrate such as a metal pipe or conduit, or to an insulation layer as is generally found on an electrical cable. A protective casing such as a metal inner shell as described in US.Patent No. 4,142,592 to Brusselmans can be used. The wraparound sleeves bond to this inner shell as well as to the underlying substrate. The adhesive is generally applied to that side of the heat recoverable flexible sheet which becomes the inner surface of the sleeve on installation. The adhesive can be applied by conventional techniques such as extrusion coating, laminating, brushing and other coating procedures.To ensure creation of a leak proof seal between the recovered sleeve and substrate, the adhesive is coated substantially uniformly over the entire surface. In accordance with this invention at least one strip of pigmented adhesive is applied to the inner surface under the area of the sheet, generally the flap or rail area, which on installation has the greatest thickness. This strip of adhesive can be applied by any of the same conventional techniques. The strip can extend along the entire length of this area or, alternatively, smaller crips can be applied to the inner surface adjacent the ends of the sheet. The pigmented adhesive is preferably of the same adhesive formulation as the adhesive coated over the entire inner surface. However, the pigmented adhesive can be of any formulation which is compatible with the other coated on the surface.For example, it may be desirable to use an adhesive having a higher flow temperature than the first adhesive so that greater heat will be required to cause the pigmented adhesive to flow thereby providing greater assurance that adequate heat has been applied to activate the adhesive over the entire inner surface of the sleeve. This in turn provides that the sleeve will be completely bonded to the substrate forming a leak proof enclosure. In a prefered embodiment the heat recoverable flexible sheet is provided with a pair of closure rails.One of the rails is along one longitudinal edge and the other is set back from the other longitudinal edge to provide a flap. During installation, the rails are held together by means of a channel. In this case, the pigmented adhesive is placed on the inner surface of the sheet under the rail set back from the longitudinal edge, since this will be the innermost surface under the rails when the sleeve is installed. In another preferred embodiment, the longitudinal edges of the sheet are overlapped and held in place with a contact adhesive during the installation and heat recovery process. In this case the pigmented adhesive is placed on the inner surface of the sheet adjacent the longitudinal edge which will be innermost during installation. Turning now to the drawings, in Figure 1, a heat shrinkable sheet, 1, of cross linked polyethylene is provided with a pair of rails, 2 and 3, which abut one another when the sheet is wrapped around a substrate during installation. Rail, 2, is offset from the edge of the sheet forming a flap, 4. A channel not shown slides over the abutting rails to hold them closed during installation. The inner surface, that is the surface shown in Figure 1, is coated over its entire surface with a hot melt adhesive composition of the type disclosed in the above mentionedU.S. Patent to Corke. Strips, 5 and 6, are of pigmented adhesive of the same adhesive formulation, and containing 0.06 of a violet pigment Monostral 899D commercially available from E. I. duPont de Nemours . The strips are placed under the rail, 2, and flap, 4. During installation of the sheet as a wraparound sleeve, heat will cause the pigmented adhesive to flow beyond the open ends of the sleeve. Figure 2 illustrates the heat recoverable sheet, 1, of Figure 1 after it has been installed around substrate, 7. Rails, 2 and 3, are held together during installation by channel, 8. Strip, 5, of pigmented adhesive is on the innermost surface of the sheet, 1, adjacent the end of the sheet.
