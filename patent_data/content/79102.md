# Coloured aqueous alkalimetal hypochlorite compositions.

## Abstract
The invention pertains to coloured aqueous alkalimetal hypochlorite compositions which are suitable for bleaching purposes. By inclusion in such compositions of a halogen ated metalphthalocyanine pigment having from 6 to 16 halogen atoms per molecule of phthalocyanine, the colour remains stable much longer than when a metal phthalocyanine is used having from 0 to 6 halogen atoms, at an alkalimetalhypochlorite level of 5 15 by weight. Inclusi on of a metal complexing agent improves the chemical stability of the coloured composition. A preferred embodi ment is a coloured thicknened alkalimetalhypochlorite com position.
