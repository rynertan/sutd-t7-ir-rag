Illustrative of the adjuvants which may be incorporated in tablets, capsules and the like are the following a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin an excipient such as dicalcium phosphate a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like a lubricant such as magnesium stearate a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen or cherry. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain in addition to materials of the above type a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propyl parabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Sterile compositions for injection can be formulated according to conventional pharmaceutical practice by dissolving or suspending the active substance in a vehicle such as water for injection, a naturally occurring vegetable oil like sesame oil, coconut oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, etc., or a synthetic fatty vehicle like ethyl oleate, and the like. Buffers, preservatives, antioxidants and the like can be incorporated as required. Specific embodiments of the invention are illustrated in the following examples. EXAMPLE I To a mixture containing 15.5 gm 0.075 mol of N, Nt dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in 200 ml of methylene chloride at 50C was added dropwise a solution containing 16.3 gm sequence inhibit angiotensin I converting enzyme and therefore are useful in reducing or relieving hypertension. Furthermore, the compounds within the scope of the present invention which possess diuretic activity promote relief from hypertension by promoting diuresis, and consequently have utility in treating congestive heart failure. Compounds within the scope of this invention can also simultaneously possess ACE inhibitory and diuretic activity, which is particularly unexpected in view of the fact that such simultaneous activity cannot be predicted from prior art compounds. Thus by the administration of a composition containing one or a combination of compounds of formula 1 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, hypertension in the species of mammal suffering therefrom is alleviated. A single dose, or preferably two or four divided daily doses, provided on a basis of about 0.1 to 100 mg per kilogram per day, preferably about 1 to 50 mg per kilogram per day, is appropriate to reduce blood pressure. The substance is preferably administered orally, but a parenteral route such as subcutaneously, intranuscularly, intravenously or intraperitonealy can also be employed. The compounds of the invention can be utilized to achieve the reduction of blood pressure by formulating one or more of them in compositions such as tablets, capsules or elixirs for oral administration or in sterile solutions or suspensions for parenteral administration. About .10 to 500 mg of a compound or mixture of compounds of formula I or physiologically acceptable salt s thereof is compounded with a physiologically acceptable vehicle, carrier, excipient, binder, preservative, stabilizer, flavor, etc., in a unit dosage form as called for by accepted pharmaceutical pracice. The amount of active substance in these compositions or The products are sometimes obtained as a mixture of diasteroisomers which can be separated by standard methods of fractional crystallization or chromatography. The compounds of this invention form acid salts with various inorganic and organic acids which are also within the scope of the invention. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the present invention may be prepared by conventional reactions by reacting the free amino acid or amino ester with an appropriate acid providing the desired anion, either in a solvent or medium in which the salt is insoluble, or in water and removing the water by freezedrying. The salts of strong acids are preferred. As exemplary, but not limiting, of pharmaceutically acceptable acid salts are the salts of hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric, acetic, fumaric, malic, maleic and citric acids. The compounds of this invention also form salts with bases. Suitable such salts include salts with alkali and alkaline earth metals such as sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium, as well as iron, and salts with ammonia and amines, and quaternary ammonium salts. The action of the enzyme renin or angiotensinogen, a pseudoglobulin in blood plasma, produces the decapeptide angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is converted by angiotensin converting enzyme ACE to the octapeptide angiotensin II. The latter is an active pressor substance which has been implicated as the causative agent in various forms of hypertension in various mammalian species, e.g., rats and dogs. The compounds within the scope of this invention which intervene in the renin to angiotensin I to angiotensin II In the condensation of an alpha haloacid derivative, similar reaction conditions, solvents and hydrogen halide acceptors can be used as for amide formation. Various substituents on the present new compounds can be present in the starting compounds or added after formation of the amide products by the known methods of substitution or conversion reactions. Thus, the nitro group can be added to the finai product by nitration of the aromatic ring and the nitro group converted to other groups, such as amino by reduction, and halo by diazotization of the amino group and replacement of the diazo group. Other reactions can be effected on the formed amide product. Amino groups can be alkylated to form mono and dialkylamino groups, mercapto and hydroxy groups can be alkylated to form corresponding ethers. Thus, substitution or alteration reactions can be employed to provide a variety of substituents throughout the molecule of the final products. Of course, reactive groups where present should be protected by suitable blocking groups during any of the aforesaid reactions particularly the condensation reactions to form the amide linkages. If the product of any of the above routes has one or more protecting groups, those groups are now removed, for instance with trifluoroacetic acid, or zinc in acetic acid, or basic hydrolysis, or other means appropriate for the particular protecting group chosen. If desired, ester groups in the Y position are converted to the free acid with a commonly known reagent such as HCl or NaOH. Each of the above reactions proceeds in a straight forward manner in a suitable solvent at temperatures ranging from OOC to 150 C.
