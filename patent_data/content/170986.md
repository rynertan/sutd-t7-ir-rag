# A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF COPOLYCARBONATES OF SULFONYL DIPHENOL

## Abstract
The present invention is directed to a continuous process for the preparation of copolycarbonates of sulfonyl diphenol SDP containing at least about 15, preferably about 15 to about 80 percent by weight of SDP and characterized in the particular system catalyzing the process reaction. The inven tion thus entails improvements and modifications to the known interfacial polycondensation process rendering it applicable to the preparation of copolycarbonates containing a high level of SDP comprising a combination of catalysts namely a phase transfer catalyst and a condensation catalyst.
