# Apparatus for providing a demodulated synchro output signal.

## Abstract
A synchro resolver angular position sensor provides the sine and cosine of angular position by applying a square wave excitation from an amplifier 27 to the rotor winding 19 of a resolver 18. The corresponding square wave outputs of the sine and cosine windings of the resolver stator 20 are sampled in time synchronism with the excitation at a predetermined time phase of the square wave excitation cycle. The sampled sine and cosine amplitudes are converted into digital format via an analog to digital converter 33, 34, for application to a digital processor. The upper corners of the positively going leading edges and the lower corners of the negatively going leading edges of the square wave excitation waveform are rounded to minimise ringing of the sine and cosine square wave outputs from the resolver 18.
