# Trip apparatus.

## Abstract
In trip apparatus of the type wherein a trip signal applied to the trip apparatus inputs by an input field circuit causes the output signal, applied by the trip apparatus outputs to the output field circuit, to change the health of the input and or output field circuits is monitored to detect malfunction, or potential malfunctions, resulting from e.g. abnormal field circuit resistance, earth leakage and or application of high voltages, by monitoring the potential difference across the trip apparatus inputs and or outputs and or between said inputs and or outputs and earth, so that an alarm signal is given should the monitored potential difference vary from within preset limits.
