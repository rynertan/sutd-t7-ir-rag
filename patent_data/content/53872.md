# Spring latch and hinge assembly for closure members.

## Abstract
A spring latch and hinge assembly for closure members generally on containers such as compacts for powder and other cosmetics includes spaced hinge elements 24a, 24b, 122a, 122b on one peripheral side of the closure or cover member and base members to permit pivotal movement of the closure or cover member from open to closed position relative the base member and resilient elements 26, 112r alternatively on the base member or the closure member whose resilience is a function of the coefficient of elasticity of the materials from which the closure or cover member and base member are made said resilient elements disposed between the spaced hinge members and constructed with a designed resistance to closing which compresses the resi lient element and establishes a predetermined expansion force therein to resist opening of the closure or cover member from the closed position. The closing and opening movement of the closure member produces an audible clicking sound by the resilient elements.
