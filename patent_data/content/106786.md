## Description
AIR WATER MIXING NOZZLE. This invention relates to an air water mixing nozzle suitable for use in spa baths or the like. Air water mixing nozzles are commonly used in spa baths or spa pools of the type where air is mixed with water and injected into the bath under pressure to provide a massage jet effect and to aerate the bath. In this specification the term spa bath is to be taken to include all similar constructions of this type including spa pools and other similar arrangements. It is desirable to provide an air water mixing nozzle which enables the aerated water to be injected a considerable distance into the body of water in the spa bath without the need for excessive pressure in the. water supply or the use of auxiliary pressure air pumping. Previous air water mixing nozzles have used a central air inlet around which water is passed under pressure in a venturi effect to entrain air with the water and inject the air water mixture into the bath. Such systems have the disadvantages that they are expensive to manufacture and that they frequently do not achieve the desired air to water ratio. It has also been found difficult to get a required penetration of the air water mixture into the bath from nozzles of this type. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an air water mixing nozzle which will obviate or minimize the foregoing disadvantages in a simple yet effective manner. The invention provides an air water mixing nozzle including an inlet 10 for water, a jet 6 for supplying water from said inlet to an air water mixing chamber 5 having an air inlet 16 , and an outlet 13 from said mixing chamber 5 characterized in that a fairing member 12 is provided in said inlet 10 , said fairing member 12 serving to direct the flow of water to said jet 6 . One preferred form of the invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to. the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a plan view of a nozzle according to the invention, Fig. 2 is a cross sectional elevation on the line 2 2 of Fig. 1, Fig. 3 is an enlarged cross sectional elevation scrap view of the mounting of the jet within the outlet nozzle, and Fig. 4 is a vertical cross section on the line 4 4 of Fig. 2. In the illustrated form of the invention an air water mixing nozzle for a spa bath is constructed as follows The spa bath has a wall member 1 and a water supply pipe 2 which is typically arranged around the perimeter of the outside of the bath following the position of desired placement of the air water mixing nozzles. At desired locations along the pipe 2 air water mixing nozzles 3 are provided which are conveniently inserted into the pipe by way of T pieces 4. The pipe 2 and the T pieces 4 are conveniently plastic pipe fittings of a known type. An air inlet 16 is provided into the chamber 5 and in the preferred form of the invention the air inlet comprises an upwardly extending conduit 17 which is open to the atmosphere at its upper end 18. In a typical application the air inlet conduit 17 extends upwardly to the upper flange not shown of the spa bath where is terminates in a simple air inlet control valve. The adjustable nozzle outlet 15 comprises a cylindrical socket 19 in which is mounted a jet.20 having a spherical outer surface 21. The diameter of the jet 20 is slightly less than the diameter of the socket.l9 so that the jet forms a sliding and tilting fit within the socket. The jet is mounted within the socket by way of two sealing rings 22 and 23 which are wedged shaped in cross section and serve to support and seal the jet within the cylinder 19. The cylinde is provided a first flange 24 and a second flange 25 and a compression spring 26 axially arranged within the cylinder.The first sealing ring 22 abuts the first flange 24 and the second sealing ring 23 is held in position by an axial force provided by the spring 26 acting between the ring 23 and the second flange 25. The entire nozzle outlet 15 is conveniently located within the remainder of the nozzle by a screw thread 27. The nozzle outlet jet 20 incorporates a central passage 28 therethrough for the passage of water and air from tbe chamber 5 to the interior 14 of the spa bath. The passage 28 is preferably circular in cross section .and converging from its inlet end adjacent the chamber 5 to its outlet end 29. The air water mixing nozzle 3 operates as follows.Water entering inlet 10 impinges on fairing member 12, which serves to direct water passing through inlet into the central jet 6, from which it issues at high velocity into the chamber 5. In chamber 5, air from inlet 16 is mixed with water which spreads out into chamber 5 after being injected from jet 6.The air water mix then exits through converging nozzle central passage 28 at high velocity. Central jet element 6 is adjustable, as described hereinbefore. Adjustment towards outlet 29 results in less air being entrained in the water, and adjustment away from the outlet results in more air being entrained. The air water mixing nozzle 3 includes a pipe 9 extends into main pipe 2, the pipe being provided with an inlet 10. A crossbar 11 Fig. 4 is provided across inlet 10, and on the crossbar 11 is mounted a fairing member 12, which may typically be conical in configuration. Adjustably mounted within pipe 9 is a central jet element 6. The element 6 has external screw threads which co operate with internal screw threads on pipe 9 such that rotation of element 6 will advance it towards inlet 10 or retract it from the inlet. The central jet 6 has a converging inlet portion 8 which communicates with a reduced diameter in comparison with the diameter of pipe 9 aperture 7, which itself communicates with an air water mixing chamber 5. The chamber 5 has an outlet 13 located directly opposite the jet 6, and the outlet 13 communicates with the interior 14 of a spa bath by way of an adjustable outlet nozzle 15. In this manner an air water mixing nozzle for a spa bath is provided which has been found to be extremely effective in mixing air with water and capable of achieving a higher air water ratio than has been achieved with previous nozzles. The nozzle has also been found to give a greater penetration of the air water mixture into the spa bath than previously achieved which results in a superior massage effect and greater aeration of the water within the spa bath. The adjustable nozzles outlet has been found to be simple and therefore cheap to manufacture and result in an adjustable nozzle which is simple to operate, as the jet 20 can turn and tilt freely within the cylinder 19, and furthermore has a long life with little component wear.
