# Semipermeable membranes based on polymers containing sulphonate groups.

## Abstract
Semipermeable membrane consisting of a polymer, embodying SO₃ groups said SO₃ groups may be pre sent in the continuous polymer chains or may be present in links between continuous polymer chains. The membrane may have been formed either by in situ coagulation of a polymer solution in the pores of a porous substrate or by interfacial crosslinking of a water soluble phe nolic polymer with a sulphonyl halide compound to form an SO₃ groups embodying polymer in the pores of a subs trate.
