# DYNAMIC MICROSCOPE IMAGE PROCESSING SCANNER

## Abstract
An image scanner has a microscope with a high precision computer controlled motor driven stage to provide X, Y plane displacements in order to scan microscopic objects under the microscope. There is an image sensor 12 and a digitiser 13 in association with the microscope to sense a horizontal image line or a two dimensional image and provide a digital represen tation of the line or image. A digital signal processor 3 processes digitized signals from the sensor. There is a com puter 4 to control the mechanical and electronic scanning and to store and display information from the digital signal proces sor. Methods of scanning a microscopic object comprise posi tioning the object on a motorized stage of a microscope having an image sensor in a focal plane. The object is scanned and sig nals received from the sensor during scanning are digitized. The digitized signals are processed with a digital signal proces sor in order to automatically recognize objects while the sam ple is being scanned. The processed information contained in the signals and the location coordinates of objects are stored. The methods include automatical revisiting of recognized ob jects for further analysis.
