# Denture cleansing compositions.

## Abstract
The present invention provides particulate denture cleans ing compositions generally in tablet form containing a peroxy gen compound and an effervescence generator, together with sufficient acid or alkali generally to obtain a pH of pH2 to pH12. The peroxygen compound comprises an hydrated magnesium salt of a substituted peroxygen compound having the empirical anhydrous formula The effervescence generator is often a solid organic acid such as succinic acid together with sodium carbonate or bicar bonate and or anhydrous sodium perborate. At higher pHs, the composition preferably contains a complexing agent like sodium citrate in order to ameliorate a detectable impairment in the rate of dissolution of the tablet.
