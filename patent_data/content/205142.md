# PIN LIFT PLASMA PROCESSING

## Abstract
A wafer is supported on pins within a plasma reactor, allowing the plasma to act on both sides of the water. Various processes are disclosed for pins up and pins down condition. If conductive pins are used, they are preferably flattened. The water is preferably biased negatively with respect to the plasma.
