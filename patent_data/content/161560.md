# Gas cooled inlet manifold for a radial turbine.

## Abstract
A toroidally shaped double walled gas cooled inlet mani fold 12 for a radial in flow turbine 22 has a plurality of can type combustors 18 mounted on one axially facing side of the torous, arrays 82 of coolant gas inlet holes 84 in the outer wall located midway between the individual combustors, coo lant gas inlet slots 86 distributed circumferentially along the torous on the axial face mounting the combustors, and coolant gas inlet impingement orifices 88 proximate the annular mani fold exit duct on both axial facing sides of the outer wall. Annu lar coolant gas exit ports 92 are provided surrounding the cir cular combustion gas inlet ducts from the individual combus tors to induce a blanketing flow of coolant gas over the entire inner wall.
