# A method for producing lining panels which can be removably attached to a surface.

## Abstract
A method of producing large area lining panels 1 composed of thermoplastic material which are used as removable linings for containers. On the rear of the lining panels 1 there are arranged next to each other in rows a plurality of affixing knobs 2 also made of thermoplastic material which have a circular or polygonal cross section with conically inclined surface portions. A plurality of the affixing knobs 2 are simultaneously palced on the lining panel 1 and joined to it by ultrasonic, vibratory or rotational welding. The placing and welding of the affixing knobs 2 singly or in groups at a predetermined distance from each other is effected in a continuous succession.
