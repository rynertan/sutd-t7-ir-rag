# Cutter extension cone.

## Abstract
An extension cone 30 for a cutter for a hydraulic dredge. The cone has spiral helical blades 33 with an opposing helix to the cutter head 20 to force the material forward as the cutter rotates, thus smoothing the bottom and returning any material which was cut and has passed the cutter head back to the suction orifice.
