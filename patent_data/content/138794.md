# A method for recovering metal values from materials containing copper and or precious metals.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an improvement in a method for recovering metal values from copper containing and or pre cious metal containing materials which also contain anti mony and or bismuth in such high quantities as to render working up of the materials with conventional metallurgical processes difficult or impossible. in accordance with the im provement, the material is subjected to a chlorination vola tilization process in a manner to bring the antimony and or bismuth content of the material to a predetermined low level acceptable for the continued working up of the material in conventional process stages, while maintaining the metal values of the material in a substantially unaffected form. The volatilization process is best carried out at temperatures of between 450 C and 750 C, preferably between 550 C and 650 C. The chlorination process can be carried out on mat erials included in the group sulphidic or oxidic ore con centrates, matte, speiss, oxidic and metallic intermediate products. in certain cases it is convenient to convert the mat erial to another form within the group, for example the matte, prior to carrying out the chlorination process.
