## Description
Title of the Invention ZIRCONIUM BASE ALLOY STRUCTURAL MEMBER AND PROCESS FOR ITS PREPARATION The present invention relates to a zirconium base alloy structural member and process for its preparation, particularly to a zirconium base alloy structural member which is suitable especially for use in water at a high temperature and a high pressure, such as in a nuclear reactor, and a process for its preparation. Zirconium base alloys alloys based on zirconium have been used to produce structural members for a nuclear reactor, for example, structural members of a nuclear fuel assembly, such as fuel covering tube, channel box, spacer or water rod, because they have a good corrosion resistance and a small neutron absorption cross section. Known zirconium base alloys suitable for use includeZircalloy 2 Sn about 1.5 by weight, Fe about 0.15 Cr about 0.1 , Ni about 0.05 Zr the balance Zircalloy 4 Sn about 1.5 , Fe about 0.2 ,. Cr about 0.1 , Zr the balance and a zirconium 2.5 niobium alloy Nb 2.5 , Zr the balance . Zirconium alloys have a good corrosion resistance.However, when exposed to water at high temperature and high pressure in a nuclear reactor for a long time, they tend to locally form papulous corrosions hereinafter referred to as nodular corrosion by oxidation, so that the thickness of normal parts decreases to cause the lowering of strength.Furthermore, if nodular corrosions penetrate the entire thickness of a fuel covering tube, radioactive materials in the tube will leak into reactor water. Accordingly, it is necessary to improve the corrosion resistance of a zirconiumbase alloy to enhance combustion efficiency of nuclear fuels and lengthen the operating cycle. It is well known to improve the corrosion resistance ofZircalloy 2 or 4 by a heat treatment which is called Bquench . United States Patent 4,238,251 . According to this method, a zirconium base alloy is heated to a temperature range within which the B phase begins to be formed above about 840 C and rapidly cooled with water or a gas to redistribute deposits Zr Cr,Fe 2 and Zr2 Ni ,Cr or Zr2 N11 Fe 1 on the grain boundary of particles selectively. However, a zirconium base alloy having such a metallic, configuration has a remarkably low ductility, so that it tends to crack in a strong processing after B quench. On the other hand, if this alloy is subjected to hot processing or annealing to enable a strong processing, the highly corrosion resistant metallic configuration will change, resulting in the lowering of corrosion resistance. In contrast, zirconium 2.5 niobium alloy is a deposition set alloy having a good ductility, an excellent corrosion resistance and a high strength, but the welded area of this alloy exhibits a low corrosion resistance which can not be improved by the ss quench method. As described above, up to this time, it has been difficult to produce a zirconium base alloy structural member which is excellent in both ductility and corrosion resistance. The invention aims at least partly to overcome this difficulty. The invention is set out in the claims. By the present invention it is possible to provide a zirconium base alloy structural member which does not form or has a reduced tendency to form nodular corrosions when used in water or steam at a high temperature and a high pressure for a long time and have a sufficient ductility. It is also possible by the present invention to provide a zirconium base alloy structural member which suffers less oxidation. preparation. The growth mechanism of a zirconium alloy oxide layer on the surface of a zirconium base alloy is shown schematically in Figure 1. This oxide layer consists of a metal excessive oygen difficient n type semiconductor and its composition is ZrO2 x, which deviates from a stoichiometric composition. The excess metal ions are compensated by equivalent electrons to keep the oxide layer electrically neutral, and the oxygen deficient parts are present in the oxide layer as anion defects. External oxygen ions are diffused into the inside of the alloy by occupying the positions of the anion defects and bonded to zirconium on the interface between the oxide layer and the metal, so that oxidation proceeds toward the inside.The growth rate of the oxide layer is determined by the diffusion rate of oxygen, and the diffusion rate of oxygen is proportional to the number and mobility of anion defects in the oxide layer. Accordingly, reduction in the number of anion defects is thought to be effective in depressing the oxidation and enhancing the corrosion resistance. On the basis of the consideration described above, the inventors of the present invention have found that when elements which can produce a cation of a valence of at least 5 are added to the lattice positions of Zr in the oxide layer of a zirconium base alloy, the elements act as electron donors to decrease the number of anion defects, thus enhancing the corrosion resistance. That is to say, it has been found that the addition of an element of GroupV or VI is effective on the surface or the surface layer of zirconium base alloy. The elements of Group V or VI form oxides of M205 or Mj type where M is an element as described above . From the standpoint of enhancing the corrosion resistance, it is effective to add these elements as alloy forming elements into a molten zirconium base alloy. However, since these elements have a larger neutron absorption cross section than zirconium, they will affect adversely the reactivity of a nuclear reactor. Thus, according to the present invention, these elements should be distributed only on the surface or only in the surface layer of a zirconium base alloy structural member. According to the present invention, the element may be present on the surface of a zirconium base alloy by coating the surface with the element or may be contained in the surface layer by alloying the surface layer with the element.Additionally, they may be contained in the surface oxide layer. The zirconium base alloy structural member according to the present invention can be produced by the following procedures A zirconium alloy is subjected to the final plastic working and its surface is coated with an element described above, optionally followed by heating the coated product or by subjecting the coated product to autoclaving. Examples of elements of Group V include phosphorus, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, arsenic, antimony and bismuth, which those of Group VI include sulfur, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, seleni . tellurium and polonium. In the present invention, the element added can be one or more elements of above examples of elements of Group V or VI. The surface of a zirconium base alloy structural member, such as a fuel covering tube or spacer, can be coated not only by vacuum metallizing or CVD Chemical Vapor Deposition method, but also by other suitable coating methods. For example, in the CVD method which comprises mixing WCQE withH2 and depositing tungsten on the surface in an oven by the reaction WC 6 3H2 g W 6HCQ a glow discharge may be applied using a chamber as a cathode and a zirconium base alloy structural member as an anode to accelerate the above reaction. Furthermore, the ions of elements may be distributed in the surface layer of a zirconium base alloy structural member by ion implantation wherein the ions are accelerated and implanted into the member. The zirconium base alloy structural member of the present invention is used for a nuclear reactor, for example, structural members of a nuclear fuel assembly, such as fuel covering tube, channel box, spacer or water rod. The zirconium base alloy suitable for use as such a member may be selected from a group consisting of Zircalloy 2, ZircallG 4 and zirconium 2.5 niobium. There can be ebtained by the invention a zirconium base alloy structural member exhibiting a high corrosion resistance even in water or steam at a high temperature and a high pressure and having a high ductility. The structural member is used as a structural member for a nuclear fuel assembly, and it can exhibit a long life in the reactor and enhance the combustion efficiency of the fuel. The structural mainer of the invention can be plastically worked as usual without affecting the elongation adversely, because it does not contain any corrosion resistance enhancing elements at the plastic working step. The structural member of the invention has also an advantage in that it is used as a structural member in a nuclear reactor, the neutron absorption power of the member doeE not substantially increase, because it contains the elements only on the surface or in the surface layer. Examples of the invention are given below, with reference to the drawings, in which Figure 1 is a figure illustrating the growth mechanism of the surface oxide film of a zirconium base alloy. Figure 2 is a flow chart of a production process of a fuel covering tube according to the present invention. Figure 3 is a flow chart of production process of a fuel spacer according to the present invention.Example 1 A tungsten a metal of Group VI film of a thickness of 0.1 to 0.01 Vm was formed on part of the outer surface of a fuel covering tube made of Zircalloy 2 by vacuum metallizing, The resulting fuel covering tube was heated by raising its temperature for one hour, maintained at 6000c for 2 hours and cooled by decreasing its temperature for 40 minutes. The obtained fuel covering tube was kept for 24 hours in steam at 5000C and 105 kgf cm2 generally, this condition is said to be the best simulated corrosion condition in a nuclear reactor . The external appearance of the tube was observed. Outside surface metallized with tungsten was covered with a black uniform oxide film, while the other part of the outside surface, which was not metallized with tungsten, was covered with a white papulous oxide film this was produced by joining papulous nodular corrosions owing to the progress of the corrosions and looked white as a whole.The black uniform oxide film formed on the outer surface was a ZrO2 film containing tungsten distributed in the ion lattice tf ZrO2. The fuel covering tube was subjected to vacuum metal.i sing followed by heating so that tungsten penetrated into the tube, and thus the surface layer of Zircalloy 2 was alloyed with the tungsten. The corrosion resistance and ductility of the fuel covering tube made of Zircalloy 2 is definitely enhanced by vacuum metallizing with tungsten followed by heating.Example 2 In Example 2, a fuel covering tube made of Zircalloy 2 was vacuum metallized with tungsten without any heat treatment. And it was examined for corrosion resistance by keeping it for 24 hours in steam at a temperature and pressure similar to those of Example 1. On the part which had been vacuum metallized with tungstenS a black uniform oxide film was formed, but no nodular corrosion was observed. The fuel covering tube made of Zircalloy 2 which was vacuum metallized had a good corrosion resistance and good ductility.Example 3 A fuel covering tube made of Zircalloy 2 was vacuum metallized with tungsten as described in Example 1 and subjected to autoclaving by keeping it for 17 hours in steam 3850 and 1.7 kgf cm2 to form a black uniform oxide layer of a thickness of about t Vm on the surface of the tube.This layer was a strong oxide film consisting of tungstencontaining zirconium oxide. The obtained sample was examined for corrosion resistance according to the same procedure as described in Example 1. The sample had a good corrosion resistance and a good ductility.Example 4 A fuel covering tube made of Zircalloy 2 was produced according to the process shown in Figure 2. An arc molten ingot was forged at a temperature of 1000 to 1050at into a column and the column was subjected to a solid solution treatment by rapidly cooling with water and hot forged at 750 to 8000C into a longer and slenderer column. The obtained column was excavated and machined to form a cylinder having a desired size. The cylinder was extruded at 700 to 8000C to form a tube having an external radius of 63.5 mm and a thickness of 10 mm hereinafter referred to as hot extruded crude tube . The hot extruded crude tube was worked by repeating the procedure comprising annealing at 550 to 7500C and coldrolling by a pilger mill having a reduction ratio of sectional area of about 70 three times to form a tube having an external radius of 12.5 mm and a thickness of 0.9 mm hereinafter, referred to as final cold rolled tube . The final cold rolled tubes were treated according to two procedures. In the first case, a final cold rolled tube was annealed at 5770c for 2 hours, washed with a mixture consisting of hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid and water, neutralized and washed with water. The surface of the tube was vacuum metallized with tungsten. On the other hand, in the second case, a final coldrolled tube was washed with a mixture of hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid and water, neutralized and washed with water as in the first case. The surface of the obtained tube was vacuum metallized with tungsten and the tube was annealed at 5770C for 2 hours. In the final step of both cases, the tubes were subjected to autoclaving according to the same procedure as described in Example 3 to form an oxide film on the surface of the tubes. The obtained tubes were examined for corrosion resistance according to the same procedure as described inExample 1. It was confirmed that the tubes treated according to either of the first and the second cases have an improved corrosion resistance.Example 5 A spacer made of Zircalloy 4 for a nuclear fuel assembly comprises spacer bands, lattice spacer bars, spacer dividers and spacer spring. Each lattice point was welded by resistance welding. The spacer described was produced according to the process shown in Figure 3. An arc molten ingot of Zircalloy4 was rectangularly hot forged, subjected to a solid solution treatment and hot rolled to form a plate of a thickness of 2.0 mm. This plate was worked by repeating the procedure comprising cold rolling and annealing twice to form a plate of a thickness of 0.78 mm. The temperature of the annealing after the first cold rolling was from 650 to 7504Cç while that of the second annealing was 5770C. This plate was cut to produce spacer bands and spacer bars. The spacer bands were press molded to form a plate having unevenesses. The resulting spacer bands and spacer bars were set up and resistance welded to form an intermediate product having a configuration of a spacer. The surface of the intermediate product was coated with tungsten in an oven of 6000C by CVD method. The reactant gas used in this method comprised WCQ6 and H2. The thickness of the tungsten film formed on the surface was below 0,1 vm. The obtained spacer was examined for corrosion resistance according to the same procedure as described in Example 1. The surface of the spacer was covered with a black uniform oxide layer and no nodular corrosions were observed. The spacer had a good corrosion resistance and a good ductility. The above Examples illustrate the cases where tungsten was added, but the present invention is not limited to the cases. The corrosion resistance and ductility enhancing effect similar to the Examples can be obtained by adding one or more of elements of Group V or VI to surface or surface layer i.e., by aistributing or coating the surface with the elements, by alloying the surface layer with the elements , or by allowing the elements to be contained in the surface oxide layer.Comparative Example A fuel covering tube was produced according to the same procedure shown in Figure 2, except that a procedure consisting of cold rolling along with ss quench consisting of heating at 10000C for 5 seconds and cooling with water and annealing was repeated instead of the annealing after hot extruding,The surface was not coated.
