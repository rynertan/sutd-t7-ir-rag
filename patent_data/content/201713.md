# Method of making a FET gate by angled evaporation.

## Abstract
An oxide pedestal 22A is formed for use in a self aligning gate FET. The pedestal 22A is then used for a shadowing effect when performing ion implantation, and is used as a pedestal when performing an angled evaporation of metal. This results in a FET device wherein the gate length Lg is easy to control to provide a small gate. In addition, the metals used result in low gate resistance.

## Description
METHOD OF MAKING A FET GATE BY ANGLED EVAPORATION Background of the Invention This invention relates, in general, to field effect transistors. FET , and more particularly, tooa method for making a gate for a field effect transistor by using angled evaporation. Manufacture of a metal semiconductor field effect transistor MESFET consists of forming a drain, a source, and a gate on the surface of a semiconductor substrate. Metallic ohmic contacts are generally used for the drain and source electrodes whereas a rectifyingSchottky barrier metal system is used for the gate electrode. A gallium arsenide GaAs MESFET would have a semi insulating substrate. In manufacturing MESFET8 it is desirable to have short gate lengths and low electrical resistance along the width of the gate electrode. Furthermore, it is desirable that the gate structure be compatible with self aligning techniques to reduce the use of photomasks. One technique that has come into use to help accomplish this is the use of angled evaporation sometimes called shadow deposition.Most of these techniques consist of providing an opening in a photoresist material and then using the walls of the opening to provide the shadow effect. Using photoresist as a material to provide the shadow effect is not too satisfactory since photoresist does not always provide a smooth surface and smooth edges along the opening. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved method of using angled evaporation. Another object of the present invention is to provide a FET device having low gate resistance fabricated using a self aligning technique. Yet a further object of the present invention is to provide a method for fabrication of a sub micron gate for a FET without using optical lithography. An additional object of the present invention is to provide a method for angled implanting the source and drain areas of a MESFET to achieve reduced source resistance. Yet a further additional object of the present invention is to provide a method for fabrication of a low noise gallium arsenide FET having a reduced gate resistance. Summary of the Invention The above and other objects and advantages of the present invention are provided by a method of fabricating a self aligned gate FET. The method comprises establishing an oxide pedestal to provide a shadow effect and then using angle implantation to form implanted source and drain regions and using angled evaporation techniques to provide the metal gate. The subject matter which is regarded as the invention is set forth in the appended claims. The invention itself, however, together with further objects and advantages thereof, may be better understood by referring to the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Brief Description of the Drawings FIGS. 1 9 illustrate in outline form the procedure followed in providing an oxide pedestal, angled implantation, and angled evaporation and FIG. 10 illustrates the gate length as a function of the angle. The exemplification set out herein illustrates the preferred embodiment of the invention in one form thereof, and such exemplification is not to be construed as limiting in any manner. Detailed Description of the Drawings In a field effect transistor having a self aligned gate, the gate is formed first and used as a mask to implant the source and the drain. However, high temperatures are needed during annealing to activate the implant. This usually requires that the gate be made from a refractory metal so that it will withstand the high annealing temperature. The high refractory metal results in a gate having a high resistance which results in a poor performing transistor. The invention described hereinafter overcomes these disadvantages. FIGS. 1 9 illustrate an improved method for fabricating a self aligned gate MESFET. The improved method is illustrated in sufficient detail for a complete understanding of the invention however, all the steps, which are well known to those of skill in the art, needed to complete a finished product have been omitted. Illustrated in FIG. 1 is a substrate on which the MESFET will be formed. In a preferred embodiment, substrate 20 is a semi insulating gallium arsenide material. An N channel implant is then performed to obtain channel 21 illustrated in FIG. 2. FIG. 3 illustrates a layer of oxide 22 which is deposited over substrate 20 also covering N channel 21. A layer of photoresist is then placed over oxide layer 22 and exposed to leave a predefined pattern of photoresist 23, shown in FIG.4. Oxide layer 22, in a preferred embodiment, is silicon oxide deposited by plasma CVD.However, it will be understood that layer 22 could be any suitable gate support material such as silicon nitride or the like. By using patterned photoresist 23 as a mask, oxide layer 22 is removed leaving a pedestal 22A illustrated in FIG. 5. Pedestal 22A will serve as a gate support as will become more apparent hereinafter.In order to obtain a lower source resistance, an N angle implant and annealing is then performed. The low source resistance is desired in low noise FETS. The N angle implant results in the formation of source region 25 and drain region 26 in substrate 20 as illustrated inFIG. 6. Note that a portion of N channel 21 is left under pedestal or gate support 22A and joins regions 25 and 26. At this point an angled evaporation is performed to deposit a metal layer 27 which covers substantially all of regions 25 and 26 as well as N channel 21 and pedestal 22A as shown in FIG. 7. Those areas not covered by the angled evaporation of metal are covered by or else shadowed by gate support 22A. The angled evaporation results in a void of metal on one side of pedestal 22A and a thick deposit of metal on the opposite side of pedestal 22A. It will be noted that in a preferred embodiment of this invention metal layer 27 is evaporated in two steps. The first step consists of a thin layer of titanium Ti , and the second step consists of angled evaporation of a layer of gold Au .The thin layer of titanium is needed to provide aSchottky barrier for the MESFET device and the gold then provides for a low resistance gate. These two metals result in gate metal layer 27. Gate 27A is then better defined after a reactive ion etch or plasma etch of metal layer 27. The resulting gate 27A is shown in FIG.8. Note that gate support 22A is left in place, in a preferred embodiment, since gate 27A is typically very thin and is better maintained in an erect configuration by the support of pedestal 22A. Source metal 28 along with drain metal 29 are then formed to provide ohmic contacts for the MESFET device as shown in FIG. 9. The use of silicon oxide to provide pedestal 22A has resulted in devices having extremely well defined gates wherein the edges of the gate metal are very straight. This is because silicon oxide can be deposited with good uniformity and thickness. This is a great advantage over those fabrication processes which use photoresist to define an opening and to provide a shadowing effect. This is because silicon oxide can be controlled closer and better than photoresist. FIG. 10 illustrates in schematic form the required evaporation angle to obtain the desired gate length.Illustrated in FIG. 10 is a substrate 20 having a pedestal or support 22A on which a layer of metal 27 has been formed through angled evaporation. The direction of the evaporation is illustrated by arrow 31 which is at an angle , shown by arrow 32 from a vertical plane perpendicular to substrate 20. The gate length Lg is equal to the deposition thickness times sin . The angle , of course, is the evaporation angle and the deposition thickness is achieved in the standard manner. By now it should be appreciated that there has been provided an improved method of fabricating a MESFET device using angled evaporation. One of the advantages is that the length of the gate can be controlled to obtain a small gate. Another advantage is the low gate resistance which is achieved while maintaining low source resistance. Note in FIG. 9 that gate 27A is very close to source region 25 thereby resulting in low bulk resistance between the gate and the source. Pedestal or gate support 22A could be removed if so desired.
