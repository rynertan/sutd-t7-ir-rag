## Description
APERTURE IMAGINE ELECTRON GUN BACKGROJND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to an improvement in electron guns for generating electron beams for use in electron beam apparatus such as a scanning electron microscope or an electron beam lithographic machine and is 1particularly directed to the formation of an aperture imaging electron gun as distinguished from a crossover imaging electron gun. This invention is particularly important where the electron gun has a cathode of rare earth boride, such as lanthanum hexaboride LaB6 , as the material for the electron emission source. To illustrate the prior art crossover imaging electron gun, reference is made to Figure 1 showing the prior art gun 10 having a LaR6 emitter 12, an apertured Wehnelt electrode 14 also called a grid cap or control electrode , and an apertured anode 16. When the emitter 12 is heated electrically from a suitable power supply, a crossover point or source 20 in an electron beam 22 is formed between the Wehnelt electrode 14 and the anode 16 and the beam 22 diverges from the crossover point 20 through the aperture in the anode and illuminates a plate 24 having a beam limiting or skimming aperture 26. That portion of the beam exiting from the beam forming aperture is then controlled by a series of electron lenses downstream of the electron gun in a typical electron beam column. In the prior art electron gun, the beam forming or shaping aperture downstream of the gun is conventionally larger then the diameter of the crossover which is a function of cathode size position and electrode configuration . If the optics are DGaussian beam , then the crossover is the object that is imaged by the remainder of the beam column. If the beam forming or shaping aperture is instead the object that is imaged, then the optics are called shaped beam or Koehler mode imaging. In either type of optics, the characteristics of the crossover play an important role in the imaging process.However, it is also known that a rare earth boride cathode,such as LaB6, although highly suitable as a cathode material, is also somewhat reactive at high temperatures at which it operates and at such high temperatures in gassing and out gassing varies the electron emission characteristics resulting a change of size, and or changes in cross sectional dimension out of roundness of the crossover point 20 of the beam. Thus, it is apparent that since the crossover point is important in the prior art gun, and subsequent optics, this change in cross sectional dimension causes problems with the beam downstream in the beam column which must be dealt with.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The purpose of this invention is to control the object size formed by the electron gun independently of cathode size and position and electrode configuration.This is accomplished by placing a beam shaping aperture close to or in the anode plane and in line with the beam in the electron gun. The beam shaping aperture is then illuminated by the source crossover and becomes the object for the series of electron lenses that follow in the beam column. The diameter of this beam forming aperture is less than the diameter of the source crossover and is imaged rather than the source crossover as in the prior art guns. The uniqueness of the invention lies in the fact that the aperture is smaller than and lies as close as possible to the actual gan grossover.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 illustrates a prior art electron gun, an Figure 2 illustrates an electron gun constructed in accordance with the teachings of this invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION As mentioned above, Figure 1 illustrates a prior art gun in which the source crossover is imaged through the beam forming aperture, typically 100 to 400 microns in diameter, which is larger than the crossover point. Unfortunately, because of the nature of the rare earth boride cathodes, the source crossover size and cross sect4onal dimension and roundness varies and thus, the beam image also varies. Turning now to Figure 2, wherein those components having the same function as those of Figure 1 are given the same reference numeral, but with the suffix a, there is shown an electron gun 10a, a LaB6 emitter 12a positioned relative to the apertured Wehnelt electrode 14 with the crossover point 20 of the electron beam 22 in approximately the same position from the emitter surface as in the prior art gun 10. However, in this electron gun 10a, the beam forming aperture 26a is positioned in the plane of the anode or, in the embodiment illustrated, forms part of the anode, so that the aperture is then illuminated by the crossover.Being smaller than the crossover in diameter, typically 10 to 25 microns, only that part of the crossover 20 which emerges from the beam forming aperture 26a is imaged and becomes the object for the series of electron lenses which follow in the electron beam colmn. Thus, the object size of the beam is controlled independently of the cathode size, position and electrode configuration so that variations in cross sectional dimension of the crossover due to the instability of the emitter have been eliminated. Stated another way, in this invention, the cathode gun 10a is operated in a near critical illumination mode with the ratio of crossover diameter to aperture diameter is less than 1, whereas in the prior art gun, the ratio of crossover diameter to aperture diameter is greater than 1.This invention uses an aperture in the gun that is smaller than the crossover as an object source for succeeding imaging systems. The size of the emitter surface, the size of the aperture in the Wehnelt electrode and its distance from the emitter and the distance of the anode from theWehnelt electrode to allow the crossover to illuminate the bem forming aperture are all within the skill of those in the art. iMat is claimed is
