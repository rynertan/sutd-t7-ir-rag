# ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR FOR USE IN ESTABLISHING CONNECTIONS TO A RECTANGULAR PLANAR SUBSTRATE

## Abstract
An electrical connector for use in establishing connec tions to a rectangular planarsubstrate 100 comprises a hous ing 1 with three upstanding walls 3, 4, 5 carrying terminals 7 and between which the substrate 100 is received with the substrate 100 projecting beyond the fourth side of the hous ing 1 . Movement of the substrate 100 in its plane out of the housing 1 is prevented by ribs 17 on opposed walls 3, 4 of the housing 1 engaging in slots 106 in the substrate 100 the ribs 17 and slots 106 being located such as to ensure equal loading of all of the terminals 7 carried by the housing 1 .
