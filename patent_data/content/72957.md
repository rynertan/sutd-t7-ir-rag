# IMPROVED BILIRUBIN TEST KIT AND METHOD FOR DETERMINING BILIRUBIN

## Abstract
A test kit for the determination of bilirubin in a test sample is disclosed. It comprises a reagent capable of producing a color change or other detectable response in the presence of bilirubin, and a test mat comprising finely divided silica gel. The kit is utilized by wetting the test mat with a portion of a liquid test sample suspected of containing bilirubin, contacting the wetted mat with the reagent, causing the reagent to at least partially wet the mat and observing the appearance of a color change or other detectable response.
