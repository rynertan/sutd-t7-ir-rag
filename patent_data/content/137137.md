# Low power off chip driver circuit.

## Abstract
Power dissipation in an off chip driver circuit is de creased by utilizing a selectively switched transistor T3 to discharge the base of the output pull down transistor T10 , and by using a large resistance R4 in the base current path for the first stage of the Darlington pull up transistors T7, T8 . An additional transistor T5 having a larger emitter area and coupled to a lower potential source is connected in parallel with the normal phase splitter transistor T6 to provide additional output current sinking capability, and a current mirror T4, T5 is connected to control the current through both the phase splitting transistor T6 and the additional transistor T5 to control the turn on transition of the pull down output transistor T10 .
