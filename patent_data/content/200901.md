# ISOLATED GROUND DEVICE FOR FLAT UNDERCARPET CABLE

## Abstract
An adapter is provided for making electrical connection to a flat, multiconductor isolated ground cable. The cable, containing either four or fice conductors, includes a neutral conductor, a ground conductor, an isolated ground conduc tor and at least one live conductor. The adapter includes three contacts having insulation displacement portions that are disposed in registry with and for connection to the neutral, isolated ground and a live conductor, respectively. The ground conductor of the cable is connected to a metallic base supporting the adapter. The contact for the isolated ground is disconnectably attached to the adapter from its undersurface and the insulation displacement portion for connection to the live conductor is selectively movable. A direct contact pedestal having insulation displacement con tacts may be connected to the adapter through a cable link so that an isolated ground circuit with a suitable electrical outlet may be provided.
