## Description
Title Display Assemblies This invention relates to a display assembly of the type hereinafter referred to as of the type specified, comprising at least two display panels and means to stand said panels on a support surface in an upright position to enable articles to be displayed on the panels. For example, the panels may stand directly on the support surface or have feet means to support the panels. Where the panels stand directly on a support surface, without any feet means, it is essential that the panels can be assembled side by side at an angle so that the assembly will be stable, but in either case it is desirable that the panels can be assembled side by side at varying angles as required to provide a versatile display. Display assemblies are known from, for example U.S.Patent 3,571,999 which are provided with pressure engaged releasable fastener means comprising first co operable fastener elements secured around the external faces of upright standards and second co operable fastener elements secured to the end portions of each panel, to enable the panels to be connected to the uprights. However, although such fastener means permit the panel to be assembled at varying angles to one another, it is not possible to readily change the angle whilst the panels are assembled but it is necessary to dismantle the display assembly. Further, such assemblies require the provision of separate upright standards and panels. A further disadvantage is that upon repeated assembly and disassembly of the display, the fastener means deteriorate. It is an object of the present invention to provide a new or improved display assembly. According to a first aspect of the invention, we provide a display assembly of the type specified wherein the display panels each have an edge member of part cylindrical configuration arranged to co operate with each other or with an intermediate member of at least part cylindrical external configuration, the edge members and the intermediate member, where provided, S having magnetic means to enable the panels to be releasably connected together in edge to edge relationship, at any desired angle between predetermined limits. One panel may have an edge member of magnetised material which magnetically attracts the edge member of the other panel which is of magnetic material with the intermediate member where provided, interposed between the edge members of said one and other panels. Where an intermediate member is provided, this may also comprise magnetised or magnetic material. Alternatively, each of said panels may have an edge member of magnetic material and the intermediate member comprises magnetised material, whereby said edge members and intermediate member are connected together by magnetic attraction. Further alternatively, one of said panels may have an edge member of material magnetised in one direction of polarity and the other panel an edge member of magnetised material in the opposite direction of polarity, whereby the edge member of said one panel is adapted to be connected by magnetic attraction to the edge member of said other panel, without any intermediate member. Where no intermediate member is provided, one of said edge members may comprise a part cylindrical male part and the other of said edge members a part cylindrical female part of co operating internal configuration. Where the intermediate member is provided, then the intermediate member may comprise a cylindrical tube and the edge members of each panel comprise a part cylindrical female part of co operating internal configuration. The magnetised material may be provided by a strip of magnetised rubber fixed to the or each edge member and or to the intermediate member where provided or the edge member or members and or the intermediate member, where provided, may be made of magnetic material and be magnetised. The panels may each comprise a part cylindrical female part on one edge and a part cylindrical male part on the opposite edge, whereby further similar panels may be connected to said at least two panels by magnetic means. Alternatively, the two opposite edges may each comprise a part cylindrical female part which may each engage an intermediate member of at least part cylindrical configuration to enable further similar panels to be connected to said two panels. Said edge members may conveniently comprise plastic or aluminium extrusions, and one of said edge members may have a ferrous metal tube attached thereto, to provide said male part. The invention will now be described in more detail by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein FIGURE 1 is a diagrammatic plan view of a display assembly embodying the invention FIGURE 2 is a cross sectional view showing the connection between two panels of the assembly of Figure 1 to an enlarged scale FIGURE 3 is a fragmentary perspective view to an enlarged scale of one of the panels of the assembly shown in Figure 1 FIGURE 14 is a perspective view of a display assembly comprising a corner display. FIGURE 5 is a perspective view of a light fitting for use with the display assembly of Figure 1 or Figure 4 FIGURE 6 is a cross sectional view of an alternative embodiment of the invention Referring to the drawings, an assembly of display panels 10 is shown in Figure 1. Each display panel 10 as seen in Figures 2 and 3 comprises a body part 11 of rectangular configuration comprising an insulating and fire resistant material sheet 12, such as that sold under the Trade Name COOLAG which comprises a sandwich of insulating material between suitably treated fire resistant cardboard sheets 13. Of course, other types of panels may be provided such as a plain lightweight wood or cork panels. At opposite side edges 14, 15 first and second edge members 14 and 15 are provided. The first edge member 14 comprises a plastic or aluminium extrusion which has a pair of limbs 17 which enable the extrusion to be resiliently clipped to the side edge of the sheet 12. Adhesive, such as a double sided adhesive tape or glue is used located beneath the limbs 17 to adhere the extrusion to the sheet 12 for added strength. The extrusion has two grooves 18, a neck 19 of each groove being normally resiliently urged closed. The extrusion further comprises an arcuate support surface 20. The first edge member 14 further comprises a ferrous metal tube T of cylindrical internal and external configuration, which is preferably chromium plated and secured to the surface 20 by a plurality of self tapping screws 21. The heads 22 of the screws 21 are located on the underside of the support surface 20 of the extrusion in a recess 23 thereof. The second edge member 15 also comprises a plastic or aluminium extrusion which is fixed to the sheet 12 in the same manner as edge member 14 , i.e. by adhering resilient limbs 25 to the sheet 12. The edge member 15 presents a part cylindrical surface 26 in which a strip of magnetised rubber 28 is secured, again for example, by double sided adhesive tape, although if desired the strip 28 may be secured by screws, glue or any other means. The extrusion of the edge member 15 also has a pair of grooves 29 like grooves 18, with a neck 30 of each groove 29 being normally resiliently urged closed. The sheet 12 is covered with a decorative fabric as required, such as draylon or nylon or other fabric, as shown at 31 in Figure 2, the side edges of the fabric 31 being received in the grooves 18, 29 and being retained therein by the neck 19, 30 of each groove. The top and bottom edges 32, of the panels 10 are also provided with a plastic extrusion as shown at 33 in Figure 3 where the fabric is omitted, the extrusion 33 being identical to the extrusion of edge member 14 although no tube T is attached. The upper and lower edges of the fabric 31 are therefore received in grooves 18 in the extrusions 33. It can be seen from Figure 3 that the edge members 14 , 15 and the extrusions 33 are mitred to provide neat corners. As shown in Figure 1, two panels 10 can be connected in edge to edge relationship at any desired angle between limits which are dependant upon the configuration of the extrusions. If the circumferential angular extent of the extrusion is greater or smaller than that shown, then different limits are imposed upon the angles between adjacent panels, and on the number of panels which can be assembled together. For example, the angular extent may be 1200 and not 900 as shown. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the extrusion of edge member 15 has cut outs 35 in which a wall 36 of the extrusion of edge member 14 may be received to enable 0 the panels 10 to be assembled at up to 90 to one another. In use, a plurality of panels 10 as described hereinbefore with reference to Figures 2 and 3 are assembled together in a desired pattern, for example the T shape as shown in Figure 1, tube T of the first edge members 14 of the panels 10 being positioned in contact with magnetised strips 28 of the second edge members 15 of an adjacent panel 10 so that the adjacent edge members 14 , 15 are connected together by virtue of magnetic attraction between the magnetised rubber on the second edge members 15 and the magnetic material of the ferrous tubes T of the first members 114 . Alternatively, the panels 10 may be assembled in the configuration shown in Figure 4, where panels 10 are stacked on top of one another with the lower edge of one panel, 10a say, resting on the upper edge of a lower panel lOb as well as in edge to edge relationship with other panels lOc and lOd respectively. The tubes T of each panel 10a, lOb are connected by a spigot connection 35 as is shown in Figure 3, comprising a pair of cylindrical plugs 36, 37 of slightly smaller diameter than the internal diameter of the tubes T, the plugs 36, 37 being connected by a restricted grooved portion 38 in which an O ring 39 is received, to prevent the spigot 35 falling within the tube T of the lower panel. In use, the O ring 38 is sandwiched between the tubes of the upper and lower panels 10a, lOb. A light fitting 414 such as shown in Figure 5 may conveniently be mounted in the upper open end of a tube T by virtue of a plug 35 , similar to spigot 35, also having an O ring 39 in a groove 381. Located in the plug is a bracket 142 on which a light 43 is supported, the electric cable 146 for the light passing through the bracket 42 and then upwardly through the plug 39 and from the top of the plug 35 to a convenient electrical socket outlet not shown . As shown in Figure 4, such a light fitting may illuminate the panels 10. Further, the corner illustrated in Figure 14 utilises a further tube T which is not attached to a panel 10 by self tapping screws but is magnetically attached to the edge members 15 of the right hand panels lOc and lOd by the magnetic strip 28 of the extrusion of the right hand panel magnetically attracting the ferrous material of the tube T . Further, a long cross panel 10e is provided which is engaged with further short tubes Ts which are connected to the upper end of tube T by a further spigot 35 and with the upper end of tube T of the left hand upper panel 10 by magnetic attraction to add rigidity to the corner display and to conceal the light fitting 414. It will be appreciated that if desired, the assembly need not be made free standing by arranging adjacent panels at varying angles as in the examples described, but feet means may be provided or other supports to retain the assembly in the position wherein the panels 10 are upright. Although in the examples described hereinbefore, it is the female second edge member 15 which has been described as comprising a strip 28 of magnetised material, if desired the male first member 14 may comprise magnetised material, e.g. tube T could be made of magnetised material, and the second member 15 provided with or made of magnetic material. Still further alternatively, both the female 15 and male 14 members could be made of magnetised material but with opposite directions of polarity. In a still further embodiment, which is illustrated in Figure 6, both the edge members of each panel are of the same female configuration and construction as the second edge member 15 described with reference toFigures 2 and 3, and in this case an intermediate member comprising a ferrous metal tube 50 is provided which both the magnetised rubber strips 28 of each female member 15 magnetically attract. Again, by selection of the angular circumferential extent of the female members 15 around the male member 50, it may be arranged for two or more than two panels 10 to be connected to a single intermediate member 50. Again, if desired, instead of the female members 15 attached to the panels 10 being magnetised, they may be made of magnetic material and the intermediate member 50 be magnetised by any suitable means. In either embodiment, instead of providing the edge members 14 , 15 as plastic extrusions with a ferrous metal tube T, T attached to extension 14 , other types of magnetic attraction means may be provided which permit the panels 10 to be assembled in edge to edge relationship at varying angles between predetermined limits. For example, a tube T may be directly adhered to one edge of the panel 10, and magnetised material provided on the opposite edge. The present invention provides an economical and convenient means whereby a desired array of display panels may be assembled together. The invention has the advantage that the assembly and disassembly of the display panels is simple, it merely being necessary to place the edge members in desired juxtaposition or in desired juxtaposition with an intermediate member where one is provided, and the display panels are automatically connected together by the magnetic forces arising.Further, the orientation of the adjacent panels may be varied as desired whilst assembled, to provide a wide range of configurations. Separate uprights and panels are thus not required to achieve a stable versatile display assembly. Shelves and the like may be attached to the panels 10 by brackets which engage above the upper edges 32 of the panels 10, or by brackets which engage the tubes T, as required.
