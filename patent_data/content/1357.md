# Exsanguinating device.

## Abstract
The device for displacing blood from a limb by compression comprises a fluid filled envelope in the form of a double walled tube 1 of elastomer with the inner and outer walls of the same unstressed dimensions. The limb is inserted in the tube at one end 5 and the device is rolled onto the limb with the inner and outer walls exchanging positions. The internal surface of the envelope is preferably lubricated to prevent sticking where the inner wall folds at the ends 5 .
