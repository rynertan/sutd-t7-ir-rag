# High pressure hose with blow out guard.

## Abstract
A blowout guard is disclosed for use with high pressure conduits. A double layer, wire sheath is fixedly attached over the end portion of the hose. If the hose should burst, the medium escapes through the interstices of the sheath and is thereby reduced to a dispersed effluent or a fine spray, thus protecting the operator.
