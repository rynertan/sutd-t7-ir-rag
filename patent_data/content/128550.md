# single ended metal halide discharge lamp with minimal color separation and method of fabrication.

## Abstract
A single ended metal halide discharge lamp includes a plurality of fill gases selected to provide essentially white light at a plurality of distances from a pair of spaced electrodes and to combine the radiation from the multiple distances to provide white light with minimal color separation from the discharge lamp. Also, a method for providing spectral uniformity from a discharge lamp is provided wherein the emitted color and dis tance from a longitudinal axis provided by a plurality of fill gases is observed, fill gases are selected to provide white light emission at a plurality of distances from the longitudinal axis and the selected fill gases are combined to provide white light with minimal color separation from the discharge lamp.
