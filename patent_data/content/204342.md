## Description
The present invention relates to novel alkaline proteases, particularly novel alkaline proteases which have excellent stability and contribute to improving washing ability when blended in general detergents, novel microorganisms which belong to the genus Bacillus and have an ability of producing the above proteases, a process for the preparation of the above alkaline proteases which is characterized by cultivating the above microorganisms and recovering the alkaline proteases from the culture, and detergents comprising at least one of the above alkaline proteases. Recently, attempts have been made to increase the washing ability of detergents, particularly of heavy duty liquid detergents, by making the pH of concentrated detergents more alkaline and blending in various hydrolytic enzymes such as proteases, amylases, lipases and cellulases. Among these enzymes, proteolytic enzyme, particularly alkaline protease, decomposes protein stains which are difficult to wash out only by a detergent, and contributes to improving washing ability. To this end, it is essential to add such an enzyme to a detergent. Generally, alkaline protease which is produced by Bacillus licheniformis, such as those available under the trade name Alcalase hereinafter referred to as Enzyme A , Novo Industri A S, and the trade name Maxatase, Gist Brocades N.V., are often used. These enzymes have an optimal pH for activity of from 10 to 11, and therefore it is expected that they will exhibit their performance under a higher alkaline pH condition and contribute to the improvement of washing ability. However these enzymes immediately lose their activity in a high pH i.e. 10 to 11 solution of a detergent, and therefore are difficult to stably blend in a heavy duty liquid detergent. Accordingly, many attempts have been made to stabilize the activity of the enzymes in a heavy duty liquid detergent by, for example, the use of a particular anionic surfactant such as Î± olefin sulfonate Japanese Patent Publication examined 30646 1973 , combination of a nitrogen compound with a lower carboxylic acid salt Japanese Patent Publication unexamined 3733 1972 , combination of free calcium ion with a polyacid for suitably chelating the calcium ion Japanese Patent Publication unexamined 128904 1977 , addition of a specific alkoxyalkylamine Japanese Patent Publication unexamined 16012 1978 , addition of a specific boric acid compound Japanese Patent Publications unexamined 57209 1978 and 56204 1978 , and combination of an antioxidant with a polyol Japanese Patent Publication unexamined 27378 1980 . However, the above mentioned additives cannot sufficiently bring out the washing ability of the enzymes, though they can give to some extent a stabilization effect of the enzyme activity. Further, when a builder is blended, the enzyme activity is deteriorated and when stored at a temperature of 40 C or more, the additives can no longer easily produce a sufficient stabilizing effect on the enzyme, and further they may harm the physicochemical stability color, viscosity, smell, precipitate, etc. of the heavy duty liquid detergent, and therefore further improvement is required from the practical point of view. Another alkaline protease which is relatively stable in a high pH solution of a detergent and available under the trade name Esperase, Novo Industri A S is also known but it cannot give sufficient washing ability even when it is used in a large amount. Further, alkaline proteases produced by such microorganisms as Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus alcalophilus, Streptomyces, Aspergillus, Arthrobacter and Fusarium are also known. These proteases also have a problem in stability and washing ability as mentioned above, and therefore cannot be utilized. Under these circumstances, it has been very difficult to further improve the washing ability of heavy duty liquid detergents. The present invention provides novel alkaline proteases which have excellent stability in highly alkaline conditions in the presence of detergent constituents and contribute to improving washing ability. Further, the present invention provides novel microorganisms which produce the above proteases. The present invention also provides a process for the production of the above novel alkaline proteases by cultivating the above microorganisms. Still further, the present invention provides a detergent comprising at least one of the above novel alkaline proteases. The present inventors investigated various natural sources in search of bacteria which produce alkaline proteases which have good stability in highly alkaline conditions in the presence of detergent constituents and contribute to improving washing ability, and have found that strain Y, strain P, strain K and strain X, all of which belong to the genus Bacillus, produce alkaline proteases which have better properties than known alkaline proteases.

The deposit numbers are as follows Microbiological properties of the present strains isolated from the natural field by the present inventors will be explained below in detail. Determination of microbiological properties and classification were conducted according to the reference table of R.E. Gordon 1972 , Bergey s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, 8th edition 1974 . Media of pH 10 were prepared by adding 1 sodium carbonate. Determination of optimal ranges for growth of temperature and pH were carried out by a temperature gradient biophotorecorder.

No coagulation of milk is observed. Change in color of litmus is unknown because of alkalinity of the media. Summarizing the above properties, first the present strains are Gram positive rods which are catalase positive, are aerobic and produce heat resistant endospores. Thus, they belong to the genus Bacillus. Further, the present strains are rods having peritrichous flagella. In the course of formation of spores, the cells distend at a position around the termini. Matured spores are of a lemon shape. Fig. 4 shows electron microscopic photographs of strain Y and its spore. Fig. 5 shows electron microscopic photographs of strain P and its spore. Fig. 6 shows electron microscopic photographs of strain K and its spore. Fig. 7 shows electron microscopic photographs of strain X and its spore. The present strains are mesophile, cannot grow at a temperature below 20 Further, the present strains are alkalophile, cannot grow at a pH below 6 or above 12.5 and have an optimal growth pH of around 10.0 see Fig. 2 . The present strains have a property of producing acids from aldohexoses among monosaccharides, from disaccharides other than lactose, and from only mannitol among sugaralcohols. They do not produce gas. As known strains having similar microbiological properties to the present strains, there may be mentioned Bacillus pasteurii and Bacillus alcalophilus. The present strains are different from Bacillus pasteurii in that the former hydrolyze starch, while the latter does not, and the former do not require ammonium salts for propagation in an alkaline medium, while the latter does. Further, the present strains form endospore of lemon shape, while Bacillus pasteurii forms endospore of spherical or elliptical shape. From the above differences in the microbiological properties, the present strains are clearly distinguished from Bacillus pasteurii. Further, as the present strains seemed to belong to Bacillus alcalophilus, they were compared with Bacillus alcalophilus NCTC 4553 ATCC 27647 which is an original strain as described in Bergey s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, 8th edition. The present strains differ from NTCC 4553 strain in that the former reduce nitrates, while the latter does not, and the former do not decolorize methylene blue, while the latter does. Further, the present strains were compared in detail with Alkalophilic Bacillus sp. No. 221 ATCC 21522 , No. 58 Japanese Patent Publications examined 2792 1973 and 16435 1975 and No. D 6 Japanese Patent Publication examined 4236 1981 Horikoshi et al., The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research for microbiological properties. The present strains and Bacillus sp. No. 221, No. 58 and No. D 6 share a common property that they grow well on an alkaline medium pH 10 . However, the present strains cannot utilize nitrates or ammonium salts, while the above known strains can utilize these salts. Further, the present strains have a growth pH range of from 6 to 12, while that of No. 221 is from 7 to 11 and those of No. 58 and No. D 6 are from 7.5 to 11. Thus, the above known strains cannot grow at a pH below 7.0. Regarding temperatures for growth, the present strains have a growth temperature range of from 20 to 47 The above results are summarized in Table 1 below. Since the present strains are obviously different from the known strains Bacillus pasteurii and Bacillus alcalophilus having the similar microbiological properties thereto, it is appropriate to decide that the present strains are new strains which belong to the genus Bacillus. Thus, the inventors of this invention concluded that the present strains are new and named them Bacillus sp. Y, P, K and X, respectively. The alkaline proteases according to the present invention may be prepared by cultivating the novel microorganism of the invention, and isolated and purified by such a method as described in Fig. 8. For cultivating the present strains, it is possible to use any culture media, solid or liquid, which is usable for conventional cultivation of microorganisms and which can be utilized by the present strains. Such culture media contain an alkaline buffer as well as components necessary for the microorganisms to grow such as a carbon source, a nitrogen source, an inorganic salt, etc. and have a pH of 8 to 11. Examples of carbon sources include mannose, fructose, mannitol, maltose, cellobiose, sucrose, dextrin, starch, molasses, etc. Examples of nitrogen sources include soybean flour, soybean casein, defatted soybean flour, corn steep liquor, dried yeast, yeast extract, etc. Examples of inorganic salts include potassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, etc. Examples of alkaline buffers include sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium phosphate, sodium tetraborate, glycine, etc. If desired, there can be added other various organic or inorganic substances necessary for the growth of the microorganisms or the production of the enzymes. The media containing the above mentioned components are sterilized in a conventional manner and inoculated with the present strain. Cultivation may be conducted aerobically with shaking or under aerated agitation at 30 to 37 The novel microorganism of the present invention, Bacillus sp. Y, produces two kinds of alkaline proteases, that is, enzyme Ya and enzyme Yb. Isolation and purification of the alkaline proteases may be carried out by a method as shown in Fig. 8. That is, a microorganism culture fluid is centrifuged, for instance, at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes to obtain a supernatant. The supernatant is subjected to 70 saturated ammonium sulfate salting out. Precipitates are dissolved in a buffer solution, which is then dialysed against the same buffer. The solution is subjected to anion exchange chromatography and unabsorbed fractions are collected to obtain crude fractions of enzyme Ya. The unabsorbed fractions are again subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation, dialysis and gel filtration, and active fractions are collected. Those are further subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation and dialysis, and are filtered to obtain purified enzyme Ya. Meanwhile, the fractions absorbed in the course of the above anion exchange chromatography are eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 0.5 M NaCl in a buffer solution to obtain active fractions of enzyme Yb. Fig. 9 shows an elution pattern of anion exchange chromatography. The active fractions of enzyme Yb are again subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation and dialysed against a buffer solution. Then, the solution is subjected to affinity chromatography to collect active fractions, which are then subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation and dialysed against the buffer solution. The solution is further subjected to gel filtration and eluted by the buffer solution to collect active fractions, which are then subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation. Precipitates are dialysed against the buffer solution to obtain purified enzyme Yb. Physicochemical properties of enzyme Ya and enzyme Yb thus obtained are as follows Substrate specificities of Ya, Yb and a mixture of Ya and Yb 1 1 are shown in Table 2 in comparison with that of enzyme A. Conditions reaction temperature 35 It is clear from the above table that enzyme Ya shows strong specificity to keratin and enzyme Yb shows strong specificity to egg albumin, egg yolk and hemoglobin. A combination of both enzymes acts strongly on a wider range of substrates,compared to known enzyme A. Figs. 10 and 11 show the optimal pHs and pH ranges for stability of enzyme Ya and enzyme Yb. Used buffer solutions are as follows When optimal pH was examined, each enzyme was added to each 20 mM buffer solution containing 0.6 casein, and reacted at 35 Figs. 12 and 13 show the optimal temperatures and thermal stability of enzyme Ya and enzyme Yb. When the optimal temperature was examined, each enzyme was added to a buffer solution of pH 10.5 containing 0.6 casein as a substrate and reacted at each given temperature for 10 minutes. Relative activity at each temperature, based on activity at 35 Figs. 14 and 15 show UV absorption spectra of enzyme Ya and enzyme Yb. Each sample was dissolved in a 50 mM Tris HCl buffer solution pH 8.0 and its UV absorption spectra were measured. Absorption peaks of Ya and Yb were observed at 276 nm and 278 nm, respectively. Extinction coefficients at these wavelengths, E 1 1 Effect of metal ions on the activity of enzyme Ya and enzyme Yb was determined. Casein was used as a substrate. The results are shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Each metal ion was added in a final concentration of 1mM to a 20mM borate NaOH buffer solution pH 10.5 containing enzyme Ya or enzyme Yb final concentration, about 400 APU ml . After treatment under given conditions, the remaining activity was measured. The values are expressed in relative activity on the basis of the activity at the time of zero minute at 100 . As seen from the above table, the activity of enzyme Ya was inhibited by the addition of copper sulfate, silver nitrate, mercuric chloride, and cadmium chloride. This table shows that the activity of enzyme Yb was inhibited by the addition of copper sulfate, silver nitrate, and mercuric chloride. Generally, thermal stability of alkaline proteases produced by bacteria belonging to the genus Bacillus are increased by CaÂ² ion. Accordingly, in order to observe the effect of CaÂ² ion, about 400 APU ml final concentration of each of enzyme Ya and enzyme Yb was added to a 50 mM borate NaOH buffer solution pH 10.5 at 35 It can be seen that the thermal stability was increased by about 5 Effects of various inhibitors on enzyme Ya and enzyme Yb were determined. Enzyme Ya was added to a 50 mM Tris HCl buffer solution pH 7.2 at 800 APU ml final concentration . Each inhibitor was added and incubated at 35 As seen from this table, it is concluded that enzyme Ya and enzyme Yb contain serine in their active center, judging from the fact that, when casein is used as a substrate, they are not inhibited by EDTA, PCMB, antipain or chymostatin, but are inhibited by DFP and PMSF. Stability of enzyme Ya during storage in a heavy duty liquid detergent is shown in Fig. 16. The enzyme was stored in a heavy duty liquid detergents adjusted to various pH at 40 Stability of enzyme Yb during storage in a heavy duty liquid detergent is shown in Fig. 17. The enzyme was stored at 40 The results are shown in Fig. 17. Enzyme A was inactivated by 80 on the third day and inactivated completely on the seventh day. On the other hand, 70 of the activity of enzyme Yb remained on the third day and 50 remained on the seventh day. Thus, enzyme Yb has excellent stability in high pH heavy duty liquid detergents, compared to known alkaline protease. The test for enzyme stability in a heavy duty liquid detergent was carried out in an accelerated test condition at a higher temperature than room temperature, and therefore the results show that enzyme Ya and enzyme Yb of this invention are stable under normal condition from the practical point of view. Molecular weights of enzyme Ya and enzyme Yb were determined by gel filtration method. Gel filtration chromatography was carried out on a Toyopearl HW 55 trademark using 20 mM Tris HCl buffer 2 mM CaÂ² ion added, pH 7.2 , as eluent. The following proteins molecular weight in parentheses were used as standard proteins to draw a calibration curve egg albumin 43,000 , thermolysin 37,500 , subtilisin 27,300 , chymotrypsinogen 25,700 , myoglobin 17,200 and cytochrome C 11,700 . The calibration curve is shown in Fig. 18. In this method, molecular weights of enzyme Ya and enzyme Yb were determined as 21,000 and 40,000, respectively. Isoelectric points of enzyme Ya and enzyme Yb were determined by isoelectric focusing electrophoresis. Pharmalyte 3 10 was used as a column carrier. Patterns of isoelectric focusing electrophoresis for enzyme Ya and enzyme Yb are shown in Figs. 19 and 20, respectively. The isoelectric points of enzyme Ya and enzyme Yb were determined by this method as 10.1 and 5.1, respectively. Amino acid compositions of enzyme Ya and enzyme Yb were determined using an amino acid analyzer JLC 200A Japan Electronic Co. . Tryptophan and cystein were determined by a spectrophotometric method and a performic acid oxidation method, respectively. The compositions are shown in Table 7 in comparison with the compositions of known proteases. Enzyme Ya clearly differs from other enzymes in amino acids such as tryptophan, serine and valine. Enzyme Yb shows clear difference from other enzymes in amino acids such as tryptophan, histidine, arginine, aspartic acid, glycine and alanine. Results of elemental analysis of enzyme Ya and Yb are shown in Table 8. Various properties of enzyme Ya and enzyme Yb are summarized in Table 9 in comparison with Enzyme A and other known alkaline proteases produced by alkalophilic bacteria belonging to the genus Bacillus. Comparing enzyme Ya and enzyme Yb according to the invention with known alkaline proteases, the optimal pH is 10 to 11 for enzyme A, E 1, E 2 and API 21 and 11 to 12 for No. 221, while it is 10 to 12.5 for enzyme Ya, that is, it extends to a higher pH range. The optimal pH for enzyme Yb is 9 to 10 which is lower than those for enzyme Ya and other known alkaline proteases. The optimal temperature of enzyme Ya and enzyme Yb is around 70 The thermal stability of the present enzymes as well as enzyme A, No. 221 and API 21 is increased by about 5 to 10 Further, the molecular weight of enzyme Yb is 40,000 which is higher than those of known alkaline proteases, and its isoelectric point is as low as pI 5.1. Accordingly, Yb is clearly a different enzyme. Judging from the above, the present enzymes differ from any of known alkaline proteases. Therefore, it is quite reasonable to recognize enzyme Ya and enzyme Yb as being novel, so that they are designated alkaline proteases Ya and Yb, respectively. The novel alkaline proteases of this invention can be blended in a heavy duty liquid detergent or heavy duty detergent. Particularly, when blended in a highly alkaline detergent for clothes, the alkaline proteases of this invention give remarkable results as compared with alkaline proteases of the prior art. Suitable formulations of heavy duty liquid detergents containing the protease of this invention are as follows The heavy duty liquid detergents can be prepared by blending the above components in any manner. The pH of the heavy duty liquid detergents is 7 to 11, preferably 10 to 11. Suitable formulations of granular detergents containing the protease of this invention are as follows In the detergents of this invention, there can be used any of anionic, nonionic and amphoteric surfactants. Anionic surfactants include sodium Cââ Cââ alkylethoxysulfates, Cââ Cââ alpha olefin sulfonates, Cââ Cââ alkylsulfates, Cââ Cââ alkyl benzene sulfonates, nonionic surfactants include Cââ Cââ alkyl ethoxylates, Cââ Cââ alkylphenyl ethoxylates, Cââ Cââ alkylamine ethylene oxide addition products, and ampholytic surfactants include Cââ Cââ alkylbetaines. This invention will now be explained in detail with reference to the following non limitative examples. The screening procedure which the present inventors used for isolating the present strains from the natural field will be explained below in detail. Washing tests were conducted according to the method described in Yu kagaku Oil Chemistry , The bacteria selected by the above screening from the natural field are novel Bacillus sp. Y FERM BP 1029 , P FERM BP 1030 , K FERM BP 1031 and X FERM BP 1032 according to the invention, which belong to the genus Bacillus and have ability to produce alkaline proteases which have excellent stability in highly alkaline detergents and contribute to improvement of detergency. The places where these bacteria were collected are Chiba, Japan, for strain Y, an agricultural field in Sakahogi, Gifu, Japan, for strain P, Ito, Shizuoka, Japan, for strain K, and an agricultural field in Tama, Tokyo, Japan, for strain X. Collections were carried out in 1982 to 1983. Stability of the alkaline proteases produced by strains Y, P, K and X in a heavy duty liquid detergent pH 11 is shown in Fig. 3. Further, the above proteases produced by those bacteria were blended with a detergent and the degree of improvement of detergency was examined. The results are shown in Table 11. Washing tests were carried out according to the method described in Yu kagaku Oil Chemistry , These results show that the strains according to the invention have an advantage that they produce alkaline proteases which have excellent stability in highly alkaline conditions in the co existence of detergent constituents and which contribute to improvement of detergency. A liquid medium containing 2 soluble starch and 0.02 magnesium sulfate and a liquid medium containing 1 dried yeast and 0.1 dipotassium hydrogen phosphate were separately sterilized at 121 To 2650 ml of the supernatant thus obtained, 1250 g ammonium sulfate was added while cooling and stirring the supernatant. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation and were dissolved in 500 ml of 20 mM Tris HCl buffer pH 7.2, containing 2 mM CaÂ² ion . The solution was placed in a dialysis tube and dialysed against the same buffer overnight. Thus, crude enzyme solution A 890 ml, 6600 APU ml, specific activity 4350 APU mg protein was obtained. The above solution was applied on to a DEAE 53 cellulose column 3.2 x 40 cm equilibrated with 20mM Tris HCl buffer pH 7.2 and eluted with the same buffer. Unabsorbed active fractions were collected, which amounted to 420 ml activity, 11,300 APU ml specific activity, 11,800 APU mg protein. After the procedure up to here, the specific activity had increased about 6.2 fold with a 72 recovery. Further, 198 g of ammonium sulfate were added to the above fractions to salt out proteins. Then, the precipitates were dissolved in 300 ml of 20 mM Tris HCl buffer pH 7.2, containing 2 mM CaÂ² ion . The solution was subjected to gel filtration using Toyopearl HW 55 trademark and eluted with the same buffer. The resultant active fractions were subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation and precipitates were dissolved in 10 ml of the same buffer solution followed by dialysis. After dialysis, insoluble material was removed with a Millex filter trademark to obtain a 16.4 ml solution activity 210,000 APU ml specific activity 15,900 APU mg protein. This purification procedures are summarized in Table 12. The aforesaid crude enzyme solution A was applied on to a DEAE 53 cellulose column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris HCl buffer 2 mM CaÂ² ion added, pH 7.2 and enzyme Ya was eluted with the same buffer. Then, enzyme Yb was eluted with the linear gradient of 0 to 0.5 M sodium chloride in the same buffer and active fractions were collected, which amounted to 350 ml activity 4,200 APU ml specific activity 1350 APU mg protein. Then, these active fractions of Yb were subjected to hemoglobin agarose affinity column chromatography and eluted with 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 to collect active fractions. Recovery rate was 15 and specific activity was 7400 APU mg protein. Further, the above solution was subjected to gel filtration on Toyopearl HW 55 trademark and eluted with 20 mM Tris HCl buffer 2 mM CaÂ² ion added, pH 7.2 . The resultant active fractions were subjected to salting out with ammonium sulfate and the precipitates were dissolved in 3 ml of the same buffer and dialysed against the same one. After dialysis, a solution of 7 ml was obtained activity 94,000 APU ml specific activity 8,500 APU mg protein. The purification procedures are summarized in Table 13. Figs. 21 and 22 show elution patterns of enzyme Ya and enzyme Yb in gel filtration Toyopearl HW 55 , respectively. The eluting solution was 20mM Tris HCl buffer pH 7.2, containing 2mM CaÂ² ion . As seen from the above figures, enzyme Ya and enzyme Yb were completely purified by the aforesaid purification procedures. Fig. 23 shows an elution pattern of purified enzyme Ya in high performance liquid chromatography Waters WlSP 710B, two I 125 columns in series . An eluant was 50mM Sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 . A blend of 20 wt. sodium Cââ alkyl straight chain ratio 50 polyethoxy sulfate average addition mole number of ethylene oxide 3 , 10 wt. Cââ alkyl straight chain ratio 50 alcohol ethoxylate average addition mole number of ethylene oxide 15 , 6 wt. ethanol, 6 wt. sodium toluenesulfonate, alkaline builder 6.6 wt. glycine, 3.3 wt. NaOH and water to balance was prepared as a standard composition of a detergent. The pH of this detergent was 11. An enzyme was blended with the above detergent in an amount of 5,000 APU g casein as a substrate . A sample composed only of the above composition without an enzyme was designated as Sample 1. Samples composed of the above composition and enzyme Ya or Yb were designated as Sample 2 and Sample 3, respectively. Further, crude enzyme specific activity, 4350 APU mg protein prepared according to the above purification method containing Ya and Yb at a ratio of 2 1 was added to the above composition, which was designated as Sample 4. For comparison, enzyme A or Esperase trademark, Novo Industri A S was blended with the above composition to prepare Samples 5 and 6, respectively. For evaluating the inactivation of enzymes after long period of storage, detergency was determined for samples not only immediately after blending but also after storage at 40 Terg O Tometer US Testing Co. was used as a washing machine. 10 cloths stained with wet stain blended with protein, 3 Sebum cloths and cleaned knitted cloth amounted to 30 g were put into 0.1 detergent solution 900 ml and the cloths were washed at 120 rpm, 25 wherein, As seen from the above results, the samples containing the enzymes of this invention had significantly higher detergency than the samples containing no enzyme both immediately after formulation and after storage at 40 Sample 4 which contained the crude enzymes of this invention had slightly better detergency. Accordingly, combinational use of Ya and Yb, which have different substrate specificities, is desirable from the view points of performance and economy, though the present enzymes can be used alone. It is naturally expected that combinational use of Ya, Yb and known enzymes will further improve detergency effectively, because enzymes Ya and Yb have various physicochemical properties different from those of known enzymes. The enzymes can also be used for a heavy duty detergent alone or in combination with one or more of other known enzymes. The enzymes of this invention were blended with other detergent compositions to evaluate the degree of improvement of detergency given by the enzymes. As an alkaline builder, 6.6 wt. glycine and 3.3 wt. NaOH were added. The crude enzyme was used in an amount of 5,000 APU per g of the detergent compositions. Detergency of the compositions was determined after they were stored at 40 Table 15 demonstrates that the enzymes of this invention improve the detergency of these detergent compositions.
