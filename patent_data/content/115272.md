# Improved apparatus for forming dry laid webs.

## Abstract
An apparatus for depositing a uniform web of dry fibers on a foraminous wire moving at speeds greater than 500 feet per minute including offset suction and air deflecting means within a fiber distributor for imparting a horizontal velocity component to the deposited fibers in the direction of the moving wire, also a method for depositing a uniform web of dry fibers onto a moving foraminous wire including impart ing a horizontal velocity component to fibers deposited onto the wire in the direction of the wire by inducing a pressure gradient and baffling the air flow within a fiber distributor.
