# Fuel supply system comprising a centrifugal main fuel pump.

## Abstract
A high speed centrifugal fuel pump 34 delivers fuel to the main metering valve 12 of a fuel control 10 of a gas turbine engine 13 for feeding the engine s burners, and a boost pump 30 and positive displacement pump 32 pressurize fuel for the servo medium for actuating the various valves actuators 14 and engine geometry actuators 18 . The boost pump 30 also assures that the vapor liquid flow relationship satisfies the engine s requirements.
