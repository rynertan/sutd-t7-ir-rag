## Description
Ctrbaenems, Their Production and Use This invention relates to novel 7 oxo l azabicyclo 13,2.0 hept 2 ene 2 carboxylic acid derivatives very stable against enzymes in viyo and having potent antimicrobial and ss lactamase inhibitory activities. In the present specification, the carbapenem compound of the formula EMI1.1 is referred to as 7 oxo l azabicyclo 3.2.0 hept 2 ene 2 carboxylic acid. Recently, various 7 oxo l azabicyclo 3.2. 0 hept 2 ene 2 carboxylic acid derivatives having antimicrobial activity have been produced. For instance, U.S.P. 4,278,686 discloses 7 oxo l azabicyclo 3.2.0 hept 2 ene 2 carboxylic acids having a 1 lower alkylthio ethyl group at the 6 position. These compounds are known to have antimicrobial activity. However, a disadvantageous feature of these compounds consists in that when taken up into living organisms, they are rapidly decomposed and thereby inactivated in vivo by enzymes e.g. dehydropeptidase, which is an enzyme occurring in the kidney , so that the antimicrobial activity originally intrinsic to the compounds cannot be fully displayed. As a result of their continuous and intensive study in search of compounds which are stable in vivo against enzymes and have high antimicrobial and ss lactamase inhibitory activities, the present inventors found that compounds of the general formula EMI2.1 wherein X is a lower alkylene group which may optionally be substituted by a hydroxyl group, or a lower alkenylene group and Y is 1 a lower alkyl group, 2 a cycloalkyl group containing 3 to 8 carbonatoms, 3 a lower alkenyl group, 4 an aryl group, 5 an aralkyl group 6 a 3 to 8 membered heterocyclic group, or the partial structural formula Y SO2 X , with X and Y being combined with each other, represents a group of the formulaEMI2.2 wherein Q is an integer of 0 to 3, and m and n each is an integer of 0 to 6, provided that the sum of m and n is in the range of 2 to 6, and R is a hydrocarbon group which may optionally be substituted, or a 3 to 8 membered heterocyclic group or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, are fit for the above purpose.

Test Example 1 Several examples of the compound I as obtained in Examples were tested for MIC mcg ml by the following method. a Test method The MIC of each test compound was determined by the agar dilution method. Thus, 1.0 ml of each aqueous serial dilution of the test compound was poured into a petri dish and then 0.9 ml of Trypticase soy agar was poured into the dish followed by intimate mixing. The mixed agar plate was smeared with the suspension of a test organism about io8 CFU ml . The lowest concentration of the test compound at which the growth of the test organism was found to have been completely inhibited after 18 hours of incubation at 370C was recorded as the MIC minimal inhibitory concentra tion . b Test organisms 1 Staphylococcus aureus FDA 209P 2 Escherichia coli O 111 3 Citrobacter freundii IFO 12681 4 Klebsiella pneumoniae DT c Results The MIC minimal inhibitory concentration values for the test compounds are shown in Table 1.

A 200 ul portion of this mouse kidney homogenate and 200 ul of an aqueous solution of the test compound 1 mg ml were intimately mixed and kept at 300C. At 10 minute intervals, a 25 ul portion of the mixture was taken and added to 25 ul of ice bathcooled methanol to thereby terminate the reaction between renal enzymes and the test compound.The amount of the remaining test compound was determined by measuring the inhibitory action against ss lactamase produced by Proteus vulgaris GN4413 or Enterobacter cloacae TN1282 by the method described in Journal of Antibiotics, 34, 212 217 1981 . b Reseults The half life period of each compound tested is shown inTable 2.

The ss lactamase is incubated in 0.05 M phosphate buffer pH 7 with an appropriate dilution of compound I preparation at 300C for 10 minutes.Cephalothin When the ss lactamase produced by Enterobacter cloacae TN 1282 is used or ampicillin When the ss lactamase produced by staphylococcus aureus 1840 is used is then added in an amount sufficient to produce a final concentration of 0.1 mM, and the enzyrsatic reaction is allowed to proceed for 10 minutes. The enzyme activity is determined by the microiodometric method Journal of general Microbiology, vol. 33, page 121 1963 . Hereinafter, the inhibitor concentration required to inhibit the enzyme activity by 50 is expressed as I50. The I50 values for the ss lactamase produced byEnterobacter cloacae , and the ss lactamase produced byStaphylococcus aureus are shown in Table 3.
