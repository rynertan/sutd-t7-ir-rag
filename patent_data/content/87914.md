DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention comprises detergent compositions containing an essential three component detergent surfactant system consisting of specific alkyl sulfate, specific sulfonate and cationic detergent surfactants.This specific three component surfactant system is an extremely effective detergent. It is particularly effective on organic soils, for example, lipid, greasy and oily soils. Also, the use of such system results in an unusually low level of soil redeposition. Soil redeposition results when soil that is removed from the textiles into the wash liquor during the wash process is redeposited onto the textiles. The detergent compositions within the invention provide the desired superior performance over a broad range of wash water conditions. The wash water temperature can range from 50C. to 950C. It is preferred that the initial pH of the wash liquor i.e., the detergent composition and wash water mixture, be greater than 8 and most preferably from 9 to 11. The detergent compositions within the invention can be in any form, such as granules, liquids, tablets or pastes, but the granular compositions are preferred.The granules can range in density from .15 grams cubic centimeter to .8 grams cubic centimeter. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the detergent compositions within the invention provide the desired superior performance on organic soils because the alkyl sulfate detergent surfactant and the sulfonate detergent surfactant each form an electroneutral complex with the cationic surfactant. The mechanism of organic soil removal is believed to be based upon the surfactant adsorbing to the soil surface to reduce the soil water interfacial tension to such an extent that the mechanical action of the washing process removes soil from the textile surface. Since the complexes formed are electrically neutral and, therefore, do not repel each other, they can pack densely when they adsorb onto the soil surface. This results in a much lower soil water interfacial tension and thereby extremely effective soil removal.It should be noted that in order to obtain the desired superior performance of the present invention both the alkyl sulfate detergent surfactant and the sulfonate detergent surfactant must be present. However, experimental evidence indicates that it is essential that the molar ratio of cationic surfactant to sulfonate detergent surfactant be less than 1.5. Otherwise, the desired superior performance is not obtained. Additionally, it is preferred that there be a molar excess of the sum of the alkyl sulfate detergent surfactant and the sulfonate detergent surfactant with respect to the cationic surfactant to ensure proteinaceous and particulate soil removal and the suspension in the wash liquor of the soil removed from the textiles. Such soil suspension prevents soil redeposition. The following is a detailed description of the essential and the optional components of the detergent compositions within the invention. All percentages, parts and ratios are by weight unless otherwise indicated. THE CATIONIC SURFACTANT The cationic surfactant is an essential component of the compositions within the invention. Without the cationic surfactant, the electro neutral complex cannot be formed with the alkyl sulfate detergent surfactant and or the sulfonate detergent surfactant and, t lerefore, the desired superior performance is not obtained.Though, theoretically, essentially any cationic surfactant can be utilized to provide such benefit, nitrogan ous surfactants that are cationic or capable of existing in cationic form are the most practicable. Also, the cationic surfactants within the invention can be satur ated or unsaturated. The cationic surfactants within the invention are selected from i compounds having the general formula R2 OR3 m R4 OR3 y R5Q X wherein Q is N, P or S z is 1 if Q is S and 2 is is 0 is N or P R is selected from alkyl and alkyl benzyl groups having from 6 to 16 carbon atoms excluding the benzyl group each R is selected from Cii2CH2 , CH2 CH CH3 , CH2CH CH2OH , CH2CH2CH2 , and mixtures thereof each R4is selected from H when y is not two R4 alkyl, C14 hydroxyalkyl, benzyl groups, ring structures formed by joining the two R4 groups, and CH2CHOSCHOHCHOR6CHOHCH2OR6 wherein each R6 is H or any hexose wherein at least one R is H R5 is selected from R2 OR3 m1, s R4 OR3 1 and ring structures formed by joining any of the carbon atoms of R2 and R5 wherein the total number of carbon atoms of R2 plus R5is not more than 18, a benzene ring being treated as equivalent to 2 carbon atoms and wherein, if R4 is less than 4 carbon atoms then R2 contains from 8 to 16 carbon atoms excluding the benzyl group each y is from 0 to 3, m is from 0 to 3 and X is any compatible anion and ii compounds having the general formula EMI9.1 wherein Q, R3, 4, y m and X are as defined above n is 2 if O is S and 3 if Q is N or P each R7 is selected from an alkyl or alkyl benzyl group containing at least 1 carbon atom 7 excluding the benzyl group and said R groups can be joined to form 5 or 6 membered ring structures, and wherein the sum of the carbon atoms of l R3O mR732 is from 9 carbon m 2 atoms to 16 carbon atoms when m is 0 and from 10 carbon atoms to 18 carbon atoms when m is from 1 to 3, a benzene ring being treated as equivalent to 2 carbon atoms and a is from 0 to 3 iii aliphatic amines having the general formula Rê OR m R4 OR3 y R5N wherein Rê, R , R4, R5, m and y are as defined above and the pKa is at least 1 2 unit above the initial pH of the wash liquor iv compounds having the general formula Rê OR m R4 OR3 y 4.R5EMI10.1 wherein R2, R3, R4, R5, m, y and X are as defined above v compounds having the general formula R2 OR3 j 3m R4 OR3 y 2R5EMI10.2 wherein R2, R3 R3, R5, m and y are as defined above and the pRa is at least about 1 2 unit above the initial pH of the wash liquor and mixtures thereof. Preferred cationic surfactants are i compounds having the general formula R2 OR3 m R4 OR3 zR5Q X wherein Q is N, P or S z is 1 if Q is S and 2 if Q is N or P R2 is an alkyl or alkyl benzyl group having from 8 to 16 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain each R is selected from CH2CH2CH2 , and mixtures thereof each R4 is selected from H when is not 0, C1 4 alkyl, C1 4 hydroxyalkyl, benzyl groups, ring structures formed by joining the two R groups, and CH2CHOHCHOCHCOR CHOHCH2OH wherein R6 is H or any hexose R5 is the same as R4 or is an alkyl chain wherein the total number of carbon atoms of R2 plus R5 is not more than 18 each y is from 0 to 3, m is from 0 to 3 and X is any compatible anion and ii aliphatic amines having the formula R2 0R3 OR3 R5N wherein R2, R3, R4y, R5, m and y are the same as defined above and the pKa is at least 1 2 unit above the initial pH of the wash water iii compounds having the general formula c R2 0R3 m R4 OR3 y 2N R3R5 R3O yR4 2X wherein R2 R3 R4, R5, m, y and X are as defined above iv compounds having the general formula R2 OR3 m R4 OR3 NR3NR5 R3O R4 wherein R2, R3, R4 R5, m and y are as defined above and the pKa is at least 1 2 unit above the initial pH of the wash water and mixtures thereof. Because of their practicability, nitrogenous surfactants, which are described in i when Q is N, ii , iii and iv are the preferred cationic surfactantsIn this discussion i , ii , iii , and iv refer to the compounds in the Summary of the Invention. Especially preferred are the alkyl quaternary ammonium surfactants which are described in i , and, in particular, the mono long chain alkyl and alkoxy quaternary ammonium surfactants, which are described in i when R5is A selected from the same groups as R4.The most preferred cationic surfactants are the chloride, bromide and methylsulfate salts of C8 12 alkyltrimethyl ammonium surfactants, C8 12 alkylhydroxyethyldimethyl ammonium surfactants, C8 12 alkylmethyldihydroxyethyl ammonium surfactants, C10 14 alkoxytrimethyl ammonium surfactants, C1O 14 alkoxydihydroxyethylmethyl ammonium surfactants and C10 14 alkoxyhydroxyethyldimethyl ammonium surfactants. As an option, the salts of the cationic surfactants can be prepared by precomplexing the cationic surfactant directly with an anionic detergent surfactant within the invention rather than having such complex be formed in the wash liquor. Under cold water washing conditions, i.e., below 450C, the preferred cationic surfactants are i compounds having the general formula R2 OR3 m 2 R OR3 y zQ X yz wherein Q is N, P or S z is 1 if Q is S and 2 if Q is N or P each R2 is selected from an alkyl or alkyl benzyl group containing from 4 to 10 carbon atoms excluding the benzyl group each R3 is selected from CH2CH2 , CH2CH CH3 , CH2 CH2OH , CHZCH2CH2, and mixtures thereof and wherein the sum of the carbon atoms of R2 OR3 m 2 is from 10 carbon atoms to 16 carbon atoms when m is O and from 10 carbon atoms to 18 carbon atoms when m is from 1 to 3, a benzene ring is treated as equivalent to 2 carbon atoms each 4 is selected from H when y is not 0, C1 3 alkyl, C1 4 hydroxyalkyl, benzyl groups, ring struc tures formed by joining the two R4 groups, and CH2CHOHCIlOHCHOR6CHOHCH20R6 6. wherein R is H or any hexose wherein at least one R6 is H each y is from 0 to 3, each .m is from 0 to 3 wherein m is 1 when R is CH2CH2 and X is any compatible anion, particularly one selected from halide, hydroxide, methylsulfate and acetate anions and mixtures thereof ii compounds having the general formula EMI13.1 wherein Q, R3 , R4 , y, zn m and X are as defined above n is 2 if Q is S and 3 if Q is N or P each R is selected from an alkyl or alkyl benzyl group containing at least 1 carbon atom excluding the benzyl group and said R5 groups can be joined to form 5 or 6 membered ring structures, and wherein the sum of the carbon atoms of R30 mR5 2 is from 9 carbon atoms to 16 carbon atoms when m is O and from 10 carbon atoms to 18 carbon atoms when m is from l to 3, a benzene ring being treated as equivalent to 2 carbon atoms and a is from 0 to 3 iii aliphatic amines having the general formula 1R OR m 2 R OR3 y N 2 3 4 wherein R , R , R , m and y are as defined above and the pKa is at least 1 2 unit above the initial pH of the wash liquor iv compounds havinq the qeneral formula 1R OR 2 R4 OR3 y 4EMI14.1 wherein R2 R3 R4 m, y and X are as defined above and v compounds having the general formula 1R OR3 m2 R4 OR y 2EMI14.2 wherein R2, R3, R4, m and y are as defined above and the pKa is at least 1 2 unit above the initial pH of the wash liquor and mixtures thereof. Such cationic surfactants are preferred under cold water washing conditions because when they are utilized in combination with the alkyl sulfate detergent surfactant and the sulfonate detergent surfactant the electroneutral complex formed does not crystallize or become highly viscous. It has been observed that the electroneutral complex formed under cold water washing conditions with a cationic surfactant such as C12 trimethyl ammonium chloride results in such complex being crystalline or highly viscous and, thereby, is rendered less effective. Once again, because of their practicability, nitrogenous surfactants, which are described in i and ii when Q is N, iii , iv and v are the preferred cationic surfactants for use under cold water washing conditions. Especially preferred are the alkyl quaternary ammonium surfactants which are described in i and ii . The most preferred cationic surfactants are the chloride, bromide and methylsulfate salts of the alkyl quaternary ammonium surfactants which are described in i when each R2 is an alkyl group containing from 4 to 10 carbon atoms wherein the sum of the carbon atoms of R2 OR3 m2 is from 10 carbon atoms and to . 14 carbon atoms and preferably from 10 to 12 carbon atoms each m and y are 1 or 0, preferably 0 and each R4 is selected from methyl and hydroxyethyl.Also, most preferred are the chloride, bromide and methylsulfate salts of the alkyl quaternary ammonium surfactants which are described in ii when each R5 is selected from an alkyl group containing at least one carbon atom and ring structures formed by joining each R5 containing five or six carbon atoms wherein the sum of the carbon atoms of R3O mR5 2 is from 10 to 16 carbon atoms and preferably from 10 to 14 carbon atoms each m and y are 1 or 0, preferably 0 and each R4is selected from methyl and hydroxyethyl. It is essential that cationic surfactants derived from aliphatic amines have a pKa at least 1 2 unit above the initial pH of the wash liquor. Otherwise, the desired superior performance is not achieved. It is believed that such a pKa and pH limitation ensures that a substantial portion of such amines are protonated and, thus, exist in cationic form and, therefore, are able to complex with the alkyl sulfate detergent surfactant and sulfonate detergent surfactant. The level of cationic surfactant within the inven tion is related to the level of sulfonate detergent surfactant. The molar ratio of cationic surfactant sulfonate detergent surfactant is at most 1.5 and preferably less than 1. It is desirable to have some molar excess sulfate detergent surfactant present because it is effective at stripping fabric softeners that have been deposited on the textile surface in previous wash cycles. The sum of the equimolar levels of cationic surfactant and sulfonate detergent surfactant is preferably at least 2 , more preferably above 5 and most preferably above 10t of the total level of anionic detergent surfactant present.Such excess of anionic detergent surfactant is preferred to ensure proteinaceous and particulate soil removal and the suspension in the wash liquor of the soil removed from the textiles. The level of cationic surfactant within the invention is from 1 4 to 12 , preferably from 1 2 to 8 and most preferably from 1 2 to 68. THE ALKYL SULFATE DETERGENT SURFACTANT The alkyl sulfate detergent surfactant is an essential component of the detergent compositions within the invention. Detergent compositions without the alkyl sulfate detergent surfactant do not provide the desired superior performance. Such compositions provide poor particulate soil removal and increased soil redeposition. It is believed that the alkyl sulfate detergent surfactant, in addition to forming the electro neutral complex with the cationic surfactant, is particularly efficacious for such purposes. Furthermore, only specific alkyl sulfate detergent surfactants provide the desired superior performance. Performance is quite poor with an alkyl sulfate detergent surfactant in which the alkyl chain contains more than 15 carbon atoms in a linear portion of the chain extending from the head group and or more than four ethoxy groups. The alkyl sulfate detergent surfactants of the present invention are of the general formula RO C2H40 xSO3M wherein R is an alkyl chain having from 8 to 18 carbon atoms, saturated or unsaturated, wherein the longest linear portion of the alkyl chain extending from the head group is 15 carbon atoms or less on the average, M is a cation which makes the compound watersoluble, especially an alkali metal, ammonium or substituted ammonium cation and x is from 0 to about 4. The preferred substituted ammonium cations are the mono and diethanol ammonium cations. Preferably, the alkyl sulfate detergent surfactants are not ethoxylated. The preferred alkyl sulfate detergent surfactants are the sodium and potassium salts of 12 15 primary and C12 18 secondary alkyl sulfates. The most preferred alkyl sulfate detergent surfactants are the sodium and potassium salts of C12 15 linear and methyl branched alkyl sulfates. Under cold water wash conditions, i.e., below 450C, the preferred alkyl sulfate detergent surfactants are the secondary and shorter alkyl chain alkyl sulfate detergent surfactants within the invention. The level of alkyl sulfate detergent surfactant within the present invention is from 2 to Soe, preferably from 3 to 30 and most preferably from 5 to 20 . THE SULFONATE DETERGENT SURFACTANT A sulfonate detergent surfactant is an essential component of the compositions within the invention.Compositions without the sulfonate detergent surfactants within the invention do not give the desired superior performance. A very wide range of sulfonate detergent surfactants can be used in the compositions of the invention.However, it is believed that the alkyl chain portion of such surfactants should be saturated. For example, a olefin sulfonates, which have an unsaturated carbon bond, do not provide the desired superior performance. Suitable sulfonate detergent surfactants are Cg 15 alkyl benzene sulfonates, C8 24 paraffin sulfonates, C818 alkyl glyceryl ether sulfonates, esters of a sulfonated fatty acids containing from 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the fatty acid group and from 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the ester group and C 1 6 alkyl or aryl sulfonates containing an ether, ester or amide linkage to a C7 15 alkyl chain. The preferred sulfonate detergent surfactants are the secondary alkyl benzene sulfonates having from 9 to 15, preferably from 11 to 13 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain. Suitable paraffin sulfonates contain from 8 to 24 carbon atoms and preferably from 12 to 18 carbon atoms. The alkyl glyceryl ether sulfonates are those ethers of C8 18 alcohols, e.g., those derived from tallow and coconut oil. Suitable esters of a sulfonated fatty acids contain from 6 to 20 carbon atoms in the fatty acid group and from 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the ester group.

MISCELLANEOUS INGREDIENTS In addition to the above named ingredients, the compositions of this invention can contain all of the usual components of detergent compositions including the ingredients set forth in U.S. Patent 3,936,537,Baskerville et al.Such components include color speckles, bleaching agents, bleach activators, suds boosters, suds suppressors, antitarnish and or anticorrosion agents, soilsuspending agents, soil release agents, dyes, fillers, optical brighteners, germicides, pH adjusting agents, alkalinity sources, hydrotropes, antioxidants, enzymes, enzyme stabilizing agents, perfumes, etc. In addition to being able to function as a detergency builder, water soluble salts of fatty acids can be added as part of the surfactant system. Surprisingly, they are most effective under cold water wash conditions. Suitable water soluble salts of fatty acids have from 8 to 18 carbon atoms. The preferred water soluble salts of fatty acids are the sodium, potassium and magnesium salts of C12 14 fatty acids.They can be present at levels up to 10 . Enzymes are believed to be particularly effective in the detergent compositions of this invention. The enzyme containing detergent compositions are particularly effective on enzyme sensitive stains such as grass and blood while maintaining greasy and oily soil detergency. Suitable enzymes are, those, for example, disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,176,079, Guerry et al November 27, 1979 . The enzymes are included at a level of from .02 to 3 , preferably from .1t to 1 . Non limiting examples of bleaching agents are sodium perborate as the monohydrate or tetrahydrate , sodium percarbonate and other perhydrates, at levels from 5 to 35 by weight of the composition, and activators therefor, such as tetraacetylethylenediamine, tetraacetylglycouril and others known in the art, and stabilizers there for, such as magnesium silicate, and ethylenediaminetetraacetate. Peroxy carboxylic acids, for example, such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,091,544, Hutchins May 30, 1975 , are especially useful. Preferred optional ingredients include suds modifiers particularly those of suds suppressing types, exemplified by silicones, and silica silicone mixtures. U.S. Patents 3,933,672, issued January 20, 1976 toBartolotta et al, and 4,136,045, issued January 23, 1979 to Gault et al, disclose silicone suds controlling agents. The silicone material can be represented by alkylated polysiloxane materials such as silica aerogels and xerogels and hydrophobic silicas of various types. The silicone material can be described as siloxane having the formula EMI25.1 wherein x is from 20 to 2,000 and R and Ri are each alkyl or aryl groups, especially methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and phenyl. The polydimethylsiloxanes R and R1 are methyl having a molecular weight within the range of from 200 to 2,000,00, and higher, are all useful as suds controlling agents.Additional suitable silicone materials wherein the side chain groups R and R1 are alkyl, aryl, or mixed alkyl or aryl hydrocarbyl groups exhibit useful suds controlling properties. Examples of the like ingredients include diethyl , dipropyl , dibutyl , methyl , ethyl , phenylmethylpoly siloxanes and the like. Additional useful silicone suds controlling agents can be represented by a mixture of an alkylated siloxane, as referred to hereinbefore, and solid silica. Such mixtures are prepared by affixing the silicone to the surface of the solid silica.A preferred silicone suds controlling agent is represented by a hydrophobic silanated most preferably trimethylsilanated silica having a particle size in the range from 10 millimicrons to 20 millimicrons and 2 a specific surface area above 50 m gm. intimately admixed with dimethyl silicone fluid having a molecular weight in the range from 500 to 200,000 at a weight ratio of silicone to silanated silica of from 19 1 to 1 2. The silicone suds suppressing agent is advantageously releasably incorporated in a water soluble or water dispersible, substantially nonsurface active detergent impermeable carrier. Particularly useful suds suppressors are the selfemulsifying silicone suds suppressors, described in D.S. Patent 4,073,118, Gault et al, issued February 21, 1978. An example of such a compound is DB 544, commercially available from DowCorning, which is a siloxane glycol copolymer. Suds modifiers as described above are used at levels of up to approximately 2 , preferably from 0.1 to 1 t by weight of the surfactant. Microcrystalline waxes having a melting point in the range from 35 C 115 C and a saponification value of less than 100 represent additional examples of preferred suds control components for use in the subject compositions, and are described in detail in U.S. Patent 4,056,481, Tate, issued November 1, 1977. The microcrystalline waxes are substantially water insoluble, but are water dispersible in the presence of organic surfactants. Preferred microcrystalline waxes have a melting point from 65 C to 1000C, a molecular weight in the range from 400 1,000 and a penetration value of at least 6, measured at 770F by ASTM D1321. Suitable examples of the above waxes include microcrystalline and oxidized microcrystalline petroleum waxes Fischer Tropsch and oxidized Fischer Tropsch waxes ozokerite ceresin montan wax beeswax candelilla and carbauba wax. Alkyl phosphate esters represent an additional preferred suds control agent for use herein. These preferred phosphate esters are predominantly monostearyl phosphate which, in addition thereto, can contain diand tristearyl phosphates and monooleyl phosphate, which can contain di and trioleyl phosphate. The alkyl phosphate esters frequently contain some trialkyl phosphate. Accordingly, a preferred phosphate ester can contain, in addition to the monoalkyl ester, e.g., monostearyl phosphate, up to 50 mole percent of dialkyl phosphate and up to 5 mole percent of trialkyl phosphate. Small amounts of zwitterionic and or ampholytic surfactants can be present, but because of the outstanding performance characteristics of the compositions within the present invention, surfactants additional to the essential components will not generally be necessary. The following examples are given to illustrate the parameters of and compositions within the invention.All of the compositions are stated in percent by weight. EXAMPLE I Wash water solutions were prepared that represented the following compositions A B CC8 alkyltrimethylammonium chloride 0 0 3.0 C12 alkyltrimethylammonium chloride 3.3 0 0Sodium C13 linear alkylbenzene sulfonate C13 LAS 4.9 5.1 4.9 Sodium C14 15 methyl branched alkyl sulfate C5AS 12.6 13.5 12.6 9 11 alkvl polyethoxylate alk 2.5T 91 AE2.5T 3.3 3.4 3.3Sodium carbonate 24.6 25.4 24.7Sodium tripolyphosphate 28.1 29.1 28.2Sodium nitrilotriacetate 8.6 8.9 8.6Sodium sulfate 12.3 12.7 12.3Sodium silicate 1.6 r 2.0 2.0 2.0Optical brightener .29 .30 .29 Stripped of lower ethoxylated fractions and fatty alcohol. Three sets of four 3 x3 swatches consisting of standard textiles stained with standard soils were prepared. A laundry load consisting of one set of the swatches along with six clean terry cloth towels and one terry cloth towel soiled with a mixture of particulate soil and oily soil was placed in a mini wash system.The load was then washed with a quantity of CompositionA that corresponds to detergent concentrations utilized in conventional automatic wash processes. The mini wash system with such a load simulates a conventional automatic washing process. The wash water had a temperature of 950F and contained 5 grains gallon water hardness. This wash process was repeated two more times, once with the second set of swatches and Composition B and once with the third set of swatches and Composition C. Each of the four swatch types was then comparison graded against its identical counterpart that had been washed with a different detergent composition to determine relative soil removal. A grading scale of 4 to 4 was used, with 4 indicating much less soil removal, 0 indicating no difference and 4 indicating much more soil removal. The entire above procedure, consisting of preparing three sets of four swatches and three wash cycles, was repeated four more times. Therefore, each swatch type of each detergent composition was graded a total of four times. Such four grades were then averaged. Finally, the average of such averages for each detergent composition was calculated. This average is known as theCleaning Index. The results were as follows A B CCleaning Index 0 .56 .38Least Significant Difference .05 .41 .41 .41 Compositions A and C provided significantly more soil removal than Composition B, which did not contain the essential cationic surfactant.

Thus, it appears that sodium C16 alkyl 4 sulfate cannot substitute for a sulfonate detergent surfactant within the invention. EXAMPLE III Wash water solutions were prepared that represented the following compositions A B CC13 LAS 5.3 10.6 17.6C45 AS 12.3 7 0C12 a lkyltrimethylammonium chloride 3.1 3.1 3.1 C91 AE2.5T 3.1 3.1 3.1Sodium carbonate 22.4 22.4 22.4Sodium tripolyphosphate 36.3 36.3 36.3Sodium nitrilotriacetate 5.7 5.7 5.7Sodium sulfate 9.9 9.9 9.9Sodium silicate 1.6 r 1.8 1.8 1.8Optical brightener .27 .27 .27 Six 3 x3 clean swatches of various textile types were made. The six swatches and six clean terry cloth towels were placed in a mini wash system. The load was then washed in wash water containing lipid soil and organic and inorganic particulate soil with a quantity of Composition A that corresponds to detergent concentrations utilized in conventional automatic wash processes.The textiles were then dried. The same swatches and terry cloth towels were washed in such process five more cycles. After the sixth cycle the six swatches were measured to obtain the difference in Hunter Whiteness UnitsFiltered HWU . This measurement corresponds to the amount of soil deposited onto the swatches, with the lower number signifying greater soil redeposition. The average AlIWUF grades for the six swatches, A HWUF avg., was calculated. The entire above procedure was repeated two more times, once with Compositions B and once with Composition C. The results were as follows A B C A HWUF avg. 10.5 14.0 26.5 Least Significant Difference .05 2.5 2.5 2.5 There was significantly less soil redeposition on the swatches with Compositions A and B than with Composition C. This result indicates that the alkyl sulfate detergent surfactant, which was not present in Composition C, is essential to prevent soil redeposition. Also, Composition B. had somewhat more soil redeposition than Composition A. This is due to the decreased level of alkyl sulfate detergent surfactant of Composition B.

It is believed that this is because Compositions B and C did not contain an alkyl sulfate detergent surfactant. Therefore, the alkyl sulfate detergent surfactant is also essential for soil removal.
