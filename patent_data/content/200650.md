## Description
The present invention concerns a system for measuring the strength of a sheet such as paper while the sheet is being produced. In the manufacture of sheet material such as paper it is often important to know the strength of the sheet. For example, strength of paper can be measure in various ways including burst, tensile and pierce strengths. Normally, these strength parameters are determined by various destructive tests in a laboratory. However, on line determination of paper strength during the manufacture of paper can aid in producing paper which can meet specified strength requirements. U.S. Patent 4,291,577 teaches a system for measuring the strength of paper as it is being produced. The patent provides for measurement of the velocity of ultrasonic waves through the moving paper sheet. Based upon the velocity, the strength of the paper is determined. The patent teaches a device having two wheels which are spaced apart from one another and which roll along the moving paper web. The first wheel contains a transducer in the form of a rectangular button mounted on the periphery of the wheel so that as the wheel rotates the button periodically contacts the paper. Each revolution of the wheel, when the transducer contacts the paper, it receives an electrical signal from a signal generator and imparts a mechanical signal to the paper. The second wheel contains a receiving transducer substantially the same as the transmitting transducer, which also is mounted on the periphery of the wheel and occupies a small percentage of the total circumference of the wheel. The receiving transducer contacts the paper once each revolution of the wheel and receives the signal from the transmitter by picking up the ultrasound signal from the paper and converting it to an electrical signal. The system also includes a position detector to monitor the rotational position of the first wheel and to trigger the firing of the ultrasound pulse by the transmitter when the wheel is in a predetermined position. The rotation of the receiving wheel is coordinated with the transmitting wheel so that the receiving transducer is in contact with the paper at the appropriate time to receive the transmitted signal. The signal from the receiving transducer is transmitted to a metering and recording apparatus which measures the velocity of the ultrasonic waves. The system described in the patent has a number of disadvantages. Since the transmitting transducer and the receiving transducer each contact the paper during only a small percentage of the total rotation of the wheels, the rotation of the wheels must be carefully synchronized and the transmission of the pulse must be carefully timed so that the pulse is received by the transmitter when it is in contact with the paper. Furthermore, since the transmitter and the receiver are only in contact with the paper for a small percentage of the total rotation of the wheels, a substantial portion of the paper is not subject to velocity measurement. Another system is disclosed in the document US A 3 933 035. The system disclosed in this patent comprises two driving means which respectively drive a strip at two different speeds. Tension measuring devices are respectively disposed in front of the driving means and they deliver signals which are proportional to the tensions measured. A comparator receives these signals and determines their difference which is proportional to the elastic coefficient of the strip. The main disadvantage of this system is that it cannot indicate the strength of the strip at different localized areas of this strip. An object of the present invention is to provide a system and process for continuously measuring the strength of a moving sheet. A further object is to provide such a system which utilizes the tension and elastic modulus of the sheet and also the velocity of the sheet to determine strength. To achieve these objects, the present invention provides a system for non destructively determining the strength of a sheet of material being drawn under tension to travel between a first roll and a second roll, the sheet of material having a width, the system comprising The present invention further provides a process for non destructively determining the strength of a sheet which is being drawn under tension between a first roll and a second roll comprising the steps of Further objects and advantages of the present invention can be ascertained by reference to the specification and drawings herein which are offered by way of example and not in limitation of the invention which is defined by the claims. Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of the present embodiment. Figure 2 is an illustration of part of the present embodiment. Figure 3 is a top view of the part shown in Figure 2. As an aid in understanding the invention, the paper making process is briefly described with reference to Figure 1. A more elaborate description is provided is U.S. Patent 3,757,122 issued September 4, 1973 and entitled Basis Weight Gauging Apparatus, System and Method Using A Digital Count . With reference to Figure 1, raw stock is supplied to paper machine 2 through a stock valve 3. White water from collection reservoir 4 is drained by a line 4a, mixed with raw stock and supplied through stream valve 5 and fan pump 6 to head box 7. The pulp and white water mixture jets from head box 7 through slice 8 on top of and parallel with wire 9. Water passes through wire 9 and is collected by reservoir 4. However, the majority of fiber is left behind to form a wet sheet of paper 10. After leaving wire 9, sheet 10 is passed through press 11 consisting of a plurality of rollers 12 which removes much of the water from sheet 10. Thereafter the paper sheet passes into a dryer section 14 consisting of a plurality of rollers 15 through which steam is supplied by a steam control valve 16. The steam heats the rollers and consequently evaporates much of the water in the paper sheet so that the paper emerging from dryer section 14 has the desired moisture content. The paper passes from dryer section 14 to a calendar stack 17. The calendar stack 17 includes a plurality of calendar rollers 18, 20, 22, 24, 26 and 28. The bottom most roller, 28, is larger than the other rollers and is driven by a motor 30 which is powered by electricity from line 32. Electricity from line 32 is supplied to the motor 30 through an ammeter 34 which measures the current passing through line 32. A tachometer 35 is coupled to the motor 30 to measure the speed of the motor. After leaving the calendar rolls 26 and 28, the sheet passes through scanner 36 and is wound onto reel 40. The reel 40 is driven to rotate by a pope roll 42 which in turn is rotated by motor 44. The motor 44 receives electric current through line 46 and ammeter 48. The scanner 36 is conventional and will therefore not be discussed in detail herein. Basically, the scanner 36 includes two heads, one disposed above and the other below the sheet of paper. The scanner 36 also includes a drive system to cause the scanners to reciprocate back and forth across the moving sheet of paper. Further details of a scanner can be ascertained from U.S. Patent 3,621,259 titled Sheet Gauging Apparatus . Turning to Figures 2 and 3, there is shown part of an upper gauging head 50 and part of a lower gauging head 52. Both heads 50 and 52 are coupled to the scanner 36 so that they can be moved back and forth across the moving sheet of paper. A support member 54 is coupled to the upper gauging head 50 by pivot 55. The support member includes two brackets 56 mounted at its lower end, and a U shaped bracket 58 is coupled to the brackets 56 by pivot 57. Thus it can be seen that the U shaped bracket 58 can rotate horizontally about pivot 55 and vertically about pivot 57. A wheel 60 is mounted in the U shaped bracket 57 by an axle 62 on bearings, not shown. Thus, the wheel 60 is free to rotate as indicated by the arrow and also to move upward and downward as the bracket 58 rotates about the pivot 57. The support member 54 includes an indentation 66 adjacent the upper part of U shaped bracket 58. A load cell 70 is coupled to the support member 54 in the indentation 66 and also to the bracket 58. The load cell 70 is a conventional device to measure the compressive force on the load cell and generate a signal corresponding to the compressive force. Thus it can be seen that the load cell 70 measures the upward force on the wheel 60. The load cell 70 is coupled by line 71 to transmit signals to a computing system 72 mounted In the upper gauging head 50. A tachometer 74 is coupled to the bracket 58 and to the axle 62 to measure the rate of rotation of the wheel and generate a signal corresponding thereto. The signals from the tachometer 74 are conveyed to the computing system 72 by a line 76. A support 80 is coupled to the lower gauging head 52, below the sheet 10, and a sheet support member 82 is coupled to the support 80. The sheet support member 82 is substantially toroidal in shape and has a smooth, rounded upper surface. In operation, the wheel 60 is mounted above the sheet of paper 10, and the sheet support member 82 is mounted directly below the wheel, and on the opposite side of the sheet of paper. The wheel 60 and sheet support member 82 are positioned so that the sheet 10 is in contact with the upper surface of the support member 82, and the wheel 60 pushes the paper in the center of the support member 82 downwardly a predetermined distance which in practice can be about 0.2 0.5 centimeters, and preferably about 0.4 centimeters, below the upper edge of the support member 82 for a support member 82 about 12,7 cm 5 inches in diameter. Thus increases and decreases in the tension and elastic modulus i.e. the ratio of stress to strain in the paper of the sheet 10 impart variable forces on the load cell 70. Higher sheet tension or higher elastic modulus results in higher force on the load cell 70. Also, the wheel 60 is caused to rotate as the sheet 10 moves. The computer 72 receives signals from the load cell 70 corresponding to the tension and elastic modulus in the paper and signals from the tachometer 74 corresponding to the velocity of the paper. The computing system 72 utilizes the data to determine the strength of the sheet of paper as will be discussed in more detail hereinafter. As the heads 50 and 52 scan across the sheet, the support member 54 and wheel 60 pivot slightly about pivot 55 so that the wheel 60 rolls smoothly on the sheet. The computing system 72 receives signals from the ammeter 34 which measures the load on the motor 30 driving calendar roller 28. The load on motor 30 is representative of the average tension on the sheet of paper between rollers 15 and the first calendar stack roller 18. The computing system 72 also receives signals from the ammeter 48 which indicate the load on the motor 44 which in turn is representative of the tension on the sheet 10 between the calendar roller 28 and the pope roll 42. The computing system 72 also receives signals from tachometer 35 measuring the speed of motor 30, which is representative of the speed of the sheet of paper 10 as it passes over roller 28. The computing system 72 utilizes the parameters discussed above to determine the strength of the paper according to the following equation Where Where The density ρ in this case can be determined utilizing the conventionally measured parameters of basis weight and caliper wherein density equals basis weight divided by caliper.
