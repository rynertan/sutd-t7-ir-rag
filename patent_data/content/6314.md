## Description
Elbow Replacement Brosthesis This invention relates to a Prosthesis for tctal or partial replacement of an ebio, especially arthritic or ded e elbow joints, which is relatively easy to install and which provides a relatively large range of flaxible movements. Lore particularly, it concerns a form of elbow joint prosthesis that has good joint stability with minimum bone removal while providing normal flexion and extension motion there is substantially no in built constraint and so little strain or the seating of the prosthesis. In general, prosthetic replacement of the elbow has proved a difficult and often disappointin task over the years and this has been the experience of most surgeons in this field. In the past, it was common to replace the elbow joint by means of a constrained prosthesis, usually consisting of a large stem inserted into the humerus and another into the ulna and the two parts of the component linked together by an axle pin. The strong forces on the elbo tend to disrupt the prosthesis from the bone and a very great deal of bone had to be removed to put in such a prosthesis, resulting in the long term in a disastrous situation very often if the prosthesis has, in fact, to be removed. There has been a move in recent times to a surface replacement of the elbow joint and V work in this area led to the developLient of a ocr strained device with a slot stability factor which is described in U.o. Patent Specification 4,079,469.Numerous patent specifications have issued describing bone joint prosthesis of one kind or another but none is wholly satisfactory. In spite of the numerous procedures and devices previously developed and used for elbow reconstruction, there exists a need for further improvement particularly as regards resulting joint stability, minimal removal of bone for insertion and allowance for normal flexion and extension motion as well as minimal strain on the seating of the prosthesis. According to the present invention there is provided a prosthesis for total or partial replacement of an eblow comprising a humeral component to replace the trochlea bone and to partially replace the capitulum bone of the humerus, the humeral component being adapted to be fixed to the humerus and having a concave surface in the coronal plane, the surface of the humeral component being convex in the sagittal plane at the level of the concave surface in the coronal plane, and an ulnar component adapted to be seated on and into the olecranon process of the ulnar bone, the ulnar component having a corresponding convex surface in the coronal plane to articulate with the concave surface of the humeral component in the coronal plane and a corresponding concave surface in the sagittal plane to articulate with the convex surface of the humeral component in the sagittal plane, any lateral shift of the ulnar component being discouraged in the prosthesis when in situ by the side walls of the concave convex articulation surface of the humeral component.Preferably the concave surface of the humeral component ends laterally in a convex boundary surface, the convex boundary surface being in a plane normal to the coronal plane, and generally the humeral component will be one wherein the lateral convex boundary surface is the boundary of a partcylindrical surface extending in the coronal plane,If desired, the prosthesis may include a radial component. Preferably the radial component comprises a cylindrical head having an end concave surface adapted to articulate with part of the humeral prosthesis. The humeral component or the ulnar component or each may be made partially of one material and partially of another material. The humeral component may be made at least partially of a plastics material, e.g. high density polyebiylene or it may be made at least partially of a metal or metallic alloy, e.g. an alloy containing cobalt, chromium and molybdenum. The ulnar component may be made at least partially of a metal or metallic alloy, e.g. an alloy containing cobalt, chromium and molybdenum. For instance, if desired, the ulnar component may be made partly of plastics material, on the surface s intended to articulate with the corresponding surfaces of the humeral component especially when the corresponding surface s of the humeral component is are made of metallic alloy or other metal , and partly of metal.The radial component, when present may be made at least partially of a metal or metallic material, e.g. an alloy containing cobalt, chromium and molybdenum. The invention also provides instrumentation for implantation of the prosthesis of the invention, the instrumentation comprising a humeral component impactor comprising a handle fixed to an end member having an internal curved pushing surface whose curvature corresponds to the external concave convex surface of the humeral component in the coronal plane, and an ulnar component impactor comprising a handle fixed to an end member having an external curved pushing surface whose curvature corresponds to the internal convex concave surface of the ulnar component. refersl the instrumentation includes a pair of different bone chisels, each bone chisel having a he joined to a base member of inverted U section by a stern, each limb of the U section terminating in a chisel tip, and the limbs of the U section of each bone chisel lying in planes parallel to one another, and at least one of the bone chisels having its base eber of invertedU section inclined to its stem. The instrumentation may include a rasp or the like to clear the surface of the olecranon during implantation of the prosethsis.

Referring in detail to the drawings, an elbow replacement prosthesis 2 basically comprises a humeral component 4 that is implanted in the humerus 6 and an ulnar component 8 implanted in the ulna 10.Optionally, it may comprise a radial component 12 Fig. 18 that is implanted in the radius 14. The humeral component 4 has a concave surface 16 in the coronal plane that is joined laterally to a convex boundary surface 181 limiting the part cylindrical surface 18, the latter partially replac ing the capitulum bone of the humerus upon implantation. In the sagittal plane, the surface lÏ becomes convex at 20 at the level of the concave surface in the coronal plane for articulation with the ulnar component 8. The surfaces 16, 18, 181 and 20 form articular surfaces of the humeral component 4. A slightly different form of humeral component 4 is employable in the prosthesis for replacement of a totally destroyed elbow joint see Figs. 8 and 14 .The component 4A is the same in all particulars to component 4 except that a concave articular surface 16 in the coronal plane extends right across the whole length of the component 4A and although there is a convex boundary surface 18 there is no convex surface extending in the coronal plane corresponding to convex surface 18 in component 4 Fig. 4 or to convex surface 86 in component 70 Fig. 9 . The surface for attaching the humeral component 4 to the humerus comprises a superior U slot 22 with an anterior wall 24, posterior wall 26 and flat floor 28. The walls 24 and 26 may be anterior or posterior depending on whether it is the right or left elbow in which the prosthesis is to be inserted the same prosthesis can be used for right and left. Longitudinal grooves 30 are formed in the walks 24 end 26 for keying of cement for iìltDlantation of the component 4. he lateral wall 32 has a erierzl groove 34 and the medial wall 36 a similar groove 35 for keying of cement. Annular wire rkers 4C are embedded in the walls 32 and 36 and a longitudinal wire marker 42 is embedded in the floor 28 so that position of the prosthesis can be determined byX ray inspection, after implantation, of both the coronal and sagittal planes by means ci the three markers. The main articulating surface of component 4 describes a gentle concave curve in the coronal plane which allows for simple and effective engagement with a convex surface 44 in the coronal plane of the ulnar component 8. Thus, a limited amount of sideways rotation motion is allowed which may at times become necessary in order to avoid undue strain on the bony attachments to the prosthetic components. In the sagittal plane of the component 4, the concave articulating surface 16 increases in radius from its centre in both the medial and lateral directions until it meets the boundary convex surfaces 181 and convex surface 20. The articular surface of ulnar cooent 8 comprises the convex surface 44 in the coronal plane and a concave surface 46 in the sagittal plane.These surfaces allow for accurate and easy articulation with surface 16 of the humeral component 4. The bone attaching portion of the ulnar component 8 comprises a longitudinal dove tailed keel 48 with grooves 50 running longitudinally along beside the keel 48 for keying of cement in implantation. A stem 52 depends from the keel 48 and under surface 54 of the articulating area for insertion into the ulna.The stem 52 has nipples 56 on both the medial or lateral surface 58 and surface 60 for keying into cement for implantation. Surface 60 is lateral if surface 58 is medial or surface 60 is medial if surface 58 is lateral. The length of stem 52 may be increased for special circumstances or other reasons. The ulnarcomponent 8 is adapted to fit onto and into a surgically prepared ulna. The angle which the stem 52 describes with the articulating area is selected to control anteversion seating of the component 8 in the ulnarbone 10. This is important for antero posterior stability of the reconstructed elbow joint. A reconstructed elbow joint employing a prosthesis embodying the invention may also include a radial component 12 Fig. 18 . In actual fact, although the head of the radius 14 is always removed for insertion of the prosthesis 3it. 21 , it is not always necessary to replace this removed bone. However, in necessary cases, the bone may be replaced with a radial component 12 Figs. 18 and 22 which comprises a distal key portion 62 having cement keying grooves 64 and an integral proximal bearing button 66 with dished surface 68. If the radial component 12 is used, it will in practice be implanted into the surgically prepared radius 14 and fixed in place with cement in a manner similar to implant of the ulnar component 8. In order to assess the depth of humeral bone to be removed and also for sizing of a component to fit a particular pateint, trial humeral components may be used, e.g. humeral component 70 Fig. 8 or the more usual humeral component 72 Fig. 9 . The component 70 corresponds to the component 4h fig. 14 and component 72 to the component 4 Figs. 2, 4 and 13 . The component 70 Fig. 8 comprises a concave surface 74 in the coronal plane, lateral wall 76 and medial wall 78. Component 70 has U shaped slot defined by the posterior wall 80, anterior wall S and floor 82. 2e component 72 Fig. 9 comprises a concave surface 84 in the coronal plane, convex boundyar surface 861 and convex surfaces 86 and 88, medial wall 90, lateral wall 92 and n U shaped slot defined 94l by posterior wall 94, anterior wall 941 and floor 96. The components 70 and 72, unlike their counterparts 4 and 4 do not include wire markers or keying grooves, but, aside from tis, components 70 and 72 re similar to 4A and 4. In reconstruction of an elbow joint, only one style of components 4, 4A, 70 or 72 need be used. A variety of materials is available from which to construct components 4, 8 and 12. Advantageously, the humeral component is formed of inert plastics material, e.g. high density polyethylene, and the ulnsrcomponent 8 and radial component 12 are advantageously made of corrosion resistant metal, e.g. the chromium containing alloy Alivium . The wimp actors and chisels employable for implanting the prosthesis are advantageously formed of stainless steel or equivalent metal or alloy except for the end of the ulnarimpactor adapted to make contact with the ulnarpreferably metallic prosthesis. The design of the components 4 and 8 as described enables the to be made and used in an average size adaptable to 2 large number of Patients. ov,wever, it should be recognized that different sizes may be necessary and this can be determined by use of differently dimensioned trial components 70 or 72. Instnimentation for reconstruction of an elbow joint is described with reference to Figs. 5 to 7S, 10 and 11. As seen in Fig. 5 humeral impactor 98 sometimes referred to as a pusher comprises a T shaped handle 100 adapted to be fixed in the coronal plane to an integral distal end member 102 having its internal curved pushing surface 104 formed complementarily to the concave convex surface 16 of component 4. This enables impactor 98 to be put in position upon the humeral component easily and be held there accurately while cement hardens during implantation. An ulnar impactor 106 Fig. 6 also has a Tshaped handle 108, but this is adapted to be fixed in the sagittal plane to an integral distal end member 110. The external curved pushing surface 112 is formed complementarily to the articulating surface 44 of component 8 to again provide easy placement and accurate holding during cementing. Bone chisel 114 Fig. 7 comprises a mallet head 116, stem 118, base member 120 and tvic wings 122, each with chisel tips 124. The stem 118is fixed to the base member 120, but offset from the centre thereof for ease of access to the elbow joint.Chisel 114 is used to mark out the antero posterior breath of the humeral bone to be removed in order to fit into the slot 22 of component 4 Fig. 4 . It also marks the depth equivalent to that of the depth of the slot 22 in component 4. Bone chisel 126 Fig. 10 comprises a mallet head 128, stem 130, base member 132, wings 1,4 with inset ends 136 and chisel tips 158. The ins 134 are in a different plane relative to stem 130 from the wings 122 of chisel 114 Fig. 7A . Chisel 126 Fig. 10 is used for accuately marking out the length of humeral bone to be removed and also to mark the depth since the inset ends 136 of the chisel are sized in length i.e. reduced or increased in length to correspond with the length of the body of component 4. Use of chisel 126 to mark out and cut away humeral bone from the humerus 6 is shown in Fig. 15. Chisel 114 Fig. 7A is then used in the t osite plane to mark out the antero posterior breath of bone removal.Upon completion of humeral bone removal in such manner, the humeral component 4, it cement applied to the surfaces of slot 22Is applied to the r ehumerus 6 and held in place with impactor 98 as shorn in Fig. 16 until the cement has set. The keel of the prepared humeral bone sits in the U slot of component 4 and its medial and lateral ends sit against the medial and lateral walls of the prepared lower humerus. Fig. 11 shows a rasp with a mallet head 140, stem 141 and base member 142 having a roughened surface and is employable to clear the surface of the olecranon during implantation of the prosthesis. The ulna is prepared to receive the stem 52 of ulnar component 8 ig. 3 . Cement is then applied to the stem 52 and under surface 54 and the component 8 is inserted into and onto the upper end of the ulna 10. The component 8 is held in position as shown inFig. 17, with impactor 108 until the cement is fully set. In the reconstructed joint, the ulnar component sits on the olecranon process of the ulnar bone and the stem 52 seats within that bone to give good stability to the component 8. A preferred cement for use in the new joint reconstructions is self hardening methyl methacrylate cement, but other body compatible cements may be used. As previously indicated, trial hu neral components a be used in order to assess the depth of humeral bone to be removed and also for sizing of a component to fit a particular patient. It is to be understood that Figs. 15 to 17 are illustrative only and do not attemot to Seict the actual appearance of the operations. Obviously, the actual surgical procedures would be conducted under sterile conditions with the surgeon s hands gloved and there would be flesh around the humerus and ulna. In an elbow joint reconstructed by use of a prosthesis emb ting a referred form of the invention, the articulrting surfaces, e.g. 16 and 44, fit easily together and generally give a range of flexible movement between full extension 00 to flexlon position approximately 140O . Stability is provided, in particular, by the intact medial ligament of the elbow and also by the lateral ligament, the anterior and posterior joint capsule and the adjacent musculature.Hence, any tendency for dislocation of the prosthesis is resisted by the natural anatomy and any lateral shift of the ulna is discouraged by the lateral convex boundary surface 181 of the humeral component 4.This is useful if trauma or undue strain is delivered to the elbow joint. Further, the prosthetic articulating arrangement allows for rotation of the ulna at te elbow, thus adding or mini sing strain on the seating of the two components in strain situations. Liinimal bone is removed in the operative procedure which is a distinct advantage if there should be failure of the prosthesis for any reason, in which event, other surgical procedures can be easily accomplished. The three humeral wire markers allow for accurate visualisation of the prosthesis by X ray which is important in assessing wear and or displacement after accidental trauma or loosening of the humeral component for any reason. Figs. 12S and 123 show the range of pivotal movement of a prosthesis embodying the invention, Fig. 12A showing one extreme position and Fig. 123 showing the other extreme position of possible pivotal movement.Figs. 19 and 20 also illustrate the pivotal movement Fig. 20 providing an angular range of 1400 or more and Fig. 19 shows with the two curved arrows pointing in opposite directions the possibility of medio lateral gliding and limited rotation. Figs. 21 and 22 are concerned with implanted prosthesis employing prosthesis embodying the invention wherein in Fig. 21 a radial component 12 is used fitted to the radius 14 and in Fig. 22 this is omitted, part of the radius bone having been removed by surgery as shown.
