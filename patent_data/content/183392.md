# Geographic blackout method for direct broadcast satellite system.

## Abstract
Television programs are broadcast to a plurality of receiver units in various geographic areas. Each unit Fig. 1 has a memory for storage of designation code representative of its location and a memory for the storage of a blackout tier indication. Prior to the transmission of the program to be blacked out, each unit is separately addressed and provided with a message including a designation code for storage. Then, a globally addressed message Fig. 2 provides all receiver units having a selected designation code with a blackout tier indication for storage Fig. 3 . A program tier indication is transmitted along with the program to be blacked out. Each unit, upon receiving the transmitted program, compares Fig. 4 the transmitted program tier indication and the blackout tier indication in its memory. All receiver units having a stored blackout tier indication which matches the program tier indication are simultaneously prevented from displaying the program to be blacked out.

## Description
The present invention relates to direct broadcast satellite systems and, more particularly, to a geographic blackout method for use with such systems in which all receiver units within a given geographic area are simultaneously prevented from displaying a program to be blacked out through the use of a single command sequence. The invention also relates to a receiver for use in a direct broadcast satellite system. The availability of small, low cost television receive only terminals in recent years has resulted in an increasing demand for direct broadcast satellite services. Such services include Pay TV, tele conferencing, tele seminar, private broadcast networks, and the like. Unlike land lines and terrestrial microwave links, satellite transmissions lack privacy. Such transmissions can be received by any TV receive only terminal whose antenna is situated to receive the satellite signals. Accordingly, secure transmission of video and audio programming and data signals is required to provide the privacy essential to many applications. A simple example of a direct broadcast satellite network in which security is required is one which broadcasts television signals to paying subscribers. Since any receiver having an antenna in the broadcast area can receive the satellite signals, it is necessary that the signals be coded in a way which can be decoded only by the subscriber s receivers. Certain subscribers may have paid for certain programs or program groups, whereas others may have paid for other programs or program groups. The signals must then be further encoded such that subscribers who have paid for particular programs or groups of programs can receive same, while other subscribers cannot. In addition, it may be desirable to design the system such that a particular subscriber can preview a program and then decide whether he or she wishes to watch the program and, hence, pay for the privilage. In such an impulse pay per view system, the decision of the subscriber must be recorded and communicated to a billing facility for appropriate billing. In such instances, the control signals to the subscriber s receiver instructing the receiver how to communicate with the billing office must be secure in order to eliminate the possibilities of theft of the service. In the direct broadcast satellite system in which the present invention is used, programming is distributed through a composite television signal which includes a plurality of levels of programming called tiers. Each tier carries a different variety of programming. A particular program may suit several tiers, much like a library index card listing having several possible topics of interest. Thus, a particular program may appear on one or more tiers. Each tier is assigned a number. The tier number is represented by a bit stream. The bit stream is a series of zeros with a one at the bit corresponding to the tier number. This is referred to herein as the tier indication. If there are, for example, thirty two tiers, tier number three is represented by a bit stream of two zeros, a one, and twenty nine zeros. Each program is distributed along with a program tier indication which is a similar bit stream with a one for the bit corresponding to the tier on which it is distributed. The program and the accompanying program tier indication are distributed to all receiver units. Certain programs, whether paid for by subscription or on an impulse pay per view basis, may be considered by the subscriber as inappropriate for viewing by the household or certain members thereof. Such programs may, for instance, include violent or sexually explicit movies or the like. It is therefore desirable that the satellite system incorporate a means for blocking out the tiers on which such programs are distributed so that they cannot be decoded and displayed by the subscriber s receiver unit. It is preferable that objectionable programming be blocked even if the receiver unit is instructed to display the program as a pay per view item. One way to achieve this is to control individual receiver units by the system operator from the transmission end to block programs and provide a mechanism whereby the program tiers designated for blocking can be changed upon written or telephone communication by the subscriber with the system operator. Further, there are certain instances where it is necessary to black out programming in a particular geographic area. For example, certain sporting events such as baseball games, football games, boxing matches, and the like, are provided to the satellite network for broadcast with the restriction that they not be distributed within the locality in which the sporting event is taking place, so as not to adversely affect attendance at the arena. It is therefore necessary that the satellite network have capability for blacking out selected programming in certain designated geographic areas. In broadcast television, local blackouts are achieved simply by not broadcasting the program over any local affiliate television station in the area to be blacked out. In a direct broadcast satellite delivery system, local area blackouts may be achieved by selectively addressing each subscriber receiver unit in the subject geographic area and then selectively preventing each of the addressed subscriber receiver units from displaying the particular program. However, since there may be a great many perhaps millions different subscriber receiver units located within the geographic area to be blacked out, it may require many minutes or more to sequentially address all of them to achieve the appropriate blackout. A significant time lag, that is, more than tens of seconds, is undesirable since the program prior to the event to be blacked out is typically not blacked out. Thus, if the blackout sequence is begun prior to the transmission of the program to be blacked out, portions of the prior program will also be blacked out. On the other hand, if the sequence is begun at the beginning of the program to be blacked out, subscribers may find it objectionable to receive a portion of the local event and then to observe that the program is being blacked out. In the direct broadcast satellite system in which the present invention is employed, each receiver unit is provided with a memory for storage of a designation code representing its geographic location, and a memory for storage of indications of tiers upon which programs to be blacked out are to be distributed. This latter memory is referred to as the blackout memory and stores the blackout tier indications. After each receiver units is provided with a designation code, the receiver units are globally addressed. Each receiver unit having a selected designation code stored therein is provided with a blackout tier indication for storage. When a program is selected for viewing, the receiver unit compares the program tier indication distributed with the program and the stored blackout tier indication. If the indications match, the selected program cannot be displayed. Thus, the present invention relates to a method designed for use in a direct broadcast satellite system where, in response to a single command sequence program tier indication from the transmission end, all previously defined receiver units having a stored blackout tier indication matching the program tier indication may be simultaneously prevented from displaying a particular program. This method is particularly suitable for blacking out programs in selected geographic areas, but may be applied for other purposes. Because the method is particularly suitable for geographic blackouts, it will be described herein as applied to that purpose. However, the invention should not be sonstrued as limited thereto. There will be described hereinafter a method in accordance with this invention for use in a direct broadcast satellite system for simultaneously blacking out a prgram for all receivers in a designated geographic area. In the method to be described each receiver unit is provided with a storable designation code representing the geographic area in which the unit is located. More particularly, it will be described how the present invention can be applied in a direct broadcast satellite system for simultaneously blacking out a program for all receivers in a particular geographic area wherein blackout tier indications are globally distributed for storage in all receiver units having a particular stored designation code. Furthermore in the method to be described the program to be blacked out is broadcast with a program tier indication and all receivers having a stored blackout tier indication matching the transmitted program tier indication are prevented from displaying the program. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a method for simultaneously preventing the display of a program by selected receivers is provided for use in a direct broadcast satellite system. The system is of the type including a plurality of receiver units, some of which are selected as being unable to display a given program. Each unit comprises a memory. Prior to the transmission of a program which cannot be displayed by selected units, each unit is addressed and provided with a designation code for storage in its memory. All receiver units are then addressed and those having a selected designation code stored therein are provided with given indication for storage. Each program is transmitted with an associated program indication. Each of the receiver units, upon receiving a transmitted program, compares the program indication transmitted with the program and the stored indication. Receiver units having a stored indication matching the transmitted program indication are unable to display the transmitted program. In the preferred practice of the above method each of the receiver units has a unique address code. An address code is transmitted with the encrypted message including the designation code. A particular receiver unit can decrypt the encrypted message only if the transmitted address code transmitted therewith matches the address code of the receiver. All receiver units can be addressed using a global address. The global address is transmitted with a message containing the selected designation code and given indication. Each receiver having a stored designation code matching the designation code in the message stores the given designation in the message. The given indication comprises a plurality of bits. The memory comprises a bit map memory. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a method for simultaneously blacking out a program from all receiver units in a selected geographic area is provided for use in a direct broadcast satellite system. The system is of the type including a plurality of receiver units in various geographic areas. Each receiver unit has a designation code memory and a blackout tier memory. Each receiver unit is separately addressed and provided with a designation code for storage in its designation code memory. Different designation codes represent different geographic areas. Each designation code is selected in turn, and for each designation code, a blackout tier indication is provided for storage in the blackout tier memory of each receiver unit having a matching designation code stored in its designation code memory. A signal is transmitted to all receiver units including various programs, each of which is accompanied by a program tier indication. Each receiver unit, upon receiving the transmitted signal, compares the program tier indication accompanying each program with the blackout tier indication in its blackout tier memory. Any receiver unit having a stored blackout tier indication corresponding to the transmitted program tier indication accompanying a program is unable to display that program. Preferably the transmitted signal includes a data stream. The data stream includes a plurality of addressable portions. The blackout tier indication is provided by generating an addressable portion addressed to all receiver units commanding all receiver units having a given stored designation code to store the blackout tier indication in the addressed portion. Each of the receiver units has a unique address. Each receiver unit is addressed by incorporating the address thereof in the addressable portion which includes the designation code for the addressed receiver unit, as well as a message for the receiver unit to enter the designation code into its designation code memory. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a receiver unit is provided for use in a direct broadcast satellite system. The system includes a plurality of receiver units and a transmission station for generating a composite television signal including program information including programs on a plurality of tiers, and an addressable data stream including program tier indications for each program tier, designation code information addressable to a particular receiver unit, and globally addressed blackout tier indications, the receiver comprising means for receiving the composite television signal, means for locating the portion of the addressable data stream containing the designation code information addressed to the receiver unit, means for storing the designation code information, means for locating the globally addressed blackout tier indication corresponding to the stored designation code information, means for selecting a program for display, means for obtaining the program tier indication for the selected program, means for comparing the program tier indication with the stored blackout tier indication, and means for displaying the selected program if said compared indications do not match. The present invention will be further described in relation to a geographic blackout method for use in a direct broadcast satellite system, the description being taken together with the accompanying drawings, wherein like numerals refer to like parts, and in which Mention is made below of the sending of a data stream using encrypted messages. Further detail on encryption and decoding of messages for use in a network can be obtained from out co pending European Patent Application No 85307456.5 publication No . The direct broadcast satellite network now to be discussed is designed to supply television programming to a large number of subscriber receiver units distributed in various geographic areas. Each geographic area may have a large number of subscriber receiver units contained therein. Each of the subscriber units is supplied, via satellite, with a number of different programming tiers. Each subscriber, upon entering the network, obtains a receiver unit which includes a signal tuner and modulation section and an addressable controller decoder for use in conjunction with the subscriber s television. Each subscriber chooses one or more of the programming tiers to be received on a subscription basis. The subscriber pays the system operator a periodic fee, for example monthly, which entitles him her to view the programs on the tiers he she has selected and paid for. Other tiers of programming can be paid for on impulse on a pay per view basis. Programs eligible for viewing on an impulse pay per view basis are previewable by the subscriber by permitting the subscriber to view the beginning of the program, for example, the first five minutes thereof, after which the subscriber must decide whether to pay for the privilege of viewing the remainder of the program. In order to view a program eligible for an impulse pay per view transaction, the subscriber enters a secret pass code on a keyboard associated with the tuning section of the receiver unit. The addressable controller decoder connected therewith will enter certain information into a memory relating to the identification number of the program being viewed, the time and date of the viewing, and the cost which the subscriber will have to pay for the privilege of viewing the program. Periodically, the addressable controller decoder will receive instructions from the system operator to forward the accumulated data relating to the previous impulse pay per view transactions and provide same to the system operator for billing purposes. This can be done in one of two ways. If the addressable controller decoder has telephone communications capability, that is, provided with a modem connected to a telephone line, and the necessary circuitry to operate the modem, the controllable addressable decoder will call a computer located at the transmission end and, after the appropriate identification procedure, will transfer the information concerning the impulse pay per view transactions stored in the addressable controller decoder memory to the computer at the transmission end. That computer will then periodically generate a bill which will be mailed to the subscriber. If the addressable controller decoder does not have telephone communications capability, a credit card type device can be utilized for billing purposes. The credit card type device is essentially a memory on a card which is inserted into a slot provided on the addressable controller decoder. Upon receiving the appropriate commands from the transmission end, the addressable controller decoder will transfer its stored information concerning the impulse pay per view transactions onto the card memory. The subscriber will then mail the card memory to the system operator who will then access the card memory to ascertain the impulse pay per view transactions and provide the subscriber with a bill in accordance therewith. Certain programming, whether eligible through subscription or through impulse pay per view transaction, must be prevented from display on designated receiver units. Such programming may incorporate content which is objectionable for some reason or may relate to particular programming, such as sporting events, which are taking place locally and must be blacked out. In order to maintain attendance at such sporting events at a high level, the program is distributed with the restriction that the program will not be viewable with the geographic area in which it is taking place. There will now be described a method in accordance with this invention for preventing the display of selected programming by designated receiver units. It is particularly adaptable for use in simultaneously blacking out particular programs in designated geographic areas. In order to black out all the receiver units in a particular geographic area, it is normally necessary to access each unit and provide same with the necessary blackout instructions. Since there may be hundreds of thousands or even millions of receiver units in a particular geographic area, accessing each unit in order to provide it with blackout information will require a relatively long time. If instructions to black out programming on a particular tier are distributed prior to the commencement of the grogram to be blacked out, this may interrupt the viewing of the prior program, which is normally not blacked out, a result which is to be avoided. On the other hand, if the distribution of the blackout command information does not take place until the program to be blacked out commences, certain viewers will be able to view the beginning portion of the program and will be blacked out a few minutes into the program, which may cause annoyance. The now proposed method overcomes these problems by providing each receiver unit and, particularly the addressable controller decoder portion thereof, with a blackout tier indication memory in the form of a blackout bit map memory and a receiver unit designation code memory. Each unit is addressed and provided with a designation code, in this case, a code which reflects the geographic location of the receiver unit. The designation code is stored in the unit. The units are then globally addressed and provided with a selected designation code and a blackout tier indication. The blackout tier indication represents a particular programming tier to be blacked out on all receiver units having the selected designation code. If the stored designation code matches the designation code being transmitted, the blackout tier indication is stored in the receiver blackout bit map memory. This takes place prior to the transmission of the program to be blacked out. Each program is transmitted in association with a program tier indication. If the program is to be blacked out in a particular geographic area represented by a given designation code, the program tier indication will match the blackout tier indication previously stored in all receiver units having that stored designation code. Upon receiving a program, each receiver unit compares the program tier indication transmitted therewith and the blackout tier indication in its blackout bit map memory. If the indications match, the program cannot be displayed. Otherwise, the program is displayed as usual. Thus, all receivers in a selected geographic area will be blacked out to be prevented from displaying the program. Each receiver unit also has a tier authorization memory in the form of an authorization bit map memory and a tier blocking memory in the form of a blocking bit map memory. Indications relating to programming tiers not selected for subscriptions are stored in the authorization bit map memory. Indications relating to tiers to be blocked by the system operator are stored in the blocking bit map memory. Authorization tier indications and blocking tier indications are distributed in addressable portions of the data stream in the composite television signal in the same way as the designation code. While the various bit map memory facilities are referred to herein as separate memories, it should be understood that same may, in reality, be different areas of the same memory circuit. Fig. 1 graphically depicts the manner in which the authorization bit map memory, blocking bit map memory, and blackout bit map memory are utilized within the addressable controller decoder. Each bit map is an array of bits equal to the number of programming tiers, for example, 32 bits corresponding to 32 programming tiers. Thus, each bit represents a tier. Each bit in each array is tested with each corresponding bit in each other array to determine whether programming on a selected tier may be displayed. Only six tiers of programming, S₀...S₅, are shown for purposes of illustration, but it is understood that many more tiers of programming can be utilized. Programming tiers S₀ and S₃ are programming tiers which have been paid for by subscription and contain, for example, commercial programming which can be viewed without further action on the part of the subscriber. Programming tiers S₁ and S₂, for example, contain R rated and PG rated movies thereon, respectively. Both programming tiers S₁ and S₂ are eligible for impulse pay per view transactions as the addressable controller decoder has previously received instructions authorizing the viewing of these tiers on this basis. However, the subscriber does not wish to have certain members of the household view the R rated movies on programming tier S₁. This has been previously communicated to the system operator who has then provided the subscriber s addressable controller decoder with particular commands such that the blocking bit map contained in the subscriber s addressable controller decoder memory has been set to block the display of programming tier S₁, even if the appropriate passcode is entered into the controller which would normally permit the subscriber unit to display the program and charge the subscriber for the privilege. Programming tiers S₃ and S₄ contain sports programs thereon. Programming tier S₃, like tier S₀, is part of the subscription and, hence, need not be authorized for impulse pay per view transactions. It is not blocked or blacked out and, therefore, can be viewed. However, the programming on tier S₄ has been blacked out of the geographic area in which the subscriber unit is situated. Accordingly, the addressable controller decoder will not permit the programming in tier S₄ to be displayed. The programming on tier S₅, like the programming on tier S₂, is eligible for impulse pay per view transactions. Since this programming has not been blocked and has not been blacked out, it can be viewed by the entrance of the appropriate passcode at the keyboard of the receiver unit. The program will then be displayed and the subscriber charged for the privilege. Control data is distributed to the subscriber units through a data stream which is situated in consecutive horizontal blanking intervals within the composite television broadcast signal. The data stream is described in detail below. In general, the data stream includes a header packet which contains a group address, certain program related information, including a program tier indication for each program being distributed, and certain impulse pay per view information such as an identification number relating to a particular program eligible for an impulse pay per view transaction and the cost of viewing same. This type of information is generally applicable to all receiver units in the addressed group. The data stream also includes a plurality of addressable packets containing encrypted messages applicable to the control of particular subscriber units within the addressed group. Each subscriber unit has an individual address number. An addressable packet is addressed to a particular subscriber unit by including therein the subscriber unit s individual address number. Only the subscriber unit with that individual address number can receive and decode the message in that addressed packet. The addressed packet may contain a selected one of several different messages along with the information necessary for the particular addressed subscriber unit to decode the message. For example, a particular message may cause the addressed subscriber unit to load a designation code into its designation code memory. Another message may cause the storage of blackout tier indications into a blackout bit map memory. Other messages may cause an addressed receiver unit to be provided with authorization tier indications to set its authorization bit map memory, or with blocking tier indications to set its blocking bit map memory. It is also possible to utilize an addressable packet to send a global message, that is, a message applicable to the control of all receiver units within the addressed group. The global message is sent in clear or unencrypted form. In this case, a global address, for example all ones, is utilized. Such a message, for instance, may be a command for all subscriber units in the group having a particular stored designation to perform a certain function. The system thus far described is initialized by separately addressing each subscriber unit in each group within the network and commanding each addressed subscriber unit to enter a particular designation code, contained within a message in the addressable packet, in its designation code memory. Different geographic areas are assigned different designation codes. Thus, all subscriber units in a particular geographic area will have the same designation code stored in their designation code memories. After the designation codes are stored in all subscriber units, each designation code is selected, in turn, and the blackout bit map memory of each subscriber unit having the selected designation code is set or reset . This is accomplished by sending a global message in an addressable packet of the data stream in which a global address, such as a series of ones, is contained commanding all subscriber units in the system to load a particular sequence of bits, which form the blackout tier indication, into their blackout bit map memory if the designation code previously stored in the unit matches the designation code in the message. After this occurs, the next designation code will be selected and a global message will be sent instructing all subscriber units having that designation code to set or reset their respective blackout bit map memories with a particular blackout tier indication. The process continues until the blackout bit map memories of all receivers in each geographic area have been set. This is illustrated in Fig. 2. As illustrated in Fig. 3, each receiver unit receives the composite television signal and looks for an addressed packet with its unit address. Each addressed packet with a unit address contains a message type indication, an encrypted message, and decryption information. One message type represents a command to set the designation code memory with a designation code contained in the message. Other message types represent commands to set the authorization bit map memory, blocking bit map memory, or perform other functions. The receiver unit decrypts the message and performs the designated function, i.e., store the designation code in its designation code memory. A global message, that is, an addressed packet with a global address will then be sent. The message contains a designation code and a blackout tier indication in clear or unencrypted form. If the stored designation code matches the designation code in the designation memory, the receiver unit will store the blackout tier indication in its blackout bit map memory. Each program broadcast over the composite television signal has a header packet associated therewith which contains the program tier indication associated with that program. As illustrated in Fig. 4, when the composite television signal is received by the subscriber unit, the subscriber will select a program for display. The subscriber unit located at the header packet in the addressable data stream corresponding to the selected program and obtains the program tier indication therein. The subscriber unit will then access the program tier indication from the header with the stored blocking tier indication. If the indications match, that is, if there is a one bit at the same location, the program will be blocked and cannot be displayed by the receiver unit. Next, the blackout bit map memory will be accessed and the program tier indication compared with the blackout tier indication. If the indications match, that is, if there is a one bit in the program tier indication at the same location as the one bit in the blackout bit map memory, the program will not be displayed. Finally, the authorization bit map memory is accessed. If the program tier indication matches the authorization tier indication, an impulse pay per view transaction must take place before the program can be viewed. Otherwise, the program is within the subscription and can be displayed without further action on the part of the subscriber. Fig. 5 schematically represents the type of composite TV signal distributed by the direct broadcast satellite network. This signal comprises a plurality of active video portions, sync portions, and horizontal blanking interval portions. A data stream, including digitized audio signals and control data, is inserted into consecutive horizontal blanking intervals of the composite television signal. The data stream includes a run in code portion, an addressable data stream portion, an encrypted audio signal portion, an audio code portion indicating whether the audio channels being broadcast are stereo or bilingual, a video inversion code required to descramble the video signals, and a spare bit portion. The addressable data stream portion includes a header packet for each program being distributed and a plurality of addressable packets. As mentioned above, global information may be contained in an addressable packet containing a global address, for example, all ones. Information relating to the control of specific receiver units is contained in addressable packets including the unique address number of the particular receiver unit. Each of the addressable packets includes an address portion, which is either global in nature or specific to a particular subscriber. In packets addressed to specific subscriber units, the address portion is followed by an encrypted message and information which will enable the addressed subscriber unit to decode the message. Encrypted messages of various types, containing a variety of different kinds of control data, can be distributed in this fashion. For purposes of this application, it is sufficient to understand that one type of encrypted message may be a command to the addressed subscriber unit to load a particular designation code into its designation code memory. Another type of encrypted message may be a command for the subscriber unit to load a particular blocking tier indication into its blocking bit map memory. Still another type of encrypted message may be a command to set the authorization bit map memory with an authorization tier indication. One type of message is illustrated as addressable packet 1. This packet includes the subscriber unit address for one specific unit, an indication of the message type i.e., command to set designation code memory , the message designation code to be stored in memory , and the necessary information for the addressed unit to decrypt the message. A globally addressed message is illustrated as addressable packet 2. This message contains a global address meaning it is applicable to all receiver units in the system and an indication of the message type a command to set the blackout bit map memory if the designation code in the message matches the designation code previously stored in the designation code memory . This addressable packet also contains a message containing the designation code to be compared and the blackout tier indication to be stored. After the broadcast of the program to be blacked out, another global message is sent to all receiver units through the data stream. This global message commands all receiver units to reset their respective blackout bit map memories to zero, thereby erasing the blackout information. Once this occurs, the programming on the tier previously designated for blackout will be able to be viewed. In this manner, the blackout bit map memory can be set and reset as required. While, for simplicity, the present application has discussed the blackout of a single program tier at a time, it should be appreciated that several tiers can be blacked out at the same time by distributing a blackout tier indication which includes one bits at locations representing several tiers. For example, blacking out tiers two and four would require a thirty two bit stream with ones at the second and fourth bit. Thus, the term indication as used herein refers to a bit stream having ones in positions which correspond to one or more tier numbers. It will now be appreciated that the method and system described permits all subscriber units located in a particular geographic area to black out a particular program upon the receipt of a given program tier indication associated with the program. This can occur because the particular subscriber units within the geographic area to be blacked out have previously been provided with a given blackout tier indication. The subscriber units within each geographic area have previously been loaded with designation codes representing the area in which the unit is located. Since the designation codes and the blackout tier indications are distributed and stored prior to the broadcast of the programming to be blacked out, this can be done over a relatively long time without disrupting the operation of the system. Setting up the system in this way permits the program to be blacked out in all receiver units within the designated geographic area simultaneously.
