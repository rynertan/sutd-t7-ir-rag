# Wraparound article carrier with adjustable girth.

## Abstract
An article carrier of the wraparound type comprising a blank of generally rectangular configuration having lap panels 33, 34 at its ends which may be overlapped and secured to gether in flat face containing relation in alternate relative posi tions of long and short overlaps to form tubular structures of different girths. A least one pair of tightening apertures 47 49 47a 49a formed respectively in said lap panels for receiving machine tightening elements operabie to impart tightening action to said blank when disposed about a group of articles. One pair of tightening apertures are spaced a prede termined distance from one longitudinal edge of said blank, and a second pair of tightening apertures 50 52 50a 52a are spaced a predetermined distance from the longitudinal edge of said blank which is opposite from said one longitudinal edge thereby to adapt the carrier blank for transverse orientation in different positions relative to the associated group of articles. The spacing between the apertures of each pair of tightening apetures being different in a direction longitudinally of the blank.
