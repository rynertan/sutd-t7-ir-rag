# Photographic silver complex diffusion transfer reversal process.

## Abstract
Photographic silver complex diffusion transfer reversal process wherein the photographic material is spectrally sensitized with a dye corresponding to the general formula of the description, wherein said dye provides to the silver halide emulsion layer a spectral sensitivity mainly in the range of 400 to 500 nm and does not extend its spectral sensitivity substantially beyond 500 nm, and wherein the handling exposure, development and diffusion transfer of the photographic material during said steps is effected in yellow safelight corresponding to the light transmitted by a specified cut off filter without causing fog.
