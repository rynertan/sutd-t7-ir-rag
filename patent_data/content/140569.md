# Robot hand.

## Abstract
A robot arm includes an outer casing 8 and three rotating members 2, 3, 4 of different diameters coaxially disposed in the outer casing for relative rotation and rock ably supporting the proximal end portions of three fingers 9, 10, 11 . These fingers are rocked against the rotating members in a plane including a central axis of the outer casing and rotated to change the relative angles between the fingers by selectively rotating the members 2, 3, 4 around the central axis of the outer casing to prescribed positions.
