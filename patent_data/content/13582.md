The mixture of sulprofos and the pyrethroid insecticides produces a surprising synergistic effect, for example with respect to aphids, for example Aphis fabea, the black bean aphid. The invention therefore also provides a method of combating pests at a locus which comprises applying to that locus a pesticidal esmposltisn aceordirE to t nsrz .tio .. The pesticidal composition according to the invention preferably also comprises a carrier, especially at least two carriers, at least one of which is a surface active agent. This invention also provides a process for preparing a pesticidal composition which comprises bringing a compound of formula I and a pyrethroid insecticide of formula II into association with at least one carrier therefor. A carrier in a composition according to the invention is any material with which the active ingredient is formulated to facilitate application to the locus to be treated, which may for example be a plant, seed or soil, or to facilitate storage, transport or handling. A carrier may be a solid or a liquid, including a material which is normally gaseous but which has been compressed to form a liquid, and any of the carriers normally used in formulating pesticidal compositions may be used. Suitable solid carriers include natural and synthetic clays and silicates, for example natural silicas such as diatomacious earths magnesium silicates, for example talcs magnesium aluminium silicates, for example attap and vermiculites aluminium silicates, for exam kaclinites, montmorillonites and micas calcium carbonate calcium sulphate synthetic hydrated silicon oxides and synthetic calcium or aluminium silicates elements, for example carbon and sulphur natural and syntnetic resins, for example coumarone resins, polyvinyl cnloride, and styrene polymers and copolymers solid polychlorophenols bitumen waxes, for example beeswax, paraffin wax, and chlorinated mineral waxes and solid fertilisers, for example superphosphates. Suitable liquid carriers include water alcohols, for example isopropanol and glycols ketones. for example acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone ethers aromatic or araliphatic hydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene and xylene petroleum fractions, for example kerosine and light mineral oils chlorinated hydrocarbons, for example carbon tetrachloride, perchloroethylene and trichloroethane. Mixtures of different liquids are often suitable. Pesticidal compositions are often formulated and transported in a concentrated form which is subsequently diluted by the user before application. The presence of small amounts of a carrier which is a surface active agent facilitates this process of dilution. A surface active agent may be an equlsitying agent, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent it lay be nonionic or ionic. Examples of suitable surface active agents include the sodium or calcium salts of polyacrylic acids and lignin sulphonic acids the condensation products of fatty acids or aliphatic amines or amides containing at least 12 carbon atoms in the molecule with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide fatty acid esters of glycerol, sorbitan, sucrose or pentaerythritol condensates of these with ethylene oxide andior propylene oxide condensation products of fatty alcohol or alkyl phenols, for example p octyl phenol or E octylcresol, with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide sulphates or sulphonates of these condensation products alkali or alkaline earth metal salts, preferably sodium salts, of sulphuric or sulphonic acid esters containing at least 10 carbon atoms in the molecule, for example sodium lauryl sulphate, sodium secondary alkyl sulphates, sodium salts of sulphonated castor oil, and sodium alkylaryl sulphonztes such as sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate and polymers of ethylene oxide and copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. The compositions of the invention may for example be formulated as wettable powders, dusts, granules, solutions, emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, suspension concentrates and aerosols. Wettable powders usually contain 25, 50 and 75 w of active ingredient and usually contain, in addition to solid inert carrier, 3 10 w of a dispersing agent and, where necessary, 0 10 w of stabiliser s and or other additives such as penetrants or stickers. Dusts are usually formulated as a dust concentrate having a similar composition to that of a wettable powder but without a dispersant, and are diluted in the field with further solid carrier to give a composition usually containing i 10 w of active ingredient.Granules are usually prepared to have a size between 10 and 100 BS mesh 1.676 0.152 mm , and may be manufactured by agglomeration or impregnation techniques. Generally, granules will contain i 25S w active ingredient and 0 10 w of additives such as stabilisers, slow release modifiers and binding agents.Emulsifiable concentrates usually contain, in addition to a solvent and, when necessary, co solvent, 10 50 w v active ingredient, 2 20 w v emulsifiers and 0 20S w v of other additives such as stabilisers, penetrants and corrosion inhibitors. Suspension concentrates are usually compounded so as to obtain a stable, nonsedimenting flowable product and usually contain 10 752 w active ingredient, 0.5 158 w of dispersing agents, 0.1 10 w of suspending agents such as protective colloids and thixotropic agents, 0 10S w of other additives such as defoamers, corrosion inhibitors, stabilisers, penetrants and stickers, and water or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient is substantially insoluble certain organic solids or inorganic salts may be present dissolved in the formul ation to assist in preventing, sedimentation or as antifreeze agents for water. Aqueous dispersions and emulsions, for example compositions obtained by diluting a wettable powder or a concentrate according to the invention with water, also lie within the scope of the present invention. The said emulsions may be of the water in oil or of the oil inwater type, and may have a thick mayonnaise like consistency. The compositions of the invention may also contain other ingredients, for example, other compounds possessing pesticidal, herbicidal or fungicidal properties. The following Example illustrates the invention.ExampleActivity of Pyrethroid Sulprofos mixtures against Aphis fabae black bean aphid The activities against Aphis fabae of sulprofos, the pyrethroid insecticide of formulaEMI8.1 known as permethrin, the pyrethroid insecticide of formulaEMI8.2 known as fenvalerate, and mixtures of sulprofos with each of these two pyrethroid insecticides, were assessed by the following method. Test solutions or suspensions were made up in water containing 0.4 by weight active ingredient, 20 by weight acetone and 0.5 by weight Triton X 100 TradeMark . These solutions or suspensions were subsequently diluted to produce compositions containing various concentrations of active ingredient. Pairs of leaves were removed from broad bean plants and placed ventral side uppermost on filter paper inside petri dishes. The leaves were sprayed with the test solution using a logarithmic spraying machine and a dosage equivalent to 400 litres hectare, and allowed to dry for i 1 hour. Each leaf pair was infested with 10 aphids. Temperature was held constant at 23 C 2 C, humidity and light fluctuated. The number of dead and moribund insects was counted after 24 hours. From the results, the LC50 the lethal dosage in percentage by weight required to kill 50S of the test insects was calculated. Toxicity indices were then calculated using the following formula LC50 of standard Toxicity Index x 100 LC50 of compound or mixtureThe standard used was ethyl parathion. The joint action of the two active components of a mixture was analysed by the method of Yun Pei Sun andE.R. Johnson, Journal of Economic Entomology, 1960, Vol.53 no. 5, pp. 887 892. A coefficient of co toxicity of a mixture is given by coefficient of actual toxicity index of mixture x 100 co toxicity of theoretical toxicity index of mixture mixture The theoretioal toxicity index of a mixture is equal to the sum over both components of the percentage of each individual compound present n the mixture multiplied by its respective coxictçy index. A coefficient of co toxicity of a mixture near 100 indicates the probability of similar action by the two compounds independent action usually gives a coefficient less than 100 and a coefficient significantly above 100 strongly indicates synergism.
