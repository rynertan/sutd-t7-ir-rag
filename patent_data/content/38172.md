# A process for preparing artificial red cells.

## Abstract
A process for preparing artificial red cells comprising microdroplets of aqueous, stroma free haemoglobin solution encapsulated in membranes of polymerized haemoglobin, said process comprising forming microdroplets of haemoglobin so lution in a continuous oil phase and cross linking the haemo globin at the surface of the microdroplets with a suitable oil soluble cross linking agent to form the artificial red cells and recovering the cells. The oil soluble cross linking agent is present in the oil phase containing the haemoglobin micro droplets and the red cells are remove from the oil phase by contacting same with an aqueous suspending phase contain ing a surfactant having an HLB of at least 9.
