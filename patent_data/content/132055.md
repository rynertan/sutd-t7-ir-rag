# Precipitation hardening nickel base alloy and method of producing same.

## Abstract
A precipitation hardening Ni base alloy exhibiting impr oved resistance to corrosion under a corrosive environment containing at least one of hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide and chloride ions and method of producing the same are disclosed. The alloy is of the γ phase, or γ γ phase precipitation hardening type in which Ti is restricted to less than 0.40 and is comprised of C not greater than 0.050 , Si not greater than 0.50 , Mn not greater than 2.0 , Ni 40 60 , Cr 18 27 , Ti less than 0.40 , Mo 2.5 5.5 and or W not greater than 11 ,t 2.5 Mo 1 2W 5.5 , Al not greater than than 2.0 , Nb 2.5 6.0 and or Ta not greater than 2.0 , 2.5 Nb 1 2Ta 6.0 .
