# Novel CSF and method for obtaining the same.

## Abstract
A novel colony stimulating factor CSF that has the ability to promote the differentiation and proliferation of human bone marrow cells to neutrophiles, and a method for obtaining the same are disclosed. This CSF is produced from a novel cell line which has been established from tumor cells in patients with oral cancer. This CSF has the potential for use not only as a curative for leukopenia but also as a reagent for clinical testing and research studies.
