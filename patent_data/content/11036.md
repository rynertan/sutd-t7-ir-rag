# CONTROL DEVICE FOR HYDRAULIC MECHANISMS

## Abstract
A control system for hydraulic servomechanisms com prising a doubleacting jack the working chambers of which are selectively and alternately connectable to a source of pressurized fluid and to a fluid discharge through a reactive switching valve which itself is operated by a control member. According to the invention, there are provided between the valve and each working chamber of the jack means for intercepting the passage of fluid toward said chamber as long as the upstream pressure does not reach a predeter mined threshold value. The application may be advantageously used in power assisted steering systems for automotive vehicles.
