# A method of shaping metal.

## Abstract
A method of shaping metal in the form of a parallel sided elongate sheet 1 to make from it a formed profile 7 that is of uniform cross section except that at least one longitudinal edge 4,5 is worked to generate a repeating pattern along its length, comprising cold working the metal sheet successively a by rolling 2 to increase the width W of the sheet, b with one or more than one knurling wheel 3 that generates the repeating pattern in the longitudinal edge or edges of the metal sheet and at the same time reduces the width of the metal sheet to substantially its original value, and c by roll forming b to the said profile, which may for example be a channel 7 of substantially U shaped cross section.
