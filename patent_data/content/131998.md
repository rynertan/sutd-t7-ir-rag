## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF ETHANOL AND OR ETHYL ACETATE The invention relates to a process for the preparation of ethanol and or ethyl acetate by reaction of methanol with carbon monoxide or a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst system containing a ruthenium compound and an organic nitrogen compound. There is a lively interest in processes by which, starting from synthesis gas CO H2 optionally obtained from coal or natural gas, ethanol can be produced on a technical scale and in an economically justifiable manner. Since processes for producing methanol from carbon monoxide and hydrogen have already been developed on a commercial scale, it would seem attractive to have the preparation of ethanol from synthesis gas be realised via methanol. Although the conversion of methanol into ethanol by reaction with synthesis gas has been studied extensively, as is seen for instance from a review article by H. Bahrmann, W. Lipps and B. Cornils in ChemikerZeitung 106, pp. 249 258 1982 , the known methods still have various drawbacks. So far the best results have been obtained by using homogeneous cobalt containing catalysts to which a ruthenium compound and or an iodide or bromide and or phosphine has been added in order to enhance conversion and or selectivity. However, one of the drawbacks of the use of such cobalt containing catalyst systems is that in order to achieve optimum results it is necessary to use a high pressure of 150 600 bar, usually of about 200 270 bar. When carrying out the process on a technical scale this is rather unattractive for economic reasons, for instance because unconverted synthesis gas, methanol and some by products have to be recirculated to the highpressure reactor. Besides, the number of by products formed in this process is very large and hinders the production of pure ethanol.On top of this some of the by products, such as l,l dimethoxyethane, are not very suitable for recirculation to the reactor. Another serious drawback is that during the cobalt compound catalysed reaction of methanol with synthesis gas water is formed. According to the reaction equation.EMI2.1 mentioned in, for instance, UK patent application No. 2,036,739 A one molecule of water is formed per molecule of ethanol The presence of water in the reaction mixture has an unfavourable influence on catalyst stability and it is the reason why distillate processing of the reaction mixture yields nothing but ethanol water mixtures. US patent specification No. 4,301,312 H.M. Feder and M.J.Chen describes a process in which the formation of water is reduced to a minimum and ethanol is produced according to the reaction equation following EMI2.2 The reaction is carried out in the presence of certain tertiary amines such as trimethylamine and N methylpyrrolidine and an iron or ruthenium carbonyl compound. Publications by M.J. Chen, H.M.Feder and J.W. Rathke in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 104, 7346 7347 1982 andJournal of Molecular Catalysis 17, 331 337 1982 show that reaction II is also catalysed by carbonyl compounds and manganese and rhodium, and that the best results are obtained by using an Mn2 CO IO Fe CO S catalyst. It is further mentioned that the addition of methyl iodide enhances the activity but not the selectivity of the manganese carbonyl compound. However, the Feder et al. method, like the afore mentioned process in which a cobalt containing catalyst is used, has the drawback that high pressures about 300 bar must necessarily be used. US patent specification No. 4,370,507 describes a process for the preparation of ethanol by reaction of methanol with carbon monoxide and hydrogen at a low pressure about 16 bar in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst containing rhodium and iron in a reduced state supported on a carrier of aluminium oxide which has been impregnated with a heterocyclic amine, in particular pyridine.However, this process has the drawback that, among other things, water and large amounts of hydrocarbons are formed as by products.Moreover from the test results mentioned in this patent specification it may be concluded that a considerable portion of the methanol decomposes to form a mixture of CO and H2. A process has now been found in which by reaction of methanol with carbon monoxide or carbon monoxide and hydrogen, ethanol can be prepared at a low pressure with good selectivity, without water being produced as by product. As second product ethyl acetate is formed, a compound which finds application on a large scale as solvent. If desired, ethyl acetate can also be obtained as main product, and therefore the invention also relates to the direct preparation of ethyl acetate from methanol and synthesis gas. The invention relates to a process for the preparation of ethanol andfor ethyl acetate by reaction of methanol with carbon monoxide or a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst system containing a ruthenium compound and an organic nitrogen compound, characterized in that an iodide and or bromide of an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal is present in the reaction mixture and that the organic nitrogen compound comprises an aromatic heterocyclic amine or an oxide thereof or contains a groupEMI3.1 The catalyst system in addition to the ruthenium compound preferably also contains a rhodium compound. The formation of ethanol and ethyl acetate occurs according to the following overall reaction equations EMI3.2 It is not imperative that the hydrogen used in reaction III should be introduced from outside. As has been stated before, the process according to the invention can be carried out both by using carbon monoxide and by using mixtures of carbon monoxide and hydrogen the fact is that under the influence of the catalyst system used according to the invention hydrogen is formed in situ according to the reaction equation EMI3.3 The water used in reaction V may be formed, for instance, by the reaction equation EMI3.4 The by product methyl acetate formed according to reaction VI can contribute optionally after isolation from the reaction mixture and recirculation to the reactor to the formation of additional quantities of ethyl acetate according to the reaction equation EMI4.1 From the acetic acid formed methyl acetate can be formed again according to the reaction equation EMI4.2 The water released in reaction VIII also decomposes according to reaction equation V to form carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The by products formed in the process according to the invention are almost exclusively methyl acetate, methane, carbon dioxide and acetic acid, if any. As stated hereinbefore, methyl acetate and acetic acid can contribute to the formation of ethyl acetate. Of compounds such as acetaldehyde and l,l dimethoxyethane, which are often formed as by products in the preparation of ethanol by reaction of methanol with carbon monoxide and hydrogen not more than traces are found. Water formed during the process decomposes according to reaction V, so that in the end the reaction mixture formed will be free of water. The choice of the ruthenium compound used in the process according to the invention is not very critical. Suitable for instance are ruthenium compounds such as ruthenium III chloride, ruthenium III chloride trihydrate, ruthenium III bromide, ruthenium III nitrate, the ruthenium oxides, organic ruthenium salts, such as ruthenium acetate, ruthenium propionate, ruthenium butyrate and ruthenium naphthenate, carbonyl compounds such for instance as Ru CO s, H4Ru4 CO 12 and RuC13 CO 3 and organic complexes such for instance as ruthenium III acetyl acetonate. The choice of the rhodium compound preferred in the catalyst system is also little critical. Suitable are for instance rhodium compounds such as the rhodium oxides Rh203 and RhO2, rhodium III chloride, rhodium III chloride trihydrate, rhodium III bromide and rhodium III iodide, rhodium III sulphate, organic rhodium salts such as rhodium formate, rhodium acetate, rhodium butyrate and rhodium naphthenate, carbonyl compounds such as dirhodium octacarbonyl, tetrarhodium dodecacarbonyl and hexarhodium hexadecacarbonyl and complexes such as dichlorobis triphenylphosphine rhodium, tris pyridine rhodium III chloride and rhodiumdicarbonyl acetyl acetonate. If the catalyst system contains both ruthenium and rhodium, the ratio of the number of gram atoms ruthenium to the number of gram atoms rhodium preferably lies between 50 1 and 1 5, in particular between 20 1 and 1 2. It is an essential characteristic of the process according to the invention that the reaction is carried out in the presence of an iodide and or bromide of an alkali or alkaline earth metal. If instead of such an iodide or bromide use is made for instance of methyl iodide or zinc iodide, then the formation of ethers and or acetic acid will be predominant. However, this does not exclude the possibility of methyl iodide or bromide or any other iodine or bromine compound being added to the reaction mixture, for instance in order to supplement iodine or bromine discharged from the reactor during continuous operation of the process according to the invention, for instance as methyl iodide or methyl bromide formed from the alkali metal iodide or bromide.Suitable iodides or bromides of alkali or alkaline earth metals are LiI, NaI, KI, RbI, CsI, LiBr,NaBr, KBr, RbBr, CsBr, MgI2, CaI2, SrI2, Bawl2, MgBrZ, CaBr2, SrBr2 and BaBr2. Iodides are preferred to bromides.Lithium iodide and sodium iodide are iodides used by preference. The ratio of the number of gram atoms I plus Br to the number of gram atoms Ru plus Rh preferably lies between 3 1 and 200 1, in particular between 4 1 and 150 1. It is further an essential characteristic of the process of the invention that a nitrogen compound of one of the types indicated hereinbefore is present in the reaction mixture. As distinct from the amines used in the examples of US patent specification No.4,301,312, trimethylamine and N methylpyrrolidine, these nitrogen compounds are weak bases. Strong nitrogen bases act very unfavourably in the process according to the invention. The aromatic heterocyclic amine which can be used according to the invention preferably contains a heterocyclic six membered ring.Therefore preference is given to heterocyclic amines such for instance as pyridine, chinoline and isochinoline, which compounds may optionally contain one or more substituents, for instance hydrocarbyl groups, in particular alkyl groups having 1 6 carbon atoms or halogen atoms, and the oxides thereof. Pyridine and pyridine oxide are excellently suitable. Specific examples of suitable substituted aromatic heterocyclic amines are alpha , beta and gammapicoline, 4,4 trimethylenebipyridine, 2,2 bipyridine, 2 ethyl4 chloropyridine, 3,5 dimethylpyridine, 2 cyclohexylpyridine and chinaldine. The picolines and their oxides are preferred organic nitrogen compounds with a substituted aromatic heterocyclic ring.The organic nitrogen compound containing a groupEMI6.1 may be an amide, a carbamate, urea or a urea derivative. Suitable amides have the formula EMI6.2 wherein R represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkaryl orv aralkyl group preferably having not more than 10 carbon atoms, R1 and R2 independently represent a hydrogen atom or an alkyl, aryl, alkaryl or aralkyl group which may containEMI6.3 group and preferably has not more than 10 carbon atoms, or R1 and R2, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bound, form a cyclic group which preferably has not more than 5 carbon atoms and which may contain one or more nitrogen or oxygen atoms, or one of the groups R1 and R2 together with the nitrogen atom and R, forms a cyclic group preferably having not more than 5 carbon atoms.Specific examples of such amides are formamide, acetamide,N methylacetamide, N ethylacetamide, N,N dimethylformamide, N,N diethylformamide, N,N dimethylacetamide, N,N diethylacetamide, N methylN ethylacetamide, N,N dimethylcyclohexylcarboxamide, N,N dimethylbenzamide, N phenylacetamide, N,N diphenylacetamide, N methyl Nphenylacetamide, N formylmorpholine, N acetylmorpholine, N formylpiperidine, N acetylpiperidine and N acetyl N methylpiperazine. Especially suitable amides are N,N dimethylacetamide and N methylpyrrolidone. Formula IX also includes diamides and triamides such as diacetamide, triacetamide, dibenzamide, tribenzamide and N methyldibenzamide, and imides such as succinimide, 1,2 cyclohexane dicarboximide and N phenylphthalimide. Suitable carbamates for instance have the formula EMI7.1 wherein R3 represents an alkyl, aryl, aralkyl or alkaryl group preferably having not more than 10 carbon atoms and R4 and R5 independently represent a hydrogen atom or an alkyl, aryl, aralkyl or alkaryl group preferably having not more than 10 carbon atoms.Specific examples of such carbamates are methyl carbamate, ethyl carbamate, phenyl carbamate, N methylmethyl carbamate, N ethylmethyl carbamate, N phenylmethyl carbamate, N methylethyl carbamate,N ethylethyl carbamate, N phenylethyl carbamate, N methylphenyl carbamate, N ethylphenyl carbamate, N phenylphenyl carbamate,N N dimethylmethyl carbamate, N,N diethylmethylethyl carbamate,N,N diphenylmethyl carbamate, N,N dimethylethyl carbamate, N,Ndiethylethyl carbamate, N,N diphenylethyl carbamate, N,N dimethylphenyl carbamate, N,N diethylphenyl carbamate, N diphenylphenyl carbamate, N methyl N ethylmethyl carbamate and N methyl N ethylethyl carbamate. Urea and its derivatives have the formula EMI7.2 wherein R6 and R7 independently represent a hydrogen atom or an alkyl, aryl, aralkyl or alkaryl group preferably having not more than 10 carbon atoms. Specific examples of such compounds are urea, 1,3 dimethylurea, 1,3 diethylurea, 1,3 diphenylurea, l,l dimethylurea, l,l diphenylurea and 1,1,3,3, tetramethylurea. The ratio of the number of moles of the aromatic heterocyclic amine, the oxide thereof or the organic nitrogen compound containing a groupEMI7.3 to the number of gram atoms Ru Rh generally lies between 5 1 and 200 1. In the case of the organic nitrogen compounds containing a groupEMI7.4 this ratio preferably lies between 30 1 and 200 1 and in the case of the aromatic hetero cyclic amines and the oxides thereof this ratio preferably lies between 5 1 and 50 1. However, the use of higher or lower ratios is not precluded. The process of the invention is preferably carried out at a temperature between 150 and 2500C, in particular between 160 and 220it. The overall pressure preferably lies between 40 and 100 bar.Higher pressures, for instance of up to 1000bar, may be used if desired, but generally they are undesirable for technical and economic reasons. The carbon monoxide or the mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen may optionally be mixed with other gases such for instance as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen or noble gases. If a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen is used, the carbon monoxide to hydrogen molar ratio preferably is at least 1 1, in particular at least 2 1. The process of the invention may be carried out under anhydrous conditions. However, since any water present or formed is converted into CO2 and H2 by reaction with carbon monoxide according to reaction equation V, there will be no problem if the starting materials contain some water, for instance in the form of crystal water. When, for instance, a carbon monoxide feed with a high CO content and a low hydrogen content is available, it may even be advantageous to add some water to the reaction mixture in the course of the reaction in order to stimulate the formation of hydrogen in situ. When water is added continuously it will of course be possible that the reaction mixture is not entirely anhydrous. Addition of water on the other hand leads to a reduction in the formation of methane. The reaction may optionally be carried out in the presence of a promoter. Suitable promoters are for instance the oxides of secondary and tertiary phosphines. Examples of suitable phosphine oxides are trimethylphosphine oxide, diethylphosphine oxide, tri nbutylphosphine oxide, trioctylphosphine oxide, diphenylphosphine oxide, tri p tolylphosphine oxide, tricyclohexylphosphine oxide, diphenylethylphosphine oxide, tri l naphthyl phosphine oxide and tri 4 chlorophenylphosphine oxide. The phosphorus atom of the phosphine oxide may also be part of a heterocyclic system such for instance as in l phenylphospholane oxide, 1 phenylphosphorinane oxide and 9 phenyl 9 phosphabicyclo 3 3 l nonane oxide. Oxides of phosphines containing two or more phosphine groups, such for instance as tetraphenyldiphosphine ethane, can also be used.Preference is given to phosphine oxides of the formula R8P 0, wherein 3 the groups R8 independently represent alkyl groups of 1 12 carbon atoms or phenyl groups optionally substituted with methyl or ethyl groups. The amounts of phosphine oxide may vary within wide ranges. Suitable quantities lie, for instance, between 1 and 100 mol per gram atom Ru plus Rh, but larger or smaller quantities may also be used. Another group of promoters are basic compounds of alkali or alkaline earth metals such for instance as the oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, bicarbonates, formates, acetates, and alcoholates of lithium, sodium, potassium, cesium, magnesium, calcium and barium. The process is carried out in the liquid phase. Generally there is no need to use an additional solvent since methanol, the nitrogen compound and the products formed act sufficiently as solvents. If desired, additional solvents may be used however, tetrahydrothiophene l,l dioxide, also referred to as sulpholane , for instance. The process can be carried out continuously, semi continuously or batch wise. The reaction mixture obtained can be processed by known techniques, such for instance as fractional distillation. The process may further be integrated in existing processes for preparing the starting materials or working up the products obtained.Example I Into a magnetically stirred 125 ml Hastelloy C autoclave Hastelloy is a trade mark were placed 0.62 mol methanol 25 ml , 9.5 mmol RuC13.3H20, 0.25 mmol RhC13.3H20, 60 mmol LiI.2H20 and 12 mmol pyridine.

The autoclave was flushed with carbon monoxide, filled up with a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen of molar ratio of 2 1 and an overal pressure of 60 bar, and then heated to a temperature of 1900C. During the reaction a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen was introduced into the autoclave at a rate of 9 Nl h, stripping volatile components from the reaction mixture. These components were passed through a pressure valve into a condensation unit. The e overall pressure in the autoclave was kept at 60 bar.To the mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen to be introduced methanol was continuously added at a rate of 0.4 ml h.The total reaction time was 15 hours.

The autoclave was flushed with carbon monoxide, filled with a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen of molar ratios as given in Table B, and heated to a temperature of l900C. During the reactions mixtures of carbon monoxide and hydrogen were introduced into the autoclave at a rate of 9 Nl h for the periods of time and in the molar ratios given inTable B, stripping volatile components from the reaction mixture.These components were passed through a pressure valve into a condensation unit. The overall pressure in the autoclave was kept at 60 bar, the temperature at 1900C and the total reaction time at 15 hours. After termination of the reaction the contents both of the autoclave and of the condensation unit were analysed by gas liquid chromatography. At each hour of the experiment samples were taken of the effluent gas stream and analysed by gas chromatography for the presence of CO, H2, CH4 and C02. Methanol conversion and selectivities to the formation of ethanol, ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, acetic acid and methane are given in Table B. The reaction mixture obtained was anhydrous. In Table C a number of comparative experiments are listed which were carried out in the same way as those of Table B. The experiments show that when an alkali metal acetate is used instead of an alkali metal iodide, or when the latter compound is omitted, the catalyst system practically loses its activity. This is also the case when instead of a weak basic reacting nitrogen compound a strong basic reacting compound is used, such as N methylpiperidine. The use of triphenylphosphine as promoter also leads to deactivation of the catalyst system. The use of methyl iodide instead of an alkali metal iodide results only in the formation of acetic acid. When the ruthenium compound is omitted from the catalyst system, practically only acetic acid and methyl acetate and no ethanol or ethyl acetate are formed.In the last two experiments in contrast to the experi ments described in Table B and the other examples no carbon dioxide was present in the gas mixture leaving the reactor, and the reaction mixture obtained was not anhydrous.Example V An experiment was carried out in the way described in ExampleIV using pure carbon monoxide instead of a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. In the autoclave were 0.62 mol methanol 25 ml , O.S mmol RhCl3.3H20, 0.5 mmol RuC13.3H20, 40 mmol Lil.2H20 and 156 mmol Nmethylpyrrolidone. The temperature was 1900G and the pressure was kept at 60 bar. Throughout the reaction period 15 hours carbon monoxide was passed through the autoclave at a rate of 9 Nl h.Conversion was 100 Z.
