# Electrical generator utilizing magnetized particles.

## Abstract
An electrical particle generator comprising a non magnetic pipe in a closed loop having a substantial amount of magnetized particles encapsulated therein. A magnetic accelerator assembly positioned on said pipe having an inductive primary winding and a low voltage input to said winding. A secondary winding positioned on said pipe opposite to said primary winding. Upon voltage being applied to said primary winding said magnetized particles are passed through said magnetic accelerator assembly with increased velocity. The velocity accelerated particles continuing through said pipe induce an electrical voltage current potential as they pass through the secondary winding. The increased secondary voltage is utilized in an amplifier arrangement.
