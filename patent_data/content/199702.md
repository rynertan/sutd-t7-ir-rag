## Description
AMINE DEALKYLATION PROCESS The present invention relates to a process for dealkylating a substituted amine and is useful in the preparation of a wide variety of amine containing chemicals. In the synthesis of many useful chemical compounds comprising amine groups it is sometimes necessary to protect the amine group from reaction with another functional group in the molecule, or from reaction with a chemical effecting modification of another part of the molecule. This can often be done by preparing a derivative of the amine group from which the original amine group may readily be regenerated. Protection of an amine group in this way has in the past been done by formation of carbamates, amides, imines, enamines and N hetero atom derivatives. Another method of amine group protection that is particularly relevant to the present invention is the use of an alkyl group. However the essence oft protection is that the group can be readily removed.While aralkyl groups with the aryl group a to the nitrogen can be removed by reductive processes, it has been the view that alkyl groups need to contain another functional group to facilitate cleavage of the N C bond. This subject is fully discussed in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis byT. W. Greene Wiley Sons, 1981 . Amino group protection is discussed in Chapter 7. Protection of a primary or secondary amine group using an alkyl group is usually very effective since the alkyl group is, generally speaking, quite inactive in most organic reactions. It is also however quite difficult to remove for essentially the same reason. A process has now been discovered by which substituted or unsubstituted alkyl groups can be removed from secondary or tertiary amines to yield the corresponding primary or secondary amine respectively. Of course the dealkylation process of the present invention is useful not only in the context of the removal of an alkyl amine protecting group but also in the synthesis of selected primary or secondary amines in which the precursor compound is one containing an alkyl substituted amine group DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a dealkylation process for the production of primary or secondary amines which comprises reacting, at a temperature from 2500C to 4000C, an amine having the formula EMI2.1 wherein R1 is selected from groups containing an acid function promoting solubility of the amine in aqueous alkaline solution and containing at least one acidic OH group R2 is hydrogen, methyl, benzyl, R1 or R3, provided that if either of R1 and R2 is CH2COOH the other may not be CH2PO3H2 and R3 is selected from groups having the formula EMI2.2 wherein R4, R5 are each individually hydrogen, C1 C6 alkyl, aryl or substituted aryl R6 and R7 are, independently selected from, R4, R5, hydroxy, C1 C6 alkoxy, aryloxy, halogen, SH, C1 C6 thioalkyl, NHR8, and NR82 where each R8 is a C1 to C6 alkyl group or, where R6 is H, R7 can be a group with the formula N CCH2COOH 2 or R3 and R2 together with the nitrogen can form a heterocyclic group with an alkali in aqueous solution in at least the stoichiometric amount of alkali needed to neutralize any acid groups present in the amine, so as to produce a compound in which the R3 group has been replaced by hydrogen. The reaction according to the invention can be represented diagrammatically as follows EMI3.1 SEP z SEP N SEP Heat tb R1 N R3 SEP .X M SEP OH SEP SEP SEP H N R1 tb SEP R2 tb where M is an alkali metal and X is at least the number of free acid groups in the amine so as to ensure that the reaction occurs in alkaline solution. Usually from 1 to 6 moles of alkali for each acidic group in the amine are used. In preferred reactions this ratio is from 3 2 to 3 1. The group R3 is essentially an alkyl group containing at least one hydrogen on the ss carbon atom.The group may, if desired, be substituted by the various groups specified above. These are groups that do not interfere with, or generate competing reactions to, the dealkylation process of the invention. The group split off R3 is usually released in the form of an alkene. In the case of the simplest R3 groups such as ethyl, propyl and isopropyl, the alkenes formed are gases, and thus cause no separation problems during product isolation. Since the reaction takes place in aqueous solution it is essential that at least one of the groups R1 or R2 in the reaction material provides acidic OH groups that either themselves render the amine water soluble or produce a water soluble derivative in the presence of the alkali reactant. Suitable groups that can be represented by R1 include for example EMI4.1 The reaction temperature is between 2500C and 4000C and since the reaction occurs in aqueous solution this implies that the reaction occurs in an autoclave capable of withstanding the autogenous pressures generated by the aqueous reaction mixtures at these temperatures. The alkali most commonly used is sodium hydroxide but the readily available potassium hydroxide can also be used if desired. The other alkali metal hydroxides can be used but are not generally preferred either because of cost or general effectiveness. SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The process of the invention is particularly useful for the preparation of amino acids from theirN alkyl derivatives. Particularly valuable amino acids because of their utility as intermediates in the production of a range of agricultural and pharmaceutical chemicals include glycine, sarcosine and iminodiacetic acid IDA . The following chart gives the results of a.number of reactions according to the invention resulting in the production of the amino acid indicated. In each case the reaction temperature was 300QC and the alkali was sodium hydroxide.

The following are specific detailed Examplesof the process of the invention. It is not however intended that the following Examples imply any limita tion on the essential scope of the invention. EXAMPLE 1 A 100 ml Monel autoclave was charged with 5.0g 0.038 mol of N isopropyl N methylglycine, 6.0g 0.076 mol of 50 ,NaOH solution, and 9 ml of water to give a solution. The vessel was closed and the head space flushed for several minutes with 2 The reactor was then sealed and heated to iO0 C over a one hour period. As Ã…a consequence of this temperature, an internal pressure of 6.1x106 N M2 hdd developed.While the reaction temperature was maintained at 3000C for six hours, the pressure rosesto 7.0x106N M2 as a consequence of propene being liberated confirmation of propene was obtained by mass spectral analysis of the head space gases . After the heating period, the reactor was cooled, excess pressure was released,, and the reaction mixture was diluted with water. An analytical sample was examined by HPLC which determined the yield of sarcosine to be 2.38g 71 . The reaction mixture was neutralized by addition of 6.3 ml .of concentratedHCl and purified by ion exchange chromatography Amberlite CG 50 resin to yield 51 of the theoretical amount of sarcosine. EXAMPLE 2 A 100 ml Monel autoclave was charged with 4.27g 24.4 mmol of N isopropyliminodiacetic acid, 5.8g 73 mmol of a 50 NaOH solution, and 12 ml of water to give a solution. The reactor was closed and the head space was flushed with N2 before sealing the vessel and heating it to 300 C. When the vessel reached 3000C, an internal pressure of 5.82x106 N M2 had developed. During the three hour heating time at 3000C the pressure rose to 6.31x106 No12. When the reactor cooled, excess pressure was vented and the reaction mixture was neutralized with 73 mmol of ETC1. A solution of the final product was analyzed byHPLC and was determined to contain 2.07g 64 of iminodiacetic acid and 0.66g 16 of the starting substrate. EXAMPLE 3 A 100 ml Nonel autoclave was charged with 7.15g 40.3 mmol of N 2 hydroxyethyl iminodiacetic acid, 9. 121 mmol of a 50 NaOH solution, and 12 ml of water to give a solution. The head space of the reactor was flushed with N2, sealed, and then the vessel was heated to 3000C. When the reactor reached this temperature an internal pressure of 5.82x106 N M2 had developed. During the course of heating at 3000C for three hours, the pressure rose to 7.55x106 N M2. The reactor was allowed to cool, excess pressure was released, and the reaction mixture was diluted with 10 ml of water.The reaction was neutralized by the addition of 10 ml of concentrated HCl. HPLC of the final solution indicated a total of 4.31g 80.4 of iminodiacetic acid had been prepared. EXAMPLE 4 To a 100 ml Monel autoclave was added 2.71g 16.2 mmol of N,N diethylaminomethylphosphonic acid 6.45g 81 mmol of a 50 NaOH solution, and 10 ml of water to give a solution. The head space of the reactor was flushed with N2 for several minutes. The reactor was then sealed and heated to 3250C over the course of an hour. At this temperature an internal pressure of 4.65x106 N M2 had developed. The reaction was maintained at 3000C for five hours during which time the pressure in the vessel increased to approximately 7.69x106 N M2. After cooling the vessel and releasing excess pressure, the reaction mixture was diluted with 10 ml of water, neutralized with 6.6 ml of concentrated HC1, and evaporated to dryness. .This residue was taken up in concentrated HCl and WaCl was filtered off.The filtrate was evaporated to leave an oil which was purified by ion exchange chromatography Dowex 50x8 400 . Only one major peak was isolated 1.43g . By NMR this was determined to consist of 1.38g 76.6 of aminomethylphosphonic acid and 0.05g 2.2 of N ethyl aminomethylphosphonic acid. EXAMPLE S To a 100 ml Monel autoclave was added 3.16g 16.2 mmol of N,N diisopropylaminomethylphosphonic acid, 6.48g 81 mmol of a 50 NaOH solution, and 10 ml of water to give a solution. The head space of the vessel was flushed with N2 for several minutes and then the reactor was sealed. The vessel was heated to 3250C over the course of 50 minutes and held at that temperature for only 25 additional minutes. During the period at 3250C the internal pressure of the reactor rose from 6.58x106 to 6.80x106 N M2. The system was allowed to cool, excess pressure was released, and the reaction mixture was diluted with water. The solution was neutralized with 6.7 ml of concentrated HC1 and evaporated to dryness. The residue was taken up in concentrated HC1 and NaCl was filtered off. The filtrate was evaporated to an oil and purified by ion exchange chromatography Dowex ,50x8 400 to give only one major peak 2.4g . By NMR this material was determined to consist of 2.25g 90.6 of N isopropylaminomethylphosphonic acid and 0.15g 8.4 of aminomethylphosphonic acid. The amino acids produced by the process of the invention are useful intermediates in the production of a wide range of chemicals with therapeutic or phytotoxic applications. For example both iminodiacetic acid and aminomethylphosphonic acid can each be used as a starting material in different processes of course for the production of N phosphonomethylglycine, the active ingredient in an extremely effective systemic contact herbicide.
