## Description
Cathode ray tube. The invention relates to a picture display cathode ray tube provided with a luminescent screen comprising a luminescent indium borate activated by a lanthanide element. Such a tube is known from US PS 3,394,084.This Patent Specification describes luminescent indium borates fundamental lattice Ins03 which are activated by a lanthanide element, the activator replacing part of the indium in the fundamental lattice. Materials suitable for practical applications are the borates activated by trivalent terbium which exhibit a green emission having, as appears from measurements, CIE colour co ordinates x 0.330 and y 0.620 and the borates activated by trivalent europium which exhibit a red emission having colour co ordinates x 0.605 and y 0.395, which materials have a high brightness. The known luminescent indium borates have a decay of the order of 20 msec medium decay . The decay is defined as the time which elapses after the excitation by the electron beam has ceased till the instant at which the brightness has reached a value of 10 of the brightness in the stationary state. Due to their suitable emission colour, their favourable brightness value, their medium decay character and the substantially complete absence of phosphorescence prolonged afterglow at a low brightness level , the known borates are particularly suitable for use in data display cathode ray tubes, the so called DGD Data Graphics Display tubes. In such tubes, picture repetition frequencies of 25 100 Hz are used in practice.If these tubes were provided with luminescent materials having a short decay, very annoying brightness variations or flicker phenomena, which are very fatiguing for the user, may be observed. With the use of materials having a long decay and or with phosphorescence phenomena, the tube exhibits in the succession of pictures a disturbing afterglow of the preceding pictures. It is very desirable for display tubes that a number of different colours are available. Essentially, it is possible to use the aforementioned green emitting and red emitting indium borates in mixtures, as a result of which all the mixed colours between green and red can be obtained. Other colours can then be obtained by adding a third material, for example a blue luminescing material.The use of mixtures of two and more particularly of three luminescent materials meets with practical difficulties, however, in the manufacture of the tubes because it is mostly inevitable that colour differences are obtained across the picture screen due to demixing of the luminescent materials. The invention has for its object to provide cathode ray tubes which display pictures of a colour chosen from a large colour range. A picture display cathode ray tube according to the invention is provided with a luminescent screen which contains an indium borate activated by a lanthanide element and it is characterized in that the indium borate contains as activator trivalent terbium and trivalent europium and corresponds to the formula In1 p qTbpEuqBO3, in which 50.10 p C 0.010 and 50.10 6 q C 0.010. A cathode ray tube according to the invention contains a luminescent indium borate which is activated both by Tb and by Eu. Consequently, like with physical mixtures of Tb activated borate and Eu activated borate, all the mixed colours between the green Tb emission and the red Eu emission can be obtained by a suitable adjustment of the activator concentrations. It could not at all be expected that high brightnesses can be obtained with borates twice activated. In fact, it is generally known that two activators, such as Tb3 and Eu3 , when used in one lattice, very strongly extinguish mutually theirrespective emissions see, for example, British Patent Specification 1,121,055, in which this phenomenon is described for luminescent yttrium or rare earth metal oxysulphides .Experiments leading to the invention have shown, however, that with the indium borates according to the invention brightnesses can be obtained which are substantially equal to those obtained with physical mixtures of borates. It has been found that it is then required that the concentrations of the activator elements have to be low to very low, that is to say that both the Tb concentration P and the Eu concentration q must be at most 0.010. It is also a surprise that even with very low values of p and q down to 50.10 , high brightnesses can still be obtained. The optimum values of p and g as to the brightness lie a factor 10 to 100 lower than the optimum values of the activator concentration in the known borates activated by one lanthanide element. The luminescent indium borates in cathode ray tubes according to the invention are found to have, like the known borates,a medium decay character decay of the order of 20 msec and to exhibit substantially no phosphorescence.With these borates, a number of yellow and orange emission colours can be obtained, which are very desirable for practical applications and which could be obtained hitherto only with mixtures of luminescent materials or with materials having an unsatisfactory decay or having other disadvantages. A cathode ray tube according to the invention is preferred, which is characterized in that 0.0001 p 0.010 0.0001 q 0.010 and p q c o.olO With these comparatively low values of the concentrations and q and of the overall concentration p q, in fact the highest brightnesses are obtained. The emission colour of a luminescent indium borate in a cathode ray tube according to the invention can be characterized by only the x co ordinate or only the y co ordinate in the CIE colour point diagram because the colour points of these borates are all located on or very close to the connection line of the colour points of the pure green Tb emission x 0.330 and y 0.620 and the pure red Eu emission x 0.605 and y 0.395 . Hereinafter the colour point of the borates is indicated only by the x co ordinate. As could be expected, the Tb Eu ratio p q determines the location of the colour point of the luminescent borates. However, it has been found that also the overall activator concentration, p q, has a very strong influence and also determines the colour point. This in fluece becomes manifest in an increase of the x co ordinate of the colour point with an increase of p q if p q is kept constant. It has been found, for example, that at a value of p q 1 the x co ordinate of the colour point can have values of from approximately 0.450 with a very low p q to approximately 0.575 with a comparatively high p q. It has been found that the brightness of the borates at comparatively high values of p q is not an optimum. An embodiment of a cathode ray tube according to the invention is characterized in that the borate emits light having a colour coordinate x between 0.410 and 0.450 and that 1 p q t 5 and preferably 1 C p q 4 3. Such a tube has a yellow emission colour which is often desirable for practical applications target x 0.425, y 0.550 . The yellow colours infflhe said range of x co ordinates can be obtained with p q values in the range of from 1 to 5.However, p q values of from 1 to 3 are preferred because in this case overall concentrations p q can be chosen which give rise to optimum brightnesses of the tubes. A second embodiment of a cathode ray tube according to the invention is characterized in that the borate emits light having a colour co ordinate x between 0.450 and 0.520 and in that 0.54 p q C 3 and preferably 0.5 pXq 4 1.5. With this tube, also yellow colours can be obtained which are frequently used in practice target x z 0.470, y 0.500 . Again it has been found that the p q value can be chosen in a comparatively large range, i.e. of from 0.5 to 3, but that values in a smaller range, i.e. from 0.5 to 1.5, are preferred in order to obtain the highest brightnesses. Frequently used colours in display tubes are the orange red colours having colour points if, for example x 0.547, y z 0.446 and x 0.557, y 0.442.An advantageous embodiment of a cathode ray tube according to the invention is therefore characterized in that the borate emits light having a colour co ordinate x between 0.520 and 0.570 and in that 0.10 pq 4 1.5 and preferably 0.104 p q t 0.5. In a cathode ray tube according to the invention, the luminescent screen can further contain at least one additional luminescent material. This of course has the advantage that a larger range of emission colours becomes possible. A very favourable embodiment of a cathode ray tube according to the invention is characterized in that the luminescent screen contains from 5 to 35 ffi by weight of a blue luminescing silver activated zinc sulphide. If such a generally known blue luminescing sulphide is provided in the luminescent screen together with, for example, a yellow luminescing borate, for example, in the form of a mixture, a white emission colour paper white can be obtained, which is very desirable for many applications. The luminescent indium borates can be obtained by a solid state reaction at a high temperature of mixtures of oxides of the constituent elements or of compounds yielding these oxides at high temperature. The reaction generally takes plave in air at a temperature of 1100 14000C. Embodiments of cathode ray tubes according to the invention will now be described more fully with reference to a drawing and a number of examples and measurements. The drawing shows diagrammatically and partly in sectional view a data display cathode ray tube DGD tube .The tube comprises an evacuated envelope 1 provided with a picture screen 2 on which a luminescent screen 3 is disposed.The screen 3 is provided with a luminescent indium borate activated by terbium and europium. Example of preparation.There are dissolved in 600 ml of concentrated HN0 200 g of In metal 0.195 g of Tb407 0.18 g of Eu203.The solution is evaporated to dryness at a temperature of 200 300 C and the dry product obtained is mixed with 430 g of H3BO3. The mixture is heated in a furnace in air at a temperature of 1200 C for 15 35 hours. The reaction product is washed with boiling water, after which it is dried, pulverized and sieved. The powder obtained is a luminescent indium borate according to the formulaIn0.9988Tb0.0006Eu0.0006BO3. Upon cathode ray exitation this borate is found to have a yellow emission colour with x 0.470 and y 0.500. The brightness is found to be 38 in relative units. The brightness of P22, a greenluminescing zinc cadmium sulphide activated by Cu and Al, is used as a standard and assumed to be 100 .It has been found that comparable results are obtained if there is started from dry mixtures of indium oxide, the activator oxides and H3B03. In the same manner as indicated in the above example of preparation, a number of indium borates were obtained in which the concentrations of terbium and europium were equal p q and p q 1 . In the followingTable 1, the chosen value for p is given for these materials.Furthermore, the x coordinate of the colour point for each material is stated and the relative brightness H is indicated which is obtained when the material is excited by cathode rays.

At the maximum permissible value of p q p q 0.02 in Example 6 an acceptable value of the brightness is still found.The optimum brightnesses are obtained, however, at much lower values of the concentrations p and q. It should be noted for explanation that a borate analogous to the borates of Examples 1 to 6, but with p 0.025 and q 0.025 usual values of the activator concentration of optimum luminescent borates containing only one activator , has a colour point x 0.588 and a brightness of only 8, so that this material is not suitable for practical applications. In the same manner as in the Example of preparation preparation, luminescent indium borates were prepared having yellow emission colours in the range x 0.410 to x 0.450.Table 2 indicates for each material the chosen value of p and q and the value p q.
