# Optical data storage.

## Abstract
A thermoplastics data storage member 1 carrying information 5 which can be imaged, using non coherent light, and, in addition to and distinct from that information, control data 7, 8, 9 which define the first co ordinate of a two coordinate system for the member 1 . The second coordinate is defined by the processing apparatus itself, independent of the storage member 1 . A reading apparatus comprises a non laser optical system for imging selected areas of the information, and a servo system, including a micro processor and transducers for reading the control data and for positioning a reading head of the optical system in desired locations relative to the storage member.
