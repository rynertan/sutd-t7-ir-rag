# A photographic element exhibiting reduced sensitizing dye stain.

## Abstract
A spectrally sensitized silver halide photographic ele ment capable of producing a stable, viewable silver image on development and fixing out is disclosed. The latent image forming silver halide grains in the image recording emulsion layer or layers of the photographic element are silver bromide, chloride, or chlorobromide grains. At least one of the image recording emulsion layers contains spectrally sensitized tabular grains. Located in proximity to the spec trally sensitized tabular grains are relatively fine high iodide silver halide grains capable of being dissolved during fixing out.
