# Neutron absorbing article.

## Abstract
A neutron absorbing article, preferably in flat plate form and suitable for use in a storage rack for spent nuclear fuel, includes boron carbide particles, diluent particles and a solid, irreversibly cured phenolic polymer cured to a continuous matrix about the boron carbide and diluent particles. The total content of boron carbide and diluent particles is a major proportion of the article and the content of cured phenolic polymer present is a minor proportion. By regulation of the ratio of boron carbide particles to diluent particles, normally within the range of 1 9 to 9 1 and preferably within the range of 1 5 to 5 1, the neutron absorbing activity of the product may be controlled, which facilitates the manufacture of articles of particular absorbing activities best suitable for specific applications.
