# Apparatus for extracting soluble constituents from cut plant material.

## Abstract
Apparatus for extracting soluble constituents from cut plant material, particularly tobacco, comprises a conduit 4 having a depressed central pipe portion 24 and end portions 1, 2 rising towards respective ends 10, 20 . A screw conveyor 7, 8, 9 extends along the interior of the conduit and has a conveying action on the plant material only. At the material output end of the conduit are a plant material discharge 22, 23 and a liquid inlet 21 and at the material input end 10 are a plant material input 15 and a liquid overflow 16, 17, 18 . The overflow establishes a liquid level 19 which is above the complete cross section of the central pipe portion 24 but below the two ends 10, 20 .
