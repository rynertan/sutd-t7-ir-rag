# MODIFIED POLYOLEFIN AND PROCEDURE FOR ITS MANUFACTURE, AND ITS USE

## Abstract
A modified polyolefin contains 1 to 99 polyolefin, mixed polymer or mixture of polyolefin and 99 to 1 polyvinylalcohol or its mixed polymer, and aforementioned polyolefin compo nent and polyvinylalcohol component are partly or totally chemically bound to each other. To the polyolefin chain there is copolymerized, grafted or otherwise chemically joined a chemical compound which reacts chemically with polyvinylal cohol. The chemical compound joined to the polyolefin chain is suitably a silane or alkoxysilane.
