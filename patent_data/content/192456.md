# Semiconductor integrated circuit.

## Abstract
In a semiconductor integrated circuit 10 comprising an internal circuit 9 , an oscillating circuit 1 generating a basic clock signal for operating the internal circuit 9 when the internal circuit is operated in a usual mode, a pair of terminals Toscin, Toscout connected to the input side and output side of the oscillating circuit 1 , respectively, an oscillator 8 being connected between the above pair of terminals Toscin, Toscout when the internal circuit 9 is operated in a usual mode, a reset terminal Treset through which a reset signal for resetting the internal circuit is supplied from outside the integrated circuit 10 to the internal circuit, and a test circuit 3, 4, 5 for operating the internal circuit 9 in a test mode the test circuit supplies a clock signal for testing from outside the integrated circuit to the internal circuit 9 through one of the above pair of terminals Toscout when signals of a predetermined level are supplied from outside of the chip to the test circuit through each of the other one of the above pair of terminals Toscin and the reset terminal Treset .
