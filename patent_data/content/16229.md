# IRREGULAR WEAR PROOF RADIAL PLY TIRE.

## Abstract
An irregular wear proof radial ply tire is, for eliminating the irregular wearing at its shoulder portions, provided with a tread 5 comprising central portions 7 7 each limited in a zone defined by W 2 0.365H wherein W is a width, H is a height of the tire under its nominal inflation pressure from the center line 1 of the tire, and shoulder portions 8 8 which are each jointed to its associated central portion and liable to be subjected to the irregular wearing, said shoulder portions are formed with thick gum portions 9 9 which are gradually thickened toward the shoulder edges. A mold M for fabricating the tire of this kind is provided with a tread forming inner wall portion 5M which is composed of two curved surfaces, one of which is a central zone forming por tion 7M and another of which is a shoulder forming portion 8M , the radius of the latter being larger than that of the former. A distance d between two curved surfaces each described along the radii, at the point of W 2 0.2H wherein W and H are the same as above apart from the center line 1M of the mold, is defined by 0.4 x 10 2H d 1.5 x 10 2H wherein H is the same as above . The central portion 7 may be provided with continuous grooves extended along its circumferential direction.
