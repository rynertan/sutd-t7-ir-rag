# SYSTEM FOR COUPLING A VISUAL SENSOR PROCESSOR AND A ROBOT CONTROLLER.

## Abstract
A system for coupling a visual sensor processor B and a robot controller A, in order to inexpensively constitute the whole system while maintaining increased processing speed. For this purpose, the visual sensor processor B and the robot controller A are couplped together through bidirectional high speed data transfer channels 10, 28, ℓ1, ℓ2 , so that the data required for the two apparatuses can be exchanged through these channels. Utilizing these channels, furthermore, a non volatile memory 6 and serial interface 12 for connection to an external input output device, installed in the robot controller A, are commonly used for these two apparatuses.
