# Human monoclonal antibodies to cancer cells.

## Abstract
Human monoclonal antibody producing hybridoma cell lines of the present invention have been formed by fusing immortal cells from human or mouse sources with lymphocytes from individuals having renal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer or lymphoproliferative disease. The HmAb produced by these hybridomas recognize cell surface and cytoplasmic components of human normal and malignant cells. Normal and cancerous human cells may be detected by immunoassay with the HmAb.
