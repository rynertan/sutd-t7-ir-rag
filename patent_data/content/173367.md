# Battery economising circuit.

## Abstract
A battery economising circuit for use with one or more operating circuits, for example a part or parts of a radio circuit, in which battery economising circuit an opposed current mirror type of current reference circuit 18 determines entirely the current consumed by the operating circuit 10 . A control circuit 22 is connected to a point in the reference circuit 18 from which current can be extracted. The control circuit 22 in response to an OFF signal causes a portion of the current in the reference circuit 18 to be diverted so that the reference circuit 18 cannot sustain its normal ON state and in response thereto assumes its OFF state in which the operating and control circuits 10, 22 do not take current. The control circuit 22 further includes means whereby current can be injected into the current reference circuit 18 to cause it to assume its ON state and in consequence the operating circuit 10 takes current. In the case of there being several current reference circuits 18, 18 and associated control circuits 22, 22 , the inputs 24, 24 of the control circuits 22, 22 are all connected to a common signalling bus 26 .
