# Robotic hand and method for manipulating printed circuit boards.

## Abstract
Three sets of pincer units 16 18 depend from a flat palm 12 , each pincer unit having a pinching gap 43 at its distal end for engaging a loaded circuit board 33 by its edges and holding it in a spaced apart relationship with the palm. Each pincer unit includes a finger 39 having a flange 41 at its distal end and a thumb 38 slideably mounted on the finger so as to define a variable pinching gap. The fingers are mounted for prehensiling movement away from one another for bracketing a board to be picked up and toward one another so that the board to be picked up may be squeezed between them. The invention includes a method for picking up a loaded circuit board which involves bracketing a board to be picked up between a set of pincer units, squeezing the board by moving the pincer units toward one another against oppos ing edges of the board while simultaneously pinching each edge engaged with the pincer units.
