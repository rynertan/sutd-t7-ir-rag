# Vapor drying apparatus.

## Abstract
A vapor drying apparatus for semiconductor wafers, which is capable of preventing dust particles from entering the interior of the vapor drying apparatus incorporating therein a water washing part 200 and a vapor drying part 300 for a semiconductor wafer 19 and, at the same time, thoroughly removing from the surface of a vapor dried semi conductor wafer 19 the vapor cleaner 320 adhering in the form of film or in a molecular thickness to the surface or an organic substance contained in the cleaner thereby bringing the surface of the semiconductor wafer 19 to an ideally cleaned and dried state.
