# Electrical connector for flat cable.

## Abstract
An electrical connector for use in establishing electri cal connections to the conductors of a flat cable compris es a first housing member 1 carrying a plurality of ter minals 2 each having a conductor receiving portion 4 comprising a pair of spaced arms 5 extending normally of the one face of the first housing member 1 , the arms hav ing opposed edges defining a conductor receiving slot 6 and having pointed extremities for piercing the insulating material 102 of the cable, and a second housing member 7 having a plurality of holes 8 extending inwardly from one face thereof each to receive the arms 5 of a respec tive one of the terminals 2 carried by the first housing member 1 , the arms 5 of the conductor receiving por tion 4 of each terminal 2 being formed adjacent their free ends with outwardly directed projections 9 which are an interference fit in the associated hole 8 in the second housing member 7 , and each arm 5 of each terminal 2 in use engaging the second housing member 7 , not only at the projection 9 on the arm but also at a second posi tion Y adjacent the engagement between the arm 5 and a conductor 101 of the cable received in the slot 6 par tially defined by the arm, thereby to ensure reliable con nection between the terminal 2 and the associated con ductor 101 . The connector of this invention has the advantage that the second position of engagement Y between each arm 5 of each terminal 2 and the second housing mem ber 7 serves to relieve the stresses induced in the arms 5 by the engagement between the projections 9 on the arms and the second housing member 7 , this enhancing the contact between the arms 5 and the conductors 101 and ensuring reliable electrical connections.
