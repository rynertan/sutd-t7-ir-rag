## Description
This invention relates to a new physiologically active substance, Plipastatin, which exhibits an enzyme inhibiting activity against phospholipase A₂, C and D and which is therefore useful as an immunosuppressive agent and as a type I anti allergic agent. Peptides having an acyl group are known and disclosed in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Published Patent Application Kokai Sho No. 59 95252. Adrenocortical steroids and cytotoxic immunosuppressors are already known as immunosuppressive agents. Also, antihistaminics have been used as an anti allergic agent. All of the conventional immunosuppressive agents however have strong toxicity against hematopoietic organs in humans, so there has been a continuous need for the development of immunosuppressive agents having low toxicity. Since the human immune system is extremely complicated, immunosuppressive agents exhibiting new mechanisms of action are strongly desired. Also, the development of new drugs against type I allergic disorders is desired because there is no conventional drug that is capable of satisfactory inhibition of type I allergic reaction. The present invention relates to a new physiologically active substance, Plipastatin, of the following general formula wherein R₁ is C₁₃H₂₇ or C₁₄H₂₉, R₂ is Ala or Val, and the abbreviations Glu, Orn, Tyr, Thr, Pro, Gln, Ile, Ala and Val respectively mean glutaminic acid, ornithine, tyrosine, threonine, proline, glutamine, isoleucine, alanine and valine. The present invention also relates to salts of Plipastatin and to a process for preparing Plipastatin. Plipastatin is useful as an immunosuppressive agent and an anti allergic agent having low toxicity and exhibiting a new mechanism of action. Plipastatin of the present invention includes the following four compounds. The compounds wherein R₂ in the formula I is Ala are hereunder referred to as Group A compounds and those wherein R₂ is Val, as Group B compounds The preparation of Plipastatin of the present invention is conducted by culturing a Plipastatin producing strain belonging to the genus The term Plipastatin producing strain used in the specification means those strains capable of producing at least one compound of the general formula I. Such strains include The mycological properties of the strain are described below. Mycological properties of the strain BMG302 fF67 FERM P No. 7843 The strain produces opaque colonies with an irregular periphery on the agar medium grows diffusively on the surface of the medium liquefies gelatin peptonizes milk reduces nitrate denitrification positive MR test negative VP test positive does not produce indole or hydrogen sulfide hydrolyzes starch utilizes citric acid urease reaction negative oxidase reaction negative catalase reaction negative grows in the range of 10 to 37 C optimum range 27 to 37 C at a pH between 5.0 and 9.0 optimum pH range 6.0 to 8.0 decomposes glucose fermentatively to form an acid produces acids from D glucose, D fructose and sucrose, in amounts that are positive to BTB indicator but negative to BCP indicator, but no gas evolves no acid and gas formation from L arabinose, D xylose, D mannose, D galactose, maltose, lactose, trehalose, D sorbitol, inositol, D mannitol, glycerose and starch and grows on the medium containing 7 NaCl. According to Bergey s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology , 8th edition R. E. Burhanan N. E. Gibbons, The Williams Wilkins Company, Baltimore, 1974 , these properties suggest that the strain BMG302 fF67 belongs to the genus As shown in the table, the strain BMG302 fF67 does not grow at 50 C. It is more similar to The method of the present invention is explained below in detail. For producing Plipastatin by the method of the present invention, the strain described above is first cultured aerobically on a medium containing nutrients available for bacteria. Conventional nutrients utilized for the cultivation of bacteria can be used as nutrient sources. For example, carbohydrates such as glycerin, glucose, lactose, sucrose, starch, maltose molasses, as well as fats may be used, singly or in combination, as carbon sources. Typical examples of inorganic and organic nitrogen sources which may be used include ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, urea, ammonium nitrate, sodium nitrate, peptone, meat extract, yeast extract, dry yeast, corn steep liquor, soybean meal, cotton seed oil cake, oatmeal, Casamino acid, Bactosoytone, soluble vegetable proteins, and mixtures thereof. If necessary, inorganic salts such as sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, copper sulfate, iron sulfate, zinc sulfate, manganese chloride, calcium carbonate and phosphates, as well as organic and inorganic substances capable of promoting the growth of the strain of the present invention and the formation of Plipastatin such as amino acids may be added. The preferred method of cultivation is a liquid culture, particularly a submerged culture. The cultivation is desirably carried out at a temperature of 25 to 30 C and at an approximately neutral pH. The physiologically active substance Plipastatin is produced and accumulated in a cultured broth by conducting the cultivation, usually for one or two days, by the liquid culture method. The cultivation is stopped when the amount of Plipastatin produced in the cultured broth reaches a maximum. The cells are filtered off and then the product of interest is isolated from the resulting filtrate and purified. The monitoring of the production of Plipastatin through the cultivation and purification steps is accomplished by measuring the antiphospholipase D activity in accordance with the following method. The measurement of the antiphospholipase D activity is carried out by the method of Okuyama et al. described in A. Okuyama, T. Nishikiori, T. Aoyagi and H. Umezawa, Biochemistry International, IC₅₀ values correspond to the concentration of the samples giving a 50 inhibition. The isolation and the purification of the product from the filtrate of the cultured broth may be performed by any conventional method used to isolate the metabolites of microorganisms from the filtrates of their cultured broth. Plipastatin is soluble in water, methanol, ethanol, and n propanol but insoluble or slightly soluble in usual organic solvents such as acetone. Thus, Plipastatin may be purified by any method that is used for purifying water soluble acidic substances. For example, adsorption onto and desorption from activated carbon powder or porous resins and column chromatography with silica gel, Silanised silica gel By way of example, the filtrate of the cultured broth of The isolation of each compound is performed as follows Also, Plipastatin Group B including B₁ and B₂ obtained by said column chromatography on silica gel is chromatographed on Silanised silica gel The respective compounds of the present invention so obtained were saponified with an alkali and subjected to mass spectrometry. The fragments of molecular ions appearing on the spectrum show that each of the compounds has the following amino acid sequence from N end Glu, Orn, Tyr, Thr, Glu, Ala, or Val , Pro, Gln, Tyr and Ile. Also, the existence of a lactone ring appearing on the IR spectrum shows that β hydroxy aliphatic acid is bonded to C end amino spectrum. On the basis of these data, the structures of the compounds of the present invention were identified as indicated above. The physicochemical properties of the compounds of the present invention are summarized in Table 1 below. All measurements were carried out using potassium salts of the compounds unless otherwise specified. The compounds of the present invention have relatively low toxicity. For example, the acute toxicity test in mice showed that LD₅₀ value of Plipastatin B₁ was in the range of 250 to 500 mg kg i.p. . This supports that Plipastatin of the present invention can suppress an immune response even if it is used alone. Thus, the compounds of the present invention will be useful as immunosuppressive drugs. The compounds of the present invention are commonly used as immunosuppressive drugs in the form of alkaline metal salts or other non toxic salts. The compounds of the present invention may be formulated and administered by conventional methods. They can be formulated into, for example, injections, powders, granules, tablets and suppositories. The route of administration of the compounds include, for example, parenteral, oral, and rectal. In the formulation procedures, any pharmaceutically carriers and other additives which do not affect the compounds of the present invention may be used. The amount of the active ingredient present in the formulation depends on the form of formulations, but generally ranges from 0.01 w w, hereunder the same to 100 , preferably, 0.1 to 70 . In the formulation procedures, any formulating aids which do not affect the compounds of the present invention, that is, carriers and other additives such as stabilizer, preservatives and analgesic agents may be used as required. The method of formulating injections is specifically described below. The compounds of the present invention and mannitol are dissolved into distilled water and the resulting solution is filled into vials or ampules for injections or freeze dried as such. Just prior to use, the freeze dried powder can be reconstituted with physiological saline or distilled water to form injections. The dose of the compounds of the present invention depends on such factors as the severity of the disease, but generally it is in the range of 0.01 to 2000 mg, preferably 0.1 to 1000 mg per day in an adult. Typical examples of formulations are described below. Thirty parts by weight of a potassium salt of Plipastatin B₁ is dissolved in 970 parts by weight of purified water and the resulting solution is sterilized by filtration through a millipore filter GS type. A 2 ml portion of the filtrate is charged into a 10 ml vial and freeze dried to obtain a freeze dried powder for injections. Fifty parts by weight of a potassium salt of Plipastatin A₁, 600 parts of lactose, 330 parts of crystalline cellulose and 20 parts of hydroxypropyl cellulose are well mixed and the resulting mixture is compressed by using a Roller compactor The physiological activities of the new physiological active substance, Plipastatin, of the present invention are explained below. The measurement of the inhibition of phospholipase was accomplished by the method of Okuyama et al. set forth above. The results are summarized in Table 2 below. As a result of studying the pharmacological effects of Plipastatin of the present invention, it was found that this substance has suppressive effects on cell mediated immunity. The suppressive effects on the cell mediated immunity of both Plipastatin A₁ and Plipastatin B₁ of the present invention are illustrated by the following experiments. This experiment illustrates the effects on the cell mediated immunity in normal mice. The activities of Plipastatin A₁ and B₁ on cell mediated immunity were studied in terms of delayed type hypersensitivity DTH caused by inoculating mice with antigenic sheep red blood cells SRBC in one footpad Reference J. Exp. Med., 139, 1529 1539, 1974 . CDF₁ mice female, 8 week of age were inoculated intravenously with a suspension of 5 x 10⁵ SRBC in physiological saline. At the same time, a single dose of an aqueous solution of 5 mg kg or 0.5 mg kg of Plipastatin A₁ or B₁ was administered intraperitoneally to the mice. Four days after the injection, the mice were subjected to the secondary challenge by subcutaneous injection of the other footpad with a suspension of 10⁸ SRBC in physiological saline. Twenty four hours later, the degree of footpad swelling increasing in the thickness of the footpad was measured by a caliper. The cell mediated immunity suppressive effects of the test compounds were determined by comparing the degree of footpad swelling in the treated animals with the degree of footpad swelling 100 in untreated control animals that were subcutaneously injected in their footpads with an aqueous solution of SRBC in physiological saline instead of the test compounds. The results are summarized in the following table. This experiment illustrates the suppressive effects of Plipastatin on the reaction of lymphocyte blast genesis. The reaction of lymphocyte blast genesis was evaluated in terms of the incorporation of ³H thymidine in the DNA synthesis by both T cells and B cells stimulated with concanavalin A hereunder referred to as ConA and lipopolysaccharide of In the reaction of T lymphocyte blast genesis, the T cells were obtained by passing spleen cells of BALB c mice 19 weeks old through a nylon column to remove absorbent cells and by then cultivating the resulting spleen cells in a plastic Petri dish for one hour to eliminate the remaining absorbent cells. The cultivation of the T cells was conducted in wells of a Falcon microtest plate using RPMI 1640 medium containing 20 fetal bovine serum, 25 ml of Hepes, 100 µm ml of streptomycin and 100 U ml of penicillin G. The T lymphocytes 1 x 10⁵ , 5 µg ml of ConA and the acylpeptide BMG302 fF67 A₁ or B₁ were added in that order to the wells and said medium was then added to the wells to make a total of 0.2 ml. The resulting mixture was incubated for 72 hours. The mixture was pulse labeled with ³H thymidine at 8 hours before terminating the cultivation. The reaction of B lymphocyte blast genesis was performed following the same conditions as set forth above except that the spleen cells were substituted for the T cells and that 100 µg ml of LPS was used in place of the ConA. Plipastatin A₁ at a concentration of 100 µg ml suppressed the incorporation of ³H tymidine in the ConA stimulated T lymphocytes and the LPS stimulated B lymphocytes by 52 and 15 , respectively. Also, Plipastatin B₁ blocked the ConA stimulated reaction of T lymphocyte blast genesis and the LPS stimulated reaction of B lymphocyte blast genesis by 54 and 20 , respectively. These data show that Plipastatin is a substance capable of suppressing the cell mediated immunity in normal animals. The study on the pharmacological effects of Plipastatin showed that is has suppressive effects on PCA Passive Cutaneous Anaphylasix reaction. The following experiments will demonstrate that suppressive effects of Plipastatin A₁ of the present invention on PCA reactions. This experiment shows the suppressive effects of Plipastatin A₁ on PCA reactions. The experiment described below was accomplished in accordance with conventional methods. Reference J. Immunology, 106, 1002 1011, 1971 . Rats were sensitized with egg albumin antigen to obtain an anti serum. The rats of the S D strain male, 8 week of age were passively sensitized by intradermal injection of 50 µl of the thus obtained anti egg albumin serum on their backs. Forty eight hours later, each rat was challenged by the intraveneous injection of physiological saline containing egg albumin 2.5 mg plus Evans blue 2.5 mg . Sixty minutes after the injection, any development of blue dye patch due to the extravasation of Evans blue at the sensitized site was checked. Five minutes before the challenge, the test compound 150 µl was intradermally injected at the sensitized site. DSCG disodium cromoglycate was used as a control. The test results are summarized in Table 4 below. As shown in Table 4, the intradermal injections of 590 and 59 µM Plipastatin A₁ cause suppressive effects on PCA reactions that are comparable to those of DSCG. These data support the fact that the compound exhibits suppressive effects on type I allergic disorders such as asthma, pollinosis and atopic dermatitis. As is clear from the experiments set forth above, Plipastatin of the present invention has suppressive effects on the cell mediated immunity as well as relatively low toxicities, so it will be useful as an immunosuppressive agent having a different mechanism of action from conventional immunosuppressive drugs. In addition, Plipastatin exhibits suppressive effects on PCA reactions, so it will also be useful as an anti allergic agent. The present invention will be further illustrated by the following examples which are not intended to limit the scope of the invention, and it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. A medium pH 7.4 comprising 2.5 of glycerin, 0.5 of beef extract product of Kyokuto K.K. , 0.5 of polypeptone, 1.0 of yeast extract product of Oriental K.K. , 0.2 of NaCl, 0.05 of MgSO₄ 7H₂O, 0.32 of CaCO₃, 0.05 of a mixture of Silicon KM 70 product of Shinetsu Kagaku K.K. and soybean oil JP 1 1 as an antifoaming agent was sterilized in an autoclave at 120 C for 20 minutes. To a 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask was charged a 120 ml portion of the sterilized medium which was inoculated with a loop of the Plipastatin producing strain FERM P No. 7843 . The inoculated medium was incubated at 27 C for a day on a rotary shaker 180 rpm min. . A 1 ml portion of the seed culture thus obtained was transferred into a 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 120 ml of said sterilized medium and cultivated with shaking for a day under the same conditions as set forth above. The cultured broth was filtered at pH 7.4 to remove the cells and obtain 18 l of a filtrate. The IC₅₀ value of the filtrate for the inhibition of phospholipase D was 32 µl ml. The filtrate was passed through a column packed with Amberlite XAC 7 2 l to adsorb any enzyme inhibiting substance. The column was then washed with water 8 l and eluted with 80 methanol 4 l to collect fractions containing the active material. The combined fractions were concentrated under reduced pressure to dryness to give 24.6 g of brown crude powder having an IC₅₀ value of 18 µg ml. A solution of the thus obtained crude powder in n propanol was passed through an n propanol filled column of silica gel 1 l , followed by successive elution with n propanol 800 ml , 90 n propanol solution 2 l and 80 n propanol solution 2.5 l to collect the fractions containing the active substances, which were concentrated under vacuum to dryness. A brown powder 2.15 g containing Plipastatin B₁ and B₂ IC₅₀ 15 µg ml was obtained from the 90 n propanol eluted fractions, and 2.0 g of a brown powder containing Plipastatin A₁ and A₂ IC₅₀ 9.5 µg ml from the 80 n propanol eluted fractions. The brown powder of Group A thus obtained was passed through a column of silanized silica gel 400 ml preliminary filled with a 6 4 mixture of methanol and acetic acid buffer 1 potassium acetate plus 3 acetic acid, pH 5 , followed by elution with the same mixture to collect the fractions containing the active substance. The combined fractions were then concentrated under reduced pressure to dryness. The resulting solid was dissolved in a small amount of 80 methanol and the solution was subjected to desalting for removal of excess potassium acetate on a column of Sephadex LH 20 that was eluted with 80 methanol. The fractions containing the active substances were collected and concentrated under reduced pressure to dryness to give 994 mg of a pale yellow powder IC₅₀ 9.5 µg ml . The powder so obtained was passed through a column for High Pressure Liquid Chromatography HPLC product of Senshu Kagaku K.K. Nucleosil 5 C₁₈ 20 x 300 m m flor rate 8 ml min preliminary equilibrated with a 1 1 mixture of acetonitrile and acetic acid buffer 2 potassium acetate plus 6 acetic acid, pH 4 , followed by elution with said equilibrating fluid to collect the fractions containing each of Plipastatin A₁ and A₂. The combined fractions were then concentrated to dryness and the resulting solids were desalted by the same method as used for desalting the eluate from the silanized silica gel column, thereby giving 542 mg of Plipastatin A₁ IC₅₀ 2.1 µg ml as a colorless powder and 152 mg of Plipastatin A₂ IC₅₀ 3.8 µg ml , also a colorless powder. The brown powder containing Group B B₁ and B₂ of the present invention obtained from the 90 n propanol eluting fractions was also passed through a column of silanised silica gel 200 ml preliminary filled with 40 methanol, followed by successive elution with 40 methanol 1.5 l and 50 methanol 1.5 l to collect the fractions containing the active substances. The combined fractions were then concentrated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in a small amount of 80 methanol and the resulting solution was passed through a column of Sephadex LH 20, followed by elution with 80 methanol to collect the fractions containing the active substances which were then concentrated to dryness to give 545 mg of a pale yellow powder IC₅₀ 8 µg ml . The powder so obtained was then passed through a column for HPLC Nucleosil 5 C₁₈ 20 x 300 m m flow rate 8 ml min preliminary equilibrated with a 65 35 mixture of acetonitrile and acetic acid buffer 2 potassium acetate plus 6 acetic acid, pH 4 , followed by elution with said equilibrating fluid to collect the fractions containing each of Plipastatin B₁ and B₂. The respective fractions were concentrated to dryness. The residues were desalted by eluting them with 80 methanol from a column of Sephadex LH 20 to give 151 mg of Plipastatin B₁ IC₅₀ 2.8 µg ml as a colorless powder and 89 mg of Plipastatin B₂ IC₅₀ 3.3 µg ml , also a colorless powder. The following chemical experiments and instrumental analysis were conducted in order to determine the structure of the fatty acids making up the substances of the present invention. Plipastatin A₁ or B₁ of the present invention was subjected to methanolysis in a 30 HCl methanol at 50 C for 2 days and then concentrated to dryness. The resulting residue was extracted with diethyl ether. The extract was subjected to thin layer chromatography hereunder referred to as TLC on silica gel developing solvent chloroform methanol 50 1 to separate the methanolysis product. The instrumental analysis of the product with NMR and MS showed that the fatty acid making up Plipastatin A₁ and B₁ of the present invention is β hydroxy hexadecanoilic acid β hydroxy palmitic acid . In the same manner as set forth above, the fatty acid making up Plipastatin A₂ and B₂ or the present invention was determined as β hydroxy anti isohexadecanoilic acid β hydroxy anti isopalmitic acid . The following enzymatic and chemical analysis were made to determine the β hydroxy fatty acid and C end isoleucine which form the lactone ring of the present invention. The inhibitors of the present invention were digested with carboxypeptidase Y in accordance with the following two methods and the amino acid liberated by the digestion was examined. Carboxypeptidase Y has the ability to successively cleave an amino acids sequence from its end to liberate a C end amino acid. The following two results occur after conducting enzymatic digestion by the respective methods On the basis of these data, the present inventors confirmed that the C end amino acid is Ile and that the lactone is formed at the C end. The functional groups capable of forming the lactone ring with the C end Ile are the hydroxy groups of the fatty acid, the two Tyrs and the Thr. When the inhibitors of the present invention were subjected to acetylation with acetic anhydride in a solution of pyridine, the hydroxy groups of the two Tyrs and Thr were acetylated, as confirmed by the NMR and MS spectra of the acetyl derivatives obtained. These results demonstrate that the C end Ile forms lactone with β hydroxy group of the fatty acid. Fig. 1 is the NMR spectrum of Plipastatin A₁ or the present invention as measured in dimethyl sulfoxide d₆ at 50 C. Figs. 2, 3 and 4 are NMR spectra of Plipastatin A₂, B₁ and B₂, respectively, as measured under the same conditions as in Fig. 1.
