# Methods of and apparatuses for processing binary data.

## Abstract
A method of processing binary data, which is preferably a digital television signal, comprises dividing the data into blocks of ten 8 bit words W₁ to W₁₀ , deriving an 8 bit parity word P each digit of which is a parity digit for the corresponding digits of the ten words W₁ to W₁₀ , deriving an 8 bit check word C by binary summing the ten words W₁ to W₁₀ and forming the check word C as the eight least significant bits of the result ing binary sum, subjecting to further processing, for example by magnetic recording and reproduction, the block of words including the parity word and the check word W₁ to W₁₀ PC , and thereafter checking the parity word P and the check word C to reveal errors occurring in the ten words W₁ to W₁₀ during the further processing.
