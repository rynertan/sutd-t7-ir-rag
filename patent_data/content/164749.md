# HIGH SPEED DATA COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM

## Abstract
An improved data transmission system has a transmitter which includes a modulator responsive to a synthesized mod ulating signal, which provides for transmission of data sub streams on parallel subchannels, for example, by using subcarrier frequencies. At the receiver the subcarriers are received and data is selected from the received subcarriers at two diverse receivers. In addition, there are provided sig nals added to the transmitted data for retiming the data at the receiver.
