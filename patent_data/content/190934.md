## Description
Method of manufacturing a thyristor The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a thyristor and, more particularly, to a method of manufacturing a gate turn off GTO thyristor. Conventional GTO thyristors do not require a commutating circuit since they can be turned on and off by applying a positive or negative bias to the gate electrode. Due to their short switching time, GTO thyristors are capable of high frequency operation. In GTO thyristors, however, thermal breakdown occurs when the power loss during turn off reaches a certain value. This is because local current crowding occurs in GTO thyristors during turn off. As a result, the anode current flow must be kept under about 2,000 A, making the current capacity of GTO thyristors lower than that of a normal thyristor. In order to resolve this problem, GTO thyristors generally use a multi emitter structure. In a multiemitter structure, the cathode region is divided and a plurality of small GTO elements are connected in parallel to the divided portions. By using such a structure the current crowding in a region of the GTO can be attenuated through dispersion and current capacity can thus be increased somewhat. Even with this improvement, however, current crowding still occurs to a certain extent in each GTO element, such that the problem is not significantly resolved. More specifically, the balance of the anode current flowing between the GTO elements is lost during turn off, current crowding occurs in one or more of theGTO elements, and, in the end, breakdown occurs. One of the causes of this is as follows. In present thyristor manufacturing techniques, it is difficult to obtain a uniform carrier lifetime when diffusion is performed I over the entire surface of a wafer having a diameter of 20 40 mm or more. Another cause is the unsatisfactory turn off breakdown properties of the respective GTO elements. In order to resolve this problem, a method of increasing the breakdown voltage of the junction between an n type emitter layer and a p type base layer by reducing the sheet resistance of the p type base layer has been proposed Japanese Patent DisclosureNo. 53 110386 . Towards the same end, a method ofgiving a p type base layer a low sheet resistance and a uniform impurity concentration by using an epitaxial growth method has also been proposed Japanese PatentDisclosure No. 52 102687 . Examination of both of these proposed methods, however, reveals that neither is satisfactory in resolving the problem inherent in GTO thyristors. Whereas sufficient reduction in the sheet resistance of the p type base layer is contingent upon a base layer thickness of at least 30 pm, obtaining a sufficiently high injection efficiency for the n type emitter layer formed by diffusion in the p type base layer necessitates that the former be formed to a thickness of at least 20 pm. Consequently, when the p type base layer is formed using an epitaxial growth method, the epitaxial layer must be at least 50 pm in thickness. However, since epitaxial growth methods require high temperatures of about 12000 C, numerous defects are formed in the n type base layer i.e., the substrate , carrier lifetime is shortened, and the ON voltage of the GTO thyristor is increased. Finally, when an extremely thick epitaxial layer of more than 40 Um is formed, numerous defects are also formed in the grown layer, the lifetime of the carriers in the p type base layer is shortened, and theON voltage of the GTO thyristor is thus increased. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of manufacturing a thyristor having a long carrier lifetime and a high turn off breakdown current, without using an epitaxial method. According to the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a thyristor having a base layer comprising first and second impurity layers which are bonded to each other, comprising the steps of bringing, in an atmosphere virtually free of particulate matter, a first semiconductor substrate having a first impurity layer whose surface is mirror polished into contact with a second semiconductor substrate having a second impurity layer whose surface is mirror polished and which is of the same conductivity type as the first impurity layer, such that no foreign substances interfere with their contact and annealing the first and second semiconductor substrates, whose mirror polished surfaces are in contact with each other, at a temperature of not less than 2000C so as to bond the mirror polished surfaces together and thereby form a base layer consisting of the first and second impurity layers. The base layer produced as above is a p type base layer and or a low resistance n type base layer. With the method of the present invention, after the first and second semiconductor substrates are bonded together, one or both surfaces of the substrates are polished to adjust the thickness of the resultant structure. P and n type emitter layers are then formed. For the purposes of polishing, an optical polishing method such as a mirror polishing method can be adopted. The roughness of polished surfaces should, preferably, o be 500 A or less. It should be noted that surface roughness is given by a maximum height Rmax as de .fined in JISB 0601 1982 . Once polished, surfaces should preferably be washed with water, surfactant, organic solvent, acid solution, or the like in order to remove contaminants such as fine particles, absorbed ions, organic material, inorganic material, and the like. A room whose environment con 3 tains no more than 20 particles m of foreign substances is considered clean enough to allow for the desired particulate free contact and subsequent bonding of the polished and washed surfaces. The annealing temperature should, preferably, fall within the range of 600 to l2000C. Unlike when forming a low resistance base layer by means of an opitaxial method, a pnpn wafer can, according to the present invention, be easily obtained without using a lengthy annealing process. Furthermore, since the carrier lifetime of p type and n type base layers can be prolonged sufficiently, a thyristor a GTO thyristor having low ON voltage and high turn off breakdown current can be realized. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Figs. 1A to 1D are sectional views showing steps in the manufacture of the thyristor in Example 1 of the present invention Fig. 2A is a graph showing the relationship between an annealing temperature and the sheet resistance of a p type portion after bonding Fig. 2B is a graph showing the impurity concentration distribution of the thyristor obtained inExample 1 Figs. 3 and 4 are graphs comparing the characteristics of the thyristor obtained in Example 1 with those of a conventional thyristor Figs. 5A to 5C are sectional views showing steps in the manufacture of the thyristor in Example 2 of the present invention Fig. 6 is a graph showing the impurity concentration distribution of the thyristor obtained inExample 2 Fig. 7 is a graph showing the impurity concentration distribution of the thyristor obtained inExample 3 Fig. 8 is a graph showing the impurity concentration distribution of the thyristor obtained inExample 4 Fig. 9 is a graph showing the impurity concentration distribution of the thyristor obtained inExample 5 Figs. 10A to 10C are sectional views showing steps in the manufacture of the thyristor in Example 6 of the present invention Fig. 11 is a graph showing the impurity concentration distribution of the thyristor obtained inExample 6 Fig. 12 is a graph showing the impurity concentration distribution of the thyristor obtained inExample 7 Fig. 13 is a sectional view of the thyristor obtained in Examp1e Figs. 14A and 14B are sectional views showing steps in the manufacture of the thyristor in Example 9 Fig. 15 is a graph showing the impurity concentration distribution of the thyristor obtained inExample 9 and Fig. 16 is a graph showing the impurity concentration distribution of the thyristor obtained inExample 10. The present invention will be described by way of examples and with reference to the accompanying drawings.Example 1 Figs. 1A to 1D show steps in the manufacture of theGTO thyristor in Example 1. As shown in Fig. 1A, p type layer 12, as a portion of a low resistance p type base layer, is formed on the surface of n type Si substrate first semiconductor substrate 11 as a high resistance n type base layer. P type Si substrate second semiconductor substrate 13 is prepared and constitutes the remaining portion of the p type base layer. Substrate 17 18 3 13 has an impurity concentration of 10 to 101 cm3. The surfaces of the two substrates are, prior to bonding, mirror polished to provide a surface roughness of 500 A or less. P type layer 12, formed on the surface of substrate 11, can be obtained by boron or gallium diffusion, and has, preferably, a diffusion width of 10 18 3 to 30 pm and a surface concentration of 1018 cm3 or more. The substrates are then subjected to pretreatment using a solution mixture of H202 B2SO4, an HF solution, and a dilute HF solution in that order to remove grease and stain films. The substrates are washed with purified water for several minutes and are then spindried at room temperature. This last step removes only excess water and not that adsorbed in the mirror polished surfaces of the substrates.Therefore, the substrate must not be heated to a temperature of 1000C or higher, at which almost all of the adsorbed water would vaporize. Substrates 11 and 13, obtained through the above procedures, are placed into a pure atmosphere of, for example, Class 1 or below, and their polished surfaces are brought into contact with each other, as shown inFig. 1B, such that no foreign substances lie therebetween. The substrates are annealed at a temperature of 2000C or higher to produce a bonded substrate with enhanced adhesive strength. Bonding interface 14 exhibits characteristics of good ohmic contact. The thickness of substrate 11 is determined by that of the high resistance n type base layer. For example, when an element having a breakdown voltage of 4.5 kV is used, the thickness of substrate 11 should be about 700 to 800 pm. The thickness of substrate 13 should be 300 Pm or more in consideration of the above bonding procedure. The substrate 13 side of the resultant substrate is polished to obtain a 50 pm thick p type layer. Phosphorus or the like is then doped into the polished surface to form 20 pm thick, n type emitter layer 15.P type emitter layer 16 is formed on the back surface of substrate 11. P type emitter layer 16 can also be formed before the substrates are bonded together. In this way, a pnpn wafer which will serve as the basic structure of a thyristor can be obtained. As shown in Fig. 1D, n type emitter layer 15 is divided into a plurality of portions by a known selective etching method. Cathode electrode 17, gate electrode 18, anode electrode 19, and protective film 20 are then formed on respective portions of divided layer 15, thus preparing a GTO thyristor. Fig. 2A shows the relationship between an annealing temperature, annealing being performed to improve the bonding strength, and the sheet resistance of a p type portion after bonding Fig. 1B . The sheet resistances of p type layers 12 and 13, as measured bya four point probe method, are 40 R D. As shown in Fig. 2A, it is desired that the substrates be thermally annealed, for purposes of bonding, at temperatures of from 600 to 12000 C. Fig. 2B shows the impurity concentration distribution of the GTO thyristor obtained in this example.The GTO thyristor of this example has a higher maximum turnoff current and a lower ON voltage than a conventional thyristor. A GTO thyristor with a breakdown voltage of 4.5 kV was manufactured in order to compare its characteristics with those of a conventional thyristor. Fig. 3 is a graph comparing the maximum turn off currents of the GTO thyristor obtained in this example, with those of a conventional GTO thyristor. In Fig. 3, line A indicates data for the GTO thyristor of this example, and line B indicates data for a conventionalGTO thyristor in which the p type base layer is formed by diffusion. As is well known, maximum turn off current is inversely proportional to the sheet resistance of the p type base layer. As indicated by line B, in the conventional thyristor, even if the width of the p type base layer is increased, the sheet resistance cannot easily be reduced. This is because the impurity concentration distribution is, due to diffusion, represented by a complementary error function.In contrast to this, the maximum turn off current in the thyristor of this example can easily be increased since its sheet resistance is inversely proportional to the width of the p type base layer. In this example, assuming that the thickness of p type layer 12, formed by diffusion at the side of substrate 11, is 20 pm and that the concentration of substrate 13 is 5 x 10 15 cm3, the p type base 13 3 layer exhibits a total charge amount of 1 x 1013 cm3 and a sheet resistance of about 20 n O. At this time, as shown in Fig. 3, the maximum turn off current is about 4,000 A. In the conventional thyristor, however, when the width of the p type base layer is 55 pm, its sheet resistance is about 50 E and its maximum turn off current is about 2,500 A. Fig. 4 shows the results of a comparison of ON voltages when the current density is 100 A cm2. As is well known, ON voltage depends on the width, the impurity concentration and the carrier lifetime of the p type base layer. As shown in Fig. 4, although ON voltages curves A and B increase upon an increase in width of the p type base layer, curve A this example becomes slightly steeper than curve B the conventional thyristor because of the weaker drift effect of electrons injected into the p type base layer of the thyristor of this example.The GTO thyristor of this example, having a breakdown voltage of 4.5 kV, can provide a maximum turn off current of 4,000 A and an ON voltage of l.5 V, whereas the conventional thyristor, having a p type base layer width of 55 pm, provides a maximum turn off current of 2,500 A and an ON voltage of 2.5 V. According to this example, then, the maximum turn off voltage can be notably increased and the ON voltage reduced. In the conventional method of forming a p type base layer by an epitaxial growth method, the ON voltage is increased undesirably when a thick p type base layer is formed. For example, when the width of the p type base layer is about 30 pm, the ON voltage is about 2 0 V.The thyristor of this example is thus superior to a conventional one.Example 2 Figs. SA to 5C show steps in the manufacture of theGTO thyristor in Example 2. As shown in Fig. 5A, p type layer 22, as a part of a p type base layer, is formed on a polished surface of n type Si substrate first semiconductor substrate 21 as a high resistance n type base layer whose surface is mirror polished. In addition, p type layer 24, constituting the remaining portion of the p type base layer, is formed by diffusion on a mirror polished surface of p type Si substrate second semiconductor substrate 23. As shown in Fig. SB, the mirror polished surfaces of the substrates were subjected to purification and subsequently bonded, in the same manner and under the same conditions as in Example 1.Substrate 23 need only have a higher resistance than p type layer 24, or can be of an n type. The surface of the resultant substrate at the side of substrate 23 is polished to a predetermined thickness. N type emitter layer 26 and p type emitter layer 27, shown in Fig. 5C are then formed by impurity diffusion in the polished surface. As in Example 1, type emitter layer 27 can be formed before the substrates are bonded together. AGTO thyristor is obtained using the thus formed pnpn wafer as its basic structure in the same manner as inExample 1. Fig. 6 shows the impurity concentration distribution of the GTO thyristor obtained in Example 2. The same effects as in Example 1 can be obtained in Example 2. As can be seen from Fig. 6r in Example 2, since the sheet resistance of the p type base layer can be controlled by the impurity concentration of the diffusion layers at the two sides of bonding interface 25, control of the sheet resistance of the p type base layer is improved over that of the thyristor of Example 1.Example 3 In Examples 1 and 2, the impurity concentrations at either side of bonding interface 25 differ. As shown inFig. 7, however, impurity concentrations at either side of interface 25 can be made equal. This is advantageous when two p type layers are utilized in order to reduce the sheet resistance of the p type base layer.Example 4 In Fig. 8, the relationship between the impurity concentrations of p type layers 22 and 24 is reversed to that shown in Fig. 6. A structure wherein p type layers have th is relationship is proposed in order to reduce the sheet resistance of the p type base layer by using p type layer 22 at the side of the n type base layer.This structure can easily suppress the high concentration impurity doping effect which is a major cause of inefficiency in electron injection from the n type emitter layer. Thus, the ON voltage can be decreased. A high impurity concentration layer portion of the p type base layer can be formed by ion implantation at a concentration of 1015 to 1016 cm3, and subsequent thermal diffusion at a temperature of 1,000 to l,2500C for 10 to 50 hours.Example 5 Fig. 9 shows the impurity concentration distribution when the same impurity concentration distribution as in Example 4, shown in Fig. 8, is achieved by the method of Example 1, shown in Figs. 1A to 1D.Example 6 In Examples 1 to 5, the horizontal impurity concentration distribution in the p type base layer is uniform. The present invention, however, is also effective when the horizontal impurity distribution varies in the p type base layer. Figs. 10A to 10C show steps in the manufacture of the GTO thyristor of this example. As shown inFig. l0A, p type layer 32, as a portion of the p type base layer, is formed on the mirror polished surface of n type Si substrate first semiconductor substrate 31 as a high resistance n type base layer. P type layers 33 are then selectively formed on the gate region öf the surface of layer 32. P type layers 35 Åare selectively formed on the gate region of the polished surface of p type Si substrate second semiconductor substrate 34 and constitute the remaining portion of the p type base layer.These substrates are bonded together in the same manner as in the above examples, and the thickness of the resultant structure, shown in Fig. 10B, is control led. Then, n type emitter layer 37 and p type emitter layer 38 are formed on the structure. P type emitter layer 38 can also be formed before the substrates are bonded together. The structure is mesa etched so as to form cathode electrode 39, gate electrode 40, anode electrode 41, and protective film 42, as shown inFig. 10C, thus completing the GTO thyristor. Fig. 11 shows, in cross sectional views taken along lines A A and B B in Fig. 10C, the impurity concentration distribution of the GTO thyristor obtained in Example 6. The GTO thyristor of this example has a small ON voltage due to the small total chargewamount of the p type base layer in a conductive portion under cathode electrode 39. In addition, since the p type base layer under gate electrode 40 comprises p type layers 33 and 35, the total charge amount thereof is large, and the maximum turn off current increases.Example 7 Fig. 12 shows the impurity concentration distribution to correspond with Fig. 11 when the position of interface 36 is slightly shifted from that in Example 6, and, more specifically, when p type layer 33, at, as shown in Fig. 10A, the side of substrate 31, is formed at the side of substrate 34, and the junction between layers 33 and 32 is used as a bonding interface. In this example, the same effect as in the above examples can be obtained.Example 8 Fig. 13 shows a slightly modified version of theExample 6 GTO thyristor shown in Figs. 10A through 10C.In this example, p type layers 33 are arranged in grid form not only on the gate region but also in a region under the cathode electrode, as can be seen from a comparison with Fig. 10C. This structure is useful in shuting off the current during turn off. Example 9 In the above examples, the bonding interface is located in the p type base layer. The present inventiop, however, is not limited to this arrangement. For examp a GTO thyristor with a structure in which a low resistance n type base layer buffer layer is provided sst the side of the p type emitter layer of a high resis tan p type base layer has been proposed.This struc curve çan be adopted in order to reduce the width of the. type base layer and thereby to reduce the ON voltage by suppressing extension of a depletion layer in a normal breakdown state at the cost of reverse breakdown voltage, and to shorten the turn off period by controlling holes injected from the p type emitter layer during turn on. According to the present invention, when this structure is adopted, the substrate connection interface can also be located in the low resistance n type base layer. Figs. 14A and 14B show steps in the manufacture of the GTO thyristor of Example 9. As shown in Fig. 14A, type layer 52, as a first portion of a low resistance n type base layer, is formed on the mirror polished surface of n type Si substrate first semiconductor substrate 51 as a high resistance n type base layer.N type layer 54, constituting the second portion of the low resistance n type base layer, is formed on the mirror polished surface of n type Si substrate second semiconductor substrate 53. These substrates are bonded together in the same manner as in the above examples, and the thickness of the resultant structure is controlled as required. P type base layer 56 is formed on the resultant structure by diffusion, and n type emitter layer 57 and p type emitter layer 58 are formed thereon, thus obtaining a pnpn wafer. Thereafter, the GTO thyristor is completed through normal procedures. Fig. 15 shows the impurity concentration distribution of the GTO thyristor obtained in Examp le 9. With the method of this example, a GTO thyristor with excellent characteristics can easily be obtained when compared with the product of the conventional method which uses an epitaxial method.Example 10 Fig. 16 shows the impurity concentration distribution of a GTO thyristor in which bonding interface 59 is also provided in the p type base layer, to correspond with that shown in Fig. 15. In this example, the sameGTO thyristor as in Example 8 is produced using three substrates. The relationship between turn off gain S of theGTO thyristor and current amplification factors anpn and apnp when the pnpn structure of the GTO thyristor is represented by pnp and npn transistors is as follows anpn anpn apnp 1 When turn off gain ss is increased, gate current during turn off can be decreased so as to control a large current. For this purpose, factor anpn must be increased.In the conventional method, a single substrate is formed on a pnpn wafer using an epitaxial method and a diffusion technique, and a heavy metal e.g., gold is then diffused at a temperature of 8000C or higher in order to accelerate attenuation of carriers in the n type base layer during turn off. As a result, however, the lifetimes of the n type base layer and the p type base layer are shortened, and factor anpn is unpreferably decreased. According to the method of the present invention, even if a heavy metal e.g., gold is diffused at the side of the n type base layer, or an electron beam or the like is radiated onto the n type base layer before the substrates are bonded together, though the lifetime of the n type base layer will be reduced, that of the p type base layer will not be. Therefore, a large factor anpn can be mainatined and a GTO thyristor with large turn off gain ss obtained. In this case, it is preferable that the electron beams be radiated sufficiently to provide a sufficient radiation effect even after the time killer is extinguished during the subsequent annealing step. Though in Examples 1 to 9, the manufacture of GTO thyristors has been explained, the present invention can also be applied to the manufacture of various other thyristors, for example, reverse conduction thyristors, optical thyristors, and the like.
