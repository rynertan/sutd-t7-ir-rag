# Sulfonated rubrene and aqueous chemiluminescent compositions containing the same.

## Abstract
Water soluble sulfonated rubrenes are used as fluores cer components in water soluble chemiluminescent mix tures and particularly in combination with a water soluble amide of oxalic acid which reacts with hydrogen peroxide to produce chemiluminescence.
