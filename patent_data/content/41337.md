# Dispersion of solid carbonaceous material in water.

## Abstract
Quaternised ammonium synthetic polymers having a solution viscosity, as measured on a 1 solution in deionised water at 25 C using a suspended level viscometer, of from 1 to 500 cs are used as dispersing agents in aqueous slurries of water and solid particulate carbonaceous material.
