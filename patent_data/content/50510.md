# Radiography apparatus.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a radiography apparatus comprising an X ray tube 10 for radiating X ray beam in a fan shape, a detector 14 for detecting the X ray beam coming through a living body 16 every given angle component of the X ray beam, and a sampling circuit 24 for sampling an output signal of the detector 14 when the living body 16 moves at a given speed in a direction orthogonal to a plane along which the X ray beams are radiated, whereby a radiogram is formed by using an output signal of the sampling circuit 24 . In the radiography apparatus, a distance between the living body 16 and the X ray tube 10 is variable and is detected by a potentiometer 20 interlocked with the move ment of the living body 16 . A pulse signal at a frequency corresponding to an output level of the potentiometer 20 is produced by a pulse frequency modulation circuit 22 , and is supplied as a timing signal to the sampling circuit 24 . Thus, a sampling period of the sampling circuit 24 is determined depending on the distance between the X ray tube 10 and the living body 16 , so that a radiogram with the same expansion rates in the X and Y directions is obtained.
