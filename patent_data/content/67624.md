# Manufacture of isethionates.

## Abstract
The invention discloses the preparation of alkali metal isethionates from ethionic acid and the use of these isethion ates to prepare surface activity fatty acyl isethionates. A mixture of calcium hydroxide and alkali metal hydroxide is used to obtain the isethionate. An alkali or an alkali metal soap is used to obtain a light coloured fatty acyl isethionate having a yellowness index less than 10 at the esterification stage.
