# IMPROVED COANDA EFFECT NOZZLE FOR HANDLING CONTINUOUS WEBS

## Abstract
A coanda effect nozzie includes first and second longitu dinal airfoils mounted in spaced apart relationship generally transverse to the travel of the web. A mechanism is mounted between the first and second airfoils to define orifices adjacent each of the airfoils, so as to create first and second Coanda streams of air along the first and second airfoils, respectively. The first stream of air travels in a direction opposite to the travel of the second stream of air. The first and second streams of air travel generally parallel to the web.
