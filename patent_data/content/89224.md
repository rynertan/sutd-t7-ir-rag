# CONDUCTIVE CHARGE DISCHARGE DEVICE

## Abstract
Both charging and discharging devices 16, 26, 28, 48 for an electrostatic xerographic and other types of elec trophotographic copiers or printers are constructed in the form of a filament brush 30 , the fibers of which are each electrically conductive and connected to a potential voltage source whereby the individual fiber tips 33 will function as a corona discharge source to charge or discharge the photo conductive surface of an electrostatic copier but with sub stantially reduced power requirements.
