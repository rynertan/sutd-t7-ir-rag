New York 1973 . This invention also concerns a method for making compounds of Formulas I and II from aminopyrazoles as follows SelectedAminopyrazoles IV III I and II. Including V DETAILS OF THE INVENTION One route to pentathiepins of this invention is by the following series of reactions EMI8.1 wherein R1 and Z are as defined with respect to the broad class of compounds of Formulas III and IV. Compounds VA are prepared by reaction of l substituted 3 aminopyrazoles with acetonylacetone and acid catalyst. This simply blocks the amino function during subsequent functionalization at position 5.EMI9.1 VA where Z H The compounds VA where Z is other than H are prepared by treatment of VA where Z.H with a base such as n butyllithium. t butyllithium. phenyllithium or lithium diisopropylamide at about 80 to 50 in non protic solvents THF or ether and subsequent reaction with an electrophile such as alkyl halides, cyanogen halides. alkyl or aryl chloroformates. Thus VA Electrophile VA where where Z H RLi THF Z other than H Deprotection is accomplished by reaction ofVA with hydroxylamine hydrochloride and alcoholic alkali solution such as KOH or NaOH in MeOH or EtOH, or aqueous combinations of these solvents.The reaction for deprotection occurs at 50 to 120 C 60 to 900C gives best results. The Hetero Herz reaction requires an inert atmosphere nitrogen, helium, argon and proceeds at 20 to 800C. Excess S2C12 with acid diluent, such as acetic acid a works well as does neatS2C12 and an acid salt of VB. The conversion of IV to III is by base hydrolysis and reduction followed by diazotization.Suitable bases include alkali netal hydroxides or bicarbonates suitable reducing agents are bisulfites and hydrosulfite. The method for making compounds of FormulasI and II is by reacting the corresponding thiadiazoles with elemental sulfur at elevated temperatures. The reaction temperature is maintained at about 800 to 2000C the preferred range is about 1100C to 1700C. It is carried out in inert solvents which do not react with sulfur and which boil at or above the reaction temperatures. Acceptable solvents include but are not limited to pyridine, decahydronaphthalene Decalin , dimethyl sulfoxide, xylenes, dichlorobenzenes. The process can be carried out at atmospheric pressure or at elevated pressures which allow the use of lower boiling solvents at elevated temperatures. There is no requirement for an inert atmosphere, although one can be used. The molar ratio of sulfur calculated as Sub to thiadiazole can be from about 1 2 to 2 1 the preferred ratio is about 1 1. A relatively non volatile, tertiary organic amine can be added to lower the reaction temperature. Examples of such amines include pyridine and la4 diazabicyclo 2.2.2 octane DABCO DABCO is preferred. If used, the amine is added in a molar ratio, relative to thiadiazole, of about 0.1 1 to 2 1 a molar ratio of about 1 1 is preferred.UtilitY The following Table summarizes the activity of selected pentathiepins as fungicides.

The methods for making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling. Granules and pellets can be made by spraying the active material on preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. Disease control is accomplished by applying the compounds of this invention to the portion of the plant to be protected. The compounds can be applied as preventive treatments prior to inoculation with the pathogen, or after inoculation as a curative post infection treatment. Rates of application for compounds of this invention will be influenced by specific host plants, fungal pathogens, and many factors of the environment must be determined under use conditions. Foliage sprayed with concentrations ranging from 1 to 500 ppm of active ingredient can be protected from disease under suitable conditions. The Control in Table 1 was calculated according to this formula EMI17.1 The pentathiepins of Formulas I and II are useful as sulfur sensitizers that give low fog levels in light sensitive colloid silver halide emulsion layers. They are effective in both negative and positive emulsions. The compounds of Formulas III,IV and V are intermediates to I and II and hence have ultimate utility in these photographic applications. The silver halide emulsion can be any of the usual types employed for medical or industrial x ray, graphic arts or portrait use. The silver halide crystal can also be any one of the usual types such as silver chloride, silver bromide, silver bromochloride or silver iodobromide. Particularly useful results have been obtained with high speed medical x ray films containing silver iodobromide crystals. Gelatin is the preferred binder for the silver halide crystals but it can be partially or completely replaced with other natural or synthetic binders as known in the art. Thus, binders used to improve covering power, e.g., dextran, dextrin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, as well as latices of polymers such as polyethyl acrylate which are useful in improving dimensional stability are advantageously included in many types of silver halide emulsions employed according to this invention. The range of compound concentration depends on the emulsion used and on the particular compound employed. A useful range of concentration is from 0.002 to 0.5 mmole per mole of silver halide with a preferred range being about 0.01 to 0.1 mmole. The support for the photographic element can be a polyethylene terephthalate film base as described in U.S. 2,627,088, but other coated and uncoated supports including those listed in U.S. 3,252,801 can also be used. Any of the usual emulsion adjuvants can be present in the silver halide layer, e.g., emulsion sensitizers, sensitizing dyes, coating aids, and the like. One manner in which pentathiepins of this invention can be employed as sulfur sensitizers is as follows. They can be added in a digestion step to an aqueous gelatin dispersion of silver iodobromide.Gold thiocyanate can also be employed. The sulfur sensitized photoemulsion formulation can then be coated on a support by one of ordinary skill in the art and worked up into film capable of a variety of specific end uses. One typical method for further workup is provided, for example, in U.S. 3,443,950. The following Examples illustrate this invention. Decalin refers to decahydronaphthalene kugelrohr refers to a bulb to bulb microdistillation assembly.
