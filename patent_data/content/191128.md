## Description
Title Topical Preparations for Human Skin Irritations This invention relates to topical preparations for aleviation of minor human skin irritations, including diaper rash. Parents have long recognized the discomfort caused to babies by the skin irritations known as diaper rash.When the breakdown of urea absorbed by a baby s diaper occurs, irritating combinations of ammonia result which cause skin irritation and can lead to serious skin infections of the baby s bottom if left untreated. Numerous attempts have been made to ameliorate the adverse effects of diaper rash and similar skin irritations. Liberal use of talcum powder and other agents, such as baby oils and the like have been used for generations to absorb the urea and ammonia compounds or coat the baby s bottom to prevent or lessen the effects of the rash. More recently, creams, lotions and oils containing other ingredients have been prepared to treat diaper rash. Prior art attempts include those found in U.S. Patents Nos.3,935,862 3,964,486 4,117,187 and 4,385,632. These and other preparations commercially available have been unsuccessful in doing more than reducing the adverse influence of the ammonia by products of urea or in protecting the baby s bottom from prolonged exposure to the effects of ammonium compounds on the baby s skin. However, once skin irritations, such as chapping, reddening, tenderness and the like, begin to appear, these preparations do little more than attempt to isolate the baby s skin until the body s natural healing processes reverse the irritation of the skin and the naturally healthy skin condition is gradually achieved. It is therefore an objective of this invention to provide a preparation to aid in the care of skin irritations, such as chapping, rashes, reddening, tenderness and the like. It is an additional objective of the invention to provide a topical preparation in a variety of carriers to aid in caring for skin irritations. These and other objectives which will become apparent areachieved with the invention described below. A topical preparation for the alevation of human skin irritations, including chapping, reddening, and tenderness, contains 8 Hydroxy Quinoline Sulfate or Parachlorometaxylenol in a formulation of carrier ingredients.The topical formulations can be in wipe on stick form, lotions, powders, aerosols, creams, ointments, jellies and oils. The formulations are useful in combatting diaper rash, foot rash, hand and face chapping and other forms of minor human skin irritations. A number of formulations of the invention have been made which can be employed to aid in the care of minor human skin irritations. Several examples of preferred embodiments of the invention follow to illustrate the range of formulations and the types of preparations available within the scope of the invention.EXAMPLE No. 1 DIAPER RASH CONTROL STICK Contents Percentage Mineral Oil 51.60 Polyethylene 15.00 Petrolatum Jelly 15.00 Talc 12.00 Lanolin 3.00 Allantoin 1.00 Kaolin 1.00 Titanium Dioxide 1.00 8 Hydroxy Quinoline Sulfate .30 Iron Oxides .05 Fragrance .05EXAMPLE No. 2 DIAPER RASH CONTROL STICK Contents Percentage Mineral Oil 51.60 Polyethylene 15.00 Petrolatum Jelly 15.00 Talc 12.00 Lanolin 3.00 Allantoin 1.00 Kaolin 1.00 Titanium Dioxide 1.00 Parachlorometaxyleno1 .30 Iron Oxides .05 Fragrance .05EXAMPLE No. 3 DIAPER RASH LOTION Contents Percentage Water 68.59 Aloe 7.00 Propylene Glycol 2.67 Bee Pollen 1.50 Collagen .30 TEA .90 Stearic Acid 4.00 Glyceryl Stearate 3.50 IPM 5.00 Cetyl Alcohol .80 JoJoBa Oil .30 Ergocalciferol .10 Tocopherol .10 Macademia Oil .10 Herbs Tea 4.00 Germaben II .83 Fragrance .01 8 Hydroxy Quinoline Sulfate .30 EXAMPLE No. 4 DIAPER RASH LOTION Contents Percentage Water 68.59 Aloe 7.00 Propylene Glycol 2.67 Bee Pollen 1.50 Collagen .30 TEA .90 Stearic Acid 4.00 Glyceryl Stearate 3.50 IPM 5.00 Cetyl Alcohol .80 JoJoBa Oil .30 Ergocalciferol .10 Tocopherol .10 Macademia Oil .10 Herbs Tea 4.00 Germaben II .83 Fragrance .01 Parachlorometaxylenol .30EXAMPLE No. 5 DIAPER RASH AEROSOL TYPE Contents Percentage Water 68.59 Aloe 7.00 Propylene Glycol 2.67 Bee Pollen 1.50 Collagen .30 TEA .90 Stearic Acid 4.00 Glyceryl Stearate 3.50 IPM 5.00 Cetyl Alcohol .80 JoJoBa Oil .30 Ergocalciferol .10 Tocopherol .10 Macademia Oil .10 Herbs Tea 4.00 Germaben II .83 Fragrance .01 8 Hydroxy Quinoline Sulfate .30EXAMPLE No. 6 DIAPER RASH AEROSOL TYPE Contents Percentage Water 68.59 Aloe 7.00 Propylene Glycol 2.67 Bee Pollen 1.50 Collagen .30 TEA .90 Stearic Acid 4.00 Glyceryl Stearate 3.50 IPM 5.00 Cetyl Alcohol .80 JoJoBa Oil .30 Ergocalciferol .10 Tocopherol .10 Mecademia Oil .10 Herbs Tea 4.00 Germaben II .83 Fragrance .01 Parachlorometaxylenol .30EXAMPLE No. 7 CREAM Contents Percentage Stearic Acid 4.00 GMS 8.00 Prop.Parobeu .10 Mineral Oil Id .00 Wickenol 163 2.00 Solvlan 98 2.40 Acetulan 1.60 Vitamin E .80 Avacado Oil 2.00 Selione .80 Germall 115 .30 Methylparabeu .20 Allantoin .20 P Glycol 4.00 Dowicil 200 .05 Aloe 1.00 Water 61.45 TEA .80 8 Hydroxy Quinoline Sulfate .30 EXAMPLE No. 8 CREAM Contents Percentage Stearic Acid 4.00 GMS 8.00 Prop.Parobeu .10 Mineral Oil 10.00 Wickenol 163 2.00 Solvlan 98 2.40 Acetulan 1.60 Vitamin E .80 Avacado Oil 2.00 Selione .80 Germall 115 .30 Methyl parobeu .20 Al lantoin .20 P Glycol 4.00 Dowicil 200 .05 Aloe 1.00 Water 61.45 TEA .80 Parachlorometaxylenol .30EXAMPLE No. 9 OINTMENT Contents Percentage Petrolatum 75.00 Lanolin 24.70 8 Hydroxy Quinoline Sulfate .30 EXAMPLE No. 10 OINTMENT Contents Percentage Petrolatum 75.00 Lanolin 24.70 Parachlorometaxylenol .30EXAMPLE No. 11 JELLY Contents Percentage Water 94.03 Aloe Powder .25 Prop.
