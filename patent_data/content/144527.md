# APPARATUS FOR PROTECTING ROTATING MACHINE PARTS AGAINST EXCESSIVE MECHANICAL LOADS

## Abstract
Apparatus for protecting rotating machine parts against excessive mechanical loads, said apparatus comprising torque limiting means 10 having an input shaft connectable to a motor 12 and an output shaft connectable to a load 14 slip sensing means, for detecting differences in speed between rotation of said input shaft and rotation of said output shaft and automatic protective means responsive to said slip sensing means, and operative to reduce the amount of slip, to avoid damage to said torque limiting means from excessive slip.
