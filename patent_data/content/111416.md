# Method for threading filaments on rollers of oxidizing furnace and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for threading acrylic filaments 2 on rollers 5,6 of an oxidizing furnace 1 , wherein a the atmospheric temperature in the furnace 1 is maintained at 180 C to the oxidizing temperature, b the tips of said filaments 2 are fastened to a filament fastening bar 28 spanning a pair of chains 19R,19L which engage chain wheels 5 n R,5 n L,6 n R,6 n L provided at both ends of each roller freely rotatable against the roller, c the chains 19R,19L are moved, thereby said filament fastening bar 28 attached to the chains being moved from the entrance 11 to the exit 12 of the furnace 1 and the filaments 2 being threaded on the rollers 5,6 , and d the moving speed of the chains 19R,19L is controlled with progress of heat treatment of the filaments 2 so as to match the behaviour of shrinkage and elongation of the filaments 2 .
