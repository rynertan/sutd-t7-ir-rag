# Production of herpes simplex viral proteins.

## Abstract
Methods and compositions are provided for the cloning and expression of Herpes Simplex Virus HSV type 1 or type 2 glycoprotein gD gene in single cell host organisms. Also described are methods for culturing these novel single cell or ganisms to produce HSV gene products. The HSV gD related polypeptides produced by the recombinant DNA techniques described herein may be formulated for use as immunogens in vaccines to protect against HSV 1 and HSV 2 infections.
