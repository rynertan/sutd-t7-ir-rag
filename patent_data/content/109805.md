# PIN PUNCH AND INSERTION MACHINE

## Abstract
The machine positions pins on variable centres and uses the pins both to punch the hole and provide the registration pin for the board stack. The unique part and function of the invention is believed to be that it uses a compressed air supply only by way of a pneumatic intensifier to raise the hydraulic pressure to 2400 lbs which drives two hydraulic Powerlode clamp units. These clamp units operate a spring loaded hollow punch which is driven over the pin to be fitted to the board. Another feature of the invention is that the pins are fed to the loading position by a pneumatic ram which relies on its designed shape to take up the pin upon its emergence from the magazine, and feed and lock it into its finally located position.
