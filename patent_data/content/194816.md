# Method for preparing silicon.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method for preparing poly crystalline pure silicon by reducing gaseous silicon tetra fluoride at a raised temperature by means of alkali metal or alkali earth and by recovering the silicon by means of liquid phase separation. According to the invention, the gaseous silicon tetrafluoride is reduced by fused alkali metal or alkali earth or powder dispersed into a liquid intermediate agent boiling at a high temperature.
