# Cell employing a coiled electrode assembly.

## Abstract
An electrochemical cell employing a coiled electrode assembly in which the segment of one wound electrode strip that is not sandwiched between layers of the other wound electrode strip has an average thickness less than the average thickness of the remaining segment of the electrode that is sandwiched between layers of the other wound electrode thereby providing for increased capacity input for a given cell volume and or provide for a high output rate capability for a given cell volume.
