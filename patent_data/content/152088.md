# COMMUNICATION SYSTEM BY PASS ARCHITECTURE

## Abstract
A data bus system having enhanced survivability in cludes a plurality of serially connected active terminals which may be configured in a user access mode to service users coupled thereto or a diagnostic mode during which the terminals undertake an analysis of the condition of the system and a determination is made of of the optimum available system configuration. Complementary redundant transmission paths extend between each terminal and the terminal adjacent together with a bypass transmission path which couples each terminal with the terminal beyond the adjacent terminal. The bypass paths in conjunction with the complementary transmission paths operate to allow a greater number of faults to occur in the transmission paths without bus degradation.
