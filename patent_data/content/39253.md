# Process for preparing carboxylic acid esters of dicyclopentadienes.

## Abstract
Mono and di carboxylate esters of dicyclopentadienes are prepared by reacting the dicyclopentadiene with carbon monoxide and an appropriate alcohol in the presence of a cobalt catalyst. In preparing the monocarboxylate, the reac tion is effected at a temperature of 130 C or less in the pres ence of at least 0.5 mole per moleof the dicyclopentadiene of a pyridine base. The dicarboxylate may then be prepared from this monocarboxylate by a further hydroesterification reac tion, with or without intermediate isolation of the monocar boxylate.
