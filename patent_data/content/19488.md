# Tilt valve and breathing apparatus with which it is used.

## Abstract
A tilt valve incorporated in a demand regulator for breathing apparatus has a head 16 which seats over an opening 17 through which the valve stem 20 extends for operation by a pressure responsive diaphragm 3 . The opening 17 defines the outlet port of a chamber 12 wherein the head 16 is disposed, the inlet port 11 of the chamber 12 opening to the same side of the head 16 as the outlet port 17 . Gas flowing from the inlet port 11 to the outlet port 17 therefore need not pass between the periphery of the head 16 and the surrounding wall of the chamber 12 , so that the head 16 can be close fit in the chamber 12 to ensure a consistent seating of the head 16 over the valved port 17 .

## Description
Valves The present invention relates to tilt valves. By a tilt valve is meant a valve of the kind in which there is a chamber having an inlet port and an outlet port, a valve head within the chamber adapted to seat over one of the ports to close that port to fluid flow, and a stem extending frond the valve head whereby tilting of the stem tilts the head away from its seating so as to open the valved port to fluid flow. Tilt valves can be utilized in breathing apparatus as disclosed for example in United Kingdom patent specifications 775.314 and 969.280 and in German patent specifications 1131998, 1139387 and 1185065, for regulating the supply of breathing gas to a user in accordance with his breathing demands. In such cases the valve is used in conjunction with a flexible diaphragm that responds to inhalation by the person using the apparatus to tilt the stem of the valve transitorily and thereby allow enough breathing gas to be supplied via the valve to satisfy the breathing need.In each of the tilt valves disclosed in United Kingdom patent specifications 775.314 and 969.280 and German patent specifications 1139387 and 1185065 the valve head is located to seat over the outlet port of a chamber provided in a hollow spigot which provides, at its inlet end, a union for connection to the supply of breathing gas. The spigot opens at its outlet end into a casing that contains the diaphragm, and the stem of the valve extends fram the head through the outlet port with clearance to respond to deflection of the diaphragm upon each inhalation. The arrangement in German patent specification 1131998 is generally similar except that in this case the valve head is spring urged within the chamber so as to seat over the inlet port rather than over the outlet port. Tilt valves such as those discussed above operate in general quite successfully, but have certain practical disadvantages. In particular, with a tilt valve such as disclosed in United Kingdom patent specification 775314 the valve head is free for a small degree of lateral movement across the width of the valve chamber such freedom is inherent in the necessity to maintain a gap of a sufficient size between the periphery of the valve head and the surrounding wall of the chamber to pass gas through the chamber fran its inlet port to its outlet port at the required rate when the valve is opened.Accordingly a fixed and consistent seating of the head over the valved port cannot be assured and multiple ringing grooving of the face of the head caused by the different impressions of the seating made in the face under different lateral positionings of the head over the port is likely to occur. Such multiple ringing leads to undesirable leakage through the valve. In order to reduce the incidence of leakage from ringing of the valve head in a tilt valve for use in high pressure systems, UnitedKingdom patent specification 949222 teaches the use of a valve spring arranged to exert a centering action on the valve head and to press the head against its seating in the same lateral position after each tilting of the head. However, a spring can provide only a resilient restraint and, being ne necessarily ss tilt normally. light in its action particularly in the case where the valve is incorporated in a demand regulator for breathing apparatus , cannot in general overcome the problem entirely satisfactorily. Furthermore the provision of a spring is desirably to be avoided in the interests of simplicity. The problem of multiple ringing of the valve head in a valve such as disclosed in United Kingdom patent specification 775314 could be overcome if the valve head was provided as a close fit in the chamber but such conflicts with the need to provide a gas pathway of sufficient size around the periphery of the head. German patent specifications 1131998, 1139387 and 1185065 each disclose a form of tilt valve in which the head fits closely within its chamber but has notches in its periphery to provide for gas flow past the head when the valve is opened.With valves of this form, however, problems arise in providing notches of a sufficient size to pass adequate gas flows and the manufacture of the head is inevitably ccrzlicated. In practice uncontrollable pressure losses are experienced with such valves due to the abrupt changes in flow direction and available flow area encountered by the gas as it passes the head. It is an aim of the present invention to provide a form of construction for a tilt valve which can be utilized to reduce the above discussed problems. Accordingly, in a first aspect the invention resides in a valve comprising a chamber having an inlet port and an outlet port, a valve head within the chamber adapted to seat over one of the ports to close that port to fluid flow, and a stem extending fran the valve head whereby tilting of the stem tilts the head away from its seating so as to open said one port to fluid flow wherein the other of the ports opens to the chamber at a location to the same side of the valve head as said one port, so that when the stem is tilted fluid can flow through the chamber from the inlet port to the outlet port without passing around the periphery of the head. By providing a flow path for the fluid which avoids passage around the periphery of the head in a tilt valve according to the invention, the head of the valve can be provided as a close fit within the chamber if desired, to ensure that lateral mavement of the head is positively limited so as to maintain it in a substantially consistent seating over the valved port. The problem of multiple ringing of the head thereby can be avoided. Furthermore the avoidance of a flow path which involves passage around the periphery of the head can lead to an imprnvement in the flow characteristics of the valve in comparison with prior art forms of tilt valve. In a preferred embodiment of a tilt valve in accordance with the invention the valve head is adapted to seat over the outlet port of the chamber. This form has the advantage that if the fluid pressure which is applied to the inlet port of thule chamber is transmitted to a space within the chamber to the opposite side of the valve head to the location of the ports such pressure can maintain the head upon its seating when the valve is closed, without the use of a valve spring.Such pressure transmission can be achieved by providing only a small gap between the periphery of the head and the surrour,ding wall of the chamber this gap being much smaller than that which would be required to pass the full flow of fluid through the valve and permitting no substantial lateral movement of the head. A valve as defined above may be constructed with a housing having a cylindrical bore closed at one end, an insert located in the bore and having a frusto conical projection directed axially towards said closed end, the aforesaid chamber being defined within the bore of the housing between said insert and closed end, the insert having an axial bore opening through the apex of its said projection to define said outlet port over which the valve head is adapted to seat, and the inlet port opening through the wall of said cylindrical bore at a location between the base and apex of said projection. It is also within the scope of the invention for the valve head to be arranged to seat over the inlet port rather than over the outlet port of the chamber, in such case a valve spring being required to maintain the head upon its seating when the valve is closed. The tilt valve of the invention is especially useful as part of a demand regulator for breathing apparatus and in a second aspect the invention resides in such a regulator cccprising a valve according to the first defined aspect of the invention of which the outlet port leads to a second chamber for ocounication with a face mask, mouthpiece or other breathing interface means and comprising means responsive to the difference between the pressure within the second chamber and the ambient pressure, said pressure responsive means being adapted to react, in use, to inhalation by the user of the apparatus to tilt the stem of the valve and thereby permit the flow of breathing gas through the valve to the user. The invention also resides, in a third aspect, in breathing apparatus comprising a source of pressurised breathing gas, a demand regulator according to the second defined aspect of the invention of which the inlet port is communicable with said gas source, and breathing interface means for oormnunication with said second chamber of the demand regulator.The invention will now be more particularly described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a front elevation of a demand regulator for use in breathing apparatus and which includes a tilt valve in accordance with the invention Figure 2 is a sectional side elevation of the regulator of Figure 1 andFigure 3 is a sectional plan view of a second demand regulator including a tilt valve in accordance with the invention, designed particularly for underwater use. Referring to Figures 1 and 2, the demand regulator illustrated therein has a plastics casing 1 that is of cup shape and opens at its base into a standard tubular connector 2 for coupling the device into the mask of a breathing apparatus. A diaphragm 3 of synthetic rubber extends across the mouth of the cup shape casing 1 and is sandwiched around its peripheral margin between the rim of the casing 1 and the rim of a plastics cover 4. An encircling clamping ring 5 urges the cover 4 onto the casing 1 so as to establish and maintain a peripheral gas seal between the diaphragm 3 and the casing 1. The cover 4 is perforated, having in particular a large central aperture 6, so that the diaphragm 3 is exposed within the cover 4 to ambient atmospheric pressure.Reduction of pressure within the casing 1 accompanying each inhalation by the mask wearer during breathing, will accordingly deflect the diaphragm 3 inwardly of the casing 1. Deflection of the diaphragm 3 inwardly of the casing 1 acts via a tilt valve 7 to regulate admission of breathing gas to the casing 1 and thence through the connector 2 into the mask. The gas, normally an air oxygen mixture, is supplied from a source, normally a highpressure bottle, that is coupled to the regulator via a hollow threaded spigot 8. The spigot 8 extends sideways from a cylindrical metal housing 9 of the tilt valve 7 that is coupled into the wall of the casing 1 via a rotatable gas tight joint 10. The spigot 8 opens within the housing 9 through an inlet port 11 into a cylindrical bore 12 that is closed at its end remote from the casing 1 by a screw plug 13. A metal insert 14, which is a gas tight push fit in the opposite end of the bore 12, has a hollow frusto conical projection 15 that projects past the port 11 in the bore 12 to provide a seating for the head 16 of the tilt valve 7. The head 16 seats on the top rim of the projection 15 over the opening 17 of a frusto conical bore 18 that extends through the insert 14. The progressively widening outlet passageway provided from the outlet opening 17 by the bore 18 is continued from the bottom of the bore 12 in a frusto conical bore 19 of the housing 9 that opens into the casing 1. A metal stem 20 of the valve head 16 extends from the head 16 through the opening 17 and into the casing 1 to lie adjacent to the central region of the diaphragm 3. The pressure of gas supplied via the inlet port 11 to the closed valve chamber in the bore 12 urges the head 16 firmly onto its seating to block the outlet opening 17 while there is no deflection of the diaphragm 3. However each deflection of the diaphragm 3 inwardly of the casing 1 in response to inhalation within the mask tilts the stem 20. This tilts the head 16 away from the rim of the projection 15 allowing passage of gas from the valve chamber through the outlet opening 17 into the casing 1 to meet the breathing needs of the mask wearer. The head 16 of the tilt valve 7 is a close fit within the bore 12 and has rounded edges 21 to enable it to be tilted easily against the wall of the bore in regulating flow through the outlet opening 17.The inlet port 11 is located to the same side of the head 16 as the opening 17 so gas admitted into the valve chamber provided by the bore 12 is not required to pass between the periphery of the head 16 and the surrounding wall of the valve chamber in order to reach the outlet opening 17. The head 16 can therefore be as close a fit in the bore 12 as desirable to ensure that it remains with the same seating throughout operation it being required to provide a clearance between these components sufficient only to permit the transmission of the inlet gas pressure to the closed space 22 on the opposite side of the head 16, rather than admitting the full flow of gas which passes through the valve to keep the valve head seated when the diaphragm 3 is undeflected. The head 16 6 is preferably a moulding of polytetrafluorethylene but may be of nylon to provide for self lubricating, and therefore low friction, rubbing on the wall of the bore 12 and also reduction in the likelihood of sticking of the valve under conditions of icing the stem 20 of the valve may in these circunstan s be simply a metal rod forced into the head moulding and retained frictionally. The demand regulator described may be coupled to a high pressure gas bottle without the necessity for an intermediate first stage pressure reducing valve upstream of the regulator. In this respect the divergent outlet passageway defined by the aligned frusto conical bores 18 and 19 provides for a gradual expansion of the gas as it enters into the casing 1. The central aperture 6 in the cover 4 is large enough to enable the mask wearer to insert a finger and push the diaphragm 3 inwardly for the purpose of opening the tilt valve 7 by way of testing or admission of extra volume of gas. Turning now to Figure 3, the regulator illustrated therein is designed particularly for use with self contained underwater breathing apparatus and ccopnses a casing 31 having a lateral limb 32 to which is coupled a tilt valve 33 of identical construction to the valve 7 described above in relation to Figures 1 and 2. Description of the tilt valve will accordingly not be repeated in this respect. In the embodiment of Figure 3 the central limb 34 of the casing 31 is coupled to a moulded mouthpiece 35 through which breathing gas passed from the tilt valve can be supplied to a diver and through which exhaled gas can be received back fran the diver. The diaphragm 36 in this case is laterally offset from the centre line of the casing and is sandwiched around its peripheral margin between the casing and a perforate cover 37. The diaphragm respond to the difference between the ambient water pressure within cover 37 and the gas pressure within casing 31 when the diver inhales, by deflecting and tilting the stem 38 and head 39 of the valve 33 to supply breathing gas in accordance with the needs of the diver, in the same manner as described above in relation to Figures 1 and 2. The diaphragm also incorporates an exhalation valve comprising a perforate plate 40 and an elastsmeric flap 41 secured centrally together by a fastener 42, which opens to vent exhaled gas to the surrounding environment when the pressure produced within the casing 31 upon exhalation exceeds the ambient pressure by a predetermined value.
