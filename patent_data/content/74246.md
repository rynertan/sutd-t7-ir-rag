# Blow moulded bottle shaped container of biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate and piece to be blow moulded into the same bottleshaped container.

## Abstract
A hollow blow molded bottle shaped container of a biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate which advan tageously has a stepped portion 4 formed on the inner peripheral surface of a boundary between a neck portion 1 integrally formed with a shoulder portion 2 with a body portion 3 and the shoulder portion 2 and crystallized by a heat treatment before being biaxially oriented blow molded from an injection molded primary piece or parison P , thereby abruptly reducing the thickness of the wall at the boundary from the neck portion 1 to the shoulder portion 2 to substantially equal to the thickness of the body portion 3 . This bottle shaped container is manufactured from a preformed piece or parison P injection moulded in which a recess groove is formed on the peripheral surface of the shoulder portion forming portion 2a . Thus, the deteriora tion in the physical properties of the neck portion and shoulder portion of the bottle shaped container can be eliminated.
