## Description
COMPACT RACK FOR STORING USED NUCLEAR FUEL ASSEMBLIESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a compact rack for storing used nuclear fuel assemblies and particularly to a compact rack with a high and uniform neutron absorption and a high corrosion resistance. Used nuclear fuel assemblies withdrawn from a nuclear reactor in a nuclear power plant are stored in a pure water pool until it is reprocessed. Recently an improvement has been attempted to shorten the stored fuel distance to effectively utilize the space of the pool for storing the used fuel assemblies. A rack encasing a plurality of unit square cylinders based on such a concept is called a compact rack, which will be hereinafter referred to merely as rack ,Las shown in Fig. 1, where the conventional rack encasing 30 square cylinders is illustrated. The requirements for the rack are 1 uniform neutron absorption, 2 high corrosion resistance, and 3 high strength. The conventional square cylinder as a rack unit is made from austenite stainless steel, whose 2 neutron absorption is as small as about 3.2 cm 100 g. On the otherhand it has been proposed to make square cylinders from a composite plate of B4C and Al, whose 2 neutron absorption is as high as 775 cm 100 g, but the composite plate itself is brittle and is difficult to bend and also poor in corrosion resistance. Furthermore it has been tried to add boron to stainless steel to increase the neutron absorption and to make square cylinders from such material, where 7.1 by atom of boron is added to stainless steel to obtain a neutron absorption of 66 cm2 100 g. However, the rolling property of the material is deteriorated above 7.1 by atom of boron and no practical square cylinders are obtained. To solve the problem, it has been tried to use a material obtained by pulverizing and sintering stainless steel containing boron, but a binding property of powders themselves is poor and the strength is not satisfactory. In view of the processability, the upper limit is 19.4 by atom of boron. Vken stainless steel containing no boron are mixed and sintered, the stainless steel powder containing no boron works so effectively that the overall boron content can be increased up to 34 by atom. However the resulting material contains particles containing boron and particles containing no boron as bonded together, and thus has still such a problem as microscopically uneven neutron absorption due to the segregation of boron. The various materials for square cylinders so far proposed as above have a poor corrosion resistance and thus undergo corrosion when in direct contact with pure water. Thus, these neutron absorber materials are used in such a square cylinder structure as shown in Fig. 2 A and B , where a square cylinder comprises an inner cylinder 1 of austenite stainless steel and an outer cylinder 3 of austenite stainless steel, and a neutron absorber material 2 is sealed into between the inner cylinder and the outer cylinder by welding so that the neutron absorber material can be prevented from direct contact with pure water. However, the neutron absorber material is sealed therebetween in that case, and when boron turns a helium gas by neutron irradiation, the square cylinder is liable to expand thereby, and there is a problem of failure to withdraw a fuel assembly from the square cylinder.Furthermore, the square cylinder has a larger thickness and the aim to make the rack compact cannot be attained.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a compact rack for storing used nuclear fuel assemblies having a high and uniform neutron absorption, a high corrosion resistance and a small cross sectional area. The said object can be attained in the present invention by a compact rack for storing used fuel assemblies encasing a plurality of unit square cylinders for encasing used nuclear fuel assemblies, which comprises the unit square cylinders being square cylinders, each comprised of an inner cylinder and stripes of neutron absorber material wound up around the inner cylinder, and square cylinders, each comprised of only an inner cylinder, the wound cylinders and the non wound cylinders being arranged alternately in both lateral and longitudinal directions, or the unit square cylinders, each comprised of an inner cylinder and thin stripes of neutron absorber material overlaid at least on one pair of opposite outer sides of the inner cylinder, and so arranged that the overlaid sides of one square cylinder faces the unoverlaid sides of another square cylinder, or the unit square cylinders each having thin stripes of neutron absorber material at one side of the inner cylinder and being so arranged that the thin stripes of neutron adsorber material surround the inner cylinders, and furthermore preferably the neutron absorber material is a nickel based alloy containing 10 30 by atom of B, 5 25 by atom of Cr and 1 15 by atom of P and at least 30 by atom of Ni having a pitting corrosion potential of at least 0.9 V,Furthermore the neutron absorber material is preferably substantially amorphous, andycontajnl5 l8 by atom ofB, 12 20 by atom of Cr, 3 12 by atom of P, the balance being Ni and contingent impurities, or rray contain B, Cr and P, and not more than 25 by atom of Fe, not more than 10 by atom of at least one of Mo, W, Ti, Nb and V, the balance being not less than 30 by atom of Ni, where preferably the neutron absorber material contains 15 18 by atom of B, 12 20 by atom of Cr, and 3 12 by atom of P.

Fig. 11 is a plan view showing another arrangement of the square cylinders shown in Fig. 9 in a rack according to the present invention.PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, an amorphous neutron absorber material containing boron as a neutron absorbing element to a maximum with a good corrosion resistance even in direct contact with pure wter is used as a material for the square cylinder.That is, in the present invention, a nickel based amorphous alloy containing B, Cr and P and having a pitting corrosion potential of at least 0.9 V as a neutron absorber material is used as a material for the square cylinder. It is necessary for the nickelbased alloy for use in the present invention to have a toughness capable of tight bending of at least 900, particularly preferably of 1800. To obtain such toughness, it is preferable to utilize a molten metalquenching method as used in the production of amorphous alloy. It is not always necessary that the alloy is 100 amorphous, but is preferable that it is rather completely amosphous. Generally, boron, when added to steel or nickel in an amount above 9.2 by atom, embrittles the product with a failure of further processing. In the present invention, a molten metal containing boron subjected to ultra rapid quenching and solidification at a cooling speed of about 103 1060C sec to increase the boron content to a very high neutron absorption and to obtain an amorphous product. The amorphous product is in a thin stripe, 20 30 ijm in thickness, having a high strength and high toughness, and the boron is uniformly distributed in the thin stripe. The method for producing such amorphous material includes, for example, a method comprising inserting a molten raw materials having a predetermined composition into a nozzle made from quartz or the like, remelting the raw materials by a heater, injecting the molten raw materials into between two rotating rolls at a high speed by a high pressure argon gas and quenching and solidifying the injected raw materials at a rate of about 103 1060C sec, thereby obtaining an amorphous product alloy in a ribbon form. The amorphous alloy can be obtained from raw materials containing iron, nickel and cobalt as base metals and further containing 20 30 by atom of phosphorus, boron, silicon, carbon, etc. in total as amorphous phase forming elements on the basis of the total alloy. A typical system of anti corrosive amorphous alloys is a system of Fe P C Cr, which is however very poor in neutron absorption owing to absence of boron therein. Thus, nickel is preferred as a more corrosion resistant.metal to iron for the base metal for corrosion resistant amorphous alloys containing boron. The corrosion resistance of semi metals is poorer in the order of phosphorus, carbon, boron and silicon, and thus phosphorus and boron are preferred as amorphous phase forming elements. Zones for forming an amorphous phase and corrosion resistance in a Ni P B system further containing chromium as a corrosion resistance enhancing element, i.e. a Ni P B Cr system and that further containingFe, i.e. a Ni P B Cr Fe are investigated. In Fig. 3 an amorphous phase forming zone of a Ni P B Cr15 Fe 10 20 system containing 15 by atom of Cr and 10 20 by atom of Fe is shown, where the circle mark shows the amorphous phase, the square mark shows a mixture of the amorphous phase and the crystalline phase, and the triangle mark shows the crystalline phase. As is obvious from Fig. 3, a maximum phosphorus content can be obtained at the boron content of 17.5 by atom, and the amorphous phase can be obtained even at the boron content of 25 by atom.Thus, to increase the neutron absorption, it is preferable to use an amorphous alloy containing a higher boron content, but the amorphous alloy must be corrosionresistant even when it comes into direct contact with pure water with the view of making the rack more compact. In Fig. 4, changes in pitting corrosion resistance of a Ni P2.5 3.5 B Cr15 Fe12 system with a varying boron content in an aqueous 3 NaCl solution at 200c are shown. As is obvious from Fig. 4 the pitting corrosion resistance is decreased with increasing boron content, that is, the corrosion resistance becomes poorer. In Fig. 5, changes in pitting corrosion potential of a Ni P B175 Cr15 Fe system with varying phosphorus content are shown. In contrast to boron, phosphorus is a corrosion resistance enhancing element, and thus the pitting corrosion resistance is increased with increasing phosphorus content, and the pitting corrosion potential is 1.0 V above the phosphorus content of about 3.5 by atom. In Fig. 6 changes in pitting corrosion potential of a Ni P3.5 B17.5 Cr Fe15 system with varying Cr content as a corrosion resistance enhancing element are shown.The pitting corrosion potential is low at the chromium content of 5 by atom, which is not effective, but above the chromium content of about 10 by atom, it is 0.8 V or higher. In Fig. 7, changes in pitting corrosion potential of a Ni P3 BL Cr15 Fe system with varying iron content are shown, where the addition of iron has an aim of increasing the strength. As is obvious fromFig. 7, the pitting corrosion potential is not changed even by addition of iron up to 30 by atom. Table 1 shows results of crevice corrosion tests substantially identical with the actual circumstances, where test square cylinders, each having a onefourth size of the actual square cylinder 164 mm x 164 mm x 6 mm thick were wound up with thin stripes of neutron absorber materials and dipped in pure water at 850C for 10,000 hours and occurrence of crevice corrosion between the thin stripes was investigated. Sample Nos. 1 7 were tested to observe the influence of phosphorus, Sample Nos. 8 .17 that of boron, SampleNos. 12 16 that of chromium, and Sample Nos. 17 22 that of iron, where the circle mark shows no occurrence of corrosion and the triangle mark occurrence of partial corrosion. In the tests the pitting corrosion potential was determined from current potential curves obtained by using a potentiostat HA 104 made by Hokuto DenkoK.K., Japan , a silver chloride reference electrode in an aqueous 3 NaCl solution as a corrosion test solution, and a logarithmic converter HG 101 made byHokuto Denko K.K. Japan at a potential scanning speed of 3 x 103 sec V.

To increase the neutron absorption it is preferable to increase the boron content, but as is obvious fromTable 1 partial corrosion occurs at or above 20 by atom of boron, and thus 18 by atom of boron or less is preferable. At the chromium content of 10 by atom of chromium, partial corrosion occurs, but at or above 12 by atom, no corrosion occurs. No corrosion occurs at an iron content of O 25 by atom. In Table 1, the tensile strength was determined by Amsler tensile testing machine, and the tensile strength is increased with increasing iron content. This is preferable when thin stripes are wound up around a square cylinder under tension. As a result of pitting corrosion potential measurement and crevice corrosion tests, it is obvious that no crevice corrosion occurs at least at a pitting corrosion potential of about 0.9 V. Thus, to maintain a pitting corrosion potential at least at 0.9 V and an alloy in an amorphous phase, it is desirable that an amorphous alloy for the neutron absorption contains 3 12 by atom of P, 15 18 by atom of B, and 12 20 by atom of Cr, and 0 25 by atom of Fe, the balance being Ni and contingent impurities. That is, corrosion takes place below 3 by atom of P, whereas no amorphous phase is obtained above 12 by atom of P. No amorphous phase is obtained below 15 by atom of B, whereas corrosion takes place above 18 by atom of B. Corrosion takes place below 12 by atom of Cr, whereas no amorphous phase is obtained above 20 by atom of Cr.No amorphous phase is obtained above 25 by atom of Fe, and thus 0 25 by atom of Fe is preferable. The neutron absorber amorphous alloy for use in the present rack can contain at least one of Mo,W, Ti, Nb and V in addition to P, B, Cr, and Fe. Table 2 shows the effect of adding Mo, W,Ti, Nb or V to a Ni P B Cr Fe system. Testing procedures and evaluation are the same as given in Table 1.As is obvious from Table 2, Sample Nos. 1 5 have pitting corrosion potentials of more than 0.9 V and no corrosion takes place. Further addition of highly neutron absorptive elements such as Gd, Sm, Eu, Rh, Cd, In, Zr, Hf, Ir, etc. to those shown in Table 2 can increase the neutron absorption of the neutron absorber material. In that case, it is preferable that Hf is in an amount of not more than 15 by atom, and other elements are in an amount of not more than 5 by atom alone or in combination. Table 3 shows properties of stainless steelSUS 304 and the amorphous alloys for use in the present invention as a neutron absorber material. Stainless steel SUS 304 has a pitting corrosion potential of 0.3 V. An amorphous material of Ni55P5325Cr15 at. Containing 25 by atom of boron has a neutron absorption of 225 cm2 100 g but has a low pitting corrosion potential and thus undergoes partial corrosion.on the other hand, an amorphous alloy of Ni46P6B18Cr15Fe15 at. for use in the present invention has a lower neutron absorption than that containing 25 by atom of boron, but has a higher pitting corrosion potential, and thus undergoes no corrosion.

If the wrapping thickness is less than 1 mm, the fuel in the square cylinders cannot be kept in a noncritical state, and the distance between the square cylinders must be made larger and no higher compactness of the rack will be obtained than by the zero crevices.In other words, no highly compact rack cannot be provided. In Fig. 9, another embodiment of the unit square cylinder for use in the present rack is shown, where the thin stripes 2 of the said neutron absorber material are overlaid on only a pair of opposite outsides of a stainless steel square cylinder 1 to a thickness of about 1 mm, and bands 5 are provided on the overlaid stripes 2 and spot welded at points 6. Various welding methods are available, but spot welding is preferred when thin stripes of amorphous material are secured by welding, because the amorphous material is sensitive to heat for example, crystallization takes place at about 4500C, making itself brittle , and the ordinary welding makes the amorphous material brittle due to the heat influence. Only if any device is to be made to prevent the thin stripes of amorphous material from the heat influence, the ordinary welding can be applied. The stripes of amorphous neutron absorber material can be overlaid on only one side of a square cylinder, or all the outsides of a square cylinder, and equivalent corrosion resistance can be of course obtained in these cases. Fig. 10 shows a structure of a rack that unit square cylinders 12 each comprised of an inner cylinder and thin stripes of an amorphous neutron absorber material wound up around the inner cylinder as shown inFig. 8 and unit square cylinders 11 each comprised only of an inner cylinder without winding up the thin stripes of the amorphous neutron absorber material are arranged alternately in both lateral and longitudinal direction in a rack frame 14 through spacers 13, whereby practical shielding effect of neutron absorption can be obtained with the minimum use of neutron absorber material. Fig. 11 shows another structure of a rack that unit square cylinders each having thin stripes of amorphous neutron absorber material overlaid only on a pair of opposite outer sides of an inner cylinder are so arranged that the overlaid sides of one square cylinder faces the unoverlaid sides of another square cylinder, where numeral 22 shows the overlaid sides, numeral 21 the unoverlaid sides, numeral 23 spacers and numeral 24 a rack. According to the present invention, the unit square cylinder is comprised of an inner cylinder wound up with the thin stripes of amorphous neutron absorber material around the inner cylinder or overlaid with the sheets of amorphous neutron absorber material at least on a pair of opposite outer sides of the inner cylinder and thus requires no outer cylinder around the amorphous neutron absorber material. The amorphous neutron absorber material for use in the presnet invention usually has a high strength and a high toughness and also an amorphous thin ribbon like form, and thus the neutron absorption of the present rack can be increased by using unit square cylinders each provided with the spirally wound or overlaid stripes of such amorphous neutron absorber material at the outer sides of the cylinder. The arrangement of the unit square cylinders in a rack as shown in Figs. 10 and 11 can maintain the used nuclear fuel in a non critical state without any crevices. As described above, the present rack has a high neutron absorption and a high corrosion resistance, and thus has such advantages as 1 the used nuclear fuel can be maintained in a non critical state only by providing the amorphous neutron absorber material at the outer sides of unit square cylinders constituting a rack for storing the used nuclear fuel assemblies from a nuclear reactor, 2 it is not necessary to make the unit square cylinders with the neutron absorber material from outer cylinders and inner cylinders and thus the unit square cylinders can be made smaller in size, simpler in fabrication, and lighter in weight. For example, the storing capacity of the present rack of the same volume can be increased by about 25 as compared with the conventional rack with the unit square cylinders comprised of outer and inner cylinders. 3 The present rack has a high corrosion resistance and has a life of over 40 years.
