# LOOM

## Abstract
A loom is provided with a member 196 movable together with a reed 5 and formed with a guide space 197 through which a weft yarn 10 projected from a weft inserting nozzle 17 is picked into the shed of warp yarns 2 . An air flow passage 196a is provided to merge in the guide space in such a manner that the weft yarn lying in the guide space is forced into the air flow passage to be removed under the influence of air stream developed through the guide space, thereby surely removing a mispicked weft yarn from the warp shed.
