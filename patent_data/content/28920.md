# A method for the preparation of a wrapped yarn and its use to form fabrics.

## Abstract
A wrapped yarn, a method for the preparation thereof and its use to form fabrics. A wrapped core yarn comprising a core 10 composed of fibres so arranged that the core 10 has substantially zero tensile strength and a plurality of wrapper yarns 30,36 wrap ped under tension in both the clockwise and the counter clockwise directions around said core 10 whereby the yarns 30,36 periodically cross over one another, the tension on the wrapper yarns 30,36 being so high as to compress said core 10 in areas where said wrapper yarns 30,36 cross over one another, are made by continuously wrapping a plurality of wrapper yarns 30,36 in both the clockwise and counter clockwise directions about a core 10 of staple fibres arranged in the above manner, causing the wrapper yarns 30,36 to cross over one another periodically during the wrapping step and applying to the wrapper yarns 30,36 during the wrapping step a tension so high as to compress said core in areas where said wrapper yarns 30,36 cross over one another. The yarn has extreme softness, high tensile strength and good properties of knitability, weavability and processability such that a wide variety of desirable fabrics may be formed therefrom. For example, a fabric consisting essentially of staple fibres may be made by utilizing as the wrapper yarns, removable yarns which may be removed by dissolving or melting.
