# Semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
An improved semiconductor memory device is pro vided, which has i a first gate electrode 6 in an electrically floating state, at least a part of which confronts a channel region of a semiconductor device and which is separated by an insulating layer 5 from the channel region ii a second gate electrode 8 , i.e., a control electrode , at least a part of which confronts the first gate electrode 6 and is separated by an insulating layer 7 from the first gate electrode 6 and iii a third gate electrode 10 i.e., an erasing electrode , at least a part of which confronts the first gate electrode 6 and is separated by an insulating layer 9 from the first gate electrode 6 . The insulating layer 9 , separating at least a part of the erasing electrode 10 from the first gate electrode 6 , has a thickness usually 50 to 300 Ã… sufficient to allow the passage of charges from the first gate electrode 6 to the erasing electrode 10 through the tunneling effect, thereby discharging the first gate electrode 6 .
