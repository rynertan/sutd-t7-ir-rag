# Apparatus for eliminating metallic contaminations from a fibre transporting duct in spinning preparation.

## Abstract
An apparatus for eliminating metallic contaminations from a fibre transporting duct 1 in spinning preparation, wherein an air stream transports fibre flocks through the duct. At a branching point 2 of the fibre transporting duct 1 leading to a waste duct 3 there is pivotably arranged deflecting means 7, 7 operatively connected with and activated by a drive mechanism 13 . The deflecting means 13 are activated in response to the passage of a metallic object through a section of the fibre transporting duct surrounded by a metal detector 14 arranged upstream of the branching point 2 , by means of a control device 17 connected with a power source 19 and the drive mechanism 13 . Within a short time the deflecting means 7, 7 can be shifted from an idle position, where the transporting duct 1 is open and the waste duct 3 is maintained closed, into a working position, in which the transporting duct is closed and the waste duct is maintained open.
