# An electrolytic cell having a composite electrode membrane structure.

## Abstract
A novel electrolytic cell for the electrolysis of aqueous solutions of alkali metal chlorides which comprises a cell housing containing a pair of electrodes of opposite polarity. A hydraulically impermeable ion exchange membrane is posi tioned between and separates the pair of electrodes. At least one of the electrodes comprises a reticulate electrode where the reticulate electrode is in contact with the membrane. Means are provided for applying an electric potential to the electrodes. The reticulate electrode in contact with the hydraulically impermeable membrane forms a composite structure which substantially eliminates the gap between the electrode and the membrane. Employing the novel electrolytic cells for the electrolysis of alkali metal halide solutions results in reduced cell voltages and electrical power consumption. The reticulate electrodes used allow significant reductions in material costs and have increased surface area.
