# Optically achromatized acoustooptic deflection apparatus.

## Abstract
An optically achromatized acoustooptic deflection apparatus. Acoustooptic deflectors scan light through a scan angle which is a direct function of wavelength. In multicolor systems, the scan angles must be equalized. According to the invention, equalization is accomplished by one prism 26 or more prisms which magnify the scan angles by an amount which is an inverse function of the specific wavelengths involved. At least two beams are passed through the same prism so that the beams do not have to be separated to equalize the scan angles. The prism can also provide separation of the beams for insertion of optical elements in separate beams.
