## Description
Printed Circuit Board Structure for Metal Package Containing Hi9h Frequency Component This invention relates to a printed circuit board structure and, more. particularly, to a printed circuit board structure suitable for mounting a package containing high frequency components, such as surface accoustic wave SAW devices. These components are usually hermetically sealed in a metal package to increase the reliability. The metal package containing an SAW device as a filter, or a resonator, for example, must be high frequency grounded in order to gain a desired high frequency characteristic. In a prior art grounding structure, the metal package is pressed upon conductive patterns on a printed circuit board with a conductive spring plate. This structure, however, is not desirable because it requires a large space and the characteristics of a high frequency component will deteriorate by contact resistances between the metal package and the conductive patterns and between the metal package and the spring plate. In another prior art structure, a package and conductive patterns are soldered at several points. But this structure causes difficulties in replacing and mounting works and further, the space required for soldering becomes a dead space. In a still another conventional structure, lead wires are soldered to through holes of a printed board while a package is being pressed on conductive patterns.Working is slightly improved in this case, but the problem about high frequency characteristics remains because there is still a possibility for insufficient contact.Summary of the Invention It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a printed circuit board structure for high frequency components which is capable of improving characteristics of the high frequency components contained in a metal package. Another object of the present invention is to provide a printed circuit board structure wherein the mounting area for a metal package which contains high frequency components can be minimized. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a printed circuit board structure having improved performance for mounting and replacement of a metal package which houses high frequency components. Still further object of the present invention is to provide a printed circuit board structure which is suitable for a metal package containing a band pass filter BPF including an SAW device. According to the present invention, there is provided a printed circuit board structure mounting a metal package with a circuit component for useinahigh frequency region contained therein, the structure comprising a grounding hole bored partially in an area of the printed circuit board under the metal package and means for connecting the metal package with conductors on the printed circuit board via the grounding hole.Brief Description of the Drawings The above and other features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the description given hereinbelow referring to the accompanying drawings, in which s Fig. 1 is a schematic circuit diagram of a highfrequency amplifier whose output is connected to a band pass filter including an SAW devices Fig. 2 is a perspective view for explaining the principle of a filter employing an SAW device Fig. 3 is a partially exploded perspective view of a metal package hermetically housing the filter of the SAW device shown in Fig. 2 Fig. 4 is a bottom view of the printed circuit board structure according to the present invention Fig. 5 is an enlarged cross section taken along the line A O B of Fig. 4 Figs. 6A and 6B show another embodiment of the present invention, indicating respectively the printed circuit board viewed from the bottom and from the top side thereof Fig. 7 is a graph showing frequency characteristic exhibited when a BPF is mounted on the printed circuit board having no through hole for grounding, which is referred to as grounding hole hereinafter and Fig. 8 is a graph showing frequency characteristics exhibited when a BPF is mounted on a printed circuit board having a grounding hole according to the present invention.Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment In Fig. 1, a signal IN applied to an input terminal 1 is amplified by a transistor Q, removed of undesired wave components by a band pass filter BPF 3, and outputed from an output terminal 2 as an output signal OUT.Resistors N and RC are to apply a DC bias from a DC power source V to the transistor Q. A coil L is a high cc frequency choke coil and a capacitor C is for high frequency by pass. The BPF 3 includes an SAW device. In Fig. 2, the SAW device filter comprises comb like electrodes 22 formed on a piezoelectric substrate 21 of LiT,03 or LiNbO3 The comb like electrodes 22 are connected to input terminals 23, 24 and output terminals 25, 26.When an electromagnetic wave is applied to the input terminals 23 and 24, a surface wave W is generated by piezoelectric effect and is transmitted to the output terminals 25 and 26. The transfer characteristic of the surface wave W is determined by spatial interval h,0between comb like electrodes 22, the number of pairs or the shape of the electrodes 22, so that SAW device filters having various frequency characteristics can be achieved. In Fig. 3, the filter shown in Fig. 2 is hermetically sealed in a metal package 31 of TO 5, for example. The input output terminals 23, 24 and 25 26 are respectively connected to lead wires 33, 34 and 35, 36. The figure schematically shows the state of the SAW device 21 in the package 31. In actual dimension for 450 MHz band, the package 31 is 9.1 mm in diameter, and 4.0 mm in height the interval between lead wires 33 and 34, 33 and 35, and 35 and 36 is 3.6 mm and the substrate 21 is 4.0 mm in length and 3.0 mm in width. In Fig. 4, the input output conductive patterns 41, 42 are respectively connected to through holes 43, 46.Other through holes 44, 45 and a grounding hole 47, which is a feature of this invention, are connected to a ground conductive pattern 48. The grounding hole 47 bored in an area of a printed circuit board 51 See Fig. 5 on which the BPF package 31 is mounted, as marked with a phantom line one dot chain . The BPF package is positioned on the side opposing to the conductive patterns 41, 42, and 48 on the printed circuit board 51. In Fig. 5, the bottom surface of the BPF package 31 and the ground pattern 48 of the printed circuit board 51 are soldered or brazed 52 through the grounding hole 47.Lead wires 53, 54 from the package 31 are respectively inserted into corresponding through holes 43, 44 and soldered 55, 56 . Since the diameter of the grounding hole 47 is made sufficiently larger than that of the through holes 43 through 46, undesired capacitance or inductance between the package 31 and the ground pattern 48 can be minimized. This contributes to greatly improving the frequency characteristic of the BPF, which will be explained later in more detail. Since the area required for mounting the package 31 on the printed circuit board 51 is limited to the bottom surface of the package, the mounting area becomes conveniently smaller than those needed for mounting with a spring plate or mounting by soldering on periphery of the package.The package 31 can be mounted on the printed circuit board 51 simply by inserting lead wires respectively into through holes and soldering them with automatic soldering or flow soldering. The performance for mounting and replacement of the package can, therefore, be greatly improved. In Fig. 6A, the pattern viewed from the bottom side of a printed circuit board is identical with the embodiment shown in Fig. 4. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 6B, on the side where components are mounted and around the through holes 43, 46, there is provided an area from which conductive patterns are removed. Around the grounding hole 47 further is provided an area 61 from which resist alone is removed. The rest of the surface 63 is covered with resist. As mentioned above, by applying resist suitably on the surface, the solder which might flow from the grounding hole 47 can be limited within the area 61 where no resist is applied. This can prevent the input output lead wires from being grounded erroneously. The replacement of the package can further be facilitated. The frequency characteristics of BPF shown in Fig. 7 are obtained when a package is mounted on a printed circuit board by soldering a TO 5 type metal package containing an SAW device to lead wires while pressing the same. ThisBPF is designed to have a center frequency Fo at 458.5 MHz and 6 dB band width B of 10 MHz attenuate signals in a frequency band ATT image frequency which is tuned apart from the in band frequency by 42.8 MHz to the negative side. The size of the package is the same as the one described in reference to Fig. 3. In Fig. 8, the frequency characteristics of BPF are obtained when a printed circuit board structure shown in Figs. 4 and 5 is used but the metal package is the same as the one used for Fig. 7. The diameter of the grounding hole 47 is set at about 2 mm. The center frequency FQ, 6 dB band width B and the image frequency band widthATT are the same as the ones shown in Fig. 7, respectively.As obvious from Figs. 7 and 8, the BPF mounted on the printed circuit board structure according to this invention is superior to the BPF of Fig. 7 by about 10 dB in out band attenuation ATT . It will be readily understood that similar effect can be achieved for metal packages accommodating transistors,ICs or components or circuits other than SAW device filters.
