# Optical scanning apparatus.

## Abstract
Optical scanning apparatus for scanning a light beam 2 across a photosensitive surface 12 . The scanner 6 is of the rotating polygon type, and has a positive cylinder mirror 10 located between the polygon scanner 6 and the photosensi tive surface 12 . The positive cylinder mirror, which has power in the sagittal cross scan plane but no power in the tangential scan plane, minimizes scan to scan spot position errors due to angular alignment errors between adjacent facets 4 of the polygon scanner without introducing significant sagittal field curvature. Residual sagittal field curvature is compensated for by providing a negative refractive cylinder lens 14 , with power in the sagittal plane, between the cylindrical mirror 10 and the polygon scanner 6 .
