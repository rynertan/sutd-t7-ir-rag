## Description
SELECTIVE FORMATION OF ETHANOL FROM METHANOL, HYDROGEN AND CARBON MONOXIDE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention Ethanol is a compound which has been used by man since time immemorial. Historically, ethanol has been produced for various purposes by the fermentation of comnon grains. However, within recent years synthetic processes have been developed to synthesize this alcohol for industrial use Such synthetic processes permit the use of more economical starting nateria ss than those used in the feriEntation processes, and additionally, permit production and reproduction of a more standardized product and more easily prffdictable yields of end product.Methanol can easily and economically be produced in great quantities from hydrogen and carbon monoxide or from almost anything containing carbon and hydrogen, for ex ample from methane to manure and from coal to crude oil residues. One such process for producing ethanol synthetically involves reacting methanol with carbon monoxide and hydrogen at elevated temperatures and pressures in the presence of a catalyst system. The conversion of an alcohol, for example, methanol, to the primary alcohol containing one carbon atom mdre than the original alcohol, namely ethanol, is normally a tedious and time consuming procedure involving a series of steps.Additionally, catalysts which possess acceptable activity generally tend to give a wide spectrum of products, in addition to ethanol, for example, hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons having a broad distribution of carbon atoms. This not only complicates the separation and recovery of desired products, but results in reduced yield of ethanol and erosion of reactants in the production of undesirable by products.2. Description of the Prior Art The reaction of methanol with hydrogen and carbon monoxide to produce ethanol is appreciated and disclosed by the prior art. However, in general, most known processes produce an undesirably large mixture of alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids in addition to the desired alcohol. For example, U. S. Patent No. 3,285,948, entitledHALIDES OF RUTHENIUM AND OSMIUM IN CONJUNSTIONS WITH COBALTAND IODINE IN THE PRODUCTION OF ETHANOL FROM METHANOL issued to Butter on November 15,1966 , teaches a method for producing alcohols in which any source of cobalt soluble in the reaction medium which will yield a cobalt carbonyl or hydrogen cobalt carbonyl under the reaction conditions ca n be used. In addition, an iodine promoter is employed, for example I2, or alkali metal iodines. A secondary promoter is also employed, i.e., ruthenium halide or osmium halide. High selectivity is described as better when the secondary promoter is used in combination with the primary promoter and other rectants. U. S. Patent No. 4,013,700m entiled CATALYTIC PROCESSFOR POLYHYDRIC ALCOHOLS AND DERIVATIVES, issued to Cawse onMarch 22, 1977, disclOses a process fo r the preparation of polyhydric alcohols, their ether and ester derivatives, and oligomers of such alcohols. In particular, these alcohols and their derivatives are produced by reacting the oxides of carbon and hydrogen in the presence of a quaternarg phos phonium cation and a rhodium carbonyl complex at elevated temperature and pressure. Another process is set forth in U.S. Patent No.3,248,432, entitled PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ETHYLALCOHOL, issued to Riley et al on April 26, 1966, which relates to a process for the production of ethyl alcohol by the interaction of methanol, carbon manoxide and hydrogen at elevated temperature and pressure in the presence of a cobalt catalyst and an iodine promoter. Examples of.suitable cobalt sources are described as any water soluble source of cobalt, for example, the cobalt carbonyls, the lower salts of alkanoate cobalt, such as cobalt acetate, cobalt formate, cobalt propionate, and the like. U.S. Patent No. 2,623,906, entitled PREPARATION OFORGANIC HYDROXY CONTAINING COMPOUNDS BY REACTING ALCOHOLSWITH CARBON MONOXIDE AND HYDROGEN, issued to Gresham onDecember 30, 1952, relates to a procedure for synthesizing mono and poly functional oxygen containing organic compounds by the reaction of alcohols, carbon monoxide and hydrogen.Catalysts described as suitable for use include various cobalt compounds, for example, cobalt carbonyl, cobalt car bonyl hydride, metallic cobalt, and organic and inorganic cobalt salts. The process, however, suffers from the disadvantage of poor product distribution. Dutch Patent No. 760,6138 entitled PROCESS FOR. THEFORMATION OF ETHANOL FROM METHANOL AND SYNTHESIS GAS, issued to Shell International Research on June 8, 1976, relates to a process for producing alcohols which utilizes any soluble cobalt source which can generate a cobalt carbonyl or hydro carbonyl by reaction with the synthesis gas. For example, sources of cobalt suitable for use are cobalt iodide or cobalt metal from which ions can be generated in situ. Org n ic salts of cobalt such as cobalt acetate, formate, or propionate are described as especially good sources, an iodide or bromide promoter is als utilized. In addition, the use of a tertiary phosphine iE described as affording improved selectivity to the formatin of alcohols. Unexpectedly, we have discovered that not all cobalt and ruthenium sources alone give similar results that is, produce a product containing a large amount of ethanol with a minimum amount of other products. Generally, catalysts which possess excellent activity, generally, tend to give a wide spectrum of products, for example, hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbpns having a product distribution of varying carbon atoms content. This not only complicates the recovery of desired products, but results in the wastage of reactants to commercially uninteresting by products. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a process for the selective homologation of methanol to ethanol wherein methanol is reacted with hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the presence of a catalyst, the improvement which comprises contacting methanol, hydrogen and carbon monoxide with a catalyst system comprising a source of cobalt, which under the reaction conditions will generate a hydrido cobalt carbonyl complex, such as cobalt acetylacetonate, a tertiary organo Group V A compound of the Periodic Table of the formula EMI4.1 wherein E is a member selected from the group consisting of trivalent phosphorus, trivalent arsenic and trivalent antimony and R1, R2 and R3 are either alike or different members selected from the group consisting of saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched chain alkyl radicals having from about 1 to about 24 carbon atoms, preferably from about 1 to about 10 carbon atoms aryl radicals having from about 6 to about 20 carbon atoms, preferably from about 6 to about 10 carbon atoms alkenyl radicals having from about 1 to about 30 carbon atoms, preferably from about 1 to about 20 carbon atoms cycloalkyl radicals having from about 3 to about 40 carbon atoms, preferably from about 3 to about 30 carbon atoms aralkyl and alkaryl radicals having from about 6 to about 40 carbon atoms preferably from about 6 to about 30 carbon atoms and n is an integer of 0 or 1 with the provision that when n is 1, E must be phosphorus an iodine promoter and as a second promoter a ruthenium compound. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention resides in a process for the homologation of methanol to ethanol which comprises contacting methanol, hydrogen and carbon monoxide with a catalyst system comprising a source of cobalt, which under the reaction conditions will generate a hydrido cobalt carbonyl complex, such as cobalt acetylacetonate, a tertiary organo Group V A compound of the periodic table, an iodine promoter and as a second promoter a ruthenium compound under reaction conditions for a time period sufficient to produce said ethanol.Although hydrogen and carbon monoxide are employed herein for reaction with methanol to produce ethanol, it is understood that any combination of compounds that will form hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the reaction zone can also be used, for example, mixtures of hydrogen any carbon dioxide, water and carbon monoxide, etc. The mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide used herein can be produced from anything containing carbon and hydrogen. Two types of reactions, for example, can be used for the production of synthesis gas, partial oxidation and steam reforming. Steam reforming is the more important process when natural gas methane is the hydrogen carbon source.Partial oxidation is used primarily for heavy fuel and residue. The relative amounts of hydrogen and carbon monoxide present in the reaction mixture can be varied over a wide. r however, in general, the molar ratio range of hydrogen to carbon monoxide is from about 10 1 to about 1 10, es specially from about 3 1 to about 1 3 however, conventional gas mixtures o hydrogen and carbon monoxide with a molar ratio of about 1 1 is convenient and satj factory for the process herein. It is to be noted that molar ratios outside the aforestated ratio ranges can be employed herein and as pointed out hereinabove compounds or reaction mixtures which give rise to the formation of carbon monoxide and hydrogen under the reaction conditions defined herein can be used instead of mixtures comprising hydrogen and carbon monoxide which are used in the preferred embodiments of this invention. In a preferred mode, methanol, hydrogen and carbon monoxide are introduced into a pressure resistant reaction vessel, for example, a stainless steel autoclave with agitation means. Agitation is defined herein as shaking, rocking, stirring, percolation with synthesis gas, etc. Methanol can be converted into ethanol in a batch operation or in a continuous process. When the batch method is used, methanol, hydrogen and carbon monoxide, the desired cobalt source, a tertiary organo Group V A compound of the periodic table, iodine promoter and a ruthenium compound are introduced into the reaction vessel and the pressure and temperature are adjusted to the operating reaction conditions.If the system is a closed system, the pressure is raised to the desired level with hydrogen and carbon monoxide before the reaction is initiated and the pressure falls as the reaction proceeds, but never below reaction pressure. Alternatively, the system can be equipped with a reservoir which contains synthesis gas and which feeds said gas to the reaction vessel at a set pressure on demand, thus maintaining a particular pressure level. In a continuous process for producing ethanol, methanol, hydrogen and carbon monoxide, the desired cobalt sourcé, a tertiary organo Group V A compound of the periodic table, an iodine promoter and a ruthenium compound are continuously fed into a pressure resistant reaction vessel as described herein at a constant rate. The cobalt source and pr AotetFs are normally dissolved in an inert solvent, for example, ethylene glycol, 1,2 dimethyl ethane, or acetone, before intirbiluction into the reaction vessel for ease of applicatioAd recovery of the cobalt compound and promoters.The mixture of methanol, synthesis gas, cobalt source, a tertiary organo Group V A compound of the periodic table, iodine promoter and ruthenium compound is next reacted under reaction conditions f6r a time period sufficient to convert methanol to ethanol. Pressures which are suitable for use in our process, for example, generally are above about 1000 psig 6.83 MPa , but should not be in excess of about 10,000 psig 68.30 MPa .An especially desirable pressure range is from about 1000 psig 6.83 MPa to about 6000 psig 40.98 MPa , preferably from about 2000 psig 13.66 MPa to about 5000 psig 34.15 MPa . Temperatures which are suitable for use in our process are those temperatures which initiate a reaction between the reactants herein to produce ethanol, generally from about 15O0C. to about 2500C., preferably from about 1750C. to about 225 C. The reaction is conducted for a time period sufficient to convert methanol to ethanol, normally from about 0.5 hour to about 10 hours, especially from about 1 hour to about 5 hours. Recovery of the desired ethanol from the reaction product can be effected in any convenient or conventional manner, for example, by distillation. At ambient pressure and about 210C,, the components will distill off in the following sequence for the desired recovery dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, methyl acetate, methanol and ethanol. It is to be noted that the catalyst system herein is highly selective to the formation of ethanol and minimizes the formation of undesirable by products such as acetaldehyde, ethers, esters and other alcohol derivatives. Any source of cobalt, which under the reaction conditions will generate a hydrido cobalt carbonyl complex, can be used to produce ethanol from the above reactants, namely, methanol, hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Examples of the cobalt compounds that can be used as the desirable cobalt source herein include cobalt acetylacetone, cobalt tricarbonyl complexes, such as triphenyl phosphine cobalt tricarbonyl dimer, tri n butyl phosphine cobalt tricarbonyl dimer, triphenyl arsine cobalt tricarbonyl dimer, tri para tolyl arsine cobalt tricarbonyl dimer, triphenyl antimony cobalt tricarbonyl dimer, cobalt carbonyl, cobalt acetate, cobalt oxide, etc. Generally, the molar concentration of the cobalt source to methanol is from about 1 1 to about 1 100,000, especially from about 1 1 to about 1 2,000. Tertiary organo Group V A compounds of the periodic table which are suitable for use as ligands herein are of the formula EMI7.1 wherein E is a member selected from the group consisting of tritalent phosphorus, trivalent arsenicand trivalent . anti mony and R1, R2 and R3 are either alike or different members selected from the group consisting of saturated or unsatured straight or branched chain alkyl radicals having from about 1 to about 24 carbon atoms, preferably from about 1 to about 10 carbon atoms aryl radicals having from about 6 to about 20 carbon atoms, preferably from about 6 to about 10 carbon atoms alkenyl radicals having from about 1 to about 30 carbon atoms, preferably from about 1 to about 20 carbon atoms cycloalkyl radicale having from about 3 to about 40 carbon atoms, preferably from about 3 to about 30 carbon atoms aralkyl and alkaryl radicals having from about 6 to about 50 carbon atoms, preferably from about 6 to about 30 carbon atoms and n is an integer of 0 or 1 with the provision that when n is 1, E must be phosphorus. Tertiary organo Group V A compounds which are suitable for use herein include tr i methyl pho sphi te tri ethyl phosphine tri n butyl phosphine tri isopropyl phosphine tri cyclo hexyl phosphite tri cyclo hexyl phosphine tri cycio heptyl phosphine di phenyl methyl phosphine tri phenyl pho sphine tri naphthyl phosphine tri styryl phosphine vinyl diphenyl phosphine tri benzyl phosphite tri benzyl phosphine tri para tolyl phosphite tri para tolyl phosphine tri ethyl arsine tri n butyl arsine tri isopropyl arsine tri cyclo hexyl arsine tri cyclo heptyl arsine di phenyl methyl arsine tri phenyl arsine tri naphthyl arsine tri styryl arsine vinyl diphenyl arsine tri benzyl arsizie tri para tolyl arsine tri ethyl antimony tri n butyl antimony tri isopropyl antimony tri cyclo hexyl antimony tri cyclo heptyl antimony di phenyl methyl antimony tri phenyl antimony tri naphthyl antimony tri styryl antimony vinyl diphenyl antimony tri benzyl antimony, and tri para tolyl antimony, or mixtures thereof.It should be noted that the tertiary organo Groups A compounds herein are superior in the combined selectivity to formation of C2 products, including ethanol. Normally, the cobalt source and the tertiary organo Group V A compound used are in a molar ratio of from about 1 20 to about 20 1 especially from about 1 1 to about 6 1. Any source of iodine which is capable of disassoci ating. that is, ionizing to form free iodide ions, in the reaction medium can be used as a primary promoter in the present invention. Illustrative examples of iodine promoters especially suitable for use are preferably members selected from the group consisting of iodine, pbtassium iodide, calcium iodide, sodium iodide, lithium iodide, hydrogen iodide, methyl iodide, ethyl iodide, and the like. Normally, the cobalt source and the iodine promoter herein are mixed in a molar ratio range of from about 1 100 to about 100 1, preferably from about 1 10 to about 10 1, respectively. The second promoter of the present invention is preferably a ruthenium compound, and is employed in the reaction medium under reaction conditions in catalytically effective amounts. Preferably, the cobalt source and ruthenium compound are used in a molar ratio of from about 1 20 to about 20 1, especially from about 3 0.19 to about 3 1.5, preferably from about 3 0.19 to about 3 0.75. It should be noted that the cobalt source, tertiary organo Group V A compound, iodine promoter and ruthenium compound combination herein, is highly selective to ethanol formation when contacted with methanol, hydrogen and carbon monoxide under reaction conditions.It should additionally be noted that when the above molar ratio of cobalt source to tertiary organo Group V A compound is above about 3 1.5 or below about 3 0.19, the reaction is still selective to the formation of ethanol, however, lower yields of ethanol are obtained. Ruthenium compounds which are suitable for use herein include rutheniumacetylacetonate, ruthenium trichloride, ruthenium tribromide, ruthenium triiodide, ruthenium acetate, ruthenium propionate, ruthenium octonate, ruthenium dioxide, ruthenium tetraoxide, ruthenium pentacarbonyl and triruthenium dodecacarbonyl.

The system was then heated to a temperature of about 2000C. and the pressure was adjusted to a working pressure of about 4000 psig 27v6 MPa .The reaction wits allowed to proceed for approximately three hours, after which the reactor was cooled by an internal cooling coil to about 750C. The reactor was vented through a dry gas meter, a gas sample was taken for a mass spectral analysis, and the liquid product was analyzed using a Model 900 PerkinsElmer gas chromatograph utilizing a 16 ft. 4.88 meters x 1 8 in. 0.32 centimeter stainless steel column wherein 8 ft. 2.44 meters of the column was packed with 80 100 meshPoropak Q and the other 8 ft. 2.44 meters was packed with 80 100 Poropak R. The gas chromatograph was programmed to increase from 400. to 1900C. at a rate of 32 C. min. and with a helium flòw rate at 30 cc. min. An analysis indicated that 61.3 per cent of the methanol was converted with the following mole per cent selectivity Compound Selectivity, Mole Ethanol 51.7 Acetadehyde 13.0 Dimethyl Ether 3.9 Diethyl Ether 4.0 Methyl Acetate 12.4 Unknown 15.0 From the above data, it is readily apparent that the triphenyl arsine cobalt tricarbonyl dimer in combination with iodine and ruthenium acetylacetonate gives excellent selectivity in the conversion of methanol to ethanol in a single step. It is to be noted that any of the trivalent antimony and trivalent phosphorus cobalt tricarbonyl compounds herein can be substituted for the triphenyl arsine cobalt tricarbonyl above, any of the iodine promoters herein can be substituted for the iodine above, and any of the ruthenium compounds can be substituted for the ruthenium acetylacetonate above with substantially the same results.
