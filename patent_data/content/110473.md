# Apparatus for dispensing wet wipes.

## Abstract
The invention pertains to a seal for dispensing wet wipes from a container comprising a tube of generally ta pered form having a relatively wide mouth 10 for receiving wipes and a relatively narrow orifice 11 for dispensing them, the tube being divided circumferentially into rela tively rigid 13 and relatively flexible 14 axially extending zones, so that when a wet wipe 12 is dispensed the orifice is capable of expansion. The seal according to the invention provides good dis pensing action and prevents to a significant extent evapo ration of the impregnated liquid.
