## Description
COMPLEMENTARY NPN AND PNP LATERAL TRANSISTORS SEPARATED FROM SUBSTRATE BYINTERSECTING SLOTS FILLED WITH SUBSTRATE OXIDE FOR MINIMAL INTERFERENCE THEREFROM AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING SAME Fjled of the Invention This invention is a novel structure and method for forming submicron type lateral dielectrically isolated complementary transistors utilizing VLSI chip processing steps to compatibly fabricate hundreds of such devices, simultaneously on a common functional chip. Background of the Invention Techniques extracted from the prior art come from the field of sub micron fabrication technology wherein the dimensional resolution is now comparable to or even smaller than the thicknesses of the thermally grown silicon oxide layers on silicon. Also, the dimen sions are now comparable or even smaller than the base widths used for fused transistors, i.e., 0.4 to 1.0 micrometers. From these techniques, the novel structure and method for the complementary lateral transistors with greatly reduced parasitic capacitances and resistances are achieved. Summary of the Invention The invention comprises novel lateral complementary transistors formed on a selectively doped substrate by intersecting slots and orthogonal slots for respectively defining each active region undercut by selective intersecting slots and filled with substrate oxide to isolate the effective regions from the substrate. Prior to oxidation filling the orthogonal slots, selective doping is introduced by angle implantation from opposed orthogonal surfaces of each individual active region to complete the NPN formations or the complementary PNP formations. The intersecting slots and the orthogonal slots of the complementary devices are respectively orthogonally related, Electrical connections are made in conventional fashion to become emitter, base and collector regions.

Brief Description of a Preferred Embodiment of the Invention In the devices produced in accordance with the present invention, the effects of the substrate are minimized relative to the operation of the devices. It should be realized that the isolated active region may be completely contained within a surface area of approximately 5d x 3d 15d2 wherein d is only 0.4 micrometers. Each active region is completely separated from the substrate by substrate oxidation and the parasitic capacitances and resistances are almost completely reduced to a minimum value attainable because the transistors are reduced to just their electronically active regions. In the conventional vertical transistor, the electrically active region is only a very small fraction of the total transistor area or volume.The dielectric isolation between transistors offered by the substrate oxidation has advantages with respect to high frequency performance, high voltage integrated circuits, radiation resistance, and circuit flexibility, i.e., the process provides NPN and PNP devices on the same integrated circuit chip. In Figure 1, the chip or die is partly shown at 1 carrying an NPN formation of transistors structures 2 and a separate PNP formation of transistor structures 3. In formation 2, a pair of intersecting slots 4 and 5 form triangular shaped active regions 6 and 7 separated by orthogonal slots 8 and 9. The arrows 10 and 11 illustrate the angle doping paths when tilted upwardly for N or N doping of the underlying substrate. Subsequently, slots 8 and 9 are also filled with oxide and electrical connections are established to the electrode regions of the isolated active transistor regions. In formation 3, the intersecting slots 12 and 13 of the P region are illustrated orthogonal to intersecting slots 4 and 5 of the N region 2, and the directions of angled doping, shown by arrows 14 and 15, is at right angles to arrows 10 and 11 of region 2. Since ion milling and ion doping are preferably employed, many regions, such as 2 and 3, may be selectively distributed across the chip 1, and accu rately indexed by present day conventional techniques. This offers versatility of association of the complementary transistors. Use of the ullistrated orthogonal relationship of slots 8 and 9 to slots 101 iand 102 serves to prevent contaminating of doping i.e. N type doping is only injected at right angles to P type doping. Referring now to Figure 2, substrate 21 is masked by photoresist 23 which is patterned to define the penetration regions for inter setting slots 25 and 26. Since substrate 21 As shown doped N or P type, the intermediate region 27 will eventually comprise a plurality of transistors of either the NPN or PNP type, having been carved from the substrate by the slots 25 and 26. To prevent intermediate region 27, better defined as a semi array of transistor regions, from falling into substrate 21, it should be noted that the slots 25 and 26 are Interrupted to leave shoulders at spaced apart intervals therealong, best seen at 31, 32 and 33 in Fig. 5. Since the preferred way of forming slots 25 and 26 is by ion milling, shown by the flux lines 37 in Fig. 2, the masking layer 23 is a material with a low sputtering rate, such as one of the heavier metals. Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the ease of forming intersecting slots, such as 25 and 26,simply by orienting the substrate at angles, e.g., 600 to the horizontal, such that the ion flux 37 may remain in its vertical pattern to form, first slots 26, and thereafter slots 25 simply by rotating the substrate 21 through 900. The flux may be accurately directed to any region 2 or 3. While the triangular array 27 is shown as being substantially equilateral, it need not be and the angles may be varied to configure the active regions as desired for specific purposes, It will also be noticed from Figs. 3 and 4 that slots 25 and 26 terminate where they intersect because extending them deeper into the substrate would serve no purpose. From Fig. 5, It may be seen that the slots 25 and 26 may be intermittent such that supporting ribs or webs 31, 32 and 31 , 32 serve to support each semi array 27. These webs or supports may be at spaced apart locations along the slots 25 and 26 or merely comprise only supports at the edges of the chips because they serve but a temporary purpose as the slots will be filled with substrate oxide to provide the permanent support for each transistor region. The first oxidation step is shown in Fig. 6 wherein silicon oxide 25 and 26 fills the respective slots 25 and 26. Also, an upper layer of silicon oxide 28 Fig. 6 covers the upper surface and is continguous with the silicon oxide 25 and 26 such that semi array 27 is totally isolated from the substrate 21 by the silicon oxide, and the periphery of the semi arrays 27 are sub stantially covered by the oxide. In Fig. 7, orthogonal slots 41 divide the semi arrays 27 into the individual transistor regions 27 and provide ingress for the doping to follow. Thus, each orthogonal slots 41 includes sidewalls 41 through which individual transistor regions 27 will be doped.The other sidewalls 41 of slots 41 provide for doping adjacent transistor regions 27 . Slots 41 may be ion milled using the masking technique heretofore employed. Consequently, photoresist 43 Fig. 8 of a heavier metal is patterned as shown in Fig. 8 to provide for ion milling slots 41 via the openings 45 in the heavy photoresist 43 and silicon oxide layer 42. The ion flux is illustrated by the lines 46. In Fig. 8A, it may be seen that the Ns regions 31 and 33 are implanted by fon implanting at an angle as illustrated by the ion I beams 32 and 34. It is important to note that the angle of the ion beams relative to the slot directions is such that the N implanting does not extend to the full depth of the slots 23 and 25. Actually the corners of the silicon oxide layer 42 form a shadowing effect and cooperate with the orientation of the beams 3o and 34 in fixing the N doped regions within the P active region 27. Phosphor or other donors may be employed in this step. Dotted lines 31 and 33 show that the doping has been driven in and the N regions 31 and 33 considerably enlarged.This may be accomplished through the applicant tion of heat over a controlled period of time and temperature. In Figure 9, an individual transistor region 27 is shown comprise ing N or Ns doped region 51, P or P doped region 52 and N or N doped region 53. The P region 52 is the base region and comprises a portion of the original substrate 21, e.g,, doped P.at formation 2 in Fig. 1. However, both N regions 51 and 53 are provided by doping region 27 via the sidewalls 41 and 41 of orthogonal slots 41 Fig. 7 with phosphorous deposition, diffusion or implantation plus driven to create the emitter region 51 and the collector region 53. Thereafter, the structure of Fig. 9 is oxidized to fill in slots 41 with silicon oxide 54 and provide covering layer 51. The next step in the process is illustrated in Fig. 10 wherein the silicon oxide layer 51 has been patterned to leave oxide islands 55 and metallization applied to comprise the emitter electrode 71, base electrode 72 and collector electrode 73. However, prior to applying the metallization, a light boron deposit may be made in the base region 52 to provide the P base spanning region 75, if desired. The purpose of the boron deposition 75 prior to the metallization is two fold, i.e., first to reduce the base region contact resistance and second to produce a potential barrler Pf that will deflect the electrons in transit across the base regions 52 away from the base contact. Finally, a PNP device can be built utilizing a P type substrate in the manner of having built the NPN device starting from a P substrate as described in region 3 Fig. 1. This is shown in Fig. 11 wherein emitter region 85 is conventionally P doped, but by angled ion flux via the slots 101, 102 Fig. 1 just as in the process for the NPN transistors. Collector region 86 is similarly formed, and base region 87 is part of the original N doped substrate 3 Fig. 1 . Patterning of the silicon oxide on the top of this complementary device has been shown and it is only necessary to lay down the metallization pattern for electrical connection to the various transistor regions. Interconnections of the complementary transistors may be es tablished using conventional diffused lines, poly lines or metal patterning. It should be mentioned that the N and P formations need not be at right angles but this arrangement insures that ion doping is carried out most efficiently and there are no components of doping intended for NPN transistors which dope the complementary PNP transistors.This orientation facilitates higher speed and more efficient processing. The dielectrically isolated complementary transistors of this invention have no junction curvature and thus exhibit higher break down voltages. Also, they exhibit very low capacitances, t.e., Ccb, Cbe, and Ccs, Similarly, bulk resistance is very low l.e. rbb , rcc and ree . Syn netrical transistors are readily available with very low VCE at 1c 0. Also available is high g at low current levels L IMA , with no current crowding at the higher current levels. By the use of oversize geometry, close control oyer transistor parameters is possible with respect to the absolute values, and more importantly, the matching tolerances, partly due to the excellent control available with respect to base width since it is now a function of lateral geometry and not of the small differences of two diffusion as in conventional double diffused transistors.
