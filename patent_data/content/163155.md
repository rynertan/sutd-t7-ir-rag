# Low temperature fired ceramics.

## Abstract
Low temperature fired ceramics produced by firing at a low temperature a mixture consisting of, in weight percen tages a 50 to 65 of powder glass consisting of 10 to 55 of CaO, 45 to 70 of SiO₂, O to 30 of A1₂ O₃ and up to 10 of impurities and b 50 to 35 of powder A1₂ C₃ containing up to 10 of impurities. The glass component a may further contains B₂ O₃ up to 20 based on the total weight of the former glass forming components. The ceramics exhibit excellent thermal conduc tivity, high mechanical strength, low thermal expansion and small dielectric constant and such advantageous combina tion of properties make them useful in many applications, more especially highly suited to the use as substrate of various electronic parts, components or multilayer inte grated circuits. Also, since the ceramics can be prepared at lower firing temperatures and a higher heating rate, the production cost and time can be advantageously saved.
