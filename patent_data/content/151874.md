# Prepayment metering system.

## Abstract
This invention concerns a prepayment metering system using a card on which information may be stored and from which stored information may be erased. In one form, a number A recorded on the card is read at the meter and stored 30 in preparation for the next card insertion. To obtain a further credit at the meter, the card is taken to a terminal station 12 at which the number A recorded on the card is read and is subjected to an encryption process under the control of a key and the resulting number A is recorded on the card in place of the previous number A . On the next insertion of the card at the meter 21 , the number A is read from the card and subjected to a decryption step 22 using the same key, the result of the decryption being compared with the number stored in the register 30 and in the event of a match a credit is issued. In another embodiment, the terminal generates a random number which is subjected to encryption and both the random number and the result of the encryption are recorded on the card and subsequently used at the meter.
