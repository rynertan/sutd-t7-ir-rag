# Ventilated cigarette.

## Abstract
A filter cigarette has a wrapper 12 surrounding the filter 11 and retaining it on the end of the tobacco rod, and at least one portion 13 of the wrapper overlying the filter and extending circumferentially at least partly round the cigarette at a distance from the mouth end is delimited by a line or lines of weakness 14 in the wrapper and is at least partly removable to expose a portion of the surface of the filter, whereby ventilating air can pass beneath the wrapper to reach the mouth end of the cigarette.
