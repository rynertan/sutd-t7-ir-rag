# Method and device for image analysis.

## Abstract
A device for image analysis comprising means 1 for producing a video signal indicative of the light intensity received at successive regular time intervals from an image scanned along a first direction at an automatically controlled known motion velocity and along a second direction at an unknown motion velocity, characterized in that it further comprises means 2,5 for determining a reference contrast value from the difference between light intensities received from points of the image scanned along said first direction, means 3,6 for determining a variable contrast value from the difference between light intensities received from points of the image scanned along said second direction, means 7 for comparing said variable contrast value with said refer ence contrast value, and means 8,10 for using said comparison for compensating for said unknown motion a velocity in the production of the video signal.
