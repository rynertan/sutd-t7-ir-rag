Polyether urethane foams that are heat laminatable are prepared by incorporating within the foam an effective amount of an organophosphorus additive. This organophos phorus additive can be an organophosphite, an organophos phonate, an organophosphate, and a mixture thereof. This foam can also include an halogenated flame retardant.
