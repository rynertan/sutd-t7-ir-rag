# IMPROVED DATA STORAGE CARDS

## Abstract
A data storage card 10 has an aperture 13 for receiving a photographic image. The aperture 13 has an adhesive border 14 which is protected by a disposable sheet 15 having release characteristics. One edge of the sheet extends outwardly to form a flap 16 overlying the card. For example by bending the card, the flap 16 can easily be separated from the card and a knife edge 31 inserted to strip the sheet from the card. Suitable apparatus causes bending as the card is passed manually or automatic ally along a path which includes a suitably placed knife edge.
