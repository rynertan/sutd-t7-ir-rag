# Scrambling systems for audio frequency signals.

## Abstract
In a scrambling system for an audio frequency signal, an audio signal is divided into blocks, each block being formed of a plurality of frames f3, f4 , the frames f3, f4 g1, g2 are re arranged on a time base in a predetermined order within every block so as to be encoded, and the encoded signal is re arranged on the time base in the original order so as to be decoded. A first signal processing circuit 15, 16 inserts a redundant portion r1, r2 between adjoining frames g1, g2 and time base compresses the frames g1, g2 upon encoding, a control signal generating circuit 21 inserts a control signal CL into the redundant portions r1, r2 , a control signal detecting circuit 37 detects the control signal CL upon decoding, and a second signal processing circuit 32, 33 removes the redundant portions r1, r2 and time base expands the frames g2, g2 .
