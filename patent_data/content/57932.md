## Description
TITLE Antiinflammatory and or Analgesic 3,4 Dihydro or l,4 Dihydro 2 E substituted thio El benzopyrano 3,4 d imidazoles and Their Corresponding Sulfoxides and Sulfones Field of Invention This invention relates to benzopyranoimidazoles, their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and methods of using them to treat inflammation and or pain in mammals. More particularly, this invention relates to antiinflammatory and or analgesic 3,4 dihydro or l,4 dihydro 2 L substi tuted thio l benzopyranot3,4 d imidazoles and their corresponding sulfoxides and sulfones.Pribr Art U.S. Patent 4,198,421, issued April 15, 1980, toSaul C. Cherkofsky and Thomas R. Sharpe, describes antiinflammatory 2 substituted dibenzoC2,3 6,7Joxe pinoE4,5 d imidazoles of the formula EMI1.1 where n is 0, 1 or 2 R1 is CF3 or CF2CF2H R2 is a variety of groups including H X1 and Y1 are independently H, C1, F, dimethylamino or C1 C2 alkoxy and X2 and Y2 are independently H, F or C1 provided at least one of X1, X2, Y1 or Y2 is other than H. D. Huckle et al., J. Med. Chem., 12 3 , 277 79 1969 describe the synthesis of a compound of the formula EMI2.1 However, no biological activity is reported for this compound or compounds of related structure. There is a continuing need for safe and effective antiinflammatory agents. Inflammation is a disease process characterized by redness, fever, swelling, and pain. Arthritis, in its various forms, is the most prevalent, chronic and severe of the inflammatory diseases. Traumatic injury and infection also involve inflammation, and antiinflammatory drugs are often used in their treatment. The usefulness of most commercial antiinflammatories is limited because of toxicity and adverse side effects. Many produce gastric irritation and other effects, such as changes in blood cells and central nervous system. Adrenocortical steroids produce gastric irritation and suppression of normal adrenal function. The present invention results from efforts to develop new anti arthritic compounds with good antiinflammatory activity and minimal side effects that could be more effective in treating arthritis than presently available drugs. In addition to antiinflammatory properties, some compounds of this invention have demonstrated analgesic activity in a test procedure. This additional property is desirable in treatment of arthritis or related diseases however, such compounds can be employed solely to alleviate pain.

The appropriate R1 group can be introduced by alkylating the 3,4 dihydro or 1, 4 dihydro l benzo pyrano 3,4 dzimidazole 2 thiols with a suitable alkylating agent such as ethyl iodide or 2,2,2 trifluoroethyl trichloromethanesulfonate. Also, the 3,4 dihydro or 1 ,4 dihydro l benzopyrano 3, 4 d imidazole 2 thiols can be reacted with tetrafluoroethylene to provide 2 l,l, 2,2 tetrafluoroethyl thio derivatives.Similar addition reactions of tetrafluoroethylene and other fluorinated olefins are described in England,D. C. et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 82, 5116 1960 andRapp, K. E., et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 72, 3642 1950 . For the purpose of this disclosure tetrafluoroethylene and other fluorinated olefins used are considered alkylating agents. Compounds where R1 CF3 are preferably prepared by irradiating a mixture of the thiol and trifluoromethyl iodide as alkylating agent in liquid ammonia. An inert solvent suchas ether, tetrahydrofuran or the like is usually added in order to have a homogeneous solution. The 3,4 dihydro or 1,4 dihydro 2 t substi tuted thio l benzopyrano 3,4 d imidazoles can then be oxidized to the corresponding sulfoxides or sulfones by using oxidizing agents such as m chloroperbenzoic acid, Tweit, R.C., et al., J.

U.S.S.R., 25, 2289 1955 , or potassium permanganate, Rapp, K.E., et al., loc. cit. Compounds of Formula Ia or Ib of this invention with R2 other than H can be prepared by alkylation, acylation or sulfonylation of the corresponding compounds with R2 H. These reactions can be conducted in the presence or absence of a base, such as potassium carbonate, pyridine, triethylamine, potassium t butoxide, sodium hydride and the like. Examples of alkylating, acylating and sulfonylating agents capable of introducing other R2 groups are methyl iodide, 2 chlorotetrahydrofuran, 4 nitrobenzyl chloride, acetic anhydride, acetyl chloride, ethyl chloroformate, benzoyl chloride and benzenesulfonyl chloride and the like. Generally, a halide of an appropriateR2 group, preferably a chloride, is used to introduce the R2 group other than hydrogen. In the following examples, temperatures are in degrees centigrade.

They can be administered by any conventional means available for use in conjunction with pharmaceuticals either as individual therapeutic agents or in a combination of therapeutic agents.They can be administered alone, but are generally administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The dosage administered will, of course, vary depending upon known factors such as the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent, and its mode and route of administration age, health, and weight of the recipient nature and extent of symptoms, kind of concurrent treatment, frequency of treatment, and the effect desired. Usually a daily dosage of active ingredient can be about 0.1 to 100 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. Ordinarily 0.5 to 50, and preferably 1 to 25 milligrams per kilogram per day given in divided doses 1 to 6 times a day or in sustained release form is effective to obtain desired results. Dosage forms compositions suitable for inter nal administration contain from about 1 milligram to about 500 milligrams of active ingredient per unit. In these pharmaceutical compositions the active ingre dient will ordinarily be present in an amount of about 0.5 95 by weight based on the total weight of the composition. The active ingredient can be administered orally in solid dosage forms, such as capsules, tablets, and powders, or in liquid dosage forms, such as elixirs, syrups, and suspensions, it can also be administered parenterally, in sterile liquid dosage forms. Gelatin capsules contain the active ingredient and powdered carriers, such as lactose, sucrose, mannitol, starch1 cellulose derivatives, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and the like. Similar diluents can be used to make compressed tablets. Both tablets and capsules can be manufactured as sustained release products to provide for continuous release of medication over a period of hours. Compressed tablets can be sugar coated or film coated to mask any unpleasant taste and protect the tablet from the atmosphere, or enteric coated for selective disintegration in the gastrointestinal tract. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration can contain coloring and flavoring to increase patient acceptance. In general, water, a suitable oil, saline, aqueous dextrose glucose , and related sugar solutions and glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols are suitable carriers for parenteral solutions. Solutions for parenteral administration contain preferably a water soluble salt of the active ingredient, suitable stabilizing agents, and if necessary, buffer substances. Antioxidizing agents such as sodium bisulfite, sodium sulfite, or ascorbic acid either alone or combined are suitable stabilizing agents. Also used are citric acid and its salts and sodium EDTA. In addition parenteral solutions can contain preservatives, such as benzalkonium chloride, methyl or propyl paraben, and chlorobutanol. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences, E. W. Martin, a standard reference text in this field. Useful pharmaceutical dosage forms for administration of the compounds of this invention can be illustrated as follows Capsules A large number of unit capsules are prepared by filling standard two piece hard gelatin capsules each with 75 milligrams of powdered active ingredient, 150 milligrams of lactose, 24 milligrams of talc, and 6 milligrams magnesium stearate. Soft Gelatin Capsules A mixture of active ingredient in soybean oil is prepared and injected by means of a positive displacement pump into gelatin to form soft gelatin capsules containing 75 milligrams of the active ingredient.The capsules are washed in petroleum ether and dried. Tablets A large number of tablets are prepared by conventional procedures so that the dosage unit is 75 milligrams of active ingredient, 6 milligrams of magnesium stearate, 70 milligrams of microcrystalline cellulose, 11 milligrams of cornstarch and 200 milligrams of lactose. Appropriate coatings may be applied to increase palatability or delay absorption. Injectable A parenteral composition suitable for administration by injection is prepared by stirring 1.5 by weight of active ingredient in 10 by volume propylene glycol and water. The solution is sterilized by commonly used techniques. Suspension An aqueous suspension is prepared for oral administration so that each 5 milliliters contain 25 milligrams of finely divided active ingredient, 200 milligrams of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, 5 milligrams of sodium benzoate, 1.0 grams of sorbitol solution, U.S.P., and 0.025 milliliters of vanillin. Injectable A parenteral composition suitable for administration by injection is prepared by dissolving 1 by weight of active ingredient in sodium chloride injection U.S.P. XX and adjusting the pH of the solution to between 6 and 7. The solution is sterilized by commonly. used techniques. Use To detect and compare the antiinflammatory activities of compounds in this series and standard drugs, a test was used based on a standard model of arthritis for which there is good correlation with human efficacy. The model is adjuvant induced arthritis in rats. Federation Proceedings, Vol. 32, No. 2, 1973 Models Used for the Study and Therapy of RheumatoidArthritis Symposium of the American Society forPharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics states The rat polyarthritis produced by intradermal injection of a suspension of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in mineral oil adjuvant has been used extensively for the screening of drugs of potential use in rheumatoid arthritis. Established Adjuvant Induced Arthritis in Rats Charles River Lewis male rats 130 150 grams are injected subcutaneously in the plantar area of the right hind paw with 0.1 ml of adjuvant Difco heatkilled, lyophilized Mycobacterium butyricum suspended in mineral oil 5 mg ml . 20 Non arthritic controls are injected with mineral oil. The animals are held for 2 weeks to allow development of arthritis.Paw volumes uninjected, left hind paw are measured and the adjuvant injected rats are culled and distributed to treatment groups of 10 of equal disease severity.Non arthritic controls are distributed to 2 groups of 10. The rats are given oral doses of compound orPVA Acacia Polyvinyl Alcohol 1 , Gum acacia, U.S.P.5 , Methylparaben 0.5 10 ml kg by gavage on that day and on the 6 following days. One day after the last dose the paw volumes uninjected, left hind paw are measured using a Ugo Basile Volume DifferentialMeter Model 7101. Arthritic Control Treatment Group Mean Paw Volume ml Mean Paw Volume ml X 100 Arthritic Control Non Arthritic Control Mean Paw Volume ml Mean Paw Volume ml Decrease from Control Mean Paw Volume. Dose response regression lines of the percent decrease are plotted on semi log paper by visual fit and the ED5O decrease from control paw volume is determined by inspection. Data for some of the compounds of this invention are summarized in Table V. Compounds from this series were also compared to indomethacin, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, and aspirin. Phenylquinone Writhing Test A standard procedure for detecting and comparing the analgesic activity of compounds in this series for which there is a good correlation with human efficacy is the standard phenylquinone writhing test modified from Siegmund, et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., 95, 729 1957 . A test compound suspended in 1 methylcellulose was given orally to fasted 17 21 hours female white mice, 5 20 animals per double blind test. Aqueous 0.01 phenyl p benzoquinone phenylquinone, 0.20 ml per mouse, was injected intraperitoneally 6 minutes before observations were begun. At an appropriate time after the oral administration of the test compound, the mice were observed for 10 minutes for a characteristic stretching or writhing syndrome which is indicative of pain induced buy phenylquinone.The effective analgesic dose for 50 of the mice ED50 was calculated by the moving average method of Thompson, W. R., Bact. Rev., 11, 115 145 1947 the time of peak activity was determined for many of the compounds. Data for some of the compounds are summarized in Table V together with data for some standard analgetic antiinflammatory drugs.
