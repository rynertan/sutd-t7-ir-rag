# PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS AND DEVICE FOR PUTTING INTO PRACTICE

## Abstract
In a procedure for obtaining electronic Circuits there is a base board of electro insulating type, to whose surfaces, in the correctly faced position, two sheets, preferably of paper, are fixed the said sheets bear drawings for the practical electronic circuit which is required, with the location and identification of its components. The said drawings are obtained by means of an original and a carbon copy thereof, so that they are fully symmetrical, so that they can be seen and easily identified from either of the two faces of the base board. In a second operational phase, this assembly is perforated in order to establish the coupling points for the tabs for the different electronic components, such as transis tors, condensers, resistors, diodes, integrated circuits or similar elements, which are retained adapted to the board by any standard means, e.g. by the support thereon of a spongy body to allow the assembly to be inverted then, following the cutting of the tabs to the desired length, making the connections in accordance with the drawing on the board, with the assistance of a conductor wire which is wound on to the corresponding tabs of the two components to bei connected, simultaneously acting as a means of connection between the said components, and as physical element of attachment of the said components to the board.
