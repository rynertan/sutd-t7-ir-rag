# A SYNTHETIC RESIN FOAMED BODY AND A METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF

## Abstract
The invention provides a foamed body of a chlorine containing synthetic resin of high expansion with extremely low bulk density still retaining very fine and uniform cellular structure. Different from conventional foamed bodies of polyvinyl chloride resins, the inventive foamed body is formed of a chlorinated polyvinyl chloride resin so that the foamed body has excellent heat resistance. The method for the preparation of the foamed resin comprises preparing a resin composition comprising a chlorinated polyvinyl chlor ide resin or a mixture thereof with a polyvinyl chloride resin, a foam conditioning resin, e.g. an acrylic resin or a styrene based resin, and a cell uniformnizing agent, e.g. a heat decomposable blowing agent or an inorganic fine powder supplying the resin composition to the cylinder of an extruder machine uniformly impregnating the at leat partly molten resin composition in the cylinder with a volatilizable blowing agent by pressurization and shaping the resin composition by extruding out of the extruder with simul taneous expansion by foaming.
