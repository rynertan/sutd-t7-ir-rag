# Novel double stranded DNA.

## Abstract
Double stranded DNA characterized by having sequ ences complementary to a single stranded DNA which has a molecular size of about 2.67 Kb and is derived from mungbean yellow mosaic virus, and giving the restriction endonuclease cleavage map shown in Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings and double stranded DNA characterized by having sequ ences complementary to a single stranded DNA which has a molecular size of about 2.70 Kb and is derived from mungbean yellow mosaic virus, and giving the restriction endonuclease cleavage map shown in Figure 2 of the accompanying drawings and hybrid DNAs having the double stranded DNAs inserted thereinto.
