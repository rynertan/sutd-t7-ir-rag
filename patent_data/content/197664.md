Guinea pigs 500 700 g of either sex are sacrificed and the hearts are quickly removed and transferred to a dissecting dish containing oxygenated bathing fluid.While in the bathing medium, the right ventricle is cut into two strips. The strips are each suspended in a 50 ml bath containing Krebs Henseleit solution at 37 C, and the bath is bubbled with 95 oxygen and 5 carbon dioxide. The ventricular strips are electrically stimulated at a frequency of 1.0 Hz, at double the threshold voltage. A resting tension of 1.0 g is applied to the strips and the tension is kept constant by readjustment during an equilibration period of 60 minutes. The bathing fluid is frequently changed during this period. When a steady base line is obtained, a compound under test is added to the bathing fluid and a cumulative concentration response curve is plotted.The compounds for use in the present invention which were tested gave a 50 ECs0 increase in the force of contraction of the ventricular strips at concentrations in the bathing fluid of less than 10 4 molar, thus showing that they have activity as positive inotropic agents. In the above test method the compound ofExample 1 gave an ECso value of 0.6 x 10 6M. In comparison amrinone gave a value of 15 x 1 O 6M.

The combined filtrates were evaporated and the residue was heated with pyridine 3 ml in the absence of a condenser, in an oil bath at 160 C for 3 hours. The residue was digested with acetonitrile as before to give the title compound, 0.55 g , m.p. 312 315 C. The products from two reactions were recrystallised together from aqueous dimethylformamide to give the title compound, m.p. 313 316 C, in 64 recovery. Example 5 R 6 4 1 ,4 Dihydro 4 oxo 2 pyrim idinylamino sphenyi 5 methyl 4,5 dihydro 3 2H pyridazinone A stirred mixture of R 6 4 aminophenyl 5methyl 4,5 dihydro 3 2H pyridazinone and 2 methylthiouracil in dry pyridine are heated together to afford the title compound.Example 6 Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration are prepared by combining the following w w 6 4 1,4 dihydro 4 oxo 2 pyrimi dinylamino phenyl 5 methyl 4,5dihydro 3 2H pyridazinone, 0.5 3.0 7.14 2 w w Soya lecithin in soya bean oil 90.45 88.2 84.41Hydrogenated vegetable shortening and beeswax 9.05 8.8 8.45The formulations are then filled into individual soft gelatin capsules.
