## Description
LOW TEMPERATURE PROCESS FOR DEPOSITING OXIDE LAYERS BY PHOTOCHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates generally to the manufacture of semiconductor devices and, more particularly, to a photochemical vapor deposition process for forming a dielectric oxide layer on the surface of a selected semiconductor material or an optical substrate, using a low temperature and non ionizing radiation. BACKGROUND ART In the manufacture of semiconductor devices, it is frequently necessary to form a dielectric layer either as a passivation layer to permanently protect the surface of the substrate or as a mask during such procedures as etching, solid state diffusion, or ion implantation.One method by which an oxide layer, such as silicon dioxide Si02 , may be formed is a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition process as described byJames A. Amick, G. L. Schnable, and J. L. Vossen, in the publication entitled, Deposition Techniques forDielectric Films or Semiconductor Devices, in theJournal of Vacuum Science Technology, Vol. 14, No. 5,Sept. Oct. 1977, pp. 1053 1063. In such a plasmaenhanced process, the vapor phase reactants, such as silane SiH4 and nitrous oxide N20 , are subjected to a radio frequency discharge, which creates an ionized plasma of the reactant gases.These ionized reactants then interact to form the desired reaction oct. However, as result of the exposure of the ctant gases to the radio frequency discharge, numerous extraneous ionized and neutral particles, as well as high energy radiation with wavelengths aslow as 500 angstroms .L. art even extending into the array region, are pro ducked and bombard the surface of the substrate on which the oxide is being formed.If the substrate comprises sensitive device type, such as a charge coupled device or 2 device for of certain compound semiconductors e.g., InSb, HgCdTe, or GaAs , the above described charged particles and unwanted radiation frequently impart damage to these sensitive devices. For example, the deposited oxide layer may incorporate charges or dangling bonds, x ,ich create high surface state cents ties ss at the semiconductor device oxide layer interface and which will trap charges when a voltage is applied to the device, thereby preventing optimum device performance.In addition, a plasma enhanced deposition process has the aisadvantage that plasma insuced heating of the substrate occurs as a result of selective absorption of the radio frequency energy by the substrate, and this heating causes uncertainty in the temperature of the substrate, which prevents optimization of the characteristics of the deposited oxide layer. Other methods by which oxide layers may be formed use a non reactive or a reactive sputtering technique.By a non reactive sputtering technique, as described, for example, by Amick et al as referenced above, a disk of the selected oxide material, such as SiO2, IS bombarded with argon ions, which cause the SiO2 to vaporize, and the vaporized SiO2 subsequently deposits on the selected substrate.By a reactive sputtering technique, as described, for example, by Amick et al as referenced above, a disk of silicon is bombarded with oxygen ions, which causes vaporization of the silicon, and the vaporized silicon and oxygen ions then react to produce the desired Si,. ocver, these sputtering techniques are similar the above described plasma processes in that they fre cuently irpar t damage to sensitive devices due to charge bo bardr ent or radiation bombardment of the device. In addition, the films produced by sputtering techniques are often granular, not dense, and not specular i.e., having good light reflecting properties . Both the sputtering technique and the plasmaenhanced method for chemical vapor deposition may be used to deposit a dielectric layer which incorporates a selected dopant material. In the former case, an appropriately doped target could be bombarded by selected ions. In the latter case, a dopant containing material is added to the reactant gases which are then ionized. However, both the above sputtering technique and the above plasma enhanced method suffer from the difficulties discussed above, particularly that of imparting damage due to charge bombardment or radiation bombardment and plasrna incuced heating of the substrate. Still another method by which oxide layers may be formed involves thermal processes as described byAmick et al as referenced above. In order to form SiO2, for example, by a thermal process, silane is brought into contact with oxygen at a low temperature and a spontaneous reaction occurs, forming SiO2. The films formed by thermal processes, however, are usually granular, do not necessarily have good adhesion, and tend to incorporate traps. It is the alleviation of the prior art problem of imparting damage to sensitive devices due to charge bombardment or radiation bombardment during the formation of an oxide layer thereon to which the present invention is directed. SU r RY OF THE INVENTION The general purpose of this invention is to provide new and improved process for depositing a layer of an oxide Of a chosen material on the surface of a selected substrate by low temperature photochemical vapor depo sition. This process possesses most, if not all, of the advar .ages of the above prior art oxide deposition processes, while overcoming their above mentioned significant disadvantages. The above general purpose of this invention is accomplished by exposing the substrate to a selected vapor phase reactant in the presence of photochemically generated, neutral ur,.onìzed oxygen atoms. The oxygen tos react with the vapor phase reactant to form the desired oxide, which deposits as a layer on the substrate.The use of photochemically generated neutral oxygen atoms avoids garage to the substrate due to charge bombardment or radiation bombardment. Accoruingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved process for depositing a layer of an oxide of a chosen material on the surface of a selected substrate by a novel, low temperature chemical vapor deposition process which avoi s damage to the substrate from charge or radiationbombardment. Another object of the present invention is to provide a process of the type described which minimizes the value of the surface state density at the oxide semiconductor substrate interface and thus minimizes the charge traps in the deposited oxide layer. Still another object is to provide a process of the type described which produces a low density of generation recombination centers in the deposited oxide layer, and thus provides good minority carrier lifetime and reduced susceptibility to radiation damage in the device formed by this process. Another object is to provide a process of the type cscrij which is performed at a temperature as low as room temperature e.g. 30 C and thus eliminates the problems of boundary migration and the resulting decreased device yields which are encountered in the fabrication of high density high speed devices at higher temperatures. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process of the type described which produces dense, non granular, adherent oxide films on selected substrates. Another object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved process for depositing a layer of a chosen oxide containing a selected dopant material on the surface of a substrate by a chemical vapor deposition process which avoids damage to the substrate due to charge bombardment or radiation bombardment. Still another object is to provide a new and improved process for depositing a layer of a chosen oxide containing a selected dopant material on the surface of a substrate, which uses a photochemical technique. The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following more particular description of the preferred embodiments of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 illustrates, in schematic form, a preferred apparatus for carrying out the processes according to first and second embodiments of the present invention, in which neutral oxygen atoms are formed by the mercury photosensitized dissociation of an oxygen containing precursor and are reacted to form an undoped or a doped oxide layer, respectively. FIG. 2 illustrates, in schematic form, a preferred apparatus for carrying out the processes according to third and fourth embodiments of the present invention, in which neutral oxygen atoms are formed by the direct dissociation of an oxygen containing precursor and are reacted to form an undoped or a doped oxide layer, respectively. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION FIG. 1 shows, in simplified form, an apparatus suitable for implementation of two process embodiments of the present invention in which neutral oxygen atoms are formed by the mercury photosensitized dissociation of a chemically unreactive oxygen containing precursor, such as nitrous oxide N2O , molecular oxygen 02 , or nitrogen dioxide NO2 . The term chemically unreactive is used herein to denote that a substance will not react with the designated reactants under normal mixture conditions. A reaction chamber 10, in which the chemical vapor deposition reaction occurs, is provided with a quartz window 12, which is integral with the top surface of the reaction chamber 10.The quartz window 12 is transmissive to the selected wavelength of radiation used to initiate the desired photochemical reaction to be discussed below, and this radiation 14 of a selected wavelength is produced by the radiation producing means 16, which may be, for example, an array of low pressure mercury vapor arc lamps.Within the reaction chamber 10, there is a substrate holder 18, which receives a substrate 20 onto which the desired oxide layer is to be deposited. External to the reaction chamber 10 and adjacen t to the bottom surface thereof, there are heating elements 21, which may be formed, for example, of Nichrome wire and are activated by applying a controlled voltage thereto. The heating elements 21 may be used optionally to heat the substrate 20 to the required temperature so that appropriate properties of the deposited layers such as density, may be obtained.The temperature in the chamber 10 may be maintained as low as room ter.per nature i.e. 30 C or as high as required e.g., 3000C cr higher . owever, since mercury vapcr arc lamps, for e am le, become less efficient at increased temperatures, it is necessary to provide external water cooling or an external air or nitrogen cooling source to cool these lamps and remove radiant heat produced by the substrate 20 and substrate holder 18 at certain elevated temperatures as high as 600 C, for example,or higher .For this purpose, the radiation producing means 16 is completely contained within the enclosure 23, which may be formed of aluminum, and an external cooling means 25, such as pipes with water flowing therethrough as shown in FIG. 1 or flowing nitrogen gas, is activated to apply cooling to the enclosure 23. The enclosure 23 is secured to the outside surface of the reaction chamber 10 which surrounds the quartz window 12, but may be removed therefrom as required. Thus, the processing temperature is maintained at a level such that sufficient cooling of the mercury lamps can be accomplished in order to provide efficient lamp performance. The enclosure 23 also provides eye protection to the operator from the radiation 14.Leading from the reaction chamber 10, there is a tube 22 which passes through a valve 24 and then to a vacuum producing means, such as a pump, not shown , which is used to evacuate the chamber 10 to a sufficiently low pressure to allow the vapor deposition reaction to occur. External to the reaction chamber 10, there are chambers 26 and 28 which contain the individual reactant gases for the selected chemical vapor deposition reaction, for example, silane and nitrous oxide. The chambers 26 and 28 are connected to control valves or flowmeters 30 and 32, respectively, which are used to control the amounts of reactants which are introduced into a tube 34.Alternatively, for a second process embodiment of the present invention discussed below , there are included a third chamber 27, which contains the precursor of the selected contact material, such as phosphine, and a correspon ing control valve or flowmeter 31, which controls the amount of copant precursor introduced from the chamber 27 into t tube 34, where it is mixer with the other reactant chases discussed above. The reactant gases flow through the tube 34 Into a chamber 36 which contains a pool of mercury at room temperature having mercury vapor above it, at a vapor . pressure of 10 3 Torr at 30 CC. The reactant gases thus. become mixed with mercury vapor in the chamber 36 and this reactant gas mixture then passes through a ttibe 38 no into the reaction chamber 10, where the chemical vapor deposition reaction may be brought about. The components of tne apparatus shown in FIG. 1 may be constructed of. Less steel or aluminum, unless otherwise specified.The apparatus shown in FIG. 1 may be used for either a low pressure continuous flow photochemical reactor system, in which there is a continuous influx of reactant gases and removal of reaction by products during the photochemical reaction process, or for a static photo clerical reactor system, in which specified amounts of reactants are introduced into the reaction chamber, the flow of reactant gases is stopped, and then the photochemical reaction process is allowed to occur. In practicing the present invention in accordancewith the first embodiment thereof, which depends on the photochemical generation of atomic oxygen, and using the apparatus of FIG. 1 with only two reactant gas chambers chambers 26 and 28 , a chemical vapor deposition process is performed as generally described by Werner Kern andRichard S. Hosier in the publication entitled, Advances in Deposition Processes for Passivation Films , in theJournal of Vacuum Science Technology, Vol. 14, No. 5 , Sept. Oct. 1977, pp. 1082 1099, in the discussion of low pressure chemical vapor deposition processes.The reaction cham. r 10 is evacuated by the vacuum producing means to a predeterminod pressure, for example 1 to 4 Torr. The selected vapor phase reactant, such as SiH4, is placed in a chamber such as the chamber 26, and a chemically unreactive oxygen containing precursor, such as N2O, is placed in a chamber such as the chamber 28. The valves 30 and 32 are set so that the reactants from the chambers 26 and 28, respectively, in a predetermined ratio and at a predetermined flow rate may pass into the tube 34 and then into the chamber 36, which contains a pool of mercury.These reactant gases become mixed with mercury vapor in the caber 36 and pass from the chamber 36 through the tube 38 into the reaction chamber 10, which is maintained at approximately room temperature e.g. 30 C or up to 2000C or higher. The radiation producing means 16 is activiated ad produces the radiation 14 of a selected wavelength required to produce the desired photochemical reaction e.g. 2537 to produce mercury in an excited state .The radiation 14 passes through the quartz window 18 into the reaction chamber 10, where it excites the mercury Hg atoms in the reactant gas mixture to form mercury atoms in an excited state Hg approximately 5 electron volts above normal ground state, but un onized , as shown inEquation 1 below. The Hg then collides with the oxygencontaining precursor, such as N2O, and causes the precursor to dissociate and produce atomic oxygen O , as shown inEquation 2a below. In addition, the Hg may react with the selected vapor phase reactant, such as SiH4, to produce d reactive radical, such as SiH3, as shown in equation 2b below. Finally, the atomic oxygen reacts with the reactant, SiH4, or the reactive radical, such as SiH3, to produce the desired oxide, such as SiO and SiO2, as shown in Equations 3a and, 3b below. Either SiO orSiO2 can be produced, depending on the reactant gas ratio of S r. and N20 i.e. the steady state concentration of atomic oxygen which oxdizes SiH4 . 1 HG h 2537 Hg here h Planck s constant 9 frequency of absorbed radiation 2a Hg N20 N2 0 Hg 2b SiH4 Hg SiH3 H HgEMI10.1 The reaction of Hg with SiH4 to form the radical SiH3 is â side reaction which is not necessary to the process of the present invention, but leads to the same end product as the major reaction path.The atomic oxygen produced in Equation 2a above may react directly with the selected vapor phase reactant without first forming an intermediâte radical, as described in Equation 3a above. Alternatively, the atomic oxygen required for this first process embodiment of the present invention may be formed by the mercury sensitized dissociation of nitrogen dioxide NO2 to form atomic oxygen and NO. Further, atomic oxygen may also be formed by the mercury sensitized dissociation of molecular oxygen in accordance with Equations 4 and 5 below, or by other known means for forming atomic oxygen by photochemical processes.EMI10.2 Since molecular oxygen reacts spontaneously with SiH4 as discussed in relation to the prior art thermal oxidation process, it is necessary to inhibit this spontaneous thermal oxidation process in order to permit the formation of of ato.c oxygen and the reaction thereof with Sil in accordance with the process of the present invention. This rljition IS accomplished by carefully controlling the operating pressure and the ratio of reactant gases, as discussed in more detail in Example 3 below. By controlling such process parameters the ther mal oxidation process may be completely inhibited and the oxidation process of the present invention may occur without any competing processes. By the above described process of the present invention, oxygen atoms are produced by a photochemical process which generates only neutral particles. Thus, the prior art problems associated with the generation of charged particles and high energy radiation which bombard the substrate have been avoided. The value of the surface state density less at the oxide semi conductor substrate interface and thus the charge traps in the oxide or insulator layer are minimized by the process of the present invention. In addition, a low density of generation recombination centers i.e., dangling bonds or traps is produced and thus good minority carrier lifetime is achieved in devices formed by the process of the present invention. In addition, the process of the present invention provides enhanced protection against device damage due to radiation i.e.from a cobalt 60 source by minimizing the creation of dangling bonds and traps during the deposition of the oxide or insulator layer. These traps and dangling bonds normally increase the probability of the device and their minimizationEMI11.1 radiation damage. Further, the problem of boundary migration has been eliminated since the process of the present invention can be conducted at a relatively low temperature, i.e. as low as room temperature and the associated problem of decreased device yield encountered in the high temperature fabrication of high density, vices such as very large scale integrated circuits and very high speed integrated circuits, has been avoided.In addition, the prior art problem of plasma induced netting is avoided by the process of the present invention since selective absorption of radiation by the substrate does not occur in the process described herein. Furthermore, the process of the present invention is free of. particulate formation, for example, on chamber walls, whIch is a problem often encountered in the prior art processes discussed above. Finally, the oxide layer formed by the process of the present invention is dense, non granular, scratch resistant, specular, has negligible porosity, and is strongly adherent to a variety of surfaces, such as semiconductor, metal and inorganic surfaces. Such oxide layers find utility both as a passivat ion layer and as a gate insulator layer in integrated circuit devices. Furthermore, these oxide layers may be used as a conformal coating on integrated circuits and hybrid microcircuits. In addition, these oxide.layers may be used in the fabrication of HgCdTe photo conductIve and photovoltaic devices. This first process emnodlrent of the present invention and the related third process embodiment discussed below are, to my knowledge, the first demonstration of the use of a photochemical process for the deposition of a dielectric layer on a substrate. Using the above described process, the present invention may also be used to oxidize trimethyl aluminum, CH3 3 Al, to A1203 trimethyl gallium, CH3 3Ga, toGa203 germane, GeH4, to GeO2 diborane, B2H6, to B203 trimethyl indium, CH3 3In to In203 titanium tetrachloride, TiC14 to TiO2 tungsten hexafluoride, WF6, to W203, and hafnium hydrid HîH4, to Hf02. This first process embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in Example 1 below. Furthermore, a process carried out in accordance with vn 2 second embodirent of the present invention may be par Corr, ed by practicing the present invention as described above, using the apparatus of FIG. 1 with three 3 reactant gas chambers chambers 26, 27, and 28 , to deposit on the surface of a chosen substrate an oxide layer which incorporates a selected dopant material in order to modify the physical, electrical, or optical characteristics of the oxide layer.To accomplish this second process embodiment of the present invention, the selected vapor phase reactant, such as SiN4, is exposed to simul taneousiy formed and photochemically generated neutral oxygen atoms and neutral atoms or atomic fragments of the selected dopant, such as phosphorus containing phosphinyl radicals. The neutral atomic particles are produced by the mercury photosensitized dissociation of a chemically unreactive oxygen containing precursor, such as nitrous oxide N2O and a chemically unreactive dopant contain ng precursor, such as phosphine PH3 , which results in the generation of atomic oxygen and neutral phosphinyl radicals, respectively, as shown in Equations 6 through 8 below.The atomic oxygen and phosphinyl radicals subsequently oxidize the SiN4 to phosphorus doped silicon dioxide Si P 02 , as shown in Equation 9 below.EMI13.1 A mechanistic alternative to the sequence described above involves the simultaneous oxidation of both SiH4 andPH3 by atomic oxygen, as indicated in Equations 10 through 12 below. Thus, atomic oxygen alone may be sufficient to bring about the desired reaction as shown inEquation 12 below. Consequently, the production of neutral particles of the selected dopant material as described above in Equation 8 may not be necessary in practicing the second process embodiment of this invention, but may occur.EMI14.1 The procedure followed to accomplish this second process embodiment of the invention is essentially as. described above with respect to the first process embodiment of the present invention, except that additionally, a controlled amount of a selected dopant containing precursor is introduced from the chamber 27 through the control valve 31 into the tube 34, where it mixes with the reactant gases from the chambers 26 and 28. Thus, by this second process embodiment of the present invention, a doped dielectric film may be deposited by a low temperature process which avoids the generation of charged particles and high energy radiation and their consequent bobardent damage to the substrate. Additionally, this embodiment has all the advantages enumerated above with respect to the formation of an undoped dielectric layer by the process of the present invention.This second process embodiment of the present invention and the related fourth process embodiment discussed below are, to my knowledge, the first demonstration of the use of a photochemical process for the deposition of a doped dielectric layer. By the process according to this second embodiment of the present invention, other dopants besides phosphorus may be incorporated in the deposited dielectric layer by addition of the corresponding dopant containing precursor to the reactant gas mixture. For example, diborane B2H6 may be used for,boron doping, arsine AsH3 may be used for arsenic doping, stibine SbH3 may be used for antimony doping, hydrogen selenide H2Se may be used for selenium doping, hydrogen sulfide H2S may be used for sulfur doping, or hydrogen telluride H2Te may be used for tellurium doping. Other dopant containing precursors which are capable of the mercury photosensitized dissociation reaction of the type discussed herein may also be used. Other dielectric films besides SiO2 may be formed, as discussed above.This second process embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in more detail in Example 2 below. Turning now to FIG. 2, there is shown an apparatus suitable for implementation of the processes according to of third and fourth embodiments of the present invention, in which neutral oxygen atoms are formed by a direct photochemical reaction of an oxygen containing precursor, thus eliminating the requirement of mercury photosensitization. A reaction chamber 40 in which the photochemical vapor deposition reaction occurs is provided with a traps parent window 42, which is integral with the top surface of the chamber 40. The material of which the window 42 is formed is chosen to be transparent to the selected wavelength or radiation which will be used for the photochemical reaction. Radiation 44 having a selected wavelength is produced by a radiation producing means 46, such as an array of low pressure mercury vapor arc lamps, and passes through the window 42 into the chamber 40. Within the reaction chamber 40, there is a substrate holder 48, which holds a substrate 50 onto which the desired oxide layer is to be deposited. External to the reaction chamber 40 at the bottom surface thereof, there are heating elements 51, which may be formed of Nichrome wire and are activated by application of a controlled voltage thereto. The heating elements 51 may be used optionally to preheat the substrate 50 to the required temperature for forming a deposited layer with desired properties. In practicing the present invention, the temperature in the chamber 40 may be maintained as low as room tempcra ture or as high as 2000C or higher. In order to provide the required cooling of the radiation producing means 46, as previously discussed in relation to FIG. 1, radiationproducing means 46 is completely enclosed within the enclosure 53, which may be formed of aluminum, and an. external cooling means 55, such as pipes with water flowing therethrough as shown in FIG. 2 or flowing nitrogen gas, is activated to apply cooling to the enclosure 53.The enclosure 53 performs the additional function of eliminating the formation of ozone which would occur the radiation 44 such as 1849 radiation were allowed to contact molecular oxygen in the open atmosphere, which would cause the formation of atomic oxygen that would then react with additional molecular oxygen in the atmosphere to form ozone. The enclosure 53 is secured to the outside surface of the reaction chamber 40 which surrounds the quartz window 42, but may be removed therefrom as required. Leading from the reaction chamber 40, there is a tube 52 which passes through, a valve 54 and then to a vacuum producing means, e.g., a vacuum pump, not shown which is used to evacuate the chamber 40 to a sufficiently low pressure e.g., 1 4 Torr to allow the vapor deposition reaction to occur. External to the reaction chamber 40, there are chambers 56 and 58, which contain the individual selected reactant gases, such as silane SiH4 and nitrous oxide N2D , respectively, for producing the desired photochemical reaction. The chambers 56 and 58 are connected to control valves or flowmeters 60 and 62, respectively, which are used to control the amounts of reactants which are introduced into a tube 64.Alternatively, in ac ordance with a fourth process embodiment of the present invention discussed below , there are included a third chamber 57, which contains the precursor of the selected dopant material, such as phosphine, and a corresponding control valve C flometer 61, which controls the amount of dopant precursor introduced from the chamber 57 into the tube 64, where it is mixed with the other reactant gases discussed above. The reactant gases flow through the tube 64 into the reaction chamber 40, where the photochemical reaction may be brought about. The components of the apparatus shown in FIG. 2 may be constructed of stainless steel.or aluminum, unless otherwise specifled.The apparatus shown in FIG. 2 may be used for either a continuous flow photochemical reactor system or a static photochemical reactor system, as discussed above with reference to FIG. 1. In practicing the present invention in accordance with the third embodiment thereof and using the apparatus of FIG. 2, the general process described in relation to the first process embodiment of FIG. 1 is followed, except that no mercury is used for photosensitization.The valves 60 and 62 are set so that the reactant gases, such as Sib4 and N2O, from the chambers 56 and 58, respectively1 pass in a predetermined ratio and at a predetermined flow rate into the tube 64 and then into the reaction chamber 40. The radiation producing means 46 is activated and produces the radiation 44 of a selected wavelength, which is the appropriate wavelength to cause the direct dissociation of the selected oxygen containing precursor e.g. 1750 1950 for N20 . The radiation 44 passes through the window 42, which is formed of a material that is transparent to the wavelength of the radiation 44.The radiation 44 passes into the reaction chamber 40, where it causes the dissociation of the selected oxygen containing precursor, such as N20 into atomic oxygen, which then reacts with the selected vapor phase reactant, such as SiH4, to form the desired oxide, such asSiO2 and SiO, as shown in Equations 13 and 14 below. EMI18.1 Alternatively, the atomic oxygen required for this third process embodiment of the present invention may be formed by the direct photochemical dissociation of molecular oxygen as shown in Equation 15 below or of nitrogen dioxide NO2 as shown in Equation 16 below or of similar known materials which are capable of dissociation to oxygen by a direct photochemical process.EMI18.2 When molecular oxygen is used as the source of atomic oxygen, the operating pressure and reactant gas ratio rust be carefully controlled in order to inhibit the spontaneous thermal oxidation of the SiH4 by the O2I as previously discussed in relation to an alternative process embodiment of the present invention and as illustrated in Example 3 below. By the above described process in accordance with this third embodiment of the present invention, oxygen atoms are generated by a photochemical process which produces only neutral particles. Thus, the previously discussed prior art problems caused by the generation of charged particles and high energy radiation and their bombardment of the substrate have been avoided. The advantages of this third process embodiment of the present invention are the same as those discussed in relation to the first process embodiment des,cribe.d with respect to FIG. 1. In addition, the process according to this third embodiment has the advantage that no photosensitizing mercury is necessary, and thus possible mercury contamination of the deposited oxide can be avoided.Further, the apparatus for carrying out the process according to this third embodiment is less complex than an apparatus requiring the use of mercury. Using the above described process, the present invention may also be used to deposit dielectric oxides of gallium, germanium, boron, and indium and metal oxides of aluminum, tungsten, titanium, and hafnium, using the gas phase reactants discussed in relation to FIG. 1.This third process embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in Example 3 below. Furthermore, a process carried out in accordance with a fourth embodiment of the present invention may be performed by practicing the present invention as described above, but also using the apparatus of FIG. 2 with three 3 reactant gas chambers chambers 56, 57, and 58 , to deposit an oxide layer which incorporates a selected dopant material, on the surface of a chosen substrate. To accomplish this fourth process embodiment of the present invention, the selected vapor phase reactant, such as SiH4, is exposed to photochemically generated neutral oxygen atoms in the presence of a dopant containing precursor, such as phosphine PH3 . The neutral atomic oxygen is produced by direct dissocia tion of an oxygen containing precursor, such as N2O, by radiation of a selected wavelength as shown in Equation 17 below. The atomic oxygen then simultaneously oxidizes the SiH4 and PH3 to form the desired phosphorusdoped SiO2 as shown in Equation 18 below.EMI19.1 A possible alternative to the above described sequence involves the direct dissociation of the dopantcontaining precursor such as phosphine to form a neutral phosphinyl radical as shown in Equation 19 below. The phosphinyl radical so formed and the atomic oxygen formed in accordance with the direct dissociation reaction ofEquation 17 above then react with the silane reactant to form the desired phosphorus doped SiO2 as shown inEquation 20 below.EMI20.1 The procedure followcd to accomplish the process according to the fourth embodiment of this invention is essentially as described above with respect to the third process embodiment of the present invention, except that additionally a controlled amount of a selected dopant containing precursor, such as phosphine gas, is introduced from the chamber 57 and through the valve 61 into the tube 64, where it mixes with the reactant gases from the chambers 56 and 58. Thus, by this fourth process embodiment of the.present invention, a doped dielectric film may be deposited by a low temperature process which avoids the generation of charged particles and high energy radiation and their consequent bombardment damage to the substrate and additionally avoids the use of mercury for photosensitization. The significance of these advantages has been discussed above with respect to the third process embodiment of the present invention.Various dopant materials other than phosphine may be used, and these materials include diborane, arsine, stibine, hydrogen selenide, hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen telluride, or other dopant containing precursors which are capable of simultaneous oxidation by atomic oxygen with the selected gas phase reactant to form the desired doped oxide layer. This fourth process embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in Example 4 below. EXAMPLE 1 This example illustrates the use of the process according to the first embodiment of the present invention as previously described herein. Using the apparatus described and illustrated in relation to FIG. 1 with two reactant gas chambers, SiO and SiO2 were independently deposited on the surface of a wafer of silicon having a two inch diameter. Nitrous oxide was used as the oxygen containing precursor and silane was the selected vapor phase reactant. The reaction chamber 10 was evacuated by the vacuum producing means to a pressure of 10 3 Torr, then back filled with nitrogen, and again evacuated to a pressure of 10 3 Torr.The flowmeters 30 and 32 were activated to admit the reactant gases SiH and N2O in a predetermined ratio into the tube 34 and subsequently into the chamber 36 and the reaction chamber 10, and the reactant gas flow rates were stabilized. The operating pressure within the reaction chamber 10 was adjusted by means of the valve 24 to achieve a pressure of approximately 1 Torr. The heatin elements 21 and the cooling means 25 were activated.Finally, the low pressure mercury arc resonance lamps were activated and emitted radiation at 2537, which was absorbed by the mercury vapor in the reaction chamber, producing photo excited mercury atoms, which collided with the nitrous oxide to form atomic oxygen.The atomic oxygen then oxidized the silane to either SiO2 or SiO. When using a continuous flow photochemical reactor system at an operating pressure of 2 Torr, with a reactant gas flow ratio of 2 standard cubic centimeters per minute sccm of SiH4 to 50 sccm of N20, a layer of SiO2 was produced. When a reactant gas flow ratio of 2 sccm of SiH4 to 10 sccm of N20 was used in a continuous flow system, a layer of SiO was produced. At a substrate temperature of 1000C, the silicon oxide layer was deposi ted at the rate of 200 per minute using a continuous flow system. When using a static photochemical reactor system with a reactant gas ratio of SiH, to N20 of 3 millimeters mm to 12 mm, silicon monoxide Si0 was produced as a layer on the surface of the silicon wafer. When a reactant gas ratio of SiH4 to N20 of 3.0mm to 30mum was used in a static system, silicon dioxide SiO2 was produced as the layer on the silicon wafer. The refractive index of the photodeposited silicon oxide layers formed by the process of this embodiment of the present invention was determined by ellipsometry as a function of the reactant gas mixture ratio, N20 SiH4.Mixtures rich in N20 i.e. atomic oxygen produced films with a refractive index characteristic of Si02, ixtures of N20 SiH4 progressively leaner in N20 yielded silicon oxide films with less oxygen content and, ultimately, SiO with a refractive index of 1.88. The etch rate characteristics of the photodeposited Si02 material in buffered HF were comparable to those of Si02 films deposited by low temperature plasma techniques. The stoichiometric composition of the film was determined by Auger electron spectroscopy. The Si02 films exhibited an excellent composition depth profile and stoichiometrically were equivalent to pureSi02.The SiO films exhibited slower etch rates than the Si02 films due to the depleted oxygen content of the SiO films, which was confirmed by Auger spectroscopic analysis. The breakdown voltage of the Si02 films formed by the process of the present invention was determined to be 3.0 x 106 volts centimeter, the dielectric constant was approximately 5.5, and the dissipation factor was 1.5 x 10 2, which measurements are comparable to the values obtained for similar films formed by a prior art thermal process previously discussed. The density of the Si02 films formed by the process of the present invention was 2.3 grams cubic centimeter. The photochemically deposited Si02 layers formed by the above described process of the present invention have application as dielectric layers for the passivation of semiconductor devices, particularly charge sensitive microelectronic devices, such as silicon MOS devices, HgCdTe photoconductive and photovoltaic devices, andGas field effect transistors. These layers may be deposited to a typical thickness of 1200 1500S for such pur ase. In addition, the process of the present invention may be used to deposit an anti reflective oxide coating on a lens, including a plastic lens, or a solar cell, or to deposit a protective oxide coating on a mirror. Using the above described process, SiO2 layers were similarly deposited on Ge, InSb, and Al substrates. EXAMPLE 2 This example illustrates the use of the process according to the second embodiment of the present invention as previously described herein. Using the apparatus described and illustrated in relation to FIG. 1 with three reactant gas chambers, a layer of phosphorus doped SiO2 was deposited on the surface of a silicon wafer having a two inch diameter. The general procedure described in relation to Example 1 above was followed, with the addition of a third reactant gas. Nitrous oxide was used as the oxygen containing precursor, silane was the selected vapor phase reactant, and phosphine was the phosphorus dopant containing precursor. The process was initiated by the photochemical excitation of mercury vapor at 10 3 Torr in a quartz reaction chamber. Low pressure mercury arc resonance lamps emitted radiation at 2537, which was absorbed by the mercury vapor in the reaction chamber, producing photo excited mercury atoms that reacted with the N20 and PH3 as shown in Equations 7 and 8 discussed above.The atomic oxygen and neutral phosphinyl radical PH2 thus formed reacted with the SiH4 to form phosphorusdoped silicon dioxide Si P O2 as shown in Equation 9 discussed above, which deposited as a layer on the silicon wafer. Using a continuous flow photochemical reactor system, with a reactant gas flow ratio of SiH4 N2O PH3 of 2 60 1 sccm, a phosphorus doped SiO2 . layer was deposited on the substrate at the rate of 200 minute and the phosphorus content of the deposited layer was approximately 5 . In addition, a low pressure static photochemical reactor system was used with a reactant gas ratio of SiH4 N2O PH3 of 3 30 1 mm. The phosphorus doped SiO2 layer was deposited at initial rates of 200A minute and the phosphorus content in the deposited layer was approximately 5 . Using a reactant gas ratio of SiH4 N20 PH3 of. 2 30 12 mm in a static system, levels of phosphorus doping of 178 in the deposited layer have been achieved. The refractive index of the photodeposited phosphorus doped SiO2 layer was dependent on the N2O PH3 ratio and indices from 1.55 to 1.65 were measured. The films exhibiting the higher refractive indices indicated a greater phosphorus doping content of the SiO2 dielectric material. The chemical composition of the phosphorusdoped SiO2 films was determined by Auger electron spectroscopy and the phosphorus content was confirmed by energy dispensive X ray analysis EDAX .The etch rate in P etch i.e., a mixture of 60 milliliters ml of water, 3 ml of 49 HF, and 2 ml of 70 HNO3 of the phosphorusdoped SiO2 films was significantly faster than that of pure SiO2, yielding values of 200 second, which concur with values of phosporus doped films produced by known chemical vapor deposition techniques previously dis cussed. The amount of dopant contained in the dielectric layer deposited by the above described process may be controlled by adjusting the amount of dopant containing precursor which is added to the reactant gas mixture. Although phosphorus doped SiO2 layers were formed as described above, it is also possible to form .phosphorus doped SiO layers by this process embodiment of the present invention by increasing the ratio of SiH4 to N20 in a manner similar to that described in Example 1. The photochemically deposited phosphorus dopedSiO2 films formed by the above described process of the present invention have application as dielectric layers for the passivation of charge sensitive microelectronic devices, such as silicon MOS devices. In addition, these phosphorus doped films may be used as a counter diffusion layer on GaAs devices for the minimization of outdiffusion of both gallium Ga and arsenic As at temperatures exceeding 1000C. EXAMPLE 3 This example illustrates the use of the process in accordance with the third embodiment of the present invention as previously described herein. Using the apparatus shown in FIG. 2 with two reactant gas chambers, a layer of si02 was deposited on the surface of a wafer of silicon having a two inch diameter. The general procedure described in relation to Example 1 above was followed, except that mercury sensitization was not used. A continuous flow photochemical reactor system was used. the oxygen containing precursor was N20 and the selected spoor phase reactant was SiH4.Radiation having a wavelength of 1849 was used to dissociate the N20 and the window of the reaction chamber was formed of spectrasil obtained from Thermal American Fused Quartz, Aontville, NewJersey , which was transparent to 1g9 radiation. Low pressure mercury arc lamps designed with spectrasil envelopes emitted radiation at 1849 ,which was transmitted through the spectrasil window into the reaction chamber.The radiation was absorbed by the N2D and caused dissociation thereof to produce atomic oxygen The atomic oxygen then reacted with the SiH4 to produce the desired Si02 which deposited as a layer on the silicon wafer, A reactant gas flow ratio of SiH4 to U of 2 sccm to 60 sccm and an operating pressure of 3.7 Torr were used. The SiO2 layer was deposited at the rate of 700 in 30 minutes, and even higher rates may be achieved with process optimization. The refractive index of the photodeposited Si02 layer formed by the above described process of the present invention was determined by.ellipsometry and the films were found to have a refractive index characteristic of Si02, i.e. 1.45. The etch rate characteristics of the photodeposited Si02 material in buffered HF were comparable to those of Si02 films deposited by low temperature plasma techniques. Although SiO2 layers were formed as described above, it is also possible to form SiO layers by this process embodiment of the present invention by increasing the ratio of SiH4 to N20 in a manner similar to that described in Example 1. The photochemically deposited Si02 layers formed by the above described process of the present invention have application as dielectric layers for the passivation of semiconductor devices, particularly charge sensitive microelectronic devices, such as MOS devices and GaAs, HgCdTe photoconductive and photovoltaic devices, fieldeffect transistors. In addition, the oxide layers formed by the above described process may be used on electrooptical materials such as lenses and mirrors or on solar cells as described in relation to Example 1. Using the above described process, SiO2 layers were similarly deposited on Ge, InSb, and Al substrates. Furthermore, using the general process described above, a layer of Si02 was deposited on the surface of a silicon wafer, using molecular oxygen 02 as the oxygen containing precursor. In order to completely inhibit the spontaneous thermal oxidation reaction of 02 and SiH4, a nitrogen gas diluent was used and the pressure and flow rate conditions of the reactant gases were carefully controlled. Using an operating pressure of 0 5 Torr and a reactant gas flow ratio of SiH4 02 N2 of 1 20 80 sccm, a layer of Si02 was deposited at the rate of 3000 to 4000 in 30 minutes. Thus, it may be seen that the use of molecular oxygen as the oxygen containing precursor in practicing the present invention greatly enhances the oxide deposition rate. EXAMPLE 4 This example illustrates the use of the process in accordance with the fourth embodiment of the present invention as previously described herein. Using the apparatus described and illustrated in relation to FIG. 2 with three reactant gas chambers, a phosphorus doped SiO2 layer was deposited on the surface of a silicon wafer having a two inch diameter. The general procedure described in relation to Example 3 above was followed, with the addition of a third reactant gas.A continuous flow photochemical reactor system was used.Nitrous oxide was used as the oxygen containing precursor, silane was the selected vapor phase reactant, and phos phine was the dopant containing precursor. Radiation having a wavelength of 1849 was used to dissociate the N2O and the window of the reaction chamber was formed of spectrasil as discussed in relation to Example 3. The 1849 radiation was absorbed by the N20 and caused dissociation thereof to produce atomic oxygen. The atomic oxygen then reacted with the SiH4 and PH3 as shown inEquation 18 above, to produce the desired phosphorusdoped SiO2, which deposited as a layer on the silicon wafer. A low pressure continuous flow photochemical reactor system was used with a reactant gas flow ratio of SiH4 N20 PH3 of 2 60 4 sccm. The SiO2 was deposited at the rate of 330 in 30 minutes, and even higher rates may be achieved with process optimization. The phosphoruscontent of the deposited layer was approximately 5 . The refractive index of the photodeposited phosphorus doped SiO2 layer formed as described above was 1.75. The chemical composition of the deposited film was determined by Auger electron spectroscopy to be the value discussed above. The etch rate in P etch i.e., a mixture of 60 ml of water, 30 ml of 49 HF, and 2. ml of 70 HNO3 of the phosphorus doped SiO2 film was determined to be significantly faster than that of pure SiO2, having values comparable to phosphorusdoped films produced by known chemical vapor deposition techniques previously discussed. The photochemically deposited phosphorus dopedSiO2 films formed by the above described process of the present invention find utility as discussed in relation to Example 2. While the present invention has been particularly described with the respect to the preferred embodiments thereof, it will recognized by those skilled in the art that certain modifications in form and detail may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. In particular, the scope of the invention is not limited to the photochemical vapor deposition of silicon oxides, but is intended to include the photochemical vapor deposition of an oxide of any gas phase reactant that will react with atomic oxygen, such as reactants containing germanium, gallium, boron, indium, aluminum, titanium, tungsten and hafnium.In addition, the chemically unreactive oxygen containing precursor is not limited to nitrous oxide, molecular oxygen, or nitrogen dioxide, but is intended to include any material which will photochemically dissociate to atomic oxygen, either with or without mercury sensitization. Further, the substrate on which oxide deposition may be performed by the process of the present invention is not limited to silicon, which was used merely as an example, but may include other semiconductor substrate materials, such as GaAs, HgCdTe, or InSb, or electro optical materials, such as lenses or mirrors, or GaAs or Si solar cells. Finally, the scope of the invention is not limited to the use of phosphine to produce phosphorus doping, but is intended to include any dopant containing precursor which is capable of mercury photosensitized dissociation to form neutral particles or which is capable of simultaneous oxidation by atomic oxygen with the selected gas reactant.Such precursors include diborane, arsine, stibine, hydrogen selenide, hydrogen sulfide, or hydrogen telluride, to produce boron , arsenic , antimony , selenium , sulfur , or tellurium doping, respectively.
