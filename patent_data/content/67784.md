# Catalysts for ring opening copolymerization of cycloolefins.

## Abstract
A catalyst for the ring opening copolymerization of a hexachlorocyclopentadiene 1,5 cyclooctadiene adduct and a cycloolefin, other than cyclohexene, having 4 to 12 carbon atoms and containing at least one non conjugated vinylene double bond. Owing to modification by oxy bidentate type ligands, the chlorotungsten catalyst system affords a more favorable comonomer reactivity ratio and is thus utilized.
