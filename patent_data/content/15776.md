## Description
1,1 BIPHENYL 2 YL ALKYLAMINE DERIVATIVES, THEIR PRODUCTION AND CARDIOVASCULAR PREPARATIONS CONTAINING SAME. This invention relates to a novel class of 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl alkylamine derivatives which are useful in the chemotherapy of cardiovascular disorders. Cardiovascular disorders are responsible for thousands of deaths each year. Cardiac arrhythmias are one of.these disorders contributing to such deaths.Whilst the true causes of arrhythmias are unknown, it is believed that they are caused by some abnormality in the rate, regularity or site of origin of cardiac impulses, or by disturbances which affect the sequence of activation of the atria and ventricles. Several drugs currently are used in the treatment of arrhythmias, the most notable including quinidine, procainamide, lidocaine and digitalis. A great deal of interest recently has been generated over a new antiarrhythmic agent, aprindine, a 2 aminoindane derivative see U.S. Patent Nc. 3,923,813. Several diphenylalkylamines also have recently been reported to have useful antiarrhythmic activity see U.S. PatentNos. 4,001,328, 4,034,011 and 3,987,201. Unfortunately, most if not all of these existing drugs possess undesirable side effects and thus there exists a continuing need for new drugs capable of being used in the treatment of arrythmias and possessing reduced incidence of undesired side effects. Accordingly, the present invention provides compounds of formula I EMI2.1 wherein X is hydrogen or a halo substituent at any position in the phenyl ring R1 is hydrogen, hydroxy, C N, CONR5R6, whereR5 and R6 independently represent hydrogen or C1 6 S 8 alkyl, or CO2R8 where R8 is hydrogen or C14 alkyl R2 is hydrogen or C1 3 alkyl Z is CH2 n orEMI2.2 where n is an integer of from 2 to 4 R3 and R4 independently are hydrogen, C1 6 alkyl, CH2C2 5 alkenyl, phenyl C13 alkyl, or taken together with the adjacent nitrogen atom form a heterocyclic group containing from 5 to 7 ring atoms and optionally containing one heteroatom selected from oxygen and nitrogen and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Preferred compounds of formula I are those wherein X is hydrogen, or fluoro, chloro or bromo situated at the 5 position of the biphenyl ring RÚ is hydrogen, hydroxy, C N, CONH2 or COOH Rê IS HYDROGEN or methyl, Z is CH2 n where n is 2 or 3 or is CH2CH OH CH2 when RÚ is hydrogen and R3 and R independently are hydrogen, C1 6 alkyl, CH2C2 5 alkenyl, phenyl C1 3 alkyl, or taken together with the adjacent nitrogen atom form a heterocyclic group selected from pyrrolidino, piperidino and morpholino and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition or quaternary ammonium salts thereof. Other preferred compounds of formula I have one or more of the following features 1.. X is hydrogen or fluoro 2. R1 is hydroxy 3. R1 is C N 4. R1 is CONH2 5. R2 is hydrogen 6. R3 is other than hydrogen 7. R3 is C14 alkyl, especially isopropyl 8. R4 is hydrogen or C14 alkyl 9. Z is CH2CH2CH2 10. Z isEMI3.1 11. are pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts or 12. are pharmaceutically acceptable quaternary ammonium salts. This invention also provides pharmaceutical formulations which comprise a compound of formula I , or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, associated with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor. The biphenylyl alkylamines provided by the invention are basic substances which readily react with organic and inorganic acids to form salts. Those acid addition salts which are substantially as non toxic as the free amine from which they are derived are pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and are provided as a further embodiment of the invention.Such salts are those prepared with common inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid or perchloric acid.Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can also be prepared by reaction of the amines with organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, para toluenesulfonic acid or methanesulfonic acid, citric acid. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts also include the quaternary ammonium salts of amine bases of the formula I . Such salts can be prepared by reaction of a biphenylyl alkyl tertiary amine of the invention with an alkylating agent such as a C16 alkyl halide, C16 alkyl sulfate, or C16 alkyl benzene sulfate. Typical alkylating agents commonly used to form acceptable quaternary ammonium salts include methyl bromide, n butyl iodide, isopentyl chloride, dimethylsulfate, ethyl benzenesulfate and diisopropylsulfate. The compounds of formula I may be prepared by a reacting a ketone of formula II EMI4.1 with a Grignard reagent of formula EMI5.1 where X1 is chloro, bromo or iodo and n is 3 or 4, to produce a compound of formula I in which RÚ is hydroxy and Z is CH2 n where n is 3 or 4 b reducing a compound of formula II EMI5.2 to form a compound of formula I where R1 is hydroxy and Z is CH2 n where n is 3 or 4 c reducing a ketone of formula III EMI5.3 to form a compound of formula I in which R1 is hydroxy and R2 is hydrogen d alkylating a nitrile of formula IV EMI5.4 with an aminoalkylating agent of formula EMI6.1 where A is a leaving group to form a compound of formula I where R1 is C N e hydrolyzing a nitrile of formula V EMI6.2 to form a compound of formula I in which R1 is CONH2 or COOH f condensing an epoxide of formula VI EMI6.3 with an amine of formula HNR3R4, where R1is as defined above or is a protected hydroxyl group followed, if appropriate, by removal of the protecting groups or g reducing an olefin of formulaEMI7.1 to form a compound of formula I in which R1 is hydrogen and Z is CH2 n where n is 2 to 4. The biphenylyl alkanolamines provided by this invention, compounds having the above general formula wherein R1 is hydroxy, can be prepared directly by reaction of a biphenyl aldehyde or a biphenyl alkyl ketone with an aminoalkyl Grignard reagent. Such reaction is depicted by the following scheme EMI7.2 wherein X, XÚ, R2, R3 and R4 are as defined above and n is 3 or 4. The reaction can be effected by combining approximately equimolar quantities of the biphenyl aldehyde or biphenyl alkyl ketone with an appropriately substituted aminopropyl or aminobutyl magnesium halide in an inert organic solvent, usually an ethereal solvent such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran. When the reaction is carried out at reflux temperature, it normally is substantially complete within four to eight hours.The reaction will normally be effected at a temperature in the range of 250 to 1100C. An alternative, and preferred process for preparing the biphenylyl butanolamines of this invention, comprises reacting a biphenyl aldehyde or biphenyl alkyl ketone with a suitably N substituted aminoalkynyl carbanion to form the corresponding biphenylyl alkynylamine, followed by exhaustive reduction to provide the compound of the invention. Such process can be depicted as follows EMI8.1 wherein X, R2, R3 and R4 have the above defined meanings.The process can be carried out by first reacting about equimolar quantities of a biphenyl aldehyde or biphenyl alkyl ketone with an aminoalkynyl carbanion formed by reaction of the corresponding aminoalkyne with a strong base. Strong bases commonly employed to form the propynyl carbanion include methyl lithium, butyl lithium, methyl or ethyl magnesium bromide and triphenylmethyl sodium. The biphenyl aldehyde or ketone generally is mixed with the aminoalkyne and strong base in an unreactive organic solvent such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran, typically at a reduced temperature of about 80 to about 500C. The alkynyl carbanion is formed in situ and then reacts with the aldehyde or ketone. The reaction mixture typically is stirred at a reduced temperature for about one hour, and is then heated to reflux and stirred for an additional eight to ten hours.The intermediate biphenylyl alkynylamine which is formed can be isolated by diluting the reaction mixture with water, thereby decomposing any unreacted carbanion, and then separating the organic layer and removing the solvent therefrom. The biphenylyl alkynylamine is next reduced to yield the corresponding biphenylyl alkylamine of the invention. Such exhaustive reduction typically is carried out by hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium or platinum. For example, a biphenylyl butynylamine such as N isopentyl 4 hydroxy 4 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl 2 butynylamine is dissolved in a suitable organic solvent such as methanol or ethanol and stirred for about two to four hours at 200 to 500C. under a hydrogen atmosphere, in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst such as palladium suspended on carbon. The reduced product, for instance N isopentyl 4 hydroxy 4 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl butylamine, is isolated by filtering the reaction mixture to remove the catalyst and then evaporating the reaction solvent from the filtrate.The reduction is preferably effected at a temperature within the range 25 to 1100C. normally at or about room temperature. The above described process is a preferred method for preparing the 4 hydroxy 4 l,l biphenyl2 yl butylamines of the invention. A preferred method for preparing the 3 hydroxy 3 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl propylamines embraced by the invention comprises reacting a biphenyl alkyl ketone with an amine in the presence of formaldehyde according to Mannich reaction conditions to afford a 3 oxo 3 biphenylylpropylamine, followed by reduction of the oxo group. For example, a biphenyl methyl ketone such as 2 acetyl 5 fluoro l,1 biphenyl can be reacted with an excess of formaldehyde and an amine of the formula HNR3 R4 in a suitable solvent such as ethanol.The formaldehyde typically is introduced as an aqueous solution of formaldehyde, or as the solid trimer i.e. trioxymethylene or as the solid polymer i.e. polyoxymethylene . The reaction usually is carried out employing a secondary amine such as dimethylamine, methyl ethylamine, diisopropylamine, methyl benzylamine, pyrrolidine or piperidine, thereby avoiding any undesired side reactions which might occur in the presence of a primary amine or ammonia. The reaction normally is conducted at reflux temperature, and routinely is complete within about six to twelve hours. The product, a 3 oxo 3 biphenylylpropylamine of formula III can be isolated by evaporation of the reaction solvent, followed by crystallization of the amine, generally as an acid addition salt.The 3oxo 3 biphenylylpropylamine thus formed next is reduced by reaction with any of a number of chemical reducing agents, including sodium borohydride, or by catalytic hydrogenation using for instance palladium or platinum as catalysts. This reduction will normally be effected at a temperature in the range 250 to 1000C. The biphenylyl aminoalkyl nitriles of this invention, compounds defined by the above formula I wherein R1 is CEN, can be prepared by alkylating a l,l biphenyl 2 yl acetonitrile with an aminoalkyl alkylating agent. The reaction can be illustrated by the following reaction schedule EMI11.1 in which X, R2, R3 and R4 are as defined above, n is 2 to 4 and A is a leaving group such as chloro, bromo, iodo, azido, para toluenesulfonyl or methanesulfonyl. The alkylation can be accomplished by first reacting the biphenylyl acetonitrile with a strong base such as sodium or potassium amide, potassium tert butoxide, sodium dimsyl or lithium diisopropylamide in an inert organic solvent such as toluene, benzene, diethyl ether, xylene or tetrahydrofuran. The strong base reacts with, the biphenylyl acetonitrile to form a reactive carbanion which, upon addition of the aminoalkyl alkylating agent to the reaction mixture, displaces the leaving group of the alkylating agent and provides a compound of formula I . The alkylation reaction can be effected at any temperature within the range 300 to 1500C. and for instance typically is complete within eight to sixteen hours when carried out at the reflux temperature of toluene. The product, a 4 cyano 4biphenylylbutylamine or a 3 cyano 3 biphenylylpropylamine, can be isolated by simply diluting the reaction mixture with water and extracting the product into a suitable solvent such as benzene or diethyl ether. The biphenylyl aminoalkyl nitriles thus formed are valuable not only as antiarrhythmic agents, but additionally serve as intermediates leading to other compounds of this invention. For example, acid.hydrolysis of a biphenylyl aminoalkyl nitrile converts the nitrile moiety to a carboxamide or a carboxylic acid group, depending upon the reaction conditions.For example, reaction of a biphenylyl aminoalkylnitrile such as N,N di n butyl 3 cyano 3 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl propylamine with an acid such as ninety percent v v aqueous sulfuric acid for about two to about four hours at a temperature of about 80 to 1200C. converts the cyano group to a carboxamide, thus providing, for instance, N,N di n butyl 3 aminocarbonyl 3 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl propylamine. When the reaction is carried out for a longer period of time, for instance for about eight hours or longer, the product is the corresponding carboxylic acid, namely N,N di n butyl3 hydroxycarbonyl 3 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl propylamine.The carboxamide product can be isolated by neutralizing the reaction mixture by the addition of a base such as sodium hydroxide, followed by extraction of the product into a water immiscible solvent such as diethyl ether.Evaporation of the organic solvent then affords the product, generally as a solid which can be crystallized from common solvents such as hexane or Skelly B. The acids can be isolated by ion exchange chromatography.In both cases the hydrolysis is preferably effected at a temperature within the range from 500 to 1500C. The acids thus formed can be converted into the corresponding C14 alkyl esters by dissolving them in a C 1 4 alkanol saturated with HC1 and effecting the well known FischerSpeier esterification. The 2 hydroxy 4 biphenylylbutylamines of this invention, i.e. compounds of formula I where Z isEMI13.1 can be prepared by reacting an amine of the formula HNR R with a 4 biphenylyl 1,2 epoxybutane.The epoxybutane can be derived by peracid oxidation of the corresponding 4 biphenylyl l butene, which in turn is prepared by coupling an allyl halide with a biphenylyl methyl halide. The overall reaction is depicted by the following scheme EMI14.1 in which X, R3 and R are as defined above, and halo is chloro, bromo or iodo. Compounds of formula VI can be derived from starting materials of formula VII EMI14.2 The formula VII compounds are prepared by the reaction of an aldehyde of formula EMI15.1 with a Grignard reagent of formula CH2 CH CH2 MgBr see Org. Syn., 3, 121 The hydroxy compound of formula VII can be converted to the corresponding nitrile, amide or carboxylic acid by conventional techniques, e.g.bromination with PBr3, followed by reaction with NaCN to generate the corresponding nitrile and optional hydrolysis to produce the amide or carboxylic acid derivatives. Such compounds may be converted into the corresponding epoxides by treatment with meta perchlorobenzoic acid. For conversion of the formula VII compound to the epoxide it may be necessary to first protect the OH group for example forming the silyl ether see Syn. Comm., 6, 277, 1976 .EMI15.2 The silyl ether epoxide when formed may be reacted directly with the amine HNR 3R4 to produce the derived compound R1 is OH or can first be deprotected. The condensation of the amine with the 4 biphenylyl 1,2 epoxybutane is generally accomplished by mixing the epoxide with about a two to three molar excess of the amine in an inert organic solvent such as ethanol. The reaction can be carried out in a bomb at a temperature of from 100 to 2000C., and generally at such temperatures is substantially complete within eight to sixteen hours. Less vigorous reaction conditions may also be utilized. The product can be isolated by evaporation of the reaction solvent, and further purification is accomplished by distillation, salt formation or the like. Biphenylylalkylamines defined by the above general formula wherein RÚ is hydrogen and Z is CH2 n can be preapred form the corresponding biphenylyl alkanolamines wherein RÚ is hydroxy by dehydration to form the corresponding biphenylyl alkenylamine, followed by reduction of the olefinic double bond. For example, a biphenylyl alkanolamine such as N methyl N 2 phenethyl 3 hydroxy 3 5 bromo 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl propylamine can be dehydrated by reaction with sulfuric acid to provideN methyl N 2 phenethyl 3 5 gbromo 1,1 biphenyl 2yl 2 propenylamine. Hydrogenation of the latter compound over a suitable catalyst such as palladium on carbon affords the corresponding biphenylyl alkylamine, namely N Methyl N 2 phenylthyl 3 5 bromo 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl propylamine. Compounds of formula I in which R1 ls CONR5R6, where one or both of R5 and R6 representC1 6 alkyl groups, can be prepared by reacting the corresponding acid chloride or ester derivative, i.e. a compound of formula I in which R1 is an ester or acid chloride moiety, with excess of a primary or secondary amine of formula HNR5R6. The biphenylyl alkylamines comprehended by this invention which bear readily removable groups on the amine nitrogen atom i.e. R3 or R4 is a readily removable group are useful both as antiarrhythmic agents and as intermediates. Typical nitrogen substituents which are readily removable include methyl and benzyl. For example, an N benzyl amine can be de benzylated by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium on carbon. N methyl amines can be de methylated by reaction with a haloformate followed by basic hydrolysis. Any of the above described processes for preparing compounds of the invention can be carried out so as to provide N methyl or N benzyl biphenylyl alkylamines. Such compounds can be de methylated or de benzylated to provide compounds of the above general formula wherein one or both of R and R4 are hydrogen. Such compounds then can be re alkylated as desired to provide any of a number of the other compounds of the invention. For example, a compound such as N benzyl N isopropyl 4 cyano 4 5 chloro l, 1 bi phenyl 2 yl butylamine can be de benzylated by hydrogenation to provide the corresponding secondary amine, N isopropyl 4 cyano 4 5 chloro 1 , 1 biphenyl 2 yllbutylamine. The secondary amine then can be realkylated, for instance by reaction with an alkyl halide such as n pentyl bromide or n propyl iodide, an alkenyl halide such as allyl bromide, 3 pentenyl iodide or 2 methyl 2 butenyl bromide, or with a phenylalkyl halide such as 2 phenethyl bromide or 3 phenylpropyl iodide.Such an alkylation process is a con venient method for preparing a wide variety of biphenylyl alkylamines from a common starting material. As already pointed out, the biphenylyl alkylamines provided by this invention are basic in nature and thus react with acids to form pharmaceuticallyacceptable acid addition salts. The salts are prepared by simply mixing the biphenylyl alkylamines with appropriate acids in suitable organic solvents such as diethyl ether. The acid addition salts normally crystallize out of solution and can be collected by filtration and recrystallized if desired. When the biphenyl alkylamines comperehended by this invention are tertiary amines, i.e. when R3 andR4 in the above general formula both are other than hydrogen, quaternary ammonium salts are readily formed by reaction with a lower alkyl alkylating agent. For example, reaction of a tertiary amine such as N,N dimethyl 3 aminocarbonyl 3 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl propyl amine with an alkylating agent such as allyl bromide in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane effects quaternization to afford N allyl N,N dimethyl 3 amino carbonyl 3 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl propylammonium bromide.Such quaternary salts are characteristically highly crystalline solids, and are included within the scope of this invention as antiarrhythmic agents. The following list of l,l biphenyl 2 yl propyl and butylamines is illustrative of the compounds comprehended and provided by this invention. N isopropyl 4 hydroxy 4 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl butylamine N methyl N n propyl 4 hydroxy 4 5 fluoro 1,1 1 biphenyl 2 yl butylamine N n hexyl 4 cyano 4 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl butylamine N,N dimethyl 3 hydroxy 3 l,l biphenyl 2 yl propylamine N allyl 3 cyano 3 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl propyl amine N 3 hexenyl N 2 phenethyl 4 aminocarbonyl4 5 bromo 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl butylamine N,N di n propyl 4 hydroxycarbonyl 4 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl butylamine N,N diisopropyl 3 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl propylaminium chloride N tert butyl 4 5 bromo 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl 2 hydroxybutylamine N isopentyl N methyl 4 hydroxy 4 methyl 4 5 chloro 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl butylamine N,N,N trimethyl 3 hydroxy 3 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl propylammonium bromide d N,N diethyl 4 aminocarbonyl 4 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl butamine 1 N,N di n pentyl 4 hydroxycarbonyl 4 5bromo l,l biphenyl 2 yl butylamine d1 N,N di n hexyl 4 cyano 4 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl butylamine N 3 pentenyl N n propyl 3 cyano 3 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl propylamine N ethyl N methyl N n propyl 4 cyano 4 5 chloro l,l biphenyl 2 yl butylammonium tosylate N 3 phenylpropyl N allyl 4 hydroxycarbonyl4 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl butylaminium acetate N,N dimethyl 4 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl 2 hydroxybutylaminium citrate 1 3 cyano 3 5 fluoro 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl propyllpiperidine N,N diethyl 4 hydroxycarbonyl 4 5 fluoro l, 1 biphenyl 2 yl butylamine N benzyl N isopropyl 3 aminocarbonyl 3 l,l biphenyl 2 yl propylamine 1 3 methylpentyl 1 ethyl 4 aminocarbonyl 4 l,l biphenyl 2 yl pyrrolidinium phosphate N allyl N 3 phenylpropyl N n propyl 4 methyl 4 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl 2 hydroxybutylammonium iodide and N benzyl N 2 phenethyl 3 cyano 3 1,1 biphenyl 2 yl propylamine. The biphenylyl alkylamines of this invention are useful as antiarrhythmic agents. That the compounds of the invention are potent antiarrhythmic agents has been demonstrated in dogs suffering from ouabain induced cardiac arrhythmias. In a typical experiment, one or more mongrel dogs of either sex were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. A 23 guageButterfly infusion needle was placed in the radial vein for the introduction into the dog of sufficient ouabain to induce an arrhythmia, and for the introduction into the dog of the test compound. Each dog was continuously monitored throughout the experiment by electrocardiogram.After the ouabain induced cardiac arrhythmia had continued for thirty minutes, a compound of this invention was administered via the Butterfly infusion needle at the rate of 200 g per kilogram of dog body weight per minute. If the arrhythmia was not converted to a normal sinus rhythm within ten minutes from the initial administration of test compound, as observed by electrocardiogram, the rate of infusion of test compound was increased to 500 pg per kilogram per minute.When an arrhythmia conversion was noted, the infusion of test compound in general was continued until twice the amount of such compound which effected the conversion was administered to the dog. Following the complete administration of test compound to the dog, the dog s heart was monitored by electrocardiogram until such time that an arrhythmia returned to the dog s heart, or for a maximum time of two hours, at which time the experiment was terminated. The results of several experiments are set out in the following table. Each compound listed in the table, and its corresponding biological evaluation, is designated by alphabetical letter given in the column marked compound . Most of the compounds were evaluated more than once, as indicated in the No. ofDogs column. The amount of ouabain needed to induce an arrhythmia is given in jjg per kilogram of dog body weight. The converting dose and total dose of test compound are given in mg. per kilogram of animal body weight.Duration of conversion is recorded in minutes.

The compounds of the invention can be administered parenterally, for example in the form of liquid injectable solutions or suspensions, or orally in the form of solid compositions which are molded into tablets or encapsulated in gelatin capsules. Pharmaceutical carriers, diluents and excipients commonly used for formulating solid compositions include starch, glucose, lactose, gelatin, malt, rice flour, silica gelr hydroxyethyl cellulose, magnesium carbonate, sodium benzoate and related carriers. Carriers employed in liquid formulations include ethanol, saline, sterile water, glucose syrup, syrup of acacia, peanut oil, wheat germ oil, sorbitan trioleate, ethyl oleate, lecithin and the like. The injectable compositions can be formulated for convenient parenteral administration via the intramuscular, subcutaneous or, preferably, the intravenous routes. The effective amount of antiarrhythmic agent to be administered may vary depending upon the route of administration, whether or not a subject is suffering from an arrhythmia at the time of administration, the severity of the arrhythmia, the patient being treated and related factors. A subject suffering from an arrhythmia and in need of treatment normally is administered a dose of antiarrhythmic agent sufficient to effect a conversion to normal sinus rhythm. The compound of this invention typically is formulated for parenteral administration and is infused intravenously at a dose effective for causing a conversion of the arrhythmia. The compound then is administered as a maintenance dose, either parenterally or orally. The dose of active compound routinely used to effect a conversion of an arrhythmia is from about 0.1 to about 50 mg. per kg of animal body weight.A typical converting dose administered intravenously is from about 0.5 to about 20 mg. per kg. Maintenance therapy is accomplished by administering an active compound of this invention at the rate of from about 0.1 to about 35 mg. per kg. of animal body weight. A tablet well suited for oral maintenance therapy or prophylactic treatment of a human subject may contain, for example, from about 7 to about 750 mg. of a biphenylyl alkylamine of this invention in combination with a suitable carrier. Such tablet can be administered to such human at the rate of about one to three times each day for the effective control of cardiac arrhythmia. The following non limiting examples will further illustrate the invention.
