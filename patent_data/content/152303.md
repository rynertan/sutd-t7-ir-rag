# PHOTOGRAPHIC ASSEMBLAGE FOR PROVIDING A MONOCHROMATIC DYE IMAGE

## Abstract
A photographic assemblage is described for producing a monochromatic dye image comprising a a photosensitive element comprising a support hav ing thereof a layer of nondiffusible dye image providing material, a stripping layer, an opaque layer and a silver halide emulsion layer b a transparent cover sheet and c opaque processing composition for application be tween the element and cover sheet. A dye mordant layer may also be present on the element or cover sheet. After exposure and processing, the layer of nondiffusible dye image providing material on a support is stripped away to provide a monochromatic retained dye image without the need for bleaching and fixing.
