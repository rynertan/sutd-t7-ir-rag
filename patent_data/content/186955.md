# HEAVY OIL DISTILLATION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A process for separating and recovering condensed and absorbed coke drum vapor from residual material leaving a coker combination tower to increase distillate yield. A resid flash tower 25 , between the coker combination tower 7 and the coker furnace 39 , recovers high value absorbed or condensed liquid product from the coker feed.

## Claims
1. A delayed coking process wherein hot vapors from a coke drum 9 enter a distillation column 7 and are quenched with coker feed of petroleum resid to heat the coker feed by direct heat exchange of hot coke drum vapor with coker feed and produce a preheated coker feed with some condensed or absorbed coke drum vapor which is charged to the coker characterized by charging the preheated coker feed to a vacuum distillation column 25 and removing at least a portion of the condensed or absorbed coke drum vapor from the preheated coker feed, to produce a stripped coker feed.

## Description
This invention relates to separating absorbed coke drum vapors from coker combination tower residuum. Crude oil is usually fractionated in an atmospheric distillation tower. Gasoline and lighter materials are recovered as overhead products. Heavy naphtha, kerosene and gas oils are taken off as side streams and residual material is recovered from the bottom of the atmospheric tower as reduced crude. The reduced crude is usually charged to a vacuum distillation tower which produces vacuum gas oils and a heavy residual liquid known as vacuum reduced crude or resid. The resid is not worth much, so it is frequently fed to a coker. The coker converts the resid into coke a solid and lighter, distillate liquid products which are far more valuable than the resid. The resid is usually fed into the coker via the coker combination tower. The resid quenches, and recovers heat from, hot vapor from the coke drum. Residual crude, which is preheated by quenching the hot vapor, is then fed to the coker. Typical prior art distillation techniques are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,501,400 3,886,062 4,239,618 and 4,261,814. A typical coker combination tower and coke drum is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,917,564. When resid quenches coke drum vapor in a coker combination tower, some of the coke drum vapor condenses and or is absorbed by the resid and is recycled to the coker. Some of this recycled vapor ends up as coke in the coke drum, at the expense of higher value liquid product. The present invention recovers condensed and absorbed coke drum vapor from the resid quench to obtain increased distillate yield. This is accomplished by passing the resid stream from the coker combination tower through an auxiliary distillation tower, hereafter the resid flash tower. Accordingly, the present invention provides a delayed coking process wherein hot vapors from a coker enter a distillation column and are quenched with petroleum resid feed to heat the coker feed by direct heat exchange of hot coker vapor with coker feed and produce a preheated coker feed which contains some condensed or absorbed coker vapor which is charged to a coker characterized by charging the preheated coker feed to a vacuum distillation column and removing at least a portion of the condensed or absorbed coker vapor from the preheated coker feed, to produce a stripped coker feed with reduced coker vapor content. The Figure is a process flowsheet of a heavy oil vacuum distillation system of the present invention. An atmospheric distillation tower resid or similar heavy oil is preheated in a furnace not shown and fed into a lower portion of main vacuum distillation tower 1. Vacuum resid is withdrawn via line 3 at 315 C 600 F and is fed into resid inlet 5 of coker combination tower 7. Resid, stripped of volatiles and further heated, is fed to coke drum 9 where coke is formed. There is some cracking and some volatilization of resid, generating coke drum vapor. The coke drum vapor, at 432 C 810 F , passes via line 11 to tower inlet 13, below resid inlet 5. The coke drum vapor passes up in a countercurrent, direct contact heat exchange relationship with resid fed into inlet 5. The resid quenches the coke drum vapor, preventing further cracking. The resid also condenses and absorbs a considerable amount of the vapor. Non absorbed coke drum vapors are fractionated in the tower 7 into heavy gas oil recovered via line 15, light gas oil recovered via line 17, naphtha recovered via line 19, and gas recovered via line 21. Resid is discharged via line 23. Pumparound heat exchanger 16 cools heavy gas oil from line 15 and recycles it to tower 7. Pumparound heat exchanger 18 cools and recycles the light gas oil. A side stripper 20 fractionates the light gas oil. An air fin cooler 22 cools the overhead vapors. Overhead drum 24 separates overhead liquid from vapor. Some of the liquid is refluxed to the column, and the remainder removed as product via line 19. Resid with absorbed coke drum vapor from tower 7 is pumped through line 23 by pump 24 through furnace 27 to the inlet 29 of resid flash tower 25. This tower has a lower fractionation zone 31 below resid inlet 29. An upper condensing zone 33, cooled by a pumparound heat exchanger 34 positioned in a stream from line 35, is above inlet 29. In resid flash tower 25, absorbed coke drum vapors are flashed or recovered from the resid. The stripped resid is withdrawn from the bottom of tower 25 via line 37 and charged through furnace 39 to coke drum 9. A clean distillate product of virgin gas oil and condensed coke drum vapor is recovered as a liquid from the upper condensing zone 33 of tower 25 via line 36. Reflux is provided by recirculating and cooling a portion of the clean distillate via line 35. Lighter hydrocarbons and water vapor are withdrawn through top vapor outlet 40. Vacuum is maintained in the tower by a steam jet ejector not shown . The pressure in the resid flash tower may range from 0.5 mm Hg 67 Pa to 20 mm Hg 2666 Pa , preferably 0.5 mm Hg 67 Pa to 10 mm 1333 Pa . There can be a pressure differential of from 2 mm Hg 267 Pa to 5 mm Hg 666 Pa from the upper zone to the lower zone in tower 25. The operation of coker combination tower 7 is conventional. Temperatures of 412 C 775 F to 454 C 850 F and pressures of 200 kPa 15 psig to 520 kPa 60 psig are common. The resid feed is generally 149 C 300 F to 371 C 700 F . The coke drum vapors fed to tower 7 generally are at 413 C 775 F to 454 C 850 F . The quenching of coke drum vapors with resid in tower 7 is well known. The invention is stripping the resid from the combination tower of absorbed or condensed coke drum vapor, and recovering valuable liquid product from the resid. The condensate and some virgin gas oil are recovered in flash tower 25. The upper zone of this tower recovers high value distillate and prevents its recycle to, and partial destruction in, the coker. Preferably at least a majority of the absorbed or condensed coke drum vapors are recovered in the flash tower. Even more preferably 70 or 80 or 90 or more of the adsorbed condensed material is recovered. A fringe benefit of the present invention is greater recovery of distillate material left in the resid feed to the coker. This may occur when feed properties change, or if there is some problem in the vacuum column used to produce the resid fraction fed to the coker. The following example is based on pilot plant studies. In a 0.183 m³ s refinery 100,000 B D , the main vacuum distillation tower is operated to produce 0.039 m³ s 25,000 B D of vacuum resid. Stream conditions for the resid flash tower are shown in Table 1. Tower 25 operates at an absolute pressure of about 3 mm Hg 400 Pa in the lower fractionating zone, and an absolute pressure of about 1 mm Hg 133.3 Pa above the upper condensing zone. The distillate products recovered from the upper condensing zone may be used as heating oil, diesel fuel or fed to a fluid catalytic cracking FCC , catalytic dewaxing, or other downstream processing unit. The distillate recovered from the resid substantially increases the total distillate recovered from the system.
