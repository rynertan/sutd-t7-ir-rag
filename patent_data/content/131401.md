## Description
NOVEL AMINE CURING AGENTS AND EPOXY RESINS CURED THEREWITH This invention relates to curing agents for epoxy resins and more particularly to amines of the type heretofore known for use as curing agents for epoxy resins modified by the incorporation into such amines of a solid polyethylene terephthalate. The resulting composition is used to cure epoxy resins of the type heretofore known in the art. it is known to use amines such as aliphatic or aromatic amines for the curing of epoxy resins as shown, for example in Waddill U.S. Patent No. 4,139,524 and Marquis et al. U.S.Patent No. 4,162,358. See also, the textbook Handbook ofEpoxy Resins by H. Lee and K. Neville, McGraw Hill BookCo., 1967. There is significant technical literature on this subject as illustrated, for example by a technical brochure entitled JeffamineR Polyoxypropyleneamines , Copyright 1978 by Jefferson Chemical Company, Inc. An extensive body of technical knowledge has arisen relating to the preparation of solid polyethylene terephthalate from suitable monomers such as ethylene glycol and dimethylterephthalate. Typical polymers are known to have outstanding toughness and dielectric properties. These materials are useful in forming sheet, film and fibers as well as injection moldings and extrusions. Polyethylene terephthalate is widely used in the manufacture of beverage bottles and the disposal of used bottles in an environmentally acceptable manner presents a major problem. One proposed solution has been to convert the used polymer into an unsaturated polyester that can be used to make moldings such as boat hulls Plastics Technology, September 1981 . The used bottles are reported to have been used as raw materials in the manufacture of industrial strappings, fiber fill for pillows, sleeping bags and the like, synthetic lumber and corrugated rubber C News,January 5, 1981, p. 30 . In one aspect the present invention is directed to modified i.e., extended amine curing agents which are prepared by dissolving a polyethylene terephthalate resin in an amine of the type used for curing epoxy resins. The polyethylene terephthalate can be incorporated into the amine by comminuting the polyethylene terephthalate and adding this to the amine at an elevated temperature such as a temperature within the range of about 1000 to about 2500C. In another aspect the present invention is directed to the use of extended amine curing agents for curing epoxy resins. The principal components of the compositions and methods of the present invention are the epoxy resin, the amine curing agent and the polyethylene terephthalate used to extend the amine. Generally the vicinal epoxide compositions that can be cured using the curing agents of this invention are organic materials having an average of more than one reactive 1,2 epoxide group. These polyepoxide materials can be monomeric or polymeric, saturated or unsaturated, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic, and may be substituted if desired with other substituents besides the epoxy groups, e.g., hydroxyl groups, ether radicals, halogenated phenyl groups and the like. The most widely used epoxy resins are.diglycidyl ethers of bisphenol A EMI3.1 where n equals an integer of up to about 10 to 20. However, these epoxides are representative of the broader class of epoxide compounds that are useful in making epoxy resins. A widely used class of polyepoxides that can be cured according to the practice of the present invention includes the resinous epoxy polyethers obtained by reacting an epihalohydrin, such as epichlorohydrin, and the like, with either a polyhydric phenol or a polyhydric alcohol. An illustrative, but by no means exhaustive, listing of suitable dihydric phenols includes 4,4 isopropylidene bisphenol, 2, 4 dihydroxydiphenylethylmethane, 3,3 dihydroxydiphenyl diethy lmethane, 3,4 dihydroxydiphenylmethylpropylmethane, 2 ,3 dihydroxydiphenylethylphenylmethane, 4,4 dihydroxy dipheny lmethane, 4,4 dihydroxyd ipheny 1 buty lpheny lmethane, 2,2 dihydroxydiphenyldito lylmethane, 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl tolylmethyl methane and the like.Other polyhydric phenols which may also be co reacted with an epihalohydrin to provide these epoxy polyethers are such compounds as resorcinol, hydroquinone, substituted hydroquinones, e.g., tertbutylhydroquinone, and the like. Among the polyhydric alcohols that can be co reacted with an epihalohydrin to provide the resinous epoxy polyethers are such compounds as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycols, pentane diols, bis 4 hydroxy cyclohexyl dimethylmethane, 1,4 dimethylolbenzene glycerol, 1,2, 6 hexanetriol, trimethylolpropane, mannitol, sorbitol, erythritol, pentaerythritol, their dimers, trimers and higher polymers, e.g., polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols, triglycerol, dipentaerythritol and the like, polyallyl alcohol, polyhydric thioethers, such as 2,2 , 3,3 tetrahydroxydipropylsulfide and the like, mercapto alcohols such as a monothioglycerol, a,a dithioglycerol, and the like, polyhydric alcohol partial esters, such as monostearin, pentaerythritol monoacetate, and the like, and halogenated polyhydric alcohols such as the monochlorohydrins of glycerol, sorbitol, pentaerythritol and the like. Another class of polymeric polyepoxides that can be cured by means of the above described curing agents includes the epoxy novolac resins obtained by reacting, preferably, in the presence of a basic catalyst, e.g., sodium or potassium hydroxide, an epihalohydrin, such as epichlorohydrin, with the resinous condensate of an aldehyde, e.g., formaldehyde, and either a monohydric phenol, e.g., phenol itself, or a polyhydric phenol. Further details concerning the nature and preparation of these epoxy novolac resins can be obtained in Lee, H. and Neville, K. Handbook of EpoxyResins . It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the polyepoxide compositions that can be cured according to the practice of the present invention are not limited to the above described polyepoxides, but that these polyepoxides are to be considered merely as being representative of the class of polyepoxides as a whole. The amount of curing agent that is employed in curing polyepoxide compositions will depend on the amine equivalent weight of the curing agent employed. The total number of equivalents of amine group is preferably from about 0.8 to about 1.2 times the number of epoxide equivalents present in the curable epoxy resin composition with a stoichiometric amount being most preferred. Various conventionally employed additives can be admixed with these polyepoxide containing compositions prior to final cure. For example, in certain instances it may be desired to add minor amounts of other co catalysts, or hardeners, along with the curing agent system herein described. Conventional pigments, dyes, fillers, flame retarding agents and other compatible natural and synthetic resins can also be added. Furthermore, known solvents for the polyepoxide materials such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, toluene, benzene, xylene, dioxane, methyl isobutyl ketone, dimethylformamide, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate, and the like, can be used if desired, or where necessary.THE AMINE CURING AGENT A curable epoxy resin composition is prepared by admixing one or more epoxides, as described above, with an epoxy interactive polyamine curing agent. The ratio of active amino hydrogens to epoxy groups in the admixture may suitably be in the range of about 0.5 2 1 and, preferably, in the range of about 0.8 1.2 1. Suitable polyamine curing agents are those that contain more than two active hydrogens per molecule. Examples of such curing agents are alkylene polyamines represented by the formula NH2C2H4 NHC2H4 nX where X is OH or NH2 and where n has the value of O to about 5. When X is NH2, such alkylene polyamines include ethylene diamine, diethylene triamine, triethylene tetramine, tetraethylene pentamine, pentaethylene hexamine, and the like. These polyamines provide admixtures having low viscosity and provide epoxy resin compositions that generally have good chemical resistance. When X is OH, representative amines include H2NC2H4NHC2H4NHCH2CH2OH, H2NCH2CH2NHC2H4NHC2H4NHC2B4NHCH2CH2 H Long chain polyamine adducts such as, for example, trimethyl 1,6 hexanediamine may also be used to impart color stability. Thus, broadly speaking, aromatic, alicyclic, heterocyclic, and aliphatic amines may be used as well as more complex amine compounds such as polyether polyamines, etc.Other examples include N aminoethylpiperazine, m phenylenediamine, 2,4 or 2,6 toluenediamine, etc. Another class of amines are amines derived from polyoxypropylene diols and triols. Thus, we employ polyoxypropylene diamines of the formula NH2HC CH3 CH2ioCH2CH CH3 ixNH2 wherein x is an integer of from about 2 to about 40. The most preferred polyoxypropylene diamines of the formula have average molecular weights between about 230, where x is an average of 2.6 to about 2,000 where x is an average of about 33.1. We may also use polyoxypropylene triamines of the formula EMI7.1 wherein x, y and z represent integers in the range of about 1 to 15, and the sum of x, y and z is from about 3 to about 50. Preferred polyoxypropylene triamines of the above formula have average molecular weights between about 190 to about 3,000. These polyoxypropylene di and triamines are readily available commercially in a wide variety of molecular weight ranges. Also useful are amines having the formula H2NCH CH3 CH2 OCH CH3 CH2 x OCH2CH2 y OCH2CH CH3 zNH2 where x z equals 2 to 10 and y is a number having a value from l to 50. Although not essential for the practice of this invention, the use of commonly known additives which enhance the color or properties of the epoxy resin may be used as desired. For example, chipped or milled glass fibers, chopped or milled carbon fibers and or other mineral fibers are useful.PREPARATION OF THE EXTENDED AMINE CURING AGENT In accordance with the present invention, a polyethylene terephthlate is comminuted and then dissolved in an amine curing agent of the type described herein. This is a straight forward operation that can be performed in any suitable reaction vessel such as an autoclave provided with agitation means and means for heating the contents of the crave. The desired quantity of the amine curing agent is placed in the vessel and brought to a desired temperature with agitation normally within the range of about 1000 to 2500C, preferably under an inert atmosphere.The temperature to be utilized will be, in part, a function of the temperature at which the polyethylene terephthalate will dissolve. It hays been found that this normally will occur at a temperature within the range of about 150 to about 240. In some situations the resultant solution may tend to separate into two or more layers. This does not present a problem so long as the layers are well mixed before the extended amine is added to the epoxy, as hereafter described. SPECIFIC EXAMPLES Example 1 A series of extended.amine curing agents was prepared by dissolving scrap polyethylene terephthalate in the desired amine in a reaction kettle at an appropriate temperature with agitation and heating. The polyethylene terephthalate used in this series of experiments was the type used to produce soft drink bottles. The amines that were used, the temperature of the solution and the amount of scrap polyethylene terephthalate PET incorporated are indicated in the following table. Table 1 Amine.

As can be seen in Table 3, the greatest decrease in gel time involved the use of a 20 wt solution of PET in isophoronediamine. This system was so reactive and so viscous that it could not be molded. Thus, no performance data are available. Example 3 A series of epoxy resin molding compositions containing solutions of PET resin in Jeff amine polyetheramines were prepared and cured.

Solutions with lower PET concentrations still give acceleration but the cured systems have higher impact strength and HDT values.Thus, properties of the system cured with a 5 wt solution of PET in D 230 were similar to those of the D 230 cured system. The IPDA.PET 95 5 cured system had a much shorter pot life than one cured with IPDA alone, but cured epoxy properties were nearly the same for the two systems. As will be seen by the foregoing specific examples, the extended amine curing agents of the present invention provide cured epoxy systems that are suitable for industrial applications.
