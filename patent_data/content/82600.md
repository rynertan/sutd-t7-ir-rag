# Oxygen enriched system.

## Abstract
An continuous oxygen enrichment system includes a separator 12 for separating pressurised air flow 16 into oxygen enriched gas glow 20 and oxygen depleted gas flow 18 which pressurised oxygen depleted flow is used to drive a turbine 26 which in turn drives a compressor for returning energy to the system by driving a compressor 30 for supplying the pressurised flow 16 or for pressuring the oxygen enriched flow 20 .
