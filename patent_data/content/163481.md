# Disc drive control apparatus for recording and or reproducing digital data.

## Abstract
A method of recording and or reproducing digital data on a rotary magnetic disc 2 under the condition that address data of the digital data are made non consecutive relative to an original time sequence thereof by adding error correction bits to the digital data and re arrangement of the digital data, includes providing a buffer memory 20 be tween the disc 2 and a peripheral device, the buffer memory 20 having a capacity capable of completing the re arrangement of the digital data, allocating the digital data to the buffer memory 20 such that actual data and the error correction bits are respectively stored in different memory areas of said buffer memory 20 , and converting address data upon writing or reading the digital data from the buffer memory 20 so as to allocate the address data such that the address data become non consecutive as seen from a recorded pattern of the disc 2 and consecutive as seen from the peripheral device.
