# Removal of sulfur and or sulfur compound from industrial process streams using metal alumina spinel.

## Abstract
A process wherein a particulate mass of a metal alumina spinel, MA1₂O₄ wherein M is chromium, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, cadmium or mercury, particularly zinc alumina spinel ZnA1₂O₄ , is contacted with a process stream which contains sulfur, sulfur compounds and or other contaminants. There after the sulfur, sulfur compounds and or other contamin ants, are readily desorbed, or removed from said particulate mass of metal alumina spine by contacting, and purging same with a relatively clean gas stream, suitably hydrogen, hydrogen containing gas, or an inert gas, at elevated temper ature.
