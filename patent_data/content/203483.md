## Description
The present invention relates to polymeric blends based on vinyl aromatic polymers showing high tenacity and chemical resistance. More particularly, the present invention relates to blends based on vinyl aromatic polymers having high tenacity and chemical resistance suitable to be transformed into shaped bodies endowed with self extinguishing and good physical properties. As known, vinyl aromatic polymers are thermoplastic resins suitable to be transformed in warmth into shaped bodies by injection or extrusion molding. Said vinyl aromatic poly mers have a fair tenacity, but they are not suitable to be used in applications where a high tenacity associated with a good chemical resistance are required. A way to improve these lacking properties is to provide blendswith other polymers, having the necessary properties to give a material showing the desired combination of pro perties. However, this approach has been successful only in a limited number of cases in fact, the blending re sults in combining the worst characteristics of each com ponent, the result being a material of such poor proper ties as not to be of any practical or commercial value. The reasons for this failure are due to the fact that not all polymers are compatible with each other and therefore do not perfectly adhere. As a result, interfaces are formed among the components of the blend, which represent weakness and breaking points. EP A 21537 discloses thermoplastic moulding compositions with enhanced fire resistant characteristics, composed of vinyl chloride polymers as a graft copolymer of a vinyl aromatic and a nitrile monomer on a synthetic rubber like polymer and a zinc titanium IV oxide compound as fire retardant. Mechanical and chemical properties of the prepared composit ions are not given particular attention in said document. The applicant has now found that tenacity and chemical resistance of vinyl aromatic polymers can be improved, without modifying substantially the other mechanical pro perties, by intimately mixing Preferably, the blends contain from 25 to 75 ty weight of a vinylchloride polymer and from 25 to 75 by weight of a viny aromatic copolymer containing copolymerized an ethylenically unsatured nitrile and a quantity not exceeding 15 by weight of rubber. The term viny aromatic copolymer as used in the present invention and claims is to be understood to include any solid thermoplastic polymer and respective copolymer essentially consisting of, i.e. containing chemically bound, at least 50 by weight of one or more vinyl aromatic compounds of general formula wherein X represents hydrogen or an alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms n is zero or an integer from 1 to 5 and Y represents halogen, e.g. fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine or an alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, i.e. the methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl groups, the two last mentioned groups being straight chain or branched. Examples of vinyl aromatic compounds having the above re ported general formula are styrene, methyl styrene, mono , di , tri , tetra and penta chlorostyrene and the respective alpha methyl styrenes, styrenes alkylated in the nucleus and the respective alpha methyl styrenes such as ortho and para methyl styrene, ortho and para ethyl styrenes ortho and para methyl alpha methyl styrenes, etc. These monomers may be used either alone or in admixture with each other copolymerizable co monomers such as, for instance, maleic anhydride. Rubbers are used for making the vinyl aromatic polymers impact or shock resistant and, according to the present invention, they are present in a quantity not exceeding 15 by weight. Quantities comprised between 2 and 12 by weight are preferred. The rubbers which are used to this purpose are poly buta diene, poly isoprene, copolymers of butadiene and or iso prene with styrene or with other monomers, or the saturated rubbers such as ethylene propylene rubber, ethylene pro pylene diene terpolymers and silicon rubbers containing unsaturated groups, etc. As ethylenically unsaturated nitrile copolymerized with vinyl aromatic monomers it is to be understood firstly and preferably acrylonitrile. Other ethylenically unsaturated monomers, such as methacrylonitrile, can be advantageously used. The modified vinyl aromatic copolymers can be obtained ac cording to any known polymerization process, such as sus pension, bulk suspension or continuous bulk polymerization, provided that the above mentioned compounds are used as starting monomers. Said modified vinyl aromatic copolymers differ from the known acrylonitrile butadiene styrene resins, known as ABS resins, as far as the morphology, structure and size of the rubber particles dispersed in the rigid polymeric matrix are concerned. As consequence of such morphological difference, the blends of the present invention display a resilience or impact resistance higher than that of the ABS resins, especially when the content in rubber is lower than 15 and preferably lower than 10 by weight. Vinylchloride polymers to be used in the blends of the pre sent invention may be either the vinylchloride homopolymer or copolymers thereof containing less amounts of other co polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated compounds. Although vinylchloride homopolymers are preferred in the embodiment of the present invention, vinylchloride copoly mers containing up to 20 by weight of other copolymer izable unsaturated compounds can be also used. Suitable copolymerizable unsaturated compounds may be, for instance, vinylidene chloride, vinylidene bromide, vinylidene fluoro chloride and so like unsaturated hydrocarbons such as ethylene, propylene, isobutene allyl compounds such as allylacetate, allylchloride, allyl ethyl ether vinyl esters such as vinylacetate, vinylpropionate acrylic or meth acrylic acid and their esters containing from 1 to 8 car bon atoms in the alkyl group, acrylonitrile etc. Instead of a single unsaturated monomer of the above de scribed type, mixtures of said comonomers can be used, provided that these comonomers are not used in amounts ex ceeding 20 and do not substantially modify the proper ties of polyvinylchloride. The blends of the present invention may be prepared by mixing them at low or high temperature in any known type of mixer. For instance quick mixers Henschel type , single screw or double screw extruders, Banbury mixers, mixing rollers, etc. may be used. If the blend is prepared at high temperature, temperatures comprised between 140 and 200 C can be used up to obtain a homogeneous and uniform composition. The compositions may comprise little amounts, generally comprised between 1 and 5 by weight of a stabilizer or other additives intimately mixed. Suitable stabilizers are lead basic carbonate, lead dibasic stearate, lead tribasic phosphate, lead dibasic phosphate, cadmium stearate, cad mium laurate, cadmium ricinolate, glyceryl monostearate, dibutyltin mercaptide and organo tin compounds containing sulfur such as for instance, dibutyl tin S,S bis 3,5,5 trimethylhexylmercaptoacetate . Other additives such as plasticizers, lubricants, anti flame agents, flowing agents, anti static agents, dye stuffs, pigments, foaming agents to provide lighter bodies and semi finished products may be added during the mixing step of the components, in quantities ranging from 0.1 to 10 by weight. The blends of the present invention can be easily processed and show a set of properties which on the whole are better than those of the single components. For this reason, the polymeric blends of the present invention find a useful application for obtaining materials endowed with high tenacity combined with high chemical and flame resistance up to be self extinguishing. Therefore, said blends are used in the field of domestic electric apparatus and app liances, electronics and generally in the field of tech nical materials in form of films, sheets, tapes, bands, rods, boxes, cups, containers, etc. The blends may be used to provide foamed articles by the techniques known in the art.
