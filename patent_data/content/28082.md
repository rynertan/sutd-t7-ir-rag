# Treatment of semiconductor materials and their use as electrodes in photoelectrochemical cells.

## Abstract
The surface electronic properties of a semiconductor, gen erally a chalcogenide, are improved by immersing the semi conductor in an electrolyte in which it is relatively stable in the dark but unstable as a photoelectrode under illumination and the semiconductor is illuminated and thereby photoelectro chemically etched. The surface properties of metal semicon ductors can also be improved by immersion in an aqueous so lution containing Zn and or Cr ions. The products are useful as electrodes in photoelectrochemical cells.
