# Heat retaining appliance.

## Abstract
An applicance 10 is provided which is capable of transmitting heat retained therein to cooked food placed in the applicance 10 , so that the food can be kept hot when an electrical cord 37 used for initially causing the applicance 10 to be electrically heated is disconnected therefrom. The appliance 10 includes an outer casing 11 and a removable cover 12 , both of which are made of materials that retard heat loss from the appliance 10 , preferably non metallic materials. It further includes a housing 13 enclosed by the casing 11 and cover 12 and made of a non metallic material, such as plastic, in which a non metallic heat retaining material 30 , such as wax, is confined. Disposed throughout the heat retaining material 30 is a resistance heater 31 , which is removably connected to the electrical cord 37 for melting the material 30 , so that the heat of fusion of the melted material may be transmitted into the food to reduce its cooling rate after the heater 31 is disconnected from the cord 37 .
