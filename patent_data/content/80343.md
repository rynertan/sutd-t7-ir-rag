# Optical bypass switch.

## Abstract
The invention provides an optical bypass switch operated by an electrical signal and which does not employ any moving parts. The switch employs a polarising beam splitter 43 and a 90 twisted nematic crystal layer 48 which rotates the plane of polarisation of an incident beam through 90 in the absence of an electrical signal, and leaves its plane of polarisation unchanged when a signal 55 is applied to the layer. An incident signal from an optic fibre 41 is collimated by a lens 42 and split into mutually polarised beams which are re flected by prisms 46, 47, 51 so as to traverse the nematic crystal layer 48 in opposite directions. The reflecting means direct the beams on to the beam splitter, where they are recom bined. In the absence of an electrical signal, the polarised component 66 initially transmitted by the beam splitter 43 has its polarisation rotated and is subse quently reflected by the beam splitter 43 . On the other hand the component initially reflected also has its polarisation ro tated and is subsequently transmitted by the beam splitter, so that the two components combine to form an unpolarised out put beam directed to the fibre 65 . When the voltage signal is applied to the crystal layer 48 the polarisation of light passing through it unchanged, and the component initially reflected by the beam splitter 43 is again reflected, and that originally transmitted is again transmitted, so that the component beams combine and are a directed to the other output fibre 73 . To reduce crosstalk, a 180 reflecting prism may be em ployed to redirect light wich has pased once through the switch so that it passes again through a second parallel path within the switch.
