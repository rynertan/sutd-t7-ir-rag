The alkyl substituents may be lower alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms.The radicals R1, R2 and V can be different from each other or they are preferably indentical. When radicals R1, R2 and V represent alkyl, they may be straight or branched alkyl groups. Examples of said alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, sec butyl, hexyl, octyl, dodecyl or octadecenyl. Substituted alkyl groupsV, R1 and R2 are in particular haloalkyl, cyanoalkyl, hydroxyalkyl or alkoxyalkyl, each preferably containing 2 to 4 carbon atoms, for example, 2 chloroethyl, 2 cyanoethyl, 2 hydroxyethyl, 3 hydroxypropyl, ss methoxyethyl or ss ethoxypropyl.Examples of cycloalkyl in the meaning of R1, R2 and V are cyclopentyl or preferably, cyclohexyl.In a preferred embodiment, the radicals R1, R2 and V are alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and most preferably methyl or ethyl groups.If the substituents R1 and R2 together with the common nitrogen atom, represent a heterocyclic radical, this is for example, pyrrolidino, piperidino, pipecolino, morpholino, thiomorpholino or piperazino.Possible anions A are both anions of inorganic acids for example, the chloride, bromide, fluoride, iodide, sulphate or phosphate ion and of organic acids, for example of aro matic or aliphatic sulfphonic acids such as the benzene sulphonate, p toluenesulphonate, methanesulfphonate or ethanesulphonate ion, and also the anions or acid alkyl esters of inorganic acids, such as the methosulphate or ethosulphate ions, or carboxylic acids, e.g. acetate, propionate, or benzoate ions.The anion A preferably denotes chloride, bromide, iodide methylsulphate or ethylsulphate ion.Important fluorinated cationic compounds of the formula 1 are those of the formulaEMI4.1 wherein Rf represents a perfluoroalkyl group of 1 to 18 carbon atoms, Q1 is alkylene or 2 or 3 carbon atoms, each ofR3 and R4 independently represents alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, andV1 represents alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or benzyl and,A 3 has the given meaning.Particularly interesting fluorinated cationic compounds are those of the formulaEMI4.2 wherein Rf represents a perfluoroalkyl group of 4 to 14 carbon atoms and each ofV2 and R5 represents methyl or ethyl andA e has the given meaning.Amongst these compounds of the formula 3 , those in whichRf represents perfluorobutyl, perfluorohexyl, perfluoro octal, perfluorodecyl, perfluorododecyl, perfluorotetradecyl or a mixture of these substituents, V2 and R5 represent methyl or ethyl and A represents a chloride ion are particularly preferred.The fluorinated cationic compounds of the formula 1 are manufactured by reacting a mercaptan compound of the formula 4 Rf Q , SH with a compound of the formulaEMI5.1 wherein Rf, Q, R1, R2, V and A 6 have the indicated meaning andY represents halogen such as chlorine, bromine, fluorine or iodine.The reaction is preferably carried out by bringing the reactants to reaction in a mixture of water and a watersoluble co solvent in the presence of a base. The co solvent in the presence of a base. The co solvent is useful to aid the solubilization of the Rf Q thiol in the aqueous phase. The heterogeneous mixture is then stirred while the base is added into the reaction mixture. A mildly exothermic reaction generally occurs and, if the proper solvent system is selected, a homogeneous solution results containing the fluorinated cationic surfactant and the by product halide salt of the base.An example of a starting compound of formula 5 is the commercially available compound, 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl trimethylammonium chloride generally obtained as a 52 by weight aqueous solution .The co solvents for this process are those which are water miscible and in which the Rf Q thiol is partially or completely soluble. The following are examples of such suitable solvents methanol, ethanol, 2 propanol, butyl carbitol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, hexylene glycol, glycol ethers, ethylene glycol monomethyl or monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, tetrahydrofuran, methyl cellosolve acetate, tetramethylene sulfone, acetone, diacetone alcohol, N methyl pyrrolidone and the like. Preferable solvents are water soluble sec and tert alcohols. The most preferable solvent is hexylene glycol. The ratio of the water miscible Rf Q thiol co solvent to water is an important factor in this invention, if a homogeneous liquid composition is to be obtained. If an insufficient amount of the solvent is employed, the resulting composition is a gel. If an excess of the solvent is used, a non homogeneous product results 2 layers .The specific ratio of the Rf Q thiol solvent to water also depends on the solubility of the Rf Q thiol, the solubility of the surfactant end product and the solubility of the by product salt. For example, if hexylene glycol is theco solvent, in a system at 33 solids, the preferable ratio of water to hexylene glycol is from 7.5 1 to 4.5 1.Since it is clear from the above that the specific ratio of the co solvent to water depends on many factors, it is impossible to predict the acceptable ratio limits for every solvent. A routine method to determine the acceptable ratios for various solvents is to carry out a series of trial reactions, at a specific solids content, varying the amounts of water and solvent and observing whether the resulting product is homogeneous, gelled or heterogeneous. In general, if the product is a gel, then the amount of the solvent should be increased and the amount of water decreased. If the product is heterogeneous 2 layers , the solvent should be decreased and the amount of water increased.The base selected for this process should be one that is capable of abstracting the by product hydrogen halide HY and form the resulting halide salt. The base may be either inorganic or organic and result in the formation of soluble or insoluble by product halide salts. The soluble by product salts remain in the final surfactant solution while insoluble salts may be removed by filtration. The base may be added into the reaction mixture neat or in solution.The following is an illustrative list of bases for this reaction a for soluble by product salts potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, triethylamine, pyridine, trimethylamine, lutidine and N methyl diethanolamine b for insoluble by product salts, many basic ion exchange resins may be used such as Amberlite IRA 93 and IRA 94, Stratabed 93, Amberlyst A 27 OH form , Rexyn 203 and Rexyn 201 OH form . These basic ion exchange resins all contain tertiary amine or quaternary ammonium hydroxide functionally.The general reaction process is one that is unique and novel in several respects a It is very facile. b It is basically a one step process. c It is usually quantitative. d It does not use any previously claimed fluorochemical intermediate chlorohydrins, epoxides, or amines and as such, the expensive fluorochemical component i.e.the Rf Q thiol is not subject to the handling and yield losses of intermediate synthesis steps.In a preferred embodiment of the manufacturing process, the Rf Q thiol, 3 halo 2 hydroxypropyl ammonium halide, water and elected co solvent are placed in the reaction vessel and stirred at an appropriate temperature room temperature is the preferred . The system is generally heterogeneous 2 layers at this stage Then an equivalent amount of base is gradually added with stirring. A mild exotherm usually results. The system becomes homogeneous shortly thereafter indicating the completion of the reaction. The system may also be stirred for an additional length of time at an elevated temperature if necessary.With the proper choice of solids content, co solvent type and amount , and base, a clear homogeneous solution results. The resulting product of the formula 1 can be isolated if desired. Registered Trademark A further embodiment for the manufacture of the new compounds of the formula 1 consists in reacting an epoxide compound of the formulaEMI9.1 wherein V1, R1, R2 and A v have given meaning, with the mercaptan of formula 4 , preferably in the presence of a catalyst such as a Lewis acid e.g. BF3 .This reaction is advantageously carried out at a temperature ranging from 400 to 1000C. This second synthesis requires the isolation of the epoxide of the formula 6 , but has the advantage of the possible elimination of the by product in the finished fluorinated cationic compound.The fluorinated quaternary salts of the formula 1 can also be manufactured by reacting an amine of the formulaEMI9.2 wherein Rf, Q, R1 and R2 have the given meanings with any quaternizing agent introducing the substituent V.Examples of suitable quaternizing agents are alkyl halides, dialkylsulphates, alkyl p methylbenzenesulphonates or benzylhalides. The fluorinated cationic compounds of the formulae 1 to 3 are valuable surfactants. They demonstrate the properties of excellent water solubility and dramiatic lowering of the surface tension of aqueous solutions, even at very low concentrations, e.g. 20 dynes cm at 0.1 active substances.The new surfactants are stable and effective in neutral, acidic and alkaline aqueous solutions.The novel surfactants of this invention are useful to improve or impart properties such as wetting, penetration, spreading, leveling, foam stability, flow properties, emulsification, dispersion, and oil and water repellency.
