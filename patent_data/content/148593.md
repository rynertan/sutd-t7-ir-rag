# Segmented optical system for an alarm system.

## Abstract
A plurality of optical elements such as mirrors 1 to 5 are arranged so that each of them directs radiation from a predeter mined direction towards a common focal point 7 . Each optical element defines a respective discrete field of view 8, 9 to a detector at the focal point, adjacent fields of view overlapping 10 so that an object moving from within one field of view 8 towards and adjacent field of view 9 enters an area 10 which is common to the two adjacent fields of view. There is thus a stepwise change in the intensity of radiation reaching the detector from a single source when that single source crosses the boundary of a field of view and yet there is no space between adjacent fields of view from which no radiation can be received by the detector.
