# CLAMP FOR A CONVOLUTED HOSE

## Abstract
A clamp for a spirally convoluted hose takes the form of a one piece, elongate flexible band having interlocking members 20, 22 at its opposite ends for locating in the valley. A bridge section 18 is positioned adjacent at least one of the members, which is offset to either side of the bridge section, so that the operator can visually check correct location of the bridge section on the ridge of the hose when securing the clamp.
