# Plastic optical fiber.

## Abstract
A plastic optical fiber having an enhanced light trans mission and satisfactory mechanicai and chemical properties is composed of a core having a refractive index n₁, a cladding layer having a refractive index n₂, and a protective layer having a refractive index n₃, the refractive indices n₁, n₂, and n₃ satisfy ing the relationships n₁ n₂ 0.01 and n₃ n₂ 0 and the cladding layer being composed of a copolymer of A 20 to 99.95 by weight of at least one comonomer selected from fluoroalkyl acrylates and methacrylates, B 0.05 to 10 by weight of at least one vinyl comon omer having a hydrophilic radical, and C 0 to 79.95 by weight of at least one other vinyl comonomer capable of copolymerizing with the comonomers A and B .
