# MULTI DIRECTIONAL FIELD ANNEALING OF A THIN FILM ELECTROMAGNETIC READ WRITE HEAD

## Abstract
A method of field annealing a thin film electromagnetic read write head formed of magnetic field responsive mate rial having a known Curie temperature. Such a head also includes an electric coil for operatively exciting the head. The method includes the steps of heating the head to a tempera ture less than the Curie temperature, and then cooling the head while applying electric current to the coil sufficient to induce magnetic flux in the head. The foregoing steps, properly applied, align the magnetic field responsive struc ture, such as magnetic domains in a soft magnetic material, in the direction of operative flux flow in the head.
