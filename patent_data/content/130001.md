# Leadless capacitors.

## Abstract
Lead less tantalum capacitors are made using a lead frame 1 formed to provide connection terminals 3, 4 sepa rated by an H shaped aperture 7 and a bent up anode sup port station 5 . A two part mould 13, 13a is used to injection mould plastics around the capacitor bodies prior to detaching the capacitors from the lead frame by severing necks 15, 16, 17, 18 . A second embodiment has flat connection terminals which are bent around the encapsulated body.
