# IMAGE PROCESSING FILTER

## Abstract
A separable two dimensional Finite Impulse Response FIR digital image processing filter with X dimension filter section having a delay buffer series to which digitized image signals or pixels are first input. The buffer inputs and output are tapped and pixels tapped off are processed by preset multiplier factors and input to an adder where the processed pixels are summed. The summed pixels are fed to a line buffer series of a Y dimension filter section, tapped off from the filter inputs and output, and processed by further preset multiplier factors. The processed pixels are input to a second adder and summed to provide filtered output pixels.
