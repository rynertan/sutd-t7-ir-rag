# Pulse generator circuit.

## Abstract
A pulse generator circuit includes first and second capacitors TR⁷, TR⁴ , first and second switches TR⁹, TR⁶ connected in parallel with each other, an inverter circuit rl, TR1 for inverting an input signal, first switch control circuit TR³, TR⁸, r⁵, r⁶ for charging the first capacitor TR⁷ in response to a high level input signal, discharging the first capacitor TR⁷ with a predetermined time constant in response to a low level input signal, and respectively setting the first switch TR⁹ to a conductive or nonconductive state in response to a voltage across the first capacitor TR⁷ whose level is higher or lower than the predetermined voltage level, and second switch control circuit TR³, TR⁵, r², r³ for charging the second capacitor TR⁴ in response to a high level output signal from the inverter circuit r, TR1 , discharging the sec ond capacitor TR⁴ at a predetermined time constant in response to a low level output signal, and respectively setting the second switch TR⁶ to a conductive or nonconductive state in response to a voltage across the second capacitor TR⁴ whose level is higher or lower than a predetermined voltage level.
