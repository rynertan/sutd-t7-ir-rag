# Opto electronic focussing error detection system.

## Abstract
An opto electronic focussing error detection system is described for detecting a deviation between a radiation reflecting surface 2 and a plane of focussing 7 of an objective system in an optical imaging system, which detection system comprises a beam splitting element 8 and a radiation sensitive detection system 7 arranged behind the beam splitting element 8 , which detection system 7 comprises two groups of detectors, of which a first group is associated with a first sub beam and a second group with a second sub beam of two sub beams formed by the beam splitting element 8 . The beam splitting element 8 is a compound wedge comprising two wedge sections 9, 10 having a common base surface and each having an upper surface situated opposite said base surface, which upper surfaces are inclined relative to each other in the plane of the interface between the two wedge sections, the plane of said interface extending substantially perpendicularly to the base surface and to the upper surfaces and containing the optical axis a of the imaging system, and the two groups of detectors are situated on opposite sides of a plane contain ing the optical axis a and extending substantially perpendi cularly to the interface.
