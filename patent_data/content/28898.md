## Description
COATING COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING HYDROXY ESTER,AMINOPLAST AND ACRYLIC POLYOL OLIGOMER ANDTHEIR USE.This invention is concerned with coating compositions containing certain hydroxy esters, amino resin and low molecular weight hydroxyl functional acrylic polymers.The most important amino resins or aminoplasts, as they are frequently called are the ureaand the melamine formaldehyde compounds. The urea resins have been available since 1930 and the melamine resins since 1940. Thermosetting aminoresin aminoplast coating compositions are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patents 3,082,184 3,198,850 3,852,375 and 3,857,817.The amino resins are thermosetting materials that readily form hard, brittle, colourless, chemically resistant films or coatings on baking.Because of their brittleness and poor adhesion when used alone, they require proper plasticization for use in coatings. This is usually accomplished by combining them with short or medium oil alkyds. The amino alkyd blends provide an excellent combination of coating properties in which the adhesion, toughness, gloss, and durability of the alkyd are complemented by the baking speed, hardness, colour retention, and chemical resistance of the amino component. The amino resin is used as the minor component and usually constitutes from 20 to 40 parts by weight of the resin solids on a parts per hundred basis, although it may be as low as 5 to 10 parts by weight in some automobile finishes and as high as 50 parts by weight on a parts per hundred basis, in some low bake furniture finishes. We have now found that certain hydroxy esters are exceptionally and unexpectedly useful as reactive or co curable diluents for thermosetting coatings containing amino resins. The esters may confer enhanced and high application solids and also remarkably improved flexibility on the coatings. The esters are especially useful in upgrading high solids coatings and coating compositions which contain low molecular weight hydroxyl functional acrylic polymers and melamine resins. The low molecular weight polymers require a high hydroxyl content to maintain an adequate functionality per molecule for crosslinking. The high crosslink density, together with the fact that melamine resins ordinarily confer hardness and brittleness, in their own right, usually results in coatings which are of marginally useful toughness. The reactive diluents described herein may overcome this problem.We have found that addition of minor amounts, preferably 5 to 50, parts by weight on a parts per hundred basis, more preferably 10 to 40 parts by weight on a parts per hundred basis, of a certain hydroxy esters, preferably bis ss hydroxy alkyl esters of certain aliphatic dibasic acids to b amino resin and c low molecular weight hydroxy functional acrylic polymer for coating compositions and coatings markedly improves the solids viscosity balance. The cured films or coatings are more flexible and less brittle and often or frequently show improved water resistance. Components b and c comprising the remaining part of the binder inorganic portion are described in more detail hereinafter.According to the invention there is provided a thermosetting amino resin coating composition comprising a at least one hydroxy ester of the formula EMI3.1 n wherein R2 represents a chemical bond or the group which would be formed by the removal of the carboxyl, anhydride or ester groups from an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid, or anhydride or ester thereof, said acid, anhydride or ester having from 2 to 13 carbon atoms R1and R3 represent the same or different groups which would be formed by the removal of the two hydroxyl groups from a diol or the oxirane oxygen atom from an epoxy compound, said diol or epoxy compound having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms, and n is an integer of from 1 to 3 b an aminoplast, and c an acrylic polyol oligomer having a weight average molecular weight of from 400 to 30,000 and a dispersity of from 1.1 to 10.The hydroxy esters useful in the present invention are known materials and may be formed from one or more aliphatic dicarboxylic acids, an anhydride or an alkyl ester thereof, the alkyl group preferably containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and from one or more dihydroxy alcohols diols and or corresponding epoxy compounds. Any suitable aliphatic dicarboxylic acid or derivative may be used for example, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, succinic anhydride, glutaric acid, adipic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, maleic acid, maleic anhydride, fumaric acid, itaconic acid, citraconic acid and the like. It is preferred that use should be made of one or more aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with 2 to 13 carbon atoms, more particularly dicarboxylic acids having 4 to 9 carbon atoms, which acids may or may not be ethylenically unsaturated, for instance, maleic acid and or adipic acid.It is preferred that use should be made of a diol having 2 to 9 carbon atoms. Preferred hydroxy esters are bis B hydroxyalkyl esters.The number average molecular weight of the hydroxy ester is preferably from 192 to 2000, more preferably from 192 to 1000.Any suitable diol and or epoxy compound may be used to prepare the hydroxy ester, for example, ethylene glycol, ethylene oxide, propane 1,2 diol, propane 1,3 diol, propylene oxide, 2,2 dimethyl propane diol, butane l, 2 diol, butane 1,3 diol, butane l, 4 diol, butylene oxide, hexane 1,6 diol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol,dipropylene glycol, 2 ethyl hexane 1,6 diol, 2,2,4 trimethyl pentane l, 3 diol, 2,2 ,4 trimethyl hexane 1,6diol and octane 1,8 diol. It is preferred that a diol having 2 to 9 carbon atoms be used. The esters for use in the invention may be prepared by any suitable manner. For example, one or more diols and or epoxy compounds such as those mentioned above may be reacted with one or more dicarboxylic acids, an anhydride and or an alkyl ester thereof in a molar ratio of the order of 2 1. Alternatively, a dicarboxylic anhydride may be first reacted with a diol in a molar ratio of the order of 1 1, after which the resulting reaction product is reacted with an epoxy compound, preferably in a molar ratio of the order of 1 1. The esterification reaction preferably takes place at an elevated temperature, for instance, at 1150 to 2500C., in the presence, if desired, of one or more organic solvents, such as toluene or xylene. It is preferred that the reaction should be so carried out that the average number of ester groups per molecule of the prepared ester diol is in the range of 2 to 4 i.e. n is 1 to 2 . It will be appreciated that the hydroxy ester reaction product will often be a mixture of compounds.Thus while, in the above formula, n is an integer from 1 to 3 for an individual compound, for a mixture of compounds n is an average number of from 1 to 3. The reaction is generally carried out in the presence of an esterification catalyst in a usual concentration. The catalyst may be any of the known catalysts and may, for instance, be an acid catalyst such as p toluene sulphonic acid, a basic compound such as an amine or compounds such as zinc oxide, tetraisopropyl orthotitanate and triphenyl benzyl phosphonium chloride. Thus preferred hydroxy esters are derived from an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid o anhydride or ester thereof of the formula HOOC R4 COOH wherein R4 is a chemical bond or an alkylene or alkenylene group containing up to 11 carbon atoms. More preferred esters are similarly derived bis ss hydroxy alkyl esters, especially bis B hydroxyethyl adipate and bis k hydroxyethyl azelate.Any commonly available aminoplast may be used as curing agent for components a , the hydroxy ester, and c , the acrylic polyol oligomer hereinafter described and also forms part of the binder. The aminoplast preferably comprisesN methylol groups and or N methylol ether groups containing amino resin obtained by reacting an aldehyde such as formaldehyde, with a compound containing amino groups or amido groups, such as melamine, urea, N,N ethylene urea, dicyandiamide and benzoguanamine. The preparation of such compounds is described in Houben Weyl,Methoden der organischen Chemie, Band 14 2, pp.319 371 1963 . It is more preferred that the afore described compounds should be entirely or partly etherified with alcohols having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, for instance, with methanol, ethanol, npropanol, isopropanol, n butanol, isobutanol, amyl alcohol, hexanol or mixtures of the alcohols referred to above. A preferred amino resin is a methylol melamine containing 4 to 6 methylol groups per molecule of melamine, at least 3 of said methylol groups being etherified with at least one of methanol, ethanol and, preferably, with butanol, or a butanol etherified condensation product of formaldehyde and N,N ethylene diurea.A more preferred amino resin is a hexalkoxymethyl melamine whose alkoxy groups contain 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The aminoplast is preferably used in such an amount that the molar ratio of the hydroxyl groups of the ester diol mixture to the reactive groups of the aminoplast is about from 0.7 to 1.5, preferably from o.8 to 1.3. The aminoplast preferably comprises from 10 to 50 parts by weight of the total organic components binder on a parts per hundred basis, more preferably, from 20 to 40 parts by weight on a parts per hundred basis, of the binder.The third organic component c of the compositions of the invention is a low molecular weight polymeric acrylic polyol oligomer , alternatively termed a hydroxyl functional acrylic oligomer.These acrylic oligomers may be formed by the methods taught in U.S. Patents 4,102,843 4,059,616 and 4,103,093, which are incorporated herein by reference. The acrylic oligomer has a weight average molecular weight Mw of from 400 to 30,000, preferably from 400 to 20,000, more preferably from 1000 to 20,000. The dispersities ratio of weight average molecular weight Mw to number average molecular weight Mn of the acrylic oligomers useful in the present invention are also quite low, generally being from 1.1 to 10, or higher preferably less than 5, and more preferably 1.1 to 3. It will be understood that acrylic in this specification and claims includes materials containing or derived from the methacrylic groupCH2 C CH3 CO as well as, or instead of, materials containing or derived from the acrylic group CH2 CHCO .Any of the materials mentioned in the aforementionedU.S. Patents, 4,103,093 4,102,843, and 4,059,616 may be used in preparing the acrylic polyol oligomers useful in the present invention.It should be noted that the method of initiation for the polymerization of the acrylic polyol oligomers is not critical to the practice of the present invention. Thus, in addition to the anionic polymerizations disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,103,093, and the others mentioned in the paragraph above, the acrylic polyol oligomers useful in the present invention include those prepared by conventional free radical polymerization as well as those prepared by non catalytic types of initiation, such as by conventional thermal and photochemical means.Thus the acrylic polyol oligomer c is a polymer having a weight average molecular weight and dispersity as described above and preferably contains units of at least one hydroxy alkyl acrylate and or methacrylate. The polymer usually contains at least 50 by weight of acrylic and or methacrylic units.Preferably component c comprises at least one of i polymer containing units of methyl methacrylate M butyl methacrylate BMA hydroxyethyl methacrylate HEMA and acrylic acid AA , for example in the respective amounts by weight of 28 35 parts, 30 35 parts, 40 10 parts and 2 5 parts ii polymer containing units of methyl methacrylate butyl methacrylate hydroxyethyl methacrylate and methacrylic acid MAA , for example in the respective amounts by weight of 28 35 parts 30 35 parts 40 10 parts and 2 5 parts A particularly useful oligomer comprises an acrylic polyol of MMAZ BMA HElMA MAA in the proportions, by weight,of 28 30 40 2 having a Mw Mn ratio of 2000 1300 by gel permeation chromatography GPC and a viscosity of 6000 cps. at 80 solids in cellosolve acetate. iii polymer containing units of butyl acrylate BA styrene S hydroxyethyl methacrylate and acrylic acid, for example in the weight proportions 50 27 20 3 respectively Aromatic monomers such as styrene and substituted styrenes may comprise up to 49 of the monomer units in the polymer c , for example by substituting in whole or part for the butyl methacrylate or butyl acrylate when those monomers are used. iv polymer containing units of methyl methacrylate ethyl acrylate EA styrene, hydroxyethyl methacrylate and itaconic acid 1A for example in the respective weight proportions 36.4 14.2 13.2 11 2. v polymer containing units of methyl methacrylate butyl acrylate hydroxypropyl methacrylate HPMA and methacrylic acid for example in the respective weight proportions 35 50 10 5 vi polymer containing units of methyl methacrylate butyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate hydroxypropyl methacrylate and methacrylic acid for example in the respective weight proportions 35 30 27.5 10 2.5. Preferably these, and other, acrylic oligomers in the invention have a weight average molecular weight of from 500 to 2500 and dispersities as described above.Other acrylic polyol oligomers will readily occur to those skilled in the art.The acrylic polyol oligomer preferably comprises from 30 to 80 parts by weight of the binder on a parts per hundred basis, more preferably from 40 to 70 parts by weight on a parts per hundred basis of the total organic components of the coating composition.The coating compositions of the invention may contain the usual auxiliary materials and additives, such as pigments and pigment dispersing agents, thixotropic agents or other means to influence the rheological properties, colorants, solvents and accelerators for the curing reaction, for instance, acid compounds such as paratoluene sulphonic acid or blocked products thereof.The coating composition of the invention may be clear and pigment free or contain, for example, as little as 1 to 2 by weight of pigment in the case of metallic pigments such as aluminium and as much as 70 90 by weight of inorganic pigments, such as ZnO, Ti02 or iron oxide or mixtures thereof, calculated on the total solids content of the coating composition. Suitable pigments include the usual kinds, namely acid, neutral or basic pigments which may be of an organic or inorganic nature. If desired, the pigments may have been pre treated to modify their properties. Suitable pigments include titanium dioxide, iron oxide, carbon black and phthalocyanine pigments. The term pigments is also understood to include metallic pigments such as those of aluminium, zinc and stainless steel.The coating composition ready for use has a viscosity generally not higher than 20 poises, preferably from 0.5 to 10 poises.One embodiment of the invention provides a coating composition comprising from 1 to 90 by weight of pigment and from 10 to 99 by weight of a composition comprising components a , b and c as described herein.Another embodiment of the invention provides a substrate bearing a coating of the coating compositions of the invention described herein in cured form.The coating compositions may be applied to a substrate in any desirable way, for instance, by roller coating, spraying, brushing, sprinkling, flow coating, dipping or electrostatic spraying.Further, the coating compositions may be cured or baked in the usual manner, for instance, at ambient temperature or at the usual elevated temperatures between, for example, 100 and 160 C, with a residence time of 20 to 60 minutes in a baking oven.Some preferred embodiments of the invention will now be more particularly described in and by the following Examples in which all parts and percentages are by weight and all temperatures in degrees Celsius, unless otherwise stated.Examples A,B and C illustrate preparation of hydroxy esters suitable for use in the compositions of the invention.Preparation of bis B hydroxyalkyl esters.Example APreparation of Bis D hydroxyethyl adipate. A three liter 3 neck flask equipped with a stirrer and a Dean Stark trap is charged with 730.7g 5 mols of adipic acid, 775.9g. 12.5 mols of ethylene glycol, 10g. of Amberlyst 15 a strong acid catalytic ion exchange resin fromRohm and Haas Co. and 200g. of benzene. The solution is heated to reflux, and the water evolved is collected in the Dean Stark trap.After 16 hours at reflux, the Amberlyst 15 is removed by filtration, and the benzene and excess ethylene glycol is removed by distillation at reduced pressure final conditions of pot temperature 105 C. and 1 mm of vacuum . The product bis sshydroxyethyl adipate remaining contained 5.4 ethylene glycol and had an acid titre Of 0.26 meq. g.Example B Preparation of Bis ss hydroxyethyl Azelate. The procedure used in Example A is followed but using 941.2g. 5 mols of azelaic acid and 775.9g. 12.5 mols of ethylene glycol. After stripping the benzene and excess ethylene glycol as outlined above in Example A, the residual bis B hydroxyethyl acelate contained only 3.3 ethylene glycol and has an acid titre of 0.39 meq. g.Example CThe bis B hydroxyalkyl esters may also be prepared by the method disclosed in J.Am.Chem.Society, Viol.57, pgs 115, 116, Jan. 1935 in an article entitled Glycol Esters of Dibasic Acids. The di ss hydroxy ethyl Esters. As described therein, the este ification of succinic, glutaric, adipic and sebacic acids with excess glycol at 100 0C results in the formation of the corresponding di ss hydroxyethyl esters or bis 8 hydroxyethyl esters as they are more preferably termed. The general method of preparation of the bis ss hydroxyethyl ester is to esterify 0.05 gram mole of the dibasic acid with 0.5 gram mole of glycol at 1000C to 1150C. The excess glycol is then removed under reduced pressure by heating the mixture in an oil bath at 130 1400C for a period of one to two hours. No esterification catalyst is required as the reaction proceeds readily at the esterification temperatures abovenoted however, a common esterification catalyst may optionally be used if desired such as p toluene sulphonic acid, an amine or compounds such as zinc oxide . In the manner described above and using a the dibasic acid adipic acid and excess glycol in the proportions and at the esterification temperature above noted, the bis D hydroxyethyl ester of adipic acid is prepared and b using azelaic acid and excess glycol in the proportions and at the esterification temperatures above noted, the bis D hydroxyethyl ester of azelaic acid is prepared.
