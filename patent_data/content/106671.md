# Prefetching instructions in computer.

## Abstract
Prefetching instructions for a pipelined CPU. A TIP transfer and indirect prediction table 42 predicting the target address of transfer and indirect instructions based on past history of the execution of those instructions. The prefetch mechanism forms instruction addresses and fetches instructions in parallel with the execution of previously fetched instructions by a central execution pipeline unit CEPU 12 of the CPU. As instructions are prefetched, the TIP table is checked to determine the past history of those instructions. If no transfers or indirects are found, the prefetch proceeds sequentially. If transfer or indirect instruc tions are found, then the prefetch uses information in the TIP table to begin fetching the target instruction s . The target addresses are predicted so that in the usual case instructions following a transfer can be executed at a rate of 1 instruction per pipeline cycle regardless of the pipeline depth or the frequency of transfers. Instructions are fetched 2 words at a time, so that the instruction fetch unit IFU 10 can stay ahead of the CEPU. An instruction stack 20 buffers double words of instruc tions fetched by the IFU while waiting for execution by the CEPU. The TIP table is updated based upon the actual execution of instructions by the CEPU, and the correctness of the TIP table predictions is checked during execution of every instruction.
