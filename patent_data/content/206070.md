## Description
The invention relates generally to the field of photography. More particalarly, the invention relates to a camera for taking an exposure for use in producing a pseudo telephoto print from a portion of the exposure, wherein an image of the subject which will appear in the print can be seen in the viewfinder of the camera. In the art of photography there are known methods of making a print that is made from a central portion of an exposure having the same width to length ratio, e.g., 3 1 2 5, as that of the whole exposure. During the printing process the negative is masked at its upper, lower, left and right marginal zones, leaving the central portion of the negative unobscured. Alternatively, the film gate in the enlarger may be correspondingly masked or adjusted. Then, an enlargement is made of the central portion of the negative to provide a print with the same width to length ratio as that of the central portion. Thus the print will have a telephoto of close up format, and can be called a pseudo telephoto print . U.S. Patent No. 3,490,844 discloses a method of making a print of a selected portion of a subject to be photographed. The method comprises the following steps viewing the subject in the viewfinder of a camera manually adjusting mechanical masking members visible in the viewfinder to frame a selected portion of the subject exposing the film in the camera to obtain a latent image of the subject encoding the exposure on the film with indicia representative of the selected portion of the subject processing the film to obtain a negative of the latent image of the subject and sensing the indicia to make a print of the selected portion of the subject from the negative. When the selected portion of the subject has the same relative position in the viewfinder as a corresponding portion of the exposure, enlargement of the portion in the negative will provide a pseudo telephoto effect similar to the actual telephoto effect provided by a telephoto lens. Thus a pseudo telephoto print can be made during the printing process from an exposure taken without a telephoto lens. Although U.S. Patent No. 3,490,844 discloses a method of making a pseudo telephoto print from an exposure taken without a telephoto lens, the exposure is made using an objective lens having a single or fixed focal length, probably around 45mm. A 45mm lens is a normal lens, as distinguished from a telephoto lens, and is chosen to enable normal prints as well as pseudo telephoto prints to be obtained. As a result, however, the pseudo telephoto print obtained cannot have much of a telephoto effect. This is because the selected portion of the negative cannot be enlarged significantly from an exposure taken with a normal lens before the sharpness of the image is lost. In U.S. Patent No. 3,490,844, the mechanical masking numbers visible in the viewfinder are adjustable to provide different size masking configurations in the finder field for framing a selected portion of a subject to be photographed. The respective size masking configurations correspond to the various pseudo telephoto effects to be attained. The particular pseudo telephoto effect associated with the selected setting of the masking members is viewed in the framed, central portion of the finder field. As a result, the image of the subject which is to appear in the pseudo telephoto print can only be seen in a small portion of the finder field. This may make it difficult to see the details of the subject in the finder field. It is an object of the invention to provide a pseudo telephoto camera for taking exposures from which superior pseudo telephoto prints can be produced, specifically without the loss of image sharpness in the print and without the loss of subject detail in the finder field as in the prior art camera disclosed in the U.S. Patent No. 3,490,844. The object of the invention is achieved by providing a photographic camera as claimed in claim 1. By including a finder lens assembly in the viewfinder which is adjustable to change its angular field of view to an actual telephoto field that is proportional to a pseudo telephoto format, the pseudo telephoto format can be viewed in the full field of the viewfinder, rather than in a smaller portion of the finder field as in the prior art camera disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,490,844. This makes it possible for the viewfinder to show a full natural size image of the subject which is to appear in the pseudo telephoto print. Moreover, by employing an objective lens assembly having a telephoto field of view in addition to its normal field of view, a greater range of pseudo telephoto effects can be obtained before image sharpness is lost, as compared to the prior art camera disclosed in the 844 patent. One way of carrying out the invention is described in detail below with reference to drawings which illustrate a specific embodiment, in which The invention is described as being embodied preferably in a 35mm still picture camera. Because such a camera is well known, this description is directed in particular to photographic elements forming part of or cooperating directly with the invention. It is to be understood, however, that other elements not specifically shown or described may take various forms known to persons of ordinary skill in the art. Referring now to the drawings, and in particular to FIG. 1, there is shown a composite of certain details of a still picture camera for use with 35mm film, such as the various color print films manufactured by Eastman Kodak Company. The camera includes an objective lens 1 for focusing an image of a subject being photographed on a frame section F of the film. Conventional means, such as a pressure plate and a pair of rails, not shown, support the frame section F in the focal plane of the objective lens to take the exposure. A direct view eye level optical viewfinder 3 in the camera includes a finder lens 5 and a Porro prism assembly 7 for viewing an erect image of the subject being photographed. Respective manually operated means 9 and 11 are disposed about the objective lens 1 and the finder lens 5 for adjusting the two lenses before taking the exposure. The objective lens 1 in the camera is a known type of zoom lens, that is, a lens of variable focal length which can be adjusted continuously by movement of separate groups of elements in the lens to change the focal length of the lens. This is done in order to vary the angular field of view coverage of the objective lens 1 between a wide angle limit and a telephoto limit. Alternatively, a lens assembly may be provided having a plurality of interchangable elements for changing the focal length. As shown in FIG. 1, the objective lens 1 includes a front element section 13 which moves in a double action path along the optical axis 0 1, first back rearward and then forward as the focal length of the lens is changed from a wide angle limit of, for example, 35mm, to a moderate telephoto limit of, for example, 80mm. Conversely, a rear element section 15 of the objective lens 1 moves forward along the optical axis O 1 in an almost smooth, linear path as the focal length of the lens is adjusted from 35mm to 80mm. At the shortest focal length of the objective lens 1, i.e., the wide angle limit 35mm, the front and rear sections 13 and 15 of the lens are farthest apart and the angular field of view is approximately 63 The manually operated means 9 for moving the front and rear sections 13 and 15 of the objective lens 1 to adjust the lens to a selected focal length from 35mm to 80mm is shown in FIGS. 1, 3 and 4. FIG. 1 shows the manually operated means 9 in a rolled out flat elevational form. FIG. 3 shows such means 9 in an exploded perspective form. FIG. 4 shows the means 9 in a sectional form. As seen in FIG. 4, a cylindrical barrel 17 fixed to the camera body, not shown, supports the front and rear sections 13 and 15 of the objective lens 1 for movement along the optical axis 0 1. The fixed barrel 17 has a semi annular opening 19 which is bridged in light trapping relation by an exterior zoom ring 21 and an interior cam ring 23. The zoom ring 21 has a knurled outer surface 25 and is secured at an inner surface 27 to the cam ring 23. The respective rings 21 and 23 are supported on exterior and interior surfaces of the barrel 17 for rotation relative to the barrel, about the front and rear sections 13 and 15 of the objective lens 1. The front and rear sections 13 and 15 have respective cam followers 29 and 31 which project into different shaped cam slots 33 and 35 in the cam ring 23, to adjust the objective lens 1 from its 35mm focal length to its 80mm focal length. The different shape of the cam slots 33 and 35, and respective settings of the cam ring 23 for adjusting the objective lens 1 to the 35mm focal length and the 80mm focal length, are depicted in FIG. 1. When, as viewed in FIGS. 1 and 3, the cam ring 23 is rotated in a clockwise direction C by turning the zoom ring 21 in the same direction from the 35mm setting to the 80mm setting of the cam ring, the front section 13 of the objective lens 1 first moves rearward and then moves forward because of a curved segment 37 of the cam slot 33. Simultaneously, the rear section 15 of the objective lens 1 simply moves forward because of a straight, inclined segment 39 of the cam slot 35. This movement of the front and rear sections 13 and 15 adusts the objective lens 1 to continuously change its focal length from 35mm to 80mm. A pointer 41 is provided on the zoom ring 21 for alignment with respective indications of the 35mm and 80mm settings of the cam ring 23. As shown in FIG. 3, the indications are embossed on the outside of the cylindrical barrel 17. As is apparent from FIG. 1, the cam ring 23 can be rotated in the clockwise direction C beyond its 80mm setting by similarly turning the zoom ring 21 to a plurality of pseudo telephoto settings 120mm, 160mm and 200mm, without moving the objective lens 1 from its longest telephoto focal length 80mm. This is possible because of respective, non inclined, identical dwell segments 43 in the two cam slots 33 and 35. Conversely, the cam ring 23 can be rotated in a counter clockwise direction beyond its 35mm setting by similarly turning the zoom ring 21 to a pseudo panoramic setting, without moving the objective lens 1 from its shortest wide angle focal length 35mm. This is possible because of respective, non inclined, identical dwell segments 45 in the two cam slots 33 and 35. Indications of the pseudo telephoto settings 120 mm, 160mm and 200mm of the cam ring 23 and the pseudo panoramic setting of the cam ring are embossed on the outside of the cylindrical barrel 17, beyond the 80mm and 35mm indications on the barrel, for alignment with the pointer 41 on the zoom ring 21. Like the objective lens 1, the finder lens 5 is a known type of zoom lens which can be adjusted continuously by movement of separate groups of elements to change its focal length. This is done in order to vary the angular field of view coverage of the finder lens 5 between a wide angle limit and a telephoto limit. Alternatively, a lens assembly may be provided having a plurality of interchangeable elements for changing the focal length. As shown in FIG. 1, the finder lens 5 includes a front element section 47 which moves in a double action path along the optical axis O 2, first back rearward and then forward as the focal length of the lens is changed from a wide angle limit of, for example, 35mm, to a telephoto limit of, for example, 200mm. Conversely, a rear element section 49 of the finder lens 5 moves forward along the optical axis O 2 in an almost smooth, linear path as the focal length of the lens is adjusted from 35mm to 200mm. At the shortest focal length of the finder lens 5, i.e., the wide angle limit 35mm, the front and rear sections 47 and 49 of the lens are farthest apart and the angular field of view is approximately 63 The manually operated means 11 for moving the front and rear sections 47 and 49 of the finder lens 5 to adjust the lens to a selected focal length from 35mm to 200mm is shown in FIGS. 1, 3 and 4. As seen in FIG. 4, a cylindrical barrel 51 fixed to the camera body supports the front and rear sections 47 and 49 of the finder lens 5 for movement along the optical axis 0 2. The fixed barrel 51 has an internal, annular cut out 53 in which is located a cam ring 55. The cam ring 55 is supported in the cut out 53 for rotation relative to the barrel 51, about the front and rear sections 47 and 49 of the finder lens 5. The front and rear sections 47 and 49 have respective cam followers 57 and 59 which project into different shaped cam slots 61 and 63 in the cam ring 55, to adjust the finder lens 5 from its 35mm focal length to its 200mm focal length. The different shape of the cam slots 61 and 63, and respective settings of the cam ring 55 for adjusting the finder lens 5 to the 35mm and 200mm focal lengths, as well as to several intermediate focal lengths 80mm, 120mm and 160mm, are depicted in FIG. 1. When, as viewed in FIGS. 1 and 3, the cam ring 55 is rotated in the clockwise direction C from the 35mm setting to the 200mm setting of the cam ring, the front section 47 of the finder lens 5 first moves rearward and then moves forward because of a curved segment 65 of the cam slot 61. Simultaneously, the rear section 49 of the finder lens 5 simply moves forward because of a straight, inclined segment 67 of the cam slot 63. This movement of the front and rear sections 47 and 49 adjusts the finder lens 5 to continuously change its focal length from 35mm to 200mm. As is apparent from FIG. 1, the cam ring 55 can be rotated in a counter clockwise direction opposite to the direction C beyond its 35mm setting to a pseudo panoramic setting, without moving the finder lens 5 from its shortest wide angle focal length 35mm. This is possible because of respective non inclined, identical dwell segments 69 in the two cam slots 61 and 63. A gear 71 couples the manually operated means 9 for adjusting the objective lens 1 to a selected focal length and the manually operated means 11 for adjusting the finder lens 5 to a selected focal length, in a manner such that rotation of the zoom ring 21 to rotate the cam ring 23 for the objective lens will cause the cam ring 55 for the finder lens to be similarly rotated. As shown in FIG. 1, 3 and 4, the gear 71 engages an arcuate array of teeth 73 on the zoom ring 21 and a like array of teeth 75 on the cam ring 55. When the zoom ring 21 is rotated in the clockwise direction C to move its pointer 41 from alignment with the 35mm indication on the fixed barrel 17 to alignment with the 80mm indication on the barrel, the objective lens 1 and the finder lens 5 are adjusted continuously from 35mm focal lengths to 80mm focal lengths and the cam rings 23 and 55 are adjusted to similar settings, shown in FIG. 1. When the zoom ring 21 is rotated in the clockwise direction C to move its pointer 41 from alignment with the 80mm indication on the barrel 17 to successive alignment with the 120mm , 160mm and 200mm indications on the barrel, the finder lens 5 is adjusted continuously from the 80mm focal length to a 200mm focal length and the cam rings 23 and 55 are adjusted to similar settings. However, the objective lens 5 remains stationary at its 80mm focal length. When the zoom ring 21 is rotated in a counter clockwise direction to move its pointer 41 from alignment with the 35mm indication on the barrel 17 to alignment with the PAN indication on the barrel, the cam rings 23 and 55 ace adjusted to similar settings. However, the objective lens 1 and the finder lens 5 remain stationary at their 35mm focal lengths. The Porro prism assembly 7 in the viewfinder 3 permits an erect image of the subject being photographed to be viewed through the finder lens 5. A single Porro prism would erect the image, but would leave it reversed left to right. To correct for this, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, there is provided two Porro prisms 77 and 79 which are placed hypotenuse to hypotenuse and at right angles to each other. FIG. 2 illustrates the optical path 0 2 through the two Porro prisms 77 and 79 to an eyelens 81. In essence, the two reflecting surfaces 83 and 85 of the prism 77 and the two reflecting surfaces 87 and 89 of the prism 79 cooperate to turn the image focused by the finder lens 5 upright as well as right way round. A liquid crystal display LCD masking unit 91 is located between the respective opposite halves of hypotenuse surfaces 93 and 95 of the two Porro prisms 77 and 79. The LCD masking unit is a variation of a known type of unit, such as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,478,493, granted October 23, 1984, and is depicted in FIG. 5B in a masking configuration in the finder field 97 of the viewfinder 3. The masking configuration corresponds to the panoramic setting of the cam ring 23 for the objective lens 1 and the similar setting of the cam ring 55 for the finder lens 5. As shown in FIG. 5B, the masking unit 91 comprises four sets of right angle insulated strips 99 of transparent, electrically conductive material arranged in side by side relation in the respective corner zones of the finder field 97 and two sets of elongate insulated strips 101 of the same material arranged in side by side relation in the upper and lower marginal zones of the finder field. Preferably, each set of the right angle strips 99 includes three strips, and each set of the elongate strips 101 includes three strips. FIG. 5A illustrates the finder field 97 as it appears with the masking unit 91 de energized, which is the situation when the cam rings 23 and 55 are rotated from their 35mm settings to their 200mm settings or vice versa. In this instance, the right angle strips 99 and the elongate strips 101 are not visible in the finder field 97. FIG. 5B illustrates the finder field 97 as it appears with the masking unit 91 energized to provide a pseudo panoramic format, which is the situation when the cam rings 27 and 55 are in their panoramic settings. In this instance, the elongate strips 101 in the upper and lower marginal zones and the right angle strips 99 in the corner zones are opaque in the finder field 97. In contrast to the electrically controlled LCD masking unit 91, a mechanically controlled masking unit may be provided in the viewfinder 3. An example of a mechanical unit is shown in U.S. Patent No. 3,212,422, granted October 19, 1965. Four light emitting diodes LED s 103, 105, 107 and 109 are disposed in evenly spaced relation in the camera for selective energization to spot expose various code fiducials in binary form on the film adjacent the frame section F, as shown in FIG. 3. Selective energization of the LED s 103, 105, 107 and 109 is controlled by individually closing respective switches SW1, SW2, SW3 and SW4. The closing of the switches SW1, SW2, SW3 or SW4 may be effected by a single closure member, not shown, on the cam ring 23, for example, as the cam ring is positioned selectively in its pseudo settings, i.e., pan, 120mm, 160mm and 200mm. The binary form of the resulting code fiducial on the frame section F indicates the particular pseudo setting of the cam ring 23. When the cam ring 23 is in its pseudo panoramic setting, the switch SW1 is closed and the LED 103 is energized. Thus the binary form of the code fiducial is 1000. When the cam ring is in its 120mm, 160mm or 200mm pseudo telephoto settings, the switches SW2, SW3 or SW4 are closed and the LED s 105, 107 or 109 are energized. Thus the binary form of the code fiducial is 0100, 0010 or 0001. When the cam ring 23 is rotated from its 35mm setting to its 80mm setting or vice versa, the switches SW1 SW4 are open and none of the LED s are energized. Thus the binary form of the code fiducial is in effect 0000. Although not shown, it may be desirable for the LED 103 to be energized each time the cam ring 23 is in a pseudo panoramic or pseudo telephoto setting. In this instance, the LED 103 would provide a reference or pseudo indicator fiducial for use in the printing process and the LED s 105, 107 and 109 would provide the code fiducials. Thus, the various codings might be 1000, 1100, 1110 and 1111, for example. FIG. 6 depicts known controller means 111, that is, a logic circuit, for operating the LCD masking unit 91 and selectively energizing the LED s 103, 105, 107 or 109 in response to closing of the switches SW1, SW2, SW3 or SW4. An ASA film speed setting device 113 is connected to the controller 111 to limit the intensity of an energized LED in accordance with the film speed of the 35mm film loaded in the camera. A shutter switch 115 is connected to the controller 111 to delay energization of an LED, even though one of the switches SW1 SW4 is closed, until a focal plane shutter, not shown, is opened to permit an exposure. When the focal plane shutter is opened, the shutter switch 115 is closed to energize an LED. Conversely, closing of the focal plane shutter causes the shutter switch 115 to re open, thereby de energizing the LED. Instead of including the direct view viewfinder 3 in the camera, a single lens reflex finder may be used with the invention. In this instance, the image of a subject to be photographed would be viewed in the finder, but through the objective lens. Referring now to FIG. 7, there is shown a chart for understanding how the camera is used to make exposures from which pseudo panoramic and pseudo telephoto prints as well as actual wide angle to actual telephoto prints can be produced. For the most part, the chart is self explanatory. For example, when the cam rings 23 and 55 are in their panoramic settings, the actual focal lengths of the objective lens 1 and the finder lens 5 are the wide angle limit 35mm. The finder field 97 is masked as indicated and the code fiducial 1000 is exposed adjacent the frame section F in response to the closing of the switch SW1. During the printing operation, sensing of the code fiducial 1000 causes the negative to be masked along its upper and lower marginal zones in conformity with the masking of the finder field 97 as indicated. An enlargement is made of the narrowed, non masked portion of the negative, i.e., 16.4 x 32.8mm, to provide a pseudo panoramic 88.9 x 177.8 mm 3 1 2 x 7ins. print similar to one obtained from an exposure made with a panoramic rather than a 35mm objective lens. When the cam rings 23 and 55 are in their 200mm telephoto settings, the actual focal length of the objective lens 1 is its telephoto limit 80mm, but the actual focal length of the finder lens 5 is 200mm. Thus the finder field 97 is not masked, and the code fiducial 0001 is exposed adjacent the frame section F in response to the closing of the switch SW4. During the printing operation, sensing of the code fiducial 0001 causes the negative to be masked along its upper, lower, left and right marginal zones as indicated. An enlargement is made of the central, non masked portion of the negative, i.e., 9.2 x 13.1mm, to provide a pseudo telephoto 88.9 x 127 mm 3 1 2 x 5ins. print similar to one obtained from an exposure made with a 200mm rather than a 80mm objective lens. When the cam rings 23 and 25 are in their 120mm telephoto settings, the actual focal length of the objective lens 1 is its telephoto limit 80mm, but the actual focal length of the finder lens 5 is 120mm. Thus the finder field 97 is not masked, and the code fiducial 0100 is exposed adjacent the frame section F in response to the closing of the switch SW2. During the printing operation, sensing of the code fiducial 0100 causes the negative to be masked along its upper, lower, left and right marginal zones as indicated. An enlargement is made of the central, unmasked portion of the negative, i.e., 16.4 x 23.4mm, to provide a pseudo telephoto 88.9 x 127 mm 3 1 2 x 5ins. print similar to one obtained from an exposure made with a 120mm rather than a 80mm objective lens. When the cam rings 23 and 25 are rotated from their 35mm settings to their 80mm settings or vice versa, the focal length of the objective lens 1 and the finder lens 5 are continuously changed between 35mm and 80mm. The finder field is not masked and no code fiducial 0000 is exposed adjacent the frame section F, since each of the switches SW1 SW4 is open. Thus an enlargement is made of a substantial portion of the negative, i.e., 23 x 32.8mm.
