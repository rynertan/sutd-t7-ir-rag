# Detection of articles in adjacent passageways.

## Abstract
An article theft detection system for identifying which of two adjacent passageways a protected article 18 passes. Each passageway is provided with spaced apart interrogation and transmitter antennas 10, 12 , but a single receiver antenna 14 services both passageways. Multiplexing is used to energize the interrogation antennas 10, 12 in alternate sequence. The single receiver antenna 14 is connected to a single receiver 34 whose output is connected through switches 38,40 , synchronized with the interrogation multi plexing, to separate alarms for each passageway.
