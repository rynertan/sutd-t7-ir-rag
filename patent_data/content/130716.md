# SIGNAL PROCESSING INTEGRATED CIRCUIT WITH AD OR DA CONVERTER

## Abstract
In an IC used for a PCM communication system, for example, a CODEC circuit, the signal level in the circuit is required to be kept exactly to a specific value. In such a circuit, it is very difficult to keep a specific gain of the circuit because of the effects of filters and parasitic capacitances or parasitic resis tances of the circuit, and so forth. The present invention provides a trimming circuit for the reference voltage of an AD or DA converter, by which the conversion gain of the AD or DA converter, and hence the gain of the CODEC circuit, can be trimmed in steps by blowing built in fuses. The present invention also provides a switched resistor circuit, by which the conversion gain can be switched, allowing processing of signals conforming to different conversion laws.
