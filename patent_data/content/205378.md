## Description
The present invention relates to a method and device for timing a pull in of receiving equipment. For example, a receiver of a modulator demodulator MODEM contains a timing pull in device which is operative to pull in an internal clock of the receiving equipment to a timing signal contained in the received signal. The timing pull in operation is performed in such a manner that the internal clock is synchronized in both phase and frequency with the timing signal. More particularly, the present invention concerns an improved timing pull in device able to complete the pull in operation in a very short time. In recent years, it has been common practice to use existing telephone lines for data transmission. Existing telephone lines are usually analog lines in form. Therefore, it is necessary to employ a MODEM which modulates digital data signals into corresponding analog data signals and demodulates the latter signals into the former. The problem is that the transmission characteristics of the telephone lines to which the MODEM is connected are, in general, not the same, and accordingly, a pull in operation is essential for each MODEM. A pull in operation is usually achieved by, first, sending a so called training signal from a transmitter side to the receiver side every time data transmission is to be started. The internal clock of the MODEM is then synchronized with the timing signal contained in the training signal. After the pull in operation, the MODEM can start inherent data processing correctly in response to the successive received data signal. During this pull in operation, sometimes other pull in operations are performed in parallel, such as equalization of an automatic equalizer EQL , automatic again control AGC , and carrier automatic phase control CAPC . Through the synchronous pull in operations, as mentioned previously, the internal clock of the MODEM is synchronized in phase and frequency with the timing signal, i.e., baud rate clock, contained in the received signal at the MODEM. During the reception of the training signal, the pull in operation regarding the phase is especially important. In a prior art technique for a timing pull in operation regarding the phase, a jump in the phase is executed. Namely, the difference in phase between the internal clock and the timing signal is cancelled by the jump in the phase of the internal clock. The problem in the prior art pull in technique is that an undesired transient response is produced for a short period immediately after the execution of the jump in phase. The thus produced transient response is inconvenient in that it becomes difficult to increase the data transmission efficiency by shortening the timing signal duration. In practice, such shortening is not possible due to the presence of the undesired transient response within the duration of the training signal, and therefore, that duration is necessarily extended for a period equal to that of the transient response. Then, where the duration of the training signal is required to be shorter than a prescribed value currently used, it is possible that the synchronous pull in operation cannot be completed within the duration of the training signal due to the presence of the transient response. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a synchronous pull in process and circuit which can overcome the aforesaid problem, i.e., can substantially eliminate the transient response in the synchronous pull in operation. According to a fundamental aspect of the present invention, there is provided a timing pull in device of a receiving equipment comprising means for sampling a received signal from a transmission line by performing a certain sampling timing and demodulation of a received signal means for extracting a timing signal from the demodulated signal means for phase rotating the the extracted timing signal by a predetermined amount of phase rotation means for adjusting the sampling timing of the received signal by carrying out a phase locked loop control on the basis of the phase rotated timing signal means for recovering an impulse from the demodulated signal a first equalizing means for fix equalization of the demodulated signal by using a predetermined tap coefficient and a second equalizing means for carrying out an automatic equalization of the equalized output of the first equalizing means to obtain an output signal wherein said device is adapted to receive a training signal from the transmitting line, said signal containing an impulse component, and further comprising complex conjugate calculating means that cooperate with said impulse recovering means so as to produce a complex conjugate of the clock impulse recovered from the training signal, for transmission to the first equalizing means as a tap coefficient for the fix equalization, calculating means for determining, from the recovered impulse, the tap coefficient for automatic equalization to initialize the second equalizing means, and setting means for setting the amount of phase rotation of the phase rotating means so that the phase of the timing signal extracted by the extracting means coincides with the phase of an internal clock of the equipment. According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a timing pull in device of the receiving equipment comprising means for sampling a received signal from a transmission line by a certain sampling timing and demodulation of a received signal a first equalizing means for fix equalization of the demodulated signal by using a predetermined tap coefficient a second equalizing means for carrying out an automatic equalization of the equalized output of the first equalizing means to obtain an output signal means for extracting a timing signal from the equalized output of the first equalizing means and means for adjusting the sampling timing of the received signal by carrying out a phase locked loop control on the basis of the extracted timing signal characterized in that said device is adapted to receive a training signal, from the transmitting line, said signal containing an impulse component, and further comprising The invention also comprises a method for timing pull in for an initial training of a receiving equipment as set out in claims 9, 11, 12, 13 and sub claim 14. The above object and features of the present invention will be more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Before describing the embodiments of the present invention, the prior art and the problems therein will be first described with reference to the related figures. Figure 1 shows a multi point communication system constituted by a central station CS and end stations ES1 to ES Figure 2 shows polling signals from the central station CS and transmitting signals from each end station ES1 to ES On the other hand, the MODEM of the central station CS must be trained everytime a data signal is received from each of the end stations ES1 to ES That is, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, in the upstream line, when the end station receives the polling signal, if there is data to be sent, the data terminal equipment DTE of the end station sends an RS Request to Send signal to the MODEM thereof. In response to this RS signal, the MODEM of the end station transmits the training signal TR, shown in more detail in Fig. 25, to the MODEM of the central station CS through the upstream line to train the latter MODEM. Then the MODEM of the end station sends a CS Clear to Send signal to the DTE thereof at the appropriate time, when the training of the MODEM of the central station CS is finished, to enable transmission of the response and data. The period from the RS time t₁ to the CS time t₃ is referred as the RC CS time, and this indicates the time length of the training signal TR. The length of the RS CS time depends on the duration of time necessary for the training of the MODEM of the central station CS. If this RS CS time is long in comparison with the duration of time of the user data UD, the transmission efficiency is lowered. Figure 5 is a block diagram of a receiving equipment having a prior art timing pull in circuit as disclosed in EP A 173569, published on 5.3.86. In Fig. 5, a received signal S In the digital signal processor DSP, the output from the A D converter 2 is demodulated by a demodulator DEM 3 and an output thereof is input to a roll off filter ROF 5 as a low pass filter having a roll off characteristic, to shape the waveform of the baseband signal. The output from the roll off filter 5 is subjected to automatic gain control by an automatic gain controller AGC 8 and then given to a timing extraction unit TIM 4 from which a timing signal is extracted from the AGC ed signal. The thus extracted timing signal is applied to a decision unit DCS 10, which decides whether the internal clock is leading or lagging in phase with respect to the thus extracted timing signal. It should be understood that the members 3, 4, 5, 8 and 10 of Fig. 5 are preferably set up as a digital signal processor DSP. When so set up, the DSP executes various processes as schematically illustrated by blocks 3, 4, 5, 8 and 10. The above mentioned decision unit 10 produces a decision output indicating lead or lag in the phase. The lead lag decision output is input to a microprocessor MPU. The microprocessor MPU executes a process, among a variety of processes, equivalent to a phase locked loop, as schematically illustrated by a phase locked loop PLL 7 in Fig. 5. The output of the PLL 7 is adjusted in accordance with the lead lag decision output, so that the output, i.e., the baud rate clock, of the PLL 7 is controlled to synchronize the baud rate clock in phase with the timing signal contained in the received signal S Figures 6A, 6B, and 6C depict waveforms of three signals TM, BC, and BC appearing in Fig. 5. The waveform of Fig. 6A corresponds to the timing signal TM in the form of, for example, a sine wave. The waveform of Fig. 6B corresponds to the aforesaid baud rate clock BC. Each rising edge of baud rate clock BC must be finally synchronized with each rising point Pr of the timing signal TM. The baud rate clock BC is jumped in phase by ϑ, as shown in Fig. 6C, which depicts the thus jumped baud rate clock BC . That is, the phase of the initial clock BC is lagged by ϑ to obtain the clock BC . The lag by ϑ is performed by a phase jump by the PLL 7, which is controlled by the aforesaid lead lag output from the decision unit 10. It should be noted that it is also possible to obtain the shifted clock BC through a lead in phase of the clock BC with respect to the phase of the timing signal TM. Thus, synchronous pull in of the baud rate clock BC relative to the timing signal TM is performed. The aforesaid sampling clock for the A D converter 2 is generated from the baud rate clock BC in such a manner that the frequency of the sampling clock is n times the frequency of the clock BC. The number n is, for example, 4 Thus, the A D converter 2 can sample the received signal to produce the corresponding digital signal in synchronization with the timing signal which is contained in this received signal. For this, the decision unit 10 operates to analyze the output from the timing extraction unit 4. In accordance with the thus detected phase, the decision unit 10 supplies, to the PLL 7, a command for executing the jump in the phase by ϑ for the baud rate clock BC. Thereby, the sampling clock for the A D converter 2 is synchronized in phase with the timing signal TM contained in the received signal. It should be noted that the phase jump is performed only in the duration of the training signal. During usual data transmission after the training signal duration, the PLL 7 operates to carry out a fine adjustment of the frequency in response to the lead lag decision output given from the decision unit 10. As mentioned above, according to the prior art technique, an instantaneous synchronous pull in operation is achieved by a phase jump performed by the PLL 7. Accordingly, the sampling clock to be applied to the A D converter 2, also is instantaneously changed in phase. The sudden change in phase necessarily creates an undesired transient response in the roll off filter 5. Figure 7A, 7B, and 7C depict waveforms of the signals S Therefore, it is impossible to attain a highly efficient data transmission through shortening the training signal duration. To be specific, when it is required to shorten the term of the synchronous pull in operation in the receiver unit, the existence of the response TRES acts as an impediment. The term of the synchronous pull in operation is generally defined by the RS CS time corresponding to the aforesaid training signal duration. Thus, the transient response TRES cannot be disregarded for the MODEM training. Thus, in the worst case, the receiver unit may fail in the synchronous pull in operation. This can easily happen in a data transmission system set up with very poor quality transmission lines. According to the present invention, the above mentioned undesired transient response TRES can be minimized or substantially eliminated. Now, a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be explained. Figure 8 shows a timing pull in device according to the present invention. In Fig. 8, the reference numbers the same as in Fig. 5 denote components having the same function, respectively. An impulse recovery unit 12 regenerates an impulse from an automatic equalization adjustment pattern containing an impulse component for the training, which will be explained in more detail later, and thereby obtains impulse series P where P The first equalizer 13 and a second equalizer 14 constitute an automatic equalizer disclosed in the Japanese Unexamined Publication No. 58 121838 EP A 97723 , which can perform high speed initialization. In this kind of automatic equalizer, the first equalizer 13 is set as the tap coefficient C This is, the first equalizer 13 is the kind of transversal filter which is set by the tap coefficient C This formula 2 shows that the equalized output signal ED1 becomes the autocorrelation series. The term of phase component in the equalized output signal ED1 is completely eliminated due to the existence of the term P A second equalizer 14 automatically equalizes the equalized output signal ED1 of the first equalizer 13 to output an equalized output signal ED2 as an output data. This second equalizer 14 calculates an inverse matrix of the autocorrelation series A A phase holder PSH 9 holds the timing signal extracted by the timing extraction unit 4 when the amplitude of the extracted timing signal is small, at the phase state when the amplitude thereof is large, and normalizes the amplitude thereof. A phase rotator PSR 6 calculates the complex conjugate e A carrier detection unit 11 detects the carrier of the received signal to output a carrier detection CD signal to indicating the existence of the received signal. An decision unit 15 decides the data from the equalized output signal of the second equalizer 14. A decision unit 15 makes a decision on the data from the equalized output ED2 of the second equalizer 14 and corrects the tap coefficient B Next, an explanation will be given of the operation of the device illustrated in Fig. 8 with reference to views for explaining the operation, given in Figs. 9A to 9D, a view for explaining the phase rotation, given in Fig. 10, and views for explaining pull in, given in Figs. 11 and 12. The received signal S If the receiving side receives the signal S The output of the roll off filter 5 is subjected to automatic gain control by the automatic gain controller 8, whereafter its timing component is extracted as shown by Fig. 9B by the timing extraction unit 4. From the demodulated output of the AGC 8, the normalized impulse X Therefore, the first equalizer 13 assumes an autocorrelation, whereby the phase of the equalized output ED1 thereof becomes always zero. Accordingly, the equalizing operation is carried out normally even if the phase of the timing signal of the received signal and the phase of the sampling clock from the phase locked loop 7 are different at the A D converter 2. In other words, the timing pull in is carried out instantaneously. The first equalizer 13 finds the autocorrelation series A On the other hand, the timing component of the timing extraction unit 4 is given to the phase rotator 6 via the phase holder 9, and thereby the timing phase e At this stage, the first equalizer 13 has the complex conjugate of the impulse response set and fix equalized, so the second equalizer 14 is a symmetrical equalizer with a symmetrical matrix. Therefore, the second equalizer 14 has initialization characteristics that are the reverse of those of the temporarily asymmetric impulse signal initialized symmetrically with respect to time, so the time required for initialization is shortened. Therefore, the training signal TR can be shortened and, therefore, the RS CS time can be greatly reduced. On the other hand, the timing extraction unit 4 extracts the timing component from the results of the demodulation, i.e., the output of the automatic gain controller 8, so the timing phase at the time of pull in must be held and the phase corrected. For this reason, the timing phase e In this way, using the training signal, a training series is performed, i.e., carrier detection, AGC adjustment, timing pull in, and equalization adjustment. A usual data reception operation is performed as follows On the other hand, the timing extraction unit 4 extracts the timing component from the demodulated signal from the automatic gain controller 8. The phase is rotated by exactly the pull in phase at the phase rotator 6 and the phase locked loop 7 controlled. As a result, the phase locked loop 7 carries out the frequency control by the phase jitter, i.e., frequency deviation, and carries out the frequency follow up control of the sampling clock of the A D converter 2. The operation for reception of a transmitted signal is performed in this way. Further, when the signal quality detector 17 integrates the error Er and the integrated value reaches a predetermined value, the quality degradation signal SQD is sent, whereupon the quality degradation is evaluated. As described above, in the pull in device according to the present invention, in order to pull the baud rate clock into the timing signal, the extracted timing component input to the phase locked loop 7 is rotated in phase, instead of phase jumping the sampling clock of the A D converter 2. Accordingly, the transient response due to the phase jump of the sampling clock at the A D converter 2 does not occur, and as a result, the training time may be shortened. A more detailed constitution of the pull in circuit shown in Fig. 8, and the operation thereof, will now be described. First, an example of the training pattern signal transmitted from the transmission side will be explained. Figures 13, 14, and 16 are views for explaining the training pattern in an embodiment of the present invention, and Fig. 15 is a block diagram explaining impulse recovery. The training pattern is 16 QAM signal and comprised of three segments SEG1, SEG2, and SEG3, as shown in Fig. 13A. Below, an explanation will be made of the pattern of each segment. The first transmission pattern of the training pattern, i.e., the segment SEG1, preferably satisfies the following conditions 1 CD detection is easy, 2 AGC automatic gain control pull in can be performed at high speeds i.e., the data of the line level can be extracted accurately , and 3 there is a timing component. The pattern which satisfies these three conditions is one in which the phase of Fig. 14 is shifted 90 degrees and assumes alternately points A and B of the same amplitude. As the training start pattern of segment SEG1, an AB pattern comprised of the six symbols ABABAB is used. Next, the segment SEG2 must be a pattern able to recover the first impulse together with the segment SEG1. On the other hand, the impulse recovery algorithm at the reception side, delays the input, i.e., received signal, by one symbol s worth of time by the tap 152, as shown in Fig. 15, obtains the sum with the received signal by the adder 153, which is further delayed by one symbol s worth of time by the tap 155, and then obtains the difference from the added output by the adder 156 to recover the impulse. Therefore, the segment SEG2 is designated as X₁ , X₂ , X₃ , X₄ , X₅ , X₆ and the optimal symbols for the impulse recovery are determined with reference to Fig. 16. The input IN, comprised of the segments SEG1 and SEG2, is A, B, A, B, A, B, X₁ , X₂ , X₃ , X₄ , X₅ , X₆ . If a one symbol shift exists at the tap T1, it becomes SX₁. Therefore, the added output at the adder 153 becomes SX₂. Further, if the added output SX₂ is shifted by one symbol s worth by the tap 155, it becomes SX₃. When the difference is obtained by the adder 156, the output OUT of the difference becomes A, B, 0, 0, 0, 0, X₁ A, X₂ B, X₃ X₁ , X₄ X₂ , X₅ X₃ , X₆ X₄ , X₅ , X₆ . Therefore, X₁ to X₆ for recovery of the first impulse Z of Fig. 13B are determined as follows with reference to the QAM pattern of Fig. 14 The maximum power of X₁ A is obtained with X₁ A, so is with the point C rotated 180 degrees from the point A in the phase plane of Fig. 14. Therefore, X₁ X₃ X₅ C. On the other hand, X₂ , X₄ , X₆ is the point B rotated 90 degrees from the point C. In this way, the pattern of the segment SEG2 for recovering the first impulse Z can be found from the CB pattern comprised of the six symbols CBCBCB . If the segment SEG1 is determined as an AB pattern and the segment SEG2 as a CB pattern in this way and the segment SEG3 is similarly sought in the same way as above as a pattern enabling recovery of a second impulse with the segment SEG2, then the segment SEG3 becomes a DC pattern comprised of six symbols DCDCDC . The training pattern becomes as shown in Fig. 14. The patterns in the segments SEG1, SEG2, and SEG3 are comprised of points perpendicularly intersecting in the phase space in Fig. 14. Among the segments SEG1, SEG2, and SEG3, it should be noted, one of the component points of a former segment is included as one of the component points of a latter segment. On the other hand, if the segment SEG2 is X₂ B Z impulse , then X₂ B and X₁ A, X₃ A, X₄ X₂ B, X₅ X₃ A, X₆ X₄ D and the pattern may be a DA pattern comprised the six symbols DADADA too. In this case, either the DC pattern or the BA pattern may be selected for the segment SEG3. In this way, as shown in Fig. 13A, the segments SEG1, SEG2, and SEG3 are used for the recovery of the second impulse. Figure 17 shows detailed equivalent circuit diagrams of the demodulator 3, the roll off filter 4, and the automatic gain controller 8. In Fig. 17, 31 and 32 are multipliers for demodulating and outputting a real part component X and an imaginary part component Y by multiplying carriers cosϑ and sinϑ respectively. 50X is an X side roll off filter 50X comprising n stages of delay circuits tap 51 The automatic gain controller 8 comprises multipliers 80 Figure 18 is a detailed circuit diagram of the timing extraction unit 4 and the phase holder 9 illustrated in Fig. 8. In the figure, reference numerals the same as those shown in Fig. 8 indicate the same parts. Reference numerals 41 and 42 are timing extraction filters, for example, 1200 Hz band filters, which extract the timing components of the band of the timing signals in the real part and imaginary part AX and AY from the automatic gain controller 8. Reference numerals 43 and 44 are squaring circuits which square the output of the filters 41 and 42. Reference numeral 45 is an adder, which adds the outputs of the squaring circuits 43 and 44 and obtains the power of the timing component. Reference numeral 46 is a low pass filter, for example, a 2400 Hz band pass filter, which eliminates the alternating component in the signal from the adder 45 and outputs the timing component TX. Reference numeral 47 is a 90 degree component detector, which outputs the Y timing component TY rotated 90 degrees from the X timing component TX of the low pass filter 46. The phase holder 9 is provided to replace a small amplitude signal of the timing component with a large amplitude signal of the prior timing component, to prevent an increase of the phase jitter due to the frequency adjustment by the small amplitude signal. The phase holder 9 compares the timing components TX and TY taming extracted at the timing extractor 4 with a predetermined threshold TH. If the timing component is above the threshold TH, the timing component is held. If below the threshold TH, the held timing component is output as the timing data TX and TY . Reference numeral 9a is a timing phase hold circuit, which circuit is comprised of a vector judgement unit 90 and a hold unit 91. This circuit compares the timing components TX and TY from the timing extraction unit 4 with the threshold TH. If the vector component is greater than the threshold TH, it holds the timing components TX and TY and then outputs. If lower than the threshold TH, it outputs the held timing components TX and TY as the timing data TX and TY . Reference numeral 9b is an amplitude normalizing circuit, which is comprised of a vector component calculator 92 and a normalizer 93. This circuit normalizes the outputs XTMR and XTMI from the timing phase hold circuit 9a to the amplitude of a circle with a radius 1. Reference numerals 901 and 902 are multipliers which square the timing components TX and TY. Reference numeral 903 is an adder, which adds the outputs TX² and TY² of the multipliers 901 and 902 to obtain the vector component TX² TY² of the timing components. Reference numeral 904 is a subtractor, which performs subtraction on the vector component TX² TY² and a predetermined threshold TH. Reference numeral 905 indicates a polarity decision unit DEC2 which determines the polarity of the output TX² TY² TH of the subtractor 904 and makes the control output ATL 1 and BTL 0 if the polarity is positive, i.e. TX² TY² TH, and makes the control output ATL 0 and BTL 1 if the polarity is negative, i.e., TX² TY² TH. Reference numerals 911 and 912 are multipliers, which multiply the timing components TX and TY and the control output ATL. Reference numerals 913 and 914 are adders, which add the outputs from the multipliers 911 and 912 and the multipliers 915 and 916 to issue outputs XTMR and XTMI. The multipliers 915 and 916 multiply the outputs of the taps 917 and 918 and the control output BTL and output the results to the adders 913 and 914. The taps 917 and 918 hold the outputs XTMR and YTMI of the adders 913 and 914 and output to the multipliers 915 and 916. Reference numerals 921 and 922 are multipliers, which multiply the outputs XTMR and XTMI by 1 Figure 19 is a detailed circuit diagram of the phase rotator 6 shown in Fig. 15. In the figure, 60 is a complex conjugate calculator, which calculates the complex conjugates Figure 20 is a detailed diagram of the impulse recovery unit 12, first equalizer 13, second equalizer 14, and decision unit 15 shown in Fig. 8. The impulse recovery unit 12 has an extraction circuit REP 121 for extracting the data series P The first equalizer 13 has a first equalized output circuit OPU1 131, which has received data RD0 from the automatic gain controller 8 written in as first tap data and which calculates the first equalized output ED1 from the first tap data and first tap coefficient C The second equalizer 14 has a second equalized output circuit OPU2 141, which has the equalized output data ED1 written in as third tap data and which calculates the second equalized output ED2 from the third tap data ED1 and the second tap coefficient B Figure 21D is a waveform chart of the recovered impulse, Figs. 22A and 22B are views for explaining phase holding, and Fig. 23 is a flow chart of the initialization operation. First, an explanation will be made of the initialization of the first equalizer 13 and second equalizer 14 with reference to Fig. 21 and Fig. 23. A received data series, which is denominated by a complex number corresponding to the training signal TR demodulated at the demodulator 3, the roll off filter 5, and the automatic gain controller 8 is supplied to the impulse extraction circuit 121, where the received data series is added to the delayed data series obtained by delaying the received data series by one data symbol. That is, as shown in Fig. 21, the training data SA1 and the delayed data SA2 obtained by delaying the training data SA1 by one data symbol is added, whereby an impulse series SA3, which is an impulse recovery signal SA3 having only a central component P₀ whose amplitude is not zero and other components of zero. The impulse recovery signal SA3 shown in Fig. 21C shows an ideal case where no distortion of the line exists. However, in practice, as shown in Fig. 21D, the impulse series P The data series P where, P Next, the data series Pj is divided by P so as to normalize the impulse. If the normalized data series is X The normalized data series X The normalized data series X The complex numbers are expressed by real parts and imaginary parts. for the remaining A Here, it is found that A The autocorrelation series A The data series B The equalized output S is the data series S The correction of the tap coefficient B where, Er is the real part of E. For the other B In the correction of B With the above steps, the initializations of the tap coefficients C Next, an explanation will be made of the initialization of the timing recovery with reference to Figs. 22A and 22B. The received data series of the training signal TR of the afore mentioned step S010 is input into the timing extraction unit 4. At the timing extraction unit 4, the timing components are extracted by the timing extraction filters 41 and 42. These are then squared by the squaring circuits 43 and 44 and added by the adder 45, whereafter the power is sought. The alternating component is cut by the low pass filter 46 and the timing X component TX is obtained. Further, the timing Y component TY is prepared from the timing X component TX by the 90 degree component detector 47. If the timing components TX and TY are given from the timing extraction unit 4 to the timing phase hold circuit 9a of the timing phase holder 9, the timing components TX and TY are squared by the multipliers 901 and 902 of the vector judgement unit 90. The results are added by the adder 903 and the vector component TX² TY² is obtained. This vector component has subtracted from it the threshold TH by the subtractor 904 and then is applied to the polarity decision unit 905. The polarity decision unit 905 makes the control output ATL 1 and the control output BTL 0 if the output of the subtractor 905 is positive, i.e., vector component TX² TY² TH. Therefore, if the vector component is greater than or equal to TH, the timing components TX and TY are output from the multipliers 911 and 912 to the adders 913 and 914 as they are. On the other hand, since the control output BTL is 0 , the multipliers 915 and 916 do not output to the adders 913 and 914. The timing components TX and TY are therefore output from the adders 913 and 914 as the outputs XTMR and XTMI and held by the taps 917 and 918. Conversely, the polarity decision unit 905 makes the control output ATL 0 and the control output BTL 1 if the vector component TX2 TY2 is less than TH. Since the control output BTL is 1 , the held values of the taps 917 and 918 are input into the adders 913 and 914 and the held values of the taps 917 and 918 are output as the outputs XTMR and YTMI of the adders 913 and 914. Therefore, if the vector component of the timing component as shown in Fig. 22A is greater than or equal to the threshold TH, the timing components TX and TY are output and held. Conversely, if the vector component of the timing component is less than the threshold, the prior held timing component is output. The outputs XTMR and YTMI are applied to the circuit 9 The IV ROM 931 outputs the inverse numbers of the vector component. The outputs XTMR and YTMI are multiplied with the inverse numbers by the multipliers 932 and 933, whereby the timing data TX and TY shown in Fig. 10 with the radius 1 are obtained. Therefore, the portion from the time t₁ to the time t₂ of Fig. 22A below the threshold is replaced by the timing component of the time t₁ above the threshold as shown in Fig. 22B. In other words, during the portion below the threshold, the phase of the timing component just prior to that is held and output. The timing phases during that time become the same even if they were actually varied. During this time, desynchronization occurs and the phase jitter increases, but the time where the timing component is small does not continue long and further the phase fluctuation during that time is small, so substantially the minimum phase jitter can be obtained. On the other hand, when the timing component is small, even if a synchronization operation is performed, synchronization may not be possible or the synchronization operation may be erroneous, so the phase jitter can become large. This timing data TX and TY is input to the phase rotator 6. As previous mentioned, during the training, the complex conjugate calculator 60 takes the complex conjugate values of the timing data TX and TY and sets them into the registers 61 and 62. In this way, in anticipation of the completion of the initialization in the receiver side MODEM, the transmitter side MODEM commences the transmission of the send data. At the receiver side MODEM, the received data signal is demodulated to the data series by the demodulator 3 and supplied to the first equalizer 13. In the first equalizer 13, the received data series is processed by the equalized output circuit 131 using the tap coefficient C The above mentioned demodulated data series is input to the timing extraction unit TMGEXT 4, where the timing components TX and TY are extracted. These are then amplitude corrected at the phase holder 9, normalized, and input to the phase rotator 6. At the phase rotator 6, the normalized timing components TX and TY are multiplied by the multipliers 63 and 64 with the complex conjugates of the registers 61 and 62 for phase rotation and control of the phase locked loop 7. At the phase locked loop 7, the phase jitter is adjusted. Although a preferred embodiment has been described heretofore, various modifications and alterations are possible within the scope of the present invention. For example, figure 24 is a structural view of another embodiment of the present invention. In the figure, portions the same as those shown in Fig. 15 are indicated by the same references. In this embodiment, a phase rotator 6 is not provided in comparison with the equipment of Fig. 8. The timing extraction unit 4 is designed to perform the timing recovery from the equalized output ED1 of the first equalizer EQL1 13. Further, in this embodiment, the processing of the digital signal processor DSP and the microprocessor MPU is shown by equivalent blocks. The demodulator 3, the roll off filter 5, and AGC 8 are the same as in Fig. 17. The timing extraction unit 4 and the phase holder 9 are the same as in Fig. 18. The impulse recovery unit 12, the first equalizer 13, the second equalizer 14, and the judgement unit 15 are the same as in Fig. 20. The initialization in this embodiment may be just enough for the afore mentioned initialization of the first equalizer 13 and the second equalizer 14, by which timing pull in and equalization pull in training are performed. That is, the phase component has been erased from the equalized output ED1 of the first equalizer 13, i.e., the phase of the equalized output EP1 is zero. Therefore, since the timing extraction unit 4 of Fig. 23 performs a timing recovery from the equalized output ED1, a phase rotation is not necessary for supplying the timing component to the phase locked loop 7. Therefore, during the data reception, no phase rotation is necessary, and, the phase locked loop 7 is adjusted as to phase jitter by the output of the timing extraction unit 4. In this embodiment, compared with the afore mentioned embodiment, there is the advantage that no initial setting for the phase rotation or rotation operation are required. However, at a transmission speed of 9600 baud the first equalizer 13 must process at 9.6 kHz. Higher speed processing is sought compared with the construction of Fig. 15. Further, there are sometimes delay effects due to the first equalizer 13.
