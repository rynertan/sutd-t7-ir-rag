## Description
PRESSURE SENSITIVE OPTRODE The invention relates to optical means for rerotely measuring pressure and, particularly, for ir vasive, or direct, measurement of arterial blood pressure. In medicine, invasive measurement of arterial blood pressure is necessary in the management of critically ill patients or those undergoing complex surgical procedures. two methods are currently available for direct blood pressure measurements. the first, and most widely used, involves insertion of a fluid filled catheter into an artery so that the arterial lumen is hydraulically coupled to an external pressure sensing device. Highly accurate arterial pressure pulse measurements are difficult, If not impossible, however, because the natural frequency of the hydraulic coupling coincides with frequencies of physiological interest. Moreover, the frequency response is variable, depending on the length of the catheter tubing and other unpredictable factors, such as the presence of small bubbles, leaks, or overly compliant plastic tubing used as connectors.Tnese latter factors have impeded attempts to electronically compensate for the undesirable characteristics of the nydraulic coupling. The other method of direct arterial blood pressure measurement involves the use of miniature solid state or strain gauge transducers mounted on the tip of a catheter. Although catheter tip manometers introduce little or no distortion into the pressure signal, a number of practical problems restrict their routine clinical use. The transducers are expensive, and their fragility limits the number of uses for a single catheter. They exhibit DC electrical drift1 requiring the use of a flub filled lumen or separate catheter to obtain absolute values of arterial pressure.Also, there have been reported instances of mechanical failure of the catheter tip. introflucing additional clinical hazards. in the area of industrial process control, monitoring reactor vessel pressure is critical for safe ano automated operation of nuclear power plants. Pressurized water and boiling water reactors operate at pressures ranging from 1000 1600 psi and temperatures ranging from 250 350 C. Such conditions1 together with the corrosive effects of water and high radiation levels, limit the choice of sensors available for monitoring pressure. Mechanical pressure transducers, such as bellows and diaphragms, are frequently used. however, the transducers are typically external to the reactor vessel, and require that pressure signals be transmitted through fluid conduits. Elimination of such instrument piping is highly desirable where toxic or corrosive fluids are involved, or where even minor leaks lead to severe disruptions in plant operation. In adoption, tubing interposed between the point of measurement and the transducers adversely affects the system s frequency response. Strain gauge pressure transducers are highly accurate and can be used in hostile environments.However, there are drawbacks to their use. If pressure measurements must be precise, and there are wide and suooen changes in ambient temperature, thermal protection is necessary. High pressure spikes such as those caused by rapid opening or closing of valves. can damage the transducers. Finally, signal transmission from a strain gauge transducer to point of readout Is by electrical wiring. while this eliminates the response time lag encountered whenever a fluid signaltransmission medium is used, electrical wiring is subject to corrosion heat damage, and breakage. Many of the above mentioned difficulties with current pressure sensing technology can be overcome by using remote, in situ mechanical transducers coupled to a aetector by optical waveguides, or fiber optics. Fiber optics are durable1 corrosion resistant, heat resistant, and are available in very small diameters, which makes them amenable for use with miniaturized transducers. Brogardh, in U.S. Patent 4,270,050, dated May 25, 1981, discloses a remote pressure sensing device which employs a transducer connected to a detector by a fiber optic. Pressure is sensed by measuring stressinduced changes in the absorption spectrum of a material placed in the path of an Illumination beam at the site of the transducer. The transducer includes the stresssensitive material and a means for converting pressure into a mechanical stress directea to the stresssensitive material. A problem with materials that have stressdependent absorption spectra is that the spectral changes are also temperature dependent. Thus, for reasonable accuracy over appreciable temperature ranges, temperature stabilization is requireo. Another problem involves the need for converting pressure to stress on the sensitive material. The primary transducer for carrying out this conversion can impair the system s response time, and can increase the difficulty of ailniaturization. Ho, in U.S. Patent 41158,3101 dated June 19, 1979, discloses a fiber optical pressure sensor which requires a cable of fibers and a deformable diaphragm having a reflective surface. The cable is divided at one end into two bundles, one of which is irradiated by a light source, and the other which directs reflected light to a detector. The irradiated fibers are distributed randomly among the fibers of the uneivfoed part of the cable, which in turn is directed to tne reflective surface of the deformable diaphragm.The other side of the diaphragm is in contact with the pressurized medium. The curvature of the diaphragm increases in response to increases in pressure, so that less light is reflected onto the fibers leading to the detector. Thus, the Intensity of light collected by tne detector varies inversely with the ambient pressure The use of a fiber cable and diaphragm makes miniaturization difficult, if not impossible. Cables also substantially increase the cost of the sensor, especially in remote sensing applications. The foregoing illustrates the limitations of the current pressure sensing technology. An alternative to available pressure sensing methods which overcame some of these limitations would be highly advantageous for remote pressure sensing applications, particularly in situ measurement of arterial blood pressure. In the present invention 1 a fiber optic is provided through which light from at least one associated light source is transmitteo from a first end of the fiber optic to a second end of the fiber optic1 2 light emanating from the secona ena of the fiber optic Illuminates a fluorescent composition causing it to fluoresce, 3 a resilient means associated with the second end of the fiber optic causes the fluorescent composition to move back and forth along the axis of the fiber optic in response to changes in pressure, and 4 the same fiber optic carrying the illumination beam for exciting the fluorescent composi tion collects and transmits fluorescent emissions to the first end of the fiber optic where said emissions are separated from the illumination beam and analyzed.The magnitude of the fluorescent signal collected by the fiber optic depends on the intensity of the illumination beam, the type of fluorescent composition used, and the distance of the fluoreseent composition from the end of the fiber optic. The invention is operated by placing the resilient means in contact with the fluid whose pressure is to be monitored. The resilient means causes the fluorescent composition to move toward the second end of the fiber optic whenever pressure increases and to move away from the second end of the fiber optic whenever pressure decreases. Thus1 with constant illumination intensity1 high pressures give rise to more intense signals and lower pressures give rise to less intense signals.Preferably, the range of movement of the fluorescent composition substantially includes a region of maximal sensitivity adjacent to the end of the fiber optic. This region is roughly defined by the numerical aperture of the fiber optic and is described more fully below. The present invention is addressed to problems associated with remote pressure monitoring in hostile or inaccessible regions. It sets out to overcome many of these problems by combining rugged, high quality fiber optics with simple in situ transducers for generating optical signals related to ambient pressure.For blood pressure measurements. the problem of poor frequency response may be overcome by the in situ pressure transducer and by the availability of small.diameter1 catheter sized communications type fiber optics and hydraulically based resilient means for transducing changes in pressure to displacements of a fluorescent composition.For hostile environments involving high temperatures, high pressures, corrosives, and the like, the problem of providing reliable and durable in situ pressure sensors may be overcame by the availability of mechanical transducers fabricated from durable alloys, such as zirconium, stainless steel, nickel alloys, and the like by the availability of strong, heat resistant, corrosion resistant fiber optics and by the ability to combine these elements to form simple, yet effective pressure sensors, based on the principles taught by the present invention. in addition, all particular embodiments of the invention are amenable for use with a multi position sensing system which comprises many sensors, all of which feed signals to a single station for analysis. Such a configuration can reduce costs by obviating the neeo for separate analyzers for each sensor, and can increase reproducibility between sensors by having all sicnals analyzed by the same instrument. The present invention is further described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a cross sectional view of a pressure sensitive optrode incorporating a bellows as the resilient means. Figure 2 is a cross sectional view of a pressure sensitive optrode incorporating a diaphragm as the resilient means. Figure 3 is a cross sectional view of a pressure sensitive optrode incorporating a piston as the resilient means. Figure 4 is a cross sectional view of a pressure sensitive optrode incorporating a plastic bubble as the resilient means. Figure 5 is a cross sectional view of a pressure sensitive optrode incorporating a fluid column in a tube as the resilient means. Figures 6A 6C illustrate steps of the preferred method of manufacturing the preferrea embodiment of the invention which employs a fluid column in a tube as the resilient means. Figure 7 illustrates relative signal intensity as a function of differential pressure for an embodiment employing a bellows as the resilient means. Figure 8 illustrates the relative signal intensity as a function of time generated by an embodiment of the invention employing a fluid column in a tube as the resilient means. In accordance with the present invention an apparatus is provided for measuring fluid pressure via an in situ fluorescent probe which mechanically or hydraulically couples changes in fluid pressure to changes in fluorescent signal intensity. A resilient means, e.g., a bellows, diaphragm, or fluid column in a tube, attached to one end of a fiber optic constitutes the mechanical or hydraulic coupling. The resilient means causes a fluorescent composition to move back and forth relative to the end of the fiber optic in response to changes in pressure. Light emanating from the fiber optic illuminates the fluorescent composition inducing it to fluoresce. The same fiber optic collects a portion of the fluorescent emissions. The magnitude of the optical signal collected by the fiber optic depends in part on the numerical aperture of the fiber optic and in part on the distance of the fluorescent emitter from the end of the fiber optic. Light collected by a fiber optic is transmitted essentially loss free along the length of the fiber optic only if it enters the fiber at an angle less than or equal to a characteristic angle depending on the composition of the fiber optic from the normal to the end face of the fiber optic.Because of this, the space adjacent to the face of the fiber can be divided into three regions according to whether all, some, or no light emanating from a point in the adjacent space and impinging on the face of the fiber core will be trans mitted by the fiber. in a step index fiber optic the regions are defined by two concentric cones, as shown in cross section by lines 78, 78 , 79, and 79 in Figure 5. The conical region defined by the cone shown in cross section by lines 78 and 78 will be referrea to as the region of maximal sensitivity. The conical region defined by the cone shown in cross section by lines 79 ano 79 is sometimes referred to as the acceptance cone of the fiber optic, e.g., Kleecamp and Metcalf, bDesigner s buide to Fiber Optics1 Cahners Publishing Company, Boston, MA, 1978 . As mentioned above, the conical regions are a general characteristic of fiber optics and are not a special feature of the embodiment of the invention shown in Figure 5. Thus, every fiber optic has a region of maximal sensitivity although it may not have the same geometry as that indicated inFigure 5, e.9., the fiber optic could be of the graded. index variety. The amount of light collected by the fiber from a light emitting body moving along the axis of the concentric cones is a well defined monotonically varying function of the distance between the face of the fiber optic and the body. The precise relationship is determined empirically, although theoretical derivations are possible. Once determined the function can be stored in tabular form in the memory of a microprocessor which is part of a detection means operationally asso crated with the first end of the fiber optic. Alter natively, the function can be embodied in a nonlinear analog compensator network which provides an electrical output directly proportional to pressure. Preferably, the range of movement of the fluorescent composition during operation substantially includes the region of maximal sensitivity of the fiber optic. That is, the range of movement preferably includes the subregion adjacent to the apex of the conical region aefined in cross section in Figure 5 by lines 78 and 78 . In this region a single fiber optic used both for fluorescent excitation and collection is more efficient than a multi fiber system In which separate fibers are used for excitation and for collection. Efficiency here is used in the sense of intensity of signal collected for a given power of the excitation beam.The extent of this region of superior efficiency depends on the numerical apertures of the fiber optics, the distances between the cores of collection fibers and illumination or excitation fibers in the multi fiber system. Preferably, the range of movement of the fluorescent composition does not comprise the region between tne end of the fiber optic and the apex of the cone defining the region of maximal sensitivity.Signals generated by a fluorescent composition in the region between the apex of said cone and the end of the fiber optic are highly nonlinear and cannot be translated into pressures as reliably as signals generated by the fluorescent composition when positioned distally to the apex of said cone. The distance between the end of fiber optic and the apex of said cone depends on the numerical aperture of fiber optic The greater the numerical aperture the smaller the distance between the apex of said cone and the end of the fiber optic. In accordance with the invention a single fiber optic is employed for both illumination and collection. Thus, the invention includes means 32 for separating the outgoing illumination beam from the incoming fluorescence at the first end of the fiber optic, as shown diagramatically in Figures 1, 2 and 3, as well as detection means 36. shown diagramatically in Figures 1, 2, and 3. Several means are available for such separation, such as a dicnroic which separates on the basis of wavelength, an apertured mirror which separates on the basis of the spatial distribution of the incoming and outgoing beams, or the like. Examples of these beam splitting means are provided in Iiirschfeld, U.S.Patent Application Serial No, 480,844 filed 31 March 1983 continuation of application Serial No. 194,684 filec 6 October 1980, now abandoned , which is incorporated by reference. Preferably, the illumination beam is gener ted by a light source 34 in Figures 1, 2 and 3 operating at a frequency at or near the maximum absorp tion frequency of the fluorescent composition. Suitable light sources include lasers, mercury arc lamps, or light emitting diodes, for example, Detection means 36 includes photoelectric means for measuring the intensity of the collected fluorescence. Such photoelectric means are well known in the art.For example, Optical industry and Systems Purchasing Directory, Vol. 1 and II Optical Publishing Co., Inc., Pittsfield, HA, 1982 , Photomultiplier Manual RCA Corporation, Garrison, NJ, 1970 , na Handbook of Optics, Section Four, c6row Hill Book Company, New York, 1978 are guides to suitable photoelectric means. Parker, in Photoluminescence of Solutions Elsevier Publishing Company, NewYork, 1968 provides an extensive discussion of apparatus for measuring fluorescence. More than one light source operating at different wavelengths may be preferred when fluorescent compositions are used that comprise more than one kind of fluorescent molecule. Each fluorescent molecule has a preferrea range of excitation wavelengths. An lllumi nation beam operating within the preferred range readily produces fluorescent emission an illumination beam operating outside the preferred range induces little or no fluorescence. Thus, where more than one kinci of fluorescent molecule is used, optimal performance may call for a plurality of light sources, each operating within a preferred wavelength range of the respective fluorescent molecules. Detection of a plurality of fluorescent signals may call for a plurality of separation means 32 and attendent detection means 36. As indicated in the examples below, a wide range of fluorescent compositions can be used In actor dance with the present invention depending on the Intended application and the resilient means employed. Fluorescent compositions are attaches to the resilient means by mixing with a transparent glue or other binoing agent, or by soaking a diffuse reflector, for example, paper or silica gel, with a solution containing the fluorescent compositions then attaching the diffuse reflector to the resilient means. Examples of such commercially available fluorescent compositions inc rude fluorescein, and eosin. where operability at high temperature is critical, various solid materials capable of lasing are available for use as fluorescent compositions. By way of example, transition metal or rare earth doped glasses can be used, including, but not limited to uranyl doped glass. Wafers or powders of the material can be glued to the resilient means, or the material can be deposit4 on a surface of the resilient means in molten form. Crystalline laser materials, for example ruby or neody mium doped crystals, are also suitable fluores cent compositions. A large number of pressure to motion trans ducers can be used as resilient means in accordance with the invention, such as bellows 6 in Figure 1, diaphragm 16 In Figure 2, piston 18 in Figure 3, and fluid column 72 and tube 68 in Figure 5. In the case of the embodi ment in Figure 3, piston 18 moves back and forth within the bore of collar 12, and compresses the gas trapped in the region indicated by 11 whenever ambient pressure increases. Much of the technology associated with the design of pressure actuated switches is directly applicable to choosing a suitable resilient means for a particular emobidment of the invention.Accordingly,Lyons, The Designer s Handbook of Pressure Sensing Device, Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, 1980 is incorporated by reference. The following examples illustrate particular embodiments of the invention, methods of manufacture, and particular applications. Example 1 Bellows as resilient means. Figure 1 illustrates an embodiment of the invention employing bellows 6 as a resilient means. Fluorescent composition 8 is attached to surface 4 of the bellows. Fiber optic 2 illuminates fluorescent composition 8 and collects the resulting fluorescent emissions. Collar 12 allows bellows 6 to be attachea to fiber optic 2 and includes vent 14 so that bellows compression is determined solely by the ambient pressure and the effective spring constant of the bellows. Vent 14 is not critical to the invention. The choice of a particular bellows is dictated by several factors, such as the operating temperature range, the nature of the pressurized fluid with which the bellows will be in contact, the operating pressure range, the expected frequency of pressure fluctuations, and so on. For power plant applications, resistance to corrosive fluids, durability, and operability at high, and possibly varying, temperature are crucial design constraints. in the absense of crucial size constraints, commercially available stainless steel bellows can be employed. For use in a nuclear reactor vessel, zirconium bellows can also be fabricated. A commercially available stainless steel bellows Servometer Corp., Cedar Grove, SJ was employed in one embodiment. The diameter of the bellows, dirnension 10 in Figure 1, was 1 4 g 0.64 an . The stainless steel bellows 6 was silver soldered onto metal collar 12, which includea vent 14. Fluorescent composition 8 comprised filter paper soaked in fluoroscein. Fiber optic 2 was a 200 meter, 200 micron diameter Valtec PC lO Valtec Optical Group, Waltham, XA . The light source was an argon laser operating at 488 nm and 10 mw, and the photoelectric means was a Spex double monochro meter Spex Corp., Zetuchen, NJ .Figure 7 illustrates the relative signal Intensity as a f nction of differed t5ul pressure for this embodiment. Example 2 Miniaturizec Resilient Means Another embodiment especially amenable to miniaturization employs a resilient means which comprises plastic bubble 40 with Interior 42 in Figure 4 attached to the second end 44 of fiber optic 46, that is, the distal end of fiber optic 46 relative to the detection means and the light source. A fluorescent composition can either be mixed with the plastic material forming bubble 40 or the fluorescent composition can be attached as a coating, as illustrated by 48 in Figure 4. Bubble 40 of this embodiment of the pressure sensitive optrode can be formea in at least two ways. First, a mixture is formed which comprises a plastic dissolved in a volatile solvent. Second, a small quantity of the mixture is placed on the second end of the fiber optic. And third, an ill mination beam Is directeci Into the first end of the fiber optic at an elevated power level, so that the attached droplet of mixture begins to heat and a bubble 40 forms.A second method of constructing this embod1 ment includes steps of dissolving a plastic in a vessel containing a volatile solvent, agitating the resulting solution until small spheroidal bubbles form at the surface of the liquid, attaching one of the preformed bubbles to the second end of the fiber optic, and allowing the volatile solvent to evaporate, leaving the plastic bubble 44 attached to second end 40 of fiber optic 46. A fluarescent ccrrpositicol may be applied to the outside of the bubble or blended with plastic solvent mixture prior to forming the bubbles.By way of example, the first of the above described methods for constructing a miniature optrode has been implemented with collodion J.T. Baker ChemicalCo., Phf psburgb PA , a nitrocellulose based plastic U.S.P. specifications pyroxylln 40 g, ether 750 ml, alcohol 250 ml . A droplet, approximately .05 milliliters, is placeo on the end of a Valtec PC lO fiber optic Valtec Optical Group, Waltham, MA . A beam of lignt from an argon laser, operating at 488 nm, at approximately 1 watt, and for approximately 30 seconds, was used to form bubble 40. After cooling, the bubble was coated with a thIn layer of fluorescein. The operating power of the Illumination beam was approxl mately 100 m watts. Since the bubbles attached to the end of the fiber optic may be chosen so that their diameters are no larger than the diameter of the fiber optic, this embodiment Is particularly well adapted to applications where miniature pressure sensors are required. Example 3 Fluid Column in m Tube as Resilient Mee s Figure 5 is a cross section of an embodiment employing r fluid column In a tube as the resilient means. Fiber optic 60, with cladding 62, core 64, ano protective sheath 66, is fixedly attached to a first end 90 of tube 68. Fixing means 70 for attaching fiber optic 60 to tube 68 can be an adhesive, for example an epoxy. cyanoacrylate, or cellulose adhesive. Alternatively, where the tube comprises a glass capillary tube, the tube may be welded to the end of the fiber optic. For medical applications, tube 68 preferably comprises a catheter sized tube, I.e., a tube amenable to Insertion into the lumen of a vein or artery, made of material resistant to corrosion by physiological fluids, for example glass, plastic, stainless steel, nickel or nickel alloys. More preferably tube 68 comprises a catheter sl2ed tube less than a millimeter in diameter. It is important that fixing means 70 form an air tight seal between the end of fiber optic 60 and tube 68.An air space, or bubble of trapped gas, 80 surrounding the second end of the fiber optic is comperes when Increasing pressure drives a column of fluid 72, having a first surface 74 and a second surface 76, toward fiber optic 60. Preferably the range of movement of colum n through the bore of tube 68 should substantially include the region defines by the cone shown in cross section in Figure 5 by lines 78 and 78 adjacent to its apex, I.e., the region of maximal sensitivity described above. The fluid column 72 comprises a fluorescent material mixed with any fluid which is sufficiently viscous to remain in the bore of tube 68 and which is immiscible with the fluid whose pressure is to be determined. The fluid containing the fluorescent material is referred to as the carrier fluid. For physiological uses, hydrophobic fluids are preferred as the carrier fluid, e.g. fats or waxes. Fats are especially preferred because they are non toxic, they can be mixed to obtain a wide range of melting points, ana there are many fat soluble fluorescent materials. Fats with melting points above room temperature and below body temperature are most preferred for invasive blood pressure measurements. Such melting points allow the optrode to be handled and transported with the fat in solid form. which lessens the chances of contact. nation or loss of the fluid column 72. By way of example, olein, palmitic, and stearin can be mixed in various proportions to obtain melting points between room. temperature and body temperature. For a guide to other fats which can be used in accordance with the present invention, see Baily, melting and Solidification of Fats Interscience Publishers, hew York and Karkley, Fatty Acids, 2nd edition lnterscfence Publishers, hew York . A host of fluorescent molecules can be used In accordance with the present embodiment. Fat soluble fluorescent molecules are preferred and, when structural formulas are available, can be selected according to ordinary solubility rules for organic molecules, e.g.,Shugar, et al., Chemical Technicians Ready Reference Handbook, Second Edition McGraw Hill Book Co., San Francisco, 1981 .Further selection can be made empirically. Many classes of fat soluble fluorescent molecules used as scintillator solutes are applicable for use in the present embodiment, e.g., p Oligophenylenes, such as p quaterphenyl oxazole and oxadiazole deriva troves. such as 2,5 diphenyloxazole the common scintil lator solute PPO and other ring systems e.g benzene, naphthalene, pyridine, pyrrole,or indole. Wehry and Rogers, in chapter three of Fluores cence and Phosphorescence Analysis, Hercules, editor Interscience Publishers, N.Y., 1966 , discuss generally the fluorescence of organic molecules used in scintil. latin detectors. Other fat soluble fluorescent molecules suitable for use in the present embodiment include, but are not limited to, methyl eosin, rhodamine 66, rhooamine 36, phosphine, tetracycline, chromoxane brilliant red BL, chlorophyll, alizarin rubinol, evans blue, procion yellow, cryptocyanine, pyrene, rubrene, N phenylnaphthylamine, victoria blue B, 7 ethoxyresoruf in, 2 hydroxystilbamidine, parinaric acid, sempervirene, l 6 diphenylhexatriene, P quaterphenyl, tetraphenyl butadiene, anthracene, bis P methylstyrenylbenzene, stilbene, terphenyl, vitamin h, and vitamin E. Non hazardous fat soluble fluorescent molecules are preferred for medical uses. Whether a particular fat soluble fluorescent molecule can be used in a non hazardous manner depends on several considerations l concentration of the fluorescent molecules necessary to generate measurable signals, 2 blood concentrations and duration of such concentrations that can cause toxic or genotoxic effects, and 3 the rate at which the fluorescent molecules leaks into the blooa stream during operation. More preferably, the fluorescent material comprises fluorescent particles dispersed in the carrier fluid. e.g., powders, microspheres, or microencapsulated fluorescent dyes. Techniques for iiicroencapsulating fluorescent dyes are described In Mosbach, ed., Methods InEnzymology, Viol. 441 immobilized Enzymes AcademicPress, NY, 1976 Vandegaer, ed., Microencapsulation Processes and Applications, Plenum Press, NY, 1975 , and Tondo, Microcapsule Processing and Technology Karcel Dekker, iNc., NY, 1976 . Fluorescent mRtros pheres are the most preferred fluorescent material.Fluorescent microspheres suitable for use with the present embodiment are available commercially either in forms mace from fluorescent compositions or in forms which can be rendered fluorescent by covalently attaching fluoresecent molecules e.g., Polyscience, inc. warrington, PA and Covalent Technology Corporation Redwood City, CA provide a variety of microsphere sizes and types suitable for use with the present embodiment . In either form fluorescent micro spheres are less likely to diffuse out of the carrier fluid than fluorescent molecules.Consequently, such fluorescent materials are safer, and the choice of applicable fluorescent molecules can be increased by covalently bonding otherwise unacceptably mobile or toxic molecules to microspheres. For medical or veterinary applications the optrode muSt either be constructed from materials which do not induce blood coagulation or more precisely, thrombogenesls or be treated with agents which prevent blood coagulation. Such materials and treatments are we known in the art. For example, Lemm, et al., Medical and Biological Engineering and Computation, Viol. 16, pp. 521 526 1980 and Francis, U.S. Patent 4,367,183 provide lists of commercially available thromboresistant materials or materials that can be rencered thromboresistant . Joh, U.S. Patent 4,329,383 Hammar, U.S. Patent 4,326,532 and Joh, U.S. Patent 4,4 5,490 contain reviews of methods for rendering materials thromboresistant. Maugh, Science, Vol. 217, pp. 1129 1130 1982 discusses the use of albumin coatings for reducing thrombogencicity. The preferred method of treatment is heparinization. The Joh and Hammar patents cited above deal primarily with methods of heparinization. Heparinization can be accomplished In several ways.For example, several commercial heparin coatings are available, such as Glassclad HP a tradenamed product from Petrach Systems Bristol, PA for heparinizing glass surfaces and TDMAC trt dode cy methyl ammonium chloride heparin available from Po ysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA .In the event that a f uorescent fluid coinprising r fat or fats possesses thrombogenic activity, It can be rendered nonthrombo genie by treatment with TDKAC.heparin. the TDMAC moiety of TDE,AC heparln has a lipophilic hydrocarbon chain whicn anchors the heparin molety on second surface 76 of the column of fluorescent fluid 72, thereby rendering it non thrombogenic. Example 4 Manufacture of Resilient Means Comprising a FluId Column In a Tube The first step in the preferred method of manufacturing the optrode employing a fluid column in tube as resilient means Is coaxially positioning ana fixedly attaching the second end of the fiber optic 60 to the first end 90 of tube 68 of predetermined inside diameter, indicated by dimension geb in Figure 5.Preferably, protective sheath 66 of the second end of fiber optic 60 is removed over a distance from the end face, Indicated by dimension d in Figure 4. Removing the protective sheath creates a larger bubble volume 80 which, In turn, allows the column of fluid 72 a greater range of travel for a given variation in pressure. As mentioned above the range of travel of the column of fluid 72 depends on bubble volume 80 and Inside diameter of tube 68. The best values for these parameters for a given application are determined empiricelly. The preferred range of travel for operation depends on the numerical aperture of the fiber optic, as discussed above.In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 4 the step of inserting and attaching includes inserting the fiber optic such that the distance, indicated by the letter c , Is known. The second step is placing the second end 92 of tube 68 in contact with a reservoir 100 Figure 6A of fluid under conditions wherein the surrounding gas 102 is at a first predetermined pressure, preferably below atmospheric pressure. The third step is increasing the pressure of the surrounding gas 102 in Figure 6B to a second predetermined pressure preferably still below atmospheric pressure while second end 92 of the tube Is still In contact with reservoir 100 of fluorescent fluid 100 so that a column 101 of the fluid is forced into the tube. The fourth step is removing the second end of the tube from the reservoir of fluid. The fifth step is increasing the pressure of the surrounding gas 102 Figure 6C , preferably to atmospheric pressure, so that fluid column 101 is drawn back from the second end of the tube by a predetermined distance indicated by letter n InFigure 5. Appropriate choices of the first and second predetermined pressures determines how close first surface 74 of the column of fluid 72 is to the end face of fiber optic 60, and how for second face 76 of the column of flub 72 Is recessed from the second end of the tube, 1.e., the distance Indicated by the letter in Figure 5.Preferably the temperature Is maintained at a level so that the fluid column Is in liquid form during the aboveldercribeo second through fifth steps. The first and second predetermined pressures are determined by straight forward application of the ideal gas law. For medical and veterinary applications, a step or steps of treating with thromboresistant agents must be made, if necessary. Before loading the fluid into the tube, the second end of the fiber optic and the tube are treated with a thromboresistant agent. Preferably this step comprises heparinizing. If the fluid contains thrombo genic agents an additional step of heparinizing must be made. For example, when the carrier fluid is a fat, after the fluid is loaded Into the tube, the additional step of heparinizing comprises treating second surface 76 of the column of fluid 72 with TDMAC heparin. Example S Operation of an Embodiment Employing a Fluid Column In a Tube as Resilient Means Figure 8 illustrates the performance of an example of an embodiment of the invention. Curve A ofFigure 8 is a reference pressure signal repeatedly generated by a Model 601A Blood Pressure Systems Calibrator BioTek Instruments, Inc., Burlington VT .Curve B of Figure 8 is the intensity of the optical signal generated by the particular embodiment in response to the reference pressure. Minor discrepancies between the curves exist because no signal processing means for linearizing the optrode s response signal were included in the detection means of the particular embodiment. The preferred embodiment includes such signal processing means. The particular embodiment corprised a fiber optic 140 pm cladding diameter, 100 ym core diameter, e.g., model 51140 from GeneralFiber Optics, Caidwell, N3 coaxially inserted approximately 300 pm into a glass capillary tube 300 pm inside diameter and 0.53 cm in length and glued in place with an epoxy adhesive.The fluorescent fluid comprised water with 300 ppm fluoroscein. The fluorescent fluid was loaded into the capillary tube so that first surface 74 of the column extended 500 pm into the tube from second end of the tube. Example 6 bual Pressure Temperature Sensor Ruby affords a means of constructing a dual pressure and temperature sensitive optrode within the purview of the subject Invention. Ruby fluoresces at two closely spaced wavelengths, designated the R1 andR2 lines. The relative intensity of the two lines is a function of ambient temperature. total signal intensity depends on both pressure and temperature. Hover, by measuring the relative intensity of the R1 and R2 emissions, not only can the temperature be determined. but also the temperature dependent contribution to the total fluorescent Intensity can be factored out to give an accurate pressure reading. This embodiment requires a special detection means for analyzing the fluorescent signal generated by the optrode. First, the detection means has a stored table of ordered pairs relating the values of the R11R2 intensity ratios to ruby temperatures. This table is referred to as the stored temperature ratio table.1 Second, the detection means has the capability of separately measuring the Intensity of the R1 e nission line, collected and separated from the illumi nation beam, the intensity of the R2 emissIon line, collected and separated from the Illumination beam, and the intensity of the total fluorescence collected and separated from the illumination beam. This litter intensity is referred to as the actual total fluorescence. By measuring the intensities of the R1 andR2 emission lines, the R1 R2 intensity ratio is formed, and the ruby temperature can be read from the stored temperature ratio table.Third, the detection means has a stored table of ordered pairs relating total ruby fluorescence to ruby temperature under the condition that the ruby is at a predetermined distance from the second end of the fiber optic. This table is referred to as the stored temperature intensity table. A value of total ruby fluorescence can be read from the stored temperature intensIty table, once the ruby temperature is obtained from the stored temperature ratio table. Fourth, the difference between the total ruby fluorescence obtained from the stored teit.perature intensity table and the actual total fluorescence is computed. This difference is referred to as the computed difference.Fifth, the detection means has a table of ordered pairs that relates differ ences between actual total fluorescences and total ruby fluorescences from the stored temperature intensity table to pressures. This table is referred to as the stored pressure intensity difference table. A value for pressure is read from the stored pressure intensity difference table, once the computed difference is obtained. The special detection means requirements for this embodiment are readily carried out with the assistance of a data acquisition computer, such as a DEC LSl ll Digital Equipment Corp., Waltham, MA . Another advantage of ruby is that the range of preferential wavelengths for fluorescent excitation Includes the output wavelength of helium neon lasers.Therefore, these inexpensive and readily available lasers can be used as light sources for pressure optrodes employing ruby as their fluorescent composi tions. Example 7 Measurement of Salt Concentration The subject invention can be adapted to measuring cnanges in salt concentrations by sensing changes in osmotic pressure across a predetermined ser1 permeable membrane. Such an adaptation requires that the resilient means of the pressure sensitIve optrode be enclosed by a hollow body with at least one port. The predetermined semi permeable membrane covers the port so that only water or selected Ions can enter the hollow body. By way of example, the hollow body could be a hollow cylinder surrounding the resilient means attached to the second end of the fiber optic by one end and open at the other end. In tnfs example, the port is the open end of the cylinder. The concentration of a known salt can be monitored by choosing a sem permeable membrane impermeable to the known salt, but permeable to the surrounding solvent. A quantity of the known salt is placed inside the hollow body so that the concentration inside the hollow body is the same as the concentration outside the hollow body. Under these conditions, no osmotic pressure is generated inside the hollow body therefore, no change occurs in the optical signal generated by the optrode. if the exterior salt concen tration changes, however, osmotic pressure arises inside the hollow body, causing the resilient means to move closer to or farther away from the second end of the fiber optic, depending on whether the outside concen traction change is an increase or decrease.In either case, the optical signal generated by the optrode makes a corresponding change.
