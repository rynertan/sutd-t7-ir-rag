# EPOXY PHOSPHATE AQUEOUS DISPERSIONS

## Abstract
Water dispersible epoxy phosphate ester polymer salts are disclosed which exhibit improved stability in coating compositions contining aminoplast or phenoplast resin. These salts are provided by reacting a resinous polyepoxide having at least about 1.4 oxirane groups per molecule with less than 0.9 mol of orthophosphoric acid for each oxirane equivalent in the polyepoxide to form a monoester reaction product containing residual epoxy functionality. The monoester reaction product so provided is then reacted with at least 1 mol of a volatile amine per equivalent of oxirane functionality in said monoester to provide a water dispersi ble product lacking oxirane functionality. Ether alcohols, and especially 2 butoxy ethanol, are relied upon to provide dispersions having low viscosity.
