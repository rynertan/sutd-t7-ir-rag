# High frequency energy source.

## Abstract
Energy source of a low power high frequency oscillator section 10 driving a high power high gain amplifier section 12 . The amplifier section 12 includes one or more SIT s Q2 . The dc operating potential is applied to the drain electrode of one of the SIT s Q2 and is supplied to the other through a dc path from the source electrode of the one SIT to the drain electrode of the other. Operating potential from the dc biasing network between the source and gate electrode of an SIT Q2 in the amplifier section is conducted through a dc path to a transistor Q1 in the oscillator section 10 to provide operating power for the oscillator section 10 . The oscillator output is connected through a high frequency coupling dc blocking path to the amplifier input to provide a drive signal to be amplified and extracted at the amplifier output 14 .
