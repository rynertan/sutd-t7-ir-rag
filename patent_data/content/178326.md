## Description
SPECIFICATIONDEHUMIDIFIER FOR CONTAINERSFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a dehumidifier for use in a container loaded on a ship, freight car or trailer.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Goods transported by a ship, freight train or trailer have been for the most part shipped packed in containers for many years. The control of humidity in the container has been a great problem in the transporation of containers, particularly in ocean transport which takes many days. To maintain the quality of goods in transit, it is desired to keep the humidity in the containers at levels adequate for individual goods contained, thereby preventing dew condensation. There have oftenbeen cases, especially in a rainy season, in which metals become oxidized, making machines defective. Therefore, cargon ships have been equipped with a large dehumidifier for removing humidity from the air in the container. This large dehumidifier is installed near the engine which serves as a power source. Dry air is supplied from the dehumidifier through a long duct to each container to adjust the humidity in it. The problems with the dehumidifiers used in applications such as this are that they are complicated in structure and large in size and take a large amount of installation cost and much space. This conventional method of dehumidification of the container carried on board a ship employs a single unit of large dehumidifier and uses a long duct to supply dry air into the containers for humidity adjustment. The adjustment control of humidity in a large number of containers require lots of manpower and working hours andOas a result, the efficiency has beenunsatisfactory.DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The dehumidifier for containers of this invention has been devised to solve the problems mentioned above.It is accordingly an object of this invention to solve these problems by providing a dehumidifier which consists of a small dehumidifier, a blower to send air from the container to the dehumidifier and a humidity sensor used to drive the blower when a prescribed humidity is reached and which is to be installed in each container. Another object of this invention is to provide a dehumidifier, equipped with a heater to remove humidity from the desiccant filled in the dehumidifier, which makes the desiccant semi permanently usable. A still further object of this invention is to provide a dehumidifier furnished with shield members which can prevent a backward current of air in the desiccator and accordingly improve the efficiency of the desiccant and also to provide a dehumidifier whose atmospheric air shield members for backward current prevention are readily detachable. As a general rule, when the suction port and the discharge port of the dehumidifier are usually opened, even if the blower is stationary and the dehumidifier has been switched off, the humidity coming from the inside walls of the container and damp atmospheric air enters through the suction port and the discharge port and is absorbed by the desiccant filled in the desiccator. In other words, it can be said that dehumidification is constantly performed to some extent even when there is no need to dehumidify the air. This results in the deteriorated efficiency and the reduced life of the desiccant.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a perspective view of the dehumidifier arranged in a container.

Fig. 4 and 5 illustrate the first embodiment of this invention, which uses shield type suction port member and discharge port member. Fig. 6 and 7 illustrate the first embodiment of dehumidifier of this invention, which uses a shield type suction port member no a discharge port member. Fig. 8 is an electric circuit diagram of the dehumidifier of this invention.THE BEST MODE OF EMBODIMENT OF THIS INVENTION Referring to the drawings, the dehumidifier for containers of this invention is described in greater detail in the following. The dehumidifier 1, used to dehumidify the air, is composed of a battery 2, a blower 3, a desiccator 4, a humidity sensor 5 and a centralized control panel 6. The dehumidifier 1, installed in a container 7, is a compact type of dehumidifier to maintain the humidity in the container 7 at a level adequate for the goods which are transported. To be more speciic, the dehumidifier is of a box shape, is provided with carrying handles la and Ib on both sides of it and is also attached with a lid lc of the battery 2, mounted to the underside of the top panel, and a lid ld of the desiccant 8. The blower 3, provided with a motor and used to draw in air from a container through the suction port and send the air into the desiccator 4, is installed in the dehumidifier. Provided near the suction port 3a of the blower 3 are a filter cloth or net 3b to filter dust and the humidity sensor 5. The desiccator 4, while letting air containing the humidity of a container pass through the desiccant 8 filled in the desiccator 4, absorbs the humidity and removes it from the air. The discharge port 4 is used to discharge or bring back the air which has been made dry by the desiccator 4 into the container. The discharge port 4 can change its position through 3600. The net 4b by which the desiccant 8 is filled consists of granular SECADO a trade name as phonetically translated or inactive ALNAGEL a trade name sa phonetically translated and is detachable. The heater 4e serves to make the desiccant 8, which absorbs the humidity of the air, permenently usable.The heater 4e is provided with a fin 4f to facilitate the dehumdification of the desiccant 8 and better radiates the heat. The centralized control panel controls the humidity in a container 7 to be at an adequate level for the goods which are transported. The control panel is used to turn the heater 4e on and off. If a certain level of humidity is preset, when the humidity in a container 7 rises to the preset level, the centralized control panel 6 detects it with the humidity sensor 5 and drives the blower 3 to decrease the humidity. Referring to Figs. 4 to 7, the examples of the atmospheric air shield are described in the following. In the examples in Figs. 4 and 5, when the blower 3 is driven, the atmospheric air around the desiccator 4 is drawn in through the suction port 3a. The drawn in air is filtered by the net 3b provided at the suction port 3a to separate dust. The air then pushes open the atmospheric air shield member 9a and is drawn into the desiccator 4. The dehumiditied air pushes open the athospheric air shield member 9b and is discharged from the discharge port 4a. When the blower 3 is stopped, the movement of air in the desiccator 4 stops. The atmospheric air shield member 9a or 9b, which has been bent pushed by the air drawn into the desiccator 4, stops receiving the pressure of air and contacts the sloped part 9c or 9d, thus closing the suction port 3a or the discharge port 4. Two pieces of plate 9e and 9f are screwed down to secure the air shield members. Therefore, the atmospheric air shields tightly contact the sloped parts by their own weight. As a result, the entry of the atmospheric air through the discharge port into the desiccator can be prevented and even the entry of a gentle breeze of some intensity can be prevented. Description is next made of the examples of the atmospheric air shield shown in Figs. 6 and 7. The shield type suction port member 11 is almost in a cylindrical form and is attached on its outside with a net to filter dust. The sloped part lla is mounted inside the suction port member 11 and has the thin film atmospheric air shield 10a fixed to it. The opening part llb of the shield type suction port member is of a quare shape and is attached on its outside with a net 12 and on its inside with an atmospheric air shield member 10a. The atmospheric air shield 10a is fixed to the upper portion of the inside of the opening part llb. The shield type suction port member 11 can be inserted into and removed from the suction port of the desiccator. Therefore, the atmospheric air shield 10a can be fitted when necessary. Fig. 7 shows a sectional view of the discharge port 4a which is attached with a 360 rotatable intermediate member 12 having a detachable shield type suction port member 13 fitted with an atmospheric shield member lOa. The intermediate member 12 is cylindrical at its bottom end engaging with the discharge port 4a so as to be able to rotate thereat and is square at the other end engaging with the shield type suction port member 13. In the shield type suction port member 13, a sloped part 13a at the opening of the member 13 is attached with an atmospheric shield member lOb in a thin film. The shield type suction port member 13 provided with the atmospheric air shield member lOb which prevent the atmospheric air from entering into the desiccator 4 can be attached to and detached from the intermediate member 12. Therefore, the member 13 can be attached to theintermediate member 12 only when it is necessary. The use of the intermediate member 12 mounted to the discharge port 4a enables the discharging direction of the dehumidified air to be charged freely through 3600.The construction of a dehumidifier for containers of this invention has been described. Next, the the connections of the electric circuit are described in detail in the following. The blower 3 is connected between a battery 2 and the centralized control panel 6. The heater 4e is connected to the centralized control panel 6. The humidity sensor 5 is connected between the battery 2 and the centralized control panel 6.The function of a dehumidifier of this invention is described in detail as follows. First, install a dehumidifier 1 in a container.The dehumidifier 1 is compact and is attached with handles la and lb, which are convenient for transportation. Then, set an optimal humidity for the goods in the container at the member of the centralized control panel 6. For example, the optimal humidity is said to be 45 to 50 for automobile parts, machine parts and metals and about 80 for cereals. When the humidity rises in a container to a preset value, 50 for example, the humidity sensor 5 detects it and the blower 3 is rotated. The air in the container is sent from the suction port 3a through the blower 3 into the desiccator 4. The humid air, as it passes through a desiccant 8, is deprived of humidity by the desiccant 8, becomes dry, and is sent back through a porous partition wall 4c and the discharge port 4a to the container 7. In this way, the air in the container is circulated and dried to an adequate humidity. When the lower limit humidity set at the centralized control panel 6, 45 for example, is reached, the blower 3 is stopped.Specifically, humidity control and dehumiditication can be performed without human intervention and the qaulity of goods can be preserved. The humidity sensor 5 is installed inside the filter cloth or net 3b at the suction port 3a located in a position remotely different from the discharge port.Therefore, the humidity sensor 5 is capable of measuring an average humidity in the container 7 and is protected from dust, external forces, etc. When the heater 4e is switched on, the desiccant 8 is heated to cause the humidity absorbed by the desiccant 8 to evaporate, making it possible to use the desiccant 8 semi permanently. The two, upper and lower, fins of the heater 4e offer a better radiation effect, facilitating the evaporation of the humidity absorbed by the desiccant 8. Since the discharge port 4a is provided above the desiccator 4, it can discharge an evaporating humidity smoothly outside desiccator 4.INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY Having the construction and the function as mentioned above,the dehumidifier for containers of this invention offers the following effects. Firstly, the installation of compact size dehumidifier incorporating a humidity sensor in a container enables the humidity in the container to be constantly maintained at a level adequate for goods which are transported. The dehumidification in a container can be performed automatically without the need for manpower, and dew condensation can thus be prevented. As a result, the quality of goods can be maintained in transit. Compact in size and attached with handles, the dehumidifier is convenient for transferring to other places. Secondly, in addition to the effects mentioned above, it is possible to provide a dehumidifier which, by the use of a finned heater in the desiccant, can evaporate the absorbed humidity efficiently and enables the desiccant to be used semi permanently. Thirdly, the installation of the atmospheric air shield prevents dehumidification from being performed when there is no necessity for doing so. The suction port member and the discharge port member both of the shield type are capable of being mounted, when necessary, to the suction port and the discharge port. This opens the way to more efficient dehumidification than ever before.
