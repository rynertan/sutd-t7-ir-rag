# Polymeric electrode coated with reaction product or organosulfur compound.

## Abstract
Conjugated backbone polymer electrodes such as polyacetylene anodes are coated with the reaction product of the reduced polymer with a sultone or sulfonate. Such coating may have occurred by using a sultone such as propane sultone in the electrolyte of a battery with such an anode, or in electrode preparation. The coating improves the stability of the electrode, especially when the polymer is highly reduced during battery use, whether the sultone remains as all or part of the electrolyte, or the sultone is replaced by a solvent such as propylene carbonate in the electrolyte for the battery containing coated electrode.
