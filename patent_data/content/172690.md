# THERMAL IMAGE SENSOR

## Abstract
A thermal image is created in a thermostatically control led liquid crystal cell 4 containing a two frequency nematic or cholesteric 3 . This is addressed with an alternating potential whose frequency can be swept through the cross over frequency. By appropriate choice of frequency within this range the thermal image is converted to a phase image which in its turn is converted to a contrast image in conventional manner.
