# INJECTION MOLDING MACHINE.

## Abstract
An injection molding machine is capable of automatical ly setting each of the parameters for injection conditions by carrying out a trial injection. By a trial injection, a period of time T₀ which is required for the drive current I₂ of a servo motor M₂ to reach a drive current value i₀ a step 123 corresponding to maximum injection pressure and injection amount C₀ are obtained a step 124 . In correspondence with the obtained time and the injection amount, the parameter values A, B and C for the injection conditions which have been stored in a memory are read out and automatically set a step 131 .
