## Description
This invention relates to a seat slide rail device for adjusting the position of a vehicle seat along the fore and aft direction, and in particular to such a seat slide rail device which comprises a pair of seat slide rail structures provided under the both sides of a vehicle seat in a mutually parallel relationship. Conventionally, seat slide rail structures of various forms have been in use for adjusting the fore and aft position of a vehicle seat, and, since the thickness of seat slide rail members has been required to be fairly great in order to assure sufficient mechanical strength and rigidity, the problems of high manufacturing cost and increased vehicle weight have been in existence. For instance, in a conventional seat slide rail structure, a lower rail consisting of a channel member having a C shaped cross section is fixedly secured to the floor surface with its open side facing upward and a slider member also consisting of a similar channel member is fixedly secured to the seat with its open side facing downward. And, the slider receives the lower rail, with rollers made of coil springs being interposed therebetween, in such a manner that the slider may be moved along the lower rail in a substantially frictionless manner. To fix the slide position of the seat, lock teeth which are pivoted to the slider are engaged with selected ones of lock holes provided in the lower rail by turning a lock lever shaft which is integrally connected to the lock teeth. GB A 2090127 on which the preamble of claim 1 is based, discloses a seat slide rail structure, comprising a lower rail having a channel member fixedly attached to a floor surface and having an open side end a slider, fixedly secured to a seat, having a vertical portion opposing the open side end of the lower rail and combined with the lower rail in an axially slidable manner by way of a bearing member and a lock member which is rotatably supported by the slider and adapted to be rotated by an actuating means. The slide position of the seat is adjustable by selective engagement of a lock tooth formed in a free end of the lock member, which is fixedly secured to the lock lever shaft, and a plurality of lock holes are provided in a lower member of the lower rail. In such a known seat slide rail structure, since both the slider and the lower rail are made of channel members having upper and lower open ends, respectively, the thickness of the channel members has to be substantially great in order to assure enough bending rigidity against the load of the seat. US A 4004772 discloses a seat slide rail structure having a lower rail consisting of a channel member having a C shaped cross section fixedly secured to a floor surface. The channel member, disposed within its web substantially vertically, is engaged by a second C shaped channel section secured to a seat. The substantially vertical disposition of the webs of the interlocking channels provides improved bending stiffness. The lock holes which are typically formed in the lower rail of conventional seat slide rail structures reduce the mechanical strength and rigidity of the lower rail, and the thickness of the lower rail must be great enough to be able to securely hold the lock teeth engaged with the lock holes. Such a lock mechanism is, in some cases, provided only in one of the two seat slide rail structures making up a seat slide rail device for one vehicle seat, but, in most cases, of the purpose of increasing the mechanical strength of the locking mechanism and the rigidity of the overall seat slide rail device, both the seat slide rail structures are provided with locking mechanisms. Typically, the lock mechanism of one of the seat slide rail structures or the master lock mechanism is driven manually by a handle, and the motion of the master lock mechanism is transmitted to the lock mechanism of the other seat slide rail structure or the slave lock mechanism by means of a wire cable and so on. In such a double lock mechanism, if a deformation causing a longitudinal displacement between the two seat slide rail structures or a diagonal deformation is developed in the seat slide rail device, the slave lock mechanism may not be able to properly lock even when the master lock mechanism is properly engaged, and the overall mechanical strength of the lock mechanism may be impaired. It is possible to have the engagement between the lock teeth and the lock holes of the slave lock mechanism a loose one so that the slave lock mechanism may achieve a full engagement at all times, a resulting play in the slave lock mechanism may produce undesirable results. Furthermore, by increasing the difference of dimensions of the widths of the lock teeth and the lock holes, the width of the lock teeth is reduced and or the width of the lock holes is increased whereby the overall mechanical strength is reduced. Alternatively or additionally, the diagonal rigidity of the seat may be increased so as to avoid any misalignment between the lock teeth and the lock holes of the slave seat slide rail structure. However, it will increase the weight of the seat and the cost of manufacture. In order to reduce the play in a seat slide mechanism DE A 3042379 discloses a conventional slide rail structure, wherein a plurality of lock teeth are formed in a free end of the lock member and at least one of the lock teeth is adapted to substantially closely fit into the lock holes while at least one other lock tooth is adapted to loosely fit into the lock holes. According to the present invention, there is provided a seat slide rail device, comprising a pair of seat slide rail structures, arranged in mutually parallel relationship between a seat and a floor along a fore and aft direction, each comprising a lower rail having a channel member with a substantially C shaped cross section fixedly attached to a floor surface and having an open side end a slider, fixedly secured to a seat, having a vertical portion opposing the open side end of the lower rail and combined with the lower rail in axially slidable manner by way of a bearing member and a lock member rotatably supported by the slider by way of a lock shaft and adapted to be rotated by an actuating means, the lock shaft of the first seat slide rail structure consisting of a lock lever shaft which may be manually rotated and to which the lock member having at least one lock tooth at its free end is fixedly secured the lock shaft of the second seat slide rail structure consisting of a lock shaft rotatably supporting the lock member having at least one lock tooth at its free end so that the lock member of the second seat slide rail structure may be actuated in synchronization with the lock member of the first seat slide rail structure by way of a displacement transmitting means so that the slide position of the seat may be adjustable by selective engagement of the lock tooth formed in the free end of the lock member with the lock holes provided in the lower rail in each of the seat slide rail structures, characterized in that Since the lower rail is made of a C channel with its open end facing sideways, it has a high bending rigidity and mechanical strength against the vertical load which the seat slide rail structure receives from the seat. The lock member is provided with a plurality of lock teeth which may be provided with tapers to assure full engagement with lock holes at all times. In particular, the lock teeth of the slave seat slide structure are preferably provided with tapers which can correct any misalignment between the lock teeth and the lock holes by being pushed into the lock holes. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the lock teeth pass through a slot formed in the slider and or a notch or hole provided in the free end of the slider extension, the mechanical strength of the lock holes are improved and the effective contact area between lock teeth or the lock member with the lock holes or the slider is increased. Preferably the lock member has a plurality of lock teeth and at least one of the lock teeth is substantially closely fitted into the lock holes while at least one other lock tooth is loosely fitted into the lock holes. Therefore, the closely fitted lock tooth effectively eliminates any play between the slider and the lower rail once the tooth is fully engaged with one of the lock holes, and the loosely fitted lock tooth assures a sufficient mechanical strength by engaging the edge of the lock hole when a great force is applied between the slider and the lower rail while the closely fitted lock tooth or the corresponding lock hole is slightly deformed. Preferably, the lock member of the slave seat slide rail structure is axially moveable along the lock shaft and is biased by a spring or a pair of springs so that any misalignment between the lock teeth and the lock holes may be accommodated by the axial displacement of the lock member along the lock shaft. In a preferred embodiment, the tapers of the lock teeth of the slave seat slide rail structure are greater than those of the lock teeth of the master seat slide rail structure so that all the lock teeth may safely fit into the corresponding lock holes even when a diagonal deformation has developed in the seat slide rail device. For a better understanding of the present invention and to show how it may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is an overall schematic side view of a master seat slide rail structure In this master seat slide rail structure A, a lower rail 1 is generally reinforced by a reinforcing member 2 and is fixedly secured to a floor by way of mounting brackets 2a and 2b which are formed at both longitudinal ends of the reinforcing member 2, while a slider 5 is fixedly secured to a seat, which is not shown in the drawings, by way of mounting brackets 5a and 5b formed at the top portions of the longitudinal ends of the slider 5. As clearly shown in Figure 2, the lower rail 1 has a generally C shaped cross section with its open side facing the slider 5 and a pair of flanges 1a and 1b extending into the open side thereof from above and below. Support members 10 having a cross section in the shape of Greek letter omega are fixedly secured to the slider 5 by rivets 13 and bearing members 11 and 12 consisting of durable synthetic resin integrally molded with the support members 10 are generally located inside the lower rail 1 in such a manner that the slider 5 may freely slide along the lower rail 1 by way the bearing members 11 and 12. A lock lever shaft 6 is rotatably supported by the bearing members 11 and 12 and extends along the central axial line of the bearing members 11 and 12. A lock member 8 is fixedly secured to a portion of the lock lever shaft 6 which opposes an opening 7 provided in the slider 5. Further, a lower portion 3 extending downwardly from the lower end of the reinforcing member 2 is provided with a row of lock holes 4 at equal intervals along the axial direction. As shown in Figure 3, the lock member 8 which is fixedly secured to the lock lever shaft 6 extends outwardly through the opening 7 of the slider 5, bends downwardly, then bends inwardly and passes through a guide slot 15 provided in a lower part of the slider 5. The free end of the lock member 8 is provided with a plurality of teeth 9 which pass through the guide slot 15, the lock holes 3 provided in the lower portion 3 and a notch 16 provided in a free end of an extension 14 of the slider 5 which is upwardly bent in an arcuate manner, thus partially surrounding the lower portion 3 in the shape of letter J and opposing two surfaces of the lower portion 3 depending from the lower rail 1. As best shown in Figures 1 and 9, a bracket 17 having a cross section in the shape of letter L is fixedly secured to the portion of the lock member 8 which extends externally of the slider 5, and another bracket 18 likewise having a cross section in the shape of letter L is fixedly secured to a lower portion of the slider 5 and extends outwardly. A pair of tension coil springs 19 are engaged between the two brackets 17 and 18. Now the action of this embodiment is described in the following with reference to Figures 1 through 4. In Figures 3 and 4, the brackets 17 and 18 and the coil springs 19 are omitted for the convenience of illustration. The lock member 8 is normally biased toward the position shown in Figure 3 in which the lock teeth 9 are engaged with the guide slot 15, the lock holes 4 and the notch 16 under the spring force of the coil springs 19. Since the lock teeth 9 engage with the lock holes 4 in this state, the slider 5 is fixed relative to the lower rail 1 or the floor surface. When the lock lever shaft 6 is turned in clockwise direction in the sense of Figures 2 and 3 by a handle 6a of the lock lever shaft 6 against the spring force of the coil springs 19, the lock teeth 9 are disengaged from the lock holes 4 as shown in Figure 4 and the slider 5 becomes freely moveable along the axial direction relative to the lower rail 1 by way of the bearing members 11 and 12. When a desired slide position is obtained, the lock lever shaft 6 is released and, by counter clockwise rotation of the lock member 8 under the spring force of the coil springs 19, the lock teeth 9 fit into the lock holes 4, thereby achieving the state shown in Figure 3 where the slider 5 is again fixed relative to the lower rail 1. According to this embodiment, since the lock lever shaft 6 is rotatably supported by the bearing members 11 and 12 in a convenient manner and, also, extends inside the lower rail 1, the overall structure is very compact. Since the distance between the lock lever shaft 6 and the lock teeth 9 is short, rotation of the lock lever shaft 6 over a relatively small angle causes the engagement and disengagement of the lock teeth 9 with and from the lock holes 4 and the adjustment of the seat slide position will be simplified. Figures 5 and 6 show another embodiment of a master seat slide rail structure according to this invention. In this case, a lower member 42 without any lock holes are securely attached to a lower part of a lower rail 41 and a slider extension 48 of a slider 44 is inwardly and upwardly bent in an arcuate manner, partially surrounding the lower member 42. Lock holes 43 are provided in a side end portion of the lower rail 41 opposite to the open side end. An upper portion of the lower member 42 adjacent to the lock holes 43 may be provided with a notch 49. A lock lever shaft 45 is provided with a fixedly secured lock member 46 which is shorter in length than the lock member 8 of the previous embodiment, and lock teeth 22 formed in a free end of the lock member 47 are adapted to fit into the lock holes 43. This embodiment has the disadvantage that the rotational angle of the lock lever shaft in locking and unlocking the lock member in the process of adjusting the seat slide position is greater than that of the previous embodiment, but has the advantages that the lock member 46 may be shorter and is therefore more advantageous in assuring sufficient mechanical strength to the lock member and there is no need for providing a hole or a notch in the lower member 42 and the lower portion portion 48, thereby giving the lower rail 41 greater mechanical strength and rigidity. Figure 7 shows a third embodiment of this invention, which is identical to the first embodiment in that a lower member 52 is provided with lock holes 53, that the lower part of a slider 54 is bent around the lower end of the lower member 52, as a slider extension 54a, in an arcuate manner with its free end provided with a notch 59, and that a lock member 57 particularly its lock teeth 58 formed on its free end may pass through a guide slot 60 provided in the slider 54, lock holes 53 provided in the lower member 52 and the notch 59 formed in the free end of the lower part of the slider 54, but differs from the first embodiment in that a lock lever shaft 56 is rotatably supported by the slider 54 by way of a bracket 55 so that the lock lever shaft 56 extends along and outside of the side end of the lower rail 51. According to this embodiment, the overall structure may not be as compact as the first embodiment since the lock lever shaft 56 is rotatably supported externally of the slider 54 and the lower rail 41, but it has the advantages that the rotational angle of the lock lever shaft 56 is small in accomplishing the slide adjustment of the seat and that the structure for supporting the lock lever shaft 56 is simpler and the manufacturing process therefore may be simplified. According to the above described embodiments, in addition to the various advantages of each of the embodiments, the bending rigidity of the overall slide rail structure is high even when the thicknesses of the members are relatively small because the heights vertical dimensions of the lower rail 1, 41 and 51 and the upper rail 5, 44 and 54 may be sufficiently great. When excessive lateral load is applied to the seat slide structure, by engagement of the curved slider extension 48 of the slider 5, 44 and 54 with the lower portion 3 and 23 or the lower member 42 and 52 securely attached to the lower rail 1, 41 and 51, sufficient mechanical strength is assured. Therefore, required rigidity and mechanical strength may be attained using members of relatively small thicknesses. Figure 8 shows a slave seat slide rail structure Namely, the lower rail 21 is generally reinforced by a reinforcing member 22 and is fixedly secured to a floor by way of mounting brackets 22a and 22b which are formed at the longitudinal ends of the reinforcing member 22, while the slider 25 is fixedly secured to a seat which is not shown in the drawings by way of mounting brackets 25a and 25b formed at the top portions of the longitudinal ends of the slider 25. As clearly shown in Figure 9, the lower rail 21 has a generally C shaped cross section with its open side facing the slider 25. A slave lock shaft 26 is rotatably supported by tabs 30 formed in the slider 25 adjacent to an opening 27 of the slider 25 and extends inside the lower rail 21 along the central axial line thereof. A lock member 28 is rotatably supported by the lock shaft 26. Further, a lower portion 23 which is integral with the lower rail 21 is provided with a row of lock holes 23 at equal intervals along the axial direction. As shown in Figure 9, the lock member 28 which is rotatably supported by the slave lock shaft 26 extends through the opening 27 of the slider 25, then bends downwardly and inwardly, and passes through a guide slot 35 provided in a lower part of the slider 25. More specifically, lock teeth 29 formed in the free end of the lock member 38 pass through the guide slot 27 formed in the slider 25, the lock holes 24 provided in the lower member 23 and a notch 36 provided in a free end of a lower portion 34 of the slider 25 which is upwardly bent in an arcuate manner, thus surrounding the lower portion of the lower member 23 in the shape of letter J and opposing both surfaces of the lower member 23. As best shown in Figure 9, a bracket 37 having a cross section in the shape of letter L is fixedly secured to the portion of the lock member 28 which extends externally of the slider 25, and another bracket 38 likewise having a cross section in the shape of letter L is fixedly secured to a lower portion of the slider 25 and extends outwardly. A pair of tension coil springs 39 are engaged between the two brackets 37 and 38. As shown in Figure 9, an end of an inner cable 42 of a control cable is connected to the lock member 8 of the master slide rail structure Therefore, when the lock lever shaft 6 of the master seat slide rail structure Figure 10 is an illustrative view showing the positional relationship between the lock teeth 9 and 29 and the corresponding lock holes 4 and 24. The master lock member 8 has five lock teeth 9a and 9b, and the widths of the frontmost and the rearmost teeth 9a are so selected that they closely fit into the lock holes 4 while the widths of the three middle teeth 9b are made smaller so that they may fit into the lock holes 4 even when there are some dimensional errors. Therefore, once the lock teeth 9a and 9b have been fitted into the lock holes 4, there is no play in the fore and aft direction on account of the foremost and rearmost teeth 9a closely fitting into the corresponding lock holes 4 and, when an excessive force is applied between the lock teeth 9 or the slider 5 and the lock holes 4 or the lower rail 1, all the five teeth 9a and 9b can engage with the peripheral portions of the lock holes 4 by deformation of the lower portion 3 or the lock holes 4 and or the slider 5 or the lock teeth 9a, and required mechanical strength will be assured. The leading edges and the trailing edges of the frontmost and the rearmost teeth 9a of the master lock member 8 are provided with tapers 48 and 49, respectively, but the tapers 49 of the trailing edges are slight as compared to those of the leading edges. The leading edges of the middle teeth 9b are provided with tapers 50 similar to the tapers 48, but the trailing edges of the middle teeth 9b are almost without any tapers. The slave lock member 28 are likewise provided with five teeth 29a and 29b, and the widths of the frontmost and the rearmost teeth 29a are so selected that they closely fit into the lock holes 24 while the three central teeth 29b are made smaller so that they may fit into the lock holes 24 defining certain gaps therebetween. Therefore, in the same manner as the master lock teeth 9, the frontmost and the rearmost teeth 29a eliminate the play in the fore and aft direction while all the five teeth 29a and 29b assure the required mechanical strength when an excessive force is applied between the lock teeth 29 or the lower rail 21 and the lock holes 24 or the upper rail 25, by deformation of mainly the lock teeth 29a. Since the leading and the trailing edges of the lock teeth 29a and 29b of the slave lock member 28 are all provided with tapers 52 and 53, even when a diagonal deformation is developed between the two seat slide rail structures, all the lock teeth 29a and 29b can safely fit into the lock holes 4 by the tapers 52 to 55 of the leading and the trailing edges of the lock teeth 19a and 19b of the slave lock member 28 engaging the peripheral portions of the lock holes 4 without fail. As a matter of fact, if the widths of the tapers 52 and 53 of the leading and the trailing edges of the teeth 29a and 29b of the slave lock member 28, as projected onto the lower rail 21, are The embodiment of Figures 9 and 10 applies to a right seat of a vehicle. In other words, the forward direction of the vehicle is indicated by an arrow 47 and the master seat slide structure is located on the inner side or the left side of the seat. This is so because the inner seat slide rail structure is more important than the outer seat slide structure in that the buckle end of a seat belt is normally attached to the inner seat slide rail structure. Therefore, the left seat of the vehicle may be provided with a structure which is symmetric to that shown in Figures 9 and 10. Thus, according to this embodiment, by selecting the tapers of the projections of the slave lock teeth to be greater than those of the master lock teeth, the slave lock teeth will be always fully locked and the mechanical strength of the lock mechanism for a vehicle seat can be simply and reliably assured. Figure 11 shows yet another embodiment of this invention which may be used as a slave seat slide structure A slider 25 is provided with an opening 27, and a shaft 26 is supported by a tab 30, which is bent inwardly after being cut out to define the opening 27, in both slidable and rotatable manner along and about the axial line of the slider 25. A slave lock member 28 is fixedly secured to the shaft 26. The range of the axial motion of the lock member 28 is determined by the two longitudinal ends 35 of a guide slot 29. A plurality of lock holes 24 are formed in a lower portion 23, which depends from a reinforcing member 23 for a lower rail 21, at equal intervals along the axial line. As best shown in Figure 12, the lock member 28 which is fixedly secured to the shaft 26 extends outwardly from the opening 27, then bends downwardly and bends inwardly, so that lock teeth 29 formed in the free end of the lock member 28 pass through the guide slot 35 formed in a lower portion of the slider 25, the lock holes 24 formed in the lower portion 23, and a notch 36 formed in a free end of a slider extension 34 which is formed by bending a lower portion of the slider 25 upwardly in the shape of letter J so as to oppose both the surfaces of the lower portion 23. A coil spring 61 is fitted over the shaft 26 and interposed between the lock member 28 and one of the tabs 30. One end of the coil spring 61 is engaged to the lock member 28 while the other end of the coil spring 61 is engaged to the tab 30. Thus, the lock member 28 is not only biased in counter clockwise direction in the sense of Figure 12 about the shaft 26 but is also biased leftwardly in the sense of Figure 11 along the axial direction. Further, a wire cable 42 is connected to a wire engagement portion 46 which is fixedly secured to the lock member 28 so that the actuating force of a lock lever shaft of a master seat slide rail structure may be transmitted to a the slave lock member 28. When a tension is applied to the wire cable 42 in this state, the lock member 28 is rotated in clockwise direction against the twisting force of the coil spring 61 and the lock teeth 29 are disengaged from the lock holes 24 and the slider 25 becomes freely slidable along the fore and aft direction relative to the lower rail 21. When a desired slide position is obtained, the tension of the wire cable 42 is released and the lock member 28 rotates towards the lower portion 23 under the twisting biasing force of the coil spring 61 with the result that the lock teeth 29 fit into different ones of the lock holes 24 and a new seat slide position is obtained. Now the action of the present embodiment is more specifically described in the following with reference to Figures 13 and 14 which schematically illustrate the relationship between the lock teeth and the lock holes. Even when there is a diagonal deformation causing a displacement As a matter of fact, if the stroke of the axial motion of the lock member 28 is There will be some play even when the lock teeth have fully fitted into the lock holes to the extent that the lock member 28 is movable along the axial direction against the spring force of the coil spring 61, but its effect is alleviated by the axial biasing force produced by the coil spring 61. Figures 15 and 16 show another embodiment of the present invention. In this case, coil springs 63 are provided on both ends of the lock member 28 and both side edges of the tips of the lock teeth 29 are provided with tapers 64. According to this embodiment, since the lock teeth 29 are always located in a substantially middle position in a free state, no matter whether the displacement According to this embodiment, a displacement in either forward or rearward direction may be absorbed and, if the angle of the tapers is the same as that of the previous embodiment in which the tapers are is provided only on one sides of the teeth, the height of the lock teeth may be reduced. In the above described embodiments, the lock members are fixedly secured to the shafts so that the sliding and rotational motion may be achieved between the shafts 26 and the tabs 30, but it is also possible to fixedly secure the shafts 26 to the tabs 30 so that the sliding and rotational motion may be achieved between the shafts 26 and the lock members 28. Alternatively, it is possible to have the lock members 28 and the shafts 26 mutually rotatable and to have the shafts and the tabs mutually slidable. The coil springs 61 and 63 produced both of the axial and the rotational biasing forces in the above described embodiments, but it is also possible to use separate springs for these two biasing forces. Thus, according to these embodiments by allowing a certain axial motion to the lock member relative to the slider and providing tapers in the lock teeth, a reliable lock becomes possible even when the alignment between the lock holes of the lower rail and the lock teeth of the slider is not favorable, and the last two embodiment are particularly effective in assuring favorable locking in a slave seat slide rail structure.
