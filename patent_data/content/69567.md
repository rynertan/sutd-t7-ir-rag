# Greatly prolonged period non interruptible power supply system.

## Abstract
A power supply system having the capability of fur nishing to a load sensitive to electrical faults and interrup tions, electrical power for prolonged periods of time after a utility or other external power supply source thereto is interrupted. The system comprises a main ac generator furnishing ac potential at a selected frequency and a selected voltage to the sensitive load, an auxiliary ac generator connected operatively thereto and a driving means for the generators energized with electricity from the external power supply source which is subject to outages and faults. The auxiliary generator generates ac potential at a much higher frequency than from the main ac generator and this higher frequency ac is supplied to a high speed ac induction motor and a flywheel unit in a sealed chamber, which unit can store large amounts of kinetic energy at full speed. Upon interrup tion of electricity from the utility or other external power source, the high speed ac induction motor in the sealed casing will function as a generator and feed back ac potential to the auxiliary generator which begins to operate as a motor and drives the main ac generator. A relatively small ac motor and flywheel unit can store and supply power to keep the main ac generator operating for from 1 to 20 minutes so as to ride out practically all reasonably expected power line outages. Particularly good results are obtained if the main ac generator is the Roesel generator of U.S. patent 4,168,459.
