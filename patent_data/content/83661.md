# LOAD SECURING TOOL.

## Abstract
A load securing tool which is used for securing large sized loads such as a large vehicle. The load securing tool, particularly the main part of the load securing tools, is designed to be reliable functionally and be easy to use, as well as have a compact structure which is highly resistant to heavy loads. In the tool of this invention, a lever 6 is not mounted directly on a body 5 , but is constructed so that the lever 6 is connected to the body 5 via a line 7 , a rotational shaft 14a connecting the link 7a to the lever 6 is moved in the direction in which the shaft 14 sinks into the body 5 when the lever 6 is turned about the body 5 so that it secures the load, thereby compactly enclosing the lever 6 in the body 5 .
