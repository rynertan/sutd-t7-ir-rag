# Quadrature tach decoder circuit.

## Abstract
A decoder for quadrature binary waveforms A,B com prises exclusive OR gates 14,24 for developing a clock signal at four times the rate of the input signals and a bistable latch 22 which responds to a signal indicating the phase sequence of the input signals. The latch is clocked by the clock signal. The indicating signal is developed by two stages of exclusive OR gates 14,16,20 including delay 18 for one input signal.
