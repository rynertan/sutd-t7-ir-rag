## Description
The present invention relates to the production of thermoplastic articles and particularly colored thermoplastic films such as those used in the manufacture of trash bags and the like. More specifically, the invention relates to improved color concentrates for use in producing colored thermoplastic articles In the production of thermoplastic colored films by conventional methods, a color concentrate containing one or more pigments is mixed together with a thermoplastic resin usually in the form of resin pellets while heating the mixture to elevated temperatures in order to melt the resin pellets and to disperse the color pigments substantially uniformly throughout the resin. An essential requirement of the color concentrate is that it must contain color pigments which are stable and which will not break down at the temperatures contemplated.This is important not only from the standpoint of maintaining good color integrity but also to prevent the occurrence of defects in the film itself. For example, yellow iron oxide Fe203.H2O is a common pigment used to produce brown or tan colored plastic film for making trash bags and the like. It looses water of hydration at about 400 F. When a thermoplastic film containing this pigment is extruded at temperatures which exceed this decomposition temperature, defects are apt to occur in the film.The defects occur mainly in the form of minute bubbles which result from the water of hydration or moisture that is liberated upon dehydration of the pigment The extent to which the defects are Likely to occur in the film can be determined by so called ash test wherein a pigment is heated to its decomposition temperature and the percent of residue or ash is then measured. Generally, if a pigment has a high percentage of ash, the losses or volatiles will be less and consequently there will be fewer defects formed in the film. Since it is sometimes desirable or necessary to extrude many of the newly developed thermoplastic resin at high temperatures, the need for improved color pigments having high decomposition temperatures as well as high percentages of ash will be evident. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide an improved method for producing colored thermoplastic articles and particularly colored thermoplastic films such as used in making trash bags and the like, wherein a thermoplastic resin is mixed together with at least one color pigment having good thermal stability and then heated to elevated temperatures to melt the resin and to uniformly disperse the pigment. Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved color concentrate containing at least one color pigment having a high decomposition temperature and an ash percentage which is greater than that of iron oxide pigments conventionally employed in the prior art. The foregoing and other related objects and advantages are attained by an improved pigment for use in the production of thermoplastic articles and particularly colored thermoplastic films which comprises manganese oxide or a material containing manganese oxide as its principle ingredient. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the pigment is employed in the form of a color concentrate containing at least about 20 50 by weight of a thermoplastic resin, the balance comprising added pigments, antioxidents and dispersing agents, for example. The manganese oxide pigment may comprise from about 10 to 70 by weight of the total color concentrate. The present invention is based upon the discovery that pure manganese oxide or a material containing predominantly manganese oxide in a finely divided or comminuated state is an ideal color pigment for use in those applications where conventional iron oxide pigments have heretofore been employed in the production of colored thermoplastic articles and particularly colored thermoplastic films. It has been found, for example, that finely divided manganese oxide when used as a color pigment exhibits basically the same color pigmentation as yellow or tan iron oxide pigments of the prior art, while at the same time the manganese oxide pigment is more stable i.e. it has a decomposition temperature of about 6000F and has an ash percentage of not less than about 99 .Consequently, when used as a color pigment to replace conventional iron oxides, extrusion temperatures can be used which are far in excess of those now commonly employed. It is desirable that the manganese oxide used as the color pigment should have a finey diviAed or com ninuted particle size. For example, the particle size of the manganese oxide used in the production of thermoplastic film should be less than about 2 microns.This is important in order to uniformly disperse the pigment throughout the resin and also to obtain the desired degree of opacity. In molding applications for making other thermoplastic articles, a larger particle size can be tolerated although it is desirable from the standpoint of opacity to employ as small a particle size as possible. Generally, a range of particle size of between about 0.1 and 5 microns is satisfactory in these applications. As indicated, the manganese oxide pigment used in the practice of the present invention may be essentially pure manganese oxide or may be a composition or material containing predominantly manganese oxide, i.e. greater than about 60 by weight. A particularly good manganese oxide containing material for use as the pigment is Mn3O fume. Mn,Od fume is produced 34 as a by product in electro metallurgical furnaces conventionally employed in the production of manganese metal. The fume is easily recovered from the exhaust of such furnaces by conventional recovery apparatus. Typically, Mn304 fume contains from about 96 to 98 by weight pure manganese oxide, the balance being a mixture which includes calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, potassium oxide and silica with less than about 1 by weight of free manganese metal. The average particle size of the fume is about 90 below 2 microns, the balance being in the range of between about 2 and 5 microns. The manganese oxide pigment of the present invention can be used with a variety of thermoplastic resins for producing colored thermoplastic articles and in particular opaque plastic films such as conventionally used in the manufacture of trash bags and the like. For instance, the pigment can be employed with polyolefin resins such as polyethylene and polypropylene, as well as polyesters, polyarnides and polysulfone. Although it is possible to add the manganese oxide pigment separately to the therscplastic resin along with other pigments, if desired, in conventional extrusion apparatus, preferably, the manganese oxide pigment is added to the base resin in the form of a color concentrate. The concentrate is preferred since the manganese oxide pigment and other additives are predispersed therein and assure a more uniform distribution of all the additives throughout the thermoplastic resin. A typical color concentrate for use with a polyethylene resin base, for example, would be as follows Weight Ingredient 49.35 Polyethylene Resin 0.15 Antioxident 30.00 Manganese Oxide Fume Pigment 20.00 Ti02 Pigment 0.5 Dispersion Agent Titanium oxide tit2 as well as other known pigments including iron oxide if desired, may be used in conjunction with the manganese oxide pigment of the present invention in various amounts in order to attain the desired tint or color. Basically, the manganese oxide pigment yields a distinctive brown or tan color which is more yellowish and darker than the standard yellow iron oxide pigment. The addition of TiO2 to the pigment tends to lighten the hasic color depending on the amount that is used.Conversely, the color of the manganese oxide pigment can be substantially darkened by the addition of carbon black which is also a known pigment in the prior art. In fact, these two pigments are used in standard tint and shade tests to determine the adaptability of a given pigment to color modification. The amount of the various pigments used in the color concentrate will depend upon the particular color or tint to be attained. Generally, the color concentrate will contain from about 10 to 70 by weight of the manganese oxide pigment, the balance being composed mostly of the basic resin and other color modifying pigments such as TiO2. The color concentrate of the present invention may also contain an antioxident such as tetrakis methylene 3 3 ,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate methane Irgonox 1010 Ciba Geigy, butylated hydroxy toluene or alkylated diphenolics. The purpose of the antioxident is to prevent degradation of the polymer at elevated temperatures. A dispersion agent may also be used in the color concentrate in order to assure that all of the pigments are uniformly dispersed throughout the concentrate and resin. A suitable dispersion agent may be, for example, aluminum tristearate. It will be evident, of course, that when other oxide pigments are employed such as TiO2, they should also have a finely divided or a comminuted particle size, preferably less than about 2 microns in the case of thermoplastic films. Also, as noted, the manganese oxide pigment of the present invention may also be used in combination with various types of iron oxide pigments, i.e. yellow or red iron oxide. However, care should be taken to determine that the particular extrusion temperatures used do not exceed the decomposition temperature of the iron oxide pigment. The shaped colored thermoplastic article made in accordance with the present invention will generally contain from about 0.1 to 20 by weIght of the manganese oxide pigment whether added directly to the mix or in the form of the color concentrate. The thermoplastic articles may be shaped by extrusion or by molding procedures well known in the art. In an example of the present invention, plastic film was extruded using a conventional extrusion apparatus and a polyethylene resin base containing finely divided manganese oxide Mn304 fume as a pigment. The pigment imparted to the film a very distinctive brown color which was yellowish and darker than standard yellow iron oxide. It was also found that the manganese oxide pigment dispersed quite readily throughout the film resin. The film was also tested for opacity. The opacity of the fiLm produced with the manganese oxide pigment was found to be slightly lower than that of film made with standard yellow iron oxide but was acceptable. The manganese oxide fume pigment was also subjected to standard ash tests wherein the pigment was fired at temperatures of about 6000F and the residue analyzed. It was found that the manganese oxide fume had an ash percent of about 99.85 which compares quite favorably to the ash percent of standard yellow iron oxide e.g. about 88 . Thus the manganese oxide pigment can be used in high temperature extrusion processes for producing thermoplastic articles or film where it has not heretofore been possible to employ other pigments, such as yellow iron oxide, which decompose at lower temperatures and yield a high percentage of volatiles e.g. water of hydration on the order of 10 15 . The manganese oxide pigment was also subjected to standard color mass tone and tint test and was found to be quite readily adaptable to color modification by the addition of other pigments such as TiO2.
