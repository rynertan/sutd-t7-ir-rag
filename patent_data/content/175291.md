## Description
In recent years, it has become clear that complex saccharides present on the surfaces of cells play essential roles in the important vital phenomena the cell surfaces take part in. Various phenomena such as immunological phenomena, inflammation, cell fusion, complement fixation, transformation into cancer cells, metastasis of cancer cells, and viral infection, are being recognized as problems with such complex saccharides on the cell surfaces, and extensive studies are proceeding on this topic. D mannose is one of the saccharides present on the cell surfaces, and an inhibitor of α D mannosidase, an enzyme hydrolyzing the saccharidal portion including α D mannosidase, is very useful in the fiel of pharmaceuticals. Swainsonine isolated from a plant of Leguminosae has been known as an inhibitor of α D mannosidase Australian J. Chem., Vol. 32, 2257 2264, 1979 . This substance has recently been isolated from Metarhizium anisoplie as well, and has been found to possess an imunomodulator action Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication 73519 84 . As mentioned above, Swainsonine inhibits α D mannosidase of the leguminous plant origin. The present inventors speculated that an inhibitor of α D mannosidase derived from a rat s epididymis might be more useful in the pharmaceutical field than an inhibitor of the enzyme of the plant origin. Based on this speculation, they made search for any inhibitors in the metabolites of microorganisms, and found that a species of actinomycetes produced an inhibitor of α D mannosidase originating from a rat s epididymis. The present inventors searched for inhibitors of α D mannosidase in the cultured broths of microorganisms. Their search led to the discovery that a strain of actinomycetes, ME3 AG3, which the Institute of Microbial Chemistry isolated in July 1973 from a soil sample collected in Kiso, Nagano Prefecture, Japan, produced an α D mannosidase inhibitor, mannostatin, having a novel structure. Microscopically, substrate mycelia were branched and extended aerial hyphae having whirls. On the aerial hyphae, no spirals were observed. Chains of mature spores included those having more than 10 spores. The spores ranged in size from about 0.4 to 0.7 x 0.8 to 1.1 microns, and their surfaces were smooth. In the following disclosure, the standards indicated in square brackets to describe colors comply with the Color Harmony Manual of the container corporation of America. The characteristics of the strain ME3 AG3 described above can be summarized as follows Furthermore, the 2,6 diaminopimelic acid contained in this strain is of the LL type. This fact considered in combination with the above mentioned properties shows this strain to belong to the genus Search on known species based on these properties has shown the strain ME3 AG3 to be closely related to Streptomyces The strain ME3 AG3 is considered to be more closely related to Therefore, The strain ME3 AG3 was deposited on October 14, 1983 with the Fermentation Research Institute, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, Ministry of International Trade and Industry of Japan under the accession number FERM P 7299. The compounds of this invention are obtained by inoculating media containing nutritional sources with spores or mycelia of the strain ME3 AG3, the strain of Streptomyces that produces those compounds, and then culturing the inocula aerobically. The nutritional sources may be any sources which are known to be utilized by actinomycetes. Examples are carbon sources such as carbohydrates, e.g. glycerol, glucose, lactose, sucrose, starch, maltose and molasses or fats and oils animal fats, and plant oils such as soybean oil, cotton seed oil or peanut oil commercially available nitrogen sources such as peptone, meat extract, corn steep liquor, cotton seed meal, peanut meal, soybean meal, yeast extract, N Z amine, casein, sodium nitrate, ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate and inorganic salts such as sodium chloride, phosphates, calcium carbonate, and magnesium sulfate. Trace amounts of metal salts may be further added if desired. They may be any materials which can be utilized by the mannostatin producing strain and which are useful for the production of mannostatin. All of materials for culture of known actinomycetes can be utilized. Fats and fatty acids are used in the biosynthesis of mannostatin, and can be utilized not only as anti foaming agents, but as carbon sources for the production of mannostatin. To mass produce mannostatin, liquid culture is preferred. The cultivation temperature may be any temperature at which the mannostatin producing microorganism is grown to produce mannostatin. The preferred temperature is 25 to 35 C. The cultivation is continued ususally until this substance is produced and accumulated in sufficient amounts in the culture broth. For instance, the cultivation is carried out as folows. A culture medium 2 glycerol, 1.5 polypeptone, 0.3 yeast extract and 0.3 CaCO₃, pH 7.2 that has been sterilized is inoculated with spores and mycelia from a slant culture of the strain ME3 AG3. The inoculated medium is shake cultured aerobically at 28 C. The accumulation of mannostatin in the medium is recognized usually after 3 to 4 days of cultivation. Mannostatin can be produced statifactorily by jar fermentation as in the case of shake culture. For example, 130 liters of a culture medium was placed in a 200 liter jar fermentor, sterilized, and inoculated with the mannostatin producing organism. Then, the inoculated medium was stirred at 200 rpm under aeration with 130 liters of sterile air per minute. The produciton of mannostatin peaked in 72 hours. The compounds of this invention are present mainly in the cultured broth of the mannostatin producing organism. These comounds are separated from the cultured broth by measures which are usually used to recover metabolites produced by microorganisms from the cultures of the microorganisms. Since the compounds of this invention are water soluble basic substances, they can be isolated, for example, by the following methods of separation and purification. The filtrate of the culture broth is poured upon a column packed with 1 volume of chromatographic activated carbon Wako Jnyaku for decolorization. The activated carbon is washed with 1.5 to 2 fold volume of 0.2M formic acid, and the washings are combined with the decolorized filtrate. The combined liquid is layered over Dowex 50W x 2 H type , and eluted with 0.5N hydrochloric acid. The eluate is adjusted to a pH of 5.0 with sodium hydroxide, and then poured upon a column packed with 1 g V of chromatographic activated carbon for adsorption. The column is eluted wiht 0.2M formic acid, and the active fractions are combined. The combined fraction is adsorbed to Dowex 50W x 8 H type , and eluted with 0.3N hydrochloric acid, thereby dividing the active fractions into two types. The active fractions to appear first are composed of mannostatin S oxide, and the active fractions to come next comprise mannostatin. The mannostatin S oxide fractions are adjusted to pH 10 with a solution of sodium carbonate, and poured upon a column packed with chromatographic activated carbon for adsorption. After washing with water, the column is eluted with 0.2M formic acid. The acitve fractions are combined, adjusted to pH 7.0 with Dowex 1 x 2 OH type , and filtered. The filtrate is layered over a column of Dowex 1 x2 that has been equilibrated with 0.05M carbonate buffer pH 10.0 , and is then eluted with the same buffer. The active fractions are combined, and poured upon a column of chromatographic acitivated carbon for adsorption. After washing with water, the column is eluted with 0.2N hydrochloric acid. The active fractions are combined, adjusted to ph 5.0 with Dowex 1 x2 OH type , and filtered. The filtrate is evaporated to dryness to obtain slightly yellow solids. The resulting mannostatin S oxide shows a single spot on high voltage paper electophoresis. The mannostatin fractions are also subjected to the same procedure, whereby slightly yellow, solid mannostatin can be obtained which shows a single spot on high voltage paper electophoresis. The physicochemical properties of mannostatin and its S oxide will be described below. These compounds are stable under neutral, acidic and basic conditions. When aqueous solutions of those compounds are allowed to stand for 48 hours at pHs of 2.0, 7.0 and 9.0, for example, the D mannosidase inhibitory activity does not lower. The two compounds are highly soluble in water, and sparingly soluble in acetone, chloroform and benzene. Both substances produce positive ninhydrin, Ehrlich and potassium permanganate reactions, and give positive reactions when heated with sodium formate and applied to a lead acetate paper. They give negative results in 2,4 dinitrophenylhydrazine test, Rydon Smith reaction, Fehling test, and Sakaguchi reaction. When both substances were thin layer chromatographed on silica gel E. Merck, West Germany and developed with n butanol acetic acid water 3 1 1 , the Rf value was 0.23 for mannostatin S oxide and 0.43 for mannostatin. On high voltage paper electrophoresis 600 V, 30 minutes using formic acid acetic acid water 25 75 900, pH 1.8 , both substances showed an Rm value of 1.07 with that of alanine being 1. Both substances are hygroscopic, but can be obtained as crystals when acetylated. Tetraacetate of mannostatin S oxide is obtained by suspending mannostatin S oxide in pyridine, and reacting the suspension at 40 C for 3 hours with the addition of acetic anhydride. Crystallization from a mixture of ethyl acetate and n hexane gives white crystals. The tetracetate had a melting point of 146 C decomp. and showed the following values on elemental analysis C 46.41 , H 5.80 , N 3.80 , S 8.87 .

Mannostatin S oxide can be converted into mannostatin, as will be easily anticipated from its structure, by adding thioglycolic acid to an aqueous solution of mannostatin S oxide, and reducing the mixture at 50 C for 30 hours. Structure determination by the present inventors has shown the compounds of this invention to be cyclopentanols having the following novel structures Assay of the compounds according to this invention is performed by measuring their α D mannosidase inhibitory activity. The activity of α D mannosidase is determined by colorimetrically measuring the amount of p nitrophenol that has been liberated when p nitrophenyl α D mannopyranoside Koch Light Laboratories, England as a substrate is hydrolyzed with α D mannosidase of the rat epididymis origin a fraction obtained by precipitation with 20 80 ammonium sulfate at the Institute of Microbial Chemistry . Details of said procedure are as follows p Nitro phenyl α D mannopyranoside is dissolved in 50 methanol to make a 0.04M solution. To 0.05 ml of the 0.04M substrate solution are added 0.25 ml of a 0.1M acetate buffer pH 4.5 and 0.15 ml of water or an aqueous solution containing the test compound. The mixture is heated at 37 C for 3 minutes, and 0.05 ml of D mannosidase is added. The α D mannosidase has been obtained as an enzyme solution by dissolving an ammonium sulfate precipitated fraction, which has been obtained from the epoididymides of 20 rats, in 45 ml of 0.02M zinc acetate, and diluting the solution with 0.02M zinc acetate to 20 to 30 times the original volume. The aforementioned mixture containing α D mannosidase is reacted at 37 C. After 20 minutes of the reaction, 2.0 ml of 0.4M glycine sodium hydroxide buffer pH 10.5 is added to terminate the reaction. The reaction mixture is measured for the absorbance A at 400 nm. Separately, the control mixture comprising only water and being free from the aforesaid test compound solution is measured for the absorbance termed b . The α D mannosidase inhibition rate is calculated from the equation b a b x 100. According to this procedure, mannostatin and its S oxide in an amount of 0.005 mcg each produced 50 inhibition IC₅₀ . The IC₅₀ was described as the concentration in 0.45 ml of the reaction mixture. The following Examples concern the recovery of mannostatin and its S oxide.

It has been also clarified that these substances stronghly inhibit α D mannosidase of the animal origin rat epididymides . Concanavalin A has been known to induce the blastogenesis of cells when adhering to the α D mannosidase portion on the surfaces of the cells. Therefore, α D mannose derivatives or inhibitors of α D mannosidase may suppress this blastogenesis, thereby impeding trasformation into cancer cells and metastases of cancer and acting on the immune system. Actually, swainsonine, the inhibitor of α D mannosidase from leguminous plants, is known to have an immunomodulator action. As noted above, mannostatin and its S oxide strongly inhibit α D mannosidase of the animal origin. Thus, they are more likely to inhibit transformation into cancer cells and cancer metastasis, and to show effects on the immune system. They are very useful in the pharmaceutical field.
