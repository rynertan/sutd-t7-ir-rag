# Semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory device comprises a plurality of memory blocks MB each including a sense amplifier array SAG and a pair of memory cell groups CG disposed on opposite side of the sense amplifier array. A row decoder RD selects a row line RL in the memory blocks. Pairs of bus lines BUS are provided, each pair corresponding to one of the sense amplifier arrays. A column decoder CD is common to the plurality of memory blocks and selectively connects a pair of input output terminals of a sense amplifier of the sense amplifier array SAG in each of the memory blocks MB to a corresponding one of the pairs of bus lines BUS .
