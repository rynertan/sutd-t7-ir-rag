# Optical compositions.

## Abstract
Non linear optical compositions contain a vinylidene fluo ride copolymer and an additive having molecular optoelectron ic activity, e.g. methyl N 2,4 dinitrophenyl alaninate. Poled films derived from the composite display optoelectronic activ ity. There is a marked contrast with known techniques in which single crystals are utilised. The compositions are used to make laminates which display good waveguide properties.
