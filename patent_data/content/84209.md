# Interior partition wall system.

## Abstract
A full height partition wall system is characterized by a unitary panel 10 with a vertically movable head panel 15 and a vertically movable foot panel 16 secured thereto and forming part thereof which can be moved upwardly and downwardly, respectively, to secure the panel 10 to and directly against a ceiling and floor, respectively. The system has no posts, rather a narrow vertical 25 on each end of the panel 10 which has an outwardly directed relatively shallow channel 26 at the top in which is positioned a strut 62 supporting the corresponding end of the head panel 15 . A drive 82 in the form of a small cog is operative vertically to move the strut 62 and thus the head panel 15 , with a spring detent member 75 holding the strut 62 in adjusted position. An adjustable foot panel 16 is secured to the bottom of each vertical 25 and the foot panel 16 is spring loaded against the bottom of the foot for movement either with the bottom of the foot or movement independent ly against the spring loading. The vertical 25 further has laterally directed edge flanges 35 flush with the open end of the channel 26 and which can be held to juxtaposed edge flanges 35 of an adjacent panel 10 to form a partition wall, and lateral access may be had to the strut drive 82 for vertical adjustment of the head panel 15 without disassem bly of the partiton wall. The panels 10 include metal face plates 19 formed with locating flanges 21 at inwardly bent vertical edges 20 thereof which co operate with lateral stops on the vertical 25 properly to position on the face plates 19 the vertical 25 forming the vertical edge of the panel 10 .
