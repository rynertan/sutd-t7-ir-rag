## Description
SPECIFICATION DATA ENTRY SYSTEM FOR NUMERICAL CONTROL EQUIPMENT TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a data entry system for NC Numerical Control equipment, and more particularly to a data entry system for numerical control equipment which is provided with a means for displaying comments on a keying procedure or the like on a display of the equipment for improvement of its operability. BACKGROUND ART In general, numerical control equipment are operated through a manual data input device a sort of keyboard provided on the front panel of the equipment, and the operating procedure is usually described in detail in an instruction manual. With recent enhancement of functions of the numerical control equipment, however, the keying procedure is now becoming more and more complex and diverse, and a single reading reading or so of the manual is not enough for correct keying operations. Especially in the case of a key entry system arranged so that an input from the keyboard is once stored in a key input buffer area and an operation corresponding to the key input is initiated by pressing of a key input execute key, the operator cannot conduct correct operations without prior knowledge of key input data for initiating an operation corresponding to each key input execute key.With the spread of numerical control equipment into various fields, it is therefore strongly demanded to make it possible for even an unskilled person to operate the equipment. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to display, on a display of the numerical control equipment, information on key input data necessary for initiating an operation cor responding to the key input execute key, permitting even a person unfamiliar with keying operations to do correct keying can conduct the operations relatively easily. Referring first to Fig. 1, the constitution of the present invention will be described in brief. Numeric, alphabetic or like data entered from key input means KEY is once stored in temporal input buffer means BUF. Comment storage means MEM has stored therein information on key input data necessary for initiating an operation corresponding to each key input execute command. Comment display means DCN reads out of the comment storage means MEM comments corresponding to the key input execute command and displays them on a display CRT in the case where the command is entered from the key input means KEY when no data is stored in the temporal input buffer means BUF.Data input processing means CNT executes processing corresponding to the key input execute command in the case where the command is entered from the key input means KEY when data is stored in the temporal input buffer means BUF.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Fig. 2 is a block diagram illustrating the principal part of an example of the hardware arrangement of NC equipment provided with adata input device embodying the present invention. Reference numeral 1 indicates a microcomputer, 2 its bus, 3 a ROM which has stored therein programs necessary for making the microcomputer 1 perform predetermined operations and comments described later, 4 a RAM having storage areas such as a temporal input buffer area 4a, a work buffer area 4b, a running information storage area 4c, a parameter setting area 4d and a tool compensation setting area 4e, 5 an address decoder, 6 a tape reader, 7 a command tape, 8 an external memory such as a magnetic bubble memory or the like, 9 a keyboard having various keys, 10 a pulse generator, 11 a CRT controller, 12 an address switching circuit, 13 an address decoder, 14 a data driver, 15 a video RAM, 16 a character generator ROM, 17 a display part such as a CRT, 19 an axis control circuit, 19 a servo amplifier and 20 a motor. AnNC command program, when given in the form of a command tape, is read by the microcomputer 1 via the tape reader 6 and when given in the form of being stored in the external memory 8, it is read directly by the microcomputer. The command program thus read is interpreted, producing running information. For ordinary NC running, the axis control circuit 18 is controlled in accordance with the running information, controlling the rotation of the motor 20 by the servo amplifier 19. Fig. 3 is a plan view illustrating, by way of example, a display part and a keyboard partof the NC equipment shown in Fig. 2. Reference numeral 30 indicates a CRT screen, 31 cursor move keys for moving a cursor K displayed on the CRT screen, 32a to 32d so called soft keys which can be used for various purposes according to software, 33 address keys for inputting an address of a sequence number or functional word, for example, GOO, 34 data keys for inputting numeric data, 35 paging keys for performing paging of the CRT screen, 36 function keys for calling a required screen, 37 a start key, 38 a key input execute key for changing a program, 39 a keyinput execute key for inserting a program, 40 a key input execute key for deleting a program, 41 a key input execute key for setting a parameter or the like, 42 a read key, 43 a punch key and 44 a reset key. Fig. 4 is an example of a flowchart showing, by way of example, the software arrangement of the data input device of the present invention. A description will be given, with reference to the drawings, of the operation of this embodiment. Incidentally, while this embodiment will hereinafter be described in donnection with a program deleting process, the present invention is not limited specifically thereto but is applicable to various processes such as alteration and insertion of a program, punching of a program on a paper tape, setting of a parameter and so forth. For example, in the case of deleting a part of theNC command program stored in the external memory 8, a first step is to operate the function keys 36 by which the NC command program desired to erase is called up onto the CRT screen 30 in a known manner, as shown in Fig. 3. Then the cursor move keys 31 are operated to move the cursor K to the beginning of the contents desired to erase. In the example shown in Fig. 3, the cursor K is positioned at the beginning of a sequence number NOd03. The next step is to specify the part desired to delete. Since there exist various modes of deletion, it is necessary to enter data suitable to a particular one of them. In this case, a person well acquainted with the method of operation needs only to follow the same method as in the past. That is, in the event that it is desired to delete only the sequence numberN0003, when the address keys 33 and the data keys 34 are operated to enter the sequence number N0003, the microcomputer 1 reads and once sotres it in the temporal input buffer area 4a of the RAM 4, after which upon pressing the key input execute kuy 40, the microcomputer 1 detects the pressing of the key input execute key and the storage of data in the iemporal input buffer area 4a S1, 52 , performing the process corresponding to the key input execute key 40 S5 , as shown in Fig. 4. That is, the microcomputer I interprets the contents stored in the temporal input buffer area 4a and deletes only the sequence number N0003 by known means.When it is desired to delete the contents of the block from the sequence number N0003 to the end of block symbol , the entire block of the sequence number N0003 is erased by pressing the key input execute key 40 after keying EOB. Further, when it is desired to erase the contents from the sequence numberN0003 to a certain word, for example, G92, or to a block of a certain sequence number, for instance, N0004, the contents desired to delete are erased by pressing the key input execute key 40 after keying G92 and N0004, respectively. A person who has no knowledge of such methods of operation or wants previous verification of them needs only to press the key input execute key 40 without entering any data. If data has been stored in the temporal input buffer area 4a of the RAM 4 at the point of time when the key input execute key 40 was pressed, as shown in Fig. 4, the microcomputer 1 reads out of the ROM 3 comments on the operation corresponding to the key concerned, that is, a program erase mode, and displays the contents of the comments at the lower portion of the CRT screen 30 S3 , as depicted in Fig. 3. In this example, WORD, EBB, 2 WORD and SEQX are displayed.Here, WORD is a comment to the effect that when it is desired to erase only one word indicated by the cursor K, the word desired to erase should be keyed xEOB is a comment to the effect that when it is desired to delete the contents from the word indicated by the cursor to the end of the block , EOB should be keyed WORD is a comment to the effect that when it is desired to delete the contents from the word indicated by the cursor to a certain word, the certain word should be keyed and 2 SEt is a comment to the effect that when it is desired to delete the contents from the word indicated by the cursor to a block of a certain sequence number N , the sequence number of the block should be keyed.Accordingly, the operator can learn the next operation to some extent from the displays thus provided. Then, when the operator presses the key input execute key 40 after keying data similar to that mentioned previously, the same processing as in the past is carried out, deleting the specified portion of the NC command program S4, S5 . That is, according to conventional key input devices, in the case where the key input execute key is pressed when no data is stored in the temporal input buffer area 4a, no processing is performed, but according to the present invention, information for keying operations is displayed on the CRT screen. Incidentally, in this embodiment, comments are displayed at the lower portion of the CRT screen corresponding to the soft keys 32a to 32d. Further, this embodiment is arranged so that when the soft keys are pressed with no data stored in the temporal input buffer area 4a, a more detailed operating procedure or comments are displayed on the CRT screen 30.For instance, when the soft key 32c corresponding to WORD is pressed, a message such as KEY IN WORD or the like is displayed. Such a message is also prestored in the ROM 3. While the present invention has been described as being applied to a system in which the key input execute keys are individually provided by hardware, the invention is also applicable, of course, to such equipment that the key input execute keys arse formed by software. That is, the present invention can also be applied to NC equipment designed so that names of a plurality of key input execute keys particular to each picture are displayed at the lower part of the CRT screen 30 and a set of soft keys can be used in common to respective pictures. As has been described above, according to the present invention, since information on key input data necessary for initiating an operation corresponding to a key input execute key is displayed on a display of the numerical control equipment, even a person who is unfamiliar with key operations can correctly operate keys relatively easily. Moreover, since the equipment can also be used in the conventional manner by pressing a key input execute key immediately after entering necessary data into the temporal input buffer means, there is no possibility of impairing the operability of equipment for those who are not well acquainted with the key operations.
