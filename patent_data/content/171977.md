## Description
PHTHALIMIDE DERIVATIVES. COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM AND A PROCESS FOR PREPARING THEN The present invention relates to a series of new nitrooxy substituted phthalimide derivatives which are useful in the treatment of ischaemic cardiac diseases1 particularly angina pectoris the invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds for the treatment of angina pectoris, and a process for preparing them. Although certain phthalimide derivatives have been described for a variety of medical uses albeit not the therapy of angina pectoris , none has so far been described having a nitrooxy substituent, as do the compounds of the present invention. Glyceryl trinitrate is widely used for the treatment of angina pectoris by sublingual administration however, oral administration of glyceryl trinitrate is of little practical use, since, although glyceryl trinitrate is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, it is extensively metabolized in the liver, which reduces its bioavailability to the extent that safe doses are of little practical value. Accordingly, glyceryl trinitrate cannot be used for the prophylaxis of anginal attacks, but can only be used to provide speedy relief from angina pectoris once its symptoms have developed. Moreover, sublingual administration of glyceryl trinitrate can, depending upon the dosage, cause an undesirably high frequency of adverse effects, including hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, reflex tachycardia, throbbing headache, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. Apart from glyceryl trinitrate, a few other nitrooxy group containing compounds have been proposed for use in the treatment of angina pectoris, including the recently proposed compound nicorandil, but, despite its disadvantages, glyceryl trinitrate is still regarded as the drug of choice in most cases for the immediate relief of the symptoms of angina pectoris. It is believed that the effectiveness of glyceryl trinitrate arises from its selective dilative effect on the collateral coronary arteries. Clearly, there is a significant need for a compound which would have a similar type of activity without the disadvantages of glyceryl trinitrate and, in particular, without affecting the heart beat. We have now discovered a series of compounds which have a selective dilative effect on the collateral coronary arteries, whilst hardly affecting heart beat, which can be administered orally and which have a long duration of activity.

The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an active ingredient in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent, wherein the active ingredient is at least one consisting of compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The invention still further provides the use of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment and prophylaxis of ischaemic heart disease, especially angina pectoris.

The most preferred compounds of the present invention are those in which A represents an ethylene group R1 is as defined above R2 represents said group of formula R 3R4N Y B O at the 3 or 4 position, preferably the 4 position R3 and R4 both represent methyl groups or R 3 andR4 both represent ethyl groups Y represents said direct bond andB represents an ethylene or trimethylene group and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. When the compounds of formula I are basic i.e. when R2 represents a group of formula R3RQN Y B O S or R3R4N CH CH R5 CH2 o , they can form acid addition salts. The acids employed to form such salts may be chosen from a virtually unlimited range, the only restriction being that, where the compounds are to be employed for pharmaceutical use, the resulting salts should be pharmaceutically acceptable which. as is well known, means that the salts should not have reduced, or unacceptably reduced, activity or increased, or unacceptably increased, toxicity as compared with the free acids. Where, however, the compounds are not intended for pharmaceutical use e.g. if tbey are intended for use as intermediates , even this restriction does not apply.Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include salts with mineral acids, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid or metaphosphoric acid and salts with organic carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, gluconic acid or benzoic acid. It will be appreciated that certain of the substituents which may be represented by A and R2 can contain asymmetric carbon atoms and, accordingly. the compounds of the invention may contain one or more such asymmetric carbon atoms and, as a result, various optical isomers and diastereoisomers may be possible. Although all of the optical isomers and mixtures of such isomers of the compounds of the invention are indicated herein by a single formula, the present invention envisages both the individual isolated isomers and mixtures which may be racemates of these isomers.Where the compounds of the invention are prepared in the form of mixtures of isomers, these may. if desired, be separated by conventional resolution techniques alternatively, they may be employed as such, as mixtures. Typical examples of compounds of the present invention are given in the following list hereafter, where appropriate, the compounds of the invention are identified by the numbers assigned to them in this list.1.

Compounds of formula I and salts thereof can be prepared by nitrating a compound of formula II EMI42.1 in which A represents a C1 C6 alkylene group or aC1 C6 alkylene group having 1 or 2 hydroxy substituents i.e. the same as A, except that it may not have a nitrooxy substituent R2 represents a hydrogen atom, a C1 C6 alkoxy group, a C1 C6 alkoxy group having 1 or 2 hydroxy substituents, a hydroxy group, a C1 C6 alkanoylamino group, a halogen atom, a group of formulaR R4N Y B O , a group of formulaR R4N CH2 CH OH CH2 O or a 2,3 epoxypropoxy group i.e. any of the groups or atoms which may be represented by Rê, except that the alkoxy group may not have a nitrooxy substituent and R5 may not be a 2 nitrooxy group, and that R2 can be a 2,3 epoxypropoxy group R3, R4, Y and B are as defined above and, if necessary, salifying the product. In this reaction, the hydroxy group attached to the group represented by A is nitrated, i.e. converted to a nitric acid ester or nitrooxy group. At the same time, depending upon the reaction conditions, one or more other hydroxy groups in the molecule of the compound of formula II may be converted to nitrooxy groups and, where R2 represents a 2,3 epoxypropoxy group, this is converted depending upon the reaction conditions either to a 2 hydroxy 3 nitrooxypropoxy group or to a 2,3 di nitrooxypropoxy group. The reagent employed for nitration may be any conventional nitrating agent, for example fuming nitric acid a mixture of fuming nitric acid with acetic anhydride or a mixture of concentrated nitric acid with concentrated sulphuric acid. The reaction may be effected in the presence or absence of a solvent. Where a solvent is employed, its nature is not critical to the invention, provided that it has no adverse effect upon the reaction. Suitable solvents which can be employed for this reaction include ethers, such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane esters of fatty acids, such as methyl acetate or ethyl acetate ketones, such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone halogenated hydrocarbons, preferably halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride or chloroform and nitriles, such as acetonitrile. The reaction is preferably effected at a relatively low temperature, for example from 300C to about ambient temperature. The time required for the reaction will vary, depending upon many factors, including the nature of the reagents and, most notably, the reaction temperature, but a period of from 5 minutes to 10 hours will normally suffice. Depending upon the reaction conditions, nitration of the benzene ring may also take place, to produce a compound of formula I in which R1 represents a nitro group. Alternatively, the nitration may be effected by first converting the compound of formula II to its corresponding halide i.e. replacing the hydroxy group or some or all of the hydroxy groups by a halogen atom or atoms and then reacting the resulting halide with silver nitrate. The conversion to the halide may be effected by conventional means employing a variety of well known halogenating agents, for example thionyl chloride, sulphuryl chloride or oxalyl chloride. The reaction of the halide with silver nitrate is preferably effected in a solvent such as acetonitrile and at a temperature of from ambient temperature to 1000C. The time required for this reaction will vary, depending upon many factors, notably the reaction temperature, but a period of from 1 to 10 hours will normally suffice. After completion of the reaction, the reaction product can be recovered from the reaction mixture by conventional means, for example by concentration under reduced pressure, filtration and extraction. It may then, if desired, be further purified by conventional means, such as the various chromatography techniques, particularly column chromatography, or recrystallization. Depending upon the reaction and recovery conditions, the resulting compound may if it is basic be obtained in the form of its nitrate. In this case, if the free base is required, this may be obtained by conventional means, by reaction with an alkali. Alternatively, the compound in the form of the free base may be salified by reaction with the chosen acid. The starting material of formula Il employed in the above reaction may be prepared by a variety of methods, the chosen method depending upon the nature of the compound of formula I which it is desired to prepare, as illustrated in the following Methods A, B and C.Method A Compounds of formula I in which Rê represents a hydrogen atom, an unsubstituted C1 C6 alkoxy group.a hydroxy group, a C1 C6 alkanoylamino group or a halogen atom, that is to say compounds of formula Ia , may be prepared as illustrated in the following reaction scheme EMI47.1 In the above formulae, A, A and R1 are as defined above and R2a represents a hydrogen atom. a C1 C6 alkoxy group, a hydroxy group, a C1 C6 alkanoylamino group or a halogen atom. Step Al of this reaction comprises an imidation reaction of the phthalic acid or derivative thereof of formula III with a primary amine of formula IV . This reaction may be carried out under conditions well known for preparing phthalimide derivatives, for example by dissolving the compounds of formulae III and IV in a suitable organic solvent and then distilling off the solvent and heating the residue. The nature of the solvent is not particularly critical, provided that it has no adverse effect on the reaction and that it can be distilled off at a temperature which does not harm the reagents or final product. Suitable solvents include alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol.The reaction temperature after distillation is preferably from 150 to 2700C. The time required for the reaction will vary, depending mainly upon the reaction temperature, but a period of from 10 minutes to 5 hours will usually suffice. Step A2 of the above reaction scheme comprises the nitration reaction already described.Method B Compounds of formula I in which R2 represents a group of formula H 3R4 N Y B O or a C1 C6 alkoxy group having one or two hydroxy and or nitrooxy substituents, that is to say compounds of formula Ib , can be prepared by the method illustrated in the following reaction scheme EMI49.1 In the above formulae, A, A , R1, R3, R4, Y 2b and B are as defined above R2b represents a group of formula R 3R4N Y B O or a C1 C6 alkoxy group having one or two hydroxy and or nitrooxy substituents R2b represents a group of formula R R4N Y B O or a 2,3 epoxypropoxy group and X represents a halogen atom, for example a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom. The reaction of the hydroxyphthalic acid of formula VI with the primary amine IV in step B1 to prepare the compound of formula VII is the same imidation reaction and is carried out under the same conditions as the reaction in step Al of Method A. In step B2 of the reaction scheme, the resulting compound of formula VII is reacted with a substituted alkyl halide of formula VIII or IX . This reaction is carried out under conditions well known for the alkylation of aromatic hydroxy compounds, by reacting the compound of formula VII with the aminosubstituted or carbamoyl substituted alkyl halide VIII or the epihalohydrin IX in the presence of a base and preferably in the presence of a solvent. Where a solvent is employed, its nature is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect upon the reaction.Suitable solvents include ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane N.N dilaethylamides of fatty acids, such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide ketones, such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone and alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol. A wide range of bases may be employed in this reaction, for example alkali metal bicarbonates, such as sodium bicarbonate or potassium bicarbonate alkali metal hydrides, such as sodium hydride alkali metal alkoxides, such as sodium methoxide or sodium ethoxide or organic bases, such as triethylamine or pyridine. The reaction will take place over a wide range of temperatures, for example from OOC to 1500C, more preferably from ambient temperature to 1100C. The time required for the reaction will vary, depending upon many factors, primarily the reaction temperature, but a period of from 30 minutes to 20 hours will normally suffice. In order to prepare compounds of formula I in which R2 represents substituted alkoxy groups other than the 2,3 dihydroxypropoxy. 2,3 dinitrooxypropoxy and 2 hydroxy 3 nitrooxypropoxy groups, the reaction in stepB2 may also be carried out employing a compound of formula Rb X in which Rb represents a C2 C6 alkyl group having 1 or 2 hydroxy substituents and X is as defined above . In step B3, the resulting compound of formula X is nitrated, as previously described, to give the desired compound of formula Ib .Method C Compounds of formula I in which R2 represents a 5 group of formula R3R4N CH2 CH R5 CH2 o , that is to say compounds of formula Ic , can be prepared by the reactions illustrated in the following reaction scheme EMI53.1 In the above formulae, R1, R3, R4, R5, A, A and X are as defined above and R represents the alcoholic part of an ester, preferably a C1 C6 alkyl group, a C1 C6 alkyl group having from 1 to 3 substituents selected from the substituents defined above1 an aralkyl group in which the aryl part is a C6 C1O carbocyclic aryl group preferably a phenyl group and the alkyl part is a C1 C6, preferablyC1 C3 alkyl group more preferably a methyl group , such an aralkyl group having from 1 to 3 of the substituents defined above, a diarylalkyl group in which each aryl part is a C6 C10 aryl preferably phenyl group and the alkyl part is a C1 C6, preferablyC1 C3 alkyl more preferably methyl group, or such a diarylalkyl group having on each aryl part from 1 to 3 of the substituents defined above. Since, however, the 6 groups represented by R are eliminated in the course of the reaction scheme, their nature is not critical and any of these or any other alcoholic ester group may be chosen. Step C1 of the reaction scheme is an identical reaction to the reaction of the compound of formula VII and the epihalohydrin IX in step B2 of Method B and takes place under the same conditions as does the reaction of step B2, to produce a compound of formula XII . This compound of formula XII is then reacted with the secondary amine of formula XIII in step C2, to give the compound of formula XIV . This reaction is preferably effected in the presence of a solvent, the nature of which is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect on the reaction. Suitable solvents include such alcohols as methanol or ethanol. The reaction will take place over a wide range of temperatures, but is preferably effected at ambient temperature or at the reflux temperature of the solvent employed, or at a temperature between these two. The time required for the reaction will vary, depending upon the reaction conditions, principally the reaction temperature, but a period of from 10 minutes to 10 hours will normally suffice. In step C3, the ester of formula XIV obtained from step C2 is converted to the corresponding acid of formula XV . This deesterification reaction may be carried out under conditions well known for this type of reaction, for example by contacting the ester of formula XIV with an acid or a base in the presence of an aqueous solvent. The nature of the acid or base employed is not critical and any such acid or base commonly used in deesterification reactions may be used, for example mineral acids, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid. sulphuric acid or phosphoric acid alkali metal hydroxides, such as potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide or alkali metal carbonates, such as sodium carbonate, or potassium carbonate.The nature of the aqueous solvent employed is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect upon the reaction.Suitable solvents include water itself and mixtures of water with organic solvents, such as alcohols for example methanol or ethanol . The reaction temperature is not critical and we normally find it convenient to carry out the reaction at about ambient temperature. The reaction of the resulting acid of formula XV with the primary amine of formula IV is identical with the reaction in step Al of Method A and may be carried out under identical conditions, to give the phthalimide derivative of formula XVI . This is then subjected in step C5 to nitration, to give the desired compound of formula Ic . At any stage during the above reactions, the reaction product can be separated from the reaction mixture by a variety of conventional means for example concentration by evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure, filtration and extraction and then, if desired. further purified by such conventional techniques as the chromatography techniques e.g. column chromatography or recrystallization. However, if desired, intermediate compounds may be employed for subsequent reactions without purification and, in some cases, without intermediate isolation. The biological activity of the compounds of the present invention is illustrated by the following tests.Selective Vasodilative Effect on Collateral Blood Vessels The test animals employed in this experiment were dogs. Each animal was anaesthetized with pentobarbital and the chest was opened to expose the heart, whilst respiration was maintained artificially. Following the method of Winburg et al. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 168, 70 95 1969 , the vascular resistance RL between two points, one at a large coronary artery on the cardiac surface and the other at a small coronary artery. was calculated by dividing the blood pressure difference between these two points by the blood flow. The peripheral resistance of the coronary artery RT was determined and the value RL was divided by the value RT, to give the selectivity RL RT . Each compound of the invention tested was administered intravenously at a dose of 30 ug kg body weight immediately prior to the measurement of vascular resistance. The same experiment was carried out employing glyceryl trinitrate at a dose of 3 g kg body weight and the results are reported in the following Table 1 as the glyceryl trinitrate ratios, i.e. the ratio between the vascular resistance of the test compound and that of glyceryl trinitrate or the selectivity of the test compound and that of glyceryl trinitrate. In all cases, these ratios were found to be greater than 1.0, indicating that, at the doses given, the compounds of the invention had a greater selectivity for the large blood vessels than glyceryl trinitrate.

The spontaneous contraction of this right atrium was recorded, whilst the test compound was added, at concentrations between 10 5 and 10 4 g ml, to the solution.In the case of glyceryl trinitrate, added at doses between 10 6 and 10 5 g ml, very little or no change in the heart beat was observed. The results, in terms of the percentage decrease or increase in the rate of heart beat, for the compounds of the invention and for glyceryl trinitrate are shown in Table 2.

The results shown in Table 2, however, indicate that the compounds of the invention will not cause such a high degree of tachycardia because they have a direct inhibitory effect on the heart rate. In the above tests, the compounds of the invention were employed at doses about 10 times the doses of glyceryl trinitrate employed for comparison. This indicates that the compounds of the invention are somewhat less active than glyceryl trinitrate. However, it also demonstrates the fewer side effects of the compounds of the invention as compared with glyceryl trinitrate. since glyceryl trinitrate could not be used at, for example, such a high dose as 30 ug kg because of severe side effects. Moreover, the compounds of the invention show a greater selectivity for the large blood vessels RL is a measure of the resistance of the large blood vessels . In the treatment of ischaemic heart diseases, the selective vasodilation of the collateral blood vessels which are represented by the large blood vessels in the above tests without affecting peripheral resistance is a most important factor. In a case where, for example, one of the coronary arteries is blocked, blood flow to the ischaemic area is supplied through the collateral blood vessels and the extent of this flow is determined by 2 factors. One of these factors is the resistance of the collateral blood vessels RL and the other is the pressure head which drives blood to the ischaemic area.If a compound dilates peripheral blood vessels whose resistance is represented by RT a the pressure head blood pressure drops and blood flow to the ischaemic area correspondingly decreases. The results given above show that the compounds of the invention have a greater selectivity for large blood vessels than for peripheral blood vessels, as compared with glyceryl trinitrate. Accordingly, they demonstrate that the compounds of the invention are likely to be more effective in the treatment of ischaemic heart disease than is glyceryl trinitrate. Thus, the compounds of the invention have a selective vasodilatory effect upon the collateral blood vessels and exhibit little undesirable effect upon the heart beat. They are, therefore, useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of ischaemic heart diseases, notably angina pectoris. For therapeutic administration, the compounds of the invention may be formulated with conventional carriers or diluents and in conventional pharmaceutical dosage forms, for example for oral administration, as tablets, capsules, powders, fine granules. granules, solutions and suspensions and for parenteral administration as injections and suppositories. The dosage employed will vary depending upon many factors, including the nature of the disorder, as well as the symptoms, age, condition and body weight of the patient and the route of administration. For oral administration to an adult human patient, a suitable daily dosage would be from 0.2 mg to 200 mg, more preferably from 15 mg to 60 mg, which may be administered in a single dose or in divided doses.For non oral administration, the preferred dose would be from 0.1 mg to 20 mg, more preferably from 2 mg to 6 mg, daily in a single dose.

EXAMPLE 4N 2 Nitrooxyethyl 4 2 hydroxy 3 propylaminopropoxy phthalimide Compound No. 196 a 10.2 g of potassium carbonate were added to a mixture of 10.5 g 0.05 mole of dimethyl 4 hydroxyphthalate, 20.6 g 0.15 mole of epibromohydrin and 300 ml of acetone, and the mixture was heated under reflux for 8 hours. with stirring. The reaction mixture was then allowed to stand overnight, and the potassium bromide formed was filtered off. The filtrate was concentrated by evaporation under reduced pressure, and then 150 ml of water were added to the residue, which was extracted with ethyl acetate. The extract was washed, in turn, with a 5 w v aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide and with water, and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate.The solvent was distilled off to leave an oil, which was then purified by column chromatography through silica gel, eluted with a 1 1 by volume mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane, to give 6.1 g of dimethyl 4 2,3 epoxypropoxy phthalate in the form of an oil. b A mixture of 2.7 g 0.01 mole of dimethyl 4 2,3 epoxypropoxy phthalate prepared as described in step a above , 0.6 g 0.01 mole of propylamine and 20 ml of methanol was heated under reflux, with stirring, for 2 hours. The solvent was then removed by evaporation under reduced pressure, and 15 ml of water were added to the residue, which was then extracted with ethyl acetate. The extract was vigorously shaken with 30 ml of 1N hydrochloric acid, and the aqueous phase was separated, made alkaline by the addition of potassium carbonate. and then extracted with ethyl acetate. The extract was dried and the solvent was distilled off to leave an oil which was subjected to column chromatography through silica gel and eluted with ethanol to give crystals. These crystals were recrystallized from a mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane to give 1.2 g of dimethyl 4 2 hydroxy 3 propylaminopropoxy phthalate as crystals melting at 58 590C. c A mixture of 0.98 g 3 mmole of dimethyl 4 2 hydroxy 3 propylaminopropoxy phthalate prepared as described in step b above , 19.8 ml of a 1N aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide and 20 ml of ethanol was allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. 19.8 ml of 1N hydrochloric acid were then added to the reaction mixture and the solvent was distilled off. The residue was treated twice, each time with 50 ml of ethanol, and then water was removed by evaporation under reduced pressure. 30 ml of methanol were added to the residue, and the insolubles were filtered off. The methanol was distilled off under reduced pressure to give 1.0 g of 4 2 hydroxy 3 propylaminopropoxy phthalic acid in the form of a powder, which was then used for the next step without purification. d 5.94 g 0.02 mole of 4 2 hydroxy 3 propylaminopropoxy phthalic acid prepared as described in step c and 1.22 g 0.02 mole of ethanolamine were dissolved in 250 ml of methanol, which was then distilled off under reduced pressure. The residue was heated on an oil bath kept at 200 205 C for 2 hours. At the end of this time, the reaction mixture was dissolved in 30 ml of water and then extracted five times, each time with 200 ml of ethyl acetate. The combined extracts were dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, and the ethyl acetate was distilled off under reduced pressure to give 1.9 g of N 2 hydroxyethyl 4 t2 hydroxy 3 propylaminopropoxy phthalimide in the form of a powder melting at 104 1070C.
