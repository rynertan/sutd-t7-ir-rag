# Process for preparing carbonated liquids.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of carbonated beverages by the consumer is disclosed. Water is contacted with carbo nated ice and, optionally, flavored syrup in a closed pressure vessel whereby superatmospheric pressure is created and a carbonated liquid is produced. Soft drinks prepared by this method have a degree of carbonation substantially the same as the bottled or canned product available commercially.
