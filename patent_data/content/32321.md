# Tiled roofs.

## Abstract
A plurality of battens 30 35 are arranged in parallel spaced relationship along the roof and spaced apart by less than half a tile length. Roofing tiles 5 are hung on the bat tens in staggered columns. Each moulded concrete roofing tile has a roll portion 11 a flat portion 10 , a batten engag ing nib 14 on the underside of the flat portion adjacent the upper end of the tile and a cut away portion 25 of the free edge of the roll portion the cut away portion also extending from the upper edge of the tile. The tiles of first alternate columns are hung by their nibs 14 from first alternate bat tens 30,31,32 and the tiles of second alternate columns are hung by their nibs from second alternate battens 33,34,35 . Thus, the tiles in adjacent columns are staggered with respect to one another, a part of each tile being received in the cut away portion of an adjacent tile in an adjacent col umn.

## Description
TILED ROOFS The invention relates to tiled roofs and provides a tiled roof comprising a plurality of battens arranged along the roof in parallel relation and spaced apart by less than half a tile length and a plurality of roofing tiles, each tile comprising a roll portion a batten engaging nib on the underside of the tile adjacent the upper end of the tile and a cut away portion of the free edge of the roll portion of the tile, the cut away portion extending from the said upper end of the tile, in which the tiles in first alternate columns of the tiles up the roof are hung by their nibs from respective first alternate battens and the tiles in second alternate columns of tiles are hung by their nibs from second alternate battens, the arrangement being such that tiles in adjacent columns are staggered with respect to one another, a part of each tile other than end tiles of rows being received in the cut away portion of an adjacent tile in an adjacent column. Preferably all the tiles other than at the edges of the roof are substantially identical. Preferably each tile has a flat portion and a roll portion in side by side relation, a part of the flat portion being received in the cut away portion of an adjacent tile. The flat portion of each tile may have an upturned edge. Further features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description, by way of example, of a preferred embodiment of a roof structure according to the invention the description being read with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a plan view of a roofing tile for use in the invention Figure 2 is an underplan of the tile of Figure 1 Figure 3 is an end view of the tile in the direction of arrow 3 in Figure 1 Figure 4 is a section along the line 4 4 ofFigure 2 Figure 5 is a section along the line 5 5 ofFigure 2 Figure 6 is a side view of the tile in the direction of arrow 6 in Figure 1 Figure 7 is a plan view of a roof according to the invention and including a number of tiles as shown in Figures 1 to 6 Figure 8 is a section along the line 8 8 inFigure 7, and Figure 9 is a scrap view looking in the direction of arrow 9 in Figure 8. Referring to the drawings, and first toFigures 1 to 6, a moulded concrete roofing tile 5 comprises a flat portion 10 and a roll portion 11.The flat portion 10 is provided with an upturned edge 12. On its underside see Figure 2 the tile is provided with a projecting nib 14 which is formed on the flat portion 10 of the tile and is adjacent one end of the tile. The tile may be hung from a batten by means of the nib 14. The underside of the tile is also provided with projecting ribs 16, 17 and 18 which extend across the flat portion 10 of the tile and with further ribs 19, 20, 21 and 22 which extend across the underside of the roll portion 11 pf the tile. All these ribs give the tile strength and rigidity and also prevent capillary flow of water from one til to another adjacent aligned tile in known manner. The roll portion 11 of the tile is cut away at 25 to provide a profiled edge 26 for a purpose which will be described below. Trough tiles not illustrated and short tiles approximately half the length of a tile 5 and also not illustrated may be provided to complete the roof structure and will be designed to co operate with the tiles 5. The construction of a roof embodying the tiles of Figures 1 to 6 will now be described with reference to Figures 7, 8 and 9. The frame work of the roof 29 is constructed including a number of first battens 30, 31, 32 which are spaced apart in the usual way by the length of the tiles 5 minus the required overlap between tiles in the same column. Second battens 33, 34, 35 are also fixed to the rafters not shown parallel to the battens and spaced mid way between the first battens. The tiles are then hung as follows. A vertical column of trough tiles not shown in Figure 12 is first hung in mutually overlapping relation up the roof at the right hand edge of the roof. Next, a vertical column of basic tiles 5 is hung on the first battens 30, 31, 32. A short tile 60 is hung on batten 30 with its roll portion 11 resting in the lowermost trough tile 70. A basic tile 5 is then hung from batten 31 using nib 14, overlapping the trough tiles and the short tile 60. The rest of the vertical column of basic tiles 5 is then hung in similar fashion progressing up the roof. An adjacent vertical column of basic tiles 50 is then hung on the second battens 33, 34, 35 the lowermost tile of the row being hung by nib 14 from batten 33 and the remaining tiles 5 being hung from battens 34, 35 etc. by nibs 14. In this way, te two rows of tiles 5 are staggered in relation to one another, the stagger being half the length of the exposed portion of a tile. Further rows of tiles 5 are then hung in similar fashion until the roof is completed, first alternate columns being hung from the first alternate battens 30, 31, 32 and second alternate columns being hung from the second alternate battens 33, 34, 35. As will be appreciated from Figure 7, the cut away portions 25 of the roll portions 11 of the tiles 5 receive part of the flat portions 10 of tiles 5 which are diagonally adjacent up the roof and the length of the cut away portion corresponds to the spacing between adjacent battens 30, 33 etc. for this purpose. It will also be noted that the upturned edges 12 of the tiles prevent lateral flow of water into the spaces between the tiles. It will further be appreciated that the doublebattening arrangement described above allows the construction of a roof with staggered tiles using only identical tiles throughout except at the edges of the roof . A roof as described above simulates a roof made from the sort of clay tiles which are commonly found in Southern Frace where the clay tiles are laid in staggered formation. In this way it is possible to form a roof having all the advantages of moulded concrete tiles yet having a traditional appearance. The invention is not limited to the preferred embodiment described above and various modifications may be made. For example, in practice, the roof may be tiled not by hanging complete vertical rows of tiles as described, but by hanging a few tiles of a first vertical column, then a few of the second column and the third column and then returning to the first column. It will be appreciated that while this hanging sequence is the same in principle as that described it requires less moving across the roof on the part of the tiler.
