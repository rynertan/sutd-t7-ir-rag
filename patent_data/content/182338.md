Be tween these cup shaped element an essentially spherical or semi spherical elastic body 24 of rubber or an equiv alent material is sandwiched. In alternative embodiments of the invention the lower cup shaped element 26 is dispens ed with by the elastic body 24 or 24 directly resting on a shaped portion of the underhung U bracket 38 or 40 , which performs the same function as the eliminated lower cup shaped element 26 . The cup shaped elements 26, 28 are formed so as to control the shape of the elastic body 24 during its compression to obtain a progressive spring char acteristic both in the vertical and in the lateral direction.

## Description
Suspension device in a bogie for a railbound vehicleThe invention relates to a suspension device in a bogie for a railbound vehicle according to the precharacterising part of claim 1.For transportation of very heavy goods by railway, multiaxled freight cars are usually required in which the axles are journalled in bogies at either end of the car for taking up, inter alia, angular rotations which arise when the car runs through curves.One problem in connection with freight cars of the above kind is that their ride properties vary considerably with the load carried by the car. In many cases, the suspension devices in the bogies are dimensioned according to a conceived normal maximum load on the car to give it good ride properties. Such suspension devices may, for example, consist of a set of helical steel springs which are clamped between a bottom beam of the side frame and the end of the bolster beam. However, because these springs have a linear spring characteristic, the suspension is very rigid in relation to the weight of the car in an unloaded state. This leads to several problems. First of all, the risk of derailment during unloaded operations increases because of this spring stiffness.For example, in the case of a twist in the track, as occurs when the car enters a superelevated curve, where the outer rail rises relative to the inner rail, the inner wheels on the front bogie tend to lift from the inner rail. Furthermore, the linear spring characteristic gives rise to poor ride properties in the car during unloaded operations, caused by a high natural frequency in the vertical and lateral directions, which results in an unfavourable socalled ride index, which is measured from oscillations and vibrations in the car.One further disadvantage with the linear spring characteristic is that so called bottoming may occur, meaning that the spring is loaded to such an extent by dynamic forces that any further loading of the spring is abruptly blocked.This may occur when a fully loaded car passes over a track irregularity in the vertical direction, for example when the car rolls over a hollow or a short elevation in a rail. This may cause the suspension system to become incapable of absorbing the great dynamic loads which arise, resulting in the supporting parts of the bogie and the car body having to absorb heavy dynamic forces directly when the springs bottom against a fixed stop. This limits the maximally allowed speed in the case of normal standard of track, since the freight would otherwise be subjected to excessive acceleration forces and jerks in the case of bottoming.To eliminate some of the above mentioned problems, proposals have previously been made to use a two stage suspension, that is, a suspension unit which has soft springs operating when no load is carried and where stiffer springs dimensioned for the maximum permissible load start to operate when the load exceeds a certain value. However, such a car will have poor ride properties under certain load conditions, such as, for example, when the car is partially loaded so that the stiffer springs are just about to start operating. Springs of a progressive type, i.e. having a progressively increasing stiffness with increasing load, have also been developed to provide a more optimum stiffness with regard to the load in question. An example of such a spring is the socalled hour glass spring, which consists of a steel plate sandwiched rubber body resembling an hour glass. This type of spring may ensure the optimum stiffness in the vertical direction but has the disadvantage of being pliable in the lateral direction. For this reason, such springs are not well suited for freight cars but have found their primary use in lighter cars for passenger traffic which are not subjected to such heavy loads and changes in load as freight cars. Furthermore, hour glass springs are difficult, and hence expensive, to manufacture and are also relatively space demanding.The invention aims at a suspension device in a bogie for a railbound vehicle of the above mentioned kind in which the disadvantages of the known suspension devices are eliminated and whose stiffness in the vertical direction increases progressively as an approximately exponential function with the load, while the stiffness in the lateral direction may be caused to be considerably greater than in case of the socalled hour glass spring in order to capture the dynamic lateral movements of the car without going against the stops when entering curves or when running over major laterally effective track irregularities.The invention further aims at providing a suspension unit of the afore mentioned kind which has a simple design, is inexpensive to manufacture, and exhibits a difference as small as possible between the static and the dynamic stiffness of the springs. In addition, the spring units are to be well suited for combination with friction wedge dampers. To achieve this aim the invention suggests a suspension device in a bogie for a railbound vehicle according to the introductory part of claim 1, which is characterized by the features of the characterizing part of claim 1.Further developments of the invention are characterized by the features of the additional claims.In the suspension device according to the invention the suspension unit comprises an essentially spherical or semispherical elastic body of rubber or other equivalent material. A cup shaped element, on which vertical and lateral forces originating from the bolster beam are intended to act, makes contact with the upper side of the elastic body.The lower side of the elastic body rests against the bottom part of the side frame, which can also be cup shaped or otherwise shaped. These cup shaped elements are designed to control the shape of the elastic body during its compression to obtain the desired progressive load dependent spring characteristic both in the vertical and in the lateral direction.The optimum shape of the surface making contact with the elastic element is a conical or a truncated conical one. In this way the shape of the elastic body is altered during its compression such as to achieve the desired spring characteristic.The elastic body may have an essentially semi spherical shape, with its largely plane face making contact with an essentially plane upper side of the bottom part of the side frame. The elastic body may also have a concave part on its substantially plane bottom face, which fits onto a corresponding convexity on the upper side of bottom part of the side frame. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the elastic body is essentially fully spherical, the lower side of which rest against the bottom part of the side frame over a cup shaped element which, in the same way as the cupshaped element making contact with the upper side of the elastic body, is designed to control the shape and hence the spring characteristic of the elastic body in both the vertical and lateral directions.The invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings showing inFigure 1 a perspective, partially exploded view of a bogie for a railway car, comprising a suspension unit according to the invention Figure 2 a schematic side view of the suspension unit according to the invention under empty load condi tion Figure 3 a corresponding view of the suspension unit when the railway car is fully loaded Figure 4 an alternative embodiment of the spring element in a suspension unit according to the invention Figure 5 a further embodiment of the spring element in a suspension unit according to the invention. Figure 1 illustrates a bogie which is intended to support one end of the body of a railbound freight car. The bogie is built up of two parallel side frames 10, at the end portions of which a pair of axles 12 are rotatably journalled by means of journals 14. A spring element 16 of rubber is inserted between the side frame 10 and the respective journal 14 and forms a conventional primary suspension unit which is stiff in the vertical direction but has such a static stiffness in the longitudinal direction that the desired radial self steering properties and low flange wear are obtained when running through curves. Furthermore, this primary suspension design gives such a dynamic stiffness in the longitudinal and the transverse direction that a high speed can be achieved on straight stretches without oscillations occurring in the wheel sets of the bogie.The side frames 10, which are internally connected by means of a transverse structure not shown ,each have an upper beam 18 and an underhung U bracket 20 extending downwards from said upper beam and supporting a secondary suspension unit 22 according to the invention. The suspension unit 22 consists of an elastic body 24 of rubber or an equivalent material, which in the unloaded state is essentially spherical or ball shaped and is supported by a cup shaped shapecontrolling element 26 mounted in the bottom of the Ubracket 20. On top of the elastic body 24 rests a similar cup shaped shape controlling element 28 which is assembled to transmit vertical and lateral forces from a transversely extending bogie bolster beam 30, which is articulately connected, by way of a center plate, to the car body not shown .The articulation between the bolster beam and side frames is achieved by means of a friction type damping device consisting of wedges 32 and rubber plates 34. This damping device is the subject matter of an EP application entitled Damping device in a bogie for a railbound vehicle , filed simultaneously which the present application by the same Applicant.As seen more closely in Figure 2, the inner sides 36 of the cup shaped elements 26 and 28 facing the elastic body 24 have a truncated conical shape, the conicity being so formed as to obtain a progressive spring characteristic in the vertical direction, exhibiting an essentially exponentially increasing stiffness with increasing load. The conical inside may then be formed in such a way that its inclination towards the horizontal plane in a direction outwards towards the periphery of the cup shaped element is decreased in a continuous or stepless manner along a portion or the entirety of the radial length of the cup shaped element. Figure 2 and 3 show such a stepless decrease of the inclination towards the horizontal plane in the portion neighbouring the outer periphery of the cup shaped element.Because of the substantially spherical shape of the elastic body 24 and the special embodiment of the faces of the cupshaped elements 26,28 which hold the elastic body 24, a substantially exponential spring characteristic is obtained in the vertical direction.Figure 2 shows schematically the form of the secondary suspension unit 22 during empty load condition, whereas Figure 3 shows the same suspension unit under full load condition, where the conical sides 36 of the elements 26,28 determine the shape of the compressed elastic body 24, and thus the spring stiffness, in the desired manner.The embodiment of the elastic body 24 also results in improved stiffness in the lateral direction because of the relatively large shear area of the body. Figure 4 shows schematically an embodiment of the suspension unit in which the elastic body 24 is essentially in the form of a semisphere resting with its plane surface directly on the plane upper side of the bottom part 38 of the side frame. The lower side of the semi spherical elastic body 24 , as shown in Figure 5, may be formed with an indentation which mates with a corresponding elevation on the bottom part 40 of the side frame. The overall height of the side frame can thus be reduced.In combination with a suitably formed damping device of a friction type, the suspension device invented will ensure good riding properties in the car over straight stretches and in curves, irrespective of whether the car is empty or fully loaded and irrespective of whether track irregularities such as elevations or cavities occur in the rails.
