# HANDLING AND OR PROCESSING OF CONTINUOUS, MOVING WEB AND METHOD OF AND APPARATUS FOR WINDING UP AND EMBOSSING SUCH WEB

## Abstract
A wind up mechanism 10 comprises a driven wind up drum 12 having a perforated outer surface 24. A web 34 to be wound up passes around the drum onto a core 22 where it is wound up to form a reel. The core is freely rotatable on a turret 16. A cylinder 20 urges the reel against the drum 12 so that rotation of the drum causes rotation of the reel. The interior of the drum is divided by partitioning into a pressure chamber 28 connected to the delivery of a pump 32, and a suction chamber 30 connected to the suction of the pump. Suction tends to increase frictional adherence of the web to the drum in the region of the suction chamber 30, whereas pressure tends to assist separation of the web from the drum in the region of the pressure chamber 28. A new method of cutting the web and changing over from a completed reel to a new core is also disclosed. Furthermore, an embossing apparatus is disclosed in which a perforated drum such as the drum 12 is used to strip the web from the embosser roller by applying suction to the web to suck it away from the embosser roller.
