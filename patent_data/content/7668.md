# The manufacture of a group of infra red detector elements, and a group so manufactured.

## Abstract
A group of infra red radiation detector elements are manufactured from a body 21 of infra red sensitive materials on an insulating substrate 22 using two masking steps which do not require critical alignment eeven with close spacing between the elements. A first masking layer 24 see Figure 10 e.g. of photoresist is formed on the upper surface of at least the body 21 to determine by a lift off technique a metal lization pattern 35, 36 on the body 21 and the substrate 22 . A second masking layer 44 e.g. of photoresist is then provided to determine by ion bombardment through windows 45 of this layer 44 the desired pattern of elements and their electrodes. The ion bombardment permits removal of exposed areas of not just the body 21 and metallization pattern 35, 36 but also of a passivating layer on the body surfaces a closely spaced group of elements and their elec trodes can be obtained because the ion bombardment results in steep sides without significant undercutting. It is suggested that Figure 14 should accompany the Abs tract when published.
