# Coil manufacturing apparatus.

## Abstract
A coil manufacturing apparatus comprises a mandrel wire 10 , guide means 12 for guiding the mandrel wire in its longitudinal movement, coiling means 16 guiding a filament wire while revolving around the mandrel wire to coil the filament wire around the mandrel wire, and transfer means 18 for moving the mandrel wire along the longitudinal direction thereof. The transfer means includes holding means 36 to hold only the mandrel wire and driving means for moving the holding means along the longitudinal direction from a first position to a second posi tion which is farther from the guide means than the first position is.
