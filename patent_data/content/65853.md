# Penile prosthesis with improved fluid control.

## Abstract
A surgically implantable prosthesis for the treatment of penile erectile impotence in male patients. The device comprises at least one elongated cylinder 1 implanted within one of the corpora cavernosa of the penis. The flexible, distal end 2 of the cylinder is adapted to rigidize upon being filled with pressurizing fluid. The rear tip or proximal end 4 of the cylinder is formed to provide a chamber 12 which serves as a fluid reservoir. Valve means 14, 15, 16 contained within the flexible, distal end section of the cylinder, for conveniently accessible manual manipula tion is utilized to selectively control fluid flow between the a rear tip reservoir and the distal end of the cylinder. The prosthesis further includes a manually operable pump means 4, 46 utilized to transfer pressurized fluid from the rear tip reservoir to the distal end of the cylinder in order to achieve an erection. The walls of the rear tip reservoir itself may serve as the pump means, or a separate pump 68 may be implanted within the scrotum.
