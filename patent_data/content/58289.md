## Description
Arpangsment for the automatic orientation of an antenna in a radio receiver or television set by means of a te leo control The present invention relates to an arrangement for the automatic orientation of an antenna in a radio receiver or television set.Although the invention can be applied also to radio receivers, it lends itself particularly to the use in television sets and therefore it will be described by way of example in connection with television sets.The reception of a number of television transmitters by means of signals from different directions requires oft n the use of several antennas with different orientation or as an alternative of an antenna orientable by means of a servo control. In the wide spread case of the use of a non centralized antenna the user must search, at any channel change, for the most suitable orientation for the signal reception.The performances of the present day television sets provided with a telecontrol for channel change, are therefore partly limited by the requirement that the orientation of the antenna must be changed frequently when a channel change is effected, which operation has been made nanually up to now.The present invention aims to obviate such a disadvantage.More particularly, the arrangement for the automatic orientation of an antenna according to the invention is characterized in that it comprises a telecontrol transmitter and a circuitry inside the apparatus provided with an orientable antenna, consisting of a receiver for the signals emitted by the telecontrol, a decoder and a digital analog converter whose output is connected to a servo control for the orientation of the antenna.The digital analog converter supplies a variable voltage to each value of which an angular position of the antenna can be associated. The obtainable angular resolution depends on the cell bit number of the register used.The antenna can be either an outdoor antenna equiped with a servo control or an antenna incorporated in the radio receiver or television set.According to a feature of the invention, for the positioning of the antenna one of the proportional controls volume change, contrast control, etc. of the same telecontrol can be used advantageously.According to another feature of the invention, the rotation of the antenna can be remotely controlled to associate to each channel the most suitable orientation of the antenna and this orientation is stored for each channel so that at any subsequent channel change the antenna moves automatically in the right position previously fixed once and for all.These and other features of the invention will be better apparent from the following detailed description, given mere ly by way of example and therefore in no limiting sense, of an embodiment thereof, referring to the accompanying drawing, whose single figure shows diagrammatically an arrangement according to the invention. Srom said figure there is seen that in a telecontrol trans mitter 1, in addition to the keys 2 intended for the channel change and the keys for the adjustment of the various parameters of the television set, the keys 3 and 4 have been incorporate for the left hand and right hand rotation of the antenna in order to search, for each channel, for the orientation giving an optimal reception. The storage key 5, normally already present to associate to each program key a channel according to the users choice, has in this case also the function of associating to each channel the optimal orientation of the antenna previously chosen by the user by means of the keys 3 and 4.The signals transmitted by the telecontrol are received and amplified by the amplifier 6 and sent to the decoder 7 which, in addition to supplying the usual signals for controlling the various parameters of the television set, is connected both to a random access memory RA 13 by means of a data addressing bus 8 and writing and read out control lines 9 and 10 respectively and to a six or more bit register 14 by means of increment and decrement signal lines 11 and 12 respectively. In addition, the line 10, while acting for the read out signals for RAM 13 acts simultaneously as writing signal for the register 14.The register 14 is connected to a digital analog converter 16 by means of a data bus 15 and to the memory 13 by means of the bidirectional data bus 17.From the converter 1 A 16 an analog signal 18 goes out whose value determines the angular position, and thus the orientation,of the antenna 20 by means of the servo control 19.In order to understand the operation of the arrangement, let us examine hereinafter the various modes of use a Control of the left hand and right hand rotation of the antenna by means of the nush buttons 3 and 4 to search for the optimal orientation of the antenna for the reception channel chosen by means of one of the keys 2.When choosing a channel, by means of one of the keys 2, there goes out through the bus 8 from the decoder a predetermined address for the memory 13 which, through the bus 21, tunes the television set on the desired channel by means of the circuits 22. Simultaneously, the random data present in the memory cell corresponding to the requested channel, are transferred through the bidirectional bus 17 to the register 14 by means of a timed control applied on the line 10. Once this control has ceased, the output from the memory 13 changes to the high impedance condition and does not influence the contents of the register 14 any longer.The antenna will have taken in the meantime a random position if no specific data has been previously stored and therefore requires a manual adjustment. In this case, by acting on the control keys 3 and 4, the corresponding signals radiated by the telecontrol 1, amplified by 6 and decoded by 7 arrive to the register 14 by means of the lines 11 and 12 and cause a gradual increment or decrement with respect to the existing digital value.The corresponding digital data pass from the register to the converter D A 16 through the data bus 15. From the converter B A an analog signal 18 goes out which, through the servo control 19, rotates the antenna in a real time rightwards and leftwards corresponding to the controls given by means of the keys 3 and 4. b Storage of the angular position of the antenna and its association to the channel being received.If, after having chosen a signal by means of one of the keys 2 and having searched for the angular position of the antenna for best reception of the signal by means of the keys 3 and 4, the storage control 5 is pushed down, the corresponding signal, received by 6 and decoded by 7, enables, through the line 9, the memory REM 13 to store the data existing on the register 14 corresponding to the angular position of the antenna and present on the bidirectional bus 17. These data are stored in the memory cell relating to the memory address imposed by the bus 8 and corresponding to the channel being received.c Call for the channel on which an angular position of the antenna has been previously stored.In this case by calling for the channel by means of one of the keys 2 the desired signal, amplified by 6 and decoded by 7, supplies the memory with the read out control of the memory ciall corresponding to the address communicated by means of 8.In this memory cell, in addition to the data corresponding to the channel called for,which tune the television set through the bus 21, there are now also the data relating to the optimal angular position of the antenna. These data are transferred through the bus 17 in the register 14 and from it they pass to the converter D A 16 through the bus 15 and there appears on 18 the analog signal for the control of the servo control 19. While but one embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, it is obvious that a number of changes and modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention. In particular the present invention can be used also in combination with the arrangement for the remote change over of two or more antenna terminals of a television set, disclosed in the applicant s Italian patent applicationNo.19580 A 80 of January 31, 1980 so as to control, in addition to the antenna change over, also the positioning of the antenna with the possibility of storing both controls for each channel.
