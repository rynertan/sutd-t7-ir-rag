# GENERATION OF SULPHUR TRIOXIDE FROM OLEUM

## Abstract
A continuous process for the generation of sulphur tri oxide from oleum suitable for use in the sulphonation of organic compounds which comprises continuously introducing oleum feed to a sulphur trioxide desorption tower continuously in troducing a dry feed air stream comprising recycled dry feed air stream to the desorption tower, whereby a gaseous mixture of sulphur trioxide in air is produced collecting spent oleum from the desorption tower introducing the gaseous mixture to a sulphonation reactor and recycling spent gaseous mixture from the reactor to the desorption tower as recycled feed air. The process offers reduced environmental pollution and operating costs.
