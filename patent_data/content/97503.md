# Process for preparing a lithographic printing plate.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a support for lithographic printing plate having an electrodeposited chromium layer on an iron material, characterized in that the surface of said electrode posited layer has a shape in which crystalline products with angles protrude thereon, the elemental composition in the surface side portion of said electrodeposited layer consists substantially of chromium and oxygen and the ratios of atomic concentrations of chromium and oxygen at said portion are substantially even at the same depth from every point on said surface.
