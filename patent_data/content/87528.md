# Position sensing device.

## Abstract
A position sensing device 10 for indicating the relative position of the device with respect to an external surface. A main support member 16 houses a plurality of angular position sensing probes 106, 108 which are each associated with transducers 114, 118 that provide an indication of the relative position of each probe 106, 108 to the support member 16 so that when the probes 106, 108 engage an external surface, information is provided which can be used to indicate the relative position of the device with respect to external surface. An additional lateral position sensing probe 44 can also be mounted in the support member 16 to indicate exact axial alignment with a hole or other discontinuity in the external surface.
