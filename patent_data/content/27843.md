# Method and apparatus for protecting an electric motor.

## Abstract
A transmitter 21 is coupled to the motor 10 and to the power lines 16, 17, 18 for generating pulses on the power lines in certain circumstances such as during an overheated motor condition. A control unit 39 is coupled to the power lines and senses the pulses and monitors the power current magnitude in the lines. The unit compares the current level with previously established upper and lower limits. If the current is outside the limits for a preset length of time, a fault condition exists and the motor is turned off for a length of time that depends upon the severity of the fault. The unit 39 also turns off the motor upon the receipt of pulses from the transmitter when a certain number of pulses regularly recur. The unit in cludes indicators 48 52 for displaying the nature of the fault. The unit may be adjusted for automatic operation wherein it will turn the motor on again after a time interval, for manual operation wherein the motor can only be restarted manually.
