# LENS GRINDING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A lens grinding apparatus comprising edge thickness measuring means for, in a photoelectrical and non contact manner, measuring the edge thickness of the lens to be ground after completion of rough grinding, and a computing means for computing a predetermined position of the lens edge as a dis tance value from a predetermined movable origin in the direc tion of the axis of the lens shaft of the carriage on the basis of the data on the edge thickness obtained from the edge thick ness measuring means, characterized in that the carriage is ar ranged to be capable of moving downwardly such that a pre determined position of the line of the edge surface of the lens agrees with the groove bottom of the V shaped groove when bevel grinding is performed.
