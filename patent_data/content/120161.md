# Pouches.

## Abstract
A pouch 10 comprises two opposed webs 12, 14 hav ing respective side and bottom portions 16, 18, 20 sealed together thereby leaving an unsealed end 22 whereat one 12 of the opposed webs extends beyond the free edge 24 of the other 14 of the opposed webs to form a flap 26 . The flap 26 is foldable onto over an edge portion of the other web. An area of pressure sensitive adhesive 28 , which is disposed on the flap 26 , extends through a position for normal folding of the flap 26 , so that the flap 26 is foldable within the area covered by the adhesive to bring that latter into direct sealing contact at the flap fold. The flap 26 is foldable along a rupturable portion 30 which extends across the width of the flap 26 . The relatively readily rupturable portion 30 , which defines a fold line 32 , comprises a perforated line of weakness or a scored line of weakness.
