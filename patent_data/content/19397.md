# Process for making textured yarn.

## Abstract
A filament yarn 2 of greater than 60 per cent extensibility is combined with a carrier yarn 1 . The combined yarn 8 is false twisted under tension in a unit employing rotary friction elements 11 so that the filaments of the extensible yarn break intermittently while the carrier yarn remains intact to produce a spun like textured yarn. The tension during false twisting may be increased to a level at which the broken filaments snarl and form slubs in the yarn. The process may be carried out with no heat setting 10 of the false twist to form crimps. Suitable extensible yarns include undrawn and partially orientated yarns, polyamide and polyester yarns, and suitable yarns include fully drawn filament yarns and spun yarns.
