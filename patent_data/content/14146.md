# Control valve device for pneumatically operated servomotors.

## Abstract
A control valve device for a pneumatically operated ser vomotor with two chambers separated by a movable wall, said valve device controlling the fluid communication be tween said chambers and between one of them and a source of fluid under pressure so as to establish a pressure differen tial across said movable wall in response to an input force The valve device according to the invention includes a plunger 70 which moves from a rest position to a working position under the action of the input force, a resilient disc 60 with a normally opened passage 62 therethrough which gets sealed when said disc is compressed by the plunger, and a resilient membran 88 with normally closed slits 94 there in which get open when said membran is stretched by the plunger as the latter moves For use primarily in power brake boosters for automotive vehicles.
