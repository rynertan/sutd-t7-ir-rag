# Improving compound semiconductor crystal by heat treatment and crystals improved thereby.

## Abstract
The quality of a compound semiconductor crystal such as gallium arsenide used for an integrated circuit is upgraded by a method comprising optionally forming a protective film on the obverse surface and reverse surface of a substrate consisting of a compound semiconductor crystal, subjecting the substrate to a heat treatment in an inert atmosphere at a temperature of at least same as the activating temperature after ion implantation into the substrate and then optionally removing the protective film.
