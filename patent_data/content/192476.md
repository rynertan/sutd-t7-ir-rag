# Brush seal manufacture.

## Abstract
An apparatus for use in the manufacture of brush seals which comprise a plurality of filaments of brush material sandwiched between two sideplates. The apparatus com prises a workplate onto which is mounted one of the sideplates of the seal. A plurality of first clamping members clamp against the sideplate. Each member can be lifted to enable a tuft of brush material to be inserted and clamped against the sideplate. To enable more than one layer of tufts to be built up on the sideplate a second clamping means is provided to enable the first clamping members to be released. An indexing mechanism allows the first clamping members to be moved relative to the clamped tufts and when the assembly of tufts is complete a second sideplate is clamped onto the tufts and first sideplate. The apparatus also includes means for cutting a pre wound ribbon of adhesively bonded wires into short lengths to form the tufts.
