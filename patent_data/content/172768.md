# Magnetic brush development device for an electrophotographic copier apparatus.

## Abstract
The invention concerns toning means for use in an electrostatic copying machine 10 which includes a rotary magnetic brush 148 journalled for rotation on an axis 150 parallel to the arcuate area of an electrophoto graphic member 250 and capable of having a toner layer applied to at least a portion of the circumference of the brush 148 and brought into engagement with said electrophoto graphic member 250 at said area, a hopper 138 adapted to carry a quantity of toner 146 , a cylindrical formation 142 connected to the bottom of the hopper 138 spaced from and encompassing all but a segment of the volume occupied by said brush 148 , the hopper 138 having a wall which provides a bottom edge 144 spaced from the surface of said brush to form a metering blade adjacent said segment, the segment extending from said blade to the electrophoto graphic member 250 and means provided to rotate the brush 148 in a direction where a layer of toner will be metered onto said brush 148 and thereafter be carried through said segment into engagement with said elec trophotographic member 250 .
