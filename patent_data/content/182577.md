# OPTICAL FIBER CONTACT

## Abstract
An assembly for interconnecting a plurality of first con tacts disposed in a ribbon array with a plurality of second con tacts, also disposed in a ribbon array, includes a plurality of cylindrical radial springs which are split longitudinally along an axial direction of the contacts, each radial spring providing three common lines of contact with the mating first and second contacts so as to precisely align front ends of mating the first and second contacts. The assembly further includes dynamic seals on opposite ends of an alignment insert which contains the cylindrical, radial springs, the dynamic seals preventing for eign matter from entering an interface between front ends of the mating first and second contacts, and also functioning to dampen shock and vibration induced displacements of the mating first and second contacts.
