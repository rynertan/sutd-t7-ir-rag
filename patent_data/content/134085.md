# DNA encoding a GRF precursor.

## Abstract
mRNAs encoding for GRF sequences are identified in a pancreas tumor and sequenced. From the sequence, it is learned that hpGRF is initially a portion of a longer precursor peptide that is subsequently processed into hpGRF. cDNA made from such mRNA is transformed into a host cell which produces a GRF precursor. In vitro or in vivo processing can be used to obtain GRF from the precursor.

## Description
DNA ENCODING A GRF PRECURSOREMI1.1 The present invention relates to aLpeptide, designated preproGRF, which is an unprocessed precursor of human growth hormone releasing factor GRF , DNA which encodes preproGRF and the production of preproGRF and GRF using recombinant DNA technology. Several important hormones are produced in the mammalian hypothalamus and in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, one important hormone being growth hormone GH which promotes mammalian growth. It has been established that release of growth hormone by the pituitary is subject to regulations by a hypothalamic peptide. It has been known for some time that a hypothalamic peptide, somatostatin, inhibits release ofGH. The concept has been well established that a substance produced in the hypothalamus, referred to asGRF or somatocrinin, is the counterpart of somatostatin, promoting the release of GH from the pituitary. Although GRF is generally associated with the hypothalamus, it may be produced by other cells, such as pancreatic tumor cells. In fact, the first peptide having GRF activity that was fully characterized was obtained from a human pancreatic islet tumor, Guillemin et al. Science 218 pp. 585 587 1982 . It is believed that human pancreatic GRF is identical to human hypothalamic GRF, although this has not been conclusively shown. In any case, pancreatic GRF is highly effective in promoting release of growth hormone, and in view of its potential for regulating human growth, it would be highly desirable to be able to obtain human pancreatic GRF in substantial quantities. The GRF characterized by Guillemin et al. has 44 amino acid residues and is amidated at its carboxyl end. A form of GRF having only 40 amino acid residues has also been reported, and fragments of GRF having as few as about 27 amino acid residues have been found to be biologically active, although less effective than the 44 amino acid residue peptide. The full 44 amino acid residue pancreatic GRF peptide has been synthesized chemically, and synthetic GRF, synthetic GRF fragments, and synthetic analogs thereof represent a potential source of highly potent regulatory substances, however, chemical synthesis of such long peptide chains is quite expensive. Recombinant DNA techniques by which human GRFDNA is introduced into a cell to express GRF is believed to represent the best hope of inexpensively producingGRF. One method of obtaining DNA which encodes GRF is to read the genetic code in reverse and synthesize an oligodeoxynucleotide which should encode the GRF amino acid sequence. Such synthetic genes or DNA have indeed been designed. Attempts to introduce such synthetic genes into cells have not yet resulted in transformants which produce significant amounts of GRF. Superior results in gene expression obtained using recombinant DNA technology are frequently obtained if DNA isolated from natural sources is used instead of oligodeoxynucleotides synthesized according to a nucleotide sequence deduced from the amino acid sequence. One reason for this My be that, although the genetic code is redundant in that several codons a defined sequence of three successive nucleotides generally encode a single amino acid, the natural nucleotide sequence may be superior to a random selection of apparently appropriate codons. Furthersore, it is frequently observed that a natural gene does not only encode the observed peptide, but rather encodes a precursor which contains the putative signal and other cryptic and coding sequences which undergo and or direct obligate processing steps necessary for the production of the mature and active peptide. This invention is directed to the isolation of the mRNA encoding GRF and its application to produce GRF through recombinant DNA techniques. As described more fully hereinafter, mRNA has been isolated encoding precursors of GRF which include the entire 44 amino acid residue sequence of human pancreatic GRF as well as flanking sequences at the carboxyl terminus and amino terminus of GRF. Starting with RNA obtained from a humanGRF producing pancreatic tumor, cDNA was generated by reverse transcription, and cDNA clones encoding GRF precursors were identified from a cDNA library.Sequencing of these cDNA clones disclosed that they encoded two closely related precursors of human GRF.Each GRF precursor includes the entire 44 amino acid sequence of human pancreatic GRF as well as processing signals for directing conversion of the precursors toGRF, including amidation of its carboxyl terminus. The cDNA clones have been used to transform cells and have been shown to direct synthesis of the GRF precursors in the transformed cells. Where processing enzymes are present in the transformed cells, the precursor is converted to GRF. In accordance with the present invention, the search for the human growth hormone releasing factor preprohormone has led to the isolation and sequencing of genes that encode two precursors of human panceatic growth hormone releasing factor hpGRF . Human pancreatic hormone releasing factor is a forty four amino acid residue peptide, and is designated hpGRF 44.Based upon biological, immunological and physico chemical evidence, hpGRF 44 is identical to human hypothalamic growth hormone releasing factor hhGRF . one of the two cDNAs encodes a precursor having 107 amino acid residues, designated preproGRF 107, and the other encodes a precursor having 108 amino acid residues, designated preproGRF 108. The preproGRFs each contain the entire amino acid sequence of hpGRF in addition to peptide fragments linked to both the amino terminus and carboxyl terminus. Each terminal peptide contains basic processing sites which direct their removal by enzymatic action. Amidation of the carboxyl terminus of mature GRF is directed by theGly Arg sequence in the carboxyl terminal peptide. Isolation of messenger RNA mRNA from a human pancreatic tumor which has very high human pancreatic growth hormone releasing factor activity is first accomplished, and then cDNA is synthesized from the mRNA by reverse transcription. The cDNA was annealed to plasmids which were transformed into E. coli cells, and the cells were cultured as individual colonies, creating a cDNA library. From the cDNA library, colonies of cells transformed with cDNA encoding peptides that contain hpGRF sequences were selected by hybridization screening using oligodeoxynucleotides synthesized to correspond to portions of the GRF amino acid sequence.The cDNA of the hybridization positive clones were excised from the plasmid DNA and sequenced, and the nucleotide sequence revealed that the GRF amino acid sequence is derived from a portion of a larger precursor protein that is designated preproGRF. The isolated cDNAs also include noncoding segments at their 3 and 5 ends. The isolated cDNAs, when appropriately inserted into controlling DNA segments, direct synthesis of preproGRE in transformed cells. From transformed cell lines that lack the preproGRF processing enzymes, preproGRF containing polypeptides are isolated and purified. Cell lines having the preproGRF processing enzymes, when transformed with hybrid genes containing the foreign preproGRF cDNA, produce additional GRF. The invention will now be described in greater detail by way of example. Isolation and sequencing of preproGRF encoding mRNA is aided by the availability of a pancreatic tumor described in Guillemin et al. supra, having high intrinsic pancreatic growth hormone releasing activity. 3 ug Poly At RNA are obtained from 15 g of the tumor stored in liquid nitrogen or at 800C using the guanidine thiocyanate procedure of Chirgwin et al.,Biochemistry 18 5294 5294 1979 and chromatography on oligo dT cellulose, Norgard et al., J. Biol. Chem. 225, 7665 7672 1980 . From the 3 ug of Poly A RNA, 1 ug of double stranded cDNA is synthesized using a modification of Gubler et al. manuscript in preparation of the Okayama et al. method, Mol. CellBiol. 2 161 170 1982 . The cDNA is used to construct a cDNA library.Using a modification of the method of Peacock et al.,Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 655, 243 250 1981 . The cDNA is tailed with poly dGTP and annealed to EcoRV cut pBR322 plasmid tailed with poly dCTP. The chimeric plasmids are then transformed into E. coli RR1, and the transformed cells are plated, providing 300,000 independent trans formant s. The colonies are then screened to locate colonies containing cDNA which include nucleotide sequences corresponding to the predicted nucleotide sequence of fractions of genes that encode hpGRF sequences. Oligodeoxynucleotides are synthesized which are predicted to be complementary to a segment of the natural GRF gene, and these oligodeoxynucleotides are used as hybridization probes for colony screening. Two mixed nucleotide probe pools are synthesized by the solid phase phosphotriester method of Miyoshi et al.,Nucleic Acids Res. 8, 5507 5517 1980 and labeled at their 5 ends with 32P ATP according to the method ofMaxam et al., in Methods in Enzymology, eds. Grossman et al. Vol. 65, pp. 499 560, Academic Press, New York 1980 .One of the mixed oligodeoxynucleotide probes, designated probe A, is 20 bases long and corresponds to amino acid residues 1 7 of the hpGRF sequence 1 7 H Tyr Ala Asp Ala Ile Phe Thr 5 ATG CGN CTG A CGN TAT G A AAA TG 3 . The other mixed probe B is 14 bases long and corresponds to amino acid residues 35 39 of bGRF. 35 39 Asn Gln Glu Arg Gly 5 TTA G GTT C CTT C GCN or TCT C CC 3 The tetradecamer probe B is initially used for colony screening by the method of Hanahan et al. Gene 10, 63 67 1978 . Hybridizations are performed in a buffer comprised of 0.75 sodium chloride, 0.075 M sodium citrate, 0.1 sodium dodecylsulfate, partially hydrolyzed yeast RNA 100 ug ml , 0.28 bovine serum albumin BSA , 0.2 polyvinylpyrrolidone and 0.2 ficoll at 30 C for 2 hr using 1 pmole of labeled probe per ml.The filters are quickly rinsed in a solution of 0.3 M sodium chloride, 0.03 M citrate, at room temperature, and following a high stringency wash in a solution of 0.6 M sodium chloride, 0.06 M sodium citrate for 60 min.at 40 C, the filters are exposed to X ray film overnight. High and low density screening of 11,000 cDNA clones with probe B reveals that the inserted DNA fragments of nine of these clones hybridize to probe B.Southern blot analysis shows that the inserts of seven of these nine recombinants also hybridize to probe A. The plasmid DNAs of the transformants that hybridize to both probe A and probe B are linearized with Hind III and subjected to partial sequencing by the chain termination method of Smith, Methods of Enzymology 65 pp.560 580, using probe B as a primer. Four clones encoding hpGRF sequences are thereby identified of which clone no. 21 contains the largest cDNA insert 520 bp . The cDNA insert of clone no. 21 is fully sequenced by the method of Maxam et al. supra, and its sequence is. shown in the Table below.

In the hpGRF reading frame, the presumed initiator and terminator codons are located 31 and 32 codons upstream and downstream, respectively, from the hpGRF 44 coding sequence. Therefore, this cDNA encodes a preproGRF that is 107 amino acids long and has the typical characteristics of a preprohormone. Steiner et al., Annals of New York Acad. of Sci., 243 1 16 1980 . To confirm that the amino acid sequence of preproGRF that is deduced from the sequenced cDNA fragment in fact corresponds to the actual gene product and is not an artifact of reverse transcription, mRNA obtained from the pancreatic tumor cell is used to generate translation products, and the molecular weight of the translation product is compared with the molecular weight of the predicted preproGRF product.Translation of hpGRF 44 mRNA is carried out in the cell free rabbit reticulocyte system. The products are immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody raised against synthetically produced GRF and then are separated by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. The largest translation product runs as a doublet with a molecular weight of about 13,000 that agrees well with the size of preproGRF 107 predicted from the nucleotide sequence of clone no. 21 MW 12,361 . A smaller translation product also runs as a doublet MW 8000 and, like the larger product, is reactive with GRF specific antibody. The low molecular weight product may represent premature translational terminations or a low level of processing of the larger peptide.The reason for the appearance of doublet bands is unclear. These results demonstrate that the nucleotide sequence is correct and that the cDNA fragment of clone 21 contains the entire preproGRF 44 coding region. Having confirmed that clone no. 21 containtWe entire coding sequence for preproGRF 44, it is now possible to use the recombinant segment to locate hpGRF 44 messenger RNA from poly A RNA. Using nick translated plasmid DNA from clone no. 21 as a hybridization probe for Northern blot analysis of poly A RNA, a prominent band corresponding to a messenger RNA of approximately 820 nucleotides is detected. Because recombinant no. 21 contains a complete 3 noncoding region and the poly A tract.it appears that the 520bp cDNA segment transformed into clone no. 21 does not contain the entire 5 noncoding region of the preproGRF message. Having ascertained that clone no. 21 contains an inserted DNA gene segment corresponding to the entireGRF 44 coding region, the cDNA from this clone provides longer and more specific hybridization probes useful for locating clones containing similar DNA segments. The original cDNA library is rescreened with a probe derived from the 5 end of the cDNA insert of clone no. 21 nucleotides no. 82 149 , with respect to the Table. One clone, no. 8, contains a DNA insert segment 40 nucleotides longer at the 5 end, an additional trinucleotide in the coding region, and an additional tetranucleotide in the 3 non coding region. As can be seen in the Table, the trinucleotide encodes an additional serine, residue 103, of the 108 amino acid residue peptide, preproGRF 108. Of four additional clones analyzed, three contain the nucleotide sequence encoding preproGRF 108, and one contains the sequence encoding preproGRF 107, confirming the presence of at least two different hpGRF mRNA s. Indications are that the DNA segment in clone 8 is a substantially complete preproGRF cDNA, representing reverse transcription of substantially all of a GRF 44 messenger RNA. Further indications are that a minor portion of hpGRF mRNA may be about 80 nucleotides longer. Having established the primary structures of two cDNAs encoding preproGRF 107 and 108, some observations are made about its structure. The first 20 amino acid residues underlined in the Table of preproGRF 107 and of preproGRF 108 constitute the putative hydrophobic signal peptide that is joined to proGRF, 87 88 amino acids in length. ProGRF 87 and proGRF 88 contain processing sites boxed in the Table for enzymatic generation of hpGRF 44, i.e., two arginine residues 30 31 preceding the amino terminus and a single arginine residue 77 immediately following the carboxyl terminus. The sequence Gly Arg 76 77 immediately following the carboxyl terminus leucine of hpGRF 44 is consistent with a signal for amidation of the mature product. The cDNA segments obtained from the hybridization positive clones of the cDNA library are useful for introduction into either eukaryotic or prokaryotic host cells for the purpose of GRF expression.Plasmid DNA is obtained from each of clones 21 and 8.The plasmid is cut with Hind III endonuclease to expose the 5 end of the inserted cDNA fragment. The 5 sequences of preproGRF may be digested with Bal 31 exonuclease in order to generate a series of DNA segments which include variable lengths of amino terminal sequences for use in a variety of expression vectors. For example. for use in gtll or pCQV2 it will be necessary to remove all sequences 5 to the initiation codon for preproGRF. Chemically synthesized oligonucleotides will be then added to 5 end of the digested DNA segment according to the specification of the vectors in order to optimize the production of either a hybrid or fusion gene product for maximal levels of expression of pure preproGRF, proGRF or theGRF proteins.Linkers will be annealed to the 3 terminus after subsequent recloning of the digested DNA segment , and the final engineered fragments can be digested with appropriate endonucleases and isolated from the larger plasmid DNA by polyacrylamide or agarose gel electrophoresis. Each of the processed cDNA segments is annealed into the appropriate restriction site of an expression vector, such as gtll Young andDavis, Proc. Natl. Acad. of Sci. 80, 1194 1198 , pCQV2 Queen, C., J. Mol. and Appl. Genetics 2 1 10, 1983 , pMB9 derived vectors, Roberts, et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 76, 760 764, 1979 , or pBR322 derived vectors Jay et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 78, 5543 5548, 1981 .The recombinant expression vector is introduced into E.coli RR1 by the method of Peacock et al. supra.Bacterial colonies containing the preproGRF related cDNA segments are selected by DNA hybridization with probe B or by antibody screening Young Davis supra. , and 50 hybridization positive colonies containing each of the preproGRF genes are selected for further culturing. The correct structure of the putative cDNA vector is confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis. In order to examine bacterial colonies for production of preproGRF related peptides directed by the bacterial expression vector in E. coli, the presence ofGRF protein sequences in the colonies is determined by radioimmunoassay. Cell lysates are prepared, bound to polyvinyl chloride microtiter wells, exposed toGRF specific antibody, and antibody antigen complex is quantitated by further binding of 1251 labeled ProteinA by the method described by Kohler, G. Y., in HybridomaTechniques, Cold Spring Harbor Lab., Cold Spring Harbor,N.Y. 1980. Identification of GRF peptide sequences in the lysate of some of the seven preproGRF 107 colonies and some of the twelve preproGRF 108 colonies indicates that the cDNA s express their respective protein products in these colonies. A colony of E. coli transformed with preproGRF107 related genes and producing reasonable amounts of peptide that is reactive with an appropriate specific antibody is selected for further culturing, as is a colony of E. coli likewise transformed with preproGRF 108 related genes. Lysates are prepared from each of the colonies, and each lysate is fractionated by exclusion chromatography followed by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels. Exclusion chromatography fractions which contain proteins with molecular weights in the 12,000 to 13,000 range are purified by affinity chromatography on columns of Sepharose beads coupled with anti GRF antibodies, and or by ion exchange chromatography, all of which purification methods are generally known in the art. Final purification may be obtained by high pressure liquid chromatography Guillemin, et al. supra . The quantity of the respective preproGRFs in the recovered fractions are estimated by radioimmunoassays in which GRF reactive antiserum is first incubated with various dilutions of the fractions and then exposed to 125I labeled synthetic GRF 44.The concentrations of preproGRF in the various dilutions is calculated by comparing the concentrations of antibody bound and unbound labeled GRF with standard curves derived from controls, in which the GRF antiserum is initially exposed to known concentrations of unlabeled GRF and then to known concentrations of labeled GRF. The results indicate that the purified fractions each contain preproGRF in the range of about 75 to about 80 percent of the total protein. Although neither of the two forms of unprocessed preproGRF or hybrid proteins containing bacterial sequences as well as GRF sequences have been shown to have GRF activity, these substances nevertheless represent valuable compounds. It may well prove to be the case that, if the precursors are administered to an animal, the precursor will subsequently be processed in vivo into GRF. In any case, preproGRF may be processed in vitro by exposing the preproGRF to a human hypothalamic extract containing processing enzymes. It is likely that a hypothalamic extract from a non human species can be found which processes human preproGRF to GRF. Either in vivo or in vitro enzymatic processing of preproGRF would be expected to amidate the terminal carboxyl group of GRF 44.This is a distinct advantage of the natural gene over a synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide which encodes only the GRF amino acid sequence without the processing sequences found in preproGRF. The processing may also proceed on partially purified fractions which are thereafter purified as described above. In the cases where a hybrid protein containing bacterial sequences at the amino terminus is the product of bacterial expression, partial hydrolysis with a reagent, such as cyanogen bromide, may be necessary to release the preproGRF for further processing in vitro by the tissue extracts. The preproGRF gene fragments engineered for expression in bacteria can also be used for expression in eukaryotic systems, either in yeast or mammalian cells. In the case of yeast, mammalian interferons were found to be properly secreted and processed when expressed using a yeast vector, YEplPT Hitzeman et al.Science, 219, 620 625, 1983 . PreproGRF may be similarly processed and secreted, which would aid in the purification process, the preproGRF may then serve as a substrate for in vitro processing, as described above.Alternatively, the cDNA segments found to code for preproGRF can also be introduced into a human hypothalamic cell line or a rat pituitary cell line where enzymes are available for processing preproGRF 107 and preproGRF 108. The cDNA can be cloned into such expression vector as the pSV2 family of SV40 derived vectors Mulligan, R. C. and Berg, P. in EukaryoticViral Vectors, Y. Gluzman, ed. Cold Spring Harbor Lab.,Cold Spring Harbor, NY. or into the newer retroviral vectors, Mulligan, P., Science 209 1422 1427 1980 . The cDNA can then be delivered into the hypothalamic cells by microinjection, DNA transfection, or viral infection. Cells that stably integrate the introduced cDNA can be selected by a selection protocol for either gpt or neo, the 2 dominant markers provided by the vector system. GRF production by the colonies would be assayed by the general method described above using appropriate antibodies. Several of the colonies should produce GRF at levels well above the level of GRF produced by the non transformed cell lines. Thus, the isolated preproGRF cDNA is considered suitable for transformation into eukaryotic host cells, and the product expressed will, in at least some instances, be processed into GRF by enzymes within the host cell in the normal manner. While the invention has been described in terms of certain preferred embodiments, modifications obvious to one with ordinary skill in the art may be made without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, it is understood that the preproGRF cDNAs described herein represent only the precise structure of two naturally occurring gene segments. It is expected that slightly modified alleles will be found encoding for similarly functioning proteins, and such gene segments and proteins are considered to be equivalents for the purpose of this invention. It is also known that slightly modified homologs of the proteins could be synthesized and that many such modified homologs would be expected to exhibit preproGRF activity, and these are likewise considered within the scope of the invention. DNA having equivalent codons is considered within the scope of the invention, as are synthetic gene segments that encode homologous peptides that exhibit preproGRF activity.
