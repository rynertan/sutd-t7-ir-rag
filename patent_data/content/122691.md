## Description
BIDIRECTIONAL CRYOGENIC VALVES This invention relates to a sealing means for bidirectional cryogenic valves and, more particularly, to cryogenic and special fluid handling valves having improved sealing means capable of use at all temperatures from cryogenic to extreme fire temperatures. The present invention is directed to valve structures of the type disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,260,496, and which valve principally utilizes a unilateral sealing means. A bidirectional cryogenic valve structure is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,650,508 granted on March 21, 1972. These patented structures are particularly adapted for controlling the flow of cryogenic fluids, including liquid and gaseous hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and methane, as well as many other ambient temperature bipropellants and corrosive fluids. The sealing means utilized in such cyrogenic valves provided virtually leakproof action.The sealing means principally utilized in these valve structures are constructed entirely of resilient plastic materials, such as Teflon or the like, and are subject to being destroyed by fire conditions at the valve thereby rendering the valve inoperative or subject to leaks. It has been found that sealing means constructed entirely of plastic material require frequent replacement when the valve is used in throttling type service. It has also been found that when such prior art valve sealing structures are utilized for handling liquified natural gas, LNG, that the fluid contains sand, dirt, or similar foreign particles that may become crushed between the valve disc and the sealing means, thereby scratching or damaging the sealing surfaces, both the resilient seal and the disc sealing surface, whereby the sealing qualities of the valve are deteriorated.The problem is particularly troublesome where metallic sealing means are used. The handling of liquified natural gas, LNG, has been found to be fire prone and LNG valves now must meet the specification of having a fire safe seat in the form of metallic sealing means. Various types of sealing means for these cryogenic and svecial f Duid handling means are available and are presently sold as providing a fire safe seal, including metallic seals. I have no knowledge, however, of a valve structure for an LNG application that is directed to the problem of preventing sand, dirt or similar foreign particles from affecting the sealing qualities of such cryogenic valves. The present invention provides an improved cryogenic butterfly valve having a bidirectional fire safe, metallic seal that is retrofittable to all present day bidirectional butterfly valves of the aforementioned prior art design U.S. Patent 3,650,508 without any machining being required or modification to the basic valve structure. The present invention is structured to prevent sand, dirt, or similar foreign particles from damaging the sealing properties of the improved metallic seal of the present invention including when it is used in LNG applications and where such foreign particles are normally found, and yet provides exceptional tight sealing capabilities. From a structural standpoint, the present invention provides an improved bidirectional sealing means for valves constructed in accordance with U. S. Patent No.3,650,508. The bidirectional seal of the present invention has a metallic substrate that has a thin layer of thermally sensitive, resilient material bonded to the pair of spaced sealing lobes for the sealing means. A third sealing lobe is defined from the metallic substrate and is arranged betwen the resiliently covered pair of spaced sealing lobes to provide a fire safe seal and to provide exceptionally tight sealing capabilities with a valve disc. The specific structural organization of the bidirectional valve comprehending the invention comprises a body member provided with a passageway for fluids, and a valve disc rotatably mounted in the passageway for controlling the flow of fluid therethrough. The valve is provided with a bidirectional metallic sealing means mounted in the passageway of the body member for coaction with the valve disc to seal off the flow of fluids through the body member in both fluid flow directions through the passageway. The sealing means is constructed and defined to have a pair of spaced beadlike projections for sealing engagement with the edge of the valve disc and which beadlike projections are provided with a thin layer of a thermally sensitive resilient material deposited over and along the sealing surface of the sealing means for engaging the valve disc in a leakproof fashion.This sealing means also includes a third beadlike projection arranged thereon intermediate the pair of spaced beadlike projections and spaced therefrom solely constructed of the metallic substrate for engaging the valve disc when it is moved to a closed position to provide a fire safe beadlike projection for the valve. The valve further includes spring means for mechanically loading the sealing means to effect a bidirectional seal at the beadlike projections, and mecahnical responsive spring means mounted adjacent the sealing means and providing a variable sealing load to compensate for the change in resiliency of the bonded plastic material due to temperature changes thereby maintaining leakproof performance even at cryogenic temperature. The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the drawings in which FIG. 1 is a front perspective view cf the bidirectional valve embodying the present invention and illustrating the valve disc in an open condition FIG. 2 is a cross sectional view taken along the line 2 2 of FIG. 1 FIG. 3 is an enlarged cross secional view of the sealing structure illustrated in FIG. 1 in the area of the circle marked as FIG. 3 and FIG. 4 is an enlarged view of the valve structure of FIG. 3 with parts omitted to illustrate the sealing structure in its relaxed condition corresponding to a valve open position. Now referring to the drawings, the bidirectional valve 10, which is the subject of the present invention, will be examined in more detail. It should be understood that the overall structural organization of the present invention is the same as that disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,650,508. The present disclosure, then, is directed to the structure of the valve 10 incorporating the improved bidirectional sealing means constructed in accordance with the teachings of the present invention The bidirectional valve 10 which is the subject of the present invention, will be described as it is embodied in a cryogenic or other special fluid handling valve particularly adapted for handling cryogenic fluids, including liquid and gaseous hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and methane, as well as other ambient temperature bipropellants and corrosive fluids which are compatible with the basic valve materials. The valve 10 as illustrated in the drawings, comprises a valve body 11 mounting a valve disc 12 secured to a valve operator shaft 13. The operator shaft 13 extends through a torque tube 14 in a conventional fashion. The valve disc 12 is arranged with the bidirectional sealing means of the present invention, which is generally identified by the reference numeral 15. The valve disc 12 is operated in the usual fashion, and can be rotated from a fully closed position to a fully open position It is illustrated in an open position in FIG. 1 and in a fully closed position in FIGS. 2 and 3. As in the structures disclosed inU. S. Patent Nos.3,260,496 and 3,650,508, the valve disc 12 is constructed and defined with a sealing surface 12A that is spherically defined to produce the desired sealing action. The valve disc 12 is preferably constructed as a butterfly type structure and is arranged in a slightly offset relationship to the sealing means 15 as well as being offset from a spherical in a direction perpendicular to the flow, as in the structures of the cryogenic valves constructed in accordance with Patents 3,260,496 and 3,650,508. The sealing means 15 comprises the sealing element 16 preferably constructed of a formed, annealed copper inner core. It should also be recognized that the sealing element 16 could be constructed of a stainless steel element.The sealing element 16 is provided with three sealing lobes 16a, 16b and 16C to provide exceptional tightness. The sealing surface of element 16, best illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4, functions as the seal substrate and has deposited along its sealing surface a film of Teflon on the order of 0.015 to 0.020 inches thick. The Teflon coating is deposited over the sealing lobes or beads 16a and 16b of the sealing 16a and b element 16.These dynamic sealing beads 16a and 16 are f arranged on the fluid exposed leg 16 of the sealing element 16 and are adapted to engage the valve disc 12. These bead like elements 16a and 16b are provided and arranged to engage the sealing surface 12a for the disc 12 when the latter is rotated to a fully closed position, as illustrated in FIG. 3 to effect the bidirectional seal in accordance with the direction of the fluid flow through the valve body 11. A third beadlike element 16 is constructed and defined intermediate the beadlike elements 16a and 16b, however, it is not provided with a thin layer of Teflon bonded thereto.In the actual manufacturing technique for providing the Teflon coating to the leg 16, the coating can be electrodeposited or heat press bonded to the entire leg 16f, including the portion that extends vertically above the sealing bead 16b, and then all of the material on the bead 16c proper is removed.The portion of Teflon coating enveloping the sealing bead 16a and the adjacent surfaces of the leg 16f art identified as the coating 16Ta, while the Teflon coating the sealing bead 16b and the adjacent surfaces is the coating 16Tb. This coating 16Tb extends around the leg 16f to the bridging leg between legs 16 and 16f, as best illustrated in FIG. 4.The Teflon coating can be either a fluorinated ethylene proplylene, FEP Teflon, or a perfluoroalkoxy, PFA Teflon, material. In the relaxed condition of the sealing leg 16 as illustrated in FIG. 4, the sealing beads 16a and 16b are constructed and defined to extend approximately 0.002 inches below the metallic seating lobe 16c. When the valve disc 12 is closed, then, the sealing beads 16a and 16b will crush due to the resiliency of the Teflon coating whereby all three sealing beads 16, 16, and 16c will engage the sealing surface 12a of the disc 12 when it is in a closed position. As is particularly evident fron examining FIGS. 3 and 4, it will be seen that the sealing element 16 has a generally U shaped construction in cross section and comprises the arms 16f and 16 of the , with an outwardly extending arm 16P. In this respect, the sealing element 16 is provided with such a U shaped configuration namely, through the provision of the legs IO and 16f to prevent the sealing elements from blowing out downstream in both fluid flow directions. The sealing leg 16P has a spacer 16s defined at one end to abut the valve body 11 and function as a static seal. This spacer 16s is also provided with a Teflon coating on the order of 0.002 inches thick of the same material as the coatings 16Ta and 16Tb. A retainer 17 is constructed and defined with a configuration conforming to that of the sealing element 16 for retaining it in the desired position within the valve 10. The retainer 17 is further defined and constructed to limit the radial displacement of the beads 16, 16, and 16C by means of the retaining arm 17 . The retaining a arm 17 extends into the interior of the U of the sealing element 16 or between the legs 16 and 160, as best viewed in FIG. 3.The coaction of these elements is such that the pressure on top of the outer seal leg 160 plus the mechanical and thermal loading provided by an outer spring 19 affects the seal at the seal bead 16b The outer spring 19 may be in the form of a metallic or aluminum hoop that is stretched around the seal leg 160 and has springlike characteristics to provide the required mechanical and thermal loading at the seal bead 16b This configuration of the seal leg 160 is pressure sensitive under the noraml flow direction or the fluid flow direction from right to left, as illustrted in FIG. 2, to effect a seal at seal bead 16b.When the fluid flow is in the reverse direction, or from left to right, as illustrated in FIG. 2, pressure from the top of the inner seal leg 16 plus the mechanical and thermal loading by the inner spring 18 effects the seal at the seal bead 16a. The inner spring 18 may also be a metal or aluminum hoop thais stretched around the inner seal leg 16 to provide the required mechanical and thermal loading of the seal bead 16a. Of course, it will be appreciated that any other means for mechanically loading the sealing element 16 may be employed, as long as such means has a higher thermal coefficient than the expansion of the disc 12. f The configuration of the seal leg 16 is pressure sensitive under the reverse flow direction to effect the seal at seal bead 16a The central sealing element 16C will always make contact with the valve disc 20 in the closed position, which will provide sealing against the disc in the event of a fire, or at all temperatures from cryogenic to fire condition. Also, when the Teflon coating provided for the beads 16a and 16b is destroyed, the sealing bead 16c will still engage the disc 12 in a sealing relationship. The sealing bead 16c is maintained in contact with the disc 12 by means of the springs 18 and 19. The variable sealing load provided by the springs 18 and 19 compensates for the change in resiliency of the bonded plastic material due to temperature changes thereby maintaining leakproof valve performance even at cryogenic temperatures. In certain valve applications, however, the springs 18 and 19 may not be necessary. The seal means 15 further comprehends a mechanical responsive loading means 20 arranged with the retaining element 17 and the sealing element 16. The mechanically responsive loading means 20 is illustrated as a conventional Belleville spring constructed of aluminum bronze and arranged adjacent the retainer 17. The end of the Belleville spring 20, opposite from the retainer 17, engages a loading ring 21 that is secured by means of conventional fasteners 22, as illustrated in FIG. 2 and are carried by the loading ring 23 and secured by a retaining ring 24. The fasteners 22 have their threaded ends securing the loading ring 21.The important feature of the loading means 20 or Belleville spring is that it provides essentially constant sealing load compensating for the non uniform expansions and contractions of the adjacent parts during periods of rapid temperature change, such as would occur when a warm valve i.e. ambient is suddently filled with cryogenic fluid The disclosed combination of static and dynamic sealing means then provide the virtually leakproof seal in both directions of fluid flow without danger of the seal blowing out downstream. The sealing element 16 is also provided with a static sealing portion illustrated in FIG. 3 as the sealing element 16S secured between the retainer 17 and the valve body 11. In addition to the compensation for the expansion and contraction of the sealing materials comprising the sealing element 16, it is also known that in certain applications that the fluid being processed by the valve 10 may contain sand, dirt, and similar particles. The constructions o the sealing element 16 with the Teflon coated sealing beads 16a and 16b are arranged so that they act as wipers to prevent any sand, dirt and particles from being crushed between the valve disc 12 and the bare netal center bead 16 of the sealing element 16 during the final degrees of valve closing. It is known that the resilient sealing materials function to sponge up sand particles, and the like, and are not damaged as are metallic seals.This wiping action will reduce the risk of scratching and damage to the center lobe 16c Accordingly, the center lobe 16C will make contact with the valve disc in the closed position in both directions of fluid flow, while the lobes 16a and 16b will function as forward and reverse seals to provide positive leaktight sealing for the valve 10. A further advantage of the sealing element 16 of the present invention is that it is retrofittable to all of the present day bidirectional valves constructed in accordance with U.S. Patent 3,650,508. Accordingly, the only additional parts necessary to replace the present day sealing elements would be to provide different size seal springs without any need of machine operations on the valve 10 or to make any further modifications. It should now be evident to those skilled in the art that the present day invention has provided an improved cryogenic and special fluid handling valve having improved sealing means that is capable of use at all temperatures from cryogenic to external fire temperatures, and that is used in environments where sand, dirt, etc., may be present in the fluids being controlled by the valve. The use of.a metallic substrate coated with a resilient plastic material as the sealing element provides the advantages of both types of sealing material in a simple sealing element. The valve is particularly adapted for cryogenic valves in which large temperature excursions are experienced, and affords an essentially leakproof seal for bidirectional fluid flow without deleterious effects.
