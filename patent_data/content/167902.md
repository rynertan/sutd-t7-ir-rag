# Vinyl acetate copolymer emulsions for paper coating compositions.

## Abstract
Aqueous vinyl ester copolymer emulsions possessing good dry pick and wet pick strengths in paper coating compositions comprise a vinyl ester copolymer colloidally dispersed in an aqueous medium, the copolymer consisting essentially of a a vinyl ester of a C₁ C₁₂ alkanoic acid, b about 0.1 to 10 wt of an ethylenically unsaturated mono or dicarboxylic acid or half ester thereof, c about 0.05 to 10 wt of a dicyclopentadienyl acrylate, and d 0 50 wt of an alkyl acrylate.
