# A levercontrol assembly.

## Abstract
A control assembly comprises a housing a control lever extending from the housing and pivotally mounted therein spring means arranged in the housing and effective to return the control lever automatically to a neutral position and a potentiometer for converting movement of the control lever relative to the housing from the aforesaid neutral posi tion to an electrical signal. According to the invention, the spring means 4 comprises two mutually connected tubular parts 8, 9 , between which the end of the control lever 3 located in the housing 2 is mounted for pivotal, but not rota tional, movement, wherein in the neutral position of the con trol lever 3 the longitudinal axis of respective tubular parts 8, 9 extends substantially at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the lever. The tubular parts 8, 9 are axially movable relative to the housing 2 against the action of a coil spring 12, 13 mounted in each of a respective one of the tubular parts and acting between the respective tubular parts and the housing 12 . The control assembly further comprises a sliding contact potentiometer 5 having a first part 30 which is connected to the tubular parts 8, 9 and extends parallel with the axial extension thereof, and a second part 31 which is firmly secured relative to the housing 2 .
