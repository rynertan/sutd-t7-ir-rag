# Regulation of gene expression by employing translational inhibition utilizing mRNA interfering complementary RNA.

## Abstract
Gene expression of the genetic material of cellular material or an organism is regulated or inhibited by incorpor ating in or along with the genetic material of the cellular material or organisms DNA or other genetic material which transcribes to an RNA which is complementary to and capable of binding to the mRNA of the genetic material of said organism. Gene expression or regulation of a gene is controlled by expressing a DNA fragment or replica of said gene inserted or positioned after a promoter in the opposite direction relative to the gene so as to regulate or inhibit the expression of said gene.
