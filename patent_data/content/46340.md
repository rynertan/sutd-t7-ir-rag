# Resin composition usable without being coated.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a resin composition which is usable for an exterior article without being coated on its sur face when molded into the article and is excellent in the color tone and has good impact resistance and weatherability, said composition comprising I 10 to 70 by weight of a high rubber content graft polymer obtained by polymerizing 50 to 10 by weight of a monomer mixture C comprising 10 to 90 by weight of at least one aromatic vinyl monomer and 90 to 10 by weight of at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer represented by the following general formula CH₂ CRX wherein R stands for a hydrogen atom or methyl group, and X stands for a group CN or COOR₁ in which R₁ stands for an alkyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, in the presence of a latex of a multi layer crosslinked acrylic rubber particles containing 5 to 30 by weight of a rigid crosslinked resin A having a core particle size of 0.15 to 0,40µ in the interior of the rubber particles and 45 to 85 by weight of a crosslinked acrylic acid ester poly mer B comprising an acrylic acid ester as the main component in the outer layer of the rubber particles, so that the total amount of the components A , B and C is 100 by weight, II 90 to 30 by weight of a thermoplastic resin obtained by polymerizing at least one alkyl acrylate or methacrylate represented by the following general formula CH₂ CRCOOR₁ wherein R stands for a hydrogen atom or methyl group, and R₁ stands for an alkyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, in an amount of at least 90 by weight, and III 0 to 50 by weight of a diene type rubber containing thermo plastic resin, the sum of the amount of the components I , II and III being 100 by weight.
