# Communication system.

## Abstract
A communication system has a first station SO and a plurality of further stations S1 S4 , two communication channels A, B , for transmission in opposite directions, serially connecting the stations. The first station includes routing means operable in a double looped mode to route signals received on each channel onto the respective other channel and the further stations each including routing means operable in a through mode to forward, in the same channel, signals received on each channel, thereby forming a single folded transmission path. Preferably the further stations each are responsive to the cessation of signalling energy e.g. a break in the transmission path on a channel to assume a looped mode in which signals received in the other channel are rerouted onto that channel, with the first station responding by assuming a through mode in which signals received on each channel are forwarded in the same channel, again forming a single folded transmission path following rerouting at two of the further stations.
