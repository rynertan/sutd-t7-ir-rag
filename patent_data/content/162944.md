# Thyristor converter control apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus for controlling a thyristor converter in cludes a plurality of voltage detectors 3, 4, 5 provided for individual series connected thyristors 1 respectively for detecting the presence or absence of voltage applied to the thyristors, and elements 6 1, 10 1, 7, 8 for generating a thyristor triggering pulse signal representative of the logical sum of the voltage presence absence signals from the voltage detectors and a triggering command signal com manding the desired triggering phase and on period of the thyristor converter. The apparatus comprises a plurality of differentiation circuits 6 1, 6 2 differentiating the output signals of the plural voltage detectors respectively, and a signal synthesis circuit 14 synthesizing the output signals of the differentiation circuits to generate an output signal indicative of the voltage presence or absence. By virtue of the above construction, the thyristor converter can con tinuosly operate without being shut down even when any one of the thyristor voltage detection signals is disabled.
