# Method and apparatus for translating and positioning a catheter.

## Abstract
A catheter assembly 10 , includes a flexible inner cath eter tube 11 which is telescopically translatable through a shorter, outer sheath tube 12 . The inner catheter tube 11 has an injection needle 19 projection from its distal end 13 which is retracted into the open distal end 14 of the sheath tube 12 as the sheath tube traverses the endoscope or other tubular passage. Upon reaching the desired loca tion, the needle 19 and the distal end 13 of the inner catheter tube 11 are projected from the distal end 14 of the sheath 12 by applying an axial force to the catheter tube at a location beyond the proximal end 17 of the sheath 12 . A positional locking mechanism includes an elastomer ic washer 30 which concentrically slidably engages the catheter tube 11 at a location beyond the proximal end 17 of the sheath 12 . The washer 30 is selectively axially compressed between two locking members 25, 21 which are disposed about the sheath 12 and catheter tube 11 , respectively. The washer 30 is radially constricted so that the axial compression produces a radial compression which results in a gripping action on the catheter tube 11 .

## Description
The present invention relates to catheters in general and, more particularly to a method and apparatus for facilitating translation and positionally locking a catheter. In a broader sense the present invention also relates to an improved locking mechanism which permits a flexible tube, which is telescopically and slidably mounted in a sheath tube, to be locked in position to prevent axial movement of the flexible tube with respect to the sheath tube. In the course of certain medical procedures involving an endoscopic device i.e. gastroscope, proctoscope, laparoscope, arthoscope, etc. , it is sometimes desirable to inject a medicament directly into organ tissue being visualized without resorting to any additional invasive r surgical procedure.In order to accomplish this, various prior art injection catheter devices have been developed which generally consist of a single lumen catheter with a needle attached at one end and a syringe attachment at the other. Such a device is intended to be inserted through one of the operative channels provided in an endoscope, thus providing an injection needle at the endoscope S distal end which can be controlled extracorporeally by the physician. On the surface this would seem to provide a satisfactory solution to the problem in practice, however, the difficulty in threading these devices through the endoscope all but precludes their use.If the injection catheter is inserted in a forward manner i.e., needle first, starting from the proximal or physician end of the endoscope the sharpened needle point repeatedly snags on the soft elastomeric lining of the operative channel, thereby damaging the lining, dulling and contaminating the needle, and frustrating the procedure. This problem has causedi some physicians to resort to inserting the injection catheter in a backward fashion i.e., hub end first starting from the distal end of the endoscope prior to placement of the endoscope within the patient. This is an undesirable solution to the problem for many reasons. First, the operative channel of the endoscope is rendered unavailable for use for other purposes such as biopsy for the duration of the procedure. Second, the syringe attachment means must be removed before the proximal end of the catheter is fitted through the endoscope, and then subsequently reattached.Third, extreme care must be exercised in maintaining proper placement of the catheter while the endoscope is inserted into the patient misalignment would result in the needle catching on either the endoscope or patient during insertion. It is clear from the foregoing that an improved device is needed one which can be easily passed through the proximal end of the endoscope, at will, after the endoscope has been properly located within the patient. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved catheter assembly which permits a catheter needle to be safely passed through a hollow passage without snagging onfhe passage walls. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus whereby an inner, flexible catheter tube can take advantage of the increased rigidity inherent in two concentric tubes during placement of the catheter needle and thereafter take advantage of the flexibility of the catheter tube to prevent inadvertent rupture at the injection site. It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of translating a flexible catheter and needle through an endoscope, blood vessel or other passage without snagging the needle on the passage walls using a protective sheath but wherein the distal end of the catheter can project from the distal end of the sheath to take advantage of the flexibility of the catheter to preclude inadvertent rupture at the injection site. It is still another object of the present invention to provide an improved mechanism for mutually locking two telescopically related tubes in place while simultaneously sealing one tube from the other. It is still a further object of the present invention to provide an improved positional locking mechanism for two telescopically related tubes without interrupting flow through the inner tube. In accordance with these and other objects of the present invention a flexible inner catheter tube is longer than and telescopically slidable within a more rigid, outer catheter sheath tube. An injection needle, secured to and projecting from the distal end of the inner catheter tube, is protected during traversal of an endoscope or blood vessel by retracting it into the distal end of the outer sheath tube. Upon reaching the injection site the needle may be projected a small distance from the distal sheath end hence, the greater rigidity of the larger diameter outer sheath tube may be used to minimize bending of the inner catheter tube during traversal of the endoscopic passage and during insertion of the needle into the tissue at the injection site.The outer sheath may be retracted after insertion of the needle at the injection site so that the flexible catheter tube minimizes rupture at the injection site by bending at the exposed portion of the flexible catheter. A locking mechanism comprises an elastomeric washer slidably engaged about the inner catheter tube at a location beyond the proximal end of the sheath. By axially compressing and radially constraining the washer, the axial compression produces radial compression of the washer about the inner catheter tube to preclude its axial displacement relative to the outer sheath at any location along its length. In the preferred embodiment, the washer is housed in a cup like member which receives a stem of a housing member in threaded engagement. The stem axially compresses the washer at the cup end wall while the cylindrical cup wall radially compresses the washer.The proximal end of the outer catheter sheath passes slidably through the housing member and stem and includes a flanged proximal end which engages the end of the stem to limit translation of the sheath in one direction relative to the housing member. When the stem compresses the washer in the cup like member, the washer bears axially agains che stem end serving to both positionally lock the sheath relative to the washer and to seal the annular opening surrounding the catheter tube at the proximal end of the sheath. The foregoing objects and features of the present invention will become more fully apparent from the following description and the appended claims taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Figure 1 is a side view in partial section of a catheter assembly of the preferred embodiment of the present invention Figure 2 is a detailed view in partial section of the positional locking mechanism employed in the assembly ofFigure 1 showing the mechanism disengaged Figure 3 is a detailed view in partial section of the locking mechanism of Figure 2 showing the mechanism in locked position Figure 4 is a schematic sectional view showing the distal end of the catheter assembly of Figure l traversing an operative channel of an endoscope or other tubular passage and Figure 3 is a sectional view showing the distal end of the catheter assembly of Figure 1 projecting from the distal end of the tubular passage. Referring to Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings in greater detail, a catheter assembly 10 includes an inner catheter tube 11 disposed for telescopic axial displacement in an outer catheter sheath tube 12. The inner tube 11 is considerably longer than the sheath tube 12 so as to permit the distal end 13 of the inner catheter tube 11 to project beyond the distal end 14 of the sheath tube. The proximal end 16 of the inner tube 11 also is long enough to extend beyond the proximal end 17 of the sheath tube 12. By way of example only, the sheath tube 12 may have a length of 150 cm whereas the inner catheter tube 11 would have a length of 225 cm these dimensions have been employed successfully in a working embodiment. The inner catheter tube 11 is telescopically translated axially within sheath tube 12 by grasping inner tube 11 between its proximal end 16 and the proximal end 17 of sheath tube 12 and pushing or pulling the inner tube with an axial force necessary to effect displacement either forward or backward, as desired. In this regard, the diametric clearance between the catheter tube 11 and sheath tube 12, as well as the materials of which they are made, are quite important. Excessive diametric clearance permits the inner catheter tube 11 to bend too much when it is pushed through the outer sheath tube 12 with the result that the inner catheter tube 11 tends to bunch up and kink, which impedes flow therethrough. This may also occur from axially applied pushing forces during tissue puncture with the catheter needle.On the other hand, the diametric clearance must be sufficient to permit the catheter tube to slide freely within the sheath tube. In the aforesaid working embodiment, by way of example only, the sheath tube 12 had an outsidevdiameter of 0.085 inches and an inside diameter of 0.050 inches the inner catheter tube 11 had an outside diameter of 0.044 inches and an inside diameter of 0.024 inches. The resulting 0.006 inches of diametric clearance i.e. , a 0.003 annular width clearance proved successful in permitting smooth telescopic translation without kinking. The materials used for the inner catheter tube 11 and sheath tube 12 affect the rigidity of the two tubes and the sliding frictional forces acting between them. Since the inner catheter tube 11 is relatively small in transverse section relative to its length, it tends to kink in the portion between application of the axial pushing force and the proximal end 17 of sheath tube 12 Thus, although inner tube 11 must be flexible to permit it to be extended through curved and tortuous passages, it must have sufficient rigidity to prevent such kinking. On the other hand, this kinking tendency is greater if the friction between the tubes is too resistive to axial pushing forces applied to the catheter tube. Therefore, apart from diametric clearance and catheter type flexibility considerations, the coefficients of friction for the tube materials are important.For the aforesaid working embodiment it has been found that polyethylene is a good choice of material for sheath tube 12 polytetrafluoroethylene Teflon was used for the inner catheter tube 11. One alternative material for the inner tube 11 would be stiff vinyl. The proximal end 16 of inner catheter tube 11 terminates in a female fitting such as a Luer fitting adapted to receive a connection from a supply of fluid under pressure to be delivered by the inner catheter tubeA hollow injection needle 19 is press fit or otnerutise bonded into the distal end 13 of the inner catheter tube 11 so as to project coaxiallytherefrom with a portion of the needle residing within the catheter tube. In the aforesaid preferred embodiment a 22 gauge stainless steel needle was employed with approximately 0.25 inches exposed from distal catheter tube end 13. It is important that the catheter assembly 10 include a locking mechanism whereby the relative axial positions of the tubes 11, 12 can be locked or fixed selectively over a continuous range of such positions. A positional locking collar generally designated at 20 is provided for effecting such locking. Locking collar 20 is illustrated in greater detail in Figures 2 and 3 to which specific reference is now made along with Figure 1. Cap 21 is a cup like member having an open end 22, an opposite end wall 23 and a generally cylindrical side wall 24. End wall 23 has an aperture 41 centrally defined therein which is adapted to slidably engage the inner catheter tube 11 between its proximal end 16 and the proximal end 17 of the outer sheath tube 12. The open end 22 of cap 21 faces the proximal end 17 of sheath tube 12.Cylindrical wall 24 is internally threaded to engage an externally threaded stem portion 27 of a housing member 25. Housing member 25 includes a longitudinal throughbore 26 in which sheath tube 12 is slidably engaged. Stem portion 27, which has a smaller outside diameter than the main housing body 28 from which it extends, has its end surface 29 contoured to match the contour of the generally radially extending flange at the proximal end 17 of sheath tube 12. End surface 29 thus serves as a stop past which sheath tube 12 cannot be pulled through housing member 25 in one direction to the right, as viewed in Figures 1, 2 and 3 . An elastomeric washer 30, made of rubber or similar material, is slidably mounted on the inner catheter tube 11 at a location berween the end wall 23 of cap member 21 and the flanged proximal end 17 of sheath tube 12. In the preferred embodiment, washer 30 is snuggly retained against the interior surface of end wall 23 which, along with adjacent portions of sidewall 24 is contoured to receive the matching washer contour in a friction fit.Washer 30 is annularly shaped and preferably has an axial length which gradually decreases toward its radial extremity. The central aperture in the washer has a diameter slightly larger than the outside diameter of catheter tube 11 so that, when washer 30 is free of radial compression, tube 11 can slide freely through the washer aperture. When the cap member I and housing member 25 are disengaged as illustrated in Figure 2 , or when these members are partially engaged without exerting axial pressure on washer 30, catheter tube 11 slides freely relative to washer 30, cap 21, housing 25 and sheath tube 12. When cap 21 and housing 25 are fully engaged, with stem 27 exerting axially compressive forces on washer 30 in cup like member 21, the peripherally constrained washer tends to expand slightly in a radially inward direction. This expansion is not enough to significantly restrict fluid flow through the inner catheter tube 11 but is sufficient to frictionally engage the inner tube 11 to prevent it from sliding through the washer 30. This condition is illustrated in Figures 1 and 3. Since the flanged proximal end 17 of the sheath is situated between the end surface 29 of stem 27 and the leading end of washer 30, the flanged end 17 is preferably contoured, as shown, to match the portions of the leading end of washer 30. This enhances the peripheral constraints on the washer 30 when it is axially compressed so that radially inward compressive forces can be more efficiently exerted by the washer 30 on the inner catheter tube 11. Additionally, the flanged end 17 is designed to provide a smooth, anti frictional surface against which the stem 27 may easily turn. Apart from locking the inner catheter tube 11 in place relative to washer 30, the axially compressive forces applied by virtue of full engagement between cap 21 and housing stem 27 act to positionally lock the flanged proximal end 17 of sheath tube 12 against end surface 29 of stem 27. At the same time, washer 30 seals the proximal end 17 of sheath tube 12. Therefore, the simple action of threadingly engaging cap 21 and housing stem 27 has the following effects a the washer 30 is compressed by stem 27 so that the inner catheter tube 11 is positionally fixed b sheath tube 12 is sealed at its proximal end 17 by the leading end of washer 30 and c the outer sheath tube 12 is positionally fixed relative to the inner catheter tube 11.It should be noted that this multiple effect, achieved with a single threaded engagement, requires only three parts, namely cap member 21, housing member 25 and washer 30. The locking collar 20 described above has a number of other advantages The collar effectively terminates the proximal end of the sheath tube 12 which, in the preferred embodiment, is made of polyethylene, This eliminates the need for conventional bonding procedures between the collar and sheath tube Further, locking collar 20 provides for positional locking over substantially the entire length of inner tube rr . In addition, locking is achieved without kinking or damaging the inner catheter tube and without restricting flow therethrough. As noted above, locking collar 20 also provides a fluid tight seal between tubes 11 and 12. Figure 4 illustrates the distal end of the catheter assembly of Figure 1 traversing a tubular passage 35 such as an operative channel in an endoscope. The catheter tube 11 is shown retracted into sheath 12 and locked in position so that catheter needle 19 and distal end 13 of the catheter tube are disposed rearward of the distal end 14 of the sheath. The needle is therefore protected by sheath 12 from snagging or puncturing the endoscope during translation of the sheath or catheter. Upon reaching the location of intended tissue puncture, sheath tube 12 is extended somewhat beyond the distal end of the endoscope, as seen in Figure 5. For this purpose the sheath should obviously be made somewhat longer than the endoscope.The inner catheter tube 11 is then unlocked by unscrewing cap 21 and inner tube 11 is pushed while holding the sheath tube 12 until the sharpened tip of needle 19 extends beyond distal end 14 of the sheath. The catheter tube 11 is then locked again by screwing the stem 27 into cap 21, and the assembly is advanced until needle 19 punctures tissue 40. It is advantageous to use the greater rigidity the sheath tube 12 in applying the puncture force to prevent the smaller, more flexible inner catheter tube 11 from buckling if it alone were used to transmit the puncture force. After the puncture is made catheter tube 11 is again unlocked and sheath 12 may be retracted by pulling on locking collar 20 while holding catheter tube 11 steady, to expose a desired length of catheter tube 11 beyond the distal end 14 of the sheath. The desired exposed length of catheter tube 11 thus provides a degree of flexibility required at the puncture location to prevent rupture from inadvertent lateral movement of the needle. Although the preferred embodiment of the present invention is described for transendoscopic applications, such as transendoscopic sclerosing of esophageal varices while under balloon tamponade, it will be appreciated that additional applications exist in any situation where it is desired to inject a fluid substance into a biological membrane or tissue at a location distal from the fluid pressure source and where the preferred method of transport of the needle and its attendant catheter tube is through the lumen of a hollow, tubular structure such as a blood vessel or the operative channel of an endoscope. The invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiment is to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive and the scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope.
