## Description
The present invention relates to a method for the purification of hepatitis B virus core antigen hereinafter referred to as HBc antigen , and a method for the measurement of HBc antibodies using said purified HBc antigen. More particularly, it relates to a method for the purification of HBc antigen produced by recombinant organisms constructed by means of DNA recombination techniques, and to a method for the measurement of HBc antibodies using said highly purified HBc antigen. Hepatitis B is a disease which is induced by a hepatitis B virus hereinafter, referred to as HBV and includes immunologically and clinically very serious problems, but there has never been found any effective therapeutic method therefor. This disease has been observed worldwidely, particularly in Asian and African areas, and hence, it has been desired to find an effective prophylactic and therapeutic method therefor. HBV is a spherical virus having a diameter of 42 nm and consists of surface and core which have separate antigenicity and are called HBs antigen and HBc antigen, respectively. It is also known that there is another antigen of HBV, i.e. HBe antigen reported by Magnius et al. cf. J. Immunology, For prophylaxis of this disease, it is very important to discover the infection with HBV at an early stage. For the diagnosis of the infection with HBV, there are utilized antigen antibody systems such as HBs antigen antibody, HBc antigen antibody and HBe antigen antibody. Among these, except HBc which is almostly not present in the blood, five antigens and antibodies can be measured by immunological methods such as PHA, r PHA, EIA and RIA. Particularly, HBe antigen is very important as an index for diagnosis of infection with HBV. It is known that HBe is a derivative of an HBc antigen protein and hence is dominated by HBc gene. That is, when the product is associated to form a completely spherical particle, it shows an antigenicity as HBc, but on the other hand, when the product is dissociated, it shows other antigenicity as HBe cf. Kan Tan Sui Liver Gall Pancreas , For the measurement of HBc antibodies, a pure HBc antigen is necessary. However, HBV antigen is not present in blood flow as HBc antigen per se and HBc antigen must be isolated from human liver. Besides, it is very difficult to isolate it from human liver, which is accompanied with some danger of infection. Thus, since the isolation of HBc antigen is restricted, the human origin HBc antigen has merely been used in research laboratories for measuring HBc antibody. Known methods for the purification of liver origin HBc antigen are a combination of a density gradient centrifugation and a gel filtration cf. Budkowaska, A. et al., J. Immunology, In case of purification of HBc antigen obtained from recombinant organisms, there are some problems that the components contaminating in the starting materials, such as recombinant origin proteins, lipids and other components, are essentially different from the contaminants in case of HBc antigen obtained from human liver and human blood not only in the quality but also in the quantity, and hence, it can not sufficiently be purified by conventional purification methods. Even by the method of the above Roggendorf et al. wherein it has been tried to purify recombinant origin HBc antigen, it has merely been purified in such a degree that it can be analyzed. The resulting product, however, is not pure enough to be used as a diagnostic product or a vaccine. Besides, it has never been studied as to the yield thereof. Thus, such a method can not be used for the purification of a recombinant origin HBc antigen on an industrial scale. Recently, there has been on the market a PHA reagent for detecting HBc antibodies which is prepared by expressing the HBc antigen in By extensive studies on safe and practical methods for the purification of recombinant origin HBc antigen by the present inventors, it has now been found that when the pH of the HBc antigen material obtained from the culture of recombinant organisms which contains recombinant origin contaminants is made acidic with an acid, the contaminant lipids and proteins which interfer chromatography of the HBc antigen are almost precipitated and can be separated from the HBc antigen. The HBc antigen thus separated can easily and highly be purified by subjecting it to an ion exchange chromatography with an anion exchanger, optionally followed by a density gradient centrifugation. The HBc antigen thus purified is useful for the measurement of HBc antibodies. An object of the present invention is to provide a method for purification of a stable, safe and inexpensive HBc antigen on an industrial scale. Another object of the invention is to provide a purification method of HBc antigen obtained from recombinant organisms constructed by DNA recombination techniques in a high purity and on a large scale. A further object of the invention is to provide a method for the measurement of HBc antibodies using the highly purified HBc antigen. These and other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description. Fig. 1 shows a correlation between the method of measuring HBc antibody by the present invention and that of the conventional PHA method. Fig. 2 shows a correlation between inhibition rate in the method of the present invention and that of the conventional PHA method. Fig. 3 shows a reactivity of yHBcAg sensitized beads of the present invention against HBe antibody and that of a commercially available hHBcAg sensitized beads. The method of the present invention for the purification of HBc antigen, particulary HBc antigen produced by recombinant organisms constructed, by DNA recombination techniques, is characterized in that the pH of a starting materials containing HBc antigen obtained from a culture of a recombinant organism and also containing recombinant origin components is made acidic by adding an acid, and thereby precipitating and removing most of the lipids and contaminant proteins which bar the subsequent chromatography, and in that the supernatant is subjected to an ion exchange chromatography with an anion exchanger directly or after subjecting the supernatant to purification by saltiig out with ammonium sulfate or after being concentrated. The starting HBc antigen material used in the present invention is obtained by culturing a recombinant organism obtained by DNA recombination techniques which is capable of producing HBc antigen, for instance recombinant Examples of the recombinant organisms being capable of producing HBc antigen are published by the present inventors cf. Saibo Kogaku Cell Technology , Plasmid pHBV containing whole DNA sequences of HBV of. JP A 36699 1984 and Alternatively, the above plasmid pAHBc is partially digested with the restriction enzyme Xho I to remove the pre C region at the 5 end thereof. The resulting plasmid is treated with T₄ DNA synthetase to convert the cohesive ends thereof into flush ends. Subsequently, an EcoRI site is added to the Xho I site thereof with a EcoRI linker. There is selected a plasmid wherein the Xho I site at 5 end of the HBc gene is converted into an EcoRI site. The thus obtained plasmid pHBc 1 is digested with EcoRI and further with BAL 31 and a Sal I linker is attached. Then, the plasmid is digested with the restriction enzymes Xho I and Sal I to give an HBc gene fragment wherein the pre C region of about 600 bp is removed. The thus obtained fragment is inserted into the Sal I site of the shuttle vector pAM 81 cf. JP A 36699 1984 and EP A 0103201 . The resulting vector pAC 701 is suitable for expressing HBc. The above vectors suitable for expressing HBc are used to transform the yeast Extraction of HBc antigen from the culture can be carried out by separating cells from the culture by centrifugation, and fracturing the cells in an appropriate buffer solution. The fracturing is carried out by conventional methods such as ultrasonic fracture, glass beads fracture, Manton Gaulin fracture, or enzymatic degradation of the cell walls, followed by fracturing the resulting spheroplasts with a detergent. The fractured cells are subjected to centrifugation at a slow speed to remove the cell wall pieces, and further optionally to filtering with a membrane filter to give the desired starting HBc antigen containing material. The pH of the starting HBc antigen containing material is made acidic by adding an acid and thereby most of the lipids and contaminant proteins which bar the subsequent chromatography are removed as precipitates. The remaining material is subjected to an ion exchange chromatography with an anion exchanger and furthermore optionally to a density gradient centrifugation to give the desired highly purified HBc antigen. The acids used in the above acidification step include inorganic acids e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, etc. and organic acids e.g. acetic acid, oxalic acid, etc. . The acidification with an acid is effected so as to regulate the pH of the material in the range of not higher than 6, preferably in the range of pH 5.0 to 5.5. The acidification treatment is usually carried out at a temperature of not higher than 20 C, preferably in the range of 4 to 10 C. After the regulation of the pH, the resulting precipitates are separated by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing HBc antigen is obtained. The HBc antigen containing solution thus obtained is optionally subjected to purification by salting out with ammonium sulfate and or to concentration. That is, the supernatant containing HBc antigen is regulated to pH 6.0 to 8.0 by adding thereto aqueous ammonia having an appropriate concentration, and the resulting precipitates of HBc antigen are separated from the supernatant by centrifugation. The precipitates thus obtained are dissolved in an appropriate neutral buffer solution having an ion strength of about 0.001 to 1.0 e.g. 0.1 M phosphate buffer and subjected to dialysis with the same buffer as above to give a material for subjecting to a chromatography with an anion exchanger. If no salting out with ammonium sulfate is carried out, the HBc antigen containing supernatant is neutralized, i.e. regulated to about pH 7.0, with aqueous ammonia and then diluted with the same buffer as above or subjected to dialysis with the same buffer as above to give the desired material for chromatography. The anion exchanger used from the chromatography is host preferably an anion exchanger having diethylaminoethyl groups as functional groups and includes all commercially available products, such as DEAE Sephadex A 25, DEAE Sephadex A 50, DEAE Sepharose and DEAE Sephacel manufactured by Pharmacia Fine Chemicals , DEAE Bio Gel A and Cellex D manufactured by Bio Rad Co. , and DEAE Cellulofine manufactured by Seikagaku Kogyo K.K., Japan . The ion exchange chromatography with these anion exchangers is carried out as follows. Adsorption of HBc antigen to the anion exchanger is carried out by a batch method or a column method. In case of the column method, a column packed with an anion exchanger is equilibrated by passing through the same buffer solution as used in the above preparation of the material for chromatography, and then, the HBc antigen containing solution is passed through, by which HBc antigen is adsorbed onto the anion exchanger but the recombinant origin contaminants are passed without being adsorbed. Thereafter, the column is washed with the same buffer as used for the equilibration to wash out the contaminants, and then, the column is subjected to the subsequent elution step. In case of a batch method, an anion exchanger equilibrated with a buffer is added to the HBc antigen containing solution, and the mixture is stirred at a low speed for about 0.5 to 2 hours to adsorb HBc antigen onto the exchanger. After the adsorption, the anion exchanger is collected on a filter, and the exchanger gel thus obtained is washed with the same buffer as used for equilibration, followed by filtration. This treatment is repeated several times, and the resulting HBc antigen adsorbed exchanger is subjected to the subsequent elution step. In this batch method, the HBc antigen adsorbed exchanger is preferably packed in a column and then subjected to the elution. The elution is carried out by a stepwise elution or a concentration gradient elution with a buffer solution having a higher ion strength than that of the buffer for equilibration, i.e. having an ion strength of about 0.01 to 0.5, and thereby HBc antigen is separated from the remaining adsorbed contaminants to give an HBc antigen containing fraction. The concentration gradient elution can be carried out by using sodium chloride added 0.01 M phosphate buffer having a concentration gradient of 0.01 0.5 M or any other buffer solutions having an appropriate concentration gradient effective for separation of HBc antigen from the contaminants. The stepwise elution can be carried out by passing through a buffer solution having an ion strength which is effective for elution only one of either HBc antigen or contaminants, followed by passing through a buffer having a stronger ion strength, by which a fraction containing highly purified HBc antigen is obtained. The HBc antigen thus purified may optionally be subjected to further purification methods, such as sucrose step gradient centrifugation or sucrose linear gradient centrifugation, followed by precipitation equilibrium centrifugation or linear gradient centrifugation with cesium chloride, by which a further highly purified HBc antigen can be obtained. In order to enhance the degree of purity of the HBc antigen in the ion exchange chromatography or to enhance the degree of purity of HBc antigen in the fractions pooled in a wide range in the chromatography, the ion exchange chromatography is preferably combined with a chromatography with hydroxyapatite. The hydroxyapatite is a gel for affinity chromatography which is composed of calcium phosphate and includes a commercially available Hydroxyapatite manufactured by Seikagaku Kogyo K.K. and ALBIOCHEM BEHRING and Hydroxylapatite manufactured by Bio Rad Co. . That is, the HBc antigen containing fraction is dialyzed against an appropriate neutral buffer having an ion strength of about 0.01 to 0.2 e.g. 0.1 M phosphate buffer or diluted with the same buffer as above, and then equilibrated with the same buffer as above, and the resulting solution is passed through a hydroxyapatite column, whereby the HBc antigen is not adsorbed but is recovered in the passed through fraction. The present inventors have tried to purify the recombinant origin HBc antigen by using various conventional gels for chromatography, such as CM cellulose, CM Sepharose , cellulose phosphate, etc. instead of the anion exchanger, but could not obtain the desired purification effect. The HBc antigen purified above can be used for various immunological measurements of HBc antibodies, such as the PHA method reverse passive hemagglutination method , the r PHA method reverse passive hemagglutination method , the EIA method enzyme immunoassay method , and the RIA method radioimmunoassay method . These measurements are carried out as follows. The HBc antigen purified above is sensitized to a carrier with tannic acid or the like to prepare a sensitized carrier for passive carrier agglutination. The carrier includes mammalian or bird erythrocytes immobilized with formalin or glutaraldehyde or artificial carriers. The artificial carriers include latex polystyrene particles, gelatin, epoxy resins, cellulose resins, active carbon, and the like. The antigen sensitized carriers thus prepared show an agglutination image in the presence of an antibody against a certain amount of an antigen. Accordingly, the HBc antibody can be measured by evaluating the agglutination The antigen sensitized carriers can be kept in a phosphate buffered sodium chloride solution PBS containing 1 normal rabbit serum NRS and 0.1 sodium nitride, and it can be used when desired. In case of the measurement by EIA method or RIA method, there are used as the carrier polystyrene beads, polystyrene tube, a plain bottom plate for ELISA Nunc Immuno Plate, manufactured by Nunc Co, and FLAT BOTTOM MICROELISA PLATES, manufactured by Immulon Dinateck Co. . The sensitization with antigen to a solid carrier is usually carried out by a non specific adsorption or with a crosslinking agent such as glutaraldehyde. In case of a non specific adsorption method, the HBc antigen is added to a buffer having pH 9 10 e.g. carbonate buffer to prepare an HBc antigen solution containing an appropriate amount of HBc, and the solid carrier in case of beads is dipped in the antigen solution for a sufficient time, or the antigen solution is entered into wells or tube of the solid carrier and allowed to stand for a sufficient time, by which the anitigen is adsorbed onto the solid carrier. The time for dipping or allowing to stand is preferably about 2 hours at 37 C or overnight at 4 C. The antigen adsorbed solid carrier is treated with PBS containing 1 bovine serum albumin BSA in order to decrease non specific reaction. In case of using a crosslinking agent such as glutaraldehyde, the solid carrier is treated with a buffer pH 9 10 e.g. carbonate buffer containing a few or several of a crosslinking agent e.g. glutaraldehyde for a sufficient time. The time is preferably about 2 hours at 37 C or overnight at 4 C. It is sensitized with the antigen and BSA like the above. The measurement of HBc antibody with the solid carrier prepared above is usually carried out by a non competition method and a competition method. In case of a non competition method, the solid carrier is reacted with the test sample and then is washed with a buffer. Detection of IgG reacted with HBc antigen is carried out by reacting with anti human IgG antibody or protein A which is labelled with an enzyme e.g. peroxidase in case of human origin test sample . After washing, a substrate is added to the reaction mixture which can be colored by the labelling enzyme, and thereafter, an appropriate reaction stopper e.g. sulfuric acid is added to the reaction mixture to stop the reaction, and then, the degree of color of the reaction mixture is measured with a photometer. In case of a competition method, the reaction of the solid carrier and the test sample is carried out in the presence of a fixed amount of an enzyme labelled anti HBc antibody, whereby the anti HBc antibody contained in the test sample competes with the enzyme labelled anti HBc antibody as to the antigen immobilized onto the solid carrier. After the reaction, the reaction mixture is colored as above, by which the degree of color is decreased in proportion to the amount of anti HBc antibody contained in the test sample. The RIA method can be carried out by the same principle as the EIA method, except that a radioisotope labelled anti human IgG antibody or a radioisotope labelled protein A is used instead of an enzyme labelled anti human IgG antibody, and a radioisotope labelled anti HBc antibody is used instead of an enzyme labelled anti HBc antibody, and further the radioactivity is measured with an appropriate device which can detect the radioisotope used for labelling. The present invention is illustrated by the following Examples. Examples of the purification of HBc antigen are illustrated below. A recombinant yeast, The crude extract is regulated to pH 5.4 by adding thereto dropwise acetic acid, while checking the pH with a pH meter. After stirring the mixture at 4 C for about 30 minutes, the precipitates are removed by centrifugation. While maintaining the supernatant at pH 6.5 by adding thereto aqueous ammonia, ammonium sulfate is gradually added until the final concentration of 2.5 M. The mixture is stirred at 4 C for 30 minutes and allowed to stand overnight. The resulting precipitates containing HBc antigen are separated by centrifugation. The precipitates thus obtained are suspended in 10 mM phosphate buffer 50 mM potassium chloride pH 7.3, about 300 ml and the mixture is dialyzed against the same buffer as above about 100 folds by volume with a tube for dialysis. After the dialysis, the solution is diluted about 3 folds with a 10 mM phosphate buffer 50 mM potassium chloride pH 7.3 . The diluted solution is added to a column packed with DEAE cellulose gel gel amount about 1 liter which is previously equilibrated with the same buffer as above, by which HBc antigen is adsorbed on the gel. The column is washed well with the same buffer as used for equilibration, and then subjced to elution by passing through 50 mM 500 mM potassium chloride concentration gradient phosphate buffer, and HBc antigen containing fractions are collected. The collected fractions are pooled and concentrated with a ultrafiltration concentrator Amicon TCF 10 manufactured by Amicon Co. . In a ultracentrifugation tube there are piled up 60 sucrose solution, 20 sucrose solution and the concentrated HBc solution in an amount of 10 ml, 35 ml and 35 ml, respectively, and the tube is subjected to ultrafiltration at 30,000 r.p.m., at 4 C for 19 hours, and thereby, HBC antigen is concentrated and purified at the interface of the sucrose solutions. The HBc antigen fraction thus obtained is dialyzed against a mixture of 50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM sodium chloride and 1mM EDTA pH 7.5 , and thereto is added cesium chloride in a concentration of 1.32 g ml, and the mixture is ultracentrifuged at 30,000 r.p.m., at 4 C for 60 hours to give a purified HBc antigen. The recovery rate and purification degree of HBc in each step are shown in Table 1. In the same manner as described in Example 1, HBc antigen is concentrated and purified at the interface of sucrose solutions. The HBc antigen containing fractions thus obtained are dialyzed against 0.1 M phosphate buffers pH 7.3 , and then passed through a hydroxyapatite column which is previously equilibrated with the same buffer as above. The fractions passed through which contains HBc antigen without being adsorbed are pooled, and to the pooled fraction is added cesium chloride in a concentration of 1.32 g ml, and the mixture is ultracentrifuged at 30,000 r.p.m., at 4 C for 60 hours to give a purified HBc antigen. The recovery rate and purification degree in each step are shown in Table 2. To the cells 100 g obtained by culturing a recombinant yeast, The crude extract is purified in the same manner as described in Example 1 to give a purified HBc antigen. The recovery rate and purification degree of HBc antigen in each step are shown in Table 3. To cells 200 g obtained by culturing a recombinant yeast To the crude extract is added 40 w w polyethylene glycol 6,000 in a final concentration of 3 , and the mixture is stirred at 4 C for 1 hour, and then centrifuged to remove the supernatant. The precipitates are suspended in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer 50 mM potassium chloride pH 7.2, 80 ml . The suspension is subjected to ultrasonic treatment for 5 minutes to solubilize. The resulting solution is dialyzed against 10mM potassium phosphate buffer 50 mM KCl pH 7.2 at 4 C overnight, and is added to DEAE cellulose. The mixture is treated in the same manner as described in Example 1 to prepare a purified HBc antigen. The recovery rate and purification degree of HBc antigen in each step are shown in Table 4. Examples of the measurement of HBc antibody are illustrated below. A blood 100 ml of sheep is mixed with Alsever s solution 100 ml , and the mixture is filtered with cotton gauze, and the concentration of erythrocytes is measured by hematocrit. The precipitates obtained by the above filtration are washed with a physiological saline solution 5 times and treated in the same manner as described by Abram B. Stavitsky cf. Methods in Immunology and Immunochemistry, That is, to the washed precipitates of erythrocyte obtained above is added 8 folds amount of a cold 3 solution of formaldehyde in a physiological saline solution, and the mixture is slowly stirred at 4 C for 24 hours. To the mixture is further added 2 folds amount of a cold 37 formaldehyde solution, and the mixture is stirred at 4 C for 2 hours. The mixture is filtered with a cotton gauze, and the erythrocytes are washed with a physiological saline solution 8 times, and is suspended in PBS in a concentration of 2.5 , and thereto is added 1 100 amount of sodium nitride. The mixture is reserved at 4 C. The immobilized sheep erythrocytes prepared above are washed with PBS two times, and are suspended in PBS in a concentration of erythrocyte of 2.5 . The mixture is treated in the same manner as described in the above mentioned literature, Methods in Immunology and Immunochemistry, Separately, the HBc antigen purified in Example 1 is diluted with PBS so as to be a concentration of antigen in a range of 0.005 0.2 at OD₂₈₀. The diluted HBc antigen solution is mixed with the same amount of the above tannic acid treated erythrocytes, and the mixture is reacted at 37 C for 3o minutes to sensitize well. The erythrocytes thus treated are suspended in PBS containing 1 normal rabbit blood serum NRS and 0.1 sodium nitride so as to be a concentration of erythrocyte of 0.75 , and thereby, sensitized erythrocytes 100 ml are obtained. Measurement of HBc antibody by passive hemagglutination Human sera 45 samples were continuously diluted in two folds on a microtiter plate. The dilution was carried out with 1 NRS containing PBS. After the dilution, the sensitized erythrocytes were added thereto, and the mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 hours, and the antibody value was measured by the agglutination pattern. The results are shown in Table 5, wherein the data obtained by PHA method using a commercially available In case of the PHA method of the present invention and the PHA method using a commercially available As a result, the evaluation was completely the same between the method of the present invention and the PHA method using Besides, the antibody value in the present invention was well correlative with that of the PHA method using Polystyrene beads diameter about 6 mm is dipped overnight in a carbonate buffer pH 9.5 containing 2.5 g glutaraldehyde to treat the surface thereof. The beads are washed lightly with distilled water, and then dipped overnight in a phosphate buffer pH 7.2 which contains HBc antigen yHBcAg produced by an yeast, by which the beads are sensitized. In order to decrease occurrence of non specific reaction, the same beads as above are sensitized with bovine serum albumin BSA . Reactivities of the sensitized beads to HBc antibody, HBs antibody and Hbe antibody were compared with those to human origin HBc antigen hHBcAg, a commercially available product . Beads sensitized with yHBcAg and beads sensitized only with BSA were prepared. In order to compare the beads thus prepared with commercially available beads sensitized with hHBcAg, these beads were entered into a tube having an appropriate size, and thereto were added ¹²⁵I labelled HBc antibody or HBs antibody 200 µl , and they were reacted at room temperature overnight. After washing with distilled water, the amount of antibody bound to the beads was measured by counting the radioactivity with a gamma ray counter. Beads sensitized only with BSA were used as a control. The results are shown in Table 6. The beads sensitized with yHBcAg showed ten times lower reactivity than that of beads sensitized with hHBcAg in the reactivity to HBs antibody. It will be assumed from the above that yHBcAg was almost not contaminated with HBsAg, but on the other hand, the human origin HBcAg was contaminated with HBsAg. That is, since the hHBcAg was prepared by using human origin plasma or liver as the starting material, and the contaminated HBsAg would not completely be removed by purification thereof. By the way, the reactivity to HBc antibody was not different between them. In order to study whether there is any difference in antigenicity between the HBc antigen expressed in an yeast and the human origin HBc antigen, the beads sensitized with yHBcAg of the present invention and beads sensitized with hHBcAg were prepared and the reactivity thereof to HBe antibody was tested. The results are shown in the accompanying Fig. 3. As is clear from the figure, both showed almost no difference. From the above experimental results, it will be clear that the beads sensitized with HBc antigen produced by an yeast can be used instead of beads sensitized with a human origin HBc antigen for the measurement of HBc antibody by RIA method. It will be apparent that the same or similar results are also obtained in case of EIA method.
