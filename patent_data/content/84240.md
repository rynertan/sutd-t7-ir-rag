# CLOSE COUPLED UNITIZED POWER SYSTEM ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A closely coupled power system assembly is disclosed in which a rotary lobe device 42 , such as a pump, blower or a fan, is closely coupled to a variable speed drive 21 or gear type hydraulic motor. Close coupling is accomplished by incorporating adaption structure for the two counter rotating shaft 44, 46 of the rotary lobe device 42 into the variable speed drive train 61 or hydraulic motor so that bearings 66, 67 , gear 62, 63, 64 , seals 49 and the like perform a dual function.
