# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING OLEFIN POLYMER.

## Abstract
A process for producing polyolefin, in particular, polyethylene, suited for extrusion molding or blow molding due to its wide molecular weight distribution, which comprises polymerizing olefin like ethylene using a solid catalyst component containing as transition metal compound ingredients titanium, vanadium, and zirconium or hafnium obtained by mixing and reacting organic oxidized or halogenated compounds of A titanium, B vanadium, and C zirconium or hafnium, with D organoaluminum compound, and using an organoaluminum compound as a co catalyst.
