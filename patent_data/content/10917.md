# Method of assessing foetal lung maturity.

## Abstract
A method of determining foetal lung maturity by refe rence to the lamellar body derived phospholipid level in amniotic fluid surrounding a foetus. A sample of the am niotic fluids is subjected to centrifugation over a cushion material, and lamellar body material which forms a band at the interface between the cushion material and the amino tic fluid during centrifugation is isolated and analysed to determine its phospholipid level. A phospholipid level which is determined to be greater than about 3.5 to 5.0 mg dl of amniotic fluid indicates a mature foetal lung.
