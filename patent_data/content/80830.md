## Abstract
Paper leaves, conveyed through a conveyor belt system 2 , are inserted into arcuate grooves 104a of rotating conveying wheels 103a, 103b and subjected to a running speed reduction, and discharged under the rotating con veying wheels 103a, 103b into a space 119 by the use of a stopper 122 . When the number of paper leaves Y falling into the space 119 reaches a preset count, for example 100 , projecting devices 134, 135 are actuated to project bar elements 137a, 137b into the space 119 , with paper leaves exceeding the preset count being piled on the bar elements 137a, 137b . The preset number of paper leaves are then transferred from the space 119 . Once transfer is complete, the bar elements 137a, 137b are retracted enabling the paper leaves collected thereupon to fall into the space 119 .
