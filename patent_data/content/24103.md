# Tubular telescopic device and apparatus with which it is used.

## Abstract
A spraying lance includes telescopic tubes 1 and 4 . The inner end of the inner tube 1 supports a sliding seal 3 consisting of a tubular sealing member 8 of which a tubular portion 10 fits co axially in the tube 1 and a tubular portion 11 seals a gap 50 between the tubes 1, 4 , and a retaining pin 9 which compresses the portion 10 between itself and the tube 1 . The outer end of the tube 4 has turnably threaded thereon a tightening sleeve 17 providing internally an oblique camming surface 22 which, as the sleeve 17 is tightened, cams a split collar 20 inwards to cause it to grasp firmly the tube 1 . A handle 7 of the lance has an internal flange 33 whereby it clamps a flexible hose 31 against a nipple 29 of a liquid flow control valve 6 .
