# Integrated oral magnetic osteogenic and orthodontic appliances.

## Abstract
An oral osteogenic and orthodontic appliance includes at least a pair of permanent magnets 25 adapted to be mounted on the upper and lower jaws so that, during relative move ment of the jaws, the fields of the magnets will be displaced relative to each other to promote osteogenesis and soft tissue repair. A dental module 11 for use in the appliance com prises a sleeve 24 of non corrosive and electrically conduc tive material encasing a respective one of the magnets and exposing the magnet only at its poles, and means for fixing the magnet within the sleeve to prevent movement between the magnet and the sleeve.
