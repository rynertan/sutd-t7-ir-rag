# Valve system for controlling flowable toxic material such as particulate radioactive waste.

## Abstract
Method and means for solidifying nuclear waste for permanent disposal are disclosed. A storage container, in the preferred form of a drum or barrel, is charged with a predetermined amount of liquid polymer resin in an uncatalyzed state. Catalyst containing frangible am poules are also positioned in the drum with a rotatable mixer mechanism. At a waste filling station, the mixer is rotated to break the ampoules so as to mix the cata lyst and the resin. The catalyzed resin is then mixed with added waste material to completely encapsulate the waste prior to solidification of the resin. Monitoring of the filling and mixing process is provided by continu ally sensing the torque force being applied to the rotating mixer mechanism. Where the waste is a dust like, dry particulate material, dust control means and method are also provided. The supply of waste passes through a downwardly extending conduit 34 and through a valve 36 . The valve 36 includes a housing 161, 162 defining a pressurised chamber 164 . First and second fixed valve members 166, 167 include inlet and outlet passages 171, 174 . A movable valve member 168 is mounted in sliding sealing engagement between the fixed valve members 166, 167 and includes a pas sage 177 to either open or close communication be tween the passages 171, 174 upon movement of valve member 168 . The fixed valve member 167 includes purging openings 192 which communicate with the pas sage 177 as the valve member 168 is moved to open the valve. In use air under pressure is supplied to the chamber 164 and passes through the purging openings to purge the valve 36 and ensure that the radioactive waste does not leak from the valve. The valve members 166, 7, 8 are urged into sealing engagement by springs 178 and a bellows type seals 186, 7 provide a con nection between conduit 34 and the valve 36 which allows limited relative movement of the conduit and the valve.
