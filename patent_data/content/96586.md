## Description
This invention relates generally to the art of genetic engineering and, more particularly, to improved plasmids by which copy number may be controlled by temperature, and to improved strains carrying such plasmids. Organisms containing such plasmids have been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection ATCC 39142 . Naturally occurring plasmids exist in host cells in a stable and characteristic copy number per host chromosome. This copy number is typically fairly constant although some variation may exist from host to host and may be affected by certain physiological phenomena such as culture growth rate, growth history, etc. One of the factors which govern the copy number of a given plasmid in a host cell line is the plasmid s own replication system. Plasmid mutants have been isolated in which the copy number is far higher than that typically found in naturally occurring or wild type organisms. Although not fully understood, such high copy number mutants are believed to exist as a result of an altered repressor mechanism. Stable high copy number mutants are shown and described in European Patent No. 0013830. Assuming that the expression mechanisms of the host cells are viable, the existence of high copy number plasmids can also provide a corresponding increase in the production of proteins encoded by genes on those plasmids. Thus, the use of high copy number plasmids in genetic engineering affords a means by which the product yield of heterologous genes carried by such plasmids may be increased. Under some circumstances, the production of large amounts of protein product of a heterologous gene can have a deleterious affect on the host organism. Under such circumstances, the ability to produce large amounts of the desired protein product may be impaired, particularly in large scale industrial fermentation processes. Thus, it is desirable to find a means for controlling the level of production of heterologous gene products in genetically engineered microorganisms. Expression promoter mechanisms are known which may be controlled, for example by the addition or depletion of a particular substance. Such a promoter mechanism may be employed in connection with high copy number mutants in order to delay production of a heterologous gene product until the host cultures have had an opportunity to grow to a desired maturity. However, on an industrial scale, such method of expression control may be undesirable because of the necessity of providing large amounts of inducer to the culture, or removing large amounts of inducer from the culture, at the desired time. Moreover, host cells in which high copy number plasmids exist are essentially sick and may not thrive as well as hoped under industrial conditions. Plasmids have been described whose replication systems are temperature sensitive. Thus, the plasmids may exist in low copy number at one temperature, and at another temperature may replicate rapidly to a very high or even a runaway copy number. Such plasmids afford a desirable technique for switching on the production of heterologous gene products, not through the expression mechanism as above described, but through the replication mechanism. Thus, host cell cultures may be grown under conditions designed to foster growth without experiencing an unusually high production of the heterologous gene product encoded for by the genetically engineered plasmid. Once a desired growth level is reached, the production of the heterologous gene product may be greatly increased or switched on by altering the temperature to cause high copy replication of the temperature sensitive plasmids. Although several temperature sensitive copy number plasmids are known in the prior art, such plasmids may not be desirable in certain circumstances, particularly in large scale industrial applications. This is because many of such prior art plasmids may not be stable, may require enriched media for proper amplification, or may require extensive growth of the host microorganism in log phase before satisfactory amplification may be achieved with temperature shift. In addition, some of the prior art plasmids which are temperature sensitive copy number plasmids require repeated growth dilution phases before amplification may be achieved. According to the invention there is provided a stable recombinant plasmid having the following characteristics FIGURE 1 is a restriction map of the plasmid designated pOP9 used in the preparation of the plasmid of the invention FIGURE 2 is a restriction map of the plasmid designated as pEW27 used in the preparation of a plasmid of the invention and FIGURE 3 is a restriction map of a plasmid designated pCS3 constructed in accordance with the invention. Very generally, the stable high copy number plasmids of the invention have ColEl type parentage and undergo substantial intracellular replication in a host upon a substantial increase in temperature. More particularly, the plasmids of the invention are produced by incorporating portions of known ColEl derivative plasmids to produce the particularly exceptional characteristics of the plasmids of the invention. The plasmids may be relatively small less than six kilobases and have a fragment containing mutations which provide the temperature sensitive copy number characteristics. Naturally, the plasmids are also provided with a suitable site for the insertion of heterologous DNA and either contain suitable promoters to provide expression of such heterologous DNA, or provide for the insertion of such promoters along with the heterologous DNA. A particularly suitable construction in accordance with the invention is shown in the drawings in FIGURE 3. This construction has been derived from the two plasmids shown in FIGURES 1 and 2. The plasmid shown in FIGURE 1 is a ColEl derivative prepared as described below in accordance with known genetic engineering techniques. The plasmid shown in FIGURE 2, pEW27, is a plasmid shown and described by Wong, E.M., Muesing, M.A., Polisky, B., The plasmid of the invention shown in FIGURE 3 was constructed by incorporating the fragment extending from the The remaining portion of the plasmid in FIGURE 3 was provided from the plasmid in FIGURE 2 and was the fragment from the In engineering a preferred form of the plasmid of the invention, a ColEl type plasmid, pOP6 or pOPl 6 was utilized. This plasmid is described in Gelfand, D.H., Shepard, H.M., O Farrell, P.H., Polisky, B., A 3.3 kb fragment of pOP6 was first deleted. To do this, 50 micrograms of pOP6 DNA was digested to completion with 20 units 15 min each of restriction endonucleases In order to eliminate to the 0.26 pMoles of The polymerase treated DNA was deproteinized with phenol and ethanol precipitated. In order to maximize intramolecular blunt end ligation 0.1 pMole of the digested and repaired DNA was ligated in a 50 microliters reaction volume containing 50 mM Tris Cl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl₂, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 100 micrograms ml crystalline bovine serum albumin, 500 mM ATP and 0.1 units T4 DNA ligase at 20 C for 2 hours. 0.02 pMole 100 mg of the ligated DNA was used to transform competent DG75 O Farrell, P.H., Polisky, B., Gelfand, D.H., One candidate, designated pOP7, was chosen and the 25 micrograms of pOP7 DNA were digested to completion with 20 units In order to repair the 5 This pOP8 was then modified to result in pOP9. To do this, the To repair the 78 micrograms of DNA was digested to completion with 100 units Then, the Following deproteinization with phenol and ethanol precipitation, each partial pOP8 Ligation and transformation of 1.42 kb Competent DG75 was transformed with 5 microliters of the ligation mix, and transformants were selected on ampicillin 50 micrograms ml or ampicillin 50 micrograms ml and tetracycline 15 micrograms ml containing plates. Candidates Tc In order to accomplish conversion of pOP9 50 micrograms pEW27 DNA was digested to completion with 0.36 micrograms .327 pMoles pEW27 fragment and 0.35 micrograms 0.16 pMoles pOP9 fragment were ligated in 20 microliter containing 50 mM Tris Cl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl₂, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM ATP, 100 micrograms ml bovine serum albumin and 0.1 unit T4 DNA ligase for 16 hours at 15 C. MM294 was transformed with 1 2 of the ligated DNA and ampicillin tetracycline resistant transformants selected. Candidate colonies were initially screened at 30 C and 41 C on beta lactamase assay plate and then for plasmid DNA levels following growth at 30 C and 41 C. One candidate was designated pCS3. Plasmid pCS3 is deposited with the American Type Culture Collection under accession number ATCC 39142. The plasmids of the invention exist at a low copy number 15 20 at 30 C. At 40 C, even though the host cells themselves do not grow or replicate additionally, the plasmids multiply to 150 400 copies per chromosome per cell with consequent amplification of any products of heterologous genes cloned into such plasmids. The plasmid of the invention is relatively small in size and therefore less likely to suffer spontaneous deletions than larger plasmids. As an example, the plasmids of the invention may be utilized in a process in which the trp promoter beta interferon Transfer of The To prepare the pCS3 vector, 50 micrograms pCS3 were digested to completion with Fragment ligation and transformation was the performed, 0.6 micrograms of digested vector and 0.2 micrograms of purified target fragment were ligated in 10 microliters containing 50 mM Tris Cl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl₂, 10 mM dithiothroitol, 100 micrograms ml bovine serum albumin and 0.001 unit T4 DNA ligase for 12 hours at 10 C. The ligated DNA was heated to 65 for 10 minutes, NaCl added to 100 mM and 3 units The plasmids of the invention, because of their ColEl type parentage, have an absolute requirement for the enzyme DNA polymerase I and will not replicate in a Pol Al DNA polymerase I lacking host Kingsbury D.T., Helinski, D.R., It may be seen, therefore, that the invention provides stable high copy number temperature sensitive plasmids with ColEl type parentage. The plasmids are temperature sensitive relatively small in size, and a substantial amplification of copy number occurs upon a temperature shift from, for example, 30 C to 40 C. Various modifications within the scope of the invention in addition to those shown and described herein will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description and accompanying drawings.
