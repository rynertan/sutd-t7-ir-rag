# Video signal processing cicuits.

## Abstract
A video signal processing circuit comprising means 41, 43 for supplying input sample data relating to sample posi tions in a video field and in association with the sample data for each sample position associated z data indicating the apparent position of the sample data in a direction perpendicular to a video display of the video field, a first memory 30 for storing the sample data relating to each sample position in the video field, a second memory 31 for storing the z data relating to each sample position in the video field, and a comparator circuit 46 for comparing for each sample position in the video field the value of the input said data with the z data for that sample position stored in the second memory 31 and for supplying a write enable signal only if the value of the input Z data repre sents a sample position in front of that represented by the stored said data, the input sample data being written into the first memory 30 and the new z data being written into the sec ond memory 31 under control of the write enable signal.
