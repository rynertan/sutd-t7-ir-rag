# Digital phase comparing apparatus.

## Abstract
A digital phase comparator, to be used in a phase locked loop, for example, comprises a first and second input signal terminals receiving a first and second input signals, respec tively, the phases of which are to be compared, and a pair of first 710 and second 720 delay flip flops. The first input signal terminal is connected to a clock terminal CL1 of the first delay flip flop and a reset or set terminal R2 of the second delay flip flop. The second input terminal is connected to a set or reset terminal R1 of the first delay flip flop and a clock terminal CL2 of the second delay flip flop. An inverted or non inverted output terminal of the first delay flip flop is connected to a day terminal D2 of the second delay flip flop. An inverted or non inverted output terminal of the second delay flip flop is connected to a data terminal D1 of the first delay flip flop. An output signal associated with the phase difference between the first and second input signals is obtained from the output terminals of the first and second delay flip flops.
