# Polymer composition.

## Abstract
A polyaryletherketone composition has a pliability which is such that a wire coated with the composition has a recoil of not more than 40 . Compositions having such pliability include those containing a polyaryletherketone and boron nitride. The polyaryletherketone can be polyaryletheretherketone. The composition can be obtained by blending together the polymer and boron nitride, and the blend can be extruded onto an electrical conductor. When extruded onto a wire, the com position gives a more pliable coated wire than is obtained using the polymer alone as the wire coating. The composition gives a coherent coating when coated onto a wire. The com position is also suitable for the production of bearings or bearing liners.

## Description
Polymer Composition The present invention relates to polymer compositions, and the production and use of such compositions. Polymeric materials are now extensively used for many purposes and in recent years polymers have become available which have high melting or softening points which make them suitable for use at higher temperatures than are attainable using the longer established polymeric materials. Polyarylether derivatives such as polyaryletherketones are examples of such polymers which, in addition to having high service temperatures have other desirable properties such as electrical insulation characteristics. Polyaryletherketones have good electrical insulating properties and high melting or softening temperatures.Some polymers of this type can be used as an electrical insulator continuously at temperatures in excess of 2000C, for example up to about 250 C. However it will be appreciated that the period of use at elevated temperature is dependent on the temperature and decreases as the temperature is increased. Although the polyaryletherketones have got properties which make them suitable for use as high temperature electrical insulators, many of these polymers have a high flexural modulus and hence may not be entirely suitable for use as a wire coating if the coated wire requires pliability. It has been found that certain additives, for example fluorinated ethylene propylene copolymers and ethylene tetrafluoroethylene copolymers, can improve the pliability of the polymer.However, when compositions containing these additives are used for wire coating, the coating shows reduced coherency and had a tendency to crack or even fall apart. According to the present invention there is provided a polyaryletherketone composition which has a pliability which is such that a copper wire of mean diameter 1 mm, when coated with the composition to give a coating of 0.25 mm average thickness,shows a recoil, after bending through 90 , of not more than 40 . Pliability is determined by bending annealed, coated wires over a 6 mm diameter mandrel. The load applied is increased until it is sufficient to bend the coated wire through 900. The amount of recoil is measured after removing, from the coated wire, the minimum load required to bend the coated wire through 90 . For convenience hereafter, the foregoing procedure will be referred to as the recoil test . We have found that the amount of recoil is influenced by the load applied in order to bend the coated wire. Accordingly, the amount of recoil is measured using the minimum load to bend the coated wire through 90 . The recoil test is effected at ambient temperature conditions, which are typically from 15 C up to 300C. Depending on the composition, the load required to bend the coated wire through 90a may be one kilogra e or greater. However, with some compositions in accordance with the present invention the minimum load is less than one kilogramrae and may be 0.5 kilogramme or even less.Prefered compositions provide coherent coatings on the wire and are suitable for use at temperatures in excess of 200 C for continuous periods of many weeks. We have found that compositions having these properties are produced by the addition of boron nitride to the polyaryletherketone. Thus, according to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a polymer composition which comprises a mixture of a polyaryletherketone with boron nitride. The composition may include other components which are suitable for incorporation into a polyaryletherketone. Such other components include, for example, inorganic and organic fibrous fillers such as glass fibre, carbon fibre and poly paraphenylene terephthalamide fibre organic and inorganic fillers such as polytetrafluoroethylene, graphite, mica, talc and vermiculite and stabilisers such as phosphates. It is preferred that the total proportion of additives including boron nitride is at least 1X, and does not exceed 70 , by weight of the composition and especially does not exceed 50 by weight of the composition. The composition preferably contains from 5 up to 30 by weight of boron nitride relative to the total weight of the composition. Compositions in accordance with the present invention include compositions consisting essentially of 70 to 95 by weight of the polyaryletherketone and correspondingly 30 to 5 by weight of boron nitride. The polyaryletherketone component of the polymer composition may be a polymer which contains the repeat units EMI3.1 or the repeat unitsEMI3.2 alone or in conjunction with each other and or in conjunction with other repeat units. The other repeat units which may be present in the polyaryletherketone are typically of the general formula whereEMI3.3 A is a direct link, a sulphur atom, a divalent hydrocarbon radical or a group QAr Q n in whichQ is CO , S02 or 0 Q1 is CO , S02 or 0 Ar is a divalent aromatic radical and n is 0, 1, 2 or 3. In the formula III, if the group A is a divalent hydrocarbon radical it is typically a phenylene group or a dimethylmethylene group C CH3 2 . The aromatic radical Ar is preferably a divalent aromatic radical selected from phenylene, biphenylylene or terphenylylene. We prefer that the polyaryletherketone is a crystalline polymer containing the repeat units I. Especially preferred are such polymers which are tough and have an inherent viscosity of at least 0.7, as is described in more detail in our European Patent PublicationNo. 001 879. Inherent viscosity is measured at 250C on a solution of the polymer in concentrated sulphuric acid of density 1.84g cm 3, said solution containing 0.1g of polymer per 100cm3 of solution. As an alternative to inherent viscosity, an indication of the average molecular weight of the polymer may be obtained by measuring the melt viscosity of the polymer. Preferred polymers have a melt viscosity of at least 0.1 KNs m2, which corresponds to an inherent viscosity of 0.7.The melt viscosity is measured using a ram extruder fitted with a 3.175 mm x 0.5into die and operating at 400CC and a shear rate of 1000s1. The boron nitride is preferably of at least 99 purity.Preferably the boron nitride is in the form of a powder of small particle size, for example having a weight average particle size of not Bore than 10 micrometres, particularly not more than 5 micrometres. The polymer composition may be made by admixture of the two components plus any additional optional components in a suitable mixing machine to effect particle or melt blending. More specifically, the polyaryletherketone and boron nitride, in the form of dry powders or granules or mixtures thereof, can be mixed together using a suitable solids blending technique such as tumble blending or a high speed mixer. The blend thus obtained may be extruded into a lace which is chopped to give granules. The granules can be used to produce shaped articles by the use of a suitable forming operation, for example injection moulding or extrusion, to give a shaped article. The shaped article obtained from the polymer composition is preferably an electrical conductor on which the polymer composition is the insulating layer or is a sheath for one or more insulated conductors. If desired, the polymer composition can be used both as the insulating layer and the outer sheath. The formation of the insulating layer or outer sheath can be effected using standard wire coating conditions with the exception that the extruder is operated at a higher temperature than is usual with most plastics materials, for example at a barrel temperature of at least 3400C and preferably with a die temperature which is at least 375 C, and which may be in excess of 400 C. Wires insulated with a polymer composition of polyaryletherketone and boron nitride are more pliable than wires insulated with the polyaryletherketone only. Some of the compositions of the present invention have been found to have a lower coefficient of friction and a higher limiting PV value as defined in Notes to Table Seven than either the polymer alone or a blend of the polymer and the same proportion by weight of poly tetrafluoroethylene. Such a combination of properties makes the composition suitable for use in bearing applications. Thus, the polymer compositions may also be used as a bearing or as a bearing liner. Thus, as a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a plain bearing formed of a polymer composition as herein described or comprising a metal backing having a lining formed of a polymer composition as herein described. If the composition is used to form a plain bearing this may be done by injection moulding the composition onto the bearing.Alternatively, the composition may be extruded into the form of a rod, the centre of which is machined out to form the bearing. The composition may also be used as a bearing liner on a metal backing. The metal backing may be any suitable metal such as, for example, aluminium alloy or steel with a suitable surface layer to assist in bonding the lining to the backing. The lining may be a thick coating of 0.75 to 35mm in thickness but may be an overlay, for example of 10 to 30 micrometres, applied to a metal bearing lining.The polymer composition is preferably applied to the metal backing as a sheet. The polymer composition may be extruded to form a sheet and the sheet issuing from the extruder then bonded to the metal backing as a second stage of a single operation. Alternatively, a preformed sheet of the polymer composition is presssure bonded or roll bonded to a heated metal backing. The temperature of bonding the polymer composition to the metal backing is preferably sufficiently high that the composition can flow under the conditions of bonding to the backing and typically the temperature is at least 350 C. The coated backing is preferably allowed to cool slowly from the temperature of bonding to ambient temperature to permit the polyaryletherketone component of the polymeric composition to attain a high crystallinity, for example at least 30 . The polymer composition also has improved burning characteristics compared to the respective polymer alone. More specifically, the polymer composition has a higher oxygen index compared to the respective polymer alone. The present invention is illustrated by the following examples and test results. Example I Boron nitride obtained from Borax Consolidated BoridesDivision, Lake Road, Newport Industrial Estate, Gwent, NPT OSR, Great Britain and polyetheretherketone rVictrexf RegisteredTrade Mark PEEK aromatic polymer 450 P grade, obtainable fromImperial Chemical Industries PLC were dry mixed by tumble blending for 15 minutes in the proportions of 15Z by weight of boron nitride and 85Z by weight of polyetheretherketone. The blend was then formed into granules by extrusion into a lace which was cooled by passing into a water bath and the lace was then cut to form granules. The extrusion was effected using a single screw Plaston extruder having a 3.8cm diameter screw with a length to diameter ratio of 24 1 and having the following temperature profile from the hopper end to the die 3450C, 360 C, 365 C, 370 C and 380 C. The die was of 5 mm diameter and the extruder was operated at a rate of about 5kg hour. Examples 2 and 3 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated using different proportions of boron nitride to give compositions containing 5 by weight of boron nitride Example 2 and 10 by weight of boron nitride Example 3 The composition of Example 1 was coated onto a lmm diameter copper wire using an 18mm Bone extruder fitted with a Betol designed tubing wire coating die with total diameter of 1.5mm. The wire was passed through the die at a rate of about 15m minute and the extruder was operated at a rate of about 1.6kg hour to give a coating of average thickness 0.25mm. The die temperature for wire coating was about 400 C. For the purposes of comparison, samples of the copper wire were also coated with the polymer polyetheretherketone alone. The coated wires were then subjected to tests of continuous use temperature, solvent resistance and pliability and the results of these tests are set out in Tables One to Three respectively.

The pads were the test specimens of 10mmx10mmx3.0 t0.5 mm described previously. The ring was 60mm in diameter and 6mm wide and was formed of EN8 steel ground to a surface finish of 0.3 to 0.4 micrometers Ra.
