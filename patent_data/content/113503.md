# Three phase power factor controller with induced EMF sensing.

## Abstract
A power factor controller for an A.C. induction motor 10 comprises thyristor switches 110, 111 and 112 connected in series with the motor, phase detectors 122, 124, and 126 for sensing the motor current and voltage and providing an output proportional to the phase difference between the motor voltage and current, and a control circuit, responsive to the output of the phase detector and to a power factor command signal, for controlling switching of the thyristor. The invention involves sensing the induced EMF produced by the motor during the time interval when the thyristor is off and for producing a corresponding feedback signal for controlling switching of the thyristor. The sensed EMF is also used to enhance soft starting of the motor.
