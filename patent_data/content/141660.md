# Microcomputer.

## Abstract
A microcomputer comprising memory 60 and a process is arranged to execute a plurality of concurrent processes and share its time between them. The microcomputer in cludes as register 51 for indicating a current process as well as a collection of processes awaiting execution. Each process has a memory location 66 to provide an indication of a next process in a linked list of processes. Each process has an allocated priority and a separate linked list is formed for each priority. A register 53 indicates the front of one list and a further register 52 indicates the end of that list.
