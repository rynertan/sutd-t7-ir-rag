# Method and apparatus for testing ready mixed concrete.

## Abstract
Concrete with a known cement mixing ratio is sampled and the aggregate is screened out. A fixed quantity of the resulting mortar is weighed, stirred with water and allowed to stand. The mortar sample is then immersed in water and again weighed. A linear relationship between the water to cement ratio of the concrete and the ratio of the weight of the mortar under water to that out of water then allows the water to cement ratio w c to be read off from a graph. This then serves as a measure of the quality of the hardened concrete. An apparatus for carrying out the method automatically is also described.
