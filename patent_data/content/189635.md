## Description
This invention relates to hydrotreating processes using self promoted molybdenum and tungsten sulphide catalysts. More particularly, this invention relates to hydrotreating processes using self promoted molybdenum and tungsten sulphide hydrotreating catalysts produced by heating one or more water soluble molybdate and or tungstate catalyst precursors containing the promoter metal as part of the precursor molecule in the presence of sulphur at elevated temperature for a time sufficient to form said catalyst. The petroleum industry is increasingly turning to coal, tar sands, heavy crudes and resids as sources for future feedstocks. Feedstocks derived from these heavy materials contain more sulfur and nitrogen than feedstocks derived from more conventional crude oili. Such feedstocks are commonly referred to as being dirty feeds. These feeds, therefore, require a considerable amount of upgrading in order to obtain usable products therefrom, such upgrading or refining generally being accomplished by hydrotreating processes which are well known in the industry. These processes require the treating with hydrogen of various hydrocarbon fractions, or whole heavy feeds, or feedstocks, in the presence of hydrotreating catalysts to effect conversion of at least a portion of the feed or feedstock to lower molecular weight hydrocarbons, or to effect the removal of unwanted components or compounds, or their conversion to innocuous or less undesirable compounds. Hydrotreating may be applied to a variety of feedstocks, e.g., solvents, light, middle or heavy distillate feeds and residual feeds or fuels. In hydrotreating relatively light feeds the feeds are treated with hydrogen, often to improve odor, color, stability, combustion characteristics, and the like. Unsaturated hydrocarbons are hydrogenated and saturated. Sulfur and nitrogen are removed in such treatments.In the treatment of catalytic cracking feedstocks the cracking quality of the feedstock is improved primarily by the removal of nitrogen and hydrogenation. Carbon yield is reduced and gasoline yield is generally increased. In the hydrodesulfurization of heavier feedstocks or residua, the sulfur compounds are hydrogenated and cracked. Carbonsulfur bonds are broken and the sulfur, for the most part, is converted to hydrogen sulfide, which is removed as a gas from the process. Hydrodenitrogenation, to some degree, also generally accompanies hydrodesulfurization reactions. In the hydrodenitrogenation of heavier feedstocks or residua, the nitrogen compounds are hydrogenated and cracked. Carbon nitrogen bonds are broken and the nitrogen is converted to ammonia and evolved from the process. Hydrodesulfurization, to some degree, also generally accompanies hydrodesulfurization reactions.In the hydrodesulfurization of relatively heavy feedstocks emphasis is on the removal of sulfur from the feedstock. In the hydrohydrodenitrogenation of relatively heavy feedstocks emphasis is on the removal of nitrogen from the feedstock. Albeit, although hydrodesulfurization and hydrodenitrogenation reactions generally occur together, it is usually far more difficult to achieve effective hydrodenitrogenation of feedstocks than hydrodesulfurization of feedstocks. Catalysts most commonly used for these hydrotreating reactions include materials such as cobalt molybdate on alumina, nickel on alumina, cobalt molybdate promoted with nickel, nickel tungstate, etc. Also, it is well known to those skilled in the art to use certain transition metal sulfides, such as cobalt and molybdenum sulfides and mixtures thereof, to upgrade oils containing sulfur and nitrogen compounds by catalytically removing such compounds in the presence of hydrogen, which processes are collectively known as hydrotreating or hydrorefining processes, it being understood that hydrorefining also includes some hydrogenation of aromatic and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons. Thus, U. S. Patent No. 2,914,462 discloses the use of molybdenum sulfide for hydrodesulfurizing gas oil and U. S.Patent No. 3,148,135 discloses the use of molybdenum sulfide for hydrorefining sulfur and nitrogen containing hydrocarbons oils. U. S. PatentNo. 2,715,603 discloses the use of molybdenum sulfides for producing sulfur free hydrogen and carbon dioxide, wherein the molybdenum sulfide converts carbonyl sulfide to hydrogen sulfide. Molybdenum and tungsten sulfides have other uses as catalysts, including hydrogenation, methanation, water gas shift, etc. reactions. In general, with molybdenum and other transition metal sulfide catalysts, as well as with other types of catalysts, higher catalyst surface areas generally result in more active catalysts than similar catalysts with lower surface areas. Thus, those skilled in the art are constantly trying to achieve catalysts that have higher surface areas. More recently, it has been disclosed in U. S. Patent Nos.4,243,553 and 4,243,554 that molybdenum sulfide cata lysts of relatively high surface are may be obtained by thermally decomposing selected thiomolybdate salts at temperatures ranging from 300 8000C in the presence of essentially inert, oxygen free atmospheres. Suitable atmospheres are disclosed as consisting of argon, a vacuum, nitrogen and hydrogen. In U. S. Patent No. 4,243,554 an ammonium thiomolybdate salt is decomposed at a rate in excess of 150C per minute, whereas in U. S. Patent No. 2,243,553 a substituted ammonium thio molybdate salt is thermally decomposed at a very slow heating rate of from about 0.5 to 20C per minute. The processes disclosed in these patents are claimed to produce molybdenum disulfide catalysts having superior properties for water gas shift and methanation reac tions and for catalyzed hydrogenation or hydrotreating reactions. This invention relates to a hydroprocessing process comprising contacting a hydrocarbon feed, at an elevated temperature and in the presence of hydrogen, with a self promoted catalyst, preferably a supported self promoted catalystoobtained by heating one or more water soluble catalyst precursors of the formula ML MoyW1 yOq in a non oxidizing atmosphere in the presence of sulphur at an elevated temperature, preferably of at least about 150 C especially of at least about 200 C for a time sufficient to form said catalyst, wherein M comprises one or more divalent promoter metals preferably selected from Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and mixtures thereof wherein y is any value ranging from 0 to 1 and wherein L is one or more neutral, nitrogen containing ligands at least one of which is a chelating polydentate ligand. In a particularly preferred embodiment ligand L will have a denticity of six and will be either three bidentate or two tridentate chelating alkyl amine ligands M will be selected from Ni, Fe, Co and mixtures thereof and the non oxidizing atmosphere will contain hydrogen sulfide as the source of sulfur. Hydroprocessing is meant to include any process that is carried out in the presence of hydrogen, including, but not limited to, hydrocracking, hydrodeni trogenation, hydrodesulfurization, hydrogenation of aromatic and aliphatic unsaturated hydrocar bonus methanation, water gas shift, etc. These reactions include hydrotreating and hydrorefining reactions, the difference generally being thought of as more of a difference in degree than in kind, with hydrotreating conditions being more severe than hydrorefining conditions. Some of the catalysts of this invention have hydrotreating or hydrorefining activities substantially greater than that of conventional hydrotreating catalysts, such as cobalt molybdate on alumina. The catalysts of this invention may be used in bulk form or supported on a suitable inorganic refractory oxide support, such as alumina. A particularly significant advantage of this invention is that the water solubility of the catalyst precursor permits the precursor to be impregnated onto a suitable support, such as alumina, via conventional impregnation techniques, such as incipient wetness and adsorption. As hereinbefore stated, the catalyst precursor is a water soluble metallate having the formulaEMI6.1 tb ML MoyWl yO SEP wherein tb M is one of more divalent prometer metals selected from Mn,Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and mixtures thereof. Preferably, M will be selected from a Ni,Co, Fe and mixtures thereof and b mixtures of a with Zn, Cu, MnEMI6.2 mixtures thereof. Still more preferably, M will be selected from Fe, Ni, Co and mixtures thereof. Thus, the promoter metal may be a single metal, such as Ni, in which case the precursor will have the formula NiL MOyWlyO4 . Alternatively, the promoter metal may be a mixture of two, three, four, five or even six promoter metals. For the case of two promoter metals, such as Ni and Co, the precursor will have the formula NiaCo1 a L MoyW1 yO4 wherein O a l. In the case of three promoter metals, such as Ni, Co and Zn, the precursor will have the formula of the form NiaCObZnc L1 MOyWlyO4 wherein 0 a, bEMI6.3 c l and a b c 1. Where there are four metals, such as Fe,Ni, Co and Zn, the precursor will have the formula FeaNibCocZnd L1 MoyWly04 , wherein 0 a, b, cEMI6.4 tb r tb SEP 2y SEP d tb 1 and a b c d 1, and so on. The precursor may be a self promoted molybdate, tungstate or combination thereof. If it is only a molybdate it is obvious that y will have a value of 1.Alternatively, if the precursor is a tungstate y will be zero. The ligand L will, generally, have a denticity of six and will be one or more neutral, nitrogen containing ligands wherein at least one of said ligands is a multidentate chelating ligand which chelates the promoter metal cation to form a chelated promoter metal cation ML 2 . Thus, the catalytic metal oxide anion MoyWl yo4 2 will be ionically bound to the chelated promoter metal cation ML 2 . By neutral is meant that the ligand itself does not have a charge. Those skilled in the art know that the term ligand is used to designate functional coordinating groups which have one or more pairs of electrons available for the formation of coordinate bonds. Ligands that can form more than one bond with a metal ion are called polydentate, while ligands that can form only one bond with a metal ion are called monodentate. Monodentate ligands are not capable of forming chelates.Hence, if one uses one or more species of monodentate ligands in the precursor molecule then one must also use at least one polydentate chelating ligand. Preferably, L will be one or more polydentate chelating ligands. The denticity of the ligand L will generally be six, because the promoter metal cations prefer sixfold coordination. Hence, if more than one species of ligand is employed in the precursor molecule the denticity of the ligand species will usually add up to six. It should be understood that it is possible for ligand L to have a total denticity of less than six, but in most cases L will have a total denticity of six.Thus, L will be three bidentate ligands, two tridentate ligands, a mixture of a bidentate and a quadridentate ligand, a hexadentate ligand or a mixture of a polydentate ligand with monodentate ligands as long as the combination has a total denticity of six. As has heretofore been stated, it is preferred to use. chelating bidentate and tridentate ligands. In general, the ligands useful in this invention include alkyl and aryl amines and nitrogen heterocycles. Illustrative, but non limiting, examples of ligands useful in the catalyst precursors of this invention are set forth below. Monodentate ligands will include NH3, as well as alkyl and aryl amines, such as ethyl amine, dimethyl amine, pyridine, etc. Useful chelating bidentate amine ligands are illustrated by ethylenediamine, 2,2 bipyridine, l,10 phenylene bis dimethyl amine , o phenylene diamine, tetramethylethylenediamine and propane 1,3 diamine. Similarly, useful chelating tridentate amine ligands are represented by terpyridine and diethylene triamine, while triethylenetetramine is illustrative of a useful chelating quadradentate amine ligand. Useful chelating pentadentate ligands include tetraethylenepentamine, while sepulchrate an octazacryptate is illustrative of a suitable chelating hexadentate ligand. As a practical matter, it will be preferred to use chelating, polydentate alkyl amines for L.Illustrative, but not limiting, examples of alkyl amines that are useful in the catalyst precursor of this invention include ethylenediamine, diethylenediamine and tetraethylenetetramine. It is particularly preferred to use bidentate and tridentate alkyl amines, such as ethylenediamine and diethylenetriamine. In qeneral, the precursor salts useful for used in toe process forming the catalystsòf this invention may be prepared by mixing an aqueous solution of ammonium molybdate and or tungstate with an aqueous solution of the chelated promoter metal cation ML 2 which, in the presence of excess metallate, ligand and or chelated promoter metal cation, will result in the formation of the precursor salt as a precipitate which is readily recovered. The chelating promoter cation is easily formed by, for example, mixing an aqueous solution of one or more water soluble promoter metal salts with the ligand. The water soluble salt may be any water soluble salt that is convenient to use, such as a halide, sulfate, perchlorate, acetate, nitrate, etc.Alternatively, an aqueous solution of ammonium molybdate and or tungstate may be mixed with the ligand with the resulting solution mixed with an aqueous solution of promoter metal salt or the salt can be added to the ligand and dissolved into solution of molybdate and or tungstate. The catalyst precursor preparation will be further understood by reference to the Examples, infra. The catalysts useful in the process of this invention may be used in bulk or supported on a suitable support, preferably supported on a suitable inorganic refractory oxide support, such as alumina. As previously stated, an advantage of the catalyst precursors useful in this invention resides in their water solubility which permits them to be supported on suitable support materials by techniques well known in the art, such as impregnation, incipient wetness and the like, the choice being left to the convenience of the practitioner. When using the impregnation technique, the aqueous impregnating solution will be contacted with the support for a time sufficient to deposit the precursor material onto the support, either by selective adsorption or, alternatively, the excess water may be evaporated during drying, leaving behind the precursor salt. Advantageously, the incipient wetness techniques may be used whereby just enough of an aqueous precursor salt solution is added to dampen and fill the pores of the support. used in the process The catalysts of this invention may be prepared by heating one or more catalyst precursor salts, bulk or supported, in the presence of sulfur in a non oxidizing atmosphere, at a temperature of at least about 2000C for a time sufficient to form the catalyst. Preferably, the sulfur required during the formation of the catalyst may be present in the form of sulfur bearing compound in an amount in excess of that required to form the catalyst. Thus, it is preferred that the catalyst be formed by heating the precursor in the presence of sulfur or, preferably, in the presence of a sulfur bearing compound which can be one or more solids, liquids, gases or mixtures thereof. Thus, the catalyst will be formed by heating the precursor in the presence of sulfur or a sulfur bearing compound.Mixtures of hydrogen and H2S have been found to be particularly suitable. Preferably, the temperature will range between from about 250 6000C, more preferably from about 250 5000C, and still more preferably from about 300 4000C. The non oxidizing atmosphere may be inert or net reducing. As discussed previously molybdenum and tungsten sulfide catalysts have many uses, including hydrotreating. Hydrotreating conditions vary considerably depending on the nature of the hydrocarbon being hydrotreated, the nature of the impurities or contaminants to be reacted or removed, and, inter alia, the extent of conversion desired, if any. In general, however, the following are typical conditions for hydrotreating a naphtha boiling within a range of from about 250C to about 2100C, a diesel fuel boiling within a range of from about 170 3500C, a heavy gas oil boiling within the range of from about 3250C to about 4750C, a lubricating oil feed boiling within a range of from about 290 5500C, or residuum containing from about 10 percent to about 50 percent of material boiling above about 5750C.

An aqueous solution of nickel chloride was slowly added, in aliquots, to the above solution with agitation after the addition of each aliquot. A precipitate was formed and recovered by vacuum filtration. This precipitate was Ni en 3MoO4 and was washed with distilled water and acetone and then dried in a vacuum oven at 500C for three hours.The resulting cake was screened, pelletized, sized to 20 40 mesh Tyler . More speci fically, 20.5 grams of NH4 6Mo7024.4H20 ammonium heptamolybdate was added to 500 ml. of ethylene diamine en in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask.This amount of en was in excess of that stoichiometrically required to form the precursor and the excess aided in precipitating same from solution. From 40 to 50cc of distilled H20 was used twice to wash off any solid of solution remaining on the sides of the flask. The resulting solution was cooled to OOC in an ice bath and kept in the bath for the duration of the preparation. In a separate flask 27 grams of NiC12.6H2O were dissolved into 300 milliliters of distilled H20. This Ni2 solution was added slowly, in aliquots, to the NH4 2MoO4 en aqueous solution with agitation after each addition. A precipitate formed immediately. This precipitate was separated out by vacuum filtration through a Buchner funnel. The product, Ni en 3MoO4, was washed with distilled H2O, then with ethanol, and dried under vacuum for 16 24 hours. 46.0 grams of Ni en 3MoO4 were recovered. This same procedure was used for the preparation of Co en 3MoO4, except that an appropriate amount of CoC12.6H2O was used instead of NiC12.6H20. To form a supported catalyst, 43 grams of Co en 3MoO4 were dissolved into 140 cc of distilled water. Sixty grams of a reforming grade of d A1203 Englehard Industries , which had been calcined overnight at 5000C, were impregnated with this solution via the incipient wetness technique using four successive aliquots. After each aliquot was added to the alumina support the impregnate was dried under vacuum about 1000C for six hours. The final impregnate was ground and pelletized using a 4 aqueous solution of polyvinyl alcohol was a binder. The bulk Ni en 3MoO4 was also pelletized using the same technique. Finally, another sample of CO en 3MoO4 was prepared and pelletized as above in bulk. The pelletized catalyst precursors were placed into a stainless steel reactor at 1000C at atmospheric pressure where they were purged for one hour under nitrogen. Ten percent of hydrogen sulfide in hydrogen was introduced into the reactor at a space velocity of 0.75 SCF hr for each lOcc of catalyst in the reactor. The temperature in the reactor was then raised to 325 3500C and kept at this temperature for one to three hours to form the catalyst after which the temperature in the reactor was lowered to 1000C, the H2 S H2 gas flow was stopped and the reactor was purged with nitrogen until room temperature was reached. Reaction Conditions At least about 20 cc of each catalyst was loaded into a stainless steel fixed bed reactor. The conditions in the reactor were as set forth below Temperature 3250C Pressure 3.15 MPa Hydrogen Rate 3,000 SCF bbl LHSV 2, 3 and 4 V V Hr.The liquid product was analyzed for sulfur by X ray flourescence and for nitrogen by combustion analysis. The feedstock used was a light catalytic cycle oil LCCO that was about 20 weight percent paraffinic having properties set forth in Table 1. In all of these experiments the results obtained from the catalysts of this invention were compared to results obtained for commercial HDS and HDN catalysts comprising cobalt molybdate onV A1203 and nickel molybdate on2 A1203, respectively. The cobalt molybdate comprised 12.5 percent molybdenum oxide and 3.5 percent cobalt oxide supported on the gamma alumina and the nickel molybdate comprised 18 percent molybdenum oxide and 3.5 percent nickel oxide on gamma alumina. These commercial catalysts were sulfided employing the same procedure used to form the catalysts of this invention, except that the temperature was 3600C for one hour. Example 1 In this experiment the LCCO feed was hydrotreated at an LHSV of 2 comparing two of the catalyst of this invention to the commercial cobalt molybdate on alumina HDS catalyst. The results are set forth inTable 2.Example 2 This experiment was the same as in.Example 1, except that the LHSV was 3. The results are shown in Table 3.Example 3 In this experiment the unsupported catalyst of this invention prepared from the CoXen 3MoO4 was compared to the commercial HDN catalyst, the results of which are shown in Table 4. These results show the remarkable HDN selectivity for the catalyst of this invention. The liquid hourly space velocity LHSV used in this invention was 4.

The Ni en 3MoO4 salt was prepared by dissolving 40.6 grams of ammonium paramolybdate in a mixture of 900 milliliters ethylenediamine en and 100 milliliters in a 2 liter round bottom, three neck flask.Next 56 grams of nickel chloride was dissolved in 100 milliliters H20 and transferred to a dropping funnel.While vigorously stirring the molybdate solution with an air driven stirrer, the nickel chloride solution was added to the flask via the dropping funnel. A violet powder precipitated. This precipitate was filtered, washed with acetone and then vacuum dried at 500C. 94.6 grams was obtained calculated yield 94 grams . Fifty grams of 19 Cr203 on A1203 in the form of 1 8 pellets Alfa Products Division of MortonThiokol, Inc. were calcined at 5000C for 3 hours and, after cooling, crushed to a 20 40 mesh powder. This powder was then placed in a 500 ml ROTOVAC flask. 45.8 grams of the Ni en 3MoO4 were dissolved in 120 milliliter of water and added to the flask. The flask was evacuated and rotated in a 700C water bath until the water was completely removed. The final impregnated solid weighed 104.6 grams. This impregnate was then ground, pelletized and sulfided at 3600C for one hour following the procedure in Examples 1 3. This catalyst gave a percentage of HDS of 70.5 and a percentage of HDN of 56.6 when tested with the LCCO feed at 3250C, 3.15 MPa and 3,000 SCF of hydrogen per barrel of oil at an LHSV of 3.0. Example 5 Twenty five grams of MgO in 20 40 mesh size were impregnated with 87.2 cc of solution containing 30.7 grams of Ni en 3MoO4. The resulting impregnate was vacuum dried at 500C overnight. The final impregnated solids weighed 61.6 grams. The final catalyst was sulfided at 4000C for one hour with a 10 H2S in hydrogen mixture, following the procedure for Examples 1 3. This catalyst gave a HDS of 58.1 and a HDN of 31.3 when tested with the LCCO feed at 3250C, 3.15 MPa and 3,000 SCF of hydrogen per barrel of oil at an LHSV of 3.0.
