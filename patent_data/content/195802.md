## Description
The present invention relates to enzymes. More particularly, it relates to a thermostable β Amylase. The food and beverage industries principally employ the enzyme, β amylase EC 3.2.1.41 , to convert starch into maltose solutions. β Amylase hydrolyzes the α 1,4 glucosidic linkages in an exo fashion from the non reducing end of starch type subtrates, and produces both maltose in the β anomeric configuration and β limit dextrins from starch. The β amylase employed in most industrial applications is obtained from plants Attempts have been made to obtain a more active, thermostable and extracellular enzyme from microorganisms. However, the known microbial β amylases are not active or thermostable enough to substitute for the plant enzyme. Therefore, the plant β amylases continue to be used for maltose production although they are expensive and relatively unstable. Only a few enzymes of current industrial interest have been isolated and characterized from thermoanaerobes. The thermostable and active enzymes characterized to date from thermoanaerobes, include an endoglucanase of The primary objects of the present invention are to disclose a thermostable β amylase and a method of producing that enzyme. We have discovered that the organism The β amylase is produced by culturing In the preferred method of the invention, the β amylase is produced by growing a pure culture of A detailed description of the preparation and characterization of the enzyme follows For determination of starch hydrolysis reaction on petri dishes, the organism was streaked in an anaerobic chamber onto plates of TYE medium that contained 1.0 soluble starch and 3.0 purified agar. The plates were placed into an anoxic paint can under nitrogen and incubated at 60 C for 4 days, The plates were removed from the paint can and flooded with iodine solution 1 I₂, and 2 KI in H₂O and hydrolysis zones were visually observed. The specific activity of the concentrated supernatant amylase solution was 60 units per mg protein. Cells were mass cultured and harvested for preparation of cell extracts by the same procedures as described above, except TYE medium supplemented with 0.5 soluble starch was employed. Cell extracts were prepared aerobically by suspending 3 g of wet cell paste in 12.5 ml of 20 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 6.0 . This suspension was treated at 37 C for 1 hr with 5 mg of lysozyme from chicken egg white and disrupted by passage through a French pressure cell at 20,000 lb in². The supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 30,000 x g for 30 min at 4 C. Protein concentration was determined. Reducing power was measured by the dinitrosalicylic acid method. For assay of pullulanase activity, the reaction mixture consisted of 0.5 ml of 2 pullulan in 0.2 M sodium acetate buffer pH 6.0 and 0.5 ml enzyme solution. After incubation at 60 C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by cooling on ice and by adding 4 ml of 3,5 dinitrosalicylic acid. One unit of amylase, β amylase or pullulanase is defined as the amount of enzyme that produced 1 µmol of reducing sugar as a glucose standard per min under the above conditions. Glucoamylase activity was assayed by incubating 1 ml of reaction mixture that contained 1 soluble starch, 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer pH 4.8 and the appropriately diluted enzyme solution at 60 C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped immediately by cooling on ice and then by boiling in a steam bath for 10 min. These reaction mixtures were centrifuged to remove the insoluble precipitates, and then released glucose was analyzed by the hexokinase and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase method. A unit of glucoamylase is defined as the amount of enzyme that produced one µmol of glucose per min under the assay conditions. Maltose was identified in the starch hydrolysates by high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC . The separation system consisted of a liquid chromatograph equipped with a data station, a refractive index detector and a oligosaccharide analysis column 300 x 7.8 mm fitted with a microguard pre column 40 x 4.6 mm . Starch hydrolysate samples were centrifuged at 5,000 x g and loaded onto the column 50 1 . Table 1 summarizes the results of experiments demonstrating the cellular location and types of different amylase activities in HPLC analysis of starch hydrolysates formed by extracellular amylase revealed that only maltose was produced as a detectable product in addition to high molecular weight oligosaccharides i.e., limit dextrins . In spite of prolonged incubation, only reducing sugars but not glucose were detected by quantatitive analysis of starch hydrolysates. Enzymatic hydrolysis of maltotriose and maltotetraose hydrolysis were also studied. Only maltose 8 mg ml was produced as a result of incubating 1 maltotetroase in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer with 12 units of the enzyme at 65 C for 3 hrs. Under these same conditions, enzymatic hydrolysis of maltotriose 1 yielded both glucose 0.4 mg ml and maltose. The release of reducing power and reduction of iodine staining capacity by action of the enzyme on amylase was determined. The slow decrease of blue value against reducing value in comparison with that of the α amylase control indicates that the enzyme is an exo acting amylase. From the mutarotation study, which employed α amylase as control, the upward shift of optical rotation upon the addition of base to the starch hydrolysate formed by the The effect of temperature on the stability of the β amylase in the absence of substrate also was determined. The enzyme was completely stable up to 70 C and 83 of the original activity was retained after treatment at 75 C for 1 hr. The enzyme was almost completely destroyed within 20 min at 80 C in the absence of starch, but addition of starch to the enzyme solution greatly enhanced the heat stability in proportion to the concentration of starch. The enzyme was entirely stable at 80 C in the presence of 5 starch. The effect of pH on β amylase activity and stability was determined. The optimum activity was observed at pH 5.5 to 6.0, and the activity dropped gradually at more alkaline or acid pH values. Higher than 43 of maximal activity was detected between pH values of 2.5 and 9.0. The enzyme was stable in the pH range of 3.5 to 6.5, but unstable below pH 3.0 and above pH 7.5. The effects of sulfhydryl reagents, metal ions and Schardinger dextrins α and β cyclodextrin on β amylase activity were examined. β Amylase activity was strongly inhibited by Cu The effects of ethanol on the enzyme activity and stability were also performed, β Amylase activity was not notably affected in the presence of 3 v v ethanol, but it dropped slowly in proportion to the concentration of ethanol at higher than 3 v v . In the presence of 10 v v ethanol, 65 of maximal activity was observed. This effect is attributed to the precipitation of starch substrate by ethanol because β amalyse was completely stable at 65 C for 1 hr in presence of 10 v v ethanol prior to activity analysis. In general, the foregoing data establish that The extracellular amylase was classifed as a β amylase based on certain criteria. The action of the enzyme on starch yielded only maltose as a detectable product besides high molecular weight limit dextrin, but not glucose or other low molecular maltosaccharides. Maltotetraose hydrolysis yielded only maltose, and maltotriose yielded glucose and maltose. The enzyme was inactive against pullulan, sucrose, cellobiose, trehalose, Schardinger dextrins and maltose. A large release of reducing power with relatively little reduction of the iodine staining capacity on hydrolysis of amylose and the upward mutarotation of starch digest upon the addition of alkali indicated that the enzyme acts in an exo fashion and produced maltose with the β anomeric configuration. In these respects, the extracellular amylase of The β amylase has industrial applications in the production of various sugar solutions or alcohols from starch because of its novel features. The enzyme is extracellular, a primary metabolite and it is active and stable at high temperature. The enzyme displays a high maximum temperature 75 C for enzyme activity and is stable up to 80 C in the presence of substrate. The β amylase is also active and stable at a wide range of pH. It has an optimal activity pH 5.5 6.0 , and stability pH 3.5 6.5 in the acidic range, which distinguishes it from most other β amylases that display optimal activity and stability around a neutral pH. The β amylase also may have novel applications for production of maltose syrups in conjunction with a pullulanase which is active at nearly the same pH and temperature range. β Amylases from higher plant and microorganisms are sulfhydryl enzymes and are inactivated by sulfhydryl reagents or oxidation. The present data indicates that The β amylase activity and stability was little affected by ethanol although growth of this species was very sensitive i.e., no growth in the presence of 2 ethanol . It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that β amylase productivity may be enhanced through mutation of the organism or by genetic recombination techniques. Therefore, the scope of the invention should not be limited to the specific strain of the organism described above because any organism capable of producing a thermostable β amylase similar to that produced by
