# Device and method for performing qualitative enzyme immunoassays.

## Abstract
A device for performing qualitative enzyme immunoassays comprises at least one tube 11 having antibody, antigen or hapten attached to an internal surface thereof. A first syringe 17 is connectable to a first end of the tube or tubes 11 and supplies a flow of test liquid therethrough. A second syringe 18 having a two piston arrangement 33, 35 is connected to the tube so as to allow a first wash solution followed by an enzyme conjugate solution to be flowed therethrough. Finally a third syringe 19 , also having a two piston configuration 33, 35 , is connected to the tube 11 so as to allow a second wash solution followed by an enzyme substrate and metabolite indicator solution to be flowed therethrough. The device can be used in a method in which the test liquid is flowed through the tube for about 1 minute, the first wash solution is then flowed through the tube followed by an enzyme conjugate solution, followed after an incubation period of at least one minute by a second wash solution and a solution containing enzyme substrate and enzyme metabolite indicator.
