# Seismic prospecting using a continuous shooting and continuous recording system.

## Abstract
A method of seismic prospecting is disclosed where in the seismic source 14 is excited in such a manner as to maximize the use of the energy 24 generated thereby. In certain cases it may be desirable to convert the received seismic signals to their frequency domain counterparts before performing subsequent processing. Such conversion may be performed using the discrete Fourier transform with the result that transformed values are obtained only at certain discrete frequencies. It may further be desirable that processing be performed only at subsets of the total set of discrete frequencies with values at the remaining frequencies being discarded. In the practice of the present invention, source energy is generated only at those discrete frequencies at wich subsequent processing is to be performed. As a result there is substantially no source energy in the transform values at the frequencies which are discarded.
