# SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORY DEVICE

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory device is comprised of mem ory cells 11₁₁ 11nm arranged in a matrix fashion defective row line detect circuits 24₁ 24n for producing logic 1 when a defective row line is selected to which a detective cell is connected defective column line detect circuits 29₁ 29m for producing a logical 1 signal when a defective column line is selected to which a defective cell is connected an AND gate 52 for detecting the selection of defective cell using a logic value of the output signals from defective row and column line detect circuits and an exclusive OR gate 22 for exclusively ORing the read out data signal and the output signal from the AND gate 52 to correct the defective data.
