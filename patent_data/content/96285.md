# Jaw chuck.

## Abstract
A multiple jaw chuck comprises a housing 2 and a drive cylinder 4 driven parallel to the longitudinal axis LA of the housing 2 and driving a plurality of chuck jaws 3 towards and away from the longitudinal axis LA of the housing. The chuck includes one or more axially extending pins 42 for each chuck jaw 3 fixed to the drive cylinder 4 at an acute angle to the longitudinal axis LA of the housing. Each chuck jaw 3 includes a bore 37 for each pin 42 and formed at the same acute angle, such that each chuck jaw 3 is driven radially towards and away from the longitudinal axis LA of the housing 2 when the drive cylinder 4 is driven parallel to the longitudinal axis LA . Each chuck jaw 3 includes an inner drive arm 31 coupled to the drive cylinder 4 , and an outer workpiece engaging arm 32 , each of the drive arms 31 being of substantially cylindrical configuration and movable in a bore 25 of corresponding cylindrical configuration formed in the housing 2 .
