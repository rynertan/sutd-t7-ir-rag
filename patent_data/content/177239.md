# ADAPTIVE FILTER INCLUDING SIGNAL PATH COMPENSATION

## Abstract
Impulse response estimation is improved in an adaptive filter 101 by compensating digital signals incoming to the filter to include a nonlinearity substantially identical to a nonlinearity 201 included in a return signal path 105, 106, 107 to the filter.
