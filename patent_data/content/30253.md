# SOLIDS MASS FLOW DETERMINATION

## Abstract
Method for determining the mass flow rate of solids mixed with a transport fluid to form a flowing mixture, wherein a temperature differential is established between the solids and fluid, the temperature of the transport fluid and the temperature of the solids prior to mixing, and the equilibrium temperature of the mixture are monitored and correlated in a heat balance with the heat capacities of the solids and fluid to determine the solids mass flow rate.
