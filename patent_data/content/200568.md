## Description
RFFRACTORY COMPOSITE MATERIAL AND METHOD OF PRODUCING MATERIAL This invention relates to refractory composite articles and to methods of producing such articles. In recent years, a large and growing need has emerged for articles exhibiting a number of characteristics which are individually hard to achieve but which collectively have made attainment seem almost impossible. For example, the articles have been desired to be hard, tough and wear resistant. The articles have also been desired to be resistant to corrosion and to erosion and to acids and bases normally encountered in commercial and industrial environments. The articles have also been desired to provide these characteristics through ranges of temperatures of several thousands of degrees centigrade. A considerable effort has been made, and substantial sums of money have been expended, to provide articles which meet the above specifications. In spite of such efforts and such expenditures of money, problems have still remained. A material has still not been provided which meets all of the parameters specified above. In U.S. Patent No. 4,397,901 issued on August 9, 1983 for Composite Article and Method of Making Same is disclosed and claim a refractory composite material which fulfills the parameters specified above. For example, the article disclosed and claimed in 17.S. Patent No. 4,397,901 is hard, tough, dimensionally stable, resistant to corrosion and erosion and capable of operating satisfactorily through extended ranges of temperatures in excess of 20000 F. The article disclosed and claimed in U.S. Patent No. 4,397,901 is also relatively light and is able to provide the characteristics discussed above even when produced in relatively thin layers. This invention provides a combination of a matrix and a substrate which meet all of the conditions specified above but have enhanced characteristics relative to the material of U.S. Patent No.4,397,901. For example, the characteristics of the matrix may be controlled to adjust the density of the matrix and the ability of the matrix to withstand oxidation. The invention also relates to a combination of a substrate and a matrix and, in addition, a layer of a material disposed between the substrate and the matrix to prevent the substrate from becoming oxidized. The invention also relates to methods of producing such combinations. In one embodiment of the invention, a porous, permeable substrate has a first coefficient of thermal expansion. The substrate may be formed from a plurality of discrete elements defining interstices. A matrix is disposed on the substrate without any chemical bond to the substrate. The matrix has a second coefficient of thermal expansion different from the first coefficient of thermal expansion and is free to move relative to the substrate with changes in temperature. The matrix may constitute a non stoichiometric compound formed from a metal and a material providing negatively charged ions. The excess from the stoichiometric ratio in the amount of the metal or the material providing the negatively charged ion controls the properties of the matrix. The relative amount of the excess of the metal or the material providing the negative ion from the stoichiometric ratio may be varied at different thicknesses of the matrix to vary the properties of the matrix at the different thicknesses. The matrix may have microscopic cracks in its periphery. An impermeable coating may be disposed on the matrix and may be provided with substantially the second coefficient of thermal expansion. The impermeable coating covers the microscopic cracks and is instrumental in preventing the matrix from oxidizing. An impermeable coating may also be disposed between the substrate and the matrix and may be provided with substantially the second coefficient of thermal expansion. This coating prevents the substrate from oxidizing. The impermeable coatings may be viscous. The different layers or coatings specified above may be formed by continuous techniques or by cyclic or pulsing techniques. In the cyclic or pulsing techniques, a series of individual steps are performed in sequence for controlled periods of time under controlled parameters and are then repeated. This provides for a progressive increase in the thickness of the different coatings or layers. In the drawings Figure 1 is a schematic drawing of apparatus for producing the articles of this invention Figures 2 through 7 are schematic illustrations of different embodiments of articles included within this invention Figure 8 is a table showing the wear test characteristics of different specimens of articles included within the scope of this invention and Figures 9 through 16 are copies of photographs, generally quite magnified, of the construction and characteristics of different specimens of articles included within the scope of this invention. In one embodiment of the invention, a substrate generally indicated at 10 may be provided with porous, permeable properties. The substrate 10 is included in an article generally indicated at 11. The substrate may be formed from discrete elements 12 such as fiber or grains or a mixture of fibers and grains. The discrete elements may have a carbon or ceramic base. By way of illustration, the discrete elements may be formed from a suitable material such as pyrolyzed wool, rayon, polyacrylonitrile and pitch fibers.Carbonizeed rayon felt, chopped fibers of carbonized polyacrylonitrile, carbonized rayon cloth made from interwoven carbon fibers, a tape material made of closely woven, carbonized PAN fibers, a macerated material comprising a multiplicity of randomly oriented pyrolyzed wool fibers and a macerated material having a multiplicity of chopped pitch fibers have specifically been used. The substrate can also advantageously be formed from a slurry comprising granular material such as silicon carbide or graphite. Such granular material can also be mixed with short lengths of high temperature resistant fibers selected from the group consisting of ceramic, pyrolyzed wool, rayon, polyacrylonitrile and pitch. The slurry may alsb include a suitable carbonaceous binder such as petroleum pitch, coal tar pitch, furan resins and phenolic resins. The slurry used to form the substrate may also comprise short lengths of polyacrylonitrile fibers intermixed with silicon carbide in granular form. The different substrates described above may be formed on a continuous basis or may be formed by cyclic or pulsing techniques. When cyclic or pulsing techniques are used, a sequence of steps is provided under controlled conditions for limited periods of time and the sequence is repeated more than once. An example is specified subsequently in Example 11. The substrate described in the previous paragraph may be directly coated with a matrix 14 as shown in Figure 2.However, in order to coat the matrix 14 directly on the substrate 10, the substrate 10 is initially shaped preferably to a configuration corresponding to that desired for the finished article. The substrate 10 is thcn preferably retained in the desired configuration while the matrix 14 is being deposited on the substrate 12. This retention may be provided by a tool or fixture not shown which is constructed to retain the substrate 10 in the desired configuration while still providing for the coating of the matrix at every desired position on the substrate. Coating of the matrix on the substrate in this manner is advantageous in that it is direct and does not require any intermediate preparation of the substrate. However, it generally requires the preparation of special tools and fixtures.Furthermore, it increases the space requirements for the coating operation because of the use of the tools or fixtures. It also tends to slow the rate at which the matrix 14 is coated on the substrate 10. Alternatively, pyrolyzed carbon 16 may be deposited on the substrate 10, as shown in Figure 3, before the deposition of the matrix on the substrate. The pyrolyzed carbon 16 facilitates the promotion of a good load transfer between fibers, particularly when the article is stressed. The pyrolyzed carbon 16 also helps to strengthen and stabilize the substrate 10, particularly when the article is subjected to stress. It also enhances the mechanical interface for increasing the surface fracture energy of the composite structure defining the article 11, thus enhancing the toughness and flow resistance of the refractory composite article 11. To provide the coating 16 of pyrolyzed carbon on the substrate 10, the substrate may be disposed in a furnace of conventional design. The temperature of the substrate may then be raised to a suitable temperature such as approximately 1800 F. and a vacuum in the order of 15mm mercury hg may be maintained within the deposition chamber. Pyrolyzes carbon may then be deposited about each of the discrete elements 12 in the substrate 10 by flowing methane gas through the porous substrate for an extended period of time such as about fifty 50 hours. When the pyrolyzed carbon is deposited on the substrate 10 in the manner discussed in the previous paragraph, it encases the discrete elements defining the substrate. This is illustrated schematically at 16 in Figure 1. The layer of pyrolyzed carbon 16 is porous and pervious. With a density of the substrate in the order of 0.1 gm cc and a fiber volume of about fifteen percent 15 before the deposition of the pyrolyzed carbon 16, the substrate encased with the pyrolyzed carbon may have a density in the order of 0.75 gm cc. The pyrolyzed carbon 16 serves to position the discrete elements 12 in the substrate 10 and to strengthen the substrate for handling purposes. In this way, the matrix 14 can be deposited on the substrate 10 without requiring any tools or fixtures to be used. The pyrolyzed carbon 16 can be deposited on the substrate by other techniques than those discussed above. For example, the substrate 10 can be coated with any suitable and conventional type of resin such as a phenolic designated byMonsanto Chemical Company as Monsanto 1008. As a first step, the phenolic may be dissolved in a solvent such that it is fluid. The solvent may illustratively be methylethylketone.The substrate 10 may then be coated with the phenolic and partially polymerized so that it is dry to the touch. Patterns of the desired shape can then be cut from the substrate 10 or the substrate can be heated to a temperature of at least 160F, compressed and then cut to the desired shape. The patterns in the desired shape may then be placed in a mold and heated to a suitable temperature such as approximately 350F to cure the phenolic. The patterns may then be cured at a temperature above 350 F to stabilize the system. The phenolic is then pyrolyzed at a temperature of approximately 1600 F. to decompose it to carbon, its elemental form. One reason for the pyrolysis is to prevent the substrate from thereafter emitting gases when it is heated. However, the discrete elements 12 are retained in position by the pyrolyzed carbon 16 which is disposed in the interstices between the discrete elements, as shown in Figure 6. The deposition of the pyrolyzed carbon 16 in the interstices between the discrete elements 12 is illustrated schematically at 22 in Figure 2. The combination of the discrete elements 12 and the pyrolyzed carbon 16 in the interstices 22 is porous and pervious. When the binder constituting the phenolic is pyrolyzed as discussed in the previous paragraph, it loses approximately half of its mass and it shrinks and cracks. In spite of this, the pyrolyzed carbon is able to hold the discrete elements 12 in position in the substrate and to impart strength to the substrate. The substrate 10 is then heated to a temperature of approximately 2200ref. for a relatively short period of time to impart a final shrink and pyrolyzation to the binder. Polyurethane or polyethylene can be included in the phenolic binder before the binder is cured and pyrolyzed as discussed in the previous paragrayhs. When the substrate 10 and the binder are then heated to approximately 16000F., the polyurethane or polyethylene vaporizes and facilitates the formation of tunnels in the substrate. As will be disclosed in detail subsequently, the tunnels are effective in providing paths for depositing the matrix 14 on the substrate 10 as by chemical vapor deposition. Instead of using a wet binder to coat the discrete elements 12, a dry binder may be used. Dow Corning Polycarbosilane 6 2330 is illustrative. This is a dry resin which may be mixed with methyl ethyl ketone to provide a fluid mixture with which to work. This material has properties of becoming partially polymerized at room temperatures. The material is mixed with the substrate and is then heated to a temperature of approximately 1600¬µF. to pyrolyze the binder. The material is subsequently heated to a temperature of approximately 2200 F. to provide it with a final pyrolyzation and shrink. Sodium silicate or colloidal alumina can also be used as binders. The substrate 10 may be dipped into sodium silicate in liquid form and may then be heated. The sodium silicate flows along the lengths of the discrete elements 10 and tends to congregate or agglomerate at the interstices between the discrete elements. The formation of layers of material at the interstices between the fibers of the substrate 10 is shown inFigures 6 and 7. As will be appreciated, the characteristics of the substrate can be considerably varied without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, when fibers are used in a woven form, the relative numbers of threads in warp and woof can be varied in great proportions and the spacings between the threads can also be varied considerably. A suitable material such as silicon carbide can be applied to the substrate 10 to form an intermediate layer 24 between the substrate 10 and the matrix 14. This intermediate layer 24 may be deposited on the substrate 10 before the deposition of the matrix 14, as shown in Figure 4. The intermediate layer 24 may also be deposited on the pyrolyzed layer 16 as shown in Figure 5. This intermediate layer 14 may have a density in the order of 1 gram cubic centimeter. To produce this intermediate layer 24, the temperature of the substrate may be raised to about 1600 F. 2200 F. and a vacuum in the order of about 0.1 to 0.6 atmosphere may be maintained within the furnace. A methylchlorosilane gas may then be flowed interstitially through the substrate for a period of about one 1 to 20 hours.By this method, a substantially uniform layer 24 of pyrolytic silicon carbide may be deposited about each of the fibers within the substrate to form the intermediate substrate with the density in the order of about 0.4 to 2.35 gram cubic centimeter. Other suitable materials for the layer 24 may be metal oxides, metal nitrides, metal silicides, metal borides and metal carbides. The intermediate layer 24 may be viscous. As previously described, the substrate 10 is porous and pervious. This means that air can penetrate into the substrate and oxidize the carbon in the substrate. This can produce a deterioration in the properties of the substrate over a period of time. The matrix 14 may not be helpful in inhibiting the oxidation of the substrate since the matrix is generally porous and permeable. The intermediate layer 24 is accordingly helpful in inhibiting the oxidation of the substrate 10. The impermeable coating 24 may be deposited on the substrate 10 befdre the matrix 14 is deposited on the substrate.When the pyrolyzed carbon 16 encases the discrete elements 12, the impermeable coating 24 encases the pyrolyzed carbon as schematically shown in Figure 2. The impermeable coating 24 is disposed in the interstices between the discrete elements 12, as shown schematically in Figures 6 and 7, when the pyrolyzed carbon is disposed in the interstices. The coating 24 may be relatively thin since its primary function is to serve as a barrier for preventing air from reaching the substrate to oxidize the substrate. However, it also renders the substrate 10 impervious to corrosion and erosion caused by high temperatures and exposure to hostile fluids. The impermeable coating 24 may be made from a suitable material such as silicon nitride. When the coating 24 of silicon nitride is deposited on the substrate 10, it does not have any chemical bond with the substrate. Furthermore, any mechanical bond between the coating 24 of silicon nitride and the substrate 10 is relatively weak.Since a strong bond is absent between the substrate 10 and the coating 24, increased surface fracture energy toughness is produced between the substrate and the cbating. Flow sensitivity in the article is also reduced. The coating 24 of silicon nitride also has a significantly different coeflicient of thermal expansion than the substrate 10. As a result, the layer 24 of silicon nitride is free to move relative to the substrate 10 with changes in temperature. This is particularly important because of the considerable range of temperatures in the thousands of degreesFahrenheit in which the articles formed from the refractory composite materials of this invention are expected to work. The coating 24 of silicon nitride may be deposited on the substrate 10 as by techniques of molten liquid as disclosed in Patent No. 4,397,901. For example, the substrate 10 may be heated to a temperature of about 3200 F. in a controlled environment which is maintained at slightly greater than atmospheric pressure and a slurry of elemental silicon may be deposited on the discrete elements 12 coated with the pyrolytic carbon 16. The silicon coated substrate 10 may then be heated to a temperature of about 32000 F. in the controlled environment and suitable gases such as silicon chloride and nitrogen may be passed through, and about, the article to deposit a coating of silicon nitride on the substrate so as to form the layer 24. Alternatively, the coating 24 of silicon nitride may be directly deposited on the substrate 10, as shown in Figure 4, without first having to deposit molten silicon on the substrate as by the methods of the previous paragraph. This direct deposition may be accomplished as by a chemical vapor deposition. This may be accomplished by heating the substrate 10 in a controlled environmcnt to a suitable temperature such as about 18000F. and then passing gases containing silicon and nitrogen through and about the substrate. For example, the gases may be silicon chloride and nitrogen. As previously described, the matrix 14 may be applied directly to the substrate 14. However, when the coating 24 is included, the matrix 14 may be applied on the coating. The matrix 14 has substantially the same coefficient of thermal expansion as the coating 24. This causes the matrix 14 to expand with the doating 24 when it is disposed on the coating.The matrix 14 encases the coating 24 when the coating encases the substrate 10. The matrix 14 is disposed in the interstices of the discrete elements 12 when the coating 24 is disposed in such interstices. When the matrix 14 is disposed on the substrate 10 without the intermediate disposition of the coating 24, the matrix 14 encases the pyrolyzed carbon 16 when the pryolyzed carbon encases the discrete elements 12. The matrix 14 is disposed in the interstices beween the discrete elements 12 when the pyrolyzed carbon 16 is disposed in such interstices. The matrix 14 does not have any chemical bond with the substrate 10. Furthermore, any mechanical bond between the matrix 14 and the substrate 10 is relatively weak when the matrix is disposed directly on the substrate. The matrix 14 may be formed from a suitable material consisting of a metal and a material providing negatively charged ions. Preferably the matrix 14 may be formed from a material selected from a group consisting of silicon nitride, silicon carbide and silicon oxide. The matrix 14 may be preferably formed from silicon carbide. Silicon carbide is advantageous because it is hard and tough and provides good protection to the substrate. To apply the matrix 14 on the substrate 10, the substrate may be disposed in a furnace and heated to a temperature in the range of about 1350 F. to 2500 F. Preferably the substrate 10 is heated to a temperature of about 18000F. in a mild vacuum. This temperature is intermediate a preferred temperature range of about 1600 F. to 2000 F. A suitable gas containing silicon and carbon may then be passed through and over the substrate 10 in the furnace. For example, suitable gases such as methyltrichlorosilane, dimethyldichlorosilane and trimethylchlorosilane may be used. The gas may be allowed to fill the furnaces to a pressure between about 0.01 and 0.6 atmospheres. Following the introduction into the furnace of the gases containing the silicon and the carbon, the gases are withdrawn from the furnace by producing a mild vacuum. New gases containing silicon and carbon are then introduced into the furnace. This process is repeated through a number of cycles until the matrix has been formed with the desired thickness.The temperature of the substrate 10 may be intermittently raised to about 2700 F to produce a dimensional stability between the silicon carbide in the matrix 74 and the pyrolyzed carbon 16 on the substrate 10. The following chemical reaction may be produced when the gases contain methyltrichlorosilane SiCH3C13 Heat Si C 3HCl 1 This chemical reaction is endothermic because it requires the addition of heat. The next reaction is exothermic EMI15.1 Another chemical reaction, also exothermic, after reaction 1 may be EMI15.2 A further chemical reaction, also exothermic, after reaction 1 may be EMI15.3 The particular chemical constituents produced are dependent upon certain parameters including temperature, pressure, gases used, flow rate of the gases and mass rate of the gases. The mass rate is in turn dependent upon such factors as flow rate and the particular gases used. The periodic introduction of gases to the furnace and subsequent exhaustion of these gases from the furnace provide certain important advantages. As will be seen, the composition of the gases introduced to the furnace changes with time because of the chemical reactions in the gases and because of the exhaustion of the gases as the gases are chemically reacted to produce the matrix 14. This causes the properties of the matrix 14 to vary with time. By exhausting these gases from the furnace after a relatively short period of time and subsequently introducing a new supply of such gases, relatively constant characteristics can be provided for the matrix 14 along the full thickness of the matrix.Alternatively, the characteristics of the matrix 14 can be precisely controlled along the full thickness of the matrix to provide the matrix with the optimal properties desired for the matrix at the progressive thicknesses of the matrix. Trimethylchlorosilane is more unstable than dimethyldichlorosilane, which is in turn more unstable than methyltrichlorosilane. Since trimethychlorosilane is the most unstable of the three 3 chlorosilane compounds, it degenerates into its components more easily than the other compounds.Since the degeneration of trimethychlorosilane occurs more easily than the degeneration of the other gases and since the gases produced from the degeneration of the trimethylchlorosilane are lighter than the trimethylchlorosilane, the gases produced from the degeneration of the trimethylchlorosilane are able to travel further in an increment of time than the gases produced from the degeneration of dimethyldichlorosilane or from the degeneration of methyltrichlorosilane This provides for a deposit of the gas components on the peripheral edges of the article more easily when trimethylchlorosilane is used than when other compounds are used. The characteristics of the matrix can be varied by varying the characteristics of the chemical vapor deposition.For example, the composition of the gases, the temperature and pressure of the gases and the flow rate and mass rate of the gases can be varied to affect the characteristics of the matrix 14. The size of the grains in the matrix 14, the orientation of the grains in the matrix and the relative amounts of free carbon and free silicon in the deposition can be controlled in this manner. The microscopic density of the silicon carbide in the matrix 14 can also be varied in this manner. As will be appreciated, the silicon carbide in the matrix 14 can be provided with a stoichiometric ratio or with a non stoichromatric ratio. When the silicon carbide is stoichiometric, the relative amounts of silicon and carbon can be predicted on the basis of their relative atomic weights.When there is an excess of silicon or carbon in the matrix above the stoichiometric ratio of these elements, the matrix can be considered to be non stoichiometric. An excess of carbon in the matrix 14 produces an increase in the hardness of the matrix but also increases the tendency of the matrix to be oxidized by oxygen from the air. An excess of silicon in the matrix 14 decreases the hardness of the matrix but increases the ability of the matrix to withstand oxygen from the air. As will be appreciated, the particular material chosen to provide the excess above the stoichiometric ratio at any thickness of the matrix, and the relative amount of such excess at such thickness, can be chosen to tailor the characteristics of the matrix at the different thicknesses. The grain structure of the matrix 14 can be varied by varying the parameters discussed above. For example, the size of the grain can be varied between approximately fifty angstrom 50A and approximately five microns 5u , which is in excess of fifty thousand Angstroms 50,000A . Generally, the strength of the matrix 14 is enhanced as the grain size is decreased.Actually, the grain size can be tailored to different values at different thicknesses of the matrix. Actually, there is probably a reduction in density from a stoichiometric relationship of a material such as silicon carbide in the matrix to a non stoichiometric relationship of the material such as silicon carbide in the matrix. However, since the atomic weight of silicon is greater than that of carbon, there is less of a reduction in density for a particular excess of silicon in the matrix than for the same excess of carbon in the matrix. Thus, as will be seen, the properties of the matrix 14 can be varied at progressive thicknesses of the matrix. For example, it may be initially desirable to provide an excess of silicon in the matrix 14 so as to inhibit the oxidation of the matrix, at least in the areas adjacent the substrate 10. It may be subsequently desirable to provide the matrix 14 with an excess of carbon. This provides the external surface of the matrix 14 with hard and dense characteristics. Other gases can be included in the chemical vapor deposition in addition to those specified above. For example, gases of argon and helium can be included in the gases introduced to the furnace. Both argon and helium are neutral.They impart energy to the gases in the furnace and they contro the rate at which the matrix 14 is deposited on the substrate.They also control the characteristics of the deposition. The relative amount of hydrogen in the gases can also be varied. The relative amount of hydrogen affects the chemical and heat balance of the gases introduced to the furnace. As a result, the relative amount of hydrogen in the gases affects the characteristics of the deposition. For example, when the furnace is maintained at a relatively low temperature and a considerable amount of hydrogen is introduced into the furnace, an excess of silicon above the stoichiometric ratio tends to be deposited. Furthermore, even slight changes in temperature can affect the hardness of the deposition. By way of illustration, a change of about 10 F. in the furnace can produce a change of as many as 1000 points in Vickers hardness out of a range of approximately 1300 4400 in Vickers hardness.Thus, the mixture of a small amount of hydrogen with the gases producing the matrix 14 may have a significant effect on the hardness of the matrix which is produced. Boron can also be included in the gases introduced into the furnace to obtain the chemical vapordeposition. The inclusion of boron in the mixture enhances the tendency of the matrix 14 produced from the deposition of the gases to be forgiving, This enhances the toughness of the matrix 14 and the ability of the matrix to withstand strain. The boron in the mixture acts as a getter. It accumulates the material of the matrix 14, such as silicon carbide, from active sites and causes the silicon carbide from such active sites to be sintered together. Without the inclusion of the boron, the silicon carbide tends to be deposited at the active sites. Nominally about two percent 2 by weight of the boron may be included in the mixture. Preferably the range of boron is about one percent 1 to three 3 by weight.Preferably less than five percent 5 of boron by weight is included in the mixture. Other gases may be used in producing a chemical vapor deposition of the matrix 14 on the substrate 10. For example, a mixture of silicon tetrachloride and methane may be used. The mixture of silicon tetrachloride and methane tends to produce a deposition of silicon carbide to form the matrix. Such a mixture may require a greater amount of energy to produce the matrix than some of the gases specified above. As will be appreciated, the substrate 10 disposed in the furnace can be pre heated to impart energy to the gases in the furnace for enhancing the production of a chemical reaction of the gases. The resultant deposition of the material such as silicon carbide on the substrate 10 to form the matrix 14 has first characteristics. Alternatively, the substrate does not have to be pre heated before being introduced into the furnace.In either case, the gases receive sufficient kinetic energy to produce chemical reactions when they collide. Particles of silicon carbide are produced as a soot in free space as a result of such collisions and as a result of the chemical reactions occurring during the collisions. The characteristics of the silicon carbide produced without pre heating the substrate 10 are different from the characteristics of the silicon carbide produced by pre heating the substrate. This results in part from differences in microscopic structure of the grains of silicon carbide deposited on the substrate. As will be appreciated, in addition to forming the matrix 14 by the two separate techniques discussed above, the matrix 14 can be formed by a combination of such techniques to provide the matrix with a blend of characteristics. When the matrix 14 is formed from a suitable material such as silicon carbide in the manner described above, it tends to receive microscopic cracks in its periphery. These cracks are advantageous because they tend to impart resilience and flexibility to the matrix, particularly when the matrix is subjected to stresses. The cracks are disadvantageous because they increase the amount of the surface exposed to oxygen. As a result, there tends to be an increase in the rate at which the matrix 14 is oxidized. An impermeable coating 36 may be disposed on the matrix 14 to cover the matrix and inhibit the oxidation of the matrix. This is particularly important when the matrix 14 has the microscopic cracks as discussed above. The coating 36 may be formed from a suitable material such as silicon oxide.Silicon oxide is advantageous because it is hard and impermeable and because it is impervious to oxygen. For example, since the silicon oxide already includes oxygen, it cannot be oxidized by the oxygen in the air. The silicon oxide has substantially the same coefficient of thermal expansion as the silicon carbide in the matrix 14. Because of this, it has properties of moving with the matrix 14 with changes in temperature. The coating of silicon oxide may be deposited on the matrix under substantially the same conditions of various parameters such as temperature pressure and flow rate as those used to deposit the matrix 14 of silicon carbide on the substrate. The deposition of the silicon oxide on the matrix 14 may also be accomplished by liquid spray or immersion such as discussed above. Other materials such as silicon nitride may be provided as the layer 36.Furthermore, other materials such as metal oxides, metal nitrides, metal silicides, metal borides and metal carbides may also be used as the layer 24. The layer may be viscous. Figure 1 illustrates a schematic diagram of a furnace, generally indicated at 40, which may be used to produce the composite materials described above. The furnace 40 includes an enclosure 42 having an inlet 44 and an outlet 46. Gases, such as those used to produce a chemical vapor deposition of the matrix 14 on the substrate 10, are introduced into the furnace 40 through the inlet 44. The gases flow downwardly along the walls defining the enclosures as indicated by arrows 48. The gases then flow upwardly along a partition 50, as indicated by arrows 52. Since the path defined by the arrows 48 and 52 within the furnace 40 is relatively long, the gases have a considerable opportunity to become heated to the temperature of the furnace 40. The gases then flow downwardly within the space defined by the partition 50 and flow from the furnace 40 through the outlet 46. During the flow of the gases within the partition 48, the gases have an opportunity to become deposited on the article1 such as the substrate 10, in which a deposition is to be provided. EXAMPLESExample No. 1 Starting Substrate Carbonized Rayon Felt 1 4 x 12 x 4 Density .lgm cc Fiber Volume about 7 The substrate was hcated to approximately 1150 1250C to thermally stabilize the substrate. The temperature of the substrate was then reduced to a value between approximately 700 10009C. Then approximately 200 cc. hr of H2SiC12 Dichlorosilane and 5 LPM liter min of NH3 Ammonia were flowed through the substrate for approximately 15 minutes to deposit approximately 1000A 5000A angstrom of Si3N4 Silicon Nitride coating on and about the surfaces of all of the fibers throughout the felt substrate Slides . This constitutes the intermediate layer 24.The combination of the substrate 10 and the intermediate layer 24 was removed and inspected. The combination was then replaced in the furnace and heated to a temperature between about 900 C and 12000C and preferably about 10400c and infiltrated with methyltrichlorosilane using applicant s standard conditions for a total of 25 hours to form the matrix 14 and bring the density of the composite to about 1.50 gm cc. The standard conditions are set forth in row 5 of the table constituting Figure 8.Then the composite material was vacuum impregnated with a 12 B203 Boron oxide doped TEOS Tetraethylorthosilicate . The composite was then hydrolized in a humidity chamber to form alcohol and a borosilicate residue on the surface of the exposed surfaces in the SiC silicon arbie matrix 14 and the fiber substrate 10 throughout the system. A borosilicate residue is advantageous because boron depresses the temperature at which glass softens. This causes the softening temperature of the glass to be reduced to a sufficiently low value so that the layers in the composite cannot be oxidized because the energy in the layers is insufficient to accomplish this. The composite was then placed in a vacuum chamber and heated to a temperature of about 1200 C to densify and flow the glaze. This provided a 1 5 micron coating on all exposed surfaces.Example No. 2 Rayon, pitch, PAN acrylic based carbon fibers or silicon carbide, alumina mullite, quartz, zirconia silica or other ceramic fiber have been used as the substrate. The volume fraction V O of the substrate was between about 2.5 60 . The volume fraction of the substrate was normally about 35 . The volume fraction indicates the relative volume of the substrate material in the total volume of the substrate 10. A binder was used to hold the fibers in position during the matrix infiltration. The binder can be any material that, when heated to a temperature of about 12000C, provides a pyrolized residue to hold the fibers in their final shape, orientation and volume fraction. Phenolic resin has been most commonly used but many others are available. A primary key lies in providing a substrate with open pores and a minimum of pores with bottlenecks so that reactive gases for producing the subsequent layers are free to permeate the composite structure. The intermediate layer 24 and the matrix 14 for the second example were produced as in the first example.Example No. 3 Alternate binders for Example No. 2 have been phenolic with approximately 5 20 of polyurethane, styrene or other suitable filler that will enhance the open nature of the pore structure. Alternate binders may also include colloidal silica and colloidal alumina. In addition, the use of fugitive fillers with reduced melting temperatures has provided open gas paths to reduce the time of processing the phenolic. A fugitive filler vaporizes at elevated temperatures and produces pores to enhance the open nature of the substrate. An example of a fugitive filler is nylon which melts or vaporizes at relatively low temperatures. When the nylon melts or vaporizes, it runs and produces tunnel like pores in the substrate. Example No. 4 An alternate binder to those specified in Example 2 has also been a polycarbosilane resin which has been processed similarly to the phenolic. It tends to heat shrink about the fibers of the substrate during pyrolysis, thus enhancing the open pore structure of the substrate and reducing bottleneck porosity of the substrate. Pyrolysis of the substrate in a vacuum or in an inert atmosphere has resulted in a silicon, carbon or nitrogen type of residue. However, pyrolysis of the substrate under atmospheric conditions has resulted in a low density Si02 residue which has a low strength but which is quite suitable as a binder for ceramic fibers that would otherwise react with the carbon of an organic binder. As will be appreciated, since the residue is silicon dioxide, it does not react with the binder.Example No. 5 Silicon carbide SiC or Carbon infiltrated SiC or graphite grain or fiber have been used as the substrate. Graphite or other high temperature materials with an appropriate coefficient of thermal expansion have also been used as the substrate. The substrate was placed in a vacuum chamber and heated to a temperature between approximately 900 C and 1900 C. The pressure in the vacuum chamber was about 5irm Torr to 250mm Torr . A source gas constituting dimethyldichlorosilane was then passed through the chamber to provide the chemical vapor deposition of the matrix 14.The source gas was mixed with a carrier constituting hydrogen and with a diluant constituting argon.By varying the temperature, pressure and gas flow as shown in Figure 1, the Vickers Hardness Number VHn of the matrix 14 has been controlled.This hardness is a function of the free silicon or free carbon in the system. The stoichiometricSiC provided a Vickers hardness VHn of about 2600 2800. VHn numbers above this range have increased amounts of free carbon at the grain boundaries. VHn numbers below this range have increased amounts of free silicon at the grain boundaries. This may be seen in Figure 9. As will be seen in rows 1 and 2 of the table constituting Figure 8, the Vickers hardness of the matrix 14 is reduced when the temperature and pressure of the flowing gases are reduced while the rate of the gases, such as dimethyldichlorosilane and argon, is maintained constant. As will be seen in rows 2 and 3 of the table constituting Figure 8, the Vickers hardness of the substrate is increased when the temperature and pressure of the gases are maintained substantially constant and the rate of flow of the dimethyldichlorosilane is maintained substantially constant but the rate of flow of the argon is increased.Example No. 6 The same substrate as in Example 5 was used. The parameters for producing the matrix 14 were as follows Pressure 5mm 250mm Temperature 900 1200 C Source Gas Trimethylchlorosilane TMCS Boron Trichloride BC73 Carrier Hydrogen Diluant Argon To deposit the matrix 14, coating runs were made with trimethylchlorosilane TMCS . This resulted in higher deposition rates than obtained with equivalent coatings deposited from dimethylchlorosilane DMS or methyltrichlorosilane FITS The microstructure, however, tended to become columnar. A columnar structure may not be desirable because it defines lines representing differences in properties. As a result, cracks tend to be produced along these lines. A 10 addition of boron chloride BC13 resulted in microstructure refinement by combining the excess carbon with boron to form B4C Boron Carbide . This refinement in microstructure in turn resulted in increased coating strength, a glassy structure and controllable hardnesses of approximately 3000 4000VHn. The refinement in microstructure tended to enhance the homogeneity of the matrix 14 by producing particles of reduced size. This prevented the matrix 14 from being columnar. The inclusion of boron chloride to produce a glassy structure was desirable because the boron chloride enhanced the production of the fine grain structure and caused the matrix to be oxidation resistant.Example No. 7 Typical 1 4 x 1 2 x 4 carbon fiber substrates were prepared by using both a phenolic resin char binder and external fixturing to hold the fibers in position prior to SiC infiltration to form the matrix 14. Figures 10a and 1Ob shows the interstices of a fiber bundle to be filled with a resin char and overcoated with a sheath of silicon carbide deposited by chemical vapor deposition CVD . Those fibers free of char in the areas of the char bonded fiber bundle are uniformly sheathed with CVD SiC. Figure 10 Figures 11 and 12 shows the uniform concentric sheathing of the fibers, their bonding together by the CVD sheath, the lack of bond strength fiber pull out between the fiber substrate and the CVD matrix 14 and the open nature of the substrate interstices even after infiltration with the CVD matrix Figures 11 and 12 .Example No. 8 Figures 13 and 14 show the dramatic difference in the deposition thickness of the SiC matrix 14 vs fiber location in the substrate 10. Typical CVD infiltration efforts resulted in increased thicknesses of the matrix 14 deposited at, or close to, the surface of the substrate 10. Examined in cross section, the thickness of the matrix coating in such typical CVD infiltration decreases dramatically as one visually approaches the center of the composite material. This increased thickness in the matrix coating at the periphery of the composite mateial tends to block the material of the matrix 14 from being deposited into the core of the substrate 10. As a result, the external surface of the matrix 14 often has to be shaved in order for the deposition of the matrix to be continued into the core of the substrate 10. Figures 13 and 14, however, show an ability to control the phenomena discussed in the previous paragraph and, in fact, reverse it. Figures 13 and 14 are at the same magnification and show a typical two fiber orientation. The relative orientations of the photographs of Figures 13 and 14 in the composite refractory material may be seen from the photograph of Figure 15, which shows the composite material with a reduced magnification relative to the photographs of Figures 13 and 14. Figure 15 also shows the relative positioning in Figure 15 of the photographs constituting Figures 13 and 14.Taken within 0.010 of the specimen surface, the photograph of Figure 13 has approximately one third 1 3 of the matrix thickness shown on the fibers in Figure 14, which is a photograph taken approximately 0.125 from the specimen surface. In other words, the deposition internally in the composite material is thicker than at the surface of the composite material. This deposition was obtained by using methyltrichlorosilane MTS . A complete reversal of this profile can be made by using DMS under standard infiltration conditions.In view of the above, the thickness of the matrix at different positions in the composite material can be controlled by varying the properties of the chemical vapor deposition at different times. For example, the thickness of the matrix at different positions in the composite material can be controlled by introducing different chemical vapors such as trimethylchlorosilane, dimethychlorosilane and methyltrichlorosilane into the substrate 10 at different times.The ability to control infiltration thickness can also be used to grade a particular substrate from a CVD filtration bon.led to a CVD SiC coated part. Figure 16 shows a cross section of an infiltrated fibrous part integrally locked bonded to a homogeneous CVD SiC overcoating.Example No. 9 Diluants such as argon and helium have been successfully used to control such as by flattening deposition profiles, suppress soot formation and control the microstructure of the matrix 14 and other layers such as the intermediate layer 24. Because of its specific heat, argon has been used to cool or maintain the reactive temperatures of the gases within controlled limits when the set up geometry and mass gas flow conditions has indicated the desirability of this. Since helium has a relatively high specific heat, helium has been used to increase the reactive temperatures of the gas, thus providing an ability to minimize set up flow distances and still achieve maximum gas temperatures in the reactive zone. Example No. 10 Silicon carbide SiC and graphite grains or particles and graphite and or ceramic fibers have been combined to form the substrate 10. Such combinations have been successful. For example, typical flexural strengths of approximately 8 10,000 psi for a phenolic char bonded silicon carbide grain substrate, infiltrated to 2.10 grams cc to form the matrix 14, have b produced.This is approximately equal to the strength of commercially available silicon nitride bonded to SiC grain at densities of greater than 2.8Ogm cc Example No. 11 Substitution of silicon carbide grain particles and graphite particles A combination of SiC and graphite particles1 and particles with continuous and discontinuous graphite and or ceramic fibers, has been successful in providing a satisfactory substrate. This substrate replaces substrates made entirely from fibers such as the substrates specified above in Examples 1 and 2. A typical flexural strength of a phenolic char bonded SiC grain substrate, infiltrated to 2.10 gm cc, is approximately 8 10,000 psi. This is approxi mately equal to the strength, at densities greater than 2.80 gm cc, of commercially available SiC grain bonded with silicon nitride.Example No. 12 Density 0.1 gm cc Fiber Volume The steps specified below have been used to produce a starting substrate with the characteristics specified above in this Example W11. As a first step, the carbonized rayon felt was heated to 1150 1200 C to stabilize the felt thermally. The temperature of the felt was then reduced to approximately 900 11000C. Atmosphere Vacuum 5 25 mm Hg Mercury .The vacuum valve was then closed approximately 600 cc hr of Si CH3 C13 Methyltrichlorosilane , 9 LPE H2 hydrogen and 20 SPH ar Argon was allowed to flow until the chamber pressure increased to approximately 125 225 mm Hg Mercury . The vacuum valve was then opened and the pressure was reduced to approximately 5 25 mm Hg. On reaching the pressure of approximately 5 25 mm Hg, the cycle specified above was repeated for a sufficient number of cycles to achieve the desired final density Because the requirements for the construction of the starting substrate and for the density of the final component vary widely from application to application, the actual process time and chamber set up may also be modified as a function of the component design and the operational need.
