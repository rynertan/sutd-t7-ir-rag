# Fusible link short detector with array of reference fuses.

## Abstract
Circuitry is provided for testing fusible link arrays for short circuits around the fusible links. The resistance of each corresponding link in each of the four quandrants in the array is compared with the resistance of an array of reference fusible links to detect the presence or absence of a short circuit.
