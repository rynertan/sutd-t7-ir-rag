# Semiconductor light position detector for rangefinder.

## Abstract
A semiconductor light position detector for a rangefinder which projects a light beam onto an object and receives a reflected light beam from the object to measure a distance to the object. A portion of the light receiving surface 6 of the detector on which the reflected beam will not form a light spot is partially covered with a member 2 that blocks unwanted light. Thus, the malfunctions caused by the flare component of the light from the light projector and the malfunctions due to increases in the shot noise under a high illuminance are reduced greatly.
