# A COMPOSITE MATERIAL

## Abstract
A composite material consists of two ultraviolet stable film layers enclosing an air bubble film layer, the layers being sealed together at their peripheral edges and being especially useful for energy conservation purposes. The composite material can, for example, be adhered or other wise secured to a glass layer to provide a cheap, light weight double glazed window or door.
