# Margarine product and process.

## Abstract
Emulsified spreads, such as margarines, are made from structural fats having double peaked differential scanning calorimetry curves, one representing triglycer ides crystallizing at temperatures of from about 77 F 25 C to about 50 F 10 C and a second representing triglycerides crystallizing at about 41 F 5 C to about 14 F 10 C . The process for forming such spreads involves 1 cooling an emulsion of the structural fat, a sort oil and an aqueous phase to a temperature at or below the nucleation of triglyc erides crystallizing at the higher temperature range 2 working the emulsion 3 cooling the worked emulsion to the nucleation point of the triglycerides crystallizing at the lower temperature range and 4 working the emulsion a second time.
