# Banknote dispensing machine with delivery device for the receipt for the banknotes dispensed.

## Abstract
The machine comprises a tined wheel 9 for bundling the banknotes 8, a conveyor 14, 19, 20 for presenting them to the customer through a slot 24, and a printer 26 for printing the receipt. This is cut off by a blade 63 and is guided by a system of belts 35, 43, 51 in such manner as to be fed into the wheel 9. The receipt is thus bundled together with the banknotes and is presented to the customer with them through the slot 24, avoiding the risk of the customer forgetting to collect his receipt before a vandal proof shutter closes. The printer 26 can print a journal strip in addition to the receipt.
