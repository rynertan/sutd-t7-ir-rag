# METHOD AND MATERIALS USEFUL FOR THE ANALYSIS AND DETECTION OF GENETIC MATERIAL

## Abstract
In techniques for the analysis of genetic material, such as DNA and or RNA, wherein the genetic material is dena tured, fixed to a substrate and hybridized with a probe, superior results are obtainable when there is employed as the probe a chemically labeled probe which, preferably after hybridization, has added or attached thereto, such as to the chemical label or moiety of the probe, an enzyme component effective upon contact with a chromogen to pro duce an insoluble color precipitate or product. Techniques for the analysis of genetic material which are improved in sensitivity, definition, accuracy and or speed, by employing a chemically labeled probe, include such well known tech niques as Southern blot analysis, Northern blot analy sis, Western blot analysis, colony hybridization, plaque lifts, cytoplasmic dot hybridization, in situ hybridization to cells and or tissues and other such techniques.
