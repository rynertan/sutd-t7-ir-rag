# Method for adhering a coating material to a random fiber composite sheet.

## Abstract
A method for adhering a coating material to at least one surface of a densified random fiber composite sheet is provided. The method comprises applying heat to a surface of the composite sheet to form an activated surface whereby the fiber component of the sheet is projected outwardly from a plane defined by that surface, and contacting the activated surface with the coating material. The coating material is generally of a viscous or liquid nature such that it can physically interact with the projecting fibers to adhere thereto. A method for adhering asphalt to a metal substrate employing a densified random fiber composite sheet is also provided wherein the metal is coated with an adhesive and then adhered to an activated surface of a composite sheet. Asphalt is then coated onto the exposed surface of the composite sheet which has been activated or is activated by coating with hot asphalt.
