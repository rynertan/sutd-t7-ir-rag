# DRIVER CIRCUIT FOR A FUEL INJECTOR

## Abstract
Driver circuit, having boost and hold modes of opera tion, for a fuel injector having a solenoid 21 including a high impedance coil 22 and a low impedance coil 24 wherein the coils 22, 24 are so situated that their respec tive magnetic fields are additive and wherein said driver circuit is responsive to input metering pulse width signals and includes adaptive means 40 for modifying the dura tion of each pulse width signal to generate a boost pulse signal to excite the low impedance coil 22 in correspond ence with the variations in the supply voltage source 30 driver means 44, 46 for permitting the current flowing through the low impedance coil 22 to flow into the high impedance coil 24 means 70 for regulating the level of current flowing through the high impedance coil 24 at a determinable value and means for reducing the current droop occuring upon the transition from the boost mode of operation to the hold mode of operation.
