## Description
POLYMER COMPOSITION The invention relates to a polymer composition based on a polycarbonate, a graft copolymer and a polyurethane. Such a polymer composition is known from the Netherlands patent application 7300479 laid open to public inspection. This application relates to a polymer composition consisting of a predominating quantity more than 90 of polycarbonate, a small quantity less than 2 X of graft copolymer and a modifier, such as polyethylene or a polyurethane elastomer. From various publications it is known that mixtures of polycarbonate PC with a graft copolymer of styrene and acrylonitrile on a rubber ABS have favourable properties. Examples of such publications are the German patent specifications 1,170,141 and 1,810,993, theNetherlands patent applications 7316731 and 7316733 laid open to public inspection, or the European patent applications 146, 5.202 and 51.336 laid open to public inspection. The ABS PC compositions have favourable properties as to their processability, heat resistance and impact resistance at room temperature. These properties make these compositions particularly suitable for all sorts of uses in motor cars, such as dashboards, bumpers, grills and other car parts. It has been found, however, that the resistance of these polymer compositions to organic solvents, such a8 petrol, may not be satisfactory. This resistance to petrol is not only of great importance or on various, particularly exterior, car parts, but also for, for instance, helmets. One of the objects of the present invention is to provide a polymer composition combining the said favourable properties of ABS PC compositions with this good petrol resistance. According to the invention such a polymer composition compri ses A. 5 90 wt of one or more graft copolymers obtained by polymerizing 10 90 parts by weight of a monomer mixture consisting of 20 40 Z wt acryl compound, 60 80 wt vinylaromatic compound, and 0 20 Z wt of one or more other unsaturated compounds, in the pre sence of 10 90 parts by weight rubber.B. 0 70 wt of one or more copolymers obtained by polymerizing 60 80 parts by weight vinylaromatic compounds, 20 40 parts by weight acryl compounds, 0 20 parts by weight of one or more other unsaturated compounds,C. 5 90 Z wt of one or more polycarbonates, andD. 0.5 25 Z wit of one ore more polyurethanes. Surprisingly it has been found that, when combining the ABS PC composition with one or more polyurethanes, a product is obtained showing, in addition to the good petrol resistance, very good processing characteristics, too. The flow behaviour in particular is improved upon considerably. The petrol resistance of polymer compositions is determined by so bending on a die, tensile test bars moulded from the compositions to be tested that an elongation of E 0.7 X occurs. These pre bent tensile test bars are subsequently submerged under this load in a testing medium of the following composition 42.5 Z 2,2,4 trimethylpentane, 42.5 Z toluene and 15 Z methanol. After 5 minutes the bars are taken from the testing medium, upon which the testing medium evaporates. After 24 hours the test bars are subjected to a tensile test according to DIN 53455.Subsequently, the elongations at break of these test bars are compared with elongations at break of test bars not submerged in the testing medium Plastverarbeiter 33, 1982, 9, 1071 . From, for instance, the Netherlands patent application 8003798 it is known that the processing characteristics are related to the spiral flow length. Moreover, the composition according to the invention has an improved resistance to Uv radiation, as well as to wear. The gloss of the composition is lower than that of the ABS PC composition, which is favourable particularly for uses in the automotive industry. Effective acryl compounds for use in the present invention are acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile alkylacrylate, alkylmethacrylate or mixtures thereof. Preference is given to acrylonitrile in graft copolymer A and or copolymer B. Effective vinylacromatic compounds are styrene and substituted styrene compounds, such as a methylstyrene, p vinyltoluene, halogenated styrene or mixtures thereof. Preference is given to the use of styrene or a methylstyrene. In certain cases preference may have to be given to using styrene as well as x methylstyrene, in which cases it may be convenient particularly to use styrene in the graft copolymer and a methylstyrene in the copolymer, or the reverse. The rubber content of the graft copolymer is preferably between 15 and 50 Z wt in respect of the graft copolymer. In connection with achieving an optimum ratio between impact resistance and processing characteristics flow it may be advantageous to use two or more graft copolymers having a different rubber content.For an optimum effect it is desirable for the various graft copolymers to show a difference in rubber content of at least 5 Z wit in respect of the graft copolymer. Although in principle all rubbers having a glass transition temperature lower than 30 OC can be used, preference is given to rubbers having a glass transition temperature lower than 55 C, because the impact resistance of the graft copolymer component tends to decrease in the neighbourhood of the glass transition temperature. More particularly a butadiene rubber is used, such as polybutadiene, butadiene styrene, butadiene acrylonitrile or butadieneacrylate rubber. In connection with, for instance, the resistance to UV radiation, it may be desirable, however, to deviate from said considerations and to chose another rubber, such as an EPDM rubber, as a grafting basis. This may then be at the expanse, however, of the impact resistance at very low temperature. In principle all thermoplastic polycarbonates are suitable for the compositions of the invention. Polycarbonates are known per se and can be obtained by conversion of dihydroxy or polyhydroxy compounds with phosgene or diesters of carbonic acid. Particularly effective dihydroxy compounds are dihydroxydiarylalkanes, including those compounds that contain alkyl groups or chlorine atoms or bromine atoms at the ortho position in respect of the hydroxyl group. The following compounds are dihydroxydiarylalkanes which are to be preferred 4,4 dihydroxy 2,2 diphenylpropane bisphenol A , tetramethylbisphenol A, tetrachlorobisphenol A, tetrabromobisphenol A and bis 4 hydroxyphenyl p diisopropylbenzene. In addition to the polycarbonates, which can be prepared only from dihydroxydiarylalkanes, it is also possible to apply branched polycarbonates. For the preparation of polycarbonates of this grade part of the dihydroxy compound, for instance 0.2 2 moles Z, is replaced by a polyhydroxy compound. Polycarbonates of the aforementioned grade are described, for instance, in the United States patent specifications 3,028,365 2,999,835 3,148,172 3,271,368 2,970,137 2,991,273 3,271,367 3,280,078 3,014,891 and 2,999,846. If the polymer composition must have flame retarding properties, the whole or part of the polycarbonate component can advantageously consist of halogenated polycarbonate. The polycarbonate can be prepared as known per se, for instance as described in said patents. For the preparation of the graft copolymer, as well as the copolymer, the various known polymerization techniques can be applied, such as emulsion, suspension, mass and solution polymerization or com binations thereof, such as mass suspension, emulsion mass and emulsionsuspension polymerization. For the preparation of the graft copolymers preference is given to emulsion polymerization. In applying this technique very good high impact resistant products are obtained in a simple manner. The copolymer is preferably prepared in emulsion or suspension. In the emulsion polymerization process the usual techniques can be applied for the graft copolymers, as well as for the copolymer. In the polymerization in aqueous emulsion the usual auxiliaries required for that purpose must be used, such as emulsifiers, lye, salts, soaps, initiators, suchs as peroxides, and chain length regulators. Suitable chain length regulators are organosulphur compounds, such as the much used mercaptans, as well as the dialkyldixanthogens, diarylsuphides, mercaptothiazoles, tetra alkylthiurammono and disulphides and the like, separately or mixed together, as well as hydroxyl compounds, such as terpinolenes. In addition, the dimer of a methylstyrene or an a alkene with relatively long chain can be used as well. The commercially most usual chain length regulators are particularly the mercapto compounds, and of these the hydrocarbylmercaptans with 8 20 carbon atoms per molecule are now much used. More specifically preference is given to mercaptans with a tertiary alkyl group. The quantity of organosulphur compound may vary within wide limits, depending on the mixture chosen, the specific compound, polymerization temperature, emulsifier and other variables relating to the recipe. A good result can be achieved by using 0.01 5 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of monomer of organosuiphur compound, in which use preference is given to 0.05 2 parts. Suitable organosulphur compounds comprise n octylmercaptan, n dodecylmercaptan, tertiary dodecylmercaptan, tertiary nonylmercaptan, tertiary hexadecylmercaptan, tertiary octadecylmercaptan, tertiary eicosylmercaptan, secondary octylmercaptan, secondary tridecylmercaptan, cyclododecylmercaptan, cyclododecadienylmercaptan, arylmercaptan, such as l naphthalenethiol and the like, bis tetra methylthiuramdisulphide , 2 mercaptobenzathiazole and the like.Mixtures of these compounds can also be used. As emulsifier widely different compounds can be used, such as disproportionated rosin soap, fatty acid soap, mixtures of these compounds, arylsulphonates, alkylarylsulphonates and other suface active compounds and mixtures thereof. Non ionogenic emulsifiers, such as polyethers and polyols, can also be used. The quantities of the emulsifiers used depend on the grade, as well as on the reaction parameters and the concentrations of polymerizable monomer in the emulsion polymerization system. For the emulsion polymerization process suitable compounds supplying free radicals are organic or inorganic peroxides, hydroperoxides, azo compounds, as well as redox initiator systems. These compounds can be added at the beginning of the polymerization process.It is possible also to add these compounds partly at the beginning and partly in the course of the polymerization process. Preferably alkali or ammoniumpersalts and or redox systems are chosen as initiators. Mention must be made in particular of potassiumpersulphate, ammoniumpersulphate and sodiumpersulphate. Examples of suitable redox systems are persalts for instance perchlorates or persulphates , tertiary butylhydroperoxide, cumenehydroperoxide, diisopropylbenzenehydroperoxide and methylcyclohexylhydroperoxide, combined with reductants based on acids containing sulphur in a low valency condition, such as sodiumformaldehydesulphoxylate, bisuiphide, pyrosulphide, or with organic bases, such as triethanolamine, with dextrose, sodiumpyrophosphate and mercaptans or combinations thereof, optionally in combination with metal salts, such as ferrous sulphate. These initiators or initiator systems can be fed in one single dose, by steps or even gradually. If the copolymer is prepared in suspension, the auxiliairies customary for this process are used, such as suspending agents, chain length regulators and compounds supplying free radicals. Suitable suspending agents are polyvinyl alcohols, partly saponified polyvinylacetate, metalphosphate compounds that are hard to dissolve and the like. The chain length regulators and the compounds supplying free radicals can in principle be the same as in emulsion polymerization. In order to obtain a polymer composition having a good impact resistance preference is given to starting from a rubber latex having a weight average particle size d50, determined with electron microscope ranging from 0.05 to 0.70 jim. This, therefore, means that the preparation of the graft copolymer in such a case must be effected at least partly in emulsion. The process according to which this rubber latex is prepared is preferably so controlled that highly cross linked products are obtained.The gel content should preferably be higher than 70 x by weight determined in methylethylketone or toluene . With a high butadiene content of the rubber, this degree of crosslinking can be obtained by polymerizing to high degrees of conversion or by applying cross linking agents, i.e. ethyleneglycoldimethacrylate. If for the graft copolymerization no use is made of emulsion polymerization, rubbers prepared from solutions thereof in organic solvents can be used as well. In that case, however, it is desirable for the graft polymerization reaction to be performed for instance in the form of a mass suspension polymerization reaction. In those cases in which the rubbers are prepared by emulsion polymerization the emulsifiers, activators and polymerization auxiliaries used for the preparation of the copolymer or graft copolymers can be applied.Before the grafting reaction, the rubber latex must be degassed in order to suppress undesired reactions initiated by non converted monomer. Preference is given to the use of polybutadiene homopolymers or butadiene copolymers with a butadiene content of more than 60 X by weight. If other dienes, for instance isoprene, or the lower alkylesters of acrylic acid, are used as comonomers, the butadiene content of the rubber can be reduced to 30 Z by weight without any disadvantage occurring with respect to the properties of the polymer composition.In principle it is also possible to prepare the graft copolymers from saturated rubbers, for instance from ethylenevinylacetate copolymers with a vinylacetate content lower than 50 or from ethylene propylenediene terpolymers these dienes are not conjugated examples are 1,4 hexadiene, ethylidene norbornene, dicyclopentadiene , as well as acrylate rubber, chlorinated polyethylene or chloroprene rubber.Mixtures of two or more rubbers can be applied as well. The polyurethane may be elastomeric polyurethanes known in the art. These polyurethanes can be prepared by reaction of a diisocyanate and one or more dihydroxy compounds. The dihydroxy compounds may be the polyoxyalkyleneglycols built up from C24 oxyalkylene units, such as polyethyleneglycol, polypropyleneglycol and polytetramethyleneglycol, polylactonediols derived from a lactone containing 5 12 C atoms, such as for instance hydroxyl terminated polycaprolactone, polyoenantholactone, polyvalerolactone or copolylactones and hydroxyl terminated polyesters. In some embodiments a low molecular diol is used in addition to the said diol, which low molecular diol can function as chain length regulator. Dihydroxyl compounds having a molecuar weight of between 60 and 200 can be used. Examples are aliphatic unbranched diols, such as ethyleneglycol, 1,4 butanediol and 1,6 hexanediol, branched diols, such as 1,2 propyleneglycol and 2,2 dimethylbutanediol 1,4, low molecular polyalkyleneglycols, such as diethyleneglycol, triethyleneglycol, or cycloaliphatic diols, such as 1,4 hydroxymethyl cyclohexane. The diisocyanates are the usual aromatic, aliphatic or cycloaliphatic compounds in pure or crude form, such as toluenediisocyanates, 4,4 diisocyanatediphenylmethane, polyarylenepolyphenylisocyanates, isophoronediisocyanate and hexamethylene diisocyanate. The quantity of diisocyanate used is such that the total NCO OB ratio is about 1 1, for instance 1.00 1 to 1.05 1. Generally one or more catalysts accelerating the isocyanate reactions are used also. The most usual types are the polyamino compounds, for instance triethylenediamine, and tin containing compounds, for instance dibutyltindiacetate or dilaurate. The polyurethane component of the polymer composition has preferably been prepared on the basis of one or more polyesters with hydroxyl end groups. These polyesters in their turn may have been prepared either by condensation of approximately equivalent quantities of a glycol and a dicarboxylic acid or an anhydride therof , or by reaction of a lactone having at least 6 carbon atoms in the lactone ring and a small quantity of bifunctional initiator, such as a glycol and ami noalcohol or a diamine. In any case preference is given to the use of a polyester having a relatively high molecular weight, i.e. having a molecular weight of at least 1000. In the condensation of a glycol and a dicarboxylic acid the glycol preferably contains 2 6 carbon atoms. Suitable glycols are ethylene, tri methylene, tetra methylene, hexene and propyleneglycols.The dicarboxylic acid is preferably aliphatic and contains 2 8 carbon atoms, preferably cinnamic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid and the like. This condensation polymerization of these polyesters is performed as known in the art. If the polyester is prepared on the basis of a lactone, preference is given to the use of caprolactone. The polymerization can then be effected in a simple manner by mixing the lactone in the bifunctional initiator at elevated temperature, for instance between 120 200 OC. Preference is given to the use of a catalyst with a concentration of about 1 1000 to 1 2 Z wt . Various catalysts known in the art can be used.More detailed information about the preparation of polyesters on the basis of lactones can be found in the US patents 2,933,477 and 2,933,478. The linear dihydroxypolyesters described above can be reacted with an excess of a preferably aromatic diisocyanate, such as 4,4 diphenylmethanediisocyanate MDI or toluenediisocyanate TDI . In this reaction, which is performed preferably at a temperature of between 80 120 OC, a prepolymer is obtained consisting of a mixture of the excess of unreacted diisocyanate and a diisocyanate terminated polymer diol. This mixture can then be reacted with a chain length regulator in such ratios that all free isocyanate groups have reacted. The chain length regulator may be a glycol having a low molecular weight, such as ethyleneglycol, 1,4 butanediol and 1,6 hexamethyleneglycol. A very suitable polyurethane according to the present invention can be prepared from 1 molar equivalent of a dihydroxypolyester, 6 molar equivalents diisocyanate and 5 molar equivalents chain length regulator. Generally preference is given to applying 2 6 moles diisocyanate per mole dihydroxypolyester. The polyurethanes applied may be crosslinked. This can be achieved in a simple manner by using a slight excess of diisocyanate or by applying a trivalent or polyvalent compound. The polymer composition may also contain various additives, such as pigments, fillers, stabilizers, antioxidants, lubricants, antistatics, flame retarders and the like. The invention is elucidated by means of the following examples.Comparative example 1 and examples 2 and 3 Starting from a polycarbonate based on bisphenol A and carboxylic acid with an impact resistance of 80 according to ASTM D 256, an ABS with 37.5 wt polybutadiene rubber and a copolymer of styrene and acrylonitrile SAN , a number of mixtures were made. The ABS was made as follows. 37.5 parts by weight polybutadiene latex based on solid matter , 41.5 parts by weight styrene and 21 parts by weight acrylonitrile and 0.4 part by weight tertiary dodecylmercaptan were added to the reactor, which already contained water and rosin soap emulgator solution. Subsequently, cumenehydroperoxide with an activator system was added and the polymerization was started. After the polymerization the latex obtained was coagulated by means of calcium chloride. After washing out and drying, an ABS powder with 35 X wt polybutadiene was obtained. The copolymer of styrene and acrylonitrile SAN wt. ratio 70 30 was made as follows. Styrene and acrylonitrile were put in a reactor together with water and a suspension stabilizer. After addition of an oil soluble initiator the reaction was started. After completion of the reaction, the stabilizer was washed out by means of EC1 and water.As already described in, inter alia, the Netherlands patent application 8003798, the processing characteristics are related to the spiral flow length. The spiral flow length, in this connection, is the distance in cenr timetres which a polymer melt having a temperature of 240 OC on entry of mould covers, under an initial pressure of 742 kg cm2, in a mould kept at 80 C. This mould has ducts with a width of 20 mm and a thickness of 3 mm flat spiral length R. Ebneth, K. Böhm, Plastverarbeiter, 191, 1968, pp. 261 269 .Comparative example 1 Starting from 4000 parts by weight ABS, 1000 parts by weight SAN and 5000 parts by weight polycarbonate, a mixture was prepared from which test plates were injection moulded. During the petrol resistance test described the test plates show an elongation of 18 X. Of this mixture the spiral flow was measured according to the method described. The spiral flow length proved to be 46.9 cm. Example 2 Starting from 3800 parts by weight ABS, 950 parts by weight SAN and 4750 parts by weight polyearbonate, a second mixture was prepared with 500 parts by weight of a polyurethane Estane 58137, Goodrich added thereto as well. Of this mixture the petrol resistance and the spiral flow were measured. These showed a substantial improvement compared with the results of example 1. For the results see table. Example 3 This example was carried out in the same manner as example 2 except, however, that the quantities of the parts by weight were 3400 parts by weight ABS, 850 parts by weight SAN, 4250 parts by weight polycarbonate and 1500 parts by weight polyurethane.
