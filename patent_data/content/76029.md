# Induction motor torque control system.

## Abstract
A motor control system in which an actual torque indication is derived from the motor and compared with a reference, or demand, torque. From the difference signal is derived a stator M.M.F. in magnitude and position relative to a reference frame locked to the rotor. Orthogonal compo nents of this stator M.M.F. are derived and transformed to stator phase winding drive signals.
