## Description
IMPROVED LANTERN The present invention relates to a lantern which has been substantially improved in order to better its functionality and usefulness. More particularly the lantern of this invention has been especially conceived to fulfil its function as an instrument for illumination, leaving the hands of the user completely free so that with them the latter can carry out with greater facility the manipulations required in each case. For this purpose, the lantern provided is shaped in the manner of an eyeshade which can be adapted to the head of the user so that, as well as ensuring the object mentioned above of leaving free the hands of the user, it ensures at all times that the luminous beam is orientated in the same direction as the vision of the user. Another feature of the lantern of this invention is the fact that it is completly watertight, which permits its use under water. The relatively low weight and volume in conjunction with its ease of manipulation makes the lantern of the invention an instrument which is both useful and convenient. More particularly the lantern of the invention is constituted by a body based on three fundamental pieces which can be coupled together wit the interpolation of watertight joints which ensure the watertightness referred to earlier, and in which a are secured the various structural elements of the same.In the said body there is defined a rear wall of part cylindrical shape for fitting to the users forehead whilst at its front face there is a transparent wall, preferably a plastics sheet, which covers and protects a parabola which is likewise of part cylindrical shape but of curvature opposite to that of the rear wall. In a preferred embodiment, there is positioned in the interior of the body a lampholder for the illumination lamp, as well as a set of supply cells for the same, with the inclusion of an operating switch which, suitably waterproofed, is placed in the upper part of the body. With the lateral parts of the abovementioned body there is associated an elastic strap for fixing around the head and provided with means for altering its length. Preferably in correspondence with the front upper vertices of the said lateral faces there is pivotably connected to the said body an eyeshade capable of adopting a horizontal position, as a projection from the upper wall of the said body, or of being lowered onto the transparent front wall which protects the parabola, talus protecting in its tnrn the said transparent wall during periods of non use of the lantern. There will now be given a complete description of the said improved lantern, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which there is shown, by way of simple example and in no limiting sense, a preferred form of construction to which can be applied all those modifications of detail which do not alter fundamentally its essential features as defined in theClaims hereof. In the said drawings Figure 1 is an exploded view of the body of the improved lantern of the present invention Figure 2 is a front elevation of the lantern ofFigure 1 with its parabola removed so that there can be clearly seen the positioning of the housing for the lampholder and the supply cells Figure 3 is a plan view of the lantern of Figure 1 with the upper wall of the body removed to reveal its internal structure Figure 4 is a lateral elevation of the lantern ofFigure 1 in section and revealing its internal structure Figure 5 is a lateral elevation of the lantern ofFigure 1 in which the eyeshade appears in the extended condition and, shown in broken lines, in the folded condition in which it protects the lantern ana Figure 6 is a perspective view of the improved lantern of Figure 1. Referring to the Figures it can be seen how the lantern of the invention is constituted starting from a body having three parts 1,2,7 . An intermediate part 1 of prismatic rectangular shape is open at the front and rear, as can be seen in Figure 1, and at its rear opening receives a rear part 2 of the body, whose rear wall 3 is curved according to an imaginary cylindrical sector and is covered by a layer 4 of nylon foam to adapt to the forehead of the user. In this rear part 2 of the body there is seated a lampholder 5 , as well as lateral stops 6 for holding in place a parabola 7 which is chromed and constitutes the third part i.e. front part of the body provided with a corresponding central opening 8 positioned operatively in front of the lampholder 5 . The rear part 2 is connected to the intermediate part 1 with the interpolation of a watertight seal 9 , whilst after the positioning of the parabola 7 in the said intermediate part 1 , there is attached to the same a rectangular sheet of transparent plastic 10 , to act as a glass, again with the interpolation of a watertight seal 11 . The lateral zones of the rear part 2 , as can be seen in either of Figures 2 and 3, are intended for the positioning of the supply cells 12 for a lamp 13 . Preferably the cells are four in number and of 1.5 volts, said cells being duly connected to the lamp 13 through a switch 14 constituted by a tumbler with two positions. As can be seen in Figure 3, the lamp 13 is fixed in the lampholder 5 and in this position emerges substantially towards the concave zone of the parabola 7 . On the lateral walls of the intermediate part 1 are two bridge pieces 15 intended for securing, with the aid of respective fasteners, an elastic holding band 16 which passes about the head of the user and which is provided with a ring 17 for adjustment of its length. Likewise on the lateral walls of the intermediate part 1 , corresponding with its front upper vertices, there are situated respective studs 18 which provide an imaginary axis of pivoting for a foldable eyeshade 19 the height of which coincides with that of the front transparent plastic 10 which it has to cover and protect during periods of inoperation of the lantern. The eyeshield 19 contains abutments 20 near to its free corners capable of keying under pressure on small studs 21 provided in the lower lateral zones of the said intermediate part 1 , when the eyeshade adopts the position shown by reference in in Figure 5. Thus, the various integral parts of the body are coupled together hermetically by reason of the watertight joints 9 11 , at the same time as the switch 14 is duly sealed, so that the lantern can be submerged without the least problem. The small eyeshade 19 acts as an element of protection for the transparent plastic sheet 10 , when the lantern is not used as such. Further, the said lantern is easily fitted to the forehead of the user by means of the elastic positioning strap 16 , being extremely convenient as a result of the anatomical shaping of the rear wall 3 of its body and of the layer of nylon foam 4 with which said fitting wall is covered. The stops 6 provide proper fixing for the parabola 7 , whilst the cells 12 occupy dead spaces of the said body without requiring an increased volume for the same. The abovementioned cells 12 can be used in pairs, independently or together. Finally and as a functional feature of the lantern, from the operational point of view, it can be fixed to the head of the user by means of the elastic positioning band 16 , in the manner of an eyeshade, leaving free the two hands of the user for any type of operation which has to be carried out. The shape, dimensions and materials could be varied and, in general, they shall be accessory or secondary provided always that they do not alter, change or modify the invention as defined in the following claims.
