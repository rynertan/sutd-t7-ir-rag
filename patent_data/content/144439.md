# FLUID SERVO ACTUATOR.

## Abstract
A fluid servo actuator comprises an input member 30 which can be rotated by drive means 24 , 25 and which is provided with tubes 52 , 44 capable of supplying and discharging hydraulic fluid and grooves 53 a , 53 b , 53 c , 53 d communicating with the tubes an output member 4 which constitutes a shaft and which is provided with grooves 60 a , 60 b , 60 c , 60 d formed in the surface thereof facing the grooves in the input member and a tube 45 communi cating with the grooves 60 a , 60 b , 60 c , 60 d an outer case 21 , 22 , 23 which hermetically seals the output and input members and houses the drive means and working chambers 62a , 62b which are defined between the outer case and the output member and which communicate with the tube in the output member, and which enable the output member to rotate by the supply and discharge of hydraulic fluid flowing through the tube. This fluid servo actuator makes it possible to reduce the size of the actuator body and simplify the hydraulic piping.
