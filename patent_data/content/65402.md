# POLAROGRAPHIC OXYGEN SENSOR

## Abstract
A polarographic sensor for blood oxygen monitoring is defined by respective anode and cathode electrode wires fix edly maintained in conventional fashion. The end cross sec tions of the wires are carried on a surface, and overlying this surface is a capillary pore ultrafiltration membrane. The mic roscopic capillary pores, which have diameters less than 12 micrometers each, pass water therethrough and thus allow the blood, which passes on the side of the membrane opposite the anode and cathode, to act as its own electrolyte.
