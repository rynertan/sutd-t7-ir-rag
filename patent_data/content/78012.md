# Direct current dynamoelectric machine of permanent magnet type.

## Abstract
A d.c. dynamoelectric machine of permanent magnet type comprises an armature A and a plurality of field poles, wherein each of the poles comprises a main pole part a permanent magnet 2 composed by an integral combina tion of a first magnet 21 formed of a magnetic material having a large coercive force and a second magnet 22 formed of a magnetic material providing a high residual flux density and having an axial length L
