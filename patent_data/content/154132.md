The compounds of the general formula I and also the salts and esters thereof may exist in two optically active forms and it is to be understood that both such forms as well as racemic mixtures thereof are embraced by the present invention. It is believed that the more active form is that of structure IA in which R¹, R² and R³ are defined as above. Furthermore, in general formulae I and IA, it is thought to be advantageous that R¹ denotes the hetero aromatic group and that R² denotes a hydrogen atom. Examples of individual compounds according to the invention include A compound of the general formula I, or a salt or ester thereof, may be prepared by eliminating the elements of a compound of the general formula II in which in which R¹ and R² are defined as above, The compound of the general part formula III may suitably be a compound of the general part formula IIIA in which R¹, R² and X are defined as above. More especially it may be a compound of the general formula IIIB in which In the case where R¹³ and R¹⁴ in general formula IIIB together denote the remainder of a penem nucleus, they may suitably together denote the sub formula V in which In that case, the penem or penem intermediate of the general part formula III is of the general formula IIID given below. A carboxyl blocking group R Examples of suitable carboxyl blocking derivatives that may form the group CO₂R The salts may be organic or inorganic and need not be pharmaceutically acceptable. Examples of suitable salt forming groups R An ester forming group R The free carboxyl group may be regenerated from any of the above esters by usual methods appropriate to the particular R When it is desired to produce a compound of the general formula I in the form of a free acid or in the form of a salt, by a process according to the invention, it is generally advantageous to use a compound in which R The process step according to the invention involves the elimination of the elements of a compound H X from a penem or penem intermediate of the general part formula III, in which X denotes a hydroxy group or a leaving group. In the case where X denotes a hydroxy group, the compound of the formula H X being eliminated is water and the elimination reaction is a dehydration reaction, which may suitably be carried out by treating a compound of the general part formula III with a compound of the general formula VI in which In the compounds of the general formula VI, R⁶ and R⁷ are preferably selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, phenyl, and benzyl, the ethyl and isopropyl groups being preferred.

Advantageously, approximately two equivalents of each the compounds of the general formulae VI and VII are used per mole of the compound of the general part formula III. The dehydration reaction may suitably be carried out at a non extreme temperature, for example a temperature of from 20 C to 100 C. It may be convenient to begin the reaction at a depressed temperature, for example 0 C, and then to allow the temperature to rise to about room temperature. The reaction may suitably be carried out in an inert aprotic organic solvent. Suitable solvents include tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethyl acetate, benzene, and dichloromethane. In the cases where X, in general formula III, denotes a leaving group, which will hereinafter be referred to as X¹, it may suitably be a halogen atom or a group of one of the formulae Preferred groups of formula VIIIB are those in which n denotes zero and R¹¹ denotes C₁ ₆ alkyl, especially the acetoxy group. The elimination of the elements of a compound of the general formula II in which X denotes a leaving group X¹ from a compound of the general formula III,may suitably be effected by treating the compound of the general formula III with a base in an aprotic medium. Suitable bases for that purpose include, for example, powdered inorganic bases, for example alkali metal carbonates, bicarbonates, hydroxides, and hydrides e.g. powdered potassium carbonate , and also organic bases of low nucleophilicity, for example 1,8 diazabicyclo 5.4.0 undec 7 ene. Suitable solvents for use as the aprotic medium in this reaction include, for example, dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoramide, dichloromethane, and tetrahydrofuran. The elimination may suitably be effected at a low temperature, for example a temperature of from 70 C to 70 C, advantageously from 40 C to 0 C. The compounds of the general formula III in which X denotes a leaving group X¹ may suitably be prepared from the corresponding compound in which X denotes a hydroxy group by replacing the hydroxy group by a leaving group X¹. Alternatively, in the case of the compounds of the general formula IIID below, the leaving group X¹ may be introduced into the molecule at an earlier stage in the synthesis of the penem nucleus. In particular, a group X¹ of the formula VIIIA or VIIIB may be introduced at the beginning of, or at any stage during, the synthesis of the penem. In each case, the group X¹ may suitably be introduced by replacing a hydroxyl group in known manner. The dehydration or other elimination reaction of the process according to the invention may be carried out at any suitable stage during the preparation of the penem of the general formula I or salt or ester thereof, suitably at an early stage or late stage in the manufacturing process. Further examples of suitable leaving groups will be apparent to those skilled in the art and include sulphoxide, selenoxide and xanthate groups, which can be eliminated by known methods see W. Carruthers, Some modern methods of organic synthesis , Cambridge Univ. Press 1978 2nd edition , pages 93 103 . In particular, the dehydration or other elimination reaction may be carried out on a compound of the general formula IIIC in which in which, R¹, R², R¹⁷ and R¹⁸ are defined as above, which may then subsequently be converted to a penem of the general formula I or salt or ester thereof in known manner, suitably by a conventional penem preparation method.

In a compound of the general formula IIIB or IIIC, R¹³ or R¹⁷, respectively, may suitably denote a triphenylmethyl group. Examples of suitable N protecting groups, R¹⁴ or R¹⁸, include silyl groups, for example t butyldimethylsilyl groups. In the general formula IIID and IVD, the group R¹⁶ may be a group convertible into R³ during the penem preparation process. One particular example of such a group, which may conveniently be used in the preparation of a group R³ of the formula SR⁴ in which R⁴ is defined as above , is the group of the formula IX in which R¹⁵ denotes an organic radical different from the group R⁴. A sulphoxide compound of the general formula IIID or IVD in which R¹⁶ denotes a group of the formula IX may be reacted with a thiol of the general formula XI The reaction of the sulphoxide with the thiol may be carried out as described in European Patent Publication No. EP 0 046 363A.
