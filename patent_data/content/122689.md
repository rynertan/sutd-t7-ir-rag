# An alloy with constant modulus of elasticity.

## Abstract
This invention provides a CME alloy of Fe Ni Cr Ti Al Zr and one of Fe Ni Co Cr Ti Al Zr. The for mer CME alloy comprises from 40 to 44.5 by wt of Ni, from 4 to 6.5 by wt of chromium, from 0.5 to 1.9 by wt of Ti, from 0.1 to 1 by wt ofAl and from 0.2 to 2 by wt of Zr. The latter CME alloy comprises from 30 to 44.5 by wt Ni and from 0.4 to 15 by wt of Co, and the same amounts of the other metals as in the former CME alloy. A CME alloy comprising the components having the above defined con centrations has an upper temperature limit greater than 130 , at which temperature level its CME properties can be retained. The subject CMC alloy also has great mechanical strength. This mechanical strength is more greatly improved by the addition of from 0.1 to 5.5 by wt of one or more elements selected from the group consisting of Mo, Nb, Ta and W.
