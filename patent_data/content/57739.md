## Description
ULTRA HIGH EFFICIENCY CATALYST FOR POLYMERIZING OLEFINS AND PROCESS OF POLYMiRIZATION OF OLEFINS USING IT. This invention relates to new catalyst compositions useful for the polymerization of a olefins and to a polymerization process employing such catalyst compositions. It is well known that olefins such as ethylene, propylene and l butene can be polymerized in the presence of metallic catalysts, particularly the reaction products of organometallic compounds and transition metalrsompounds, to form substantially unbranched polymers of relatively high molecular weight.Typically, such polymerizations are carried out at relatively low temperatures and pressures with an inert organic liquid diluent or carrier. Followinglpolymeri zation, it is common to remove catalyst residues from the polymer by repeatedly treating the polymer with alcohol or other deactivating agent such as aqueous base. Such catalyst deactivation and or removal procedures are expensive both in time and material consumed as well as the equipment required to carry out such treatment. Most known catalyst systems are more efficient in preparing polyolefins in a slurry rather than in solution at a temperature high enough to solubilize the polymer in the carrier. The lower efficiencies of such catalysts in solution polymerization is believed to be caused by rapid depletion or deactivation at the significantly higher temperatures normally employed in solution processes. Also, processes involving the copolymerization of ethylene with higher a olefins exhibit catalyst efficiencies significantly lower than in ethylene homopolymerization. Recently, catalysts having higher efficiencies have been disclosed, e.g., U.S. Patents 3,392,159, 3,737,393, and 4,115,319 West German Patent Application 2,231,982 and British Patents 1,305,610, 1,358,437, and 1,492,379. While the increased efficiencies achieved by using these recent catalysts are significant, even higher efficiencies arg desirable, particularly in copolymerization processes. Also, higher reaction temperatures reduce the energy requirements, particularly in removing the solvent. The present invention in one aspect is a transition metal compound suitable for use in the preparation of olefin polymerization catalysts which is the reaction product or complex formed by mixing at a temperature and time sufficient to provide a color change a a transition metal compound having at least one hydrocarbyloxy group attached to said transition metal and b a zinc compound wherein the atomic ratio of Zn to transition metal Tm is at least 0.03 1, preferably from about 0.12 1 to 5 1 and most preferably from about 0.25 1 to 2 1. HigherZn Tm ratios can be employed, however, no particular advantage is observed and the higher levels increase the cost of catalysts produced therefrom. Another aspect of the present invention are catalysts for polymerizing a olefins which comprise the reaction product of a the above transition metal reaction product or complex b a magnesium halide resulting from the reaction of 1 an organomagnesium component and 2 a halide source and c an organoaluminum compound, if required. The components are employed in quantities which provide the composition with atomic ratios of the elements as follows Mg Tm is from 1 1 to 2000 1, preferably from 2 1 to about 200 1 and most preferably from 5 1 to 75 1. Al Tm is from 0.1 1 to 2000 1, preferably from 0.5 1 to 200 1 and most preferably from 1 1 to 75 1. Excess X A1 is from 0.0005 1 to 10 1, preferably from 0.002 1 to 2 1 and most preferably from 0.01 1 to 1.4 1. Excess X is the amount of halide above that amount theoretically required to convert the organomagnesium component to magnesium dihalide. The present invention is most advantageously practiced where an a olefin is polymerized, generally in the presence of hydrogen as a molecular weight control agent, in a polymerization zone containing an inert diluent and the catalytic reaction product.Especially advantageous is the copolymerization of ethylene and higher a olefins using the ultra high efficiency catalysts. The polymerization is most beneficially carried out under inert atmosphere and relatively low temperature and pressure, although very high pressures are optionally employed. Olefins which are suitably homopolymerized or copolymerized in the practice of this invention are aliphatic a monoolefins or a diolefins having from 2 to 18 carbon atoms. Illustrative of such a olefins are ethylene, propylene, butene l, pentene l, 3 methylbutene l, 4 methylpentene l, hexene l, octene 1, dodecene l, octadecene l, 1,7 octadiene, and mixtures thereof. It is understood that a olefins may be copolymerized with other a olefins and or with small amounts, i.e. up to about 25 weight percent based on the polymer, of other ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as styrene, a ethylstyrene and similar ethylenically unsaturated monomers which do not destroy conventional Ziegler catalysts.Most benefits are realized in the polymerization of aliphatic a monoolefins, particularly ethylene and mixtures of ethylene and up to 50, especially from 0.1 to 40 weight percent, of propylene, butene l, hexene l, octene l, 4 methylpentene l, 1,7 octadiene or similar higher a olefin or diolefin based on total monomer. Suitable zinc compounds advantageously employed are those represented by the formulae R2Zn or RZnX wherein each R is independently a hydrocarbyl group having from 1 to about 20, preferably from 1 to about 10, carbon atoms and X is a halogen, preferably chlorine or bromine. Particularly suitable zinc compounds include, for example, diethyl zinc, diphenyl zinc, ethyl zinc chloride, mixtures thereof and the like. Suitable transition metal compounds which can be employed in the present invention include those represented by the formulae Tm OR yXx and Tm OR x 20 wherein Tm is a transition metal selected from groupsIVB, VB or VIB each R is independently a hydrocarbyl group, preferably alkyl or aryl, having from 1 to 20, preferably from 1 to 10, carbon atoms each X is independently a halogen, preferably chlorine or bromine x has a value equal to the valence of Tm and y has a value from 1 to the valence of Tm. Particularly suitable transition metal compounds include for example tetraethoxy titanium, tetraisopropoxy titanium, tetra n butoxy titanium, di n butoxy titanium dichloride, tetraphenoxy titanium, tetra n propoxy titanium, tetra 2 ethylhexoxy titanium, tri n butyoxy vanadium oxide, oxyvanadium trichloride, tri isopropoxy vanadium oxide, zirconium tetra n butoxide, zirconium tetra n propoxide, zirconium tetra isopropoxide, and mixtures thereof. Suitable organomagnesium components which can be employed in the present invention include those represented by the formula MgR 2 xMR wherein each R is independently hydrocarbyl or hydrocarbyloxy, M is aluminum, zinc or mixtures thereof and x is about zero to about 10, preferably 0.001 to 5, most preferably from 0.15 to 2.5 and y denotes the number of hydrocarbyl and or hydrocarbyloxy groups which corresponds to the valence of M. As used herein, hydrocarbyl and hydrocarbyloxy are monovalent hydrocarbon radicals.Preferably, hydrocarbyl is alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkenyl and similar hydrocarbon radicals having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, with alkyl having 1 to 10 carbon atoms being especially preferred. Likewise, preferably, hydrocarbyloxy is alkoxy, cycloalkyloxy, aryloxy, aralkyloxy, alkenyloxy and similar oxyhydrocarbon radicals having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, with alkyloxy having 1 to 10 carbon atoms is preferred.Hydrocarbyl is preferred over hydrocarbyloxy. Preferably the organomagnesium compound is a hydrocarbon soluble dihydrocarbylmagnesium such as the magnesium dialkyls and the magnesium diaryls.Exemplary suitable magnesium dialkyls include particularly n butyl sec butyl magnesium, diisopropyl magnesium, di n hexyl magnesium, isopropyl n butyl magnesium, ethyl n hexyl magnesium, ethyl n butyl magnesium, di n octyl magnesium and others wherein the alkyl has from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Exemplary suitable magnesium diaryls include diphenylmagnesium, dibenzylmagnesium, and ditolylmagnesium. Suitable organomagnesium compounds include alkyl and aryl magnesium alkoxides and aryloxides and aryl and alkyl magnesium halides with the halogen free organomagnesium compounds being more desirable. Among the halide sources which can be employed are the active non metallic halides and metallic halides. Suitable non metallic halides are represented by the formula R X wherein R is hydrogen or an active monovalent organic radical and X is a halogen.Particularly suitable non metallic halides include, for example, hydrogen halides and active organic halides such as t alkyl halides, allyl halides, benzyl halides and other active hydrocarbyl halides wherein hydrocarbyl is as defined hereinbefore. By an active organic halide is meant a hydrocarbyl halide that contains a labile halogen at least as active, i.e., as easily lost to another compound, as the halogen of sec butyl chloride, preferably as active as t butyl chloride.In addition to the organic monohalides, it is understood that organic dihalides, trihalides and other polyhalides that are active as defined above are also suitably employed Examples of preferred active non metallic halides include hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, t butyl chloride, t amyl bromide, allyl chloride, benzyl chloride, crotyl chloride, methylvinyl carbinyl chloride, a phenylethyl bromide, diphenyl methyl chloride and the like. Most preferred are hydrogen chloride, t butyl chloride, allyl chloride and benzyl chloride. Suitable metallic halides which can be employed herein include those represented by the formula MRy aXa X wherein M is a metal of Groups IIB, IIIA or IVA, of Mendeleev s Periodic Table of Elements,R is a monovalent organic radical, X is a halogen, y has a value corresponding to the valence of M and a has a value from 1 to y. Preferred metallic halides are aluminum halides of the formula A1R3 aXa wherein each R is independently hydrocarbyl as defined above such as alkyl, X is a halogen and a is a number from 1 to 3. Most preferred are alkylaluminum halides such as ethylaluminum sesquichloride, diethylaluminum chloride, ethylaluminum dichloride, and diethylaluminum bromide, with ethylaluminum dichloride being especially preferred.Alternatively, a metal halide such as aluminum trichloride or a combination of aluminum trichloride with an alkyl aluminum halide or a trialkyl aluminum compound may be suitably employed. It is understood that the organic moieties of the aforementioned organomagnesium, e.g., R , and the organic moieties of the halide source, e.g., R andR , are suitably any other organic radical provided that they do not contain functional groups that poison conventional Ziegler catalysts. Preferably such organic moieties do not contain active hydrogen, i.e., those sufficiently active to react with theZerewitinoff reagent. In preparing the reaction product or complex of the present invention from the zinc and transition metal compounds, the two components are simply mixed together in a suitable solvent at any suitable temperature, usually from about 500C to 100 C, preferably from about OOC to 300C, for a time sufficient to cause a color change in the reaction mixture. The exact color change varies depending upon the particular components employed. The reaction time is also affected by the temperature and concentration of the reactants, e.g., lower temperatures and concentrations require longer times. The solvents which can be employed include those suitable for preparing the catalysts of this invention. Hydrocarbon solvents are most suitable. The magnesium halide can be preformed from the organomagnesium compound and the halide source or it can be prepared in situ in which instance the catalyst is prepared by mixing in a suitable solvent 1 the organomagnesium component 2 the halide source and 3 the reaction product or complex formed by mixing a said transition metal compound and b said zinc compound. The foregoing catalyst components are combined in proportions sufficient to provide atomic ratios as previously mentioned. In cases wherein neither the organomagnesium component nor the halide source contains aluminum or contains an insufficient quantity of aluminum, it is necessary to include in the total catalyst an aluminum compound such as an alkyl aluminum compound, e.g., a trialkyl aluminum, an alkyl aluminum halide or an aluminum halide. If polymerization temperatures below 1800C are employed, the atomic ratios of Al Ti may be from 0.1 1 to 2000 1, preferably from 1 1 to 200 1.However, when polymerization temperatures above 1800C are employed, the aluminum compound is used in proportions such that the Mg Al ratio is more than 0.3 1, preferably from 0.5 1 to 10 1, and Al Ti ratio is less than 120 1, preferably less than 50 1. The use of very low amounts of aluminum necessitates the use of high purity solvents or diluents in the polymerization zone. Further, other components present in the zone should be essentially free of impurities which react with aluminum alkyls. Otherwise, additional quantities of an organometallic compound as previously described, preferably an organoaluminum compound, must be used to react with such impurities.Moreover, it is understood that in the catalyst the aluminum compound should be in the form of trialkyl aluminum or alkyl aluminum halide provided that the alkyl aluminum halide be substantially free of alkyl aluminum dihalide.In the above mentioned aluminum compounds, the alkyl groups independently have from 1 to about 20, preferably from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms. When additional quantities of aluminum compound are employed, it can be added to the catalyst during preparation or the aluminum deficient catalyst can be mixed with the appropriate aluminum compound prior to entry into the polymerization reactor or, alternatively, the aluminum deficient catalyst and the aluminum compound can be added to the polymerization reactor as separate streams or additions. The foregoing catalytic reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of an inert diluent using the concentrations of catalyst components such that the catalytic slurry is from about 0.005 to 1.0 molar moles liter with respect to magnesium. Suitable inert organic diluents include liquified ethane, propane, isobutane, n butane, n hexane, the various isomeric hexanes, isooctane, paraffinic mixtures of alkanes having from 8 to 12 carbon atoms, cyclohexane, methy iyclopentane, dirnethylcyclohexane, dodecane, and industrial solvents composed of saturated or aromatic hydrocarbons such as kerosene, naphthas, etc., especially when freed of any olefin compounds and other impurities, and especially those having boiling points in the range from about 50 to 2000C.Also included as suitable inert diluents are benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, cumene, decalin and the like. Mixing of the catalyst components to provide the desired catalytic reaction product is advantageously carried out under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen, argon or other inert gas at temperatues in the range from about 1000 to 2000C, preferably from about 0 to 1000C. The period of mixing is not critical as a sufficient catalyst composition most often is formed within about one minute or less. In the preparation of the catalytic reaction product, it is not necessary to separate hydrocarbon soluble components from hydrocarbon insoluble components of the reaction product. To maximize catalyst efficiency, the catalyst is prepared by mixing the components of the catalyst in an inert liquid diluent in the following especially preferred order organomagnesium compound, halide source, the aluminum compound if required, and the reaction product or complex transition metal compound and zinc compound. In the polymerization process employing the catalytic reaction product, polymerization is effected by adding a catalytic amount of the catalyst to a polymerization zone containing a olefin monomer, or vice versa and maintaining the mixture at temperatures in the range from about 0 to 3000C, preferably at solution polymerization temperatures of about 1300 to 2500C, for a residence time of a few seconds to several days, preferably 15 seconds to 2 hours. A catalytic amount of the catalyst is generally about 0.0001 to 0.1 millimole titanium per liter of diluent.However, that the most advantageous catalyst concentration will depend upon polymerization conditions such as temperature, pressure, solvent and presence of catalyst poisons and the foregoing range is given to obtain maximum catalyst yields in weight of polymer per unit weight of titanium. Generally, a carrier which may be an inert organic diluent or solvent or excess monomer is employed. To realize the full benefit of the high efficiency catalyst of the present invention, care must be taken to avoid oversaturation of the solvent with polymer. If such saturation occurs before the catalyst becomes depleted, the full efficiency of the catalyst is not realized. For best results, it is preferred that the amount of polymer in the carrier not exceed about 50 weight percent based on the total weight of the reaction mixture. The polymerization pressures preferably employed are relatively low, e.g., from about 50 to 1000 psig 0.45 to 7.0 MPa , especially from about 100 to 700 psig 0.79 to 4.93 MPa . However, polymerization within the scope of the present invention can occur at pressures from atmospheric up to pressures determined by the capabilities of the polymerization equipment. During polymerization it is desirable to stir the polymerization recipe to obtain better temperature control and to maintain uniform polymerization mixtures througout the polymerization zone. In order to optimize catalyst yields in the polymerization of ethylene, it is preferable to maintain an ethylene concentration in the solvent in the range of from about 1 to about 10 weight percent, most advantageously from about 1.2 to about 2 weight percent. To achieve this, when an excess of ethylene is fed into the system, a portion of the ethylene can be vented. Hydrogen can be employed in the practice of this invention to control the molecular weight of the resultant polymer. For the purpose of this invention, it is beneficial to employ hydrogen in concentrations ranging from about 0.001 to about 1 mole per mole of monomer. The larger amounts of hydrogen within this range are found to produce generally lower molecular weight polymers. Hydrogen can be added with a monomer stream to the polymerization vessel or separately added to the vessel before, during or after addition of the monomer to the polymerization vessel, but during or before the addition of the catalyst. The monomer or mixture of monomers is contacted with the catalytic reaction product in any conventional manner, preferably by bringing the catalytic reaction product and monomer together with intimate agitation provided by suitable stirring or other means. Agitation can be continued during polymerization, or in some instances, the polymerization can be allowed to remain unstirred while the polymerization takes place. In the case of more rapid reactions with more active catalysts, means can be provided for refluxing monomer and solvent, if any of the latter is present, in order to remove the heat of reaction. In any event, adequate means should be provided for dissipating the exothermic heat of polymerization. If desired, the monomer can be brought in the vapor phase into contact with the catalytic reaction product, in the presence or absence of liquid material.The polymerization can be effected in the batch manner, or in a continuous manner, such as, for example, by passing the reaction mixture through an elongated reaction tube which is contacted externally with suitable cooling media to maintain the desired reaction temperature, or by passing the reaction mixture through an equilibrium overflow reactor or a series of the same. The polymer is readily recovered from the polymerization mixture by driving off unreacted monomer and solvent if any is employed. No further removal of impurities is required. Thus, a significant advantage of the present invention is the elimination of the catalyst residue removal steps.In some instances, however, it may be desirable to add a small amount of a catalyst deactivating reagent of the types conventionally employed for deactivatingZiegler catalysts. The resultant polymer is found to contain insignificant amounts of catalyst residue and to possess a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution. The following examples are given to illustrate the invention. All percentages are by weight and all parts are by molar or atomic ratio unless otherwise indicated. In the following examples, the melt index values 12 and I10 were determined by ASTM D 1238 70 and the density values were determined by ASTM D 1248. EXAMPLES 1 5 A.
