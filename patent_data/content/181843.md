# ROTARY STAND

## Abstract
An improved rotary stand, particularly intended to be used as a work table to support a table computer terminal and comprising a disc which is rotatably mounted on a thrust bearing. The disc is provided with a pull out leaf. The leaf is movable between an inner end position for use when the stand is to be rotated, and an outer end position for use when work is to be carried out on the computer terminal. In the inner position the leaf will be located interiorly of the edge of the stand in order not to prevent the rotational movements of the latter. The leaf is provided with feet which in the outer position of the leaf are arranged to abut against the support.
