# Circuits and processes for initializing the loop current of a telephone set.

## Abstract
The loop current Ix of a telephone set speech network 11 is automatically initialized at a desired level independent of the central office voltage applied to the input terminals 12, 13 of the set and thus independent of transmission line loop length and other variables. For this purpose. a variable con ductance device 20 , such as a Darlington driver Q1 , is connected between the input terminals and the speech net work so as to establish a loop current at a circuit node N1 that is a function of the supply voltage and the conductivity of the device. The loop current is monitored, as by a Schmidt trigger circuit 30 , and the conductance of the device 20 is varied accordingly so as to initialize the loop current at the desired level, as by selectively connecting a plurality of resistors R2 ...R7 individually and collectively between a base node 26 of the driver Q1 and the ring lead 17 of the set.
