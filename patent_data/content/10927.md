# Improved method of producing ethanol water azeotrope from crude ethanol.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for purifying crude ethanol, whether produced by fermentation or by the syn thetic route, to produce a pure ethanol water azeotrope. The process uses only two distillation columns for fermen tation ethanol and only three columns for synthetic ethanol because the latter has diethyl ether as impurity. The inven tive concept lies in the design and specification of the col umns and the specific distillation conditions which enable each of the impurities in ethanol to be reduced below 1 ppm. Ethanol of such purity is most desirable when used for potable or pharmaceutical purposes.
