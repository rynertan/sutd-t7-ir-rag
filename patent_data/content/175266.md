EP A 88350 discloses carboxyalkyl dipeptides substituted with groups containing one sulfamoyl group which are useful as antihypertensive agents in the treatment of congestive heart failure and glaucoma. EP A 80822 discloses armethyleneoxy substituted peptides havinq antihypertensive activity. The present invention comprises a compound of the formula I Preferred substituents within the scope of the present invention include those wherein Y₁ and Y₂ are independently hydroxy, alkoxy containing up to 8 carbon atoms or phenyl C₁ ₆ alkoxy In the preferred embodiment, ring G is pyrrole, or a pyrrole ring containing one carbon carbon double bond. In a preferred embodiment when G forms a fused ring system, X₁ and X₂ and T form tetrahydroquinoline or tetrahydroisoquinoline, or X₁ and X₂ form a pyrrole ring. The pyrrole ring of the one ring or two ring system G is preferably unsubstituted or substituted with an R₃ group which is preferably OH or alkyl containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms. When the chain connecting the moiety M to the ring includes a CH₂ M is preferably A is preferably NH₂ OH OCH₂COOH phenoxy furfurylamino alkoxy having up to 6 carbon atoms or SO₂NR₁R₂ wherein R₁ and R₂ are hydrogen, methyl, or C₂ ₃ alkyl, and more preferably SO₂NH₂. B is preferably halogen, and more preferably chloro CH₃ or SO₂NR₁R₂ wherein R₁ and R₂ are hydrogen, methyl, or C₂ ₃ alkyl, and more preferably SO₂NH₂ and E is preferably halogen or hydrogen. Z is preferably The alkyl groups in general include straight chained and branched groups, including methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, tert butyl, amyl, iso amyl and hexyl. By halogen is meant chloro, bromo, iodo and fluoro. Preferred substitutents for R₁ and or R₂ also include cycloalkyl groups, aryl groups, heterocyclic groups, and fused aryl cycloalkyl groups, as defined herein. The preferred cycloalkyl groups include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, adamantyl, or norbornyl. The preferred aryl and fused aryl cycloalkyl groups include phenyl, indolyl, indolinyl, indanyl, naphthyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, and decahydronaphthyl.

Preferred aryl alkyl substituents include benzyl and phenethyl. Preferred substituents on the alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, and fused aryl cycloalkyl substituents include alkyl and alkoxy with 1 to 6 carbon atoms, CF₃, OH, NH₂, phenoxy, NR₁R₂, COOH, CN, SH, halogen, NO₂, and COOR, particularly COO C₁ ₆ alkyl. Compounds according to formula I can contain asymmetric centers at the carbon atoms marked thus C . Each of these carbon atoms can have an R or an S configuration, and preferably S . Individual optical diastereoisomers as well as mixtures thereof are considered to be within the scope of this invention. When diastereoisomeric products result from the synthetic procedures, the desired diastereoisomeric product can be separated by conventional chromatographic or fractional crystallization methods. The compounds of formula I can be prepared by coupling compounds of formulas II and III It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that the coupling of compounds II and III can be carried out by conventional peptide linkage techniques, e.g. in the presence of a coupling agent such as DCC N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or CDI N,N carbonyldiimidazole . Alternately, one may prefer to convert the COOH group of compound II to C O Cl, and then react the resulting intermediate with compound III . Alternately one may preferably convert the compound II to the corresponding N carboxyanhydride NCA by allowing II to react with phosgene, and then react the resulting N carboxyanhydride with compound III to yield the desired intermediate. it will further be recognized that the nitrogen atom which is between the carbon atoms to which R₁ and R₂ are attached can be protected with a blocking group such as 2,2,2 trichloroethoxycarbonyl or benzyloxycarbonyl. The protecting group is subsequently removed, preferably after compounds II and III have been joined together. other nitrogen atoms, in substituents such as NH₂ CH₂ ₄, should be protected and then deprotected in a similar manner. Similarly, Y₁ and Y₂ are preferably converted to ethoxy, t butoxy, or benzyloxy, before the intermediates are reacted. If the free acid is desired, it is subsequently obtained by removal of the esterifying group in a known manner. The compounds of the present invention in which one of Y₁ and Y₂ is OH and the other is alkoxy, such as methoxy or ethoxy, are preferably made by reacting compounds II and III as shown above in which one of Y₁ and Y₂ is the desired alkyl ester, and the other is an easily cleaved ester group such as t butoxy. The amide intermediate thus prepared yields upon a mild acid hydrolysis the desired monoester monoacids. When Q contains sulfur, the preferred synthetic route is via the acid chloride. Alternately, compounds of formula I can be prepared by introducing by substitution or condensation reactions the substituent Z onto the remaining moiety of the formula I compounds For example, The compounds of this invention form salts with various inorganic and organic acids and bases which are also within the scope of the invention. Such salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts like sodium and potassium salts which are preferred , alkaline earth metal salts like the calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases e.g., dicyclohexylamine salts, N methyl D glucamine and salts with amino acids like arginine or lysine. Also, salts with organic and inorganic acids may be prepared, e.g., HCl, HBr, H₂SO₄, H₃PO₄, as well as methanesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, maleic, acetic, malic, citric, fumaric and camphorsulfonic acids. The non toxic physiologically acceptable salts are preferred, although other salts are also useful, e.g., in isolating or purifying the product. The salts may be formed by conventional means, as by reacting the free acid or free base forms of the product with one or more equivalents of the appropriate base or acid in a solvent such as water which is then removed The action of the enzyme renin on angiotensinogen, a pseudoglobuline in blood plasma, produces the decapeptide angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is converted by angiotensin converting enzyme ACE to the octapeptide angiotensin II. The latter is an active pressor substance which has been implicated as the causative agent in various forms of hypertension in various mammalian species, e.g., rats and dogs. The compounds within the scope of this invention which intervene in the renin to angiotensin I to angiotensin II sequence inhibit angiotensin I converting enzyme and therefore are useful in reducing or relieving hypertension. Furthermore, the compounds within the scope of the present invention which possess diuretic activity promote relief from hypertension by promoting diuresis, and consequently have utility in treating congestive heart failure. Compounds within the scope of this invention can also simultaneously possess ACE inhibitory and diuretic activity, which is particularly unexpected in view of the fact that such simultaneous activity cannot be predicted from prior art compounds. Thus by the administration of a composition containing one or a combination of compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, hypertension in the species of mammal suffering therefrom is alleviated. A single dose, or preferably two to four divided daily doses, provided on a basis of about 0.1 to 100mg per kg per day, preferably about 1 to 50mg per kg per day, is appropriate to reduce blood pressure. The substance is preferably administered orally, but a parenteral route such as subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intravenously or intraperitoneally can also be employed. The compounds of this invention are also indicated for use in reducing intraocular pressure, e.g., for treating glaucoma. This effect is obtained by administering the amounts indicated above to a host in need of such treatment. The compounds of the invention can be utilized by formulating one or more of them in compositions such as tablets, capsules or elixirs for oral administration or in sterile solutions or suspension for parenteral administration. About 10 to 500mg of a compound or mixture of compounds of formula I or physiologically acceptable salt s thereof is compounded with a physiologically acceptable vehicle, carrier, excipient, binder, preservative, stabilizer, or flavor, in a unit dosage form as called for by accepted pharmaceutical practice. The amount of active substance in these compositions or preparations is such that a suitable dosage in the range indicated is obtained. Illustrative of the adjuvants which may be incorporated in tablets, capsules and the like are the following a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin an excipient such as dicalcium phosphate a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch or alginic acid a lubricant such as magnesium stearate a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen or cherry. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain in addition to materials of the above type a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propyl parabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Sterile compositions for injection can be formulated according to conventional pharmaceutical practice by dissolving or suspending the active substance in a vehicle such as water for injection, a naturally occurring vegetable oil like sesame oil, coconut oil, peanut oil or cottonseed oil, or a synthetic fatty vehicle like ethyl oleate. Buffers, preservatives and antioxidants can be incorporated as required. Specific embodiments of the invention are illustrated in the following Examples.
