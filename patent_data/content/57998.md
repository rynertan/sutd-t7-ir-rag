The reductive conditions mentioned above may for example be the conditions for catalytic reduction in the presence of such a metal catalyst as platinum, palladium,Raney nickel, rhodium or the like as either supported on a suitable supporting medium or unsupported conditions for reduction with a metal hydride such as lithium aluminum hydride, lithium borohydride, lithium cyanoborohydride, sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride or the like conditions for reduction with a metal such as sodium metal or magnesium metal and an alcohol conditions for reduction with a metal such as iron or zinc and an acid such as hydrochloric acid or acetic acid conditions for electrolytic reduction or conditions for reduction with a reductase.The above reaction is generally conducted in the presence of water or an organic solvent e.g. methanol, ethanol, ethyl ether, dioxane, methylene chloride, chloroform, benzene, toluene, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, etc. .The reaction temperature is generally within the range of about 20 to 1000C, although it depends on the reductive conditions employed. While this reaction can be conducted satisfactorily at atmospheric pressure, it may also be conducted at supratmospheric or subatmospheric pressure.In order that the dehydrative condensation of II and III , which is likely to be a first phase of the present reaction, may be carried through successfully, a dehydrating agent such as anhydrous magnesium sulfate, anhydrous sodium sulfate or a molecular sieve may be added to the reaction system. The compound I in which R3 and or R4 is hydrogen, i.e. a free dicarboxylic or monocarboxylic acid, can also be produced for example by hydrolysis of a corresponding ester compound. Catalytic reduction may be an alternative procedure when the ester is the benzyl or diphenylmethyl ester, for instance. The hydrolysis of such an ester compound may be carried out under the conventional hydrolytic conditions, for example, permitting an acid e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrobromic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, etc. or a base e.g.sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, triethylamine, etc. to act on the ester in water or an organic solvent such as an alcohol e.g. methanol, ethanol, etc. or an ether e.g. tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, etc. or a mixture thereof at a temperature within the range of about 100 to 1500C. On the other hand, the catalytic reduction can be carried out with the aid of a catalyst such as platinum, palladium oncarbon, Raney nickel or the like in the presence of water or an organic solvent or a mixture thereof. Although this reaction proceeds satisfactorily at atmospheric temperature and pressure, it may also be conducted at elevated pressure or and elevated temperature conditions, if necessary. The compound I can also be produced by subjecting a compound of the formula EMI5.1 wherein Cyl, R1 R2 R3 and R4 are as defined hereinbefore and Z is a protective group which can be eliminated by hydrolysis or catalytic reduction, to hydrolysis or catalytic reduction. As the protective group that can be eliminated by hydrolysis, as designated by Z in IV , theremay be employed substantially all kinds of acyl groups as well as trityl, although benzyloxycarbonyl, tert butoxycarbonyl, trifluoroacetyl, trityl, etc., in particular, are suitable for ensuring comparatively mild reaction conditions. The protective group that can be eliminated by catalytic reduction, as also designated by Z, may for example be benzyl, diphenylmethyl or benzyloxycarbonyl.The hydrolysis reaction in this process is conducted in water or an organic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, dioxane, pyridine, acetic acid, acetone or methylene chloride, or a mixture therof, with or without addition of an accelerator agent such as an acid e.g. hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, hydrofluoric acid, sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, etc. or a base e.g. sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, sodium acetate, triethylamine, etc. . The reaction temperature may generally be about 10 to 1500C.The catalytic reduction in this process is conducted in water or an organic solvent e.g. methanol, ethanol, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, etc. , or a mixture thereof and in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as platinum, palladiumon carbon, etc. This reaction is conducted at atmospheric pressure or an elevated pressure of about 150 kg cmê at the maximum and at a temperature that may range from room temperature to about 1500C, although the reaction generally proceeds satisfactorily even at atmospheric temperature and pressure. The compound I can also be produced by reacting a compound II with a compound of the formula EMI6.1 wherein R2 and R3 are as defined hereinbefore and X is halogen or a group of the formula R5SO2 0 in which R5 is lower C1 4 alkyl, phenyl or p tolyl. This reaction proceeds as the two reactant compounds are maintained in a suitable solvent at a temperature between 10 and 1500C. For the purpose of accelerating the reaction, a base such as potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, sodium hydrogen carbonate, pyridine, triethylamine or the like may be added to the reaction system. The product compound I of this invention can be isolated from the reaction mixture by per se conventional separation and purification procedures such as extraction, concentration, filtration, recrystallization, column chromatography and thin layer chromatography. The compound I may be occuring in two or more stereoisomeric forms depending on the species of alicyclic group Cyl and also on the presence or absence of substitutents R1 and R2. Such isomers, severally or as a mixture, also fall within the scope of this invention and, if desired, each of the isomers may be produced independently.For example, by conducting the above mentioned reactions using one of the isomers of starting compounds II and IV , there can be produced one of the isomers of compound I .Or when the product compound is a mixture of two or more isomers, it can be resolved or otherwise separated into the individual isomers by per se conventional procedures, for example through the formation of sates with optically active acids e.g. camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, etc. or optically active bases e.g.cinchonine, cinchonidine, quinine, quinidine, a methylbenzylamine, dehydroabietylamine, etc. , chromatography, fractional recrystallization, etc. When such isomers are asymmetrical with respect to carbon atoms carrying substituents R1 and R2 the isomer having an S configuration tends to be more satisfactory as far as the following pharmacological properties are concerned. The above described alicyclic compounds I and salts according to this invention show such biological activities as inhibitory activities to angiotensin converting enzyme, bradykinin decomposing enzyme Kininase and enkephalinase in animals, especially in mammals e.g man, dog, cat, rabbit, guinea pig, rat, etc. , and are of value as diagnostic prophylactic and therapeutic drugs for hypertension or as analgesics or analgesic synergists.These compounds are low toxic, absorbed well on oral administration and stable enough and, therefore, for such clinical applications as mentioned above, can be safely administered orally or parenterally, either as they are or as formulated with suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipients or diluents, in such dosage forms or as such pharmaceutical compositions as powders, granules, tablets, capsuls, injections, etc. The dosage depends on the patient s condition and the route of administration to be used. When the compound of this invention or said composition thereof is administered to an adult patient for the treatment of hypertension, the proper dosage is generally about 0.02 to 20 mg kg per dose or preferably about 0.2 to 2 mg kg per dose for oral administration and about 0.002 to 0.2 mg kg or preferably about 0.02 to 0.2 mg kg for intravenous injection.About 2 to 5 doses are preferably given daily according to the patient s condition.

Experiment 1 Inhibitions of Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme ACE by the Compounds of this Invention. Experimental Method The experiment was conducted in accordance with a modification ofthe method described by Cushman et al. Biochemical Pharmacology, Vol. 20, 1637 1971 . That is, using hippuryl L histidyl L leucine HHL as the substrate, the ACE inhibitory activity was determined in terms of percent inhibition on the amount of hippuric acid produced by ACE when the present compound was added. A solution of the compound of the present invention dissolved in a0.02 to 0.5 dimethyl sulfoxide 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer solution pH 8.3, containing 300 mM sodium chloride was added to 100 p1 of ACE protein concentration, 20 mg ml and 100 ijl of 1.25 mM HHL. In this experiment, a potassium phosphate buffer solution containing dimethyl sulfoxide at a concentration equal to that of the test solution was used as a control.After incubating the solution at 370C for one hour, 150 ul of 1N hydrochloric acid was added to the solution to terminate the reaction. After 1 ml of ethyl acetate was added, the solution was centrifuged at 3000 r.p.m. for 10 minutes. A 0.5 ml aliquot was separated from the ethyl acetate layer and dried at a temperature below 500C under nitrogen gas streams. The residue was mixed with 5 ml of 1 M aqueous sodium chloride and the mixture was subjected to colorimetry at a wavelength of 228 nm.Test Result The test results obtained with respect to the compounds of Examples 1, 2, 7,13, 17 and 19 are shown in Table 1 below.

Experimental Method Male rats Sprague Dawley weighing 250 g to 350 g which were fed under free access to drinking water and feeds were used as experimental animals. The rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal administration of pentobarbital sodium 50 mg kg on the day before the test day and a polyethylene tube was inserted into each of the femoral artery for measurement of blood pressure and the femoral vein for injection of angiotensin I and II, and then the tubes were fixed. On the test day, an average blood pressure in the control phase was recorded on an electric hemodynamometer MP 4T model manufactured by Nippon Koden, Japan and thereafter angiotensin I and then angiotensin II were injected through the femoral vein at a dose of 300 ng kg and 100 ng kg respectively, to measure the hypertensive activity. Then, 13.8 UM kg of the compound of this invention was administered orally as an aqueous solution or an aqueous gum arabic suspension, and 20, 60 and 120 minutes after the administration, angiotensin I and II were injected repeatedly to trace hypertensive reactions. In calculating the percent inhibition to the hypertensive activity of angiotensin I, the percent inhibitory value was corrected based on the variation with time in the hypertensive reaction by angiotensin II.Test Result The test resutls obtained with respect to the compounds of Examples 1, 2, 12 and 13 are shown in Table 2 below.
