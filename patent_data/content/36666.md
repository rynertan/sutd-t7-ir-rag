# Remote load selector.

## Abstract
Circuitry for applying electrical power to one or more load devices under control of a remotely located manually operable switch coupled to the circuitry by a single power transmission line. The circuitry responds to sequential toggling of the remotely located switch to, for example, in a first state apply power to a first load, in a second state apply power to the second load, and in a third state apply power to both first and second loads.
