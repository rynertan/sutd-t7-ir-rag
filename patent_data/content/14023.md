# Method for producing crystalline aluminosilicates.

## Abstract
Crystalline aluminosilicates containing an organic nitrogen cation are prepared by mixing a source of silica, a source of alumina, a source of alkali metal, water and one or more substituted neopentyl amines having the for mula The aluminosilicates are used as catalyst supports in various organic conversion reactions. Catalytic composi tions are prepared therefrom by depositing thereon one or more metal oxides.
