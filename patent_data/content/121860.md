# Improved stretch wrap film dispenser.

## Abstract
Stretch wrap film is wound on a mandrel or core 14 which is longer than the roll of film 12 to extend out of both ends. A rotatable handle 20, 22 is mounted on the core out board of the film. Relative braking between the handle and core is adjusted by means of a screwthread which tightens a friction brake. The dispenser is carried around an article to be wrapped and the tension of the film is controlled by adjusting the brake by rotating its controlling nut. With a large core, an extension can be attached to a plug therein. Furthermore, in stead of a spiral surface as on a nut and stud, a spring may be used to control brake force.
