# GNRH ANTAGONISTS

## Abstract
Peptides which inhibit the secretion of gonadotropins by the pituitary gland and inhibit the release of steroids by the gonads. Administration of an effective amount prevents ovula tion of female mammalian eggs and or release of steroids by the gonads. The peptides have the structure X R₁ WlD Phe R₃R₄R₅R₆ V R₇ Arg Pro R₁₀ wherein X is hydrogen or an acyl group having 7 or less carbon atoms R₁ is dehydro Pro, Pro, D pGlu, D Phe, D Trp or β D NAL W is F, Cl, Cl₂, Br, NO₂ or C
