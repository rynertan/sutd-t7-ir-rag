# Target apparatus and method of storing information concerning the position or shape of a target in a calculating device.

## Abstract
In a target equipment in which transducers are provided to detect the pressure wave generated by a projectile the transducers 3 being connected to a timing and calculating device 5 adapted to calculate from the time delays between the instants of reception of the pressure wave the trajectory of the projectile, a signal transmitter 9 comprising a spark generator, is used to transmit sonic signals which are detected by the transducers 3 . The signal transmitter 9 can be used to indicate the precise location or shape of the target and this information is stored 11 in the computer memory.
