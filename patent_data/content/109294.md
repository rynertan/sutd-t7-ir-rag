## Description
CEPHALOSPORIN ESTERS This invention relates to a compound of the formula EMI1.1 wherein m is an integer of 0 or 1 n is an integer of 2 to 5, inclusive or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, particularly an acid addition salt and to a process for producing the same. It also relates to a pharmaceutical composition and an antibiotic use thereof. For the purpose of increasing the absorption into the body after oral administration of the non ester form of compound I , i.e. 7ss 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl acetamido 3 L i 2 dimethylaminoethyl 1H tetrazol 5yl thio methyl ceph 3 em 4 carboxylic acid which is hereinafter referred to briefly as compound II U.S.Patent No. 4080498 , it has been proposed to convert II into a straight chain or branched alkylcarbonyloxyalkyl ester such as the pivaloyloxymethyl ester, U.S. Patent No.4189479 and Japanese Published Unexamined Patent ApplicationNo. 77690 1982 published on May 15, 1982 . However, a further improvement has been demanded in the aspects of absorption, stability, etc. The present inventors have found through investi gation of a series of ester derivatives of compound II , that the compound of formula I or an acid addition salt thereof can be absorbed well through the gastrointestinal tract until the unesterified form of compound I is liberated soon after the absorption and is well transferred into the circulation to produce a high blood level of compound II . They have also found that the c w oun I is effective as an orally administrable broadspectrum antibiotic having activity not only against gram positive and gram negative bacteria but also active against resistant strains thereof.It is also found that conversion of this compound I to an acid addition salt increases the water solubility of the ester to thereby improve its rate of absorption, stabilizes compound I and facilitates both the isolation of compound I and the pharmaceutical processing thereof. Referring to the above cephalosporin compound I according to the present invention, the group represented by the formula EMI2.1 wherein m and n are as defined hereinbefore at the carboxy ester moiety in 4 position of the cephalosporin nucleus is a cycloalkyl group containing 3 to 6 carbon atoms such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, etc. or a cycloalkylmethyl group of 4 to 7 carbon atoms such as cyclopropylmethyl, cyclobutylmethyl, cyclopentylmethyl, cyclohexylmethyl, etc. Preferred species are cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyclopentylmethyl and cyclohexylmethyl, with cyclopentylmethyl and cyclohexylmethyl being the most preferred. Since compound I is basic in itself, it can be converted to acid addition salts. Generally, one molar equivalent of compound I forms an acid addition salt with 1 or 2 molar equivalents of an acid. Preferred examples of the acid that can be used for the formation of such acid addition salt include acids which are generally known to provide pharmaceutically acceptable salts in the field of penicillins and cephalosporins.Thus, for example, such inorganic acids as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, etc. and such organic acids as maleic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, malonic acid, fumaric acid, benzoic acid, mandelic acid, ascorbic acid, methanesulfonic acid, etc. may be mentioned. The acid addition salt of compound I is preferably the monohydrochloride or dihydrochloride, and preferably the dihydrochloride. The aminothiazole group of compound I or acid addition salt thereof may exist as an iminothiazoline group which is a tautomer thereof.Since the compound I or acid addition salt thereof contains an asymmetric carbon atom in the 4 carboxy ester moiety of the cephalosporin nucleus, it may exist as two optical isomers D and L isomers . Therefore, the compound I or acid addition salt thereof may be used optionally in the form of a racemic compound, either theD isomer or the L isomer, or a mixture of optional proportions of such isomers. The compound I and acid addition salt thereof are absorbed well from the gastrointestinal tract and, upon absorption, its 4 carboxy ester moiety is rapidly hydrolyzed by the enzymes in the body to give the non ester form of compound I , that is compound it . As described in Antimicrobial Agent and Chemotherapy 14, 557 568 1978 , this compound II has strong antibiotic activity. Thus, the compound II is highly active against gram positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, etc.and gram negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli,Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus morganii. When administered by the oral route, the compound I yields a high concentration in blood and it is effective for the treatment of infections in human and other mamalia caused by said bacteria, for example respiratory or urinary infections. The compound I or an acid addition salt thereof according to the present invention is low in toxicity LD50 L 3 g kg, mice, oral and can orally be administered, and can be formulated into capsules, powders, fine granules, granules or tablets, etc., in admixture with the common pharmaceutically acceptable excipients e.g. starch, lactose, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, etc., binders e.g. starch, gum arabic, carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, crystalline cellulose, etc., lubricants e.g. magnesium stearate, talc, etc., or and disintegrators e.g. carboxymethylcellulose calcium, talc, etc., in accordance with the established pharmaceutical procedure.Granules can also be produced by blending the compound I or acid addition salt thereof with about 1 to 5 molar equivalents of a solid organic acid, e.g. citric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, ascorbic acid, mandelic acid, etcSuch granules can be further processed into capsules, tablets, etc. by the established pharmaceutical procedure. The recommended dosage of compound I or acid addition salt thereof is 0.3 to 5 grams and preferably 0.5 to 3 grams per day per adult human, given in 3 to 4 divided doses. The compound I or acid addition salt thereof can be produced by known methods per se i.e. the processes described in U.S. Patents 4080498 and 4189479 and JapanesePublished Unexamined Patent Application No. 77690 82, for instance. The compound I or a salt thereof can also be produced by esterifying compound II or a salt thereof with a compound of the formula EMI5.1 wherein X is a halogen atom m and n are as defined hereinbefore . Referring to the above formula III , the halogen X may for example be chlorine, bromine or iodine. Of such compounds III , one III wherein X is iodine, i.e. an iodoethyl acylate, is preferably employed in the above esterification reaction. Since the compound III contains an asymmetric carbon atom, it can be submitted to the reaction after resolving it into the D and Isomers, thus, in the form of either the D isomer or the L isomer, or as an optional mixture of such isomers. The starting compound II for the present invention can be used in the contemplated reaction after converting it to its acid addition salt with an inorganic acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, etc. or an organic acid, e.g. oxalic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, etc. or its salt with a base such as alkali metals, e.g. sodium, potassium, etc, alkaline earth metals, e.g. calcium, magnesium, etc. or an organic amine, e.g. triethylamine, trimethylamine, pyridine, collidine, lutidine, etc. For the above mentioned esterification redaction, the starting compound III is used in a proportion of about 1 to 10 molar equivalents, preferably 1 to 1.5 molar equivalen to compound II or a salt thereof. This esterification reaction is generally conducted in a solvent inert to the reaction.As examples of said solvent may be mentioned amides such as N,N dimethylformamide hereinafter referred to as DMF , N,N dimethylacetamide hereinafter referred to as DMAC , hexamethylphosphorotriamide hereinafter referred to as HMPA etc., halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, chloroform, etc., sulfoxides such as dimethylsulfoxide hereinafter referred to asDMSO , sulfolane, etc., ethers such as dioxane, tetrahydrofuran hereinafter referred to as THF , etc,, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone etc., nitriles such as acetonitrile, etc., and anhydrous liquefied sulfur dioxide. Preferred species among these solvents are D.NT, DMAC, HMPA, acetone, acetonitrile, anhydrous liquefied sulfur dioxide. This esterification reaction is conducted generally at a temperature of 20 to 200C. A catalyst is not always needed.It may, however, be conducted in the presence of a catalyst such as a phase transfer catalyst, e.g. 18 crown 6. When anhydrous liquefied sulfur dioxide is used as the solvent, the reaction is desirably conducted at a temperature near the boiling point of the solvent, i.e. 10 to 200C. While the reaction time varies with different species of reactants and types of solvents, it is generally about 10 minutes to about 6 hours. The compound I or an acid addition salt thereof can also be produced by the following process, for instance. A compound of formula EMI7.1 wherein A is an amino group or an acylamino group other than 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl acetylamino is reacted with a compound of formula III in the same manner as the above mentioned esterification reaction. When A is an acylamino group, the resulting ester is further reacted with phosphorous pentachloride and, then, with an alcohol, e.g. methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropyl alcohol, n butanol, etc. cf. Journal of MedicinalChemistry 18, 992 1975 , and German Laid open PatentApplications Offenlegungsschriften Nos. 2460331 and 2460332 . The resulting compound, which can be represented by the formula EMI7.2 wherein the symbols have the same meanings as defined hereinbefore is acylated with the compound of the formula EMI7.3 which is 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl acetic acid. Referring to the above formula IV wherein A is an acylamino group, the acyl group may be any such group that is commonly used in the field of cephalosporin compounds. Preferred examples of the acylamino group include acetylamino, benzoylamino, phenylacetylamino, thienylacetylamino, phenyloxyacetylamino and 5 amino 5 carboxyvalerylamido. The amino group may optionally be protected with phthaloyl or the like.When A is an amino group or an amino substituted acylamino group, these amino groups are preferably protected.Protective groups that can be used for this protection include, among others, t butoxycarbonyl, carboxybenzyloxy, 2 hydroxy 1 naphthocarbonyl, trichloroethoxycarbonyl, 2 ethoxycarbonyl 1 methylvinyl and 2 methoxycarbonyl 1 methylvinyl. Deacylation of the ester compound produced by reacting compound To , wherein A is an acylamino group, with compound III is carried out in a per se known manner. Generally, about 2 to 5 molar equivalents of phosphorous pentachloride and about 10 to 40 molar equivalents of alcohol are used for each molar equivalent of the material ester compound. This reaction is generally conducted in an inert solvent such as halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, chloroform, etc.For the purpose of accelerating the reaction, there may be added a tertiary amine such as triethylamine, pyridine,N,N dimethylaniline, etc. The reaction is carried out within the temperature range of about 40 to 200C. A reaction time of 1 hour is generally sufficient. In reacting the resulting compound V with compound VI to produce compound I or an acid addition salt thereof, the amino group of compound VI is preferably protected. Protective groups may be the same as those mentioned for the protection of the amino group of compound IV . In conducting this acylation reaction, compound VI may be used in the form of a reactive derivative such as the corresponding acid halide, acid anhydride, mixed acid anhydride, active amide, activated ester, etc. Examples of said activated ester include pnitrophenyl ester, 2,4 dinitrophenyl ester, pentachlorophenyl ester, N hydroxyphthalimide ester, etc. The mixed acid anhydride mentioned above includes, for example, mixed acid anhydrides with carbonic acid monoesters such as carbonic acid monomethyl ester, carbonic acid monoisobutyl ester, etc. and mixed acid anhydrides with lower or 2 to 5 carbon atoms alkanoic acids which may optionally be substituted by halogen, such as pivalic acid, trichloroacetic acid, etc. When compound VI is used is the form of a free compound or a salt, a suitable condensing agent is employed.Examples of such condensing agent include dehydrating agents such as N,N disubstituted carbodiimides, e.g. N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, etc., azolides, e.g. N,N carbonylimidazole, N,N thienyldiimidazole, etc., N ethoxycarbonyl 2 ethoxy l ,2 dihydroquinoline, phosphorous oxychloride, alkoxyacetylene, e.g. ethoxyacetylene, etc., etc. It is considered that when such a condensing agent is employed, the reaction proceeds via formation of a reactive derivative at the carboxyl function. This reaction can generally be conducted in a solvent. As the solvent, there may be employed any of the common solvents, as well as a suitable mixture thereof, which does not interfere with the reaction, such as water, acetone, diisobutyl ketone, THF, ethyl acetate, dioxane, acetonitrile, chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethylene, pyridine, dimethylaniline, DMF, DMAC, DMSO, etc. The reaction temperature is virtually optional but the reaction is generally conducted under cooling or at room temperature. When the reaction proceeds with liberation of acid, a base is added to the reaction system as required. The base mentioned above is exemplified by aliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic nitrogen bases, alkali metal carbonates and alkali metal hydrogen carbonates, such as triethylamine, N,N dimethylaniline,N ethylmorpholine, pyridine, collidine, 2.6 lutidine, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, potassium hydrogen carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, etc. When the acylation reaction is predominantly a dehydrative reaction, water is preferably eliminated from the solvent.In some cases, the reaction may be carried out under anhydrous conditions in an inert gas such as nitrogen gas. When the reaction product has a protective group, the protective group is eliminated by a per se known procedure. Compound I or an acid addition salt thereof can also be produced by reacting compound V with a 4 halo 3 oxobutyryl halide, which can be obtained by reacting diketene with a halogen e.g. chlorine, bromine, iodine, in an equimolar ratio, to give a compound of formula VII EMI10.1 wherein m and n are as defined hereinbefore Y is a halogen atom, e.g. chlorine, bromine, iodine and reacting compound VII further with thiourea. In this reaction of compound VII with thiourea, the latter may be used either as such or in such other forms as salts with alkali metals such as lithium, sodium, potassium, etc., ammonium salts, etc. The reaction is generally conducted by admixing and reacting the two reactants in an equimolar ratio in a solvent and, if necessary, in the presence of 1 to 2 molar equivalents of a base.The solvent suitable for this reaction includes water, methanol, ethanol, acetone, dioxane, acetonitrile, chloroform, ethylene chloride, THF, ethyl acetate, DMF, DMAC, DMSO, etc. Among such solvents, hydrophilic solvents can be used in admixture with water.The base mentioned above includes, among others, alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, etc., alkali metal carbonates such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, etc., alkali metal hydrogen carbonates such as sodium hydrogen carbonate, and organic tertiary amines such as triethylamine, trimethylamine, pyridine, etc. There is virtually no limitation on the reaction temperature but generally the reaction is preferably conducted under cooling. The reaction proceeds fast and generally goes to completion within 10 minutes, although a reaction time of as long as 30 minutes or more may be required in some cases. The compound VII can be easily produced by the above process or per se known procedures. Furthermore, the compound I or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt is prepared by the following steps 1 A compound of the formula EMI11.1 wherein W is an acetoxy or an acetoacetoxy group , is allowed to react with a compound TIT under similar conditions of esterification to those described above, thereby to produce a compound of the formula IX belowEMI12.1 wherein m, n and W have the same meanings as defined hereinbefore , and 2 then the compound is allowed to react with 1 2 dimethylaminoethyl 5 mercapto 1H tetrazole In the reaction 2 , 1 2 dimethylaminoethyl 5 mercapto 1H tetrazole is used in a proportion of about 1 to 3 molar equivalents relative to compound IX . This reaction 2 can be usually carried out in a solvent inert to the reaction. Any conventional solvent such as water, THF, ethyl acetate, dioxane, acetonitrile, chloroform, dichloromethane, DMF, DMAC,DMSO and a mixture thereof can be used. In the case of water, another water missible solvent is recommended to admix. Presence of an inorganic base in the reaction system is preferable.Examples of the base are alkali metal carbonate e.g.sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, alkali metal bicarbonate e.g. sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, alkaline earth metal carbonate e.g. calcium carbonate and so on. Amount of the base present in the reaction is about 1 to 3 moles to a co reactant of the compound IX .The reaction temperature range is not particularly limited, but normally room temperature or about 150C to 600C, and the reaction time is roughly from 30 minutes to 3 hours, depending on kinds of solvents and temperature. Referring to the above reactions, when the objective compound I or an acid addition salt thereof includes the A2 isomer, the latter can be isomerized to the A3 isomer by a per se known procedure, for example the process described in Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 18, 986 1975 , or the entirety is first converted to the corresponding S oxide and the resulting A3 isomer is then reduced to the desired compound I or a salt thereof. When the objective compound I is produced in a free form, it can be converted to a desired acid addition salt thereof by dissolving the compound I in a free form in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane, chloroform or the like and adding about 1 to 10 molar equivalents of an acid. When compound I or an acid addition salt thereof is obtained as a racemic isomer, it can be resolved into optically active compounds Dand L isomers by a per se known procedure. The resulting compound I or an acid addition salt thereof can be isolated and purified by a per se known procedures such as solvent extraction, pH adjustment, phase transfer, crystallization, recrystallization, chromatography, etc. The starting compound III can be produced by a procedure known per se. Moreover, compound III can also be produced by the procedures schematically illustrated below.EMI14.1 In the above formulas, m and n are as defined hereinbefore. Referring to the formula III , the compound wherein X is iodine, i.e. an iodoethyl acylate, can be produced by reacting the acid chloride VIII with paraldehyde or acetaldehyde in the presence of a Lewis acid and reacting the resulting chloroethyl acylate with sodium iodide. The first step reaction is conducted in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst such as anhydrous zinc chloride, aluminum chloride, stannic chloride, etc. This reaction proceeds under cooling at about 40 to 300C, preferably at about 40 to OOC, or under heating at about 30 to 1400C, preferably at about 90 to 1400C. While the reaction time varies with the reaction temperature used, it is about 1 to 3 hours under cooling and about 1 to 6 hours under heating. The reaction proceeds satisfactorily even in the absence of a solvent. After completion of the first step reaction, the reaction mixture is subjected to distillation, column chromatography or the like to recover the chloroethyl acylate. This chloroethyl acylate is then reacted with sodium iodide to give the iodoethyl acylate the second step reaction . This second step reaction is conducted in the common solvent, e.g. acetone, acetonitrile, DMF,DMSO, etc. The reaction temperature may be as mild as room temperature to about 40 to 500C. The reaction time is about 15 minutes to 6 hours, preferably about 15 minutes to 2 hours. The reaction product can be isolated and purified, for example,by solvent extraction, pH adjustment, distillation, distillation under reduced pressure, phase transfer, chromatography, etc. The following reference examples, working examples and test example are further illustrative but by no means limitative of the present invention.
