# A forming fabric.

## Abstract
A forming fabric comprising an upper layer 1 which is intended to serve as the paper forming side and consists of thinner yarns 3, 4 , and a bottom layer 2 which consists of coarser yarns 5, 6 . The two layers 1, 2 are interconnected in that threads 7, 8 from the upper layer alternately pass down wardly to interweave with the bottom layer 2 and in the upper layer replace one another in such a manner that together these threads form the same weave pattern with the upper layer 1 as the rest of the yarns in that layer, which yarns do not interweave with the bottom layer.
