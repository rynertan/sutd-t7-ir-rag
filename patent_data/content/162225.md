# Fuzzy logic circuit.

## Abstract
A fuzzy logic circuit comprising a current mirror 1 com prising a FET, a first input current source 4 connected to the input side of the current mirror 1 , a second input current source 3 , a wired OR 7 connected at its input side to the output side of the current mirror 1 and to the second input current source 3 , and an output terminal 5 connected to the output side of the wired OR 7 .
