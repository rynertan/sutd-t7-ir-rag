# A carry bag.

## Abstract
A carry bag includes two wall sheets 34, 36 joined or coherent to define a bag portion, and the respective top portions of the wall sheets are provided with gripp ing and carrying openings. In order to provide a strong, easy to use, and relatively tight closing to the interior of the bag portion, the top portion of a first wall sheet 34 has been folded inwardly and attached to define an insertion pocket 24 , and a gripping opening is provided in the pocket. A top portion of the other wall sheet 36 is shaped as an insertion tongue 32 which is also provided with a gripping opening 6 and is adapted to be received in the interior of the pocket 24 so that the two gripping openings are at least partially coex tensive. In particular, if a carrying stick has been in serted in a passage 8 along the top edge of the in sertion tongue, there is provided a strong carrying means which also closes effectively to the interior of the bag portion, since the top edge of the tongue will be drawn against the bottom in the pocket, when car rying the bag.
