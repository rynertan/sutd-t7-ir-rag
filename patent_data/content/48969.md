# Apparatus for forming and planting slide fastener elements.

## Abstract
Disclosed herein is an apparatus for forming and planting fastener elements E comprising a ram 2 mounted on a frame 1 for reciprocal movement and having a cutting die 4 provided with a passage 4a for a wire W to be used for elements E and a forming die 5 for forming an engageable head C in an el ement E , a cutting punch 12 for cutting out an element E from the wire W , a forming punch 10 for forming the engageable head C in cooperation with the forming die 5 and at least one side punch 13 for planting the element E on a fastener tape S . The apparatus is characterized in that cam means 20, 21, 22 for driving the ram 2 , forming punch 10 and side punch 13 are formed on a common output drive shaft 19 and arranged so that the ram 2 dwells for a pre determined time at the end of each forward and back ward movement and the side punch 13 secures the el ement E to the tape S during the dwell of the ram 2 at the end of its forward movement and the forming punch 10 is actuated during the dwell of the ram at the end of its backward movement.
