# A structure for disposing of solid residue material from a combustion process in a furnace.

## Abstract
A structure 4,7 for impounding liquid is disclosed below the combustion chamber 1 of a steam generator. The struc ture divides the impounded liquid in two sections, or pools. The first section, or pool 2 , receives the hot residue gravi tated from the combustion chamber 1 and absorbs the thermal and mechanical shock of the residue. The second section, or pool 8 , is connected to the first pool 2 through a gate valve 6 and contains a continuous conveyor 13 which transports the cooled residue, received from the first pool, to a point of ultimate disposal.
