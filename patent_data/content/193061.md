# Viability test device.

## Abstract
A viability test device wherein the viability of a test composition for the determination of an analyte of interest can be determined by simply wetting the device with ordinary water. The viability device can be prepared in three formats a control or calibrator device, an internal control device and a self indicating device. Unreacted analyte, or an analog thereof, can be incorporated in a limited defined portion of a dried carrier matrix incorporated with a test composition to provide an internal control test device. When wetted with water, a positive optical response, usually color, indicates the test composition can provide a viable test for the analyte. The internal control test device is particularly advantageously used by diabetics in their own homes where a negative test response could be due to the desired control of the user s condition or due to deterioration of a test composition because of unfavourable storage conditions.
