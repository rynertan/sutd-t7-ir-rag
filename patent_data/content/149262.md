# Suspension for motor vehicles with elements having a different degree of elasticity.

## Abstract
Suspension, particularly for coupled axles 6, 8 of industrial vehicles, constituted by a first central elastic body 18 acted upon by two control arms 17, 19 carried by two elements 10, 12 rotatably coupled to a pin 7 of the chassis 5 of the vehicle, and by second lateral elastic bodies in the form of quarter elliptic springs 20, 22 supported by said elements 10, 12 in rotatable coupling on a pin 7 of the chassis 5 of the vehicle. The second lateral elastic bodies 20, 22 have a degree of elasticity lower than that of the central elastic body 18 so that the suspension in all loading conditions provides a certain degree of residual flexibility predetermined by de sign.
