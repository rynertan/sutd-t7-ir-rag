# Method and apparatus for manufacture of shaped pieces of mineral wool.

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus for manufacture of mould pieces of mineral wool which is bound by a binder and which has a substantially constant cross section along the entire length thereof, whereby mineral wool is manufactured in the form of flocks and or granules 24 and is impregnated or mixed with a binder and is collected in a feeding chamber 25 to which a forming channel 30 is connected, and the mineral wool is continously or stepwise pressed into and through the forming channel and during the movement in the forming channel is subjected to a heat treatment to cure the binder of the mineral wool, whereupon the continuous body of bound mineral wool is expelled from the forming chamber, if desired is subjected to a surface treatment or any subsequent treatment and is cut into intended lengths. The forming chamber may include one or more cores 40 providing one or more axial bores through the mineral wool body. A suction fan 26 may be provided adjacent the inlet end of the forming chamber, the suction side 32 of which is connected to the interior of the forming chamber to suck flocks and or granules of mineral wool into the forming chamber, whereas the blower side 29 thereof is connected to the feeding chamber to keep the flocks and granules of mineral wool fluidized. The mineral wool is compressed during the movement through the forming channel, and the feeding and compression may be accomplished by a reciprocatable piston 35 or a rotatable screw. The compressing degree is controlled by tongues 45 , the lower ends of which can be pressed radially inwards against the string of mineral wool 44 , thereby making the forming channel partially converging.
