DESCRIPTIVE MEMORYThe product obtained BIS THIO HETHYL NICOTINATE 1.10 DECANE is an original substance of synthesis pridedwth avery clear normalizing action in the altered lipidic methabolism of arte riosclerotic subjects.This compound has a therapeutical action, such to reduce the haematic rate of total lipids, of triglicerids and of cholesterol in cases of hyperlipidemy.The hesterification of nicotinic acid with Bis hydroxy 2 e thylthyo l,l0 decane increases and extends the terapeutical action, given by the single compounds, thanks to the slow release of nicotinic acid, which presents some collateral effects prurigo, hot flushes, when absorbed rapidly.Recently nicotinic acid has been discovered to present also profibrinolitic and hypolipidemic action.Profibrinolitic action seems to be connected with the capability of nicotinic acid of facilitating the release of an acti vator of plasminogen of vases endotheluine and or slackening the hepatic clearance of the plasminogen.Hypolipidemic activity follows the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in liver and of mobilization of NEFA from adipose tissue for antilipolite action, the plasmatic levels of NEFA decrease and the synthesis of triglicerids reduces.The reduction of NEFA might influence the aggregation of piastrine in fact it is well known the iperaggregating action of free fat acids, as well as pathogenic implications of augmen ted aggregation of piastrine in artheriosclerosis.The present product frees nicotinic acid and Bis hydroxy 2 ethyltio l,lO decane very slowly, increasing and extending the therapeutical activity.Pharmacological and clinical studies have shown the hypolipidemic activity of this new substance, its easy absorption, its affinity to plasmatic patients, its quick metabolization at patic level, through a procedure of oxidation and glucurono sulfoconiugation, by means of sulfonilic groups.The expulsion is above all through the renal emuntory and feces within 48 hrs. from assumption, avoiding any accumulation of the drug in the various organs.The therapeutical activity of the new substance reveals inhibition of LDL and VLDL both atherogen lypoproteins and leaves HDL antiatherogen lypoproteins unhaltered, and so it modifies positively the atherogenetic index IA VLDL LDL IA, with the advantage of reducing the chief HDL risk factor of arteriosclerotic pathology.Administrating the new mulecule, with equal doses of the single compounds above mentioned, we obtain a better respondence of the therapeutic margins, in respect to DL50, when administrated orally.Pharmacological proofs on mice showed a very good pharmacodinamic activity on lowering triglicerids, lipids and choleste rol, superior to 2.2 decamethyl dithio diethanol and to nicotinic acid and other compounds on sale.It was impossible to determine DL o in acute toxicity because any sympton of intolerability is not noticeable even at high doses.The new compound can be administered orally in its different forms tablets, capsules, etc. and by hypodermic injection, when necessary.The product is obtained Method A by reaction of nicotineilchloride hydrochloride with 1.10 bis hydroxyethyl thio deca ne in presence of an acceptor of hydrochloric acid, such as pyridine, triethilamine, N.N Dimethylaniline, etc. It can be also obtained according to method B by reaction of anhidride of nicotinic acid with l.lo bis hy droxyethyl thio decane U.S.P. 3,021,215 in presence of Pyridine. According to Method C the product was obtained by reaction of nicotinic acid chlorure with 2 Mercaptoethanol II and the product 2 Mercaptoethylnidotinate furtherly reacted with 1.10Dibromodecane in presence of sodium methyle or sodium hydroxide . We obtained the same product as in Method A and B, that is 2 Decamethylendithio 2 iethyl dinicotinate. 2 Mercaptoethylnicotinate III can react with 1,9 Decadiene Method D in presence of 360 Watt mercury lamp, 20 cm distant, for about 2 hrs.The following scheme shows the above mentioned Methods.
