# Loose piece electrical terminals selectively plated and apparatus and method therefor.

## Abstract
In the apparatus, loose piece terminals 15 are fed 114 to a rotating mandrel 3 , and are releasably secured by retaining means 132 . The mandrel 3 has a plurality of anode extentions 29 and associated nozzles 26 therein. Said anode extensions are mounted for reciprocation into receptacle portions 118 of secured terminals 15 . A conduit 36 supplies pressurised plating fluid through the nozzles 26 , to the anode extensions 29 and into the receptacle portions of the terminals to enable selective plating of internal surface portions. Retaining means 132 is an elongate resiliently mounted member surrounding a portion 126 of the mandrel 3 to hold terminals 15 against the mandrel 3 during the plating process. After plating the anode extension 29 are retracted from the terminals 15 , said terminals are thereafter released when they pass the end of retaining means 132 . A terminal so selectively plated has an internal plating of at least 3.81 10 ‚Å∑ meters with edge margins of tapered thickness covering at least portions of sheared edges of the terminal.
