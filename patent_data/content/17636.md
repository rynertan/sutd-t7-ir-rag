# A method and a device for synchronizing a digital memory with an existing TV system.

## Abstract
The aim of the present invention is to make it possible to synchronize a digital memory 8 with an existing TV system, in which a TV picture is transmitted with video interlace. According to the invention a corrected field synchronizing pulse B2 is formed by means of a composite sync signal S of the TV system, which pulse B2 , in spite of the video interlace, always appears at the starting point of a line and by means of which a part in an address counter 6 for the memory associated with vertical addressing of the memory is reset to a starting position at the starting point of each picture field. The address counter is stepped for addressing purposes by means of a clock signal from a main oscillator 5 , the frequency of which is controlled in response to a comparison between a line synchronizing signal L1 derived from the composite sync signal and line frequency signals L2, L3 supplied from the address counter.
