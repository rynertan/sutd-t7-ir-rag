# Transmission mechanism with parallel transmission system including one way clutches, one being lockable.

## Abstract
A power supplying member supplies rotational power in a certain rotational direction to a first member of the transmission, and a power receiving member takes out power from a second member. Several power transmission systems are provided between the first and the second member, which are selectively engagable so as to provide various speed stages between them. Each power transmis sion system has a clutching mechanism which either can be disconnected so as to freewheel in both rotational directions, or can be connected only in the one rotational direction which is required for transmission of power through that power transmission system, so as to function as a one way clutch. Thus shifting between the speed stages does not require delicate controlling of the clutching mechanisms. At least one of these clutching mechanisms can also be locked up so as to transmit rotational power in both rotational directions, and this enables engine braking to be made available, when the transmission is mounted in an automo tive vehicle.
