# Hollow waveguides having disparate dielectric overcoatings.

## Abstract
A hollow waveguide has a rectangular or square internal cross section, with all internal surfaces 100, 101, 200, 201 coated with a reflecting metal such as silver. One pair of oppos ing surfaces 100, 101 is dielectric overcoated of a thickness less than half the quarter wave thickness, while the other pair of opposing surfaces 200, 201 has thickness which is an in tegral multiple of the quarter wave thickness. ThFâ‚„, ZnSe, and Ge are suitable materials.
