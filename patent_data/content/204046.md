# Process and catalyst for the conversion of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone.

## Abstract
A catalyst and a process to convert commercial cyclohexa nol feed to cyclohexanone at a relatively low temperature at stable conversion levels for long periods of operation. This process and catalyst allow operation in the presence of water and high boiling side products. The process features high conversion efficiency and low by product formation, by use of an improved CuO ZnO catalyst promoted with an alkali metal compound such as sodium carbonate. The catalyst is stable in the presence of water and heavy end products in the feedstock up to 13 . The presence of water rejuvenates the catalyst, increases the conversion and decreases the phenol content in the product mixture.

## Claims
1. A low temperature process for the catalytic dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone characterised in that the process comprises contacting a cyclohexanol containing feedstream with a catalyst containing copper oxide and zinc oxide promoted with an effective amount of an alkali metal compound, and recovering an effluent containing cyclohexanone.

## Description
A catalytic process, including a new catalyst, for the catalytic dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone. Industrially, cyclohexanol is converted to cyclohexanone in the presence of a copper catalyst at temperatures of 220 to 260 C or 350 to 450 C. The low temperature conversion, in the prior art results in low throughput, and the catalyst may be sub ject to deactivation by the water produced as a by product of the reaction. The hydrolysis of the catalyst by the water vapor may also fracture the catalyst and build up the pressure drop. A high temperature conversion catalyst enables nearly complete conversion of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone however, this often causes unde sired production of phenol and cyclohexene, resulting in an effi ciency loss. Copper oxide zinc oxide catalysts have been reported in several literature and patent references, namely, A. Sputa et al, Czechoslovakia Patent 151,166, Dec. 15, 1973 CA As mentioned above, the known types of copper oxide zinc oxide catalysts often bring about the formation of undesirable cyclohexene and phenol. Accordingly, some of these were promoted with calcium, barium ruthenium metals to modify the catalytic properties. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved process for the catalytic dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone. Another object is to provide an improved catalyst for the conversion of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone. A further object is to provide an improved low temperature catalytic conversion process for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone, in which the conversion is improved and by product formation is inhibited. An additional object is to provide such a process and catalyst in which the conversion is improved, by use of an improved catalyst which is stable and resistant in the presence of water and heavy end products in the feedstock up to 13 . Still another object is to provide such a process in which the CuO ZnO catalytic agent is promoted by an alkali metal compound such as sodium carbonate, bicarbonate or carboxylate. Still a further object is to provide an improved catalyst for and a process which is compatible with water. These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become evident from the following description. It has been discovered that a catalyst composed of copper oxide and zinc oxide promoted with an alkali metal compound such as sodium carbonate is capable of producing high conversions of cyclo hexanol to cyclohexanone at a relatively low reaction temperature, without a large increase of phenol by product and aldol condensa tion products. The catalyst is not only stable thermally during the operation, but is also resistant to the poisonous effect of large amounts of water and high boiling products which are present in industrial cyclohexanol feedstock. Furthermore, two beneficial effects of water have been found by using the subject catalyst in a large scale pilot plant test for converting cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone. Firstly, the incorporation of the proper amount of water unexpectedly increases the conversion and decreases the phenol content in the reaction product. Secondly, an increase of catalyst activity is observed by the addition of a large amount of water for a short period, and this increase of activity was kept unchanged even after the water concentration decreased to the normal level. This rejuvenation effect of water occurred repeatedly in plant tests to maintain a constant level of conversion without the need to significantly increase the reaction temperature. The product cyclohexanone is used, The copper oxide zinc oxide catalyst is promoted with a small but effective amount of alkali metal compound. The alkali metal compound will generally be present in the range of about 0.05 to 16 wt , preferably 0.1 to 5.0 wt . The alkali metal compound is typically a salt such as sodium carbonate, bicarbonate or alkali metal salt of an organic acid, e.g., acetate, citrates, naphthanate or octoate, which decomposes to the oxide slowly upon heating. The alkali metal may be sodium, potassium, lithium, cesium or rubidium. With the catalyst of the invention the presence of water has a salutary effect. Generally, the feedstream may contain up to about 10 wt of water, and up to about 14 wt of regular industrial side products. Typically, the catalyst, when partially deactivated, is rejuvenated by the incorporation of water in the process environ ment. The conversion usually takes place in a tube and shell reactor, at an elevated temperature in the range of about 200 C to 320 C, preferably 220 C to 260 C. The space velocity in the reactor is generally in the range of about 0.1 to 3.0, preferably, from 0.5 to 1.5. Following are Examples which illustrate various aspects of the invention, as well as comparative Examples showing the advantages of the present catalyst. Zinc nitrate trihydrate 244 g and copper nitrate trihydrate 483 g are dissolved in distilled water 1500 ml at 25 C. The solution is rapidly agitated while 10 ammonium bicar bonate solution 3800 ml is added over a period of 30 minutes at 25 C. Agitation is continued for 30 minutes. The slurry is filtered, washed with distilled water 1500 ml , and the filter cake dried at 110 C for 4 hours. After drying, the cake is calcined at 400 C for 2 hours. After cooling, sodium carbonate 0.76 g is added to the calcined product with sufficient distilled water to produce a paste. The paste is dried and shaped into tablets 6 mm 0.D. 3 mm H . The BET surface area is found to be 40 m² g. Typically, the catalyst is initially reduced with hydrogen and has a BET surface area of about 42 m² g, a pore volume of 0.23 cc g, a bulk density of 1.15 g cc, and a side crush strength dead weight load of 7.3 kg minimum, 6 kg when in a fresh condition, and 8.3 kg minimum, 4 kg after 180 days on stream.
