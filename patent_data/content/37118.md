# A process for manufacturing a bulky flat yarn.

## Abstract
A process for manufacturing a bulky flat yarn compris ing preparing at least two kinds of thermoplastic synthetic undrawn yarns 1, 2 having different natural draw ratios, respectively simultaneously drawing said prepared yarns at a draw ratio which is equal to or larger than the smallest natural draw ratio of the yarns and which is equal to or smaller than the largest natural draw ratio and releasing drawing tension in the yarns after they are drawn. The yarns are mixed by means of an interlacing air nozzle 3 before or after they are drawn.
