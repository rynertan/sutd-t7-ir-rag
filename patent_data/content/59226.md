The invention relates to methods for treating graminaceous crops, leguminous crops, cotton, sunflowers and herbaceous ornamental plants to increase axillary branching, improve the canopy and enhance flowering there or. Surprisingly, application of the above said salts to the foliage of the above identified crops has the further advantage that said salts produce a dwarfing effect in said plants while increasing the stem stiffness thereof.They also enhance yield therefrom. Dwarfing andior stiffening of the stems of cotton, legumes, graminaceous crops and sunflowers is most advantageous to the farmer aince lodging of these crops usually results in reduced yields of the effected crops. Lodging, in the present application, refers to the deflection of the plant from the vertical, varying in degree from only a slight deflection to complete deflection i.e. plants prone caused by, in most cases, the action of wind and or rain on the plants. This deflection is such that when the causal agent wind, rain is no longer present the deflection is neither immediately nor completely overcome. Moreover, where extensive or severe lodging has occurred, the crop may be difficult to harvest and the yield markedly teduced. In practice we have found that application to the foliage of seedling plants of from about 0.06 to 2.0 kg ha and preferably about 0.12S to 0.50 kglha is sufficient to achieve the several desirable and advantageous biological responses in plants described above. Inasmuch as the salts or compounds of formula I of the present invention have only limited solubility in water, they are generally formulated for foliar application as wettable powders flowable dispersions or emulsion concentrates, which are usually dispersed in water or in other, inexpensive, liquid diluents for application to the foliage of said plants as a liquid spray. A typical wettable powder can be prepared by grinding together approximately 46X by weight of a finely divided carrier such as attapulgite, 50 by weight of the pyrazolium, pyra olinium or pyrazolidine salt of 2,4,6 trisubstituted N nitroaniline, 32 by weigh of the sodium salt of condensed naphthalene sulfonic acids and 1 by weight of sodium N methyl N oleoyltaurate. A A typical lovable dispersion can be prepared by admixing about 42t by weight of the N nitroaniline salt with about 3X by weight of the sodium salt of condensed naphthalene sulfonic acids, 2 by weight of finely divided bentonite and 53 by weight of water 5 Emulsion concentrates may be prepared by dissolving 15 to 70 by weight of the formula I compound in 85 to 30Z of a solvent such as N methylpyrrolidone, lower alcohols, methylisobutylketone, 2 methoxy ethanol, propylene glycol diethylene glycol, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, formamide, methylformamide, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Advantage ously, surfactants such as polyoxyethylated vegetable oil or an alkyl phenoxy polyoxyethylene ethanol are also incorporated in amounts of 1 to 5Z by weight of said concentrate. In accordance vith this invention, the substituted N nitroanilines phenylnitramines can be prepared from the corrcsponding substituted anilines by a variety of conventional procedures. For illustrative purposes, one such procedure is hereinbelow graphically illustrated and described as follows EMI32.1 wherein R2, 14 and R6 are as defined above. The above synthesis is conveniently carried out in a solvent, such as acetic acid, preferably in the presence of acetic anhydride. The product may be precipitated from the reaction mixture by the addition of ice water. Purification nay be effected by conyentional procedures such as recrystallization, chromatography, and the like. The nitroanilines, wherein R2 andior R6 are haloalkyl or hydroxyalkyl and R4 is halogen, can be prepared by o txo step synthesis involving Step 1, the reastion of the appropriate haloalkyl aniline or haloalkoxyaniline with halogen e.g.chlorine or bromine in the presence of an acid acceptor such as sodium acetate, potassium acetate, or the like, in the presence of an inert organic solvent e.g. tert butanol, CC14, ethylene dichlorlde, chlorobenzene, or the like . The reaction is generally conducted at a temperature in the range of from 25 C to 75 C, and preferably at a temperature of about 45 C to 55 C. The reaction yields the corresponding 2,4,6 trisubstituted aniline, which may then be converted, in Step 2, to the corresponding 2,4,6 trisubstituted N nitroaniline by reaction with nitric acid in the presence of a solvent, such as acetic acid, and acetic anhydride.Steps 1 and 2 can be graphically illustrated as follows Step 1EMI33.1 wherein h and R6 are haloalkyl or haloalkory, and R4 is chlorine or bromine. Step 2EMI34.1 The formula II salts of the substituted N nitroaniline compounds can be conveniently prepared from the substituted nitroaniline compounds by one or more procedures, hereinafter referred to as Methods A,B,C,D or E. Methods for the preparation of salts of substituted N nitroanilines Method A The N nitroaniline is dissolved in dilute aqueous sodium or potassium hydroxide and filtered. To this solution is added one solar equivalent of the appropriate salt and dissolved in water. In most cases the product separates as a solid, and is removed by filtration and purified by recrystallization. Whenever no precipitation occurs or the product separates as an oil, an extraction with methylene chloride is performed. Concentration of this extract yields the product which may be further purified by recrystallization. Method B A solution of the N nitroaniline in anhydrous ether is treated with a solution of one equivalent of the appropriate nitrogen base in cther. The desired product is removed by filtration and purified by washing and recrystallization. Precipitation of the product may be promoted by the addition of petroleum ether.Method C To a methanolic suspension of the silver salt of theN nitroaniline is added one cquivalent of the halide salt of the appropriate amine dissolved in methanol. The mixture is stirred at 250C for one hour. The precipitated silver halide is removed by filtration, the product is recovered by evaporating the methanolic solution and purified by recrystallization.Method D An aqueous solution of the sodium salt of the Nnitroaniline is saturated with a large excess of the desired metal salt until solids remain undissolved. After stirring for one hour, the solids are removed by filtration and recrystallized or washed with a suitable solvent,. and dried.Method E A methylene chloride solution of the free N nitroaniline is treated with a three fold excess of an aqueous solution of the appropriate metal hydroxide, acetate or carbonate. If precipitation occurs, the product is removed by filtration and recrystallized. Otherwise, the aqueous layer is separated and evaporated to dryness.The residue is treated with ethyl acetate and filtered. Removal of the ethyl acetate affords the product which may be recrystallized, if necessary. Formula I compounds wherein R7 is a substituent other than hydrogen may be conveniently prepared as follows The appropriately substituted formula I compound hydrogen is reacted in with an alcoholic solution of 1 equivalent of sodium hydroxide in the presence of a lower alcohol such as methanol, and the thus formed sodium salt is isolated by evaporating the reaction mixture to dryness. Next, the sodium salts dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO and treated with the appropriate alkyl halide at a temperature range from about 200C to about 300C, preferably 250C for a period of time sufficient to essentially complete the reaction.The reaction mixture is then poured into water, the product extracted with a water immiscible solvent such U ether and recovered from said extract by standard laboratory procedures. The above reaction sequence may be graphically illustrated as follows EMI36.1 Wherein in the above reaction sequence Q is halogen, n, R, to are as hereinabove defined except that in the R7 Q formula cannot be hydrogen. Formula Ia phenylnitramines may be prepared by the following route A formula II silver salt is suspended in ether under an inert atmosphere such as N2, and reacted with 1.1 equivalent of the appropriate 17 Q compound at a temperature range of from about 20 C to about 30 C and preferably 25 0C for a period of time sufficient to essentially complete the reaction. The thus obtained 0 alkyl derivative of formula Ia structure is isolated and purified by standard laboratory procedures.The above reaction sequence may be graphically illustrated as follows EMI37.1 It is recognized of course, that in the course of the preparation of formula I compounds wherein 17 is other than hydrogen formula compounds are also formed, and vice versa. Formula I compounds wherein n is 1 and F7 is hydrogen may be conveniently prepared as follows A solution of the appropriate benzyl halide or mesylate and ammonium nitrourethane is heated in the presence of dry dimethyl sulfoxide at about 80 C for about 4 hours or a period of time sufficient to essentially complete the reaction. The reaction mixture is then cooled drown, poured in water extracted with a water immiscible organic solvent such as ether and the solution dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Next, anhydrous ammonia gas is bubbled through the solution. The precipitated material is then isolated, dissolved in water and precipitated from the aqueous solution with a dilute acid.The thus obtained product is then isolated by standard laboratory methods and further purified, if so desired. The above rcaction sequence may be graphically illustrated as follows EMI38.1 Wherein R1 to R6 are as hereinabove defined, T is Zr, Cl orCH3SO3. The intermediate substituted anilines may also beN nitrated to yield the corresponding N nitroanilines as follows Diisopropylamines is llthiated with an equimolar amount of n butyllichium in an inert solvent such as ether at about 75 to 80 C. Next a solution of the appropriately substituted aniline is added to the above mixture at about 600C, the reaction aixture warmed to about OOC and methyl nitrate added. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm slowly to room temperature and the product product isolated by standard laboratory procedures. Surprisingly, it has also been found that the formula I compounds of this invention are effective for reducing the relative stem growth of broadleaf plants and for increasing the stem stiffness thereof, particularly for broadleaf agronomic crops such as aunflowers, when said compounds are applied preemergence to soil in which seeds of said plants have been sown. When used in this manner said formula I compounds are generally applied at rates of from 0.125 to 2.0 and preferably 0.25 to 0.75 kg ha. The invention is further illustrated by the Examples set forth below EXAMPLE 1Methods for the preparation of salts of 2.4s6 trisubstituted N nitroanilines Method A The N nitroaniline is dissolved in dilute aqueous sodium or potassium hydroxide and filtered.

When cver no precipitation occurs or the product separates as an oil, an extraction with methylene chloride is performed. Concentration of this extract yields the product which may be further purified by recrystallization. Method B A solution of the N nitroaniline in anhydrous ether is treated with a solution of one equivalent of the appropriate nitrogen base in ether. The desired product is removed by filtration and purified by washing and recrystallization.Precipitation of the product may be promoted by the addition of petroleum ether. method C To a nethanolic suspension of the silver salt of theN nitroaniline is added one equivalent of the halide salt of the appropriate amine dissolved in methanol.

The same spraying apparatus, described in Example 7 above, is used and after spraying the plants are placed on greenhouse benches and watered and fertilized.Three weeks after treatment the plants are examined to determine what effect the application of test compound has had on the axillary branching and canopy development of the treated plants. Increased axillary branching and improved canopy are biological responses which are highly advantageous in the growing of ornamental plants. These responses also have advantage in many crops since increased branching may result in the greater production of fruit, while improved canopy tends to shade and suppress the growth of undesirable weeds that compete with the crops for sunlight, water and plant nutrients. Data obtained are reported in table VII below where axillary branching and canopy are reported as percent increase over untreated controls.

Adelphia as the plant species In the following tests seedling soybean plants growing in plastic cups are sprayed with aqueous acetone solutions or dispersions of test compounds when the naj P. reached the 2nd to 3rd trifoliate stage. Test solutions or dispersions are prepared with 0.25 v v Colloidal DIOFtL. surfactant and sufficient test compound to provide the plants with 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 or 0.06 kg ha of said compound when the test solutions are sprayed on said plants from an overhead sprayer delivering 747 1 ha of solution. After spraying the plants are placed on green house benches and watered and fertilized. Three weeks after spraying the plants are examined and the amount of flowering determined for all plants. Data obtained are reported in the taple below as percent increase in flowering over untreated controls. From the data reported in Table VIII below it can be seen that the compounds of the present invention applied at rates of from 0.06 to 0.25 kg ha enhance flow ering of treated plant more than 10 over untreated controls. This response is particularly desirable for treatment of flowering varieties of ornamental plants as well as agronomic crops.
