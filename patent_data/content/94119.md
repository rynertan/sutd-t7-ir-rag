# Stable liquid detergent compositions.

## Abstract
Stable liquid detergent compositions containing amine oxide and alcohol polyethoxylate sulfate surfactants, a wa ter soluble detergency builder, an alkanolamine and a hy drotrope are disclosed. The compositions recover, after freezing, to single phase isotropic liquids at relatively low temperatures.
