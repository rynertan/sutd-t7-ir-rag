# Preparation of sequential polymers and use thereof in coating compositions and as thickening agents.

## Abstract
Water insoluble polymer is prepared by sequential emulsion polymerization in which an acid polymer core is at least partially encased in a sheath polymer. The sheath is permeable to volatile base, such as ammonia, to permit swelling of the core upon at least partial neutralization. The polymer may be used in aqueous coating compositions such as paints to serve as all or part of the binder. The swollen polymer may thicken aqueous media and upon drying may form microvoids in the particles thereof to act as an opacifier which may supplement or replace part or all of the pigmentary material or extender in coating composi tions.
