# Method and apparatus for uniform induction heating of an elongated workpiece.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for uniformly heating a work piece such as a sucker rod A or the like having a uniform cross section over a major portion of its length and an enlargement adjacent each end thereof. A multi turn induc tor 20 is coaxially disposed around a portion of an elongated workpath with the rod A being longitudinally moved at some preselected rate of travel along the workpath toward the inductor entrance end 22 . The inductor 20 is normally at a first level of energization adapted to inductively heat the rod major portion to some predetermined tempera ture as it passes through the inductor 20 . Sensing a preselected power absorption level by the rod A as the enlargement adjacent the leading and is inductively coupled with the inductor 20 causes the inductor 20 to be automatically placed at a second, higher level of energization for heating the enlargement to the predetermined tempera ture. The inductor 20 then automatically returns to the normal level of energization after some predetermined time interval for inductively heating the rod major portion. As the enlargement adjacent the rod trailing end is placed in an inductively coupled relationship with the inductor 20 , the predetermined power absorption level increase is again sensed and the inductor 20 is automatically switched to the higher level of energization. The inductor energization levels and the power absorption level sensing capabilities are adjustable to accommodate different rod and feed character istics.
