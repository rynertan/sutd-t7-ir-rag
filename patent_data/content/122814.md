More preferably, the mouse cells are also cotransformed with a DNA sequence encoding the In chain of that antigen. These mouse cells are useful in producing those antigens and in forming hybridomas that are characterized by monoclonal antibodies recognizing allospecific determinants of those antigens. These antibodies are useful in typing and therapeutic processes and compositions.

## Description
A METHOD OF COTRANSFORMATION, COTRANSFORMED MOUSE CELLS PRODUCING AT THEIR SURFACE HUMAN CLASS II ANTIGENS AND THE USE OF THOSE CELLS TO GENERATE MOUSE KYBRIDOMAS THAT PRODUCE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES TO THOSE ANTIGENS TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a method of cotransformation and mouse cells lines engineered by that method to produce at their surface human Class II antigens of the Major Histocompatibility Complex More specifically, it relates to processes used to produce cotransformed mouse cells that produce at their surface human Class II antigens and the cotransformed mouse cells themselves. These mouse cells are useful in producing hybridomas that make monoclonal antibodies that recognize allospecific Class II determinants.Such specific monoclonal antibodies are employed in typing individuals for tissue transplantation and for determining their susceptibility to certain diseases and also as therapeutic agents. BACKGROUND ART The human lymphocyte antigen HLA system is the Major Histocompatibility Complex in man. It, therefore, constitutes the strongest barrier for tissue and organ transplants between individuals, apparently distinguishing between self and non self. In addition, HLA factors have been demonstrated to be associated with increased susceptibility to a wide variety of diseases.Therefore, the antigens of the BLA system and their anti bodies have found use in diagnostic typing processes and products for determining an individual s susceptibility to a wide variety of diseases and his characteristics as a donor or acceptor of a tissue or organ transplant F. H. Bach and J. J. Van Rood, N. Engi. J. Med., 295, pp. 806 13 1976 3. From a genetic point of view the HLA system is fairly well characterized. See e.g., L. P. Ryder et al., 1Genetics Of BLA Disease Association , Ann. Rev. Genet., 15, pp. 169 87 1981 J. L. Strominger et al., in TheRole of the Major Bistocompatibility Complex in Immunobiology, M.Dorf, ed., Garland SPZM Press, pp. 115 172 1981 T. Sasazuki et al., The Association Between GenesIn The Major Histocompatibility Complex And Disease Susceptibility , Ann. Rev. Med., 28, pp. 425 52 1977 . See also Structure And Function Of HLA DR , ImmunologicalReviews, 66 1982 .It consists of a series of more or less highly polymorphic loci situated within an interval of about 2 centimorgan CM on the short arm of chromosome 6. Three loci in that system HLA A, B and C encode one class of codominantly expressed alloantigens Class I .Another locus BLA D encodes a second class of codominant alloantigens with a high degree of recognized polymorphism Class II . Three other loci, controlling some of the initial components C2, C4 and factor Bf of the complement cascade, also belong to the HLA system Class III . Finally, there is an non specific region in the ELA complex designated Ia. Region Ia appears related to, but different than, the DR locus. The biology of the HLA system is less well understood. Class I antigens are distributed in all tissues except erythrocytes. Class II antigens are highly polymorphic and are substantially restricted to p lymphocytes and mononuclear phagocytic cells. The Class III complement factors are directly involved in the activation of the C3 factor, the key component in the complement system.The Class II antigens appear to be involved in immunological phenomena immune responsiveness, T cell sup press ion, T cell and ss cell cooperation and T cell and macrophage presentation B. Benacerraf in The Role OfThe Major Histocompatibility Complex In Immunobiology ,M. E. Dorf, ed., Garland SPTM Press, pp. 255 69 1981 . The human Class II antigens are composed of two transmembrane, non covalently linked glycosylated peptide chains, a heavy or a chain of about 35000 molecular weight and a light or chain of about 29000 molecular weight, that span the cellular membrane Strominger et al., supra and Ryder et al., supra . Intracellularly, a third peptide chain, the invariant chain In , of about 32000 molecular weight is associated with the a and chains D. J. Charron and H. O. McDevitt, J. Exp. Med., 152, pp. 185 365 1980 Strominger, supra . It appears that the light or chain carries the polymorphism of the Class II antigens, while the a chain and third chain appear identical in different individuals G. Corte et al., Proc. Natal. Acad. Sci.USA, 78, pp. 534 38 1981 Charron and McDevitt, sutra . It is believed that the In chain is involved in the assembly and transport cf their cr Class II antigens M.S. Oen et al., J. Biol. Chem., 256, pp. 8987 93 1981 S. Kuist et al., Cell, 29, pp. 61 69 1982 . At least three ais tinct types of Class II antigens have been identified HLA DR antigens F.H. ach and J.J. van Rood, N. ngl. J. Med., 295, pp. 806 13 1976 W.R. Bodmer et al., inHistocompatibility Testing eds. W. Bodman et al. ,Munksggard, Copenhagen, Denmark 1978 R.J. Winchester and H.E. Kunkel, Adv. Immunol., 28, pp. 221 298 1980 J.L. Strominger et al., in The Role Of The Major Histocompatibility Complex In Immunobiolocy, ed. M.E. Dorf ,Garland, New York, New York, 1981 , the DC antigens R. Tosi et al. , Exp. Med., 148, pp. 1592 1611 1978 , and the SB antigens S. Shaw et al., J. Exp. Med., 152, pp. 565 80 1980 . See Figure 1. These antigens are characterized by serological and cellular alloreactivity, with the HLA DR antigens displaying the most extensive polymorphism. Among the HLA DR antigens a number of serologically distinct HLA DR antigens have been identified HLA DRl through HLA DR8 and monoclonal antibodies have defined subparts of DR antigens within homozygous cell lines V. Quaranta et al., J. Immunol., 125, pp. 1421 25 1980 S. Carrel et al., Mol. Immunol., 18, pp. 403 11 1981 J. Two DR p chains can also be distinguished in several homozygous cell lines by peptide analysis R. S.Accolla et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 78, pp. 4549 51 1981 . Several other loci also exist that encode polymorphic Ia like antigens that are closely linked but not identical, to HLA DR G. Corte et al. Nature, 292, pp. 357 60 1981 Nadler et al., Nature, 290, pp. 591 93 1981 . We have also established that at least three different loci exist for ELA DR or DR like ss chains J Gorski et al., in press E.O. Long et al., Hum. Immunol., in press . Therefore the ELA DR subregion of the HLA D region is itself genetically complex. At present HLA DR antigens are isolated serologically by precipitation with antisera. Therefore, the exact nature of the HLA DR determinants is uncertain.However, these antigens have found use in typing processes and products to determine the compatibility of donors and acceptors for tissue or organ transplants and to determine susceptibility of an individual to a wide variety of diseases. For example, Ryder et al., supra, has reported the following disease susceptibilities based on DR1 through DRS typing D Positive Frequency Relative EthiologicalDisease Typing Patients Controls Risk Fraction Dermatitis herpetiformis D DR3 85 26.3 15.4 0.80Coeliac disease D DR3 79 26.3 10.8 0.72 D DR7 also increasedSicca syndrome D DR3 78 26.3 9.7 0.70Idiopathic Addison s disease D DR3 69 26.3 6.3 0.58Graves disease D DR3 56 26.3 3.7 0.42Insulin dependent diabetes D DR3 56 28.2 3.3 0.39 D DR4 75 32.2 6.4 0.63 D DR2 10 30.5 0.2 Myasthenia gravis D DR3 50 28.2 2.5 0.30 B8 47 24.6 2.7 0.30SLE D DPB .70 28.2 5.8 0.58Idiopathic membraneous nephropathy D DR3 75 20.0 12.0 0.69Multiple sclerosis D DR2 59 25.8 4.1 0.45Optic neuritis D DR2 46 25.8 2.4 0.27Goodpasture s syndrome D DR2 88 32.0 15.9 RTI ID 5.8 0.82 Rheumatoid arthritis D DR4 50 19.4 4.2 0.38 Pemphigus D DR4 87 32.1 14.4 0.81IgA nephropathy D DR4 49 19.5 4.0 0.37Hydralazine induced SLE D DR4 73 32.7 5.6 0.60 Hashimoto s thryoiditis D DR5 19 6.9 3.2 0.13Pernicious anemia D DRS 25 5.8 5.4 0.20Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis pauciart D DRS 50 16.2 5.2 0.40From these typings, it can be seen that an individual typed positive for D DR4 has a 6.4 times higher risk of developing insulin dependent diabetes than individuals typed negative for D DR4. See also HLA DR And Diseases1 , Immunolovical Reviews, 70 183 J. D. Stobo et al., J.Lab.Clin.Med., 100, pp. 822 28 1982 J. T.Rosenbaum et al., J.Exp.Med., 15, pp. 1694 et seq. 1981 P. Steinmark et al., Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA, 78, pp. 7111 et seq. 1981 . In some cases it has also been demonstrated that a disease is more severe in patients having the diseaseassociated antigen than in those who do not have that antigen.For example, multiple sclerosis progresses more rapidly in D DR2 positive patients than in D DR2 negative patientsMoreover, relapses in certain diseases are more common in patients positive for the disease associated antigens. Plainly, then, HLA DR typing has great diagnostic and prognostic value. However, the use of such typing processes and products and, therefore, the attainment of the important advantages that they would provide in identifying acceptable transplant donors and recipients and disease susceptible individuals, has been severely restricted because the present typing procedure is not able to distinguish well among various class II specificities because the monoclonal antibodies available to date are not specific and distinct enough. Moreover antibodies against each individual lILA DR, DC and SB antigen are not available. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION This invention generally solves the problems referred to above by providing a process of cotransformation and the use of that process to cotransform mouse cells so that those cells express at their surface particular human class II antigens. The invention also provides these mouse cells carrying at their surface human class II antigens. Because this surface antigen is the only non mouse antigen produced by the mouse cell, it will elicit a specific immune response in mice of the same genetic type and thereby allow the preparation hybridomas that produce monoclonal antibodies specific to the particular human class II antigen produced by the mouse cell. By virtue of our invention, it is now possible to prepare mouse cells that express a particular human class II antigen in a stable manner at the cell surface.Moreover, as a result of this invention, mouse mouse hybridomas may be formed that produce monoclonal antibodies recognizing allospecific class IT determinants expressed by the mouse cells of this invention. Finally, this invention provides such allospecific monoclonal antibodies for use in typing individuals for tissue transplants and for their susceptibility to certain diseases and for use as therapeutic agents against various diseases in which a class II antigen linked immune reactivity may be involved in the pathological process. These and the other objects of this invention are effected by a general method of cotransformation where the products of the DNA sequences used in the cotransformation interact subsequently to their production. In accordance with this invention, this method in one preferred embodiment results in mouse cells cotransformed with DNA sequences encoding the a, ss, and perhaps the invariant chain, of human class II antigens that produce the desired human class II antigens on their surface.Such mouse cells may then be employed to produce mousemouse hybridomas that produce monoclonal antibodies recognizing allospecific class II determinants. The contransformation process of this invention comprises the steps of cotransforming appropriate cells with at least two DNA sequences, said sequences encoding protein products that interact with each other after synthesis in the host cell. In one preferred embodiment of this invention, that process is employed to produce mouse cells carrying at their surface a human class II antigen. The process for producing those mouse cells comprises the step of cotransforming appropriate mouse cells with a a DNA sequence encoding the a chain of a human class II antigen, b a DNA sequence encoding the chain of that human class II antigen, c a DNA sequence encoding a selectable marker, and preferably, but not necessarily, d a DNA sequence encoding The invariant chain of That human class II antigen. These cells may then be cultured to express those DNA sequences, to assemble intracellularly the protein products of them correctly and to transmit the resulting protein complex to the cell surface with the correct antigenic specificity. The resulting mouse cells carrying that antigen at their surface may then be employed to produce hybridomas that produce monoclonal antibodies recognizing allospecific determinants of the class II antigen for use in tying processes and therapy.

Figure 2 is a partial restriction map of DNA sequence A DR ss 10 used in one embodiment of this invention. BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION In order that the invention described herein may be more fully understood, the following detailed description is set forth. In the description the following terms are em ployed Recombinant DNA Molecule A molecule consisting of segments of DNA from different genomes. Polypeptide A linear array of amino acids connected one to the other by peptide bonds between the a amino and carboxy groups of adjacent amino acids. Expression The process undergone by a DNA fragment or gene to produce a polypeptide It is a combination of transcription the process of producing mRMA from a DNA fragment and translation the process of producing a polypeptide from mRNA . Plasmid A non chromosomal double strandedDNA sequence comprising an intact Xreplicon such that the plasmid is replicated in a host cell. When the plasmid is placed within a unicellular organism, the characteristics of that DNA of the plasmid modifies or transforms the characteristics of the host organism. For example, a plasmid carrying the gene for tetracycline R resistance text transforms a cell previously sensitive to tetracycline into one which is resistant to it A cell transformed by a plasmid is called a transformant . Cloning The process of obtaining a population of organisms or DNA sequences derived from one such organism or sequence by asexual reproduction. Cotransformation A process of transfecting appropriate cells with at least two distinct DNA sequences encoding proteins that interact after production in the host cell with each other. The cells that result from this process are called a cotransformants . As described above, the cotransformation process of this invention comprises the step of cotransforming an appropriate host cell with at least two DNA sequence that encode distinct protein products, the protein products of the sequences interacting with each other after their production in the host cell. In the general process of this invention, a wide variety of DNA sequences and host cells may be employed.For example, the host cells useful in the process may be eukaryotic or prokaryotic hosts, such as E.coli, Bacillus, yeast and plant and animal cells. Preferably, eukaryotic cells are used and most preferably mouse cells. The DNA sequences useful in this invention may also vary widely. For example, a DNA sequence coding for a particular protein and DNA sequences encoding the one or more enzymes that are required to glycosylate that protein may be used. In the preferred embodiment of this invention, which is described in more detail below, we employ the DNA sequences encoding the a and chains of human class II antigens, and preferably also the DNA sequence encoding the invariant In chain in our cotransformation. As described above the mouse cells of this invention are characterized by their cotransformation with DNA sequences encoding the a, ss chains and preferably, but not necessarily DNA sequences encoding the invariant chains In of human class II antigens and which as a result of that cotransformation express those DNA sequences, assemble their protein products intracellularly and transmit the assembled complex to the cell surface with the correct antigenic specificity. Such cotransformed cells may then be employed to produce hybridomas and from them monoclonal antibodies recognizing allospecific determinants of those class II antigens. There are at least three distinct types of class II antigens and antibodies that may be produced in accordance with this invention. Each is encoded in the HLA D region Figure I . They include the HIA DR antigens F. H. Bach BR J. J. VanRoad, N. Engl. J. Med., 295, pp. 806 13 1976 W. B. Bodmer et al., in Histocompatibility Testing, eds.W. H. Bodmer et al., Munksgaard, Copenhagen, Denmark 1978 R. J. Winchester and H. G. Kunkel, Ads. Immunol., 28, pp. 221 98 1980 J. L. Stromiger et al., in TheRole Of The Major Histocom patibility Complex In Immunology, ed. M. E. Dorf, Garland, New York, pp. 115 72 1981 the ELA DC antigens R. Tosi et al., J. Exp. Med., 148, pp. 1592 1611 1978 and the HLA SB antigens IS, Shaw et al., J. Exp. Med., 152, pp. 565 580 1980 . Moreover, this invention is also applicable to other species of human class II antigens. DNA sequences encoding these various class II antigens are available. For example, cDNA clones for the polymeric ss chain of HLA DR and ELA DC are described inE. O. Long et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 79, pp. 7465 69 1982 , cDNA clones for the non polymeric DR a chain are described in C. T. Wake et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 79, pp. 6969 83 1982 cDNA clones for the lILA DR a chain and HLA DC a chains are described in J. S. Lee et al.,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 79, pp. 545 49 1982 andC. Auffray et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 79, pp. 6337 41 1982 and cDNA clones for the RLA DC fi chains are described in K. Wiman et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.USA, 79, pp. 1703 07 1982 . In addition, cDNA clones coding for the DR associated invariant chain In are also available.Moreover, these cDNA clones may be employed to select the genomic DNA sequences encoding the desired chains J. Gorski et al., in press . See also description and deposits infra.We prefer to use genomic clones in the process of this invention. The mouse cells that are useful in accordance with this invention include generally all available mouse cell lines. These include, among others, mouse L cells E. C. Lai et al., Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77, pp. 244 48 1980 , macrophages, and ss lymphocytes. We prefer to employ mouse L tk cells in the preferred embodiments of this invention It is surprising that such mouse cells express the human class II DNA sequences which we employ to cotransform them because mouse fibroblasts do not normally express their own class II genes. Accordingly, the human DNA sequences that we have cotransfected into the mouse cells by the processes of this invention are believed to be under a different expression control than the counterpart mouse genes. Various methods of contransformation may be used in accordance with this invention. They may be selected from conventional transformation methods with due regard to the DNA sequences to be used and the characteristics of the host cells to be transformed. We prefer to employDNA mediated gene transfer into our preferred mouse cells substantially as described in A. Pellicer et al., Science, 209, pp. 1414 21 1980 and E. C. Lai et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77, pp. 244 48 1980 . For this cotransformation we employed at least three different DNA sequences a a DNA sequence encoding the polymeric ss chain of the desired Class II antigen b a DNA sequence encoding the a chain of that desired Class II antigen and c a DNA sequence encoding a selection marker. It should, however, be understood that the DNA sequence encoding the invariant chain In of the desired Class II antigen is also preferably used in our cotransformations. However, this lastDNA sequence may not be required, because some of our experiments demonstrate that the presence of the human invariant gene product in the cotransformed mouse cell is not essential for the surface production of the desiredClass II antigen. As selection markers, we prefer to employ the gene coding for Herpes Simplex Virus thymidine Rinase tk M. Perucho et al., Cell, 22, pp. 309 17 1980 . However, it should be understood that a variety of other selection markers are also useful. These include, for example, antibiotic resistance markers, like resistance to G418, metabolic inhibition markers, like mycophenolic acid, and mutant markers, like HGPRT negative strains, grown in HAT medium. All that is required is that some means be available to exert a positive pressure on the selection of correctly cotransformed cells. In the specific cotransformations described herein we linearized the genomic clones containing the variousDNA sequences with restriction endonucleases that cut the clones outside of those DNA sequences However, we did not ligate the various sequences together before cotransformation. It should, however, be understood that some or all of the DNA sequences employed in our cotransformations may be ligated in vitro before cotransformation of the chosen cells with them. The cotransformed mouse cells of our invention express these DNA sequences and assemble their protein products intracellularly and then transport that complex to the cell surface in correct antigen form. This expression is stable and we have observed it in some of our transformants for over four months. Moreover, the production of the desired antigens is not lost upon cultivation or passage of the cotransformants. The human Class 11 antigen positive mouse cells of our invention provide a new and unique source of humanClass II antigens More importantly, these mouse cells may be employed using standard immunization and selection techniques to prepare bybridomas that produce monoclonal antibodies recognizing allospecific determinants of those class II antigens. These specific antibodies may then be usefully employed in typing and therapeutic agents and processes. The monoclonal antibodies of this invention may be produced from the Class II antigens of this invention in a variety of standard ways. Preferably, the cotransformed mouse cells of this invention are employed to produce mouse mouse hybridomas that produce the desired monoclonal antibodies. The hybridomas of this invention are preferably prepared by first immunizing mice of the same genetic back ground as those used for our cotransformation with the cotransformed cells of this invention. This choice insures that the only non self protein made by the spleen cells of the immunized mouse is the desired Class II antigen.Of course, if a host cell other than mouse had been used in the original cotransformation, the host to be immunized should also be from that genetic type. The isolated spleen cells are then employed in a conventional manner to prepare a hybridoma by cell fusion. One example of a method of immunizing mice with an antigen and then employing spleen cells of that mouse in the formation of a mouse mouse hybridoma to produce an antibody specific to that antigen is described in European patent application 44441. In dur hybridoma preparations, we prefer to employ C3B mice for immunization with the cotransformed cells of this invention when we have usedL cells for cotransformation. We also prefer to employ a plasmacytoma mouse line which is defective in the production of its own immunoglobulin chain for subsequent hybridoma formation. We then screen the antibodies produced by resulting collection of hybridomas with a panel of cells having known DR specificities in microtiter wells and select for specific and partially specific binding to each antigen. This process enables us to select a specific monoclonal antibody recognizing the allospecific determinants of each Class II antigen. The antibodies of this invention will be more useful than previous Class II antibodies because the antibodies of this invention will be specific or private to a particular Class II specificity. In the terms of this invention, we describe that private specificity as an allospecificity to the Class II determinants. The allospecific antibodies produced in accordance with this invention may be employed in typing and therapeutic processes and compositions. Such typing and therapeutic uses of Class II antibodies are known. The antibodies of this invention, because they are allospecific, will allow more specific typing and more effective therapy than previous antibodies. It should also be understood that for typing or therapy, it is not necessary to employ the entire antibody of this invention. Instead, fragments of the antibody may be employed. Such fragments will be especially useful in therapeutic application because fragments of mouse made monoclonal antibodies are far less likely to be immunogenic in human use than the complete antibody. In order that this invention may be better understood, the following examples are set forth. These examples are for purposes of illustration only and this invention should not be considered to be limited by any recitation used therein. EXAMPLES A. COTRANSFORMATION OF MOUSE L tk CELLS We maintained the thymidine kinase tk deficient mouse L cell line Ltk a gift of P. Goldstein in monolayer cultures in Dulbecco s Modified Eagel medium DME , supplemented with heated 10 fetal calf serum 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 1 streptomycin and penicillin. We then cotransfected 3 x 106 ttk cells in 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks with our DNA sequences substantially as described by M. Wigler et al., Cell, 16, pp. 777 85 1979 . In this process, we incubated the Ltk cells for 7 h at 370C with calcium phosphate DNA precipitates and trypsin dispersed them into 9 wells of a 24 well tissue culture microplate Costar . After 24 h, we switched our cultures to hypoxactive aminopterin thymidine HAT selection medium and continued to grow them. We scored for positive tri cotransformants after 3 4 weeks and selected positive cotransformants from each well and maintained them in 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks.We number our positive cotransformants 11 to 19 and 221 to 229. For the above described cotransformations, we employed the following DNA sequences Transformation 1 We prepared a DNA sequence encoding a HLA DR chain by restricting genomic clone A DR ss 10 Figure 2 see also infra , prepared from a DR 4, W 6 DNA library in lambda Charon 30 vector LJ Gorski et al., in press withNru and employed 1 pg of that linearized fragment per 19 pg of Ltk DNA carrier. We also prepared 50 ng of HindIII linearized plasmid pAGO which carries the tk gene as a selective marker F. Colbere Garapin et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 76, pp. 3755 59 1979 . The transformation efficiency of this transformation was 18 for the 9 wells. cotransformatibn 22 In cotransformation 22, we employed 1 pg of the above described Nru linearized genomic clones DR ss 10 and also employed 1 pg of an EIA DR a chain related genomicDNA sequence A. J. Korman et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. SciUSA, 79, pp. 6013 17 1982 in A DR a ELA. Finally, we employed 3 pg of Sal I linearized cos In infra which contained a DNA sequence encoding the human invariant chain In in cosmid vector pOPFl F. G. Grosveld et al.,Gene, 13, pp. 227 37 1980 . This vector also provides the tk gene for use in selection. We employed these DNA sequences together with 14 pg of Ltk DNA carrier in Co transformation 22. The transformation efficiency in this cotransformation was 50 colonies for the 9 wells. B. DNA SEQUENCE EXPRESSION FROM COTRANSFORMED MOUSE L tk CELLS We first analyzed our 11 19 transformants and 221 229 cotransformants at the mRNA level using Northern blots. These analyses demonstrated that our selected tk cotransformants transcribed the DNA sequences encoding the human Class II antigens which we had used to transform them. We than analyzed our tk cotransformed cells for the presence of cell surface HLA DR antigen using three HLA DR monoclonal antibodies R. S. Accolla et al.,Eur. J. Immunol., 12, pp. 166 69 1982 S. Carrel et al.,Mol. Immunol., 18, pp. 403 11 19B1 J. We employed three methods in this analysis a cellular binding radioimmune assay, immunofluorescence analysis and immunoprecipitation of iodinated cell surface proteins followed by polyacrylamide gel analysis.In each analysis, we included as con trols Ltk cells, Ltk cells transformed with the DR p chain coding DNA sequence alone e.g. our transformant 14 , a human lymphoblastoid cell line HLA DR W6, and control antibodies such as HLA A, B, C and anti For the cell binding assays we distributed 5 x 106 cells in wells of V bottom microplates DynatechCorp. , centrifuged them at 40C and resuspended them in 25 l DME 2 FCS, containing 10 ê or 10 antibody dilution.After incubating the cells at 4 C with gentle shaking for 2 h, we washed the cells three times with DME 2 FCS and resuspended them in 25 p1 of that media, containing approximately 3.5 ng 105 cpm of 125I protein A Amersham Int.

Accordingly, these latter HLA DR antibodies are public not private mono clonal antibodies. We centrifuged 10000 rpm all antibody preparations for 15 min at 40C prior to use. We have displayed the results of the cellular binding radioimmunoassays in Table I.

As shown in Table I, all of the mouse cell lines react with H 2KK monoclonal antibodies. In addition, the human lymphobiastoid cell line HLA DR 4, W6 , which we used as the source of our genomic DNA sequences, reacts with the anti HLA DR monoclonal antibody mixture. Of the nine cell lines from cotransformation 22, three 224, 225 and 226 do not react with the anti DR monoclonals, five 221 222, 223, 227 and 228 are DR positive, although considerably less positive than the human cell control, and one 229 reacts strongly with the antibody pool and compares favorably with the human cell control. In contrast, untransformed Ltk cells and transformant 14 from transfection with the DR chain only are negative. We also performed some of these cell binding assays with various concentrations of the antibodies. It was evident from these assays that cotransformant 229 reacts to the antibodies at the same order of magnitude as the control D cell line. We have also confirmed the production of theseHLA DR antigens by indirect immunofluorescence analysis.We conducted this assay by incubating 5 x 105 cells for 30 min in ice with 25 p1 of 10 2 dilutions of the above described monoclonal antibodies. After washing the cells three times in DME 10 FCS , we again incubated them for 30 min at 40C in the presence of 5 p1 rhodamine labelled rabbit anti mouse Ig antiserum and then washed the cells three times with PBS BSA 10 . We then spread a drop of the resulting cell suspension with a cytofuge on microscope slides and air dried and fixed it with methanol. After mounting the slide in glycerol, we examined it with a Zeiss photomicroscope II, equipped wit an epifluorescent condensorRS III. Because our cotransformants were propagated and analyzed as mixtures of tk clones originating from each well, we expect that each culture contains several different clones. Accordingly, it may be that cultures showing the weaker reactivity merely have a larger percentage of DR members than DR members. Finally, we analyzed the HLA DR antigens produced at the surface of our cotransformed mouse cells by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In these analyses, we labelled the cell surface proteins with 125I by iodinating 6 x 106 cels with 150 Ci 125I iodine 3.7 GBq ml,Amersham Int. , substantially as described by A. L. Hubbard and Z. A. Cohn, J. Cell. Biol. 55, pp. 390 405 1972 . We then incubated the freshly iodinated cells with 400 lPBS, containing 10 pl of the mixture of HLA DR monoclonal antibodies, as described above. After 2 h at 40C, we washed each sample three times with cold PBS, lysed the cells with 0.4 ml buffer 150 mM NaCl, 1 deoxycholate, 1 Triton X 100, 0.1 SDS and 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.8 , sonicated them for 15 sec and centrifuged them for 15 min at 40C in an Eppendorf centrifuge. We then immunoprecipitated the cell lysates and bound the antigen antibody complex to protein A sepharose, as described by E. O. Long et al., EMBO S., 1, pp. 649 54 1982 . We eluted the labelled product from the proteinA sepharose CL 4B beads by boiling for 3 min in 10 mM TrisHCl pH 6.8 , 15 glycerol, 2 SDS, 0.001 bromophenol blue and an aliquot loaded onto a 12.5 polyacrylamide gel.After gel electrophoresis, we fixed the gel, dried it and exposed it to preflashed Kodak X AR films with intensifying screens for I day and six days. In this analysis, the pattern of cell surfaceHLA DR a and ss chains that we observed from the control ss cell line F. A. Lemonnier et al., Immunogenetics, 16, pp. 355 61 1982 3 was similar to that observed from our cotransformed cell line 229. However, the mobility of the ss chain from our cotransformed cell line was slightly slower than the chain from the control. This slight difference could reflect a difference in the glycosylation pattern of the antigen a difference that does not prevent recognition of the protein by anti ELA DR. With mouseLtk cells and transformed cells 14, we did not observe any polypeptide chain precipitation with the HLA DR antibody mixture. C. USE OF MOUSE CELLS CARRYING HUMAN HLA DR ANTIGENS ON THEIR SURFACE TO PRODUCE MOUSE MOUSE HYBRIDOMAS PRODUCING ALLOSPECIFIC KL A DR MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES The above described cotransformed cells that produce ELA DR antigens at their surface may be used, as previously described, to form mouse mouse hybridomas that produce allospecific monoclonal antibodies to those antigens. For this purpose we use our cotransformed mouse cells e.g. 229 to immunize mice by standard procedures to obtain in those mice a specific immunogenic response to the cell surface antigens of the cotransformed mousse cells. To produce hybridomas we fuse spleen cells of the immunized mice to plasmacytoma lines which are defective in the production of its own immunoglobulin chain.Following selection, we screen our mouse mouse hybridomas for anti ELA DR activity by large scale ELIZA or radioimmunoassay and for activity against a given DR specificity by assay with a panel of known DR positive cells.
