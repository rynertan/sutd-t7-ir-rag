# Apparatus for attaching fasteners to web like materials.

## Abstract
An apparatus for attaching a fastener such as a snap closure composed of a first fastener member A and a second fastener member B to be combined together through a web like material F such as a fabric therebe tween, includes a lower pocket mechanism 12 for support ing the second fastener member B thereon, a punch mechanism 19 movable toward the lower pocket mechan ism 12 for fixing the first fastener member A to the second fastener member B with the web like material F inter posed therebetween, and an upper pocket mechanism 11 for supporting the first fastener member A , the upper pocket mechanism 11 being movable toward the lower pocket mechanism 12 and having means for centering the first fastener member A in alignment with the second fastener member B . A safety mechanism 20 is operatively coupled with the upper pocket mechanism 11 for actuating the punch mechanism 19 only when the upper pocket mechanism 11 reaches a predetermined position with respect to the lower pocket mechanism 12 . A feeder mechanism 16 has first and second hoppers 105, 106 for storing the first and second fastener members A, B therein and first and second pickup means movable rectilinearly for feeding the first and second fastener members A, B out of the first and second hoppers 105, 106 into the first and second pocket mechanisms 11, 12 , respectively.
