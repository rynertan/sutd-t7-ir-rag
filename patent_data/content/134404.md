# Method and apparatus for target deactivation and reactivation.

## Abstract
Targets 14 mounted on objects 12 for detection by a magnetic type theft detection system are deactivated in a target deactivator 26 which has magnet assembly made up of spaced apart magnets with alternately opposed poles extending in a plane and guide walls 36, 38 extending perpendicular to the plane. Targets 14 are reactivated by a reactivator 46 having a magnet 52 mounted thereon and arranged to be slid along the target 14 .
