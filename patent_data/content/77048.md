## Description
BOAT FOR THE RECOVERY OF FLOATING MATERIALSThis invention relates to a boat for the recovery of floating materials, e.g. from fresh or salt water.The most important product to be recovered, due to its economic and ecological implications, is oil. The phenomenon of the black tide is well known. Technical and economic efforts to solve the problem have not met with satisfactory results. As is well known, the proven reserves of petroleum, worldwide, will be exhausted in some 40 years the price of crude oil increases with ever increasing speed, having repercussions on the manufacturing costs of virtually every type of product, since most include an energy component in the make up of their total cost directly or indirectly . Society is not as yet able to satisfy its energy requirements from non petroleum sources.Consequently, all countries of the world are conscious of the utmost importance of recovering oil spilled into the sea this arising from a variety of circumstances, as for example, collisions, oil tanker hull cleaning, etc. It can be said that of even more importance is the pollution of the water resulting from such spillages of oil, petroleum and other liquids, which being of a lower density than the water remain floating on its surface. An object of the invention is to provide a simple and effective means for recovery of floating materials, e.g. oil.In accordance with the invention, this is achieved by a boat characterized by first separation means for the separation of liquids and by second separation means for the removal of solid matter from said liquids, said second separation means being arranged to function independently of said first separation means.To facilitate explanation, the accompanying drawings show by way of non limiting example, one embodiment of a boat for the recovery of materials floating in water, in accordance with the present invention.In the drawings Figure 1 shows a lateral elevation Figure 2 shows a plan view andFigure 3 an end view of the boat andFigure 4 shows a perspective view of a decanting ar rangement and liquid separator which forms part of the boat.The boat described in this specification comprises two main distinct items of equipment a a liquid liquid separation device for the recovery of less dense products petroleum, oil, etc. and b a separation device 2, 9 for the removal of solid objects or matter from the water. Referring now to the drawings in more detail, there is ilIustrated device a having a suction inlet 1, situated slightly below the free surface of the water to take in a water oil mixture retaining any solid bodies on a separator or filter grid 2, which latter is part of the device b and consists of a plate perforated with vertical slots . The suction tube 1 of a special shape takes the mixture on to a suction means 3, this being possibly a pump, reversed liquid compressor, etc. The mixture is sent through a tube 4 forming a lower entry port to a settling tank 5 in a continuous or semi continuous operation, such as the well known Florentine vessel , or any other type of liquid liquid separator which fulfills the required purpose. The separator 5 is provided with at least one pair of transverse partitions defining separate compartments within a chamber.The oil overflows from the final compartment via an outlet 6 passing to an oil storage tank 7. The water is extracted from the final compartment of the separator by means of a variable flow pump via a tube 8 such that the level of the oil in the last compartment of the separator remains constant during the separation process. As illustrated, the separator chamber is preferably situated centrally of the boat hull. The oil extracted passes to a storage vessel 7 preferably situated at the front of the boat hull.The device b for the extraction of solid matter floating on the water in which the boat is operating, consists essentially of a shovel 9 at the prow of the boat and has the grid 2, mentioned previously. The shovel 9 is rigidly secured to two lateral arms which are articulated at their ends opposite to those fixed to the shovel 9, such that the arms can adopt a vertical position as shown in dashed lines in Figure 1 , allowing the solid matter to fall from the shovel for evacuation thereof, whence they are collected due to the opening of the grid 2 which has swung on its hinges to the position shown in dashed line in Figure 1 in a collecting vessel provided for this purpose.The collecting vessel is removable so that it may be lifted with a small crane not shown in the drawings for periodic emptying. Pivotting of the arms to the vertical position preferably takes place driven by an actuating motor, e.g. an electric motor. Opening and closing of the grid 2 may be automatic.The devices a , for the separation and the recovery of valuable liquids, and b , for the removal of solids floating in the water, are fitted to a floating arrangement which consists essentially of two suitable floats 10, placed symmetrically with respect to the central axis of the boat, logitudinally, held by a frame which comprises cross members 11 and on which is fitted a platform or floor 12. The floats 10 are attached to the frame by means of bolts such that they may be dismantled and changed for others of different dimensions, to suit the level of the line of flotation, this being a function of the density of the water and the total weight of the boat with its corresponding equipment, in working condition.Similarly there may be provided frames and equipment of various sizes which can be fitted to the floats 10 in dependence upon the area of the surface of the water to be dealt with, so as to optimize the operating time and hence the final cost. The boat is powered, for its own autonomy of movement, by means of a motor which drives a propellor, fitted in the stern, through a transmission, gear change and suitable clutch. The boat is also fitted with a rud det such that the boat can move in any required direction at a speed appropriate to the particular situation.The boat is controlled from a cabin 13 in which are situated the controls for the equipment, as described, for separators a , b , the driving mechanisms and the rudder.The cabin has sufficient space and visibility so that the pilot has access to all the controls and can carry out the various operations for which the boat is designed.
