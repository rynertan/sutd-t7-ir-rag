# Action for electronic piano.

## Abstract
A piano action is provided for an electronic piano. Tones are generated electronically, but the action retains the feel of a conventional piano action without the necessity of a hammer or hammer like member. The piano key 28 is provided with a rounded, convex shoulder 58 which presses against a rounded, convex surface 86 on a lever 74 . The two convex surfaces are configured and positioned so that one slides over the other to provide the feel of let off of a conventional piano action. The lever is spring biased by means of two different springs 94, 114 to rest position, and acts to move a spring wire contact 118 from a first bus 116 to a second bus 120 .
