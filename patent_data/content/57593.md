## Description
COMPRESSIBLE PHOTOPOLYMER PRINTING PLATE The present invention relates to a sheet containing a photopolymer, monomer and initiator suitable for use as a relief printing plate, which sheet is bonded to a compressible foam material which is in turn bonded to a dimensionally stable backing material. U. S. Patents 2,760,863 3,024,180 3,261,686 and 3,764,324 describe soft and hard, flexible and rigid photopolymer compositions in sheet form that are imaged and processed to finished relief printing plates. None of the processes disclosed therein involves the incorporation of a compressible foam layer into the sheet to produce a compressible relief printing plate. U. S. Patent 4,042,743 discloses a process to produce a compressible offset printing blanket by the incorporation of resin microballoons into the blanket thereby forming a compressible layer. One technique which is flown to produce a compressible layer in offset blankets is to incorporate air into the blanket cement followed by vulcanization to the blanket face. Another technique is to impregnate a highly porous felted fibrous web with an elastomeric material in solution followed by vulcanization. None of these methods describes the incorporation of a compressible layer onto the sheet material used to form the photopolymer printing plate such that the sheet can be exposed and processed to a finished printing plate that exhibits compressibilty during printing and permits wide impression latitude. Such a wide impression latitude permits the printing of uneven substrates, and the use of presses with lower accuracy in the press cylinders without adversely affecting print quality. The incorporation of an integral compressible layer into the sheet avoids the problems of mounting of flexographic plates on compressible foam tapes. This mounting technique has the problem of the tape stretching during mounting, the tearing of the tape when the plates are positioned and repositioned during plate registration.The aforesaid foam tape mounting technique also has the problem of the tape tearing when plates are demounted and remounted for repeated use. The use of an integral foam backed photopolymer plate in accordance with the present invention permits the use of a much wider range of properties of the compressible layer compared to foam mounting tapes because the integral foam is not subject to the stretching and tearing that foam mounting tapes must resist. Compressible printing plates of the type manufactured and used pursuant to the present invention are particularly useful in A. printing on wide webs films of cellophane, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester, vinyl and saser where web 27 .0127to 0.127 where thickness is in the range of about1 2 to 5 milts, In wide web printing roll, sag and distortion and machine gauge variation are overcome by the compressibility of foam. B. printing on corrugated cardboard where compressibility in foam allows the plate to apply constant pressure to un even surfaces giving an even ink laydown for uniform print. C. printing safety papers checks, bond and stock forms with even uniform constant tone in background print. D. process printing 4 color printing where uniformity of ink laydown is critical to proper color development. A compressible plate also has longer life. The mechanical shock to the plate, in each print motion, causes a gradual wearing of the relief, gradually leading to loss of sharpness in print.Compressible foam absorbs the mechanical shock leaving the relief printing surface relatively unaffected minimal flattening or distortion resulting in longer plate life. The use of an integral foam backed photopolymer plate also permits the use of photographic pin registration systems which permit pre registration of multiple plate images as used in multicolor printing . This allows rapid and in most cases instant registration of multiple plates when mounted on presses as with most photopolymer plates. A feature of this invention is that these pin registration systems may now be used with a plate that has the advantages of a compressible backing. This is impossible with foam mounting tapes. As in the typical flexographic photopolymer printing plate, the plate of the present invention combines three elements 1. A relief or image layer which is sensitive to ultraviolet light. 2. A backing layer which may or may not be sensitive to ultraviolet light that is used to build the relief layer to the proper printing height. 3. A dimensionally stable backing layer that supports the layers described above and prevents dimensional changes in the plate images which would adversely affect the printing ability of the plate. These layers are laminated to form a sheet. To convert the sheet into a flexographic printing plate, the image layer is covered by a black and transparent film of the desired printing copy, and exposed to actinic usually ultraviolet radiation through the transparency. The light which passes through the transparent portions causes polymerization or crosslinking of the photopolymer that causes insolubilization of the exposed areas. After irradiation, the sheet is washed with a solvent usually a halogenated hydrocarbon which removes the unexposed soluble areas of the plate. After oven drying, the sheet is now a rubber printing plate. The present invention involves the addition of a fourth element to the photopolymer printing plate between the second and third layers described above. This layer consists of an oDen or closed cell foam with a density of from 32 to 801 kg m3 2 to 50 lbs ft3 , desirably of from 288 to 480 kg m3 18 to 30 lbs ft3 , in a thickness of 0.250 to 6.35 mm 0.010 to 0.250 depending on the thickness of the plate needed. This element is applied to the image layer via lamination of the foam to said layer as described hereinafter. In order for the plates of the present invention to be used effectively in the applications listed above, a suitable amount of foam should be present in the plate. For example, if the total plate thickness is less than 2.54 mm 0.100 , the preferable foam thickness in said plate should be about 0.511 mm 0.02 .If the total plate thickness is between 2.54 mm and 4.32 mm 0.100 and 0.170 , the preferable foamfoam should be about 1.021 mm 0.04 . If the total platefthickness is greater than 4.72 mm 0.170 up to about 2.35 mm 0.250 , the preferable foam thickness should be about 2.03 mm 0.080 . The foam used should possess a good recovery rate, compression value and appropriate density for the end use. The recovery rate of the foam is measured by determining the percent of the original foam thickness that the foam returns to in a given unit of time after compression. In the instant case, 17578 kg mê 25 p.s.i. is applied for ten seconds via a 12.7 mm one half inch diameter plate on the sample. The plate is removed and the foam sample is allowed to recover for ten seconds. The foam is then measured and the percentage of recovery calculated. The foam used in accordance with the present invention for all thicknesses should possess the property that the percent of the original thickness recovered at the end of ten seconds after 17578 kg mê 25 p.s.i. for ten second should be 80 or greater, preferably greater than 92 The compression value of the foam is obtained using the recovery rate method described above. The value is obtained by measuring the extent that the foam remains compressed after ten seconds of the aforesaid pressure. The compression and density values are set forth in Table 1 below TABLE 1Total Plate 2.54 2.54 4.32 4.32 6.35 Thickness inch 0.100 0.100 0.170 0.170 0.250Foam mm 0.508 1.016 2.032Thickness inch 0.020 0.040 0.080Foam mm O.076 0.254 0.508Compression Preferred inch 0.003 0.010 0.020 Maximum mm 0.127 0.508 0.762 inch 0.005 0.020 0.030 kg m 480 320 320Density lbs. ft3 30 20 20 Preferred foams are all closed cell with no skin such as vinyl, polyurethane, EPDM and polyolefin. The foams must be compatible with solvents used, e.g. not dissolved, weakened swelled, etc. The foam layer is preferably provided with adhesive on both sides of the foam. This adhesive is desirably in a smooth glassy finish to provide a solvent impermeable bond to a smooth glassy polyester or metal backing and to a smooth glassy photopolymer. Use of a matte finish on the photopolymer, foam adhesive or metal backing which results in less than intimate contact between the surfaces may result in solvent attack during plate washout with resultant delamination of the photopolymer, foam and backing. This would then necessitate the use of solvent resistant adhesives which are difficult to apply.The foam layer is first applied to a dimensionally stable supporting layer. In the preferred method of manufacture the photopolymer with or without the carrier backing is pre back exposed to ultraviolet light with the normal amount of back exposure used for the plate thickness being used so that the re sulting base formed can support a relief image after processing. If the carrier backing is used, it is now stripped from the plate. The pre exposed photopolymer without the carrier backing is then laminated to the foam with dimensionally stable backing to produce an integral compressible photopolymer plate material that can be processed normally to a finished compressible photopolymer plate. The relief or image layer mentioned above is a blend of a photopolymer, between 5 and 30 phr of an ethylenically unsaturated monomer and between 0.1 and 5 phr of a photoinitiator sensitive to actinic radiation. Preferred compositions and methods of preparing same as used in this layer are disclosed in United Kingdom Patents 1,358,062 and 1,395,822, and U.S. Patent Applica tion Serial Number 96,608 filed November 21, 1968, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein. Preferred ethylenically unsaturated monomers used herein are trimethylolpropane triacrylate, pentaerythritol tetraacrylate, 1,6 hexanediol diacrylate, triacrylate of tris 2 hydroxyethyl isocyanurate, dipentaerythritol monohydroxypentaacrylate, trimethylolpropane ethoxylate triacrylate and 1,6 hexanediol dimethacrylate. Preferred photoinitiators are benzophenone, 2,2 dimethoxy 2phenylacetophenone, isobutyl benzoin ether, benzoin methyl ether and 2,2 diethoxyacetophenones. In this invention any photopolymer can be used as long as it can be produced with no backing. The unbacked material is preferred with a smooth glassy surface for easy bonding to the foam however, other methods of bonding are possible. It is also preferred that the photopolymer be capable of holding its back exposure or not require a back exposure to facilitate maximum detail reproduction of the photopolymer plate material. Also the preferred photopolymer should be extensible enough to allow the construction 12.54 to 15.24 cm to be flexible enough to be wrapped around small diameter 1 to 6 inch plate cylinders without buckling. Preferred also is a dimen sionally stable polymer which will not shrink on face exposure facilitating its use in close plate to plate registration printing as required in four color process printing. In this invention the preferred method of bonding is by the use of highly tacky adhesives or adhesive tapes however, other bonding is not excluded, such as urethane, epoxy, cyanoacrylate, anaerobic or hot melt bonding. These methods should, of course, preferably produce a flexible construction. Figure 1 depicts a side view of the various layers of the sheet construction after assembly. The base area depicted may have the same composition as and be homogeneous with the polymer layer or it may be a separate layer with a different composition. The base layer is present to support the printing relief images present after exposure of the plate and washing with solvent. The following examples are presented by way of illustration and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. EXAMPLE 1 A plate was formed using the following materials Photopolymer sheet 2.032 mm 0.08011 butadiene acrylonitrile rubber NBR , acrylate monomer and benzophenone at 100 20 2 ratio Two sided close cell vinyl foam tape 1.092 mm 0.04311 0.127 mm 0.00511 Polyester Film The photopolymer sheet 1.905 mm .075 , which is contained between two protective polyester sheets 0.127 mm .00511 , is pre back exposed for one minute with ultraviolet radiation. The protective backing polyester sheet is removed leaving intact the protective cover sheet which contains a transferable 0.005 mm .0002 thick release film.The 1.092 mm .043 tape supported with a silicone coated polyester film is laminated via a two roll laminator set at a 1.168 mm .046 gap to the 0.127 mm .00511 polyester film.The gap of the two roll laminators is reset to 3.048 mm .120 . The release polyester film is removed from the vinyl foam bonded to the 0.127 mm .005 polyester backing. This is then passed throughthe laminator nip with the unbacked pre exposed photopolymer. The finished laminate is heated to 65.50C 1500F for 20 minutes to stress relieve the photopolymer. It is then cooled. This produces a sheet of integrally compressible photopolymer material 3.175 mm .125 thick ready for customer imagine The unexpected and unique feature of this plate is its ability to tolerate wide impression changes 0.508 mm or .020 , when printing, without complete destruction of the plate or the print quality. This eliminates press bounce and haloing normally associated with high impression 0.127 to 0.381 mm .005 to .015 in flexo printing. It also permits the use of presses with inaccurate press cylinders and bearings and allows substrates with poor gauge tolerance If0.127 mm or 0.005 to be readily printed with good quality. The NBR most suitable for use pursuant to the present invention contains 2 to 50 by weight copolymerized acrylonitrile.EXAMPLE II Using the procedure outlined in Example I an unbacked photopolymer sheet 1.655 mm .065 , styrenebutadiene styrene block copolymer comprising acrylate, monomer and benzophenone at a 100 10 2 ratio, is spray coated with a hot melt adhesive dissolved in a suitable solvent. The hot melt adhesive is a low temperature activated type 65.5 36.70C or 150 1700F . A polyester backing film of 0.123 mm .005 thickness is also spray coated with this adhesive. A closed cell PVC foam sheet of 1.016 mm .040 thickness and the adhesive coated polyester sheet are then heated to 71.1 C 1600F in a forced air oven for two minutes. They are then removed and quickly bonded together via a two roll laminator as described inExample I. The foam and backing are again heated along with the unbacked adhesive coated photopolymer in the forced air oven at 65.50C 1500 for 2 minutes.They are removed and bonded together via the two roll laminator. This compressible photopolymer sheet is imaged by exposure to ultraviolet light through a photographic negative and washout in perchlorsethylene. EXAMPLE III Using the procedure described in Example II, a solvent based two component urethane adhesive was substituted for the hot melt adhesive. The adhesive was allowed to dry until tacky and then bonded without the need for heat.EXAMPLE IV Using the procedures outlined in Example I, an unbacked photopolymer sheet comprising styrene isoprenestyrene block copolymer, methacrylate monomer and benzophenone at a 100 10 2 ratio was used. A two sided foam tape 2.034 mm 0.08 thick was bonded to a polyester backing 0.123 mm .005 thick. This was in turn bonded to the unbacked 4.45 mm 0.175 thick photopolymer sheet described above. This produces a 6.607 mm .260 thick integrally compressible photopolymer sheet that is imaged to a finished compressible photopolymer plate as described in ExampleII.
