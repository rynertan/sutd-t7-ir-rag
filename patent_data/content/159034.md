# Cardiovascular graft and method forming same.

## Abstract
The method for forming a biocompatible polymer graft particularly adapted for cardiovascular use comprises the steps of choosing a suitable, non sovent, two component, hydrophilic of hydrophobic biocompatible polymer system from which the graft may be formed choosing a suitable water soluble inorganic salt to be compounded with the biocompatible polymer system grinding the salt crystals and passing same through a sieve having a pre determined mesh size drying the salt crystals compounding the salt crystals with the biocompatible polymer system forming a tube from said compounded salt and polymer system by reaction injection or cast molding and leaching the salt crystals from the formed tube with water, said leaching of said salt crystals providing a tube with a network of interconnecting cells formed in the area from whch the salt crystals have been leached. Further, according to the present invention, there is also provided a graft particularly adapted for cardiovascular use, said graft comprising a tube which has been reaction injection molded, cast molded, or extruded from a non solvent, two component hydrophilic or hydrophobic biocompatible polymer system and which has a honeycomb of interconnecting cells throughout the thickness of its wall formed by the leaching of a compounded inorganic salt therefrom.
