# Selective material projection imaging system using nuclear magnetic resonance.

## Abstract
Two dimensional projection measurements are formed of the NMR activity within a volume. These represent dif ferent properties of the materials within the volume includ ing density, the longitudinal relaxation time and the spin spin relaxation time. The measurements of the different properties are processed to produce projection images of specific materials within the volume. Projection images are also obtained of specific regions within the volume.
