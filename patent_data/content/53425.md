# VEHICLE REAR VIEW MIRROR ASSEMBLIES

## Abstract
This invention relates to rear view mirror assem blies. Figure 1 shows a rear view mirror assembly, gener ally indicated at 10, having a mirror 12. A wiper blade 15 is mounted on an arm 16 to wipe across the surface of the mirror 12. The arm 16 is mounted by means of a movable carriage 18 on a double helical screw 19. The double helical screw 19 is drivingly connected to a motor 22. The carriage 18 engages the helical screw 19 such that on rotation of the screw 19 the carriage 18 is driven axially back and forth along the screw 19. This movement causes the wiper blade 15 to be swept across the surface of the mirror 12 within the area of delineated by the line 37. Alternatively, the carriage 18 may be driven by a single handed lead screw, the direction of rotation of the motor being reversed each time the wiper blade 15 reaches the end of a sweep across the mirror 12. Thus, the wiper blade 15 and arm 16 can be parked to one side of the mirror 12 where they do not obstruct the central portion of mirror 12. It is particularly envisaged that such rear view mirrors would be used on trucks and other commercial vehicles.
