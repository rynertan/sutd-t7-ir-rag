## Description
1,4 DIHYDROPYRIDINE 5 PHOSPHONIC ACID ESTER The present invention relates to a novel 1,4 dihydropyridine 5 phosphonic acid ester, a process for the preparation thereof, and an antihypertensive or coronary or peripheral vasodilator composition containing the ester or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Namely, the present invention provides a novel 1,4dihydropyridine 5 phosphonic acid ester represented by the general formula EMI1.1 where RÚ is a hydrogen atom, a chlorine atom, a nitro group or a trifluoromethyl group, Rê is a hydrogen atom, a chlorine atom or a trifluoromethyl group, and each ofR3 and R4 is an alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms or a methoxyethyl group, or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The compound of the formula I or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt according to the present invention is useful as an antihypertensive drug or as a coronary or peripheral vasodilator. Some of the compounds of the formula I have optical isomers or diastereomers. The present invention covers such optical isomers and diastereomers. Further, the present invention provides a process for producing the compound of the formula I, which comprises reacting a phosphonate derivative represented by the general formula EMI2.1 where R11 R2, R3 and R4 are as defined above, with a compound represented by the formula EMI2.2 and optionally converting the resulting compound of the formula I to its pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The starting compound of the formula II may be obtained by reacting a 8 ketophosphonate derivative with an aldehyde in accordance with a conventional technique.Likewise, the starting compound of the formula III can readily be obtained by reacting the corresponding carbonyl compound with ammonia. The starting compound of the formula III may be formed in the reaction system by mixing the corresponding carbonyl compound with ammonia and is not necessarily required to be isolated. The reaction of the phosphonate derivative of the formula II with the compound of the formula III is usually conducted in an inert solvent. The inert solvent includes an alcohol solvent such as methanol, ethanol, propanol or isopropanol, an ether solvent such as 1,2dimethoxyethane or THF, an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent such as benzene, toluene or xylene, a nitrile solvent such as acetonitrile or benzonitrile, an amido solvent such as DAM, DMF or N methylpyrrolidone, a sulfoxide solvent such as DMSO or sulfolane, an ester solvent such as ethyl acetate or butyrolactone, or pyridine. The reaction is usually conducted at a temperature of from room temperature to 2000C, preferably from 60 to l400C, for from 1 to 100 hours, preferably from 5 to 20 hours. 1,4 Dihydropyridines are known to be useful for the medical treatment of coronary heart diseases, cerebral diseases, hypertension or arrhythmia, as they are capable of inhibiting the contraction of smooth muscle and cardiac muscle by calcium antagonistic effects see A.Fleckenstein, Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol., 17, 149 166 1977 . However, the majority of 1,4 dihydropyridines known or being developed are substituted at the 3 and 5 positions by a carboxylic acid ester group. Further, these 1,4 dihydropyridines, such as Nicardipine, have a side effect of tachycardia, and the duration of their antihypertensive effect is relatively short. The present inventors have studied dihydropyridines.As a result, it has been unexpectedly found that the 1,4 dihydropyridine 5 phosphonate derivatives of the present invention are not only effective for inhibiting the contraction of cardiac muscle by the calcium antagonistic effects but also substantially free from the effect to increase the heart rate i.e. the side effect of tachycardia, which is observed with Nicardipine.Further, some of the compounds of the present invention have a longer antihypertensive effectiveness thanNicardipine. 1,4 Dihydropyridine 5 phosphonate derivatives are disclosed in a few prior art references. However, none of them suggests or indicates the specific compounds of the present invention. Namely, A.I. Razumov et al. synthesized a 1,4 dihydropyridine 4 alkyl 5 phosphonate derivative Zh.Obshch. Khim., 47, 1190 1191 1977 and ibid., 51, 547 552 1981 . Further, Von K. Issleib et al.synthesized 1, 4 dihydropyridine 4 aryl 5 phosphonates more specifically, diethyl 2, 6 dimethyl 4 phenyl 3 ethoxycarbonyl 1,4 dihydropyridine 5 phosphonate and diethyl 2,6 dimethyl 4 4 methoxyphenyl 3 ethoxy carbonyl 1,4 dihydropyridine 5 phosphonate J. Prakt.Chem., Vol. 318, 207 220 1976 . None of these references indicates the pharmacological activities. Furthermore, U.K. Patent Application GB 2105989A discloses a wide range of 1,4 dihydropyridine 5phosphonate derivatives by a general formula, and teaches that the compounds represented by the general formula have cardiac activities. However, the specific compounds of the present invention and their specific activities are not disclosed or suggested by the U.R. PatentApplication. As mentioned above, the compounds of the present invention are not only capable of inhibiting the contraction of smooth muscle and cardiac muscle by the calcium antagonistic effects but also antihypertensively effective when administered orally. Thus, they are useful for the medical treatment of the coronary heart diseases, cerebral diseases or hypertension of mammals. Thus, the present invention provides an antihypertensive agent and coronary or peripheral vasodilator composition comprising an effective amount of the compound of the formula I or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt, and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. Such a composition may also be formulated into a veterinary composition by combining the compound of the present invention with a veterinarily acceptable diluent or carrier. Such compositions may be used in the form suitable for oral administration, e.g. tablets or capsules, in the form suitable for transdermal administration, e.g. ointments or plasters, in the form suitable for inhalation, e.g. aerosols or solutions suitable for spraying, in the form suitable for injection administration, e.g. a sterilized aqueous solution, or in the form of a suppository suitable for use in anus, vagina or rectum. The composition of the present invention usually contains the compound of the formula I in an amount of from about 0.1 to about 99.5 by weight, preferably from about 0.5 to about 95 by weight, based on the total weight of the composition. The compound of the present invention or the composition of the present invention may be used in combination with other pharmaceutically or veterinarily active compounds. Further, the composition of the present invention may contain a plurality of the compounds of the formula I. The daily dose of the compound of the formula I may be varied depending upon the type and the condition of the desease to be cured and the type of the patient the age, sex, sensitivity, etc. . In the case of the intravenous administration, the daily dose is usually from 0.0001 to 10 mg, preferably from 0.0005 to 1 mg, of the active ingredient per 1 kg of the body weight.Likewise, in the case of the oral or transdermal administration, the daily dose is usually from 0.001 to 100 mg of the active ingredient per 1 kg of the body weight. Further, the daily dose in the case of the administration in the form of a suppository to e.g. a vagina or rectum, is usually from 0.001 to 200 mg, preferably from 0.005 to 100 mg, of the active ingredient per 1 kg of the body weight. The content of the active ingredient in an aerosol, is usually from 0.1 to 10 by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 2 by weight. Such a daily dose may be divided for administration twice or more times per day. The above mentioned composition containing the compound of the formula I may be prepared by a conventional method, and a conventional excipient may be incorporated therein. Referring to the formula I, it is preferred that R is an alkyl group having 2 to 8 carbon atoms and R4 is an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms or a methoxy ethyl group. In another preferred embodiment, R1 or R2 is a hydrogen atom. Likewise, in a further preferred embodiment, R is an ethyl group and R4 is an methyl or ethyl group.
