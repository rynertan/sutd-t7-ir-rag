## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN MACHIhTES FOR APPLYING BAGS OR SACKS TO THE DISCHARGE SPOUTS OF BAG FILLING MACHINES .Background of the Invention The present invention relates to the machine for applying bags or sacks to the discharge spouts of bag filling machines. More particularly, the invention relates to bag applying machines having a suction transfer device for advancing a bag towards the discharge spout of a filling machine and comprising opposed suction means for engaging opposite sides of the bag adjacent its mouth, and means for parting said opposed suction means so as to open the bag mouth for placing over the discharge spout. The bags or sacks handled by the machines may be made from paper, PVC or other plastics material. United Kingdom Patent specification No.1439687 describes a bag applying machine comprising a suction pickup device which lifts a bag from a stack of flat bags and turns the bag from the horizontal position into a substantially vertical position, with its mouth disposed along one vertiral side edge of the bag, and a suction transfer device which engages the bag held by the pick up device, advances the bag from the pick up device into an upright rosition adjacent the discharge spout of a bag filling machine,, with the bag mouth uppermost, and opens t 8 bag mouth for placing over the discharge spout. The pick up device comprises a pair of pick up arms rockable about a horizontal axis and carrying suction cups for gripping a bag.The stack of bags to be fed to the machine is disposed to one side of the machine and the pick up arms rock downr ardly to engage the suction cups with the top bag in the stack.Suction is thereupon applied to the cups so that they grip the bag and the arms are swung upwardly in a vertical arc to move the bag from the horizontal position, in which it is removed from the stack, into a substantially vertical position with its mouth disposed along one vertical side edge of the bag. In this position, the bag is gripped adjacent its mouth by the suction transfer device which comprises a pair of transfer arms pivoted on a horizontal axis ar right angles to the pivot axis of the pick up device and having pairs of opposed suction cups for engaging opposite sides of the bag. Suction is applied to the transfer suction cups, which grip the bag, and is removed from the pickup suction cups, which release the bag, and the transfer device then swings upwardly to remove the bag from the pick up device and advance it to the discharge spout of the bag filling machine.At the same time, the transfer arms are moved apart so that the mouth of the bag is opened and placed over the discharge spout. With a transfer device as described in the aforementioned specification, and other knowntypes of transfer device, the open mouth of the bag is not formed to a satisfactory configuration for presentation to the discharge spout of the filling machine and, frequently, results in failure of the mouth to slip over the spout, or incorrect positionirb on the spout. and improper operation of the filling process. Moreover, because the pick up device comprises arms which swing in a vertical ac A are c turn the bag into a substantial vertical position for engagement by the transfer device, the pick up device cannot commence its next cycle until the bag has been removed from its path of movement by the transfer device, thereby reducing the speed of operation of the machine. Moreover, only one pickup device can be provided for feeding the transfer device.Summary of the Invention It is an object of the present invention to provide a bag applying machine having a suction transfer device which is adapted to open the mouth of a bag advanced by the device and to form the open bag mouth into a satisfactory configuration for placing over the discharge spout of a filling machine so that bags are systematically placed in the correct position on the discharge pout.To this end, according to the invention, the suction means of the transfer device comprises opposed main suction members arranged to engage a bag adjacent one end of its mouth and pivotally mounted so as to be rockable apart to open the mouth of the bag, and opposed auxilliary suction members rockably mounted about the pivot axes of the main suction members and arrange to engage the bag adjacent its mouth at positions spaced from said main suction members, said auxilliary suction members being rockable apart together with the main suction members to assist opening of the bag mouth. With this invention, when the suction members are moved apart so as to open the bag mouth, they form the open mouth into a generally oval configuration which facilitates placing of the mouth over the discharge spout of the filling machine. A bag applying machine embodying this invention may include a suction pick i p device arranged to lift the bag from a stack of flp bags and turn the bag from the horizontal position, in which it is removed from the stack, to a substantially vertical position with its mouth disposed along one vertical side edge of the bag.The transfer device is arranged to engage the bag held by the pick up device in this substantially vertical position and advance the bag from the pick up device for placement over the discharge spout of the filling machine. Preferably the pick up device is reciprocable substantially vertically for lifting the bag from the stack and includes suction means for gripping the bag which is rockable abort a substantially horizontal axis so as to turn the bag into the vertical position preparatory to engagement by the transfer device. With such a pick up device, when the bag has been gripped by the transfer device and released by the pick up suction means, the pick up device can immediately commence its next cycle and travel downwardly to lift a succeeding bag from the stack, thereby enabling the speed of operation of the machine to be increased.The pick up device may be reciprocable along a path disposed to one side of the vertical plane of movement of the transfer device and the pick up suction means may be arranged to turn the bag substantially into said plane of movement so as to permit the bag to be engaged by the transfer device. The speed of operation of the bag applying machine may be further increased by arranging two such pick up devices on opposite sides of the plane of movement of the transfer device, the two pick up devices operating alternately to lift bags from two stacks for successive feeding to the transfer device. The source of suction for the pick up and transfer devices is preferably a blower unit, such as a sidechannel blower, which produces a high degree cf suction and a high volume flow of air. This is preferred to a vacuum pump hich pr faces a higher degree of vacuum but a lower volume air flow because the latter is unable to compensate for small leaks which may occur in the suction system. The suction may be applied to the devices via ductomprising or extending through hollow casings forming the machine frame. The stack of bags may be contained in a fixed magazine on the machine, which magazine can be refilled by hand. Alternatively, stacks of bags may be loaded onto trolleys which can be wheeled into a position beneath the pick up device and can be changed when necessary.In a further alternative, the machine is fed with stacks of bags by a pneumatic system operating a magazine supply to the machine. This system is arranged to slide an empty magazine from under the pick up device and feed a loaded magazine onto the machine in its place, The empty magazine is then clear of the machine for refilling whilst the machine is removing bags from the loaded magazine. Moreover, such a pneumatic system permits the use of several magazines loaded with different size bags and the system can be selectively operated to load the machine with a magazine containing the size of bag required for filling.Brief Description of the Drawings In order that the present invention may be more readily understood, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings,in which Figure 1 is a side elevation of one embodiment of the invention and adjacent parts of a bag filling machine, Figure 2 is an end elevation of the bag applying machine from the direction of the arrow A in Figure 1, Figure 3 is a plar view of the bag applying machine shown in Figure 1, Figure 4 is a perspective view illustrating details of the main suction members, Figure 5 is a fragmentary view of the transfer device illustrating details of the coupling between a main suction member and the arm supporting the associated auxilliary suction member, Figure 6 is an end elevation with walls of the machine casings broken away to illustrate the interiors of the casings, and Figure 7 is a fragmentary side elevation with the adjacent casing wall broken away to show further details of the interior of the casing.Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment Referring to Figures 1, 2 and 3 of the drawings, the bag applying machine comprises a frame coneisting of two upright casings 1, 2 disposed side by side in spaced relation and interconnected at their upper ends by a hollow bridge part 3. A horizontal support casing 4 projects from the foot of the upright casing 2.These casings may be prefabricated from sheet metal. Secured to the casing 2 adjacent its upper end and projecting outwardly above the support casing 4 is a flat suction tank 5 which supports a suction pick up device 6 for removing bags from a stack of flat bags 7 disposed one on top of another and, in this case, carried on a trolley 8. This trolley has largo castors 9 which permit casy movement of the trolley over rough floor areas as the trolley is wheeled to the machine. The trolley is adapted to straddle the hollow support casing 4 which guides the trolley into the correct os ition under the pick device 6. The trolley includes small internal lfheels , schematically illustrated inFigure 6, which assist in accurately guiding the trolley onto the support casing.Moreover, small additional wheels not shown on the underneath of the trolley ride up the inclined leading edge 11 of the support casing 4, lift the larger running castors 9 off the floor and level the trolley at the correct height for removal of bags from the stack. The pick up device 6 comprises a pick up box 12 which is reciprocated vertically by means of a pneumatic cylinder and piston unit 13 mounted within the suction tank 5 and having its piston rod 14 connected to the pick up box. The latter is guided by two hollow guide rods 15 which are secured to the box 12 and are slidable in sleeves 16 secured to the inside of the bottom of the suction tank. At their lower ends, the internal bores of the guide rods are in communication with the interior of the box 12 whilst at their upper ends they open into the suction tank 5. Mounted at opposite ends of the pick up box 12 so as to be rockable about horizontal axes, are two elongated pick up suction members or fingers 17. These pick up fingers are more fully illustrated in Figure 4.Each finger is of hollow box like construction and is of somewhat triangular shape in elevation. A hollow pivot shaft 18 is secured to the finger adjacent its wider end and its bore communicates with the interior of the hollow finger. The finger has a planar suction face defined by a grill 19 having slots 20 communicating with the interior of the finger. The suction face is provided with an elastomeric sealing element 21, conveniently a soft rubber sealing element, which projects proud of the suction face. In operation, the suction draws the fabric of a bag against the rubber sealing element, and this provides friction to hold the bag in place whilst it is bei manoeuvred by the suction finger. As illustrated in Figures 1, 2 and 3, the hollow pivot shaft 18 of each suction finger is Journalled in the adjacent end of the pick up box 12 and connects the interior of the box with the interior of the associated suction finger so that suction applied to the tank is also applied to the fingers 17 via the hollow rods 15 and the pick up box. The suction fingers are actuated by individual pneumatic cylinder and piston units 22 mounted within the pick up box 12 and connected to crank arms 23 fixed to the pivot shafts 18 of the fingers. The pneumatic units 22 are operable in unison in order to rock the fingers between two positions in which the suction faces 19 of the fingers are respectively horizontal and vertical see Figure 2 .Hence, with the pick up fingers rocked into the positions in which the suction faces are horizontal, the pick up device can be lowered so as to engage the fingers with the top bag on the stack 7. The lowermost position of the pick up device is illustrated in broken lines inFigures 1 and 2 . The top bag is attached to the fingers by the application of suction, via the suction tank 5, and can be lifted from the stack, upon upward travel of the pick up device, and turned from the horizontal position in which it is removed from the stack into a vertical position by rocking the suction fingers 17 into the positions in which the suction faces 19 are vertical, as the pick up device is raised to its uppermost position full lines in Figures 1 and 2. In this position, the bag hangs from the fingers in a sub stantially vertical plane or position with its mouth at the side edge of the bag adjacent the upright casings 1, 2. The bag lifted and turned by the pick up device 6 is carried to the discharge spout 24 of the bag filling machine 25 by a suction transfer device 26. The latter comprises a swinging ar 27 suspended between the upright casings 1 and 2 X d having trunnions 28 journalled in these upright casings. The swinging arm is a bifurcated member and has opposed suction operated, bag holdln6 means 20 mounted at the lover ends of its limbs 30 for engaging, adjacent its mouth, a bag lifted by the pick up device, and for transferring the bag from the pick up device to the spout 24.During this transfer step, the suction means 29 are moved apart, as will hereinafter be described, to open the mouth of the bag and the swinging arm swings the bag into an upright position with its mouth uppermost for placing over the filling spout. Each suction means 29 includes an elongated suction member in the form of a suction finger 31 identical to the suction fingers 17 and having its hollow pivot shaft 32 journalled in the lower end of the associated limb 30 of the swinging arm. The two suction fingers 31 carried by the limbs 30 are disposed with their suction faces in opposed relation and are arranged so that when the suction means are fully closed together with no bag therebetween, the suction faces of the fingers are mutually parallel and in contact, via their rubber sealing elements.Freely pivoted on the pivot shaft 32 of each finger 31 is a spring biassed arm 33 which projects forwardly of the associated finger and has an auxilliary suction member in the form of a suction box 34 rockably mounted at its free end in spaced relation with the assoicated suction finger. The suction boxes 34 are mutually opposed and of similar construction to the suction fingers. When the suction means 29 fully close together without a bag therebetween, the suction faces of the boxes 34 are in contact via their rubber sealing elements. Each arm 33 is coupled to its associated suction finger 31, so as to be rockable therewith over a predetermined ar of movement, via a lost motion coupling. As illustrated in Figure 5, the latter comprises a pair of abutments 36, 37 projocting in spaced relation from the suction finger 31 adJacent its pivot shaft and arranged alternatively to engage a small roller 38 mounted on the arm 33 between the abutments.The arm is biassed towards a central position by leaf springs 39 fastened to the arm and engaged between three rollers 40 mounted on the associated limb 30 of the swinging arm. The arrangement is such that each abutment 36 engages the adjacent roller 38, when the suction fingers 31 are rocked towards the closed position, in order positively to close together the suction boxes 34, and each abutment 37 engages the adjacent roller 38 upon opening of the suction fingers in order positively to drive the suction boxes to an open position during the final arc of opening movement of the suction fingers.Intermediate these two stages, there is a position where the suction fingers move independently of the arms 33, and hence the suction boxes, which are thereupon resiliently controlled by the leaf springs 39. Suction is applied to the suction fingers 31 and boxes 34 via the swinging arm 27 which is of hollow construction The pivot shafts 32 of the suction fingers are in communication with the hollow interiors of the associated limbs 30 of the swinging arm, whilst the suction boxes 34 are connected to these limbs via pipes 42 fastened by suitable couplings to the ends of hollow pivot shafts 43 of the suction boxes, which shafts are journalled in collars 44 at the free ends of the supporting arms 33. The rocking movement of the suction fingers 31, and hence the suction boxes 34, is controlled by a pneumatic cylinder assembly mounted in the upright casing 2. Referring to Figures 6 ani 7, this assembly comprises a pair of pneumatic cylinder and piston units 46, 47 mounted side by side and having their piston rods interconnected by a yoke member 48 which is pivoted to each piston rod. The centre of the yoke member 48 is connected to crank arms 49 fixed to the pivot shafts 32 of suction fingers 31 by two rods or cables, in this case Bowden cables 50, extending through the adjacent trunnion 28 of the swinging arm and the hollow limbs 30 of the arm. This assembly moves the suction fingers 31 in unison. When the pistons of both units 46, 47 are fully retracted the suction fingers and boxes are fully closed together. XJhen both pistons are fully extended, the suction boxes and fingers are in their fully open position. When either one or other piston is extended and the other is retracted, the suction fingers and boxes are in a halt open position. The latter position permits the suction assemblies 29 to pass between the guide boards 48 of the conveyer mechanism 49 associated with the filling spout, during the return stroke of the swinging arm. The swinging arm 27 is moved between predetermined stations over its arc of movement by means of three pneumatic cylinder and piston units 50, 51, 52 connected in series Figure 7 . These are mounted within the upright casing 2 and are connected between the casing and a crank arm 53 secured to the adjacent trunnion 28 of the swinging arm. The three series connected pneumatic units 50, 51, 52 are actuated in a predetermined sequence to rock the swinging arm through the following stations during each transfer cycle. At the start of the said transfer cycle, the arm is rocked to a ccllecting station 54, at which it engages a bag carried by the pick up device 6.The arm is then advanced to a ready station 56, at which the suction means 29 are folly opened to open the mouth of the bag preparstory to placing it over the filling spout 24, and subseque tly to a bag clamping station 57, at which the bag mouth is placed over and clamped to the filling spout. At this latter station, the pneumatic units 50, 51, 52 are fully retracted, as illustrated in Figure 7. During the return stroke of the swinging arm, the pneumatic units rock the swinging arm from the bag clamping station back to the ready station 56, during which period the suction means 29 are half closed together, and thereafter to a nearvertical, rest station 55 in which the swinging as is stopped preparatory to commencing the next transfer cycle. The source of suction for the machine is a side channel blower 58, which is connected by a duct 59 to a cleaning box 60 mounted within the upright casing part 2. The cleaning box 60 has a removable bottom not shown so as to allow for removal of dirt sucked into the system through both sets of suction means and deposited in the cleaning box. The suction tank 5 is connected to the cleaning box 60 by a duct 61 extending through the upright casing 2. A duct 62 es tending through the upright casing 2, the hollow bridge part 3 and coupled to the hollow trunnion 28 within the casing part 1 connects the interior of the hollow swinging arm 27, and hence the suction means 29 to the cleaning box. Both ducts 61, 62 are connected to the cleaning box via valves 63, 64, respectively. The electrical and pneumatic control systems 66, 67, respectively, for the machine are mounted within the upright casing 1 and comprise plug in modules so that the electrical control relays 68 and the pneumatic valves 69 controlling the supply of air pressure to the various pneumatic cylinders can be readily changed by merely unplugging a defective component and replacing it with a new componen . The pneumatic control module is connected to a rr .rt ic junction box 70 having plug in connections for the pneumatic pipes 71 connecting the module to the pneumatic cylinders. Under the control of. the electrical and pneumatic systems, the sequence of operations of the machine is as follows. Upon switching on the electrical mains supply to the machine, the blower 58 is started and the following sequence of operations occurs a the air valves 63, 64 are opened, b the swinging arm 27 is positioned in its rest station 55 lrith the suction holding means 29 in the half open position, c the pick up device 6 travels to its uppermost position and the suction pick up fingers 17 are positioned horizontally. A trolley 8 loaded with a stack of paper or plastics bags to be filled is moved onto the support casing 4, the mouths of the bags being adjacent the upright casings 1, 2. A microswitch is located in a suitable position on the casings to detect the presence of a stack of bags in position on the machine and, if absent, prohibits the machine from operating.With the stack of bags in position, the operator initiates automatic operation of the machine by depressing a cycle start switch, whereupon the air valves 63, 64 are closed and air pressure is applied to the pneumatic cylinder 13 so as to drive the pick up box 12 doaiwardly until a microswiteh on the bottom of the box touches the top bag of the stack loaded onto the machine. Jben this bottom microswitch is actuated, the following sequence of operations occurs a the air valve 63 is opened to apply suction to the suction fingers 17, via the suction tank 5 and the guide rods 15, so that the top bag is gripped to the suction fingers, b air pres ure is applied to the cylinder 13 to raise the suction ox 12 together with the bag gripped thereto, c air pressure is applied to the pneumatic cylinders 22 so that the fingers and the bag are turned into the vertical position as the suction box travels upwardly. When the suction box 12 reaches its uppermost position, the bag has been turned into a vertical position or plane with its mouth disposed along the end or side edge of the bag adjacent the upright casings. A microswitch on top of the box is then actuated and this checks with a suction switch within the suction box to detect that a bag is in place. In the affirmative, these two switches provide a signal to initiate move nent of the swinging arm 27 to the collecting station 54.The swinging arm is rocked into the collecting station by actuation of one or more of the pneumatic cylinders 50, 51, 52 and, at the same time, the suction holding means 29 are rocked into their fully open position. In the collecting station, a first microswitch associated with the swinging arm trunnions 28 is actuated to cause air pressure to be applied to the cylinders 46, 47 so as fully to retract their piston rods and cause the suction means 29 to close together and grip the bag adjacent its mouth. The suction fingers 31 grip the bag held by the pick up device over an extended zone adjacent the upper end of the bag mouth, whilst the suction boxes 34 grip the bag adjacent the lower end of the mouth.Thereupon, a first microswitch associated with one of the suction fingers 31 is actuated which initiates the following sequence of operations a the air valve 64 is opened so as to apply suction to the suction means 29, b the air valve 63 is closed so as to shutoff suction to the pick up device and cause the latter to release the bag, c the pneuir tic cylinders 50, 51, 52 are actuated to commence t forward stroke of the swinging arm, d the pneumatic cylinders 22 are actuated so as to turn the suction pick up fingers 17 into their horizontal positions and the cylinder 13 is actuated so as to commence downward travel of the pick up device for picking up the next bag on the stack. The above sequence of operations will only be initiated in response to actuation of the first microswitch associated with the fingers 31 after a predetermined time delay controlled by the electrical control system, which time delay is sufficient to permit the preceding full bag to be moved away from beneath the discharge spout after the bag clamps have released the bag onto the conveyer mechanism 49. The swinging arm 27 with the bag gripped between the suction means 29 is now rocked by actuation of the pneumatic cylinders 50, 51, 52 into the ready station 56, this movement swinging the bag towards an upright position with its mouth uppermost. A second microswitch associated with the swinging arm trunnions 28 detects when the swinging arm is at the ready station and is connected in series with a suction switch responsive to suction within the swinging arm to detect that a bag is carried by the suction means at this station.In the affirmative, the pneumatic cylinders 46, 47 are actuated so as to extend their piston rods and fully open the suction means 29, thereby to form the mouth of the bag into a generally oval shape for placing over the spout see Figure 3, and a second microswitcb associated with thc suction fingers 31 actuates the pneumatic cylinders 50, 51, 52 to complete the forward stroke of the swinging arm and place the open mouth of the bag over the discharge spout 24. Movement of the swinging arm into the bag clamp ng station 57 actuates a third microswitch associated with the swinging arm trunnions which signals the exiting bag clamp electrical circuit to close the bag clamp and grip the bag to the discharge spout.Closure of the bag clamp is detectcd by a microswitch on the spout and when this microswitch is actuated to indicate that the bag is clamped to the spout, the following sequence of operations occurs a the air valve 64 is closed to sllut off suction to the swinging arm, b the pneumatic cylinders 50, 51, 52 are actuated to return the swinging arm to the rest station 55, c as the swinging arm commences its return stroke, one of the pneumatic cylinders 46 or 47 is actuated in order to half close the suction asscmblies 29 so that they freely move between the guide boards 48 of the conveyer, d a fourth microswitch associated with the swinging arm trunnions and connected in the weighing circuit of the bag filling machine prevents commencement of the bag filling operation until the swinging arm has moved away from the bag. The swinging arm 27 is retained at rest n station 55 until the top microswitch on the suction box 12 again detects that the pick up device has returned to its uppermost position carrying a fresh bag, whereupon the cycle of operations is automatically repeated, and so on until the stack of bags has been used up or the machine is prematurely stopped by actuation of a sultable F itch. Whilst a particular embodiment has been described, it will be understood that various modifications can be mauve witho jt departing from the scope of the in ien tion as defined by the appended claims. For example, in order o increase trn ,oeed of operation of the machine second suction tand nd pick up device may be mcunted on the upright casing 1 parallel to the suction tank 5 and pick up device 6. This second pick up device is arranged to pick up bags from a stack contained on a trolley or magazine disposed beneath it and successively feed these bags to the transfer device 26 in alternate relation to the first pick up device 6.
