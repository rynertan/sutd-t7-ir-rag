# Process for the production of polycarbonate.

## Abstract
A process for producing polycarbonate is described, comprising reacting a chloroformate group containing poly carbonate oligomer with an aqueous alkaline solution of a compound containing at least three functional groups and, thereafter, interfacial polycondensing the aboveobtained reaction product with an aqueous alkaline solution of a dihydric phenol compound. The thus produced polycar bonate has good melt characteristics compared with con ventional polycarbonates, and the dependence of melt vis cosity on a rate of shear is large. Thus, the polycarbonate of the invention is suitable for extrusion molding, particular ly for blow molding using an extrusion molding machine, and can provide good quality sheets or molds.
