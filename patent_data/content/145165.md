# Process for improving mechanical properties of epoxy resins by addition of cobalt ions.

## Abstract
A resin product useful as an adhesive, composite or casting resin and the process for preparing same to improve the flexural strength mechanical property characteristics thereof. This improved flexural strength is attained with little or no change in density, thermal stability or moisture resistance by chemically incorporating 1.2 to 10.6 by weight Co III ions in an epoxidized resin system.
