# Forced air gas burner and baking oven incorporating same.

## Abstract
A ribbon gas burner 28, 30 for use in a baking oven 10 has a row of gas apertures disposed between two rows of air apertures 68, 70 through which air is forced under pressure. The streams of air issuing from the two rows of air apertures 68, 70 are inclined inwardly towards the gas stream, thereby lengthening the ribbon flame 36, 38 produced by the burner 28, 30 and improving the uniformity of heating within the band oven.
