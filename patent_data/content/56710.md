# RECOVERY OF ENERGY FROM WASTE GAS STREAMS

## Abstract
In an iron or steel making plant comprising a metallur gical processing vessel 1 from which, in operation of the plant, there issues a stream of waste gas at superatmospher ic pressure and elevated temperature, there is provided means for recovering energy from the waste gas stream. This energy recovering means comprises means 6, 12 for supplying the gas stream to the inlet of a gas expander 16 which includes a rotor 18 drivable by the gas stream and comprising an output drive shaft 22 , an alternating current generator 28 arranged to be driven by the shaft 22 , and a voltage and frequency converter 32 having its input side connected to the electrical output of the generator 28 and its output side connected to an electrical power network 5 . The converter 32 is of the kind which, over a predetermined range of the speed of rotation of the generator 28 , delivers at its output side electric power at a voltage and frequency which at all times conform to the voltage and frequency of the network 5 .
