# SPLIT TANK ASSEMBLY WITH REINFORCEMENT IN THE REGION OF A JOINT

## Abstract
There are dislcosed a split tank assembly with reinforce ment in the region of a joint, and a method of making such a reinforced split tank assembly. Of particular interest is the possibility of releasably coupling tank sections 11 and 12 formed, for instance, by transversely splitting a bag moulded, reinforced tank. The assembly includes external circumferen tial clamping flanges 13 and 14 which are conveniently pro vided by level winding a relatively narrow band of resin impregnated filaments on the sidewall of the pressure vessel adjacent the midsection of the vessel. The resin in the fila ments is cured and the band and vessel are cut into a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the vessel so that band parts 13 and 14 are provided adjacent each open mouth of the resulting tank sections 11 and 12 and those band parts constitute the aforementioned clamping flanges. A circumfe rential, outwardly facing recess 18 is machined in a one band part 13 and an O ring groove 19 is machined in that outwardly facing recess 18. A circumferential, inwardly facing recess 22 is machined in the other band part 14 and an O ring 28 is provided in the O ring groove 19. The band parts 13 and 14 are telescoped together to form a pressure vessel with the O ring 28 pressed between the recesses 18 and 22. The band parts are clamped together by clamps 23 to form the assembly. The arrangement described above provides in an uncomplicated manner a means of providing reinforcement in the zones in which clamping is to occur.
