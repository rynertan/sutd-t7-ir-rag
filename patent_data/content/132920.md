## Description
MONOAZO DYE This invention relates to monoazo dyes and in particular to such dyes containing a sulpho isothiazole residue. Azo dyes derived from the use of heterocyclic amines as diazo components are well known e.g. dyes from aminobenzthiazoles and the dyes from amino isothiazoles which are described in US 4282144. We have discovered a valuable class of novel dyes containing a sulpho isothiazole residue. According to the present invention there are provided water soluble monoazo dyes which, in the free acid form, are of the formula EMI1.1 wherein E represents the residue of a coupling component of the arylamine series free from sulphonic acid groups. A preferred class of dyes is those in which E is the residue of a phenylamine or naphthylamine coupling component. A particularly preferred class of the dyes of the invention comprises dyes of the formula EMI1.2 1 2 wherein R1 represents hydrogen or optionally substituted alkyl, R2 represents hydrogen, optionally substituted alkyl, optionally 3 substituted aryl or cycloalkyl, R3 represents hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy and K4 represents hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy or acylamino. The expressions lower alkyl and lower alkoxy used herein mean alkyl and alkoxy groups containing one to four carbon atoms. The optionally substituted alkyl radicals which may be represented independently by R1 and R2 are preferably optionally substituted lower alkyl radicals and as examples of such radicals there may be mentioned hydroxy lower alkyl, for example beta hydroxyethyl, beta or gamma hydroxypropyi and delta hydroxybutyl, lower alkoxy lower alkyl, for example beta methoxyethyl, beta ethoxyethyl and gammamethoxypropyl, aryloxy lower alkyl, for example beta phenoxyethyl, cyano lower alkyl, for example cyanoethyl, aryl lower alkyl, for example benzyl, chlorobenzyl and beta phenylethyl, acyloxy lower alkyl, for example beta acetoxyethyl and beta benzoyloxyethyl, alkoxycarbonyl lower alkyl, for example beta methoxycarbonylethyl, lower alkoxy lower alkoxy carbonyl lower alkyl, for example beta beta methoxyethoxy carbonyl ethyl and chloro lower alkyl, for example gamma chloropropyl. 4 Acylamino groups which may be represented by K include, in 6 5 particular, groups of the formulae NHCOR5 and SHSO2R6 wherein R5 represents hydrogen, alkyl especially lower alkyl , aryl or aminoalkyl and R6 represents optionally substituted lower alkyl or aryl. The dyes of the invention may be manufactured by a process which comprises coupling the diazonium salt from 5 amino 3 methyl isothiazole 4 sulphonic acid with an arylamine coupling component free of sulphonic acid groups. The 5 amino 3 methylisothiazole 4 sulphonic acid may be obtained by the method described in J.Chem.Soc., 1965, pages 7283 and 7284. An alternative method is to effect ring closure on beta iminothiobutyramide forming 5 amino 3 methylisothiazole which may be converted to the 5 formylamino compound which may be sulphonated in the 4 position. Hydrolysis of the formylamino group provides 5 amino 3 methylisothiazole 4 sulphonic acid. Examples of suitable arylamine coupling components include l naphthylamineN,N diethyl l naphthylamineN,N diethylaniline N, N diethyl m toluidine N benzylanilineN o chlorobenzyl anilineN benzyl m toluidine N.

Similarly, the dyes may be isolated by known methods and, as in the case of other dyes containing sulphonic acid groups, it is often convenient to isolate and use the dyes in the form of their water soluble salts, particularly their alkali metal or ammonium salts and especially sodium salts.It is understood that the invention relates to both the free acids and their salts. The dyes of the invention are suitable for applying to polyamide textile materials such as wool and silk but especially to synthetic polyamide textile materials, for example nylon 66, nylon 6 and nylon 11, using any of the general methods known for the application of acid dyes to such materials. The dyes provide a variety of shades having a high degree of fastness to wet treatments and to light. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples.Examples 1 7 1.6g of sodium nitrite were added to 20 parts of 98X sulphuric acid allowing the exotherm to raise the temperature to 700 C. The solution was stirred until the temperature fell to 300C and was then further cooled to OOC. 4.28g of 5 amino 3 methylisothiazole 4sulphonic acid were then added over 15 minutes at OOC. The solution was then stirred for 1 hour at OOC. 2g of water were then added dropwise from a burette whilst maintaining the temperature below 50C. The diazo solution was then stirred for a further 10 minutes at OOC. The diazo solution was then added with stirring at OOC to a solution containing 5.5g of N benzyl N ethyl m toluidine in 75g of ice water and 100 parts of acetone. The pH was then raised to 3 4 by careful addition of 25 sodium acetate solution. A further 150g of ice and water were added and the suspension was stirred for a further 3 hours at OOC. The dyestuff in the form of the free sulphonic acid was then filtered off and washed with 150g of water. The product was converted to the sodium salt by treatment with sodium hydroxide. It dyes synthetic polyamide fibres from a weakly acidic dyebath in red shades. Further red dyestuffs were obtained when the above diazo component was reacted with the coupling components listed below in manner described above.
