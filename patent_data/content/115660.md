## Description
DESCRIPTION PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF ISOCYAMATES The present invention relates to the preparation of isocyanates or derivatives of isocyanates and more particularly to the preparation of isocyanates or derivatives thereof by direct carbonylation of organic nitro compounds. According to the present invention, a process for the preparation of isocyanates or derivatives thereof comprises reacting nitrobenzene or 2,4 dinitrotoluene with carbon monoxide, or a mixture of carbon monoxide and inert gas, in the presence of as catalyst, a polynuclear metal carbonyl or derivative thereof of the formula Mx CO yLz, n , wherein M Fe x 3 y 12 z 0 n 0 Fe x 3 y 11 z 1 L H n 1 Ru x 3 y 12 z 0 n 0 Ru x 3 y 11 z 1 L H n 1 Ru x 4 y 12 z 4 L H n 0 Rh x 6 y 16 z 0 n 0 Pt x 15 y 30 z O n 2 The reaction may be represented as follows ARNO 3CO RNCO 2CO 2 2 where R is phenyl or the residue of 2,4 dinitrotoluene. This reductive carbonylation reaction has two distinct advantages over the usual two step isocyanate synthesis based on the use of phosgene. First, it avoids the use of highly toxic phosgene and the formation of corrosive hydrochloric acid. Second, the hydrogenation step to convert the nitro compound to the corresponding amine derivative of the conventional process can be avoided, and the isocyanate is obtained in a single step. Although in the prior art there are examples of transition metal complex catalysed direct carbonylation of nitro compounds, the present process, which employs a novel class of metal complexes as catalysts, operates at a much reduced pressure with comparable yields and selectivity. The process involves reaction of the organic nitro compound with carbon monoxide, or a mixture of carbon monoxide and any other non oxidizing gas such as nitrogen or argon, in a suitable solvent in the presence of a catalyst. By carrying out the reaction in an alcohol the corresponding carbamate derivative can be obtained. This reaction of alcohols with isocyanates is well known. Alternatively, pure isocyanate may be synthesised by using very dry solvents that are inert to the isocyanate. The organic nitro compound can be nitrobenzene or 2,4 dinitrotoluene. Low conversions and poor selectivity are encountered with 2 ,4 dinitrotoluene.With nitrobenzene however the conversion and the selectivity are much higher. The pressure and temperature of the reaction influence the overall yield of the isocyanate derivative. Temperatures from 300C to 2000C and pressures from atmospheric 101 kPa to 5000 p.s.i. 34500 kPa have been used. The optimum pressure and temperature are about 100 ps.i. 689 kPa and 14000. The reaction can be conveniently carried out in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol or butanol or in an aromatic solvent such as benzene or toluene.Alternatively, the nitro compound itself can be used as a solvent. Tetrahydrofuran, alcohols and acetonitrile give better conversions and selectivities than the other solvents. The presence of water in the solvent causes the formation of amine and urea derivatives. Thus from nitro benzene, both aniline and diphenyl urea can be obtained in good yield by carrying out the direct carbonylation in wet tetrahydrofuran. The catalyst is a polynuclear metal carbonyl or derivative thereof of the following general formula M C0 yLz , whereM Fe x 3 y 12 z 0 n 0 Fe x 3 y 11 z 1 L H n 1 Ru x 3 y 12 z 0 n 0 Ru x 3 y 11 z 1 L H n 1 Ru x 4 y 12 z 4 L H n 0 Rh x 6 y 16 z O n O Pt x 15 y 30 z o n 2 For polynuclear metal carbonyl anions, i.e.cases where n 0, the counter ion is a tetra alkyl ammonium group. The catalytic activities of the polynuclear carbonyls vary widely and the ruthenium derivatives, especially Ru3 CO 12, are found to be the most active. With iron, platinum and rhodium derivatives, fairly rapid de activation of the catalyst takes place.It is also possible to use a precursor such as ruthenium trichloride trihydrate as the catalyst which under the reaction conditions is converted partially intoRu3 CO 12 The following Examples illustrate the invention. Example 1 In an autoclave 100 parts of tetrahydrofuran not dried and 100 parts of nitrobenzene were reacted with two parts of triruthenium dodecacarbonyl under an initial pressure of 100 p.s.i. 689 kPa of CO.
