# TIRE TREAD RUBBER COMPOSITION.

## Abstract
A tire tread rubber composition having improved grip ping, steering and low temperature characteristics, contain ing 15 to 50 parts by weight of a specific styrene butadiene rubber obtained by solution polymeration and having a macromolecular chain modified with a tri and or tetra functional binder, 50 to 85 parts by weight of at least one rubber selected from the group consisting of emulsion polymerized styrene butadiene rubber, natural rubber, synthetic polysoprene rubber, and butadiene rubber, at least one compound selected from the group consisting of sebacic esters, adipic esters, and fatty acid esters as plasticizer, and carbon black of 30 mÂµ or less in mean particle size.
