# Apparatus for providing a controlled power waveform.

## Abstract
A waveform synthesizer for generating single or poly phase waveforms of selected wave shape and frequency for driving AC machinery including, for example, single or poly phase induction, synchronous or other type motors or the like, includes a plurality of controllable power switching device pairs for selectively switching power from an oppositely poled DC source to the corresponding power utilizing circuits of the driven device. The switching device pairs are controlled to provide switched pulses of selected widths, spacings, and repetition rates to generate the desired current waveform. The power switching device pairs are selectively switched by a control circuit that includes a microprocessor controlled memory that is divided into P addressable pages with each page including S sequentially accessible memory locations containing the switching device pairs control information necessary to synthesize the desired waveform. The micro processor is adapted to select one of the P available pages in response to prestored instructions user input information, or condition responsive transducer or similar information and, after selecting the desired page P, to control a presettable address counter to sequentially access the S memory locations, of the selected page P at a selected access rate and to gate the so accessed switching information to the power switching device pairs to thereby synthesize the desired waveform.
