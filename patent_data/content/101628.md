# Pump station and mould parts and method of manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A pump housing, particularly meant for pumps of high yield and low lift, has a suction casing, a suction mouth and a volute arranged in the concrete substructure of a pump station. The volute is made by assembling thin walled mould wall parts, mounting them in place, and thereafter casting fresh concrete around the resulting mould wall, thereby ensuring that reinforcing elements of the mould wall are connected with reinforcing elements of the concrete to be cast. The suction casing and suction mouth are preferably made in the same way. Thus, the use of complicated casings for casting concrete elements can be avoided.
