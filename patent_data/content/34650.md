## Description
A METhOD FOR ATZoXYIATION OF AT,WANOLS This invention relates to the production of alkoxylated alcohols by reacting said alcohols in the presence of barium containing catalysts and promoters. More particularly, this invention relates to the production of alkoxylated alcohols by reacting said alcohols in the presence of these barium containing catalysts with adducting materials such as ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. The general reaction of alcohols and adducting materials such as ethylene oxide to form alkoxylated alcohols ethylene oxide adducts has long been known and practiced on a commercial scale. For example, ethylene oxide adducts have been used as detergents and cleaning agents, domestic and industrial laundry detergents, detergent. builders, polishers, sanitizers, and dry cleaning materials. Other users include the pulp and paper industry and the fiber industry. These materials are especially adapted to these uses since they have functional properties such as wetting power, foaming, emulsifying and dispersing abilities as well as solubilization and detergent abilities to facilitate their use. Much literature is available in the general area of ethoxylation of alcohols, biany references are also available relating to the catalytic ability of various materials and the mechanism and kinetics of these reactions. For example, French Patent 1,365,945 teaches the use of compounds containing an active hydrogen atom reacted with ethylene oxide in the presence of an alkali metal base. Acidic catalysts in general are also nowt. However, the ethoxylation of alcohols invariably produces a distribution of various adducts. For example on surfactant applications, an adduct of too few ethylene oxide molecules is not effective because of poor solubility. In contrast, an adduct with too many ethylene oxide molecules is likewise undesirable because of surface tension reduction per unit mass decreases drastically with increase in the molecular weight. Thus it has long been essential to produce and use ethoxylates with as sharp a distri bution in the desired mole adduct range 3 to 10 usually as possible. Acid catalyzed reactions produce such alkoxylates but these catalysts produce higher levels of some harmful side products such as dioxane which must be separated and removed prior to use. Russian Patent 523,074 teaches that alkali metals and various carbonates can be used to catalyze these reactions.The side product formation in the base catalyzed reactions is very low, but in base catalyzed reactions the adduct distribution is undesirably broad. The result is that a large proportion of the product obtained is not useful or is less desirable because of distribution. Representative of but not exhaustive of the art in this area is U.S. Patent 3,328,467 which describes the use of zeolites and modified zeolites as catalysts in ethoxylation reactions. French Patent 1,557,407 uses triethyl oxonium fluoroborate to catalyze such reactions.Indeed, the art abounds with references to alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium and potassium hydroxides, tertiary amines and sodium metal. German Offenlegungsschrift 2,639,564 teaches polyalkoxylation of active hydrogen compounds in the presence of a sodium fluoroborate or perchlorates of metal such as magnesium, calcium, manganese, or zinc. U.S.Patent 3,969,417 uses tertiary oxonium salts as a catalyst. U.S. Patent 3,830,850 describes adding sodium, potassium, lithium, rubidium, cesium, calcium, barium, or strontium to condense phenols with formaldehyde, then adding ethylene oxide to the condensation product in an ethoxylation reaction. However, all these materials have the disadvantages described and set forth above. Great benefit would be provided by a catalyst system which provides the low by product levels of base catalysts yet has the narrow distribution of the preferred mole adducts obtained from acid catalysts. Such a catalyst which would promote the narrowing of the product distribution curve would contribute significantly to the intrinsic value of the ethoxylate produced. Such a catalyst is described in U.S.application Serial Number 916,421, filed June 6, 1978. However, this catalyst has an induction period ranging up to about 20 minutes at 1780C and produces from 1 to 2 polyethylene glycol in the product which while small, is still undesirably large. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a catalyst system which will yield a narrow mole ado cut distribution from the reaction of alcohols of all classes with materials such as ethylene oxide and propylene oxide while providing low levels of undesirable by products and unreacted free alcohols, yet provide a reaction which is immediately effective with reduced induction period. Other objects will become apparent to those skilled in this art as the description proceeds. It has now been discovered according to the present invention that alkoxylation of alkanols containing from about 4 to about 36 carbon atoms can be carried out by contacting the alcohols with an alkoxylation agent in the presence of at least one material selected from the group consisting of barium hydride, barium oxide, barium hydroxide, hydrated barium hydroxide, or mixtures of these together with an effective amount of a catalyst promoter or mixture of catalyst promoters, wherein the alkoxylation reaction is carried out at temperatures of from about 1200C to about 2600C and wherein the catalyst promoter is selected from the group consisting of a polyols having a boiling point above 100 C and containing a total of 2 to 30 carbon atoms and having 2 or more hydroxyl containing groups of the general formulaEMI3.1 wherein R1, R2, and R3 are, independently, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, aryl groups, cyclic groups, or hydrogen and wherein theR designated groups can in addition contain one or more functional groups selected from the group consisting of ether, amine, carboxyl, halogen, carboxyl, nitro or amide b aldehydes and ketones having boiling points above 1000C and containing a total of from 2 to 3 carboo atoms, and having one or more carbonyl containing groups of the general formulaEMI4.1 wherein R1 and R2 are, independently, hydrogen, linear o branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, cyclic groups, or aryl groups and wherein the R designated groups can in addition contain one or more functionalities selected from the group consisting of carboxyl, hydroxyl, ether, halogen, nitro, amine, or amite, c primary, secondary or tertiary amides having a boiling point of above 1000C and containing a total of from 1 to 30 carbon atoms and containing 1 or more amide containing groups of the general formulaEMI4.2 wherein R1, R2, and R3 are, independently hydrogen, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, cyclic groups or aryl groups and wherein the R designated groups can in addition contain one or more other functionalities selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, ether, carboxyl, carbonyl, amine, nitro, r or halogen d primary, secondary or tertiary amines having a boiling point above 100 C, containing from a total of l to 30 carbon atoms and containing 1 or more amine containing groups of the general formulaEMI4.3 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are, independently, hydrogen, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, cyclic groups, or aryl groups, and wherein the R designated groups can in addition contain one or more functionalities selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, ether, carbonyl, halogen, carboxyl, nitro or amide e organic acids having a boiling point of above 100 C, containing from a total of 1 to 30 carbon atoms and having 1 or more carboxylic acid containing groups of the general formulaEMI5.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen, a linear or branched acyclic group, alicyclic group, cyclic group, or aryl group and wherein the R group can in addition contain one or more functionalities selected from the group consisting of carbonyl, hydroxy, halogen, ether, nitro, amine, or amide f phenols having a boiling point of above 100 C, containing a total of from 6 to 30 carbon atoms and having 1 or more functionalities of the general formulaEMI5.2 wherein R1, R21 R3, R4, and R5 are, independently hydrogen, halogen, hydroxyl, nitro, ether, or carbonyl, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, cyclic groups, aryl groups, or substituted aryl groups and wherein in addition the R designated groups can contain one or more functionalities selected from the group consisting of halogen, ether, nitro, carboxyl, carbonyl, amine, amide, or hydroxyl. Boiling points are measured at atmos pheric pressure, and may be proportionally higher or lower as pressure is altered. Barium hydride is an effective catalyst whether used alone or in combinatiol with a phenol or a substitute phenol c the formula described in f , where substitutions are, independently, hydrogen or alkyl groups containing fronu 1 to 10 carbon atoms. In our co pending application SN 36,273, filedMay 4, 1979, we described phenolic promoters having alkyl groups containing from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, In the present invention we have discovered that such acyclic and alicyclic groups containing at least 11 carbon atoms can also be used, in addition to or in combination with other functional groups described.

barium containing catalysts.Such alcohols are more acidic than normal alcohols such that the association constant is greater or the pKa is lower than normal alcohols. Thus, these alcohol promoters would have a pKa less than 17. These alcohols are those having the general formulaEMI11.1 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are, independently, hydrogen, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, aryl groups, or cyclic groups and wherein the R designated groups can in addition contain functional groups selected from the group consisting of halogen, nitro, carboxyl, amine, carbonyl, ether, and amide. The molecule can contain a total of from 2 to 30 carbon atoms. Representative examples of these effective alcohol promoters are triphenylmethanol trichloroethanol trifluoroethanol 2 nitroethanol 2 chloroethanol 2,2 dichloroethanol 2 methoxyethanol 2 chlorocyclohexanol ortho chlorobenzyl alcohol Thus, the instant invention describes a method forthe alkoxylation of alcohols comprising contacting said alcohols with an alkoxylating agent in the presence of barium containing catalysts together with an effective amount of a polyol, aldehyde, ketone, ermine, amide, carboxylic acid, substituted phenol or alcohol or mixtures of these to promote the reaction. Normally, the alkoxylation agent will be ethylene oxide or propylene oxide. The instant invention can be carried out at temperatures of from about 900C to about 2600C.Normally, the alcohols reactive under the process of the instant invention will contain from about 4 to about 36 carbon atoms but alcohols of from about 4 to about 24 carbon atoms are more common. Those alcohols containing from about 8 to about 18 carbon atoms are most used for cQ ivercial processes, The process of the instant invention can be carried out at ambient pressures. However, pressures of up to 100 pounds per square inch gauge psig can also be used.Pressures below about 60 psig are preferred. In addition, pressures below ambient can be used. It is clear that while pressure or lack of pressure is not a detriment to the process of the instant invention, it is simply more convenient to carry out the reaction in the pressure range of from about atmospheric to about 100 psig. The instant invention is normally carried out at temperatures of from about 120 to about 2600C. However, for practical purposes, commercial operations will normally be carried out in the temperature range of from about 150 to about 200 C. Temperatures in the range of from 1600C to about l900C are most preferred. Reactions can be carried out in the presence of any alkoxylation agent which produces a mole ad.luct ot tlrr sort desired. Normally such agents are alpha or beta alkylene oxides. In most commercial operations, either ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, or mixtures of these will be used to produce an adduct. Of these products, ethylene oxide is most preferred. Reaction products can have any desired content of alkoxylating agent such as ethylene oxide, but will normally range from about 30 to about 80 content of ethylene oxide EO based on weight. However, for most purposes, the content of ethylene oxide will range from about 40 to about 70 by weight. The amount of EO present in the reaction is not critical other than the minimum amount necessary to provide sufficient units to reach the mole adduct level desired for the alcohol being reacted. The barium containing catalyst of the present invention is a basic catalyst which provides a sharp distribution as to the mole adducts formed, while greatly reducing the amount of unreacted free alcohols and undesirable by products normally found in sharp distribution reactions.The instant invention adds to this barium catalyst an effective amount of phenol, acid, amine, aldehyde, polyol, ketone, amide or alcohol in order to further reduce byproduct reactions and to reduce or eliminate the induction period necessary for alkoxylation to begin. Representative examples of barium containing catalysts are barium metal, BaH2, BaO, Ba OH 2 and Ba OH 2. X H20 where X represents the number of water molecules present. These barium compounds alone are active in he process of the instant invention and are extremely active when used with an effective amount of a co catalyst or promoter. When used, these catalyst mixtures can be used in any desired quantity. The larger the quantity used, the more quickly the reaction goes to completion, although larger quantities do not appear to significantly alter the distribution obtained. However, for practical purposes, normally at least about 0.1 weight percent barium catalyst, based upon the weight of the alcohol to be reacted, would be present in the reaction. However, from 0.1 to about 5.0 weight percent is more commonly used and 0.1 to 2.0 weight percent is preferred. The amount et promoter catalyst which should be present witii the barium catalyst cllera11y an effective amount. The effect of the co catalyst or promoter becomes significant at about 0.1 by weight based upon the weight of the alcohol to be reacted.It is logical to expect an upper limit after which the amount of promoter present will produce no additional benefits. Normally, these materials will be added to the barium catalysts in amounts ranging from about 0.1 to about 2 by weight based upon the weight of the alcohol. Although amounts ranging from about 0.15 to about 1.5 are preferred, and amounts ranging from about 0.3 to about 0.8 by weight based upon the weight to be reacted is most preferred.However it is very apparent that these limits can be varied substantially. While the instant invention is effective with all classes of alkanols, including primary, secondary, tertiary, linear and branched, linear and branched primary alkanols are the most commonly used alcohols and are the preferred alcohols of the instant invention. Re resentative examples of such alcohols are those derived by hydrogenation of natural fats and oils, such as CO and TA alcohols, trademark of and sold by Proctor and Gamble Co., such as CO 1214N alcohol,CO 1618 alcohol, and TA 1618 alcohol, and ADOL alcohols, trademark of and sold by Ashland Oil Co., such as ADOL 54 alcohol, ADOL 61 alcohol, ADOL 64 alcohol, ADOL 60 alcohol and ADOL 66 alcohol. Alcohols produced by Ziegler chemistry can also be ethoxylated.Examples of these alcohols areALFOL alcohols, trademark of and sold by Conoco Inc, such as ALFOL 1012 alcohol, ALFOL 1214 alcohol, ALFOL 1412 alcohol,ALFOL 1618 alcohol, ALFOL 1620 alcohol and EPAL alcohols, trademark of and sold by Ethyl Chemical Co., such as EPAL 1012 alcohol, EPAL 1214 alcohol, EPAL 1418 alcohol. The invention is extremely useful for oxo alcohols hydroformylation produced from olefines.Examples of such alcohols are NEODOL alcohol, trademark of and sold by Shell Oil Co., such asNEODOL 23 alcohol, NEODOL 25 alcohol, NEODOL 45 alcohol TERGITOL L trademark of Union Carbide Corp., such as TERGITG L 125 alcohol LIAL alcohols, trademark of and sold by Lioci himica Co. such as LI.AL 1 d isodacy l and tri decyl alcohols, sold by Exxon Corp., such as isodecyl alcohol and tridecyl alcohol. Guerbet alcohols can also be ethoxylated.Representative examples of these alcohols are STANDAMUL alcohols trademark of and sold by Henkel Chemical Co., such as STANDAMULGT 12 alcohol, STANDAMUL GT 16 alcohol, STANDAMUL GT 20 alcohol, STANDPMUL GT 1620 alcohol. Secondary alcohols can also be used, such as TERGITOL 15 alcohol, trademark of and sold by Union Carbide Corp.

Generally, the treatment of alcohols with ethylene oxide yield a non ionic detergent since hydrogen bonding to the numerous oxygen atoms makes the polyether end of the molecule water soluble. Alternatively, the ethoxylates can be converted into sulfates and used in the form of alkali metal or ammonium salts. The instant invention provides for the production of highly efficient alcohol alkoxylates from primary, secondary and tertiary branched chain and straight chained alcohols in a novel highly unexpected m,anner. Of these, primary alkanols are preferred. These alkanols normally have from about 4 to about 20 carbon atoms, but from about 4 to about 36 carbon atoms can also be used. Reaction products are useful as non ionic surface active agents with high wetting power and are composed with mixtures of monoalkyl ethers of polyethylene glycol. Thus in the preferred form of the instant invention, ethylene oxide is reacted with a branched chain or straight chain higher alkanol in the presence of barium oxide, barium hydroxide, or other barium bases promote by an effective amount of gamines, amides, aldehydes, polyols, carboxylic acids, ketones, alcohols and substituted phenols. The invention is more concretely described with reference to the examples below wherein all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. The examples are provided to illustrate the instant invention and not to limit it. Example 1 All examples were carried out in a stainless steel reactor having a magnetic stirrer . This stainless steel reactor having the capacity of 600 cubic centimeters cc was charged with 120 grams of Neodol 25 alcohol trademark of and sold by Shell Chemical Co., a product of an hydroformylation reaction . Ba OH 2 H2O in an amount of 0.2 grams and 0.3 grams of 2 naphthol co catalyst or promoter was added. After purging with nitrogen at 250cc per minute for one hour at 1500C, the reactor was evacuated and the temperature raised to about 1750C. Ethylene oxide was then introduced to a total pressure of about 40 pounds per square inch gauge psig and ethylene oxide EO uptake of 180 grams was allowed to proceed at this pressure. After ethoxylation the catalyst was neutralized.The improved reaction rate achieved by the use of 2 naphthol as a promoter is shown in Figure 1, which directly compares the reaction rates of the two materials. The desired ethylene oxide distribution peak is shown in Figure 2. The reaction product was analyzed and found to contain a free alcohol content of 1.9 . Example 2 As a comparative example to Example 1, the Example 1 was repeated exactly except that no 2 naphthol was added as a promoter. Reaction time is set forth in Figure 1 at a comparative basis. An examination of the figure will clearly show the improved reaction rate to example 1 as compared to the present Example 2. Example 3 An experiment was carried out exactly as described in Example 1 except that 0.3 grams of 2 ethyl hexanoic acid was used as a catalyst promoter. The ethoxylation time was reduced from 185 minutes to 135 minutes because of the effectiveness of the promoter. The rate of ethoxylation is set forth in Figure 3. Example 4 An experiment was carried out exactly as described in Example 1 except that 0.27 grams of heptanoic acid was used. The ethoxylation time was reduced from 185 minutes to 150 minutes as a result of using heptanoic acid promoter.The reaction product was comparable in quality to that obtained using barium oxide alone. Example 5 A 600 cubic centimeter cc stainless steel reactor is charged with 120 grams of Alfol 1214 alcohol Trademark of and sold by Conoco Inc and a catalyst. The catalyst is Baths O R rai a Aster purgini ttt reactor with nitrogen at the rate of 500 cc s per minute for 3Q minutes at 1500C, the reactor is evacuated and the tcm perature raised to 1750C. Ethylene oxide EO is introduced to a total pressure of 40 pounds per square inch gauge psig and EO uptake at this constant pressure is measured as a function of time. After ethoxylation, the base is neutralized.The experiment will show that barium hydride is an extremely active catalyst. The catalysts and method of the present invention are extremely well suited for the alkoxylation of alcohols produced by olefins by hydroformylation or oxo hydrogen ation . Such alcohols have, in the past, presented difficulty when used as reactants for alkoxylatioh and particularly ethoxylation because of the high concentration of unreacted alcohols. The catalysts of the present invention produce extremely good ethoxylates using these alcohols. It is apparent that the instant invention provides a method for obtaining high mole adduct alkoxylates of alcohols having a very narrow, highly desirable distribution range. In addition, the products have low amounts of by products and unreacted free alcohols together with a desirably fast reaction rate. Promoters of the present invention greatly reduce the previously noted induction period present with these catalysts. Although exemplified as a batch reaction, the catalysts and promoters of the present invention are extremely well suited to continuous reaction methods. The reaction products are of extremely high quality and quantity. While certain embodiments and details have been shown for the purpose of illustrating this invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in this art that various changes and modifications may be made herein without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.
