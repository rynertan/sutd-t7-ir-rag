# Haulage drive chain for a mining machine.

## Abstract
A link component is adapted for interfitment with like link components to form a flexible chain free of hinge pins and cooperable with a drive sprocket. The link component has complementarily shaped end parts 10, 11 10 11 whereof each is the true or inverted image of the other. Each end part comprises a transverse recess 20 located between trans verse walls 21, 22 of which the longitudinally outer wall 22 is shorter than the inner wall 21 . The shorter end of the outer wall 22 and the recess 20 have complementary rounded for mations so that when the end part of one link 10 or 10 inter engages with the end part 11 or 11 of an adjacent link, the respective outer walls 22 locate in the corresponding recess 20 . Parallel side braces 12, 12 space the end parts 10, 11 10 11 apart through integration therewith and have external surfaces spaced laterally beyond the width of the end parts. A scraper chain conveyor comprises conveyor line pans 26 and a mining machine movable therealong, said pans hav ing elongate channel sections 13 in which a haulage linkage is located for engagement by drive sprocket means 35 on the machine, said haulage linkage comprising a plurality of link components as above defined, each component interfitting with adjacent components and being held captive in the chan nel section by flanges 14 of the channel section which over hang the spaced parallel side braces 12, 12 of the link com ponents.
