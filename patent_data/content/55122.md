# Fluid shear coupling apparatus.

## Abstract
A fluid shear coupling apparatus is disclosed herein which includes a driving member 11 received within a working chamber 24 defined by a driven member 22 . The driven member 22 is mounted with needle bearings 29 to a shaft 13 portion of the driving member 11 to have the members rotatable about a common axis 28 . The driving 11 and driven 22 members include complementary shaped and positioned fluid shear 16, 17, 25, 26 and thrust 19, 27 surfaces defining fluid shear and thrust chambers, respectively, therebetween and cooperable with shear fluid within the chamber 24 to transmit torque and axial thrust loads between the members. The fluid shear surfaces are defined by interdigitated ridges 16, 25 and grooves 17, 26 . A shear fluid reservoir 32 is located in the central portion of the driven member 22 and passageways 49, 50 lead from an annular groove 47 and cylindrical cavity adjacent the driving member back to the reservoir 32 . A recycle passageway 52 also leading from the annular groove and connects with the working chamber 24 at a radially inward location 53 to provide recirculation of shear fluid through the working chamber 24 . Several pro jections 56 and dams 61 are received within the cylindri cal cavity and annular groove 67 to provide shear surfaces for transmitting torque between the driving and driven members, and also to facilitate the pumping of the shear fluid from the working chamber 24 back to the reservoir 32 or through the recycle flow path. 51, 52, 53
