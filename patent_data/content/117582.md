# Current limiting high voltage fuse assembly.

## Abstract
A current limiting high voltage fuse comprises a prefer ably tubular support body 1 , consisting of quartz glass, and fusible conductors 2 attached over their entire length to the support body, which conductors 2 are of a width of minimum 0.5 mm and maximum 1 mm and of a thickness of maximum 50 micrometer. These fusible conductors are applied in parallel paths, the distance between the paths being at least twice as large as the width of the fusible conductors. Also the fusible con ductors are provided with narrow sections 4 separated in longitudinal direction of the fusible conductor over regular distances, and interconnected at both ends by an electri cally conducting sleeve 3 applied to the support body 1 .
