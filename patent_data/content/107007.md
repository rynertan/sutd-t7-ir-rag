# Sulfur vulcanizable blends of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer elastomers and polyacrylate elastomers.

## Abstract
Polyacrylate containing elastomers, having improved tensile strength and hardness upon vulcanization, comprise blends containing about 35 to 65 percent, by weight, of a sulfur vulcanizable graft elastomer having a major propor tion of ethyl acrylate and a minor proportion of an ethylenic ally unsaturated comonomer which contains a cure site for sulfur vulcanization, grafted onto an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, and about 65 to 35 percent, by weight, of a sulfur vulcanizable polyacrylate elastomer,
