# AMINO FORMALDEHYDE RESINS AND USE THEREOF IN LIGNOCELLULOSIC COMPOSITES

## Abstract
Conventional amino formaldehyde resins suffer from the serious disadvantage of excessive release of free formaldehyde. This invention provides an amino formal dehyde resin having a formaldehyde to amino compound mole ratio of 1.1 to 1.2 1 which contains essentially no free formaldehyde, and which when cured contains substantially more methylene groups than methylene ether groups and which has very low free formaldehyde release. The resin is prepared by a two stage process in which the first stage is conducted under acid conditions and the second stage un der neutral conditions. The resins are useful, inter alia, in the manufacture of wood compositions, especially particle board.
