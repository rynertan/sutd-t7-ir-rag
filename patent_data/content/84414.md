# SELF CONTAINED ARCADE GAME APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR OBJECT GENERATION

## Abstract
The apparatus includes a self contained video display and game apparatus, adapted for the display of objects consisting of connected line segments. A CRT is controlled by a controller unit adapted to convert digital representa tions of objects into a series of connected line segments drawn by the CRT. The controller is adapted to determine the position 0,1 of the object to be drawn, to move a positioning vector P1 from the center of the CRT to that location, and to draw the series of predetermined, connected line segments V1 V6 which comprise the object. Beam current may be turned off for the whole or part of any line segment.
