The term cation , as used throughout the specification, refers to any positively charged atom or group of atoms, The SO3 M substituent on the nitrogen atom of the B lactams of this invention encompasses all sulfonic acid salts.Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are, of course, preferred, although other salts are also useful in purifying the products of this invention or as intermediates for the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The cationic portion of the sulfonic acid salts of this invention can be obtained from either organic or inorganic bases. Such cationic portion includes, but is not limited to, the following ions ammonium substituted ammonium, such as alkylammonium e.g., tetra n butylammonium, referred to hereinafter as tetrabutylammonium alkali metal, such as lithium, sodium and potassium alkaline earth metal, such as calcium and magnesium pyridinium dicyclohexylammonium hydrabaminium benzathinium N methyl D glucaminium. As set forth in formula I, and in the definitions following formula I, my can be hydrogen.Such compounds are often referred to in the art as inner salts by virtue of a positive and negative charge in the molecule. This invention is directed to those B lactams which have been described above, wherein the stereochemistry at the chiral center in the 3 position of the S lactam nucleus is the same as the configuration at the carbon atom in the 6 position of naturally occurring penicillins e.g., penicillin G and as the confiquration at the carbon atom in the 7 position of naturally occurring cephamycins e.g., cephamycin C . The B lactams of formula I have activity against a range of gram negative and gram positive organisms. The compounds of this invention can be used as agents to combat bacterial infections including urinary tract infections and respiratory infections in mammalian species, such as domesticated animals e,g., dogs, cats, cows, horses, and the like and humans. For combating bacterial infections in mammals a compound of this invention can be administered to a mammal in need thereof in an amount of about 1.4 mg kg day to about 350 mg kg day, preferably about 14 mg kg day to about 100 mg kg day. All modes of administration which have been used in the past to deliver penicillins and cephalosporins to the site of the infection are also contemplated for use with the novel 6 lactams of this invention. Such methods of administration include oral, intravenous, intramuscular, and as a suppository. The compound of formula I can be prepared from an azetidine having the formulaEMI12.1 wherein A1 is a nitrogen protecting group, e.g., triphenylmethyl, and A2 is an alkyl or aryl group. Reaction of an azetidine of formulaII with a thiolate having the formulaEMI13.1 yields a mixture of diastereomers of the formulasEMI13.2 andSeparation of the above diastereomers can be accomplished using conventional chromatographic or fractional crystallization techniques. The addition of a sulfo SO3 group to the l position of a compound of formula IVa or IVb or the R methoxy counterpart yields the corresponding compound having the formulaEMI13.3 Introduction of the sulfo substituent can be accomplished, by sulfonation as for example by reacting a compound of formula IVa or Nb or the Rawthoxy counterpart with a complex of pyridine and sulfur trioxide. The reaction can be run in an organic solvent or in a mixture of organic solvents, preferably a mixture of a polar solvent such as dimethylformamide and a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane.This reaction yields a compound of formula V wherein M is pyridinium ion. Instead of using a pre formed complex of pyridine and sulfur trioxide, the complex can be formed in situ, e.g., using chlorosulfonyltrimethylsilyl ester and pyridine as reagents. Alternatively, a complex of dirnethylformamide sulfur trioxide, 2 picoline sulfur trioxide or 2,6 lutidine sulfur trioxide can be used. Using conventional techniques e.g., ion exchange resins, crystallization, or ion pair extraction the pyridinium salt formed by the above procedure can be converted to other salts. These techniques can also be used to convert the products of formula I, or any of the intermediates described herein, to other salts. A second method for introducinq the sulfo group to the l position of an azetidine of formula IVa or IVb comprises first silylating the compound and then subjecting the silated compound to a silyl interchange reaction.Exemplary silylating agents are monosilyltrifluoroacetamide, trimethylsilylchloride triethylamine, and bis trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide, and an exemplary reagent useful for the silyl interchange reaction is trimethylsilyl chloro sulfonate. Deprotection of an azetidine of formula V yields a zwitterion having the formulaEMI15.1 The deprotection techniques used are conventional, and will depend on the particular protecting group A1 present. Treatment with acid e.g., formic acid or trifluoroacetic acid cleaves a triphenylmethyl or a t butoxycarbonyl protect in9 group. Treatment with hydrogen fusing a catalyst such as palladium cleaves a benzyloxycarbonyl protecting group. Treatment with phosgene or phosphorous pentachloride cleaves an amide protecting group. The zwitterions of formula VI are novel intermediates, and as such, constitute an integral part of this invention. Conventional acylation techniques can be used to prepare the products of formula I wherein R is hydrogen from a zwitterion of formula VI. Exemplary acylation techniques include reaction with a carboxylic acid R 1 OH , or corresponding carboxylic acid halide or carboxylic acid anhydride. The reaction with a carboxylic acid proceeds most readily in the presence of a carbodiimide and a substance capable of forming an active ester in situ such as N hydroxybenzotriazole. In those instances when the acyl group R1 contains reactive functionality such as amino or carboxyl groups it may be necessary to first protect those functional groups, then carry out the acylation reaction, and finally deprotect the result ing product. Variations of the above described synthetic route some of which are described in the examples presented below will be apparent to the practitioner of this invention. For example, a compound of formula IVa or IVb can be deprotected and then protected with a different amino protecting group before proceeding with the remaining synthetic procedure. The B lactams of formula I wherein R is methoxy can be prepared from the corresponding compound of formula I wherein R is hydrogen. Elalogenation of the amide nitrogen of a non methoxylated compound of formula I yields, in situ, an intermediate having the formulaEMI16.1 Reaction of an intermediate of formula VII with a methoxylating agent, e.g., an alkali metal methoxide yields a product of formula I wherein R is methoxy. The reaction can be run in an organic solvent, e.g., a polar organic solvent such as dimethylformamide, at a reduced temperature. An alternative synthesis for preparing the compounds of formula I wherein R is methoxy comprises first alkoxylating a compound of formula IVa or IVb wherein A1NH is a carbamate e.g., A1 is benzyloxyearbonyl and then introducing a sulfo group in the l position of the resulting compound. Deprotection and acylation, using the procedures described above, yields the products of formula I whereinR is alkoxy. Alternative syntheses for the preparation of the products of this invention are available.For example, compounds of formula I wherein R4EMI17.1 can be used as intermediates to obtain corresponding products of formula I whereinEMI17.2 wherein R5 is alkoxy, aryloxy, arylalkoxy or ii EMI17.3 Standard coupling reactions are employed.
