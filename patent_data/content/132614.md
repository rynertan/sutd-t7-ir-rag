# A method for manufacturing an integrated circuit device.

## Abstract
An integrated circuit 14 having an active circuit 19 is formed on a circuit wafer 10 . A moat 18 in the field oxide 20 surrounds the active circuit 19 . Metallic conductor 30 passes from a location on the active circuit 19 over the moat 18 to a contact area 22 . The wafer 10 is covered with a photoshaped silicon nitride layer 18 , and a support wafer 40 is secured with adhesive 46 to the circuit side of the circuit wafer 10 . The circuit wafer 10 is photoshaped to expose the metallic conductor 30 at the contact area 22 , and the contact area 22 is prepared with multiple metal layers 62, 66, 70 for connection to external wiring.
