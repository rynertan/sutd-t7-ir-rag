## Description
This application relates to a pasteurization process and apparatus. Pasteurization has been used in the wine and brewing industry for many years having been developed around 1865 by Louis Pasteur. Pasteurization is the reduction of micro organisms by heating to a limited temperature and holding at that temperature such that there will be minimum effect on physical stability and flavor and a maximum extension of biological stability, thereby increasing shelf life. Although the present application describes the invention with reference to the pasteurization of beer, the invention also is applicable to all products which are pasteurized in a package, including soda and other soft drinks, fruit juices and drinks, and milk. The specific P.U. inputs and temperature and time will vary according to the product being treated. The various organisms in beer are not pathological and dangerous to humans, but affect the taste and apperance of the beer if allowed to grow. Draft beer generally is not pasteurized because it is kept refrigerated and is usually consumed in a short time. However, high quality can and bottle beer traditionally is pasteurized for long shelf life, and conventional type pasteurizers are shown in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,282,187 and 2,658,608. In this type pasteurizer, water is sprayed onto the tops of the closely packed packages which are moved through a tunnel which is divided into a series of preheat zones, a series of heating zones, a holding zone, and a series of cooling zones. The temperature of the beer in the containers is progressively raised to the desired level before being passed through the cooling zones where it reaches the desired beer out temperature BOT . The water running off the packages is collected in reservoirs, heated or cooled, and recycled to the sprays or spray pans. These types of tunnel pasteurizers are available in single and double deck configurations. The spray nozzles on the lower decks traditionally are difficult to maintain free from blockage, so the single deck conveyor has been the generally accepted norm in the brewing industry in the United States. If pasteurization causes the temperature of the beer to reach too high a level, certain tastes called pasteurization tastes can occur in the beer. These are undesirable and have been defined as bready , biscuity , burnt type tastes , papery or cardboardy . Also, insufficient pasteurization can result in turbidity of the beer or sedimentation. The organisms which cause the most difficulty in the brewing industry today are lactobacillus, pediococcus and wild yeast. These are not pathogenic organisms but can cause turbidity and poor taste in beer. In order to insure complete pasteurization of beer, the temperature of the beer at the so called cold spot which is 0.635 cm. 1 4 inch from the bottom of the center of the can or bottle must reach at least 60 C 140 F for a period of time to produce a specified number of pasteurization units P.U. . It also is desired to pasteurize at the lowest possible peak cold spot temperature above 60 C. 140 F to avoid overheating the rest of the package contents, because the temperature of the package gets higher as one goes from the cold spot to the top of the package. The P.U. is a measure of accumulated lethality. One P.U. for beer is one minute at 60 C. 140 F. . Lethality P.U. per minute is a rate term which is exponential with temperature. Lethality begins to become significant only when the beer temperature is 55.55 C to 57.22 C 132 F to 135 F and is most significant at 59.44 C 139 F and above, although P.U. accumulation begins at 48.88 C 120 F . Over the years different minimum P.U. have been stated as the requirement for pasteurizing beer, but it is clear that at least 5.6 P.U. are required and if numerous organisms are present, a standard of 8 P.U. has been set forth. Some breweries require a minimum of 10 P.U. as their standard. It has been determined that Conventionally, some pasteurizers have used spray densities as low as 138.52 l. min. m.² 3.4 gal. min. ft.² of tunnel surface area and have used spray heads aligned in a straight line running the length of the tunnel. Recent precise measurements of the spray pattern developed in such pasteurizers have shown a wide variance of water applied to the different cans or bottles across the width of the tunnel. Thus, the product will receive varying and insufficient water spray coverage, resulting in non uniform heating or cooling of the product. This in turn results in non uniform product pasteurization. It is desired to maintain a uniform P.U. input to the packages, i.e., a standard deviation of P.U. input of two or less. As used in the brewing industry in reference to P.U. input, the term, standard deviation, means that the P.U. input to all packages varies by only the stated amount. Thus a standard deviation of P.U. input of two or less indicates that the P.U. input to any package in the line varies by only 2 P.U. at the most. This is not the same meaning the term standard deviation has when used in the fields of statistics, probability, etc. The theory of transfer of heat from the water spray to the contents of the container is that the film resistance to transfer is greatest at the inside wall of the container and mixing in the container occurs through thermal conduction and convection currents generated as the contents are heated and circulated. The circulatory motion across the heat transfer surfaces reduces the internal surface film resistance and tends to bring the container contents to an equilibrium temperature. The so called cold spot in the container is stated to be 0.635 cm. 1 4 inch above the center of the bottom wall and is the last point to come to equilibrium temperature through these conduction and convection currents. It is necessary to raise the temperature of the cold spot to above 60 C 140 F , but is desirable to hold it as close to 60 C 140 F as possible to minimize taste changes caused by excess heating of the remainder of the container. The object of the present invention is to provide a pasteurization process in which there is very little deviation in P.U. applied to each package and in which heat transfer efficiency is maximized by applying a uniform amount of water to each package with increased intensity of water. The present invention provides an improved method for tunnel pasteurization of product in packages wherein water spray is applied to the tops of the packages to control P.U. input and wherein the P.U. input to each package is at a predetermined P.U. input level in a predetermined P.U. range characterized by The present invention provides the lowest practical product out temperature for the product leaving the pasteurizer. The present invention also provides an improved tunnel pasteurizer capable of pasteurizing beer in packages with a high degree of P.U. input control to each package and a low maximum cold spot beer temperature above 60 C The foregoing and other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent hereinafter. In the drawings wherein like numerals refer to like parts wherever they occur. Figure 1 shows a schematic arrangement of the pasteurizer apparatus which is typical of the type of pasteurizer construction to which this invention is directed. Directly below the pasteurizer apparatus are curves showing the spray temperature and beer temperatures on the top deck and the lower deck. The dashed line indicates the upper deck cold spot beer temperature, the solid line indicates the average beer temperature for the upper deck, and the dotted line indicates the lower deck cold spot temperature. The relationship among the upper deck and lower deck temperature, the spray temperatures and the times at each spray temperature will be discussed in greater detail hereinafter. The mechanical details of the operation of the pasteurizer can be varied according to the type of construction favored by any particular pasteurizer manufacturer. The pasteurizer 20 comprises a series of heating, holding and cooling zones identified by the numerals 1 through 10. There can be more than or fewer than 10 zones according to various limits of design parameters. Inside the pasteurizer 20 are top and bottom deck conveyor mechanisms 21 and 24 of any preferred conventional type, such as that known as a walking beam , on which the unpasteurized packages 22 to be pasteurized are placed in contacting arrangement. The packages in the beer pasteurizing operation are typically filled glass bottles or metal cans. Positioned above the top surfaces of the packages a distance of about 15.24 to 35.56cm 6 inches to 14 inches is a series of spray nozzles 23 which are connected by a header and a dedicated spray pump not shown associated with each zone. Also for certain of the zones, dedicated external heating and or cooling devices not shown are associated. In the context of this invention, the term dedicated means the pump is only for the headers in a particular pasteurizer zone. The illustrated pasteurizer 20 is shown as having a lower deck 24 packed with articles to be pasteurized, which deck 24 is positioned beneath the upper deck 21 and above the reservoir 25 at the bottom of each zone. This type pasteurizer is known as a tunnel pasteurizer and has an enclosed top 26, a bottom 27, side walls 28, and end walls 29 with an opening in the ends 29 through which the containers 22 pass into and out of the pasteurizing zones. Typically, the top 26 of the pasteurizer 20 is provided with suitable openings with covers to provide access to the interior of the pasteurizer 20 for maintenance, cleaning, testing of temperatures, etc. The lower deck 24 is optional and the pasteurizer is functional with only one deck. For many pasteurizers which are currently in use and which will be rebuilt to incorporate the features of this invention, only one deck is in place, and it is not practical to add a second deck. The lower deck 24 does double capacity with little, if any, increased operating cost and only a small increase in capital cost. Figure 2 shows schematically the arrangement of the nozzles 23 in the pasteurizer 20. The nozzles 23 are positioned on headers 23a which are positioned on 45.72 cm. to 60.96 cm. 18 inch to 24 inch centers running the length of the pasteurizer 20 from the infeed end to the outfeed end. As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the nozzles 23 extend in perpendicular arrangement from the headers H along the length of the pasteurizer 20. The nozzles 23 on any one header H are spaced 22.86 to 30.48cm. 9 inches to 12 inches longitudinally. At the interior of the pasteurizer 20, the nozzles 23 are ofset on 15.24cm. 6 inch transverse or lateral centers along the headers H . As noted, in the center section 23a the distance between longitudinally aligned nozzles 23 is between 22.86 to 30.48cm. 9 inches to 12 inches . However, at the pasteurizer sides 28, the nozzles are on 7.62cm. 3 inch transverse centers and are paired opposite each other along the headers. Figure 3 shows a drawing of the preferred nozzle 23 of the present invention which provides a circular hollow cone pattern and has a 0.952cm. 3 8 inch orifice opening. The pressure to the nozzles 23 is about 0.352 to 0.422 kg cm² 5 to 6 psig and the spray density is above about 244.45 L. min. m² 6 gal. min. ft.² of tunnel surface area so as to provide uniform water coverage to all of the containers. Preferably the spray density is above 285.19 L. min. m² 7 gal. min. ft.² and at certain locations in the tunnel is as much as about 366.68 l. min. m² 9 gal. min. ft.² . Previously many spray heads were recommended for operation at a spray density of 122.22 162.96 l. min. m² 3 4 gal. min. ft.² . This caused many containers to pass through the pasteurizer with wide fluctuations in P.U. input. A typical spray pattern at the top of the containers is illustrated in Figure 3 and the outside diameter is about 53.34 cm. 21 inches and the inside diameter is about 27.94cm. 11 inches . The spray pattern cones are substantially on the order of 80 transparent. This permits the simultaneous wetting of a package by the sprays from many nozzles, without the droplets hitting each other. At the ends of the zones identified in Figure 1 are deflectors D which keep the spray waters from one zone from carrying over to the next adjacent zone. These are conventional items attached to the spray heads 23. When spray water is applied to the top of a package, substantially all of the heat transfer is through the side walls of the container because there is a gas space immediately beneath the lid of the container which is an impediment to heat transfer. In conventional metal cans there is a hard plastic coating over the outside of the can to protect the finish during processing and this causes water to flow outside of the can in circuitous rivulets, which impairs the efficiency of heat transfer so that a larger volume of water flowing over the outside of the can will increase the effective surface area which is contacted by the water, thus increasing the efficiency of the heat transfer. A lower flow rate is permissible for bottles because the water spreads out more smoothly and uniformly over the bottle surface even though the glass has a lower overall co efficient of heat transfer. As hereinbefore briefly discussed, in a filled container there is what is defined as a cold spot , which is located 0.635cm. 1 4 inch above the bottom of the container at the center of the container. The temperature gradient of the contents of the container grows progressively hotter as one goes from the cold spot to the top of the container. In order to insure complete pasteurization of all of the contents within the package, it is necessary that the temperature of the cold spot reach 60 C. 140 F . As noted it is desirable to pasteurize at the lowest possible peak cold spot temperature therefore, it is desirable that the peak cold spot temperature be as close to 60 C 140 F but above it as possible. In the present invention we have been able to reduce the maximum temperature of the cold spot to 60 C. to 61.67 C. 140 F to 143 F and preferably at 60.55 C. 141 F. for a 0.55 C. 1 F. margin of safety. At the same time, the input of pasteurization units P.U. to the contents of each package is between 5.6 and 20 and preferably more than 10. As previously noted there is some difference of opinion as to the minimum P.U. needed to insure adequate pasteurization, but arbitrarily we have selected a standard of at least 10 as our preferred minimum. At the same time, in order to insure the greatest uniformity of P.U. input to each of the containers in the pasteurizer it is desirable that the standard deviation of P.U. input be no greater than about 2 and preferably less. It has been found in present pasteurizers that there is a standard deviation of P.U. input on the order of 4 8 and sometimes even greater. As hereinbefore noted, the term standard deviation as used in the beer industry and in this application means that all of the beer packages that go through the pasteurizer in a given run have P.U. input of 2 P.U. units of each other. Figure 4 shows a graph of lethality P.U. input per min. versus beer temperature, which is a logarithmic relationship and clearly shows that while accumulation starts at 48.88 C. 120 F. , P.U. input does not become significant until the beer temperature has reached the high 50 s to low 60 s. Table I shows in graph form the temperature v. lethality relationship. The longer holding time and the greater and more uniform spray water flows allows the P.U. input to a lower deck to nearly equal the P.U. input to the upper deck without overheating the upper deck because of the length of the second heating and holding zones. The function of the second heating zone is to bring the cold spot temperature to 60 C. to 60.55 C. 140 F to 141 F without using extremely hot spray water temperatures, i.e., not above about 65.55 C. 150 F . It is important that the spray water temperature to the second heating zone and the holding zone be controlled carefully to predetermined levels to keep the hot spot temperature of the package on the upper deck or the single deck as the case may be as low as possible to hold down internal container pressure. The maximum hot spot temperature closely approximates the spray temperature of the zone. The length of the second heating zone is determined such that the ratio of the initial to final temperature differences or thermal driving forces is equal to approximately 4.8 5.0. For purposes of this application these driving forces are defined as the differences between the spray temperature in the zone and the average product temperature on entering and on leaving the zone. Using this principal the difference in cold spot temperature at the upper and lower deck at the exit of the second heating zone will be less than 0.55 C. 1 F . The cold spot temperature is approximately 60.55 C. 141 F on the upper deck or on the single deck of a one deck pasteurizer. Since the first and second heating zones are calculated to contribute only about 3 P.U., the majority of the P.U. input occurs in the holding zone, where the cold spot temperatures of both decks are practically equal on entering the zone and are equal on leaving the zone. Therefore, if this ratio is high about 5 , a variation in product entering temperatures can be tolerated as the exit temperature difference is reduced to one fifth of the initial difference. Standardizing holding zone in temperature avoids significant variation in P.U. input to the packages because most P.U. input is in the holding zone. The mentioned high value of the ratio of the initial to the final temperature differences in the second heating zone and the resulting length of the second heating zone is a key factor in achieving uniformity in P.U. input to the packages on a single deck pasteurizer. In a double deck machine this is a critical factor in maintaining product temperatures on both decks within one degree of each other on entering the holding zone which results in only small P.U. input differences between packages on the upper and lower decks on leaving the holding zone. Another significant factor is the longer holding zone which permits the spray temperature of the lower deck to come to equilibrium with the spray temperature of the top deck at a level close to the desired product temperature and where the P.U. input rate is high. Another key factor is the regenerative effect of the first precool zone 6 and the first heat zone zone 3 in a double deck machine See Figure 1 . We purposely keep the spray temperatures of the first precool zone high approximately 56.66 C 135 F to take advantage of the increase in temperature of the spray as it passes over the upper deck to increase P.U. input to the lower deck and thus minimize the total P.U. difference between decks. This P.U. difference is caused by the lower deck spray temperature being less than the upper deck spray temperature entering the holding zone zone 5 . Accummulated P.U. is therefore less on the lower deck at this point. However, the packages on the lower deck pick up a significant part of the P.U. difference as they pass through the first precool zone zone 6 due to the increased spray water temperature effect previously described for the first precool zone. Another advantage of the high ratio value between initial and final temperature differences in the second heating zone is that the hot spot temperature is reduced from about 64.44 C. to 67.77 C. 148 F to 154 F or more to about 62.77 C 145 F or less. This is important because the internal pressure of the package is dependent on the hot spot temperature. With continued trends toward light weighting or thinner walled containers, reduced internal pressure becomes an important factor in container design. Figure 5 shows that a typical curve of beer temperature versus time in a pasteurizer in which the total P.U. input will fall between 10 and 17 P.U. The P.U. is the area beneath the curve and it is clear that the majority of accumulated P.U. is added when the beer temperature is above 60 C. 140 F as shown by the area between the broken lines. Figure 6 is a graph showing the relationship between spray density and heat transfer in kilo calories hr. per C BTU hr. per F , which indicates that the optimum spray density is about 366.68 L. min. m² 9 gal. min. ft.² and that further increases in spray density do not significantly increase the heat transfer rate and consequently do not significantly increase the P.U. input. Figure 7 shows a spray pattern diagram at spray pressure of 0.352 to 0.422 kg cm² 5 6 psig and 366.68 476.68 L. min. m² 9 11.7 GPM ft.² spray density. The overlapping of the spray patterns onto the package is shown by the shaded and hatched areas which indicate the spray densities at specific locations on the deck. Referring back to Figure 1, the preferred regenerative tying of the 10 zones is shown schematically. The regeneration is between zones 3 and 6, 2 and 7 and 1 and 8. In other words, the reservoir at precool zone 6 is used to heat the spray to the first heating zone 3. This effect has already been considered in detail previously in connection with the discussion of equalization of P.U. input in a double deck pasteurizer. Similarly, the heat transfer to the cooling water in precool zones 8 and 7 from the hot containers is transferred to preheating zones 1 and 2 respectively so as to reduce energy requirements. Arbitrarily, preheat is defined as a zone where spray water temperature is below about 60 Following in Table II is a summary of the important variables in a preferred tunnel pasteurizer. The key items of zone spray density, spray temperature and average produce temperature is for all packages. The foregoing Table II refers to the sketch and graph of Figure 1. External heaters are provided for zones 4 8 while the cooling water at zones 9 and 10 is 10 C. 50 F from an external chilled water system. The foregoing described process and apparatus has been described specifically with respect to beer, but the process, concept, and apparatus are applicable to all products for which tunnel pasteurization is applicable.
