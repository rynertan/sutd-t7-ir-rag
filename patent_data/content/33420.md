## Description
TIT1 AN hXRESTER BIOME ASSEMBLY AND k GAPIESS ARRESTER INCLUDING SAME This invention relates to arrester block assemblies and gapless arresters including same. In the Specification of our European PatentApplication No 79301507.4 Publication No. 0008181 a number of arrester blocks are described as being located within a resilient insulating housing. Corona and high resistance contacts between arrester blocks are eliminated by using the resiliency of the housing. to compress the blocks. It is well knows that corona bas a deleterious effect upon the insulation and can cause eventual failure of the insulation if it is not eliminated. However, even if the blocks are securely held in position within the arrester assembly, movement can occur between blocks because of the resiliency of the housing, thus affecting the electrical contact and producing voids at the eyterior edges of the blocks. According to the invention there is provided an arrester block assembly, said assembly comprising a plurality of components and en arrester block, the block having a conductive surface on opposite ends of the block, each component having a conductive surface in abutting engagement kith a respective conductive surface of the bloc1. and characterized by an electrically conductive adhesive means connecting said adjacent surfaces. .. olle emboàiment, each component is an arrester block. ln another embodiment, one said component is a spacer plate and another said component is a connector. An arrester block assembly according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention provides for low resistance contact between arrester blocks with a resulting, minimization of corona and a strong physical bond between the arrester blocks of the assembly.This has been accomplished by applying a conductive cement across the entire conductive face of each block.The blocks are then placed in abutting relation with the conductive surfaces adjacent to each other. The conductive cement is then cured to create a strong physical bond and a los resistance electrical connection between the arrester blocks. After curing the cement, the arrester block assembly is placed in the arrester housing. An embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is z side view of a gapless elbow arrester partially broken away to show the arrester block assembly. Figure 2 is a side view of the arrester block assembly. Figure 3 is a bottom view of the arrester block assembly. Referring to Figure 1 of the drawings, a gapless elbow arrester 10 is shown which includes a resilient housing 12 having E bore 22 for an arrester block assembly 14 nd a busying receptacle 23 for quick make probe 16. The arrester block assembl 14 is shown positioned in the housing 12 and retained therein by means of 2 cap assembly 18. The housing 12 generally includes an elastomeric insulating portion 20 and an elastomeric electrically conductive shield 24 provided on the outer surface of the insulating portion 20 an electrically conductive elastomeric insert 26 is provided at the intersection of the bore 22 with the receptacle 23. In this regard, it should be noted that the insert 26 includes a recess 25 to accommodate the arrester block assembly 14 and a bore 27 to accommodate the probe 16. The cap assembly 18 is secured to the housing 12 at the open end of the bore 22. The cap assembly 18 includes a cap 28 having a flange 29 and a contact 30. The cap 28 is secured to the housing 12 by means of the fiange 29 which encircles the outside surface of the conductive shield 24. A rigid tube 31 is placed in the end of the bore 22 to provide rigidity to the housing 12. Referring to figures 2 and 3 the arrester block assembly 14 shown includes a number of arrester blocks 32, a connector or contact 34 and a spacer 36. Lach connector block 32 includes a conductive surface 38 at each end and is coaxial with each of the other connector blocks 32. The outer surface 35 may be provided with an insulating coating if desired. weans are provided for physically connecting the connector blocks to provide a strong one piece structure.Such means is in the form of a conductive cement 37 provided between the conductive surfaces of the arrester blocks. In this embodiment, the connecting means consists of a two component silver filled epoxy cement having a smooth thixotropic paste consistency purchased from Amicon, Polymer Stoducts Dilrision, United States of Avericc, and sold under the name Anicon Systen CT 2523. he to components include a resin CT 2523E and a hardner C 2523 which are mixed in a 1 to 1 ratio to form a ver soft paste. The paste is appliec to the entire surface 38 of each of the blocks 32 which are to be joined. The blocks 32 are then placed in abutting relation conductive surface to conductive surface. The cement is then cured at 1000C for 90 minutes. The cement 37 can also be used to secure the contact 34 and the spacer 36 to the ends of the assembled arrester blocks. In this embodiment, the contact 34 includes E wide angular base 40 and a threaded aperture 42. The base 40 is coated with the cement and the end of the adjacent block 32 is coated with the cement. The parts are assembled and cured as described above. The spacer 36 includes means for aligning the arrester block assembly 14 in the housing. Such means is in the form of a groove or slot 44 provided in the spacer 36. The slot 44 is aligned in a parallel relation to the threaded aperture 42 in the contact 34. When the assembly is positioned in the bore of the arrester housing, the assembly can be rotated to malign the slot with the axis of the probe 16 so that the probe 16 can be threaded into the threaded bore 42. The arrester block assembly 14 is inserted into the bore 22 until the contact 34 is seated in the recess 25 in the insert 26. A screwdriver not shown is then inserted into the slot 44 to rotate the assembly to align the threaded aperture 42 with the bore 27 in the insert 26. The probe 16 is provided with a threaded extension 46 which is screwed into the threaded bore 42. hlthourh the slot 44 in the spacer 36 is shown and described n a parallel relation to the threaded bore 42, it can be located at other angles so long as the location of the threaded bore with respect to the slot 44 is kno n. In this regard, if the slot 44 is located in e pe pendiculE relation to the bore 42, obviously the slot 44 could be turned to a perpendicular relation to the probe s is to align the bore 42 with the probe 16. Ieens is provided for biasing the arrester block assembly 14 into engagement witbthe insert 26. Such means is in the form of a spring 48 positioned between the cap assembly 18 and the spacer 36. Addftiona3 spacers 50 can be provided at the end of the arrester block assembly if required. A shunt 52 is provided as a means for electrically connecting the arrester block assembly 14 to the cap 28.
