# Electronic musical instrument with a waveform memory.

## Abstract
In an electronic musical instrument a played musical instrument sound waveform generating function and a musical rhythm instrument sound waveform generating function are performed by means including a waveform memory in which musical waveform data is memorised, which is employed as a data memory for both functions, and from which data is read out by a pitch producing circuit producing pitch data. In Figure 1, the waveform memory is a read only memory ROM 2 the pitch producing circuit is the circuit 3 there are first and second pitch memories 5 and 22 6, 7, 8 and 11 are selection circuits 9 is an envelope counter 19 is a channel dividing feeding via channels CS0 to CS3 into latch circuits 45 to 48 respectively CLK is a clock signal input line 4 is a keyboard and 10 is a key on detecting circuit. Selected waveform data is supplied by the selector 11 via means including digital analog circuits 12 and 60 and an adder 15 for reproduction by a loud speaker 17.
