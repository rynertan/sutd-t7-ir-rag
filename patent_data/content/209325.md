## Description
This invention relates to a process for preparing a polymer emulsion containing colloidally suspended therein an interpenetrating polymer network wherein a first polymer network is intertwined on a molecular scale with a second polymer network and optionally additional polymer networks. The polymer emulsion of this invention is useful as binder of fibers or fabrics, especially fiberfill. Fiberfill is a generic term used to describe a variety of nonwoven fabrics for a variety of end uses. The common feature of all fiberfill products is a measure of loft or thickness in the fabric. This loft is a characteristic of value because it imparts insulation to outerwear and bed quilt stuffing, cushioning in furniture padding, dust holding capacity to filter media and resiliency to scrubbing pads. The most common construction of a fiberfill product is a loosely garnetted, cross lapped or air laid web of 6 to 30 denier polyester staple fibers which is bonded locked in its particular fiber arrangement by an emulsion polymer binder. Fiberfill products can be made with other fibers, e.g. polyamide, cellulose acetate, rayon, glass, alone or in blends with each other. Some fiberfill is sold without a bonding agent but the material will lack durability, tensile strength and resiliency when compared to a bonded product. Bonding methods other than emulsion polymers, such as needle punching, and meltable fibers and powders are also used, but the polymer emulsion method produces the optimum strength loft ratios for the majority of fiberfill markets. The polymer emulsion product used as the binder is usually one of the following chemical types polyvinylacetate, acrylic copolymers, styrene butadiene copolymers or polyvinylchloride. Polyvinylacetate is the most common binder and in recent years it has been made white enough and strong enough to replace most of the acrylic polymer traditionally used. Polyvinylchloride is used where flame resistance is of prime concern and styrene butadiene copolymers are used for special rubbery applications. The characteristic of initial loft is unaffected by the chemical type of the binder used. However, initial loft is not the loft of value. Fiberfill products in their normal use are compressed, reducing the initial loft, and released many times. The true value of loft is how thick the fiberfill web is after repeated compression recovery cycles. One drawback of current polymer bonded fiberfill technology is that temperatures over 38 The polymer emulsion prepared by the process of this invention provides a binder compound for fiberfill which provides improved resiliency and loft recovery to the bonded fiberfill products. This polymer emulsion is useful in bonding textile fibers in a fiberfill product or in any nonwoven product or even any traditional woven or knitted textile fabric. Briefly, the present invention provides a process for preparing a polymer emulsion containing an interpenetrating polymer network by forming a first polymer emulsion, mixing a second monomer emulsion with the first polymer emulsion, allowing the emulsion mixture to equilibrate and polymerizing the emulsion mixture providing a first polymer network which is intertwined on a molecular scale with the second polymer network. The aqueous polymer emulsion containing an interpenetrating polymer network is prepared by forming a first polymer emulsion. The first polymer emulsion can be prepared by conventional batch, semi continuous or continuous polymerization procedures. These are taught, for example in U.S. Patent No. 2,754,280, 2,795,564, 3,732,184, and in the book entitled The Applications of Synthetic Resin Emulsion by H. Warson, Ernest Benn Limited, London, 1972, pp. 85 to 132. The first polymer emulsion can be formed by polymerizing a monomer or a mixture of monomers herein called a first monomer with an active crosslinking agent. Alternatively the first polymer emulsion can be formed by emulsifying a polymer. The first polymer emulsion is mixed with a second monomer emulsion and then the emulsion mixture is allowed to equilibrate. By equilibration is meant allowing sufficient time for the second monomer to become absorbed into the first polymer. The mixing and equilibration allows the second monomer emulsion to be thoroughly mixed and dispersed throughout the first polymer emulsion on a molecular scale. Then, after thorough mixing and equilibration the emulsion mixture is polymerized providing a first polymer network which is intertwined on a molecular scale with the second polymer network, i.e. an interpenetrating polymer network is formed. Optionally, a third monomer emulsion can then be mixed in, equilibrated, followed by polymerization or further additional monomer emulsions can likewise be intertwined in the polymer networks. When the polymer emulsion is subsequently applied, dried and heated the physical and chemical bonding of the first polymer network with the second polymer network is completed. Because of the interpenetrating network formed, desirable physical properties are achieved. Dual Tg glass transition temperature properties have been observed wherein the polymer has the Tg of both the first polymer and the second polymer. This is especially useful in the application of the polymer emulsion wherein modulus, tensile strength and desirable film forming properties can be adjusted by varying the ratio of the first and second polymers comprised in the interpenetrating network. Because the first and second networks are intertwined on a molecular scale higher tensile strength has been observed as well as higher modulus and higher impact strength at temperatures intermediate the Tg s of the first polymer and the second polymer. The monomers which are polymerized in accordance with the present invention are vinyl monomers, ethylenically unsaturated compounds. Examples of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers are vinyl esters of alkanoic acids having from 1 to about 18 carbon atoms, such a vinyl formate, vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl butyrate, vinyl isobutyrate, vinyl valerate, vinyl 2 ethylhexanoate, vinyl isooctanoate, vinyl nonoate, vinyl decanoate, vinyl pivalate, vinyl ester e.g. Versatic Acid TM, a branched carboxylic acid, marketed by the Shell Oil Corporation , vinyl laurate, and vinyl stearate also alpha olefins, such as ethylene, propylene, butylene, isobutylene, and pentene and the like also maleate, fumarate, and itaconate esters of C₁ C₈ alcohols, such as dibutyl male . ate, dibutyl fumarate, dibutyl itaconate also alkyl acrylates with an alkyl group having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, n butyl, sec butyl, the various isomeric pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, and octyl especially 2 ethylhexyl , lauryl, cetyl, stearyl and like groups also alkyl esters of methacrylic acid with an alkyl group having from 1 to about 18 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, n butyl, n hexyl, 2 ethylhexyl, n octyl, lauryl, cetyl, stearyl and like groups, also vinyl alkyl ethers, having an alkyl group with 1 to 18 carbon atoms, such as methyl vinyl ether, ethyl vinyl ether, butyl vinyl ether and stearyl vinyl ether. Examples of monomers also include diene monomers, such as butadiene, chloroprene, isoprene and similar compounds. Other monomers include aromatic vinyl monomers, such as styrene, alpha methylstyrene, vinyl toluene, 2 bromostyrene, and p chlorostyrene also acrylonitrile, also vinyl halide monomers, such as vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride also benzyl acrylate and t butyl acrylate also vinyl esters of aromatic acids, such as vinylbenzoate. Preferably the polymer present in the first polymer emulsion is either polymethyl methacrylate, polyvinyl acetate, polystyrene or polyacrylonitrile or copolymers of these with other monomers mentioned above, while the second polymer differs from the first polymer and preferably is based upon a monomer such as acrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, styrene or mixtures thereof. In order to obtain desirable dual Tg properties, the polymer in the first polymer emulsion and the polymer derived from the second monomer emulsion can be chosen so, for example, one has a Tg greater than the other. Different pairs of polymers can be chosen to exhibit useful properties over different temperature ranges. For example, because of polystyrene s higher Tg, upon interpenetrating a polyvinyl acetate network it will extend the modulus and reduce distortion of the matrix at elevated temperatures. In general, the various combinations of monomers can be chosen for the first polymer emulsion or the second monomer emulsion. However, the monomer chosen for the first monomer emulsion cannot be an inhibitor to the polymerization of the monomer in the second monomer emulsion. Since acrylonitrile is an inhibitor to the polymerization of vinyl acetate, the vinyl acetate must be in the first polymer emulsion while the acrylo nitrile is in the second monomer emulsion. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the first polymer emulsion contains vinyl acetate or vinylacetate butylacrylate while the second monomer emulsion contains either styrene, methyl methacrylate, acrylonitrile or acrylonitrile butylacrylate. Advantageously, this process of the present invention provides a interpenetrating network of polymers which are generally physically incompatible in that the polymers are not soluble in one another. In addition, this process provides a means of combining polymers which cannot be formed by copolymerization of their monomers. For example, vinyl acetate and styrene cannot be copolymerized and mixing or blending of the two polymers does not result in a polymer having desirable properties e.g. poor tensile strength . The first polymer emulsion and optionally the second monomer emulsion contain an active crosslinking agent. By the term active crosslinking agent is meant a functional monomer which immediately provides crosslinking and branching of the polymer during the initial formation of the emulsion polymer to increase the molecular weight of the emulsion polymer. Subsequent drying or other curing techniques are not required for the crosslinking and branching of the emulsion polymer by the active crosslinking agent. Monomers of this type generally comprise compounds which contain 2 to 5 ethylenically unsaturated groups in one molecule separated by an ester or ether group, or by an aromatic or nitrogenous ring structure, where the unsaturated groups are capable of undergoing additional polymerization by free radical means. Suitable active crosslinking agents include alkylene glycol diacrylates and methacrylates, such as ethylene glycol diacrylate, 1,3 butylene glycol diacrylate, propylkene glycol diacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate etc., 1,3 glycerol dimethacrylate, 1,1,1 trimethylol propane dimethacrylate, 1,1,1 trimethylol ethane diacrylate, pentaerythritol trimethacrylate, sorbitol pentamethacrylate, methylene bisacrylamide, methylene bismethacrylamide, divinyl benzene, vinyl methacrylate, vinyl crotonate, vinyl acrylate, divinyl adipate also di and tri allyl compounds, such a triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate, diallyl phthalate, allyl methacrylate, allyl acrylate, diallyl maleate, diallyl fumarate, diallyl itaconate, diallyl malonate, diallyl carbonate, triallyl citrate, triallyl aconitate also divinyl ether, ethylene glycol divinyl ether and the like. The amount of active crosslinking agent in the polymer emulsion of the present invention is from about 0.01 to 0.5 percent, preferably from about 0.05 to 0.25 percent by weight of the polymer. The first polymer emulsion or the second monomer emulsion, preferably both, additionally contain a latent crosslinking agent. By the term latent cross linking agent is meant a polyfunctional monomer wherein a portion of the functionality enters into the polymerization with other monomers in the polymer emulsion, with the residual functionality causing cross linking of the polymer upon the subsequent application of energy generally by applying heat, e.g. by drying and curing of the latex particles, often in the presence of a catalyst, or by applying radiation, the latent crosslinking agent provides thermosetting characteristics to the polymer emulsion. Upon the subsequent application of energy the latent crosslinking agent forms and insoluble crosslinking network, with the crosslinking being triggered generally by heat or radiation after the polymer emulsion has been formed and applied. Examples of latent crosslinking agents are N alkylolamides of alpha, beta ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids having 3 10 carbons, such as N methylol acrylamide, N ethanol acrylamide, N propanol acrylamide, N methylol methacrylamide, N ethanol metacrylamide, N methylol maleamide, N methylol maleamic acid, N methylol maleamic acid esters the N alkylol amides of the vinyl aromatic acids, such as N methylol p vinylbenzamide and the like also N alkoxymethyl acrylates and methacrylates, where the alkyl group has from 1 8 carbon atoms, such as N methoxymethyl acrylamide, N butyoxymethyl acrylamide, N methoxymethyl methacrylamide, N butoxymethyl allyl carbomate and N methoxymethyl allyl carbamate, and mixtures of these monomers with allyl carbamate, acrylamide or methacrylamide. Epoxy containing monoethylenically unsaturated compounds, such as glycidyl acrylate, glycidyl methacrylate and vinyl glycidyl ether function as latent crosslinking monomers in conjunction with mono and diethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids, such as acrylic methacrylic and itaconic acid, when catalyzed with an alkaline catalyst, such as potassium or sodium carbonate, diethylenetriamine and the like. Hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate and the corresponding methacrylates provide latent crosslinking when combined with N alkylolamides of alpha, beta ethylenically unsaturated acids having 3 10 carbon atoms or with the acids themselves by ester formation. Another group of latent crosslinking monomers is described in U.S. Patents No. 3,678,098 and 4,009,314. These are cationic chlorohydrin compounds having the following formula The crosslinking reaction of these monomers is also catalyzed by the alkaline compounds mentioned above. The amount of latent crosslinking agent in the polymer of the present invention is about from 0.5 to 10 percent, preferably from about 2 to 6 percent by weight of the polymer. The emulsions of the present invention are prepared in the presence of suitable anionic, cationic or nonionic emulsifiers or mixtures thereof. Optionally, protective colloids, illustrated by polyvinyl alcohol and hydroxyethyl cellulose, may also be present. Suitable nonionic emulsifying agents include alkylphenoxypolyethoxyethanols having alkyl groups of about 10 to 60 carbon atoms and 10 to 60 or more oxyethylene units, such as octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanols, methyloctylphenoxypolyethoxyethanols, nonylphenoxypolyethoxyethanols, dodecylphenoxypolyethoxyethanols also ethylene oxide derivatives of long chained carboxylic acids, such as lauric, myristic, palmitic, oleic, and stearic acid, containing 10 to 60 oxyethylene units per molecule also analogous ethylene oxide condensates of long chained alcohols, such as octyl, decyl, lauryl, stearyl and cetyl alcohols, ethylene oxide derivatives of etherified or esterified polyhydroxy compounds having a hydrophobic component, such as lauric, myristic, palmitic, oleic, and stearic acid, containing 10 to 60 oxyethylene units per molecule also analogous ethylene oxide condensates of long chained alcohols, such as octyl, decyl, lauryl, stearyl, and cetyl alcohols, ethylene oxide derivatives of etherified or esterified polyhydroxy compounds having a hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain, such as sorbitan monostearate containing 10 to 60 oxyethylene units also block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide comprising a hydrophobic propylene oxide section combined with one or more hydrophilic ethylene oxide sections. Suitable anionic emulsifying agents include higher fatty alcohol sulfates, such as sodium lauryl sulfate the alkylaryl sulfonates, such as the sodium salt of t octylphenyl sulfonate, the sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinates, disodium fatty alkyl alkanolamide sulfosuccinate, and the ammonium salt of a sulfate or phosphate ester of an alkylphenoxy poly ethyleneoxy ethanol, where the oxyethylene content is from 3 to 30 moles per alkylphenol. Suitable cationic emulsifiers include N dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, and N vinyl benzyl trimethyl ammonium chloride and the like. Generally, the polymer emulsions of this invention contain from 1 to 10 percent, preferably from 3 to 6 percent, emulsifiers based on the weight of the monomers solids . In the polymerization process used in making the first polymer emulsion of the invention an aqueous phase is prepared first containing water, a small portion of a nonionic emulsifier, sometimes also mixture of anionic and nonionic emulsifiers, and a very small amount of ferrous sulfate, being a redox component in the finishing catalyst system for the polymer emulsion. The aqueous phase is purged well with nitrogen, and heated to polymerization temperatures e.g. 60 to 70 C . A small portion of monomer, is then added followed by a suitable amount of initial catalyst, most often from about 1 to 3 percent based on the weight of the initial monomer charge. Often it is advantageous to use potassium persulfate as the catalyst because the resulting polymer has better resistance to heat discoloration. But sodium or ammonium persulfates can also be used. After the emulsion polymerization has initiated, the rest of the monomers are gradually added to the reaction mixture, often emulsified in water together with the latent crosslinking agents and the active crosslinking agents. Generally, the gradual addition of the monomers is carried out over a time period of one to five hours. More catalyst solution is also added gradually to maintain the polymerization reaction. Often cooling is applied to the reaction vessel by means of a waterbath to remove the excess heat of polymerization. Usually, a total of 0.2 to 1 percent of catalyst based on the weight of the monomers, is added over the course of the emulsion polymerization. After all the monomer has been added optionally a small amount of an organic peroxide, such as t butyl hydroperoxide and cumene hydroperoxide, and the like can be added for the finishing step, together with a small amount of a reducing agent, such as sodium metabisulfate, sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate and zinc formaldehyde sulfoxylate. In place of an organic peroxide, hydrogen peroxide or persulfates, such as potassium, sodium or ammonium persulfates may also be used. The terminal catalyst necessary to finish the reaction is generally about 10 to 30 percent by weight of the total amount of catalyst consumed during the reaction. The reducing agent is ordinarily added in the necessary equivalent amount. Normally no buffering agent is required to keep the pH between 3 and 5. If necessary, dilute ammonia may be added from time to time to adjust the pH within those limits. Other auxiliary agents may be added to the finished polymer emulsion, such as defoamers, biocides and the like. After the first polymer emulsion is cooled a second monomer emulsion is introduced into the reactor as fast as possible containing water, monomer or mixture of monomers, emulsifiers and a small amount of ferrous sulfate redox component . Following thorough mixing and equilibration e.g. 10 to 60 minutes of the first and second emulsions a second polymerization step is initiated by the addition of catalyst solution and then the reducing solution. The polymer emulsion of this invention generally contains from 5 to 95 , preferably 20 to 80 on a solids by weight basis of the first polymer emulsion. The polymer emulsion may be applied to a substrate and then dried and heated to complete bonding of the first and second networks, especially when either or, preferably, both contain latent cross linking groups. The polymer emulsions of the present invention are useful as binders, adhesives and coatings. These polymer emulsions when used as binders provide high temperature resiliency to bonded fiberfill products. The polymer emulsions are useful in bonding textile fibers in a fiberfill product or other nonwoven product or even in traditional woven or knitted textile fabrics. Generally, based on the weight of the fiberfill product the binder can comprise 2 to 50 . A polymer emulsion is prepared as follows containing a polymer which is an interpenetrating network of polyvinyl acetate and polystyrene. The following was charged to a 100 gal. 379 liter stainless steel pilot reactor equipped with a variable agitator, temperature control system, feed pumps, means for purging the reactor with nitrogen, and a jacket for heating and cooling Notes A polymer emulsion is prepared containing a polymer which is an interpenetrating network of polyvinyl acetate and polymethyl methacrylate by the same method as Example 1 except that the 45.5kg styrene is replaced by 45.4kg methyl methacrylate. A typical fiberfill product for quilt stuffing was constructed of 6 denier 5cm staple length polyester fiber with garnetted and crosslapped webs to a weight of 135.6 g m² 4 oz. yd.² . This web was then spray bonded wit a commercially available polyvinylacetate emulsion polymer SUNCRYL RW 41SP from Sun Chemical Corporation , and the polymer emulsion as prepared in Examples 1 and 2, producing a final fiberfill product composed of 82 fibers and 18 bonding polymer. The binder mix is prepared in a tank by diluting the emulsions with water to a 22 nonvolatile content. This mix is pumped with reciprocating airless pumps at a pressure of 21kg cm² and delivered through spray nozzles of O.48mm diameter which traverse the polyester fiber web. The polyester web is passed under the traversing sprays so as to achieve a uniform application of the bonding mix. The web and applied mix are passed through a forced air oven to remove the water and coalesce the binder polymer onto the fibers. The web is turned over and the process repeated on the back side. Finally the web is passed through the oven a third time to cure the binder, rendering it durable and resistant to water and solvent interactions. The residual loft value was simulated by the following test. 254 mm x 254 mm squares of the fiberfill material are cut and stacked vertically. The height of this stack is measured H₁ . The stack is then compressed by placing weights on top of the stack. A typical weight of 9 kg usually reduces the initial stack height by 50 to 75 . The stack is left in this compressed state for a period of time 1 hour is typical at a stated temperature and then the weight is removed. The stack of fiberfill is allowed to recover for a further period of time 10 minutes is typical and the height is again measured H₂ . The recovery is stated as a ratio of the final height to the initial height Table 1 shows recovery values of a 6 layer stack compressed with 0.014kg cm² 0.2 psi, 20 lbs. on a 10 x 10 square for 16 hours and then allowed to recover for 1 hour at the stated temperatures. Although all the binders are affected by temperature the polyvinyl acetate bonded fiberfill loses more loft at 44 A more detailed study was made of the binder utilizing the polymer emulsion prepared in Example 1 on a slightly different fabric, a 50 50 blend of 6 and 15 denier polyester. Web preparation and bonding were similar to Example 3. Finished fiberfill weight for this furniture pad material was 610.3g m² 18oz. yd.² with a fiber content of 81 and a binder content of 19 . The same loft recovery test was conducted at 49
