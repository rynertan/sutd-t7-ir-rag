# Solid state color imaging apparatus.

## Abstract
In a solid state color imaging apparatus, in horizontal di rection the color filter has two segments for each one picture element of solid state image sensor and color segments pat tern is repeated with a period of two picture elements, and sum of light transparency of color filter segments for the two pic ture elements are made equal for all lines of the picture ele ments for instance in odd number lines four color segments for the horizontal two picture elements are magenta MG , cy an CY , green G and yellow YE and their repetition, and in even order lines, MG, YE, G, CY and their repetition thus, i.e., high resolution, good vertical brightness uniformity and good S N ratio are attainable.
