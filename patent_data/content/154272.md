## Description
This invention relates to a method of producing glycosylated single chain pro urokinase hereinafter referred to as pro UK . More particularly, it relates to a method of producing glycosylated pro UK which comprises recovering mRNA from an established human kidney derived cell line, preparing cDNA based on said mRNA, inserting the cDNA into a vector, introducing the resulting plasmid into an animal cell to thereby produce a transformant, and recovering glycosylated pro UK from said animal cell. Urokinase is a plasminogen activator obtainable from human urine and can produce excellent therapeutic effects in the treatment of various forms of thrombosis or embolic diseases as well as in the combined use with an anticancer agents. Currently, urokinase is produced mainly from human urine by some or other purification method cf. Williams, J. R. B. Br. J. Exp. Pathol., As a result of cell culture technology development in search of a substitute method, the method comprising isolating human kidney cells, subculturing the cells and recovering urokinase from the culture is becoming a second important method. However, recent improvements in the recombinant DNA technology have made it possible to produce desired proteins on a commercial scale by using microorganisms such as Under these circumstances, the present inventors studied in an attempt to develop a method of producing urokinase using recombinant DNA techniques. As a result, they obtained mRNA from an established human kidney derived cell line, prepared the cDNA sequence shown in the following sequence I by using said mRNA as the template, cultivated animal cells transformed with a plasmid with said cDNA sequence inserted therein and obtained glycosylated pro UK, and have now completed the present invention. Thus, the present invention relates to a method of producing glycosylated singly chain pro urokinase which comprises recovering mRNA from an establised human kidney derived cell line, preparing cDNA based on said mRNA, inserting the cDNA into a vector, introducing the resulting plasmid into an animal cell to thereby produce a transformant, and recovering glycosylated pro UK from said animal cell. The pro UK according to the invention was produced in the following manner Of these transformants, 10,000 colonies were subjected to screening for selecting urokinase cDNA. Based on the amino acid sequence of urokinase, a mixture of eight 14 mer oligodeoxyribonucleotides, namely was synthetically prepared and used as a hybridization probe in screening for urokinase cDNA by colony hybridization. As a result, four positive colonies expected to contain urokinase cDNA were obtained. Plasmid DNAs pUK1 through 4 were prepared from these four colonies and measured for the size of cDNA. pUK1, pUK2, pUK3 and pUK4 were found to contain 1900 bp, 170 bp, 1150 bp and 1300 bp cDNAs, respectively. Detailed restriction enzyme cleavage maps were prepared for pUK1, pUK2 and pUK3, whereby these cDNAs gave restriction maps overlapping one another cf. Fig. 1 . The partial DNA base sequence each of pUK1 and pUK4 as determined by the Maxam Gilbert method was in agreement with the DNA base sequence deduced from the known amino acid sequence of urokinase. pUK1 had about 670 bp long 3 noncoding region containing cDNA whereas pUK4 had a signal peptide and 5 noncoding region containing cDNA. These pUK1 and pUK4 were joined together taking advantage of the It was thus revealed that urokinase is constituted by a signal peptide composed of 20 amino acids and the subsequent 411 amino acids. Furthermore, the DNA base sequence of urokinase cDNA and other data revealed that a 5 noncoding region comprising not less than 80 bases and a 3 noncoding region comprising not less than 800 bases occur in urokinase mRNA cf. Sequence II . The thus obtained urokinase cDNA was inserted into a vector usable in a heterologous gene expression system in animal cells, followed by introduction into animal cells. Production of glycosylated pro UK with molecular weight of 54,000 dalton in the transformant cells thus obtained was confirmed. In the accompanying drawings, The synthesis of cDNA was performed by the method of Maruin, P. W. et al. J. Biol. Chem., For the synthesis of second strand DNA, DNA was first synthesized using DNA polymerase I and then the DNA chain was extended using reverse transcriptase. There was thus obtained 5.3 µg of ds cDNA. Thereafter, synthetic extention of second strand DNA was conducted using reverse transcriptase. The ds cDNA obtained was then subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation 38,000 rpm, 4 C and large molecular weight fractions were collected. The ultracentrifugation sedimentation pattern of urokinase ds cDNA is shown in Fig. 2 indicated by in the figure , together with the sedimentation pattern of globin ds cDNA as a marker indicated by in the figure . Urokinase ds cDNA shows a slight shift of the peak fraction to the bottom as compared with globin ds cDNA. Urokinase ds cDNA was also more abundant in large ds cDNA in fractions 11 to 15 and the neighboring fractions. Therefore, fractions 6 15 were collected and used as large ds cDNA. This large ds cDNA weighed 722 ng. The C tail addition reaction was conducted on the assumption that urokinase ds cDNA is on an average 1,500 bp in size. The C tail reaction should ideally be conducted such that a poly C tail comprising 15 to 20 dCs is added to the 3 OH terminal of ds cDNA. The inventors used 5 units of terminal transferase and carried out the reaction at 37 C. As a result, about 20 dCs were added as the C tail. In the same manner, a poly G tail comprising about 15 dGs was added to the The For cloning urokinase cDNA, an oligodeoxyribonucleotide mixture was synthesized based on the known amino acid sequence of Urinary Urokinase and transformant screening was conducted using this as a hybridization probe. Using 3.0 x 10⁸ cpm of the ³²P labelled probe, 10,000 colonies 100 filters were screened. The total amount of HS was 150 ml and therefore the probe concentration was 2.0 x 10⁶ cpm ml. The hybridization was conducted at 37 C for 21 hours with occasional shaking. Thereafter, the filter was washed with WS II three times at room temperature and then three times at 37 C. The dried filter was placed on a filter paper Whatman 3MM , and autoradiography was performed at 70 C for 2 days, followed by development. As a result, 65 colonies seemingly indicative of relatively high rate of hybridization were selected and again fixed on a filter for rescreening. The 65 colonies selected were arranged on an L agar plate with pBR322 as a negative control , and 2 filters of the same kind were prepared. Hybridization was conducted with the probe using the filters in pairs, the probe DNA concentration being 5.8 x 10⁵ cpm ml oligonucleotide species. After 21 hours of hybridization at 37 C, the filters were washed with WS II. One filter was dried at 37 C directly after washing, while the other was further washed three times at 42 C for 3 minutes, followed by exposure of an X ray film thereto. In this hybridization experiments, four colonies were found to be indicative of hybridization with the probe DNA. After washing at 42 C, these 4 colonies were still clearly recognized as positive colonies. For the 4 colonies selected, plasmid DNAs named pUK1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively were prepared and examined for the size of cDNA. Among the 4 plasmids pUK1 had the largest cDNA of about 1,900 bp. pUK3 and pUK4 were smaller than pUK1 and were about 1,300 bp and about 1,150 bp in size, respectively. pUK2 was the smallest cDNA about 170 bp in size. Since, in the restriction enzyme maps, pUK1, 3 and 4 showed overlapping with one another, they were considered to have cloned different regions of one and the same mRNA. The restriction enzyme maps were prepared for comparison for the four plasmids selected in the above. The restriction enzymes used were For As already mentioned hereinabove, the size of cDNA inserted in pUk1 is 1,900 bp and the largest among pUK1 through 4. The size of pUK3 and that of pUK4 are 1,300 bp and 1,150 bp, respectively. The cDNA of pUK2 is a fairly small and 170 bp in size. Therefore, for the three plasmids except pUK2, the restriction enzyme map of each cDNA was prepared. Table 6 show the number of restriction sites for each enzyme was determined Table 6 and thus the distance between restriction enzyme sites was determined for each enzyme. Upon cleavage with Since the cDNAs inserted in pUK1, pUK3 and pUK4 could be regarded as one and the same in view of the restriction enzyme sites occurring therein, the possibility that these three cDNAs each might be the urokinase cDNA became very great. The grounds are that, in spite of very low probability of plasmids having a sequence identical with the base sequence of the synthetic 14 mer DNA used in screening, 3 out of the 4 colonies found to be positive in the screening had the same cDNA, rendering high the probability that the cDNA owned by these positive colonies might have the desired sequence for urokinase and that the position of the DNA base sequence synthesized as a probe on urokinase mRNA Fig. 3 agreed with the place of overlapping among pUK1, pUK3 and pUK4 Fig. 1 . The DNA base sequence of part of pUK1 and of pUK4 was determined. The corresponding amino acid sequence deduced was in agreement with the amino acid sequence of urokinase. For the purpose of directly clarifying whether the plasmids obtained by the procedure mentioned in the preceding paragraph did contain the urokinase cDNA, the DNA base sequence was determined by the Maxam Gilbert method. Comparison of the possible amino acid sequence deducible from the DNA base sequence obtained with the known amino acid sequence of human urinary urokinase revealed that cloned cDNAs is a sequence for signal peptide containing pro UK. Comparison of the DNA base sequence obtained by sequencing with the amino acid sequence of human urinary urokinase Sequence III revealed that pUK1, 4 and 18 each contained part of pro UK cDNA. The following Sequence IV shows the total base sequence, from the 5 end to the 3 noncoding region, of the cDNA coding for an amino acid sequence equivalent to that of urokinase, as determided on the basis of the results of sequencing of individual fragments. Hereinafter, mention is made of the structure of the cDNA coding for an amino acid sequence equivalent to single chain pro urokinase as obtained in accordance with the present invention. pUK1 and pUK4 were digested with the restriction enzymes
