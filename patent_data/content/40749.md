# FLAME TRAP APPARATUS FOR USE ON GAS OR OIL BURNERS

## Abstract
The invention relates to a flame trap apparatus for use on gas or oil burners. The device comprises a preferably cylindrical tubular body 10 adapted to form, in use, an extension of the flame emitting head 80 of a burner, and an intercepting element 30 lo cated inside the tubular body 10 and defining a narrow peripheral passage 13 therewith. The flame trap device limits a chamber 15 close to the head 80 . Within the chamber 15 , the flame generated by the burner hits the intercepting element 30 . The combustion gases are thus deflected from their path and compelled to thoroughly mix, partly strike the inner wall of the tubular body 10 , and then flow toward the passage 13 .
