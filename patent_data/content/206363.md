## Description
The invention relates to a semiconductor device for determining or controlling the position of a radiation beam which is incident upon a major surface of a radiation sensitive semiconductor body provided with at least two radiation sensitive diodes which form a rectifying junction with an adjacent part of the semiconductor body and are provided with electrical connections to drain away electric current produced by the incident radiation. The position of the radiation beam is to be understood to mean the position of the balance of the beam. As usual, the term balance is to be understood to mean the point at which the number of photons incident per unit time is the same on either side of this point. With symmetrical beams this point coincides with the axis of the beam. Radiation sensitive semiconductor devices of the aforementioned kind are used, for example, in photosensitive circuit arrangements for picture display and in arrangements for tracking or positioning light beams or beams of radiation of other kinds . Other applications of radiation detection are in the field of spectroscopic analysis, especially in the wavelength range of from 200 to 1100 nm, and, for example, soft X ray radiation. Such arrangements are also used for detection of particle radiation for example electrons, α particles or high energetic particles . Such semiconductor devices especially in the wavelength range of visible light are also used in measuring apparatus for position determination, after example for measuring a bend, or, for example, in automatic assembly lines. The invention further relates to a focus error detection system provided with a semiconductor device according to the invention. A semiconductor device of the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph is described in the Netherlands Patent Application No. 8003906 of the Applicant laid open to public inspection on February 1 The quadrant diode described therein acts very rapidly, indeed, and has a transition curve of high steepness, but during mounting, the diode has to be mounted so that with correct focusing the radiation beam strikes the semiconductor surface exactly between the four quadrants of the diode. In view of the tolerances then required the relative distance of the quadrants is approximately 5 µm , such a mounting process with associated adjustment is different and time consuming. Similar with a view to mounting arise in a focus error detection system in which a beam splitting element followed by a radiation sensitive detection system comprising a plurality of detectors separated from each other by narrow strips is arranged in the path of the beam reflected by the radiation reflecting surface, the subbeams formed by the beam splitting element being incident upon the separation strips. In the latter case, it can be ensured that the centres of the radiation spots formed by the subbeams in the detector surface are incident upon the separation strips with a correct focusing by causing the separation strips to enclose an acute angle with each other. By means of a mechanical displacement of the detector surface, a correct initial adjustment can then be obtained, as is described more fully in Netherlands Patent Application No. 8202058 of the Applicant. This mechanical adjustment may vary with time and or with temperature, however, after which a new and often laborius adjustment of the detector plane is necessary. The invention has for its object to provide a semiconductor device of the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph, which can be used inter alia in such a focus detection system, in which the zero adjustment can be effected in a considerably simpler manner. Such a semiconductor device can further be designed and used for applications other than the aforementioned applications. The object of the invention is met by the features recited in claim 1. The invention is based on the recognition of the fact that in such a semiconductor device a simple electromechanical or electronic zero adjustment is possible by utilizing the differential current through the diodes which adjustment replaces in the case of the focus detection system the mechanical adjustment displacement and locking . Thus, a less accurate mounting is sufficient, while nevertheless a satisfactory high frequency behaviour is maintained. The said zero adjustment may be effected, for example, by means of a variable resistor or It will be appreciated that the balance zero adjustment is not necessarily situated at the same distance from the diodes and can be displaced by modification of the bias voltage of one or both diodes along their connection line. The adjustment system in which the device is included adjusts the position of the incoming radiation in such a manner that the balance of the incoming radiation beam with the exception of a minimum error signal coincides with the zero adjustment or calibration adjustment. The said diodes may be metallic zones forming a Schottky junction with the adjustment semiconductor material. Preferably, however these diodes are formed by semiconductor zones forming pn junctions with an adjacent part of the semiconductor body. The photocurrents detected by the diodes may be recorded directly, if desired, for further signal processing. Preferably, however, the adjustment circuits for the zero adjustment produce output signals which are related to the diode currents. The invention will now be explained more fully with reference to a few embodiments, in which The Figures are schematic and not drawn to scale, while in the cross sections especially the dimensions in the direction of thickness are strongly exaggerated for the sake of clarity. Semiconductor zones of the same conductivity type are generally cross hatched in the same direction in the different embodiments, corresponding parts are generally designated by the same reference numerals. Fig. 1 shows diagrammatically in cross section a part of a semiconductor device according to the invention. This device comprises a semiconductor body 1 of silicon. This semiconductor body 1 comprises a low ohmic substrate 2 on which is formed an epitaxial layer 3 having a thickness of approximately 10 µm and a resistivity of the order of 20 to 200 Ωcm. The semiconductor body 1 is provided at a practically flat surface 4 with radiation sensitive diodes having rectifying junctions 5, 5 . The semiconductor body 1 is provided for this purpose at its surface 4 with semi conductor zones 6 of the The surface 4 of the semiconductor body 1 is further covered with a passivating anti reflection layer 7 of silicon oxide or silicon oxide with, for example, silicon nitride. The layer 7 is provided with contact windows 8 for conducting contacts 9 9 By means of an electrical voltage at the contacts 9, 10, the pn junctions 5, 5 , can be biased in the reverse direction. As a result, a depletion region, indicated in Fig. 1, by broken lines, is formed at each pn junction 5, 5 in the epitaxial layer 3 and the associated semiconductor zones 6, 11. As far as these depletion regions extend in the epitaxial layer 3, they are denoted by reference numeral 12. The electric field lines due to electric fields prevailing in such regions 12 are indicated by arrows 13. The high ohmic layer 11 may have such a low doping that the boundary indicated by the broken line of the depletion region at a sufficiently high bias voltage at the diodes extends practically as far as the surface. The current I The high ohmic region 11 may be realized, for example, by ion implantation, the doping of the semiconductor material between the zones 6A and 6B being substantially compensated for. The dose that causes the layer 11 to be produced is also influenced by the fixed charges present in the dielectric layer 7. However, the high ohmic layer 11 may also be obtained by means of a gate electrode which is transparent to the incident radiation and is applied to such a bias voltage that a current I When a light beam or radiation beam is incident on the surface 4 of the semiconductor body 1, which has a sufficiently high energy at least equal to the band gap of the forbidden band of the semiconductor material , additional charge carriers holes and electrons are generated in the semiconductor body. In the depletion regions, these additional charge carriers are dissipated due to the prevailing field and thus contribute to a photoelectric current through the pn junction 5. If the balance of the radiation beam is incident about halfway between the semiconductor zones 6 beam In practice, this width generally depends upon the tolerances of the optical system this width is chosen so that it is of the same order as the range of said diameter of the radiation beam when the latter is focused to the optimum on the device. On the other hand, this width is preferably chosen as small as possible in connection with high frequency properties and steepness of the transition curve of the radiation sensitive semiconductor device. The balance of the beam b also shown in Fig. 1 is not incident halfway between the semiconductor zones 6 upon the surface 4. The charge carriers mainly generated in the region 14 again give rise to a photocurrent I , which photocurrent is split up at the region 14 into subcurrents I According to the invention, such voltages are now applied to the contacts 9 The dimensions of the zones 6, 11 depend, as stated, upon the application. The contacts 9 If such a semiconductor device with the associated feedback mechanism is mounted in an optical system, after the whole has been assembled, the beam It should be noted with respect to the above considerations that, when varying the voltages which are negative in this embodiment at the contacts 9 Fig. 2 shows diagrammatically how the aforementioned zero adjustment can be attained independently of the location at which the beam By means of a variable voltage divider 17, whose variable connection 18 is connected to a voltage which is derived The final adjustment of such a device in an optoelectronic arrangement can be made after this optoelectronic arrangement has been assembled and, for example, the focus of an objective system has been correctly adjusted. The position of an incident beam is then measured by measuring the difference of the photocurrents I Thus, a control system is obtained, which can be mounted with large tolerances and in which the calibration is effected substantially entirely electrically or electronically. Of course other circuits may be used than the variable voltage divider 17 and the operational amplifiers that are fed back shown here diagrammatically . The overall photocurrent I can be measured both directly and by means of an operational amplifier circuit comprising an operational amplifier 15 and a feedback resistor 16, as shown in Fig. 2. Figures 3 and 4 show a semiconductor device according to the invention comprising a semiconductor body 1 in which the overall photocurrent I is split up into four subcurrents I Fig. 5 shows how for this purpose the sub photocurrents I If after this calibration the position of the incident beam has slightly shifted with respect to this point b , differences in the output currents I The device shown in Figs. 3, 4 comprises besides the semiconductor zones 6 A semiconductor device of the kind shown in Figures 3, 4 can be manufactured by techniques generally known in the semiconductor technology. The starting material is an n type silicon substrate 2, on which the Although satisfactory results can be obtained with the device of Figs. 3, 4 in positioning in two dimensions, the transmission characteristics are not fully linear. A better linearity is obtained by means of the device shown in Figs. 6, 7, 8, in which a second set of semiconductor zones 58 of the The device comprises a p or π type substrate 2, on which an n or ν type epitaxial layer is grown. Before the epitaxial growth, the buried layers 57, 58 are defined, the semiconductor zones 58 being doped more highly by selective implantation. These The substrate 2 may also be of the In the processing unit 40, the subcurrents are added again to determine the overall photocurrent, while this unit 40 supplies at the outputs 60 signals for, for example, controlling the beam A semiconductor device according to the invention may be used, for example, in a focus detection system of the kind shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9 shows in a radial sectional view a small part of a circular disk shaped record carrier 21. The radiation reflecting information structure is situated on the upper side of the record carrier and consists of a large number of information regions not shown which are arranged in accordance with information tracks 22. The information structure is scanned by a reading beam The reading beam is reflected by the information structure and when the record carrier is moved relative to the reading beam, the reflected beam is modulated in time in accordance with the information stored in the record carrier. In order to separate the modulated beam from the beam emitted by the radiation source, a beam splitting prism 26 is arranged between the radiation source and the objective system. This prism can comprise two prismatic parts 27 and 28, between which a beam splitting layer 29 is provided. Reference numerals 30 and 31 denote the entrance surface and the exit surface, respectively, of the prism 26. The layer 29 may be semitransparent mirror. In order to limit the radiation loss in the reading unit to a minimum, a polarization sensitive separation layer may be used. In this case, there has to be arranged between the objective system and the prism 26 a λ 4 plate 32, where λ is the wavelength of the reading beam In order to produce a focus error signal, which gives an indication about the value and the direction of a deviation between the focusing surface of the objective system and the surface of the information structure, a roof prism 34 is provided on the exit surface 31 of the beam splitting prism 26 and the radiaton sensitive detection system 33 is composed of, for example, two radiation sensitive devices of the kind described with reference to Figs. 1 and 2. These two devices are denoted by reference numerals 36 and 37 in Fig. 11, which illustrates the principle of the focus error detection. This Figure shows The refracting rib 35 of the prism 34 may be parallel to the optical axis OO in Fig. 9 of the reading unit. Preferably, however, as shown in Fig. 9, the roof prism is arranged so that the refracting rib 35 is at right angles to the optical axis OO . In fact a tracking error signal can then be derived from the detector signals too. The roof prism splits up the beam Figs. 9 and 11 show the situation in which the reading beam is focused exactly on the surface of the information structure. The reading unit may be designed so that the focus of the reflected beam is then located exactly in the surface 2 of the semiconductor devices 1 of the detectors 36, 37, which detectors have a structure similar to that shown in Figs. 1, 2. With a correct focusing, the subbeams b₁ and b₂ are incident symmetrically upon the high ohmic zones 11 associated with the detectors 36 ant 37 between the semiconductor zones 6 Upon the occurrence of a focus error, the energy distribution within the subbeams b₁ and b₂, respectively, varies with respect to the associated detectors, which can also be considered as a displacement of the radiation spots V₁ and V₂ produced by the subbeams with respect to the detectors. If the focus of the beam originating from the radiation source should be located above the surface of the information structure, the beams b₁ and b₂ would be displaced inwards and the semiconductor zones 6 It has to be ensured that with a correct focusing the balance of the radiation spots V₁ and V₂ is apparently located halfway between the zones 6 After the said zero adjustment has been effected, the signals originating from the operational amplifiers 15 can be used for signal processing. For this purpose, the signals 47 and 48 cf. Figs. 10, 11 which are a measure for the photo currents through the zones 6 When, as shown in Fig. 9, the refracting rib 35 of the prism 34 is arranged at right angles to the optical axis OO , the radiation spots V₁ and V₂ are relatively displaced in a direction which is effectively at right angles to the track direction. In this case, a tracking signal, a signal giving an indication about the position of the reading spot V with respect to the centre of a track to be read, can be derived from the signals 46, 47, 48 and 49 originating from the operational amplifier 15 Fig. 11 . This signal S If the arrangement shown in Figs. 9, 10 is not used for producing a tracking signal S The focus detection system is described with reference to its use in an optical reading unit, but may also be used in a writing unit or in a combined writing reading unit. The writing unit is composed in a manner analogous to that of the reading unit described, For writing information, for example by melting depressions into a metal layer, a larger amount of energy is required than for reading, while moreover the writing beam has to be modulated in time in accordance with the information to be written. As a radiation source in the writing unit, use may be made of a gas laser, such as a He Ne laser, in which a modulator, such as an electro optical or an acousto optical modulator, has to be arranged in the path of the writing beam. Alternatively, a diode laser may be used, in which event the modulation of the writing beam may be obtained by variation of the electric current through the diode laser so that no separate modulator is required. The semiconductor device shown in Figs. 1 and 2 may also be used for measuring small displacements, for example on behalf of mechanical tests bending, strain measurement etc. . As already stated above, the high ohmic layer 11 may be formed in a manner other than by doping. Fig. 13 shows diagrammatically in cross section and Fig. 14 shows in plan view a device according to the invention, in which in the operating condition the layer 11 is formed by means of a gate electrode 80, which is transparent at least in part to the incident radiation. This gate electrode 80 is disposed on a dielectric layer 7 of, for example, silicon oxide which, as in the preceding embodiments, may also serve as an antireflection layer. The gate electrode 80 is applied to such a potential that in the operating condition a current can flow between the zones 6A and 6B if these zones are applied to different voltages. This voltage difference in turn determines the location of the calibration point on the connection line between the zones 6A and 6B. When these zones have a relative distance of, for example, 14 µm, the calibration point can be displaced electronically in this manner over about 6 µm. Although this will mostly be the case, the high ohmic layer 11 need not have a conductivity type opposite to that of the subjacent layer 3. In principle, it is sufficient for the layer 11 to have such a low netcharge carrier concentration that a certain punch through is possible between the semiconductor zones or diodes 6A and 6B. In the semiconductor bodies, the conductivity types of the semiconductor regions may be converted simultaneously whilst simultaneously adapting the electrical voltages in the adjustment system. In the arrangement of Fig. 11, the radiation sensitive devices 36, 37 can be formed in one semiconductor body, after which mutual electrical isolation is obtained, for example, by etching a groove, which, if required may again be filled with insulating material. Furthermore, semiconductor materials other than silicon may be used, such as, for example, germanium or compounds of the III V type, such as gallium arsenide. Instead of by semiconductor zones 6, the depletion regions 12 may also be formed by metallic zones forming Schottky contacts on the semiconductor layer 3, which metallic zones then have to be transparent to radiation, of course. For this purpose, they are made for example of antimonydoped tin oxide or of Instead of providing the semiconductor zones 6 in the epitaxial layer 3, they may also be provided directly in the substrate, in which event the substrate material has a resistivity of, for example, 10 Ω cm. Furthermore, the high ohmic zone need not necessarily contact the surface 4 and may be separated therefrom by a part of the substrate. Such a configuration may be obtained by providing the zones 11 by ion implantation at a high energy and is particularly suitable for detection of high energetic particles. Moreover, the adjustment circuits may be realized advantageously in the same semiconductor body as the body in which the radiation sensitive device and any auxiliary electronic means is situated. The focus error detection system described does not utilize special properties of the optical information structure or of the surface on which focusing has to take place. It is required and sufficient only that this surface is radiation reflecting. The focus error detection system can therefore be used in various arrangements, in which focusing has to be very accurate, for example in microscopes.
