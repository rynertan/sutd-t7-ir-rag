# Spiral flex circuit system for steering wheels.

## Abstract
A conductor assembly for conveying signals between steering wheel 10 and column 12 to permit control of mul tiple functions headlights, wipers, cruise control, etc. from the steering wheel 10 . Electrical connection is established through a multiple conductor ribbon like cable 42 which is wound about a central hub 52 within the conductor as sembly enclosure 24 . When the wheel 10 is turned from lock to lock, the cable 42 doubles back upon itself so that a minimum cable length is required. To facilitate installation, the enclosure 24 includes a self locking mechanism 84, 86, 88 to insure that the cable 42 cannot be wound or un wound until the assembly is installed on the vehicle.
