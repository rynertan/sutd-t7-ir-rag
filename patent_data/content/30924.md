The invention will now be described with reference to the appended drawings, provided purely by way of non example, in which Figure 1 is a partial perspective view which illustrates a motor vehicle seat according to the present invention in a first condition of use, Figure 2 is a side view which illustrates the seat of Figure 1 in a second condition of use, Figure 3 is a perspective view on an enlarged scale of a detail of Figure 1, Figure 4 is an exploded perspective view of the detail illustrated in Figure 3, Figure 5 is a side view of the detail ofFigure 3, Figure 6 is a view of the detail of Figure 3 in.the direction of the arrow A shown in Figure 5, Figure 7 is a section taken on the line Vil Vil of Figure 6, Figure 8 is an exploded perspective view on an enlarged scale of a detail of Figure 1, Figure 9 is a side view of the detail ofFigure 8, and Figure 10 is a section taken on the line X X of Figure 9 In the drawings there is generally indicated a seat 1 for motor vehicles, comprising a flexible squab 2 and a seat back 3. The squab 2 has two elongate through holes 4, 5 formed, respectively, along its front edge 6 and along its rear edge 7. A support member 8 constituted by a tubular element bent into the form of a U, has its central branch 9 inserted into the hole 4 and its two end arms 10 one of which is visible in Figure 1 pivoted at their free ends on to supports 11 fixable to the floor 15 of the passenger compart ment of a motor vehicle.The rear edge 7 of the flex ible seat squab 2 is supported by a support member 12 comprising a tubular element 13 inserted into the hole 5,and two levers 14 one of which is visible in Figure 1 each of which is fixed at one end on to the tubular element 13 and is pivoted at the opposite end on a corresponding support element 15a fixable on to the floor 15 of the passenger compartment of the motor vehicle. The seat back 3 is provided with a support structure 16 which is pivoted at the bottom on the two support ele ments 15a one of which is visible in the drawing to which the two levers 14 are connected. Two small connecting links 17 are carried, respectively, by the two support elements 1 5a. Each connecting link 17 is pivoted at one end to the corresponding lever 14 and at the other end to the support structure 16 of the seat back 3 of the seat 1. As illustrated in Figure 1, the floor 15 of the pas senger compartment of the motor vehicle on which the seat 1 is to be mounted has a flat front portion i8 disposed at a lower level than a flat rear portion 19. A single flexible covering element 20 covers the flat rear portion 19 of the floor 15 and the rear face of the seat back 3 of the seat. As illustrated in Fig ure 8, each support 11 includes a pair of plates 21 joined together by a small bridge 22 and provided, respectively, with flanges 23 by means of which they are fixable to the floor 15 of the motor vehicle. The two plates 21 are provided with holes 24 for receiving a pin 25 for the pivoting of the free end of the arms 10 of the support member 8. This end is provided with a hole 26 in which the pivot pin 25 is received. This latter is also utilised for fixing an additional member 27 to thefree .end of the arm 10. This member 27 is constituted by a channel element having,in each side wall,.holes 28 intended to receive the pin 25. The additional member 27 cooperates with the small bridge 22 of the support 11 to define an end of path position of the support member 8. The small bridge 22 functions, in fact, as a stop element for the additional member 27 which moves rigidly with the end of the arm 10.of the support member 8.Consequently, this latter can tip forwardly until it is carried into contact with the floor 15 of the passenger compartment of the motor vehicle, and can be tipped rearwardly until the additional members 27 are carried into contact with the two small bridges 22 with which the supports are provided. Each of the end arms 10 of the support member 8 has, at its free end, a flattened portion 29 which is received between the two sides of the additional members 27. With reference to Figures e to 6, each of the levers 14 forming part of the support member 12 for the rear edge 7 of the squab 2 is constituted by a pair of parallel plates 30 fixed at one end on to the tubular element 13 and pivoted at the opposite end on to the corresponding support element 15a. This latter is in the form of a curved channel having two side walls 31. Each of the side walls 31 is provided, at one end of the element 15a, with a flange 32 fixable by means of bolts 33 on to a zone of the floor 15 which interconnects the txo flat portions 18 and 19.The two side walls 31 of the channel constituting the support element 15a are further provided at the ends of the channel nearest the flanges 32 with holes 34 to receive a pin 35 for pivoting the support structure 16 of the seat back 3. The side walls 31 of the support element 15a have, moreover, at their ends opposite the holes 34, two further holes 36 to receive a pin 37 for pivoting the two plates 30 constituting the lever 14. Each of the plates 30 has at its end.opposite the tubular element 13 a hole 38 to receive the pivot pin 37, and, at an intermediate point, a hole 39 to receive a pivot pin 40 for pivoting the connecting link 17. This latter is constituted by a channel element having two side walls 41 each of which is provided at one end with a hole 42 for pivoting on the pin 40, and at the opposite end with a hole 43 for pivoting on a pin 44 carried by the support structure 16 of the seat back 3. The member 8 which supports the front edge 6 of the seat squab 2 and the member 12 which supports the rear edge of the seat squab 2 form part of a pivoted par allelogram linkage for the seat squab. This linkage is displaceable between a rest position, illustrated. in Figure 2, in which the said support members are turned forwardly, and a working position, illustrated in Figure 1, in which these support members are in their end of path positions defined by the stops 22 with which the above described supports 11 are provided. In the said rest condition the distance between the cen trawl branch 9 of the tubular element 8 and the tubular element 13 is less than the distance between these two elements in their working positions. In the rest con dition, the said flexible seat squab 2 is lowered on to the floor 15 and follows the irregularities of it. In the working condition illustrated in Figure 1, the seat squab 2 is, on the other hand, stretched taut and spaced from the floor 15 of the passenger compartment of the motor vehicle. When the seat squab 2 is located in its lowered position on the floor 15. the seat back 3 is tipped forwardly and rests on the squab 2. In this condition the seat 1 occupies a much reduced vertical height thanks to the flexibility of the squab 2.In this condition, moreover, the rear face of the seat 3 is located at the same level astthe flat portion 19 of the floor 15, so that it forms together with this portion a single load platform covered by the element 20.When the seat back 3 is disposed in its upright position, in which it can be maintained by means of fixing means of known type not illustrated which connect it to the fixed structure of the motor vehicle, the support member 8 is located in its end of path position defined by the stops 22 of the supports 11, whilst the levers 14 are maintained by the seat back 3, through the interconnecting links 17, in a position such that the squab 2 is stretched between the tubular elements 9 and 13.If the seat back 3 is located in its upright position illustrated in Figure 12 then in order to move the seat into the condition illustrated in Figure 2, it is sufficient first to cause the disengagement of the fixing means which connect the seat back 3 to the fixed structure of the motor vehicle, and secondly to cause the rotation or tipping forward of the support member 8 of the squab 2 possibly accompanied at the same time by movement of the seat back 3. When, on the other hand, it is desired to change from the condition illustrated in Figure 2 to the condition illustrated in Figure 1, it is sufficient to act on the seat back 3, causing a rotation in a clockwise sense, as viewed in Figure 2, to carry the seat squab 2 into the taut condition illustrated in Figure 1. Naturally the effects of the present model extend to other embodiments which operate in the same way by utilising the same inventive concept.
