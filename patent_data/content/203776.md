# COLORING TIME CONTROLLING LAYER

## Abstract
Disclosed herein is a coloring time controlling layer suit able for use in a temperature control indicator unit. The color ing time controlling layer is composed of a film obtained by dry ing an emulsion of a polymer containing styrene and or acrylo nitrile as constituent unit s and interposed between A a layer containing microcapsules of an oily substance and B another layer containing a substance capable of inducing coloring upon contact with the oily substance. In a preferred embodiment, the coloring time controlling layer is used for a temperature control indicator unit comprising microcapsules containing a hydrophobic organic compound having a desired melting point, a methine type dyestuff precursor and an oxidizing substance.
