V belt 1 of flexible polymeric material, in particular elastomeric material, comprising at least in the portion 2 whose ends are destined to contact the pulley, a plurality of layers 7 , each one having fibers oriented in a single direction. The layers are alternatively overlapped the ones with the fibers oriented substantially in a longitudinal direction, the others in a substantially transversal direction, the thickness s of each layer being less or at most equal to the average length 1 of the fibers present in the layer. Preferably the belt is a cogged belt 4 .
