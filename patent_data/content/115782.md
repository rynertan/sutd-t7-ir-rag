# WIRE LOOP STITCHING MACHINE HEAD WITH CAM CONTROLLED STAPLE SUPPORTER

## Abstract
A loop type wire stitching machine head includes a reciprocating drive coupled to a staple forming and driving means and to a wire feed means for feeding a length of staple wire to a holder and severing it. A bender forms the wire over the holder into a generally inverted U shaped staple. A suppor ter with a rounded projection is then inserted between the legs of the staple, and a drive bar deforms the bight portion of the staple over the projection into a curved loop portion and then drives the formed loop staple into an associated workpiece, re tracting the supporter in the process. The supporter is biased to its supporting position, and a guide plate guides its move ment to that position. A cam positively holds the supporter in its supporting position during forming of the loop portion of the staple and effects positive movement thereof partway to its retracted position after formation of the loop portion to accom modate driving of the staple.
