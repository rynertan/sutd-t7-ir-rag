# X ray tube having a rotary anode.

## Abstract
An X ray tube having a rotary anode which is accommo dated in a vacuum tight housing and is rotatably mounted by means of at least one spiral groove bearing the mutually co operating surfaces of which which consist of Mo or of an alloy of Mo and W are effectively wetted by a Ga alloy serving as a bearing lubricant. In order to extend the life of the X ray tube, the Ga alloy comprises 1 to 4 by weight of Ag and or Cu, as a result of which the formation of crystalline compounds is mitigated.
