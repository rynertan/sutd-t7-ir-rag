# Timer circuit.

## Abstract
A positive voltage supply 11, 12 is connected to a circuit having a single capacitor 14 and a depletiontype field effect transistor 20 to create a simple and reliable timer 10 . The capacitor is initially charged upon the open ing of a control switch 30 without creating a timed output across the drain source terminals 21, 22 of the field effect transistor 20 . The closing of the control switch 30 rever ses the bias of the single capacitor 14 to the gate source connections 23 22 of the field effect transistor 20 to thereby create a fixed and reliable timed interval.
