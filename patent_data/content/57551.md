# Catalyst regeneration procedure.

## Abstract
Supported multi metallic platinum containing hydrocar bon conversion catalysts which are at least partially deactivat ed due to the deposition of carbonaceous residues thereon during contact with hydrocarbons are regenerated by 1 con tacting the catalyst with oxygen to burn at least a portion of the carbonaceous residues from the catalyst, 2 contacting the carbonaceous residue depleted catalyst with hydrogen at an elevated temperature to convert a substantial portion of the non platinum component present in the catalyst to its metallic form, 3 contacting the reduced catalyst with dry hydrogen ha lide in the absence of oxygen, 4 treatment of the hydrogen halide treated catalyst with chlorine, and 5 reduction of the chlorine treated catalyst with a reducing agent, such as hydro gen.
