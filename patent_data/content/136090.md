# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO EXPRESSION PLASMIDS

## Abstract
A promoter operator Shine Dalgarno Clal containing frag ment has been obtained comprising a 10 region and a Shine Dalgarno sequence characteristic of the trp promoter operator Shine Dalgarno fragment and comprising in addition the fol lowing sequences i a 6 base pair sequence in the 35 region of the frag ment 5 3 of T A G C C G C G G C A T, and ii a sequence of about 17 base pairs between the 35 and the 10 regions of said fragment, the sequence of the first eight base pairs 5 3 being C G G C C G G C C G A T T A C G. Plasmids have been prepared comprising this promotor operator fragment and plasmids have also been prepared com prising the trp promoter operator, which are useful for the over production in bacteria of particular proteins, such as β lactamase, β interferon and interleukin 2.
