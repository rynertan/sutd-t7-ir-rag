# Metal current carrier for electrochemical cell electrodes.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a metal current carrier for use in fabricating thin electrochemical cell electrodes comprising a thin metal screen having disposed on one side a thin layer of coarse metal particles which at least partially fill the multiple openings in the metal screen and which are sintered to themselves and to the metal screen. There is also disclosed a method of fabricating such a metal current carrier and also an electrochemical cell electrode utilising such a metal current carrier.
