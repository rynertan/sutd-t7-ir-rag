# Modified aminoplast condensation products and process for their preparation.

## Abstract
Improved resins are obtained by substituting urea for part of the melamine in known cationic water soluble resins obtained by interaction of melamine, an aliphatic hydrox ymonoamine such as triethanolamine, and formaldehyde. The new resins, which have molar ratios melamine urea hydroxyamine formaldehyde in the range 1 0.25 8 0.1 2.5 4 30, have a faster curing rate and better stability in the liquid state for a given content of formaldehyde.
