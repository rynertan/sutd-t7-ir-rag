# A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MINIMIZING DIGITAL TO ANALOG CONVERTER CORRECTION TRIMS

## Abstract
A method and system for reducing the number of trims required to decrease the error function of a DAC below a specified range. The method includes the step of Walsh transforming the actual transfer characteristic of the DAC to generate a set of Walsh terms and fitting the Walsh terms to a straight line in the log domain.
