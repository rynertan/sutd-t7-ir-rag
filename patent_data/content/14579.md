# A catalytic hydrocarbon reforming process with sulfur removal.

## Abstract
A reforming process comprising contacting a sulfur con taining hydrocarbon material in at least one scavenging or sulfur removal zone 54 with at least one manganese con taining composition at conditions to remove at least a portion of said sulfur from said hydrocarbon material to produce a hydrocarbon feedstock having a reduced concentration of sulfur and contacting said hydrocarbon feedstock with a catalyst comprising, optionally a major amount of a porous solid support, a minor catalytically effective amount of at least one platinum group metal component, optionally a minor catalytically effective amount of at least one halogen component, and optionally at least one rhenium component, in the presence of hydrogen at hydrocarbon reforming conditions in a reforming zone 56 to obtain a hydrocarbon reformate product.
