## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING GRAFT COPOLYMERS The invention relates to a process of preparing a graft copolymer by reacting a polymer of an alkene 1 in an aqueous suspension with a polar monomer, in the presence of a radical initiator. The object of the invention is to provide a solution to the problem presented by the fact that in the known e.g. U.S. PatentSpecification No. 3,644,582 modification of a polyolefin, e.g.polypropylene, by reaction with a polar monomer1 e.g. acrylate monomer, in the presence of, e.g., a peroxide as radical initiator so called graft copolymerization , a reasonably acceptable degree of conversion of the monomer, is usually attended with a low degree of grafting and with the formation of an irregularly modified polyolefin. Degree of grafting is understood to mean the ratio between the number oi moles of polar monomer that is grafted onto the polyolefin during the graft copolymerization reaction and the total number of moles of polar monomer converted during this reaction.By far the greater part of the polar polymer that goes get converted but is not grafted onto the polyolefin is converted into loose polymer of the polar monomer. According to the invention, a modified polyolefin is prepared by reacting a polymer of an alkene l in an aqueous suspension with a polar monomer in the presence of a radical initiator, the process being characterized in that a substantially water insoluble radical initiator dissolved in an inert water soluble solvent is added to an aqueous suspension of the alkene polymer. The concept substantially water insoluble radical initiator is meant to express that the quantity of radical initiator added is not soluble in the quantity of aqueous liquid of the suspension used. Analogously, the concept water soluble solvent is meant to express that the quantity oi the peroxide solvent added, under the prevailing reaction conditions is soluble in the quantity of aqueous suspension agent used. In the process according to the invention a high degree of conversion of the polar monomer is combined with a particularly high degree of grafting. Consequently only a small proportion oi polar monomer is converted into unwanted loose polymer of the polar monomer. Thanks to the high degree oi grafting, the graft copolymer has, ior a given content oi units of the polar monomer, considerably improved adhesive properties to ior example e.g.fillers, plastic surfaces, metal surface, glass mats, etc. As polymer of an alkene l it is preierred to use a homopolymer of an alkene 1 with three or more, preferably 3 6, carbon atoms per molecule, a copolymer oi two or more oi such alkenes, or a copolymer oi one or more of such alkenes with ethylene.Examples are polypropylene, polybutylene 1, poly 4 methyl pentylene l , polyhexylene 1, propylene butylene 1 copolymer, ethylene propylene copolymer, and ethylene hexylene l copolymer. It is also possible to use polyethylene, preferably having a density of not more than 0.935 g cm The polymers may be crystalline, waxy, or rubbery. The copolymers may be random as well as so called block copolymers. Special preference is given to polymers oi propylene, either alone or in combination with, by preference, ethylene, ior instance homo polypropylene, statistic copolymers of propylene with not more than 5 by weight of ethylene, or block copolymers oi propylene and ethylene containing at most 20 by weight of ethylene. The polymer oi an alkene 1 is suspended in an aqueous suspension agent. The suspension agent may be water, optionally containing minor quantities oi a water miscible organic solvent.This organic solvent may be identical with the solvent for the radical initiator. Furthermore, a suspension aid may be present, which may be a surfactant, for example a synthetic soap, or particularly a polyvinyl alcohol, whether or not partly esterified with, e.g., acetic acid. Such a product can be obtained by complete or partial saponiiication of polyvinyl acetate. The polar monomer used usually comprises one or more oxygen or nitrogen functions in the molecule, including for example an ether function, an ester function, a ketone function, a carboxylic acid function, an anhydride function, an amine function, an amide function and for an imide function. The polar monomer can also be, e.g., a silane derivative. Furthermore, the molecule contains at least one ethylenic unsaturation, which is used up in the polymerization.As ethers, vinyl ethers in particular come into consideration.Suitable esters are e.g. esters of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid with aliphatic alcohols having for example 1 18 carbon atoms per molecule, and vinyl esters of carboxylic acids having for example 2 18 carbon atoms per molecule. Examples of suitable polar monomers are methacrylate esters, e.g. ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, 2 ethyl hexyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, glycidyl methacrylate and lauryl methacrylate, maleic anhydride, aminomethyl acrylate, aminomethyl methacrylate, dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, tert butyl aminoethyl methacrylate, methacrylamide, oleamide, maleimide, 2 vinyl pyridine, 4 vinyl pyridine, 2 methyl 5 vinyl pyridine, N vinyl pyrrolidone, vinyl acetate, vinyl glycidyl ether, vinyl tris 2 methoxy ethoxy silane, vinyl trimethoxy silane, vinyl trichlorosilane, and methacryloxypropyl trimethoxy silane.It is also possible to use polar monomers with two or more ethylenic unsaturations, e.g. butyleneglycol dimethacrylate, butyleneglycol diacrylate, diethyleneglycol diacrylate, ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, ethyleneglycol diacrylate, triethyleneglycol diacrylate, polyethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, polyethyleneglycol diacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, divinyl sulphone, bis allyl glycol dicarbonate, triallyl cyanurate, acetyl triallyl citrate, diallyl phthalate, tetrallyl methylenediamine, tetrallylloxyethane and 1,10decamethyleneglycol dimethacrylate. A preferred group of acrylate monomers includes theC1 C4 alkyl acrylates and methacrylates, e.g. methylacrylate, methyl methacrylate and butyl acrylate, and meth acrylonitrile. The polar monomer may either be added to the aqueous suspension before the addition of the radical initiator, or introduced during the reaction. As radical initiator may be used any suitable compound that shows suiiiciently poor solubility in the aqueous phase of the suspension and sufficiently fast release of radical under the reaction conditions. Suitable radical initiators are, for instance, organic peroxides and azo compounds. Examples of suitable peroxides are benzoyl peroxide, lauryl peroxide, tert butyl perbenzoate, dicumyl peroxide, di tert butyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, 2, 5 dimethyl 2, 5 di tert butylperoxy hexane, 2,5 dimethyl2,5 di tert butylperoxy hexyne, diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate, etc. Examples of suitable azo compounds are azodicarbonamide and azobisisobutyronitrile. The radical initiator is dissolved in a suitable inert water soluble solvent, e.g. an organic solvent, such as an alcohol with at most 12, more i particular at most 4, carbon atoms per molecule, an ester of a carboxylic acid and an alcohol each oi which has at most 6 carbon atoms per molecule, or a ketone with at most 12, preferably at most 6, carbon atoms per molecule, or a ketone with at most 12, preferably at most 6, carbon atoms per molecule. Examples oi suitable solvents are methanol, ethanol, the propanols, tert butanol, ethyl acetate, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and methyl isobutyl ketone. Other suitable solvents are ethyl butyrate, methyl valerate, methyl caproate, butyl iormiate and amyl acetate.The organic solvent may contain a subordinate quantity oi water. The reaction temperature may be, for instance, between 25 and 150 OC by preference it is 50 100 OC. The pressure is not critical, but should be such that the aqueous liquid phase is maintained. The concentration of alkene polymer in the suspension may be, e.g. 50 to 1000 g l, by preference 200 to 500 g l. lower or higher concentrations may be applied, if so desired, but they do not offer advantages. The concentration of radical initiator in the solution added to the suspension may be, e.g. 1 to 80 S by weight, preferably 5 to 25 5 wt. the quantity of radical initiator used in relation to the polar monomer may be, e.g. 0.01 to 10 wt., preferably 0.1 to 1 t0 wt.The quantity of polar monomer used in relation to the alkene polymer may be, e.g. 0,1 to 100 O wt. The modified polyolefins prepared by the process of the invention show particularly good adhesion to substrates, e.g. a polymer surface, a metal surface, a glass surface, a coat of paint, and to particles of fillers, reinforcing agents and pigments used for polyolefins, for example calcium carbonate, silica, silicic acid, mica, talc, asbestos, graphite, carbon black, carbon fibres, glass fibres, glass beads, crushed glass, gypsum, clay, alumina, aluminium hydroxide, magnesia, magnesium hydroxide, iron oxides, titania, cadmium sulphide, barium carbonate, barium sulphate, metal fibres and metal powder. They can be used as a coating on a metal or glass surface or on a surface of another polymer, in particular a polyolefin. Especially useful are laminates of unmodified polypropylene and a modified polypropylene prepared by the process of the invention. The modified polyolefins may also be used as such or in iilled, reinforced, pigmented and or metallized condition, for making objects with excellent properties. The modified polyolefins may be blended with unmodified polyolefins so as to improve the adhesive properties thereof. Of special importance are blends of a modified polypropylene prepared by the process of the invention with unmodified polypropylene. Thanks to the high degree of grafting, it suffices to blend relatively small quantities of modified polyolefin with the unmodified polyolefin, so that the cost price of the blend can remain low. The filler content of the blend is preferably between 10 and 70 5 wt., related to the blend. The weight ratio of modified to unmodified polyolefin is, for instance, 1 5 to 1 50. The invention will be further elucidated by means of the following, non restrictive, examples.
