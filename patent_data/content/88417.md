# Liquid pump using negative pressure.

## Abstract
The invention concerns an inertia type continuous dis charge liquid pump using negative pressure which is actuated manually or motored by reciprocating up and down stroke for pumping liquid, especially water, from a lower to a higher level. The pump has a casing or housing 11 connected to a suc tion pipe 27 and enclosing a lower or vacuum chamber 12 with apertures 19 closable by an elastic sleevelike valve 20, and an upper or compression chamber 13 which communicates with a vertical tube member 21 and outlet components. The upper end of the casing 11 is closed by an elastic stopper 23 tightly surrounding the tube member 21 the lower end of which car ries the vacuum chamber 12 which is separated from the sur rounding pressure chamber 13 by sealing fins 30. An air feeder valve 17 communicates with the interior of the casing below the vacuum chamber. In use, the vacuum chamber 12 contains an air pocket 18 to provide a partial vacuum. Use of the pump as portable highly efficient water pump of simple construction.

## Description
Liquid pump using negative pressure This invention relates to pumping devices in general and specifically to a continuous discharge pump by resorbed ramming. The primary object of this invention is to provide a vacuum inertia pump that works on sequential interaction of vacuum and compress ion on liquid mass by reciprocating motion. Another object of this invention is to provide a vacuum inertia pump that could be adopted and adjusted to reach the source of deeper water tables and higher delivery heads so that water can be applied to wider variety of uses. A further object of this invention is to provide a vacuum inertia pump that is simple, functional, durable, affordable and easy to manufacture. Other objects and advantages of the vacuum inertia pump will be fully comprehended in conjunction with the following detailed specification and drawings that form part of this disclosure.Fig. 1 is a centrally sectioned longitudinal view of the vacuum inertia pump showing all the numbered parts thereof.Fig. 2 is an enlarged centrally sectioned air feeder valve. Referring to the detailed drawing in fig. 1 as illustrated is the vacuum inertia pump generally designated as 10. The vacuum inertia pump 10 essentially comprises five major components the main casing 11, which is also the suction pipe and housing the vacuum chamber 12, which is also the ramming and valve section the compression chamber 13, which suitably communicates with the vertical tube member 21 and outlet components and an air feeder valve 17, details of the latter component are shown in fig 2. The vacuum chamber 12 is a cylindrical pipe fully enclosed on its upper end and flared to form a cone on its lower end and centrally disposed within the main casing 11 its function is independent from other components and it contains an air pocket 18 to provide the partial vacuum with enough resiliency for the water mass to gain distance and momentum in the suction tube when an external downward force is applied for an effective inertial ramming of water mass upon return, actuated by the vacuum. The air pocket 18 also absorbs the dampening effect of water in the instance of ramming and increases the time of water entry through the valves 20 and moderates destructive pressures.Below the air pocket 18 are multiple slots or openings 19 of any suitable size and shape that are covered to seat an elastic valve 20 fixedly attached to the lower end of the outer periphery of the vacuum chamber 12 by grooves and or screws. To avoid folding in the upper portion of the elastic valve one or more points must be anchored slightly stretched to the upper portion of the vacuum chamber 12. Below the multiple slots are one or more annular sealing fins that divide the compression chamber 13 from the vacuum chamber 12 by snagly pressing against the inner wall of the main casing 11. The valve 20 will allow passage of water through the openings 19 only when the pressures in the vacuum chamber 12 are greater than the pressures in the compression chamber 13. Disposed centrally and vertically within the compression chamber 13 is the vertical tube member 21 that connects all the vital components of the vacuum inertia pump 10. The lower end of the vertical tube member 21 which defines the beginning of the compression chamber 13 is where the vacuum chamber 12 is fixedly welded without constricting the bottom opening of the vertical tube member 21, which is provided with holes for water passage 24. The opposite end is threaded to fit a coupling 25 designed to compress and expand the rubber washer 23 circumferentially when tightened between two metal washers 22 the lower washer being welded to the vertical tube member 21. The rubber washer expands circumferentially outward of the metal washers 22 to press firmly against the upper inner wall of the main casing 11 to form an air tightly sealed compression chamber 13.To avoid damaging brittle and expansive materials used for main casing 11 like bamboo and P.V.C. a tightened metal clamp 28 on the outer circumferential surface will counter the damaging effect of outwardly expanding rubber pressure to said materials. The coupling 25 may be used only if an extension pipe 14 is needed to reach the source of water to submerge the open end of the suction pipe 27 otherwise the teejoint 26 will be sufficient and directly screwed to connect the opposedly screwed horizontal handles 15 and 15a to the outlet and extended flexible hose spout 16.A screwable cup 29 may also be used to cover the other outlet if the delivery head is too high to warrant the use of a double outlet and spout. Free air is desorbed from water under vacuum and absorbed by the water under pressure. Due to insufficient desorbed air produced by the partial vacuum in the vacuum chamber 12 to supply the air requirements in the compression chamber 13, the difference will be supplied by that passes out with the water output. Referring now intermittently to fig. 2 the enlarged detailed drawing of the feeder valve 17 an ordinary tire air valve has a valve housing 1 that is designed to air tightly fit to seal a hole bored in the main casing 11 of the vacuum inertia pump 10 mandatorily fixed lower than the vacuum chamber 12. When screwing into the housing the valve seat 6, the spring 4 and footing 2 press against the inner part of the valve housing 1 to increase the pressure of the valve 5 against the valve seat 6 along the axis of the guide rod 3 to stop the air from getting in or out in jarring use. To obtain desired re sults for our purpose as feeder valve 17, the screwable valve seat 6 must be adjusted to allow air to come in the suction pipe 27 only when the pressure reaches close to absolute. The spring 4 may also be stretched to offer more pressure against the valve seat.In this manner if the air feeder valve 17 is properly adjusted, the vacuum inertia pump will remain primed for considerable length of time and the compressed air in the compression chamber 13 will regulate the continuous outlet flow of water. To assemble, the air feeder valve 17 is pressed from the inside out to fit the hole in the main casing 11, the vacuum chamber s annular seal fins 30 are slid inside the main casing 11 that is pushed further by the vertical tube member 21 until the rubber washer 23 is aligned in the upper inner main casing 11. The teejoint 26 or the coupling 25 is tightened and the outlet components 29, 15 and 16 connected, completing the assembly of the vacuum inertia pump 10. Submerging the suction pipe 27 end in the water source and moving the vacuum inertia pump 10 up and down with jerky motion, manually or motored, vacuum is created and the water raises in the suction pipe 27, forced through the valves by ramming to the compression chamber 1 3 where the pulsating forced water together with the air is compressed into it and regulated in a forceful continuous outflow by a pressure greater than the static pressure of the outlet head. We claim 1 to have invented and constructed a vacuum inertia pump as described in the forestated specification and function that works on sequential interaction of vacuum and compressiDn on liquid mass by reciprocating motion actuated manually or motored. 2 to have invented and constructed the vacuum inertia pump as described in the specification to reach lower water levels and deliver the same to higher water levels than the normal suction heads in a continuous flow manner. 3 to have invented and constructed a vacuum inertia pump as described in the specification a simple, easy to manufacture pump assembly, all the functions of same are integrated in a single main casing. 4 to have invented and constructed a vacuum inertia pump as described in the specification the assembly of which does not require a single tool and is portable.
