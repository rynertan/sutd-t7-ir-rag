# Apparatus for adjusting individual actuating cams of a pusher conveyor.

## Abstract
A conveyor cam adjusting apparatus permitting adjust ment of the radial position of each cam 30 on a drive shaft 32 while it is rotating. A plurality of individual electric motors 44 are mounted for rotation about a common drive shaft 32 each motor 44 being associated with a single cam 30 . Each motor 44 is provided with a means 149 for manually selectively connecting it to a control means in order to enable an operator to rotate the associated cam 30 relative to the common drive shaft 32 while the shaft 32 is rotating. A sensing means 150 may be used to detect the position of each cam 30 relative to a predetermined reference position and the output of the sensing means 150 may be used by a computer control means to automatically selectively activate each motor 44 to adjust the associated cam 30 accordingly.
