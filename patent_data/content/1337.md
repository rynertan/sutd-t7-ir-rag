## Description
A wheel mounting assemblyThis invention relates to a wheel mounting assembly and more particularly but not solely to a wheel mounting assembly suitable for attaching a wheel to a semi trailer so as to permit the provision of fully independent suspension.Heavy goods semi trailers of the type which are articulated to a tractor vehicle by means of a so called fifth wheel coupling generally employ an axle which extends transversely of the chassis to support a wheel on each side of the chassis. Such configurations have employed various methods of springing but the beam axle connection between wheels prevents the provision of fully independent suspension.Fully independent suspension systems have been employed on light vehicles e.g. motor cars but none of the systems employed are commercially viable for use on heavy goods semi trailers. As far as we are aware a heavy goods semi trailer with fully independent suspension has never been produced.This invention seeks to provide a wheel mounting assembly configuration suitable for mounting wheels onto heavy goods semi trailers, in a manner which permits the provision of fully independent suspension, which contig oration is also suitable for use in other applications e.g. for light weight trailers and on vehicles themselves.The main advantage offered by the invention is the provision of a simple wheel mounting assembly which is particularly suitable for adaption to independent suspension and which can be produced in a form suitable for use with heavy goods trailers.According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a wheel mounting assembly comprising a stub axle having two pairs of arms in which the arms of each pair extend in wishbone configuration one to each of two sides of the stub axle from positions at or near opposite ends of the stub axle the free ends of the arms being adapted for pivotal mounting on a chassis.The arms are preferably permanently connected to the stub axle by for example welding.The free ends of the two arms on each side of the stub axle are preferably rigidly coupled to a common carrier member. The two carrier members may be adapted for pivotal mounting on a common axis.The arms at one end of the stub axle may be of equal length as may the arms at the other end of the stub axle.The arms mounted at the end of the stub axle which in use extends inboard of the trailer are normally shorter than the arms mounted at the opposite end of the stub axle.The invention also includes a vehicle or trailer provided with wheels each mounted by mounting assemblies as hereinbefore defined which mounting assemblies are pivotally mounted on the chassis of the vehicle or trailer by the adaption at the free ends of the arms. A vehicle or trailer may have a single longitudinally extending beam chassis with the mounting assemblies pivotally mounted on the beam by the adaption at the free ends of the armsThe wheel mounting assemblies may be sprung by any suitable resilient means acting between the wheel mounting assembly and the vehicle or trailer chassis. Preferably a fully independent resilient means is provided for each wheel mounting assembly e.g. a pressure diaphragm or bellows containing air under compression, or adapted for connection to a pressurized source e.g. a compressor on a vehicle a leaf or coil spring arrangement or rubber cones.In order that the invention and its various other preferred features may be understood more easily, an embodiment thereof will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the drawings, in which Figure t shows a wheel mounting assembly in accordance with the invention, Figure 2 is a rear elevation of a heavy goods semi trailer provided with wheel mounting assemblies constructed in accordance with the invention, Figure 3 is a side elevation of the semi trailer of Figure 2, and Figure 4 is a plan view of the semi trailer of Figures 2 and 3.The wheel mounting assembly of Figure 1 is constructed of box section tubular steel material and has a stub axle 10 for mounting a wheel by means of a hub not shown. Welded to two opposite sides of the stub axle towards the hub end are two arms 11 of equal length. The arms 11 are divergent to form a fishbone configuration. Another pair of similar but shorter arms 12 of equal length are welded to the same opposite sides of the stub axle 10 at a posiffet its th end. Again the arme are divergant to form a zecond wishbene arnfiguratioz.The ends of the arms 11 and 12 remote from the stub axle en each of the tws coposit das are welded to a raspact ive tab for reca pt o a trunn on or ful 14. The heavy goods gemi trailer of Figures 2 to 4 employs similar wheal meunting assemblies to that shown in Figure 1 but in this case made of t hular steel of cir ular ection Like parts of the wh el mounting assemblies are gives the eame reference numerals as are employed t Figure 1. The semi trailer chassis in this particular embodiment a single longitudinally extending beam 20 of the type as described in our co pending European PatentApplication entitled Improvements in or relating toTrailers filed on the me day as this Application end claiming priority from British Patent Appliction No 37225 77. the disclosure of that European PatentApplication is hereby incorporated by reference.The whael mousting assemblies are each pivotally mountes on the chassis beam 20 by means of two pairs of spaced lugs or hangers 21 which receive the trunnion or fulcrum shaft 14. The fulerum shaft 14 is provided with two projecting flanges 22 each disposed Approximately at one third of the shaft length from a respective end. These flanges serve as stops for two conical rubber and steel honded bushes 23 which have an axial hole of diameter greater than the diameter of the fulcrum shaft nd less than the outside diameter of the flanes 22 of the fuleruz shaft which extends axially therethrough. The irside the tubalar rrir 13 or alternatively the inner surface of aushes not shown located in each end of the carrier of conical form the conical section reducing in ation inwardly of the carrier and has a conical tion ilar to that or the bushes 23. The mounting assembly is secured to the hangers 21 by aligning the hole through the tubular carrier with two holes disposed oppositely and in axial alignment in the hangers 21. These holes are sufficiently large to ermit insertion of the bushes 23 therethrough re of diameter similar to the inside end diameter or. the carrier 13.The fulcrum shaft 14 is now inserted through the aligned holes in the hangers 21 and through the carrier 13.Conical bushes 23 pushed one onto each end of the fulcrum shaft are followed by a geavy metal compression washer 24 of diameter larger than the hole in the hangers 21.Each end of the fulcrum shaft is provided with a screw threaded hole into which a bolt is screwed to secure the assembly. By tightening the bolts 25 the bushes 23 are compressed sgainst the conical inside surface of the tubular carrier and provide a firm yet resilient mount which permits sufficient movement of the stub axles against a resilient suspension system as will now be described.The stub axle 10 is provided with a mounting plate 26 for securing a spring which acts between the mounting plate and a bearer 27 which extends laterally of the beam 20. The spring supports the mounting assembly and provides a resilient suspension system therefore. In the embodiment described the spring is an air spring 28 which comprises a bellows or diaphragm arrangement which is adapted to be fed with compressed air from the compressor of the brake system of a tractor vehicle.Such a system provides fully independent suspension for each wheel. Any other form of springing can be employed e.g. leaf or coil springs or rubber cones and the suspension can be independent or non independent as required.The stub axles are provided with hub and brake plate assemblies 30 and wheels 31.The air spring system employed in the illustrated embodiment may be provided with means for reducing body roll. It i8 envisaged that this could be effected by pressure cross coupling between air springs. An alternative or additional means for reducing roll would be a conventional anti roll bar and such an anti roll bar is applicable to trailers using the mounting assembly with alternative suspension systems.Although the wishbone mounting assembly described is formed as an integral unit it could be constructed in a demountable form by for example providing the carrier 13 and stub axle 10 with means for releasably securing separate art 11 and 12 for example suitable flanges could be provided. Such a construction is likely to be weaker but could be useful for constructing trailers or other vehicles for carrying light loads. In the construction illustrated the arms 11 are of equal length as are the arms 12. Although equal length arms are preferred it is envisaged that different length arms may be required for specific applications.In the embodiments described the arms II at the outer end of the stub axle 10 are joined to the inner ends of the carriers 13 and the arms 12 at the inner end of the stub axle 10 are joined to the outer ends of the carriers 13.An alternative configuration is possible in which the arms 11 are connected between the outer end of the stub axle 10 and the outer end of the carriers 13 and shorter arms 12 are connected between the inner end of the stub axle 10 and the inner ends of the carriers 13.
