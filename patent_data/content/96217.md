# CENTRIFUGE ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A continuous flow centrifuge system having a dispos able fluid container of constant cross section mounted in a circular channel. The channel, defining a separation region, has a constant height and side walls of divering spirals to increase the cross sectional area from inlet to outlet. The container expands dynamically to conform to the claimed geometry and the collection chamber is attached to the container to obtain the separated fluid fractions. The channel may be in an insert, defined between the walls of the insert and the rotor bowl or in a rotor head assembly.
