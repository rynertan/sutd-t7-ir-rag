# NARROW BAND ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC AMPLIFIER

## Abstract
A low noise, high gain differential amplifier suitable for EEG amplification is constructed in a shielded metal enclo sure, preferably on a ground plane circuit board. The amplifier is battery powered to eliminate all possibility of noise from the power system. The amplifier utilizes a pair of operational amplifiers to provide high input impedence for each of two input signals. A differential amplifier generates an internal signal which is filtered and amplified by a pair of band pass amplifiers and overlapping low pass and high pass amplifiers.
