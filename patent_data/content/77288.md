# FILL YARN, METHOD OF MANUFACTURE AND USES THEREOF

## Abstract
A fill yarn, 2, with a deformable surface is used in forming the tabby portion, 4, at the ends of rolls of tire fabric. Such usage results in reduced curtaining, webbing, splitting, and wrinkling of the fabric in areas adjacent to the tabby portion. This, in turn, results in less scrap fabric.
