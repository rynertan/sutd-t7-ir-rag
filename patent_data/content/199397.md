## Abstract
Process for the preparation of an edible fat containing product wherein a fat containing fraction a of the composi tion which is to constitute the product is cooled to cause crystallization of part of the fat and a fraction b of the composition is mixed with fraction a containing partially crystallized fat in a mixer comprising two closely spaced mutually displaceable surfaces, each having a pattern of cavities which overlap during movement of one surface with respect to the other, between which surfaces the fractions to be mixed pass, and according to a preferred embodiment 10 to 99,99 of fraction a is mixed with 90 to 0.01 of fraction b , calculated as volume on the total composition.
