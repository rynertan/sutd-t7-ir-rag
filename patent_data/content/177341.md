# CLUTCH SERVOS

## Abstract
A clutch servo for a vehicle cable operated clutch system has a housing 1 , an input member 3 to which an input force is applied by the cable 2 which has an inner cable 2a and an outer sheath 2b , an output member 4 connected to a clutch, and a movable wall 5 for augmenting the output force which acts through the output member 4 . The movable wall 5 is operated by a fluid pressure chamber 6 , pressurisation of which is controlled by valve means 8 in response to the input force. In one construction the inner cable 2a is movable relative to the movable wall 5 , and a locking means 7 is incorporated to lock the inner cable and the movable wall against relative movement when the movable wall is not in its retracted position. This ensures that the servo is not affected by adjustment of the cable to compensate for clutch lining wear when this adjustment is performed between the servo and the pedal. In another construction the servo includes adjuster means in the form of locking means 62 between the housing 1 and an end 58 of the sheath 2b , which is inoperative when the inner cable 2a is retracted to allow relative movement between the end 58 and the housing, and which operates when the inner cable 2a moves from its retracted position to lock the sheath 2b and the housing 1 against movement. A valve actuating means 9 in the form of a lever 35 70 86 is also incorporated to transmit the input force from the cable to the valve means, operation of which is controlled by the input force and an opposing force in resilient means 51, 52 70 91 .
