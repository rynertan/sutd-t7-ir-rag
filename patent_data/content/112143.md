## Description
ROTATION SENSOR FOR GYROSCOPICALLY MOUNTED ROTORThe present invention is directed to the field of remote speed sensing and more specifically to the area of monitoring the rate of rotation of a gyroscopically mounted rotor.Target tracking seekers systems, as employed in missiles, normally utilize at least one gyroscopically rotating scan member. The rate of rotation must be held constant so that a predetermined scan pattern is continuously maintained. In U.S. Patent 4,009,393, a scanner is described which employs separately driven counter rotating scan elements. One of the scan elements is driven by a rotating shaft mounted in a relatively fixed orientation. A tachometer is attached to the driven shaft in order to monitor the rotational speed thereof. The tachometer employs sensing coils positioned adjacent the rotational path of an extended shaft element and electrical wires carry the signals from the coils to an associated control circuit. Such a system is adequate where a rotating shaft rotates on a relatively stationary axis.However, if all the rotating elements are movable with three degrees of freedom, such as the elements which make up the scanning system described in copending European Application No. 82305515.7, then a conventional tachometer would be impractical. The rigidity and mass of electrical wire connectio ns between a gimbal mounted rotation sensor and an associated circuit would cause additional loading to the gimbal rings and degrade the responsiveness of the tracker.According to the invention we provide a system for monitoring rotation of a gyroscopic rotor characterised by a light source remotely mounted with respect to said rotor, light reflecting means on said rotor, a light detector mounted adjacent said light source fiber optic means mounted to transmit light from said light source to said light reflecting means and to transmit reflected light from said reflecting means to said light detector, wherein said fiber optics means has one end attached to said remote location adjacent said light source and said light detector and a second end optically exposed to said reflecting means.The fiber optic means may be a single fiber optic routed through the bearing centres of inner and outer gimbal rings in order to minimise loading and imbalance to the highly sensitive gimballed elements.The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is an elevational view of a first embodiment of the present invention Figure 2 is a cross sectional view along the line Il Il of Figure 1 illustrating the routing of the fiber optic in the first embodiment Figure 3 illustrates a second embodiment of the present invention employing a discontinuous fiber optic element and Figure 4 is a detailed drawing of the lens formed at opposing ends of the discontinuous element in the second embodiment.A gyroscope 10 includes relatively fixed reference support 12 from which a pair of rigid arms 14 and 16 extend. At the outer end of each of the arms 14 and 16, concentric apertures are formed for containing concentric outer gimbal ring bearings 18 and 20 respectively.An outer gimbal ring 22 is pivotally mounted within the bearings 18 and 20 for low friction movement about an axis defined by the bearings 18 and 20. The outer gimbal ring 22 contains oppositely disposed inner gimbal support arms 24 and 26 for containing concentric inner gimbal bearings 32 and 34, respectively. An inner gimbal 36 is pivotally mounted within bearings 32 and 34 for low friction movement about an axis which is orthogonal to the outer gimbal bearing axis.The inner gimbal 36 provides a low friction mount for a rotor shaft 38 that rotates about an axis which is orthogonal to and intersects both the inner and outer gimbal axes. The rotor shaft 38 supports a gyroscopic rotor 40, which is driven in a conventional manner not shown at a controlled speed.A key element in controlling the speed of rotation of a gyroscopic rotor is a sensor for monitoring the actual speed of rotation of the rotor. The presently described embodiment utilizes a remote sensing technique that employs a transmission medium, between the rotor shaft and remotely placed sensing elements that has a very low mass and low resistance to gimbal movement within the gyroscope 10.The transmission medium employed in the present invention is a single fiber optic 50. The fiber optic 50 is routed from a stationary platform, such as rigid arm 14, through an aperture 21 concentrically located with respect to an outer gimbal bearing 18. The fiber optic 50 extends outwardly through an aperture 30, formed in gimbal ring 22, and then through the inner gimbal bearing 32, so as to have an end 52 adjacent the rotor shaft 38. The end 52 is fixed relative to the outer gimbal ring 22 but, by virtue of its alignment with the axis of inner gimbal bearing 32, maintains its functional relationship with the rotor irrespective of rotation of the inner gimbal ring relative to the outer gimbal ring. A retroreflecting mirrored surface 35 is formed on the rotor shaft 38 so that light transmitted through the fiber optic 50 and emitted from the end 52 towards the rotor shaft 38 will be reflected back into the fiber optic at least once per each revolution. Of course, several types of retroreflectors may be employed on the rotor shaft 38. The flat mirror surface 35 is but one of several contrasting surface configurations. Other configurations may include a miniature corner reflector mounted on the circular surface so as to pass near to the end 52 once for each revolution, or an aperture formed through the shaft 38 so that once per each revolution, it is in alignment with the fiber optic 50 and will create high absorption rather than high reflectance of the light emanating from the end 52.The secured end 54 of the fiber optic 50 is rigidly mounted with respect to a lens system comprising lenses 62 and 66, which are disposed so as to have a common focal point P coincident with the end surface 54 of the fiber optic 50. The lens 62 is associated with a light source 64 and lens 66 is associated with light detector 68. In operation, light source 64 emits light energy radiation towards lens 62. The light energy is focused by the lens 62 at P onto the end 54 of the fiber optic 50. The light energy is transmitted through the fiber optic 50 is emitted from the end 52 and is either absorbed or relected from the shaft 38 depending upon the instantaneous rotational position of the shaft. Once for each revolution, a light energy pulse is retroreflected back through the end 52 of the fiber optic 50 and is emitted from the end 54. Such a reflected light energy pulse is focused by the lens 66 onto the light detector 68 which responsively provides an electrical output to an associated circuit for monitoring the speed of rotation of the gyroscopic rotor. Due to the low mass of the fiber optic 50, the resistance to torque and balance effects on this miniaturized gimballed unit are negligible.An alternative embodiment of the invention is shown inFigures 3 and 4 and may be considered in those instances wherein even the low torque resistance offered by the fiber optic 50 of the first embodiment may influence or hinder movement of the gimbal rings.The second embodiment utilizes a discontinuous fiber optic strand which is shown in Figure 3 as a first section 50 and a second section 50 . The discontinuous end portions of sections 50 and 50 are contained within a non rotating conduit tube 55 which provides alignment between the discontinuous end portions. In this second embodiment, the end portions to be oppositely disposed within the conduit 55 are each formed to have an enlarged spherical surface conically joined to the original diameter of the fiber optic. The spherical ends 51 and 53 are formed by melting the fiber optic material within a spherical end mould and, when properly formed, function as optical lenses to focus transmitted light energy onto each other. In this second embodiment, the fiber optic 50 is maintained stationary while the fiber optic 50 is movable within the outer gimbal ring 22, within the outer gimbal bearing 18. Due to the discontinuous nature of the fiber, the already low torque resistance of the speed sensing system is reduced even further. Light will still be transmitted, as in the first embodiment.
