# Armoured submarine cable.

## Abstract
This invention relates to armoured submarine power cables. These cables are designed for laying in waters with varying depths. The cable will be designed with an armour which is heavy and strong steel wires 10 in shallow water section 3, 5 . In very deep waters the weight of steel armour is prohibitive so that in these sections 4 the armour is made of synthetic light weight material 11 . The transitions between the two types of armour are made physically concentrated but flexible enough to prevent sharp bends of the cable core as it passes cable laying machin ery. The armour joint may be displaced from cable core joints and should effectively transfer all longitudinal strain in the cable.
