## Description
The present invention relates to a process for making a stable pharmaceutical preparation of prostaglandin E compounds and or 15R forms thereof. Prostaglandin E compounds and 15R forms thereof hereunder abbreviated as PGEs exhibit pharmacological actions such as the inhibition of gastric acid secretion, contraction of smooth muscle and the inhibition of blood platelet aggregation even if they are present in very small amounts. However, PGEs are extremely unstable and inconvenient to handle and, hence, present considerable difficulty in application for routine clinical purposes. Several methods have, therefore, been proposed for stabilizing PGEs and they include dissolving or mixing PGEs in or with middle chain aliphatic acid triglycerides JP A 20304 1982 dissolving PGEs in alkylene glycols or monoesters thereof JP A 139716 1978 dissolving PGEs in tertiary alcohols of 4 10 carbon atoms JP A 145515 1975 and dissolving PGEs in vegetable oils and or acid esters JP A 105815 1975 . The PGEs thus stabilized by being dissolved or suspended in selected solvents or dispersion media are seldom applied directly to the patient and generally are used for clinical purposes after being formulated in certain dosage forms that can be administered and carried easily. In many cases, PGEs are formulated as soft capsules that are the most commonly used liquid fillable dosage forms in terms of ease of administration and carrying. The problem, however, is that PGEs stabilized by selected solvents or dispersion mediums often lose their stability in soft capsules. The reason for this phenomenon has not been completely elucidated and, instead, various techniques are currently employed with a view to ensuring the stability of PGEs in soft capsules. For example, in order to ensure complete moistureproofing, expensive packaging efforts are made, or the product is transported or stored cold, or the patient is instructed to always keep the drug in a refrigerator. These practices impose considerable burden on both the manufacturer and the user but have not met with much success in stabilizing PGEs. The present inventors have, therefore, made various studies in order to solve this problem, and found that by filling solutions or dispersions of PGEs not in soft capsules but in hard capsules, the stability of PGEs is significantly improved to such a level that the drug can be handled and stored at room temperature. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of this finding. The present invention relates to a process for producing a stable pharmaceutical preparation of prostaglandin E compounds and or 15R forms thereof by filling a hard capsule with a solution or a suspension of at least one prostaglandin E compound, and or a 15R form thereof, wherein the solvent or dispersant is restricted to a middle chain triglyceride, glyceryl triacetate or a vegetable oil. Any hard capsule that complies with the specifications set forth in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia may be used in the present invention. if desired, an enteric hard capsule such as shown in Japanese Patent Public Disclosure No. 42819 1974 may also be used. After filling with the solution or suspension containing the active ingredient, the cap and body of the hard capsule is desirably sealed with gelatin or other suitable materials in order to prevent leakage of the liquid contents. Prostaglandin E compounds that may be used as the active ingredient in the present invention include prostaglandin E₁ hereunder abbreviated as PGE₁ , prostaglandin E₂ hereunder PGE₂ , 13,14 dihydro PGE₁, 13,14 dihydro PGE₂, 15 methyl PGE₁, 15 methyl PGE₂, 15 methyl 13,14 dihydro PGE₁, 15 methyl 13,14 dihydro PGE₂, 16 metyl PGE₁, 16 methyl PGE₂, 16 methyl 13,14 dihydro PGE₁, 16 methyl 13,14 dihydro PGE₂, 17 methyl PGE₁, 17 methyl PGE₂, 15,16 dimethyl PGE₁, 15,16 dimethyl PGE₂, 16 phenyl ω trinol PGE₁, 16 phenyl ω trinol PGE₂, 16 phenyl ω trinol 13,14 dihydro PGE₁, 16 phenyl ω trinol 13,14 dihydro PGE₂, 16 cyclohexyl ω trinol PGE₁, 16 cyclohexyl ω trinol PGE₂, 16 cyclohexyl ω trinol 13,14 dihydro PGE₁, and 16 cyclohexyl ω trinol 13,14 dihydro PGE₂, as well as esters and 15R forms thereof. Any solvent or dispersant that is capable of dissolving or dispersing the prostaglandin E compounds listed above and which also is capable of stabilizing the latter may be employed. However, such solvent or dispersant should not interact with the capsule shell to change its properties. Suitable solvents and dispersants are middle chain triglyceride, glyceryl triacetate, as well as vegetable oils such as peanut oil and sesame oil. Although the concentration of PGEs in the solution or the suspension may vary broadly a concentration ranging from 0.1 mg ml to 100 mg ml is usually used. The utility of the present invention will become apparent by reading the following non limiting Experiment and Examples. Prostaglandin E compounds each weighing 10 mg were dissolved in tricaprylin or glyceryl triacetate to make a total of 100 g. The solution was divided into portions each weighing 100 mg and charged into soft and hard capsules. The stability characteristics of the resulting PGE capsule preparations are shown in Table 1 below. Each soft capsule shell was composed of 63 gelatin, 29.61 glycerin, 7 purified water, 0.23 methylparaben and 0.06 propylparaben. Capsule No. 4 shown in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia was used as each of the hard capsules. The percent of active ingredient remained in each capsule after standing at 40 The present invention is to be illustrated, but by no means limited, by the following examples. Ten milligrams of PGE₁ was dissolved in tricaprylin to make a total of 100 g. The solution was divided into portions each weighing 150 mg, which were charged into hard capsules No. 4 in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia . The cap and body of each capsule was sealed with gelatin. Stable PGE preparations were prepared as in Example 1 using the active ingredients, solvents or dispersants and hard capsule listed in Table 2.
