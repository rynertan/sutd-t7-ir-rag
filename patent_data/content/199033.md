## Description
This invention relates to a new process for producing natural heparan sulphate and dermatan sulphate in substantially pure form, and their pharmaceutical use. More particularly, the invention relates to a process for producing heparan sulphate and dermatan sulphate from mixtures of proteoglycans of animal tissues from the aorta, myocardium and particularly vascularised organs, based on eliminating the protein component of the proteoglycans by mild treatment which enables the structure of the two mucopolysaccharides to be integrally maintained. This process offers doubtless advantages over processes of the known art in that it enables heparan sulphates and dermatan sulphates to be obtained in a substantially pure form, ie not contaminated with other mucopolysaccharide families, it avoids any chemical or enzymatic degradation of the products themselves, and can also be easily transferred to industrial production. The mucopolysaccharides, which are widely distributed in the various centres of the body, are costituted by heterogeneous macromolecule complexes, and have structures and pharmacological profiles which differ substantially according to the role which they are called on to perform. Variations in the structure, and consequently in the pharmacological profile, are often induced by the chemical and enzymatic treatment used for their industrial purification in accordance with known processes. Heparan sulphate and dermatan sulphate are generally obtained from a mucopolysaccharide mixture constituting a by product of heparin processing. The long series of chemical and enzymatic treatment, precipitation, fractionation necessary for recovering the heparins and eliminating their contaminants always leads to a degradation of the heparan sulphate and dermatan sulphate structures with consequent variation in the pharmacological profile, in relation to the fractionation and purification method used. The different characteristics of heparin depending on the raw materials and the methods used for the preparation is clearly apparent from Merck Index 10th Edition pages 672 and 673 and from Römpps Chemie Lexicon, 1976, pages 893 and 1450. Because of the fact that the mucopolysaccharides situated in the aorta, in the myocardium and in the particularly vascularised organs are delegated to coagulative hemeostasis a process such as that of the present invention, which is suitable for their extraction from said organs while preserving their natural structure unaltered, is of particular importance. The process according to the present invention avoids reactions for releasing the mucopolysaccharides at 55 C by means of proteolytic enzymes, it also avoids heating to 100 C for coagulating the proteins and further avoids complexing by means of quaternary ammonium salts. Thus in practice, those stages which subject the materials to treatment which denatures the delicate structure of these compounds are avoided. The process for producing natural heparan sulphate and dermatan sulphate not contaminated with other mucopolysacchardies families from mixtures of proteoglycans of animal tissues from the aorta, myocardium and particularly vascularised organs, in accordance with the present invention, comprises the following stages These and further characteristics of the process according to the invention, and of the products obtained will be more apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter which relates to preferred methods for implementing the process and to the pharmacological trials. The process consists of two operational cycles in a first cycle, starting from the raw material, a crude product is produced constituted by a mixture of mucopolysaccharides in the second cycle, this is fractionated, and the individual mucopolysaccharides are purified. The raw materials used in the process consist in swine tissues comprising aorta, myocardium and particularly vascularised organs, which are finely micronized. Apart a demineralized water solution containing from 0,5 to 2 by weight of sodium acetate, from 0,5 to 1 by weight of sodium salt of EDTA and from 20 to 35 by weight of urea is prepared and in said solution the micronized product is suspended with a ratio of said solution to said micronized product form 2 and 4 by weight. The obtained suspension is stirred at room temperatura for a period of from 15 to 50 hours with the purpose of obtaining the extraction of the proteoglycans. Aternatively guanidine, thiourea and potassium thiocyanate can be employed in the place of the urea. Said suspension is filtered through a rotary filter to give an opale scent liquid which is subjected to ultrafiltration through tubular membranes in order to partially eliminate the urea. The solution is repeatedly washed with demineralised water, and ultrafiltered until the urea content is less than 5 by weight. The proteins are then precipitated by adding trichloracetic acid at a concentration of between 3 and 6 by weight, and are then separated by filtration in a filter press. The nucleic acid traces are then eliminated by treatment with activated earths in a quantity of between 2 and 5 by weight with respect to the solution, at a pH of between 3 and 4, under agitation at ambient temperature for 2 hours. The solids are separated by filtration in a filter press, the pH is adjusted to between 5 and 6 by adding a NaOH solution, and the mucopolysaccharides are precipitated by adding alcohols or ketones such as methanol, ethanol or acetone, in a volumetric ratio of between 0.8 1 and 1.2 1 with respect to the solution. On filtration, the crude product is obtained consisting of mucopolysaccharides having the following average composition on a dry basis Crude product fractionation and purification of the individual mucopolysaccharides are effected by the following operations. The crude product is dissolved in demineralised water of a quantity such as to obtain a solution of between 1 and 3 by weight, and the solution thus obtained is treated with cationic resins and then neutralised by adding calcium hydroxide. Acetone is added to obtain the fractional precipitation of the individual mucopolysaccharides in the following manner at an acetone concentration of 30 by volume, the dermatan sulphate precipitates and is separated by filtration on further increasing the acetone concentration in the solution up to 50 by volume , the heparan sulphate precipitates. The two precipitates are each separately redissolved in a 2 M sodium chloride solution of a quantity such as to attain a concentration of between 3 and 7 by weight in said solution. The solutions obtained are clarified by filtration and the respective mucopolysaccharides are precipitated by methanol in a volumetric ratio of between 0.8 2 with respect to the solutions. The products obtained are finally lyophilised. The products obtained by the process according to the present invention have the following characteristics These products, when administered either orally or parenterally to human being affected by thrombogenic forms, show the following main pharmacodynamic characteristics The pharmacological profile of heparan sulphate and dermatan sulphate obtained by the process of the present invention, and the pharmacological interactions between the two substances, were evaluated in vivo on voluntuary patients of both sexes between 45 and 70 years old, affected by thrombogenic illnesses of venous nature thrombophlebitis, varicophlebitis etc. and of arterial nature microangiopathy . The products were administered both orally and parenterally in a single administration at various dosage levels, and the interactions with the coagulative and fibrinolytic processes were evaluated at various times. Having noted that the products have qualitatively the same dosedependent pharmacological profile both for parenteral and oral adinistration, the data given hereinafter are those obtained for the maximum tested intramuscular dose, which best allows characterisation of the interactions between the individual compounds or their association, and the coagulative and fibrinolytic processes. The trial was conducted using the individual products, namely heparan sulphate and dermatan sulphate, and also an equal weight association of heparan sulphate with dermatan sulphate. The association of heparan sulphate with dermatan sulphate was chosen at equal weight because preliminary tests had shown that this best underlined the positive interactions between the two substances complementary effects on coagulation, and activation of the fibrinolytic effect of heparan sulphate by the dermatan sulphate . The administration details and the results obtained are given in the following tables The aforesaid data show that pure heparan sulphate and dermatan sulphate, when obtained in accordance with the process of the present invention in the absence of drastic treatment and thus able to preserve the natural structure of the two polysaccharides, possess the following pharmacological properties It can therefore be stated that the heparan sulphate obtained in accordance with the invention possesses essentially fibrinolytic and antithrombin III activation properties without interfering with the pharmacological properties of the dermatan sulphate. This latter acts significantly in inhibiting Factor Xa probably via heparin cofactor II activation , without significantly altering the coagulation time, while surprisingly activating the fibrinolytic effects of the heparan sulphate. Preliminary repeated treatment tests, both oral at doses of between 75 and 600 mg day and intramuscular at doses of between 50 and 400 mg day, confirm the above results, and in particular demonstrate not only the absence of significant side effects but also the presence of the following effects 1000 Kg of aorta, myocardium tissues and considerably vascularised organs of mammal origin are finely micronised and treated for 24 hours under agitation at ambient temperature with a solution formed from 2000 litres of demineralised water, 20 Kg of sodium acetate, 10 Kg of EDTA sodium salt and 700 Kg of urea. The mixture obtained is filtered through a rotary filter, and the clear liquid is ultrafiltered through tubular membranes and concentrated to about 200 litres. The liquid is then diluted with 200 litres of demineralised water and is then ultrafiltered and concentrated to 200 litres. This diluition with demineralised water, ultrafiltration and concentration is repeated a further two times in order to obtain a solution with a urea content of less than 5 by weight. Sodium chloride is added to a concentration of 2 M, and the mixture kept under agitation for 8 hours at ambient temperature. 40 litres of a 20 weight trichloroacetic acid solution is added, and the proteins which precipitate are filtered off by means of a filter press. 6 Kg of activated earths are added, the pH is adjusted to 4, the mixture kept under agitation for 2 hours at ambient temperature, and then filtered by means of a filter press. The solution pH is adjusted to 5.5 by adding KOH, and like parts by volume of metanol are added to precipitate 0.500 Kg of a mucopolysaccharide mixture having the following average composition This mixture is dissolved in demineralised water of a quantity such as to obtain a solution of 2 weight concentration, which is treated with cationic resins and neutralised with calcium hydroxide, after which acetone is added to a concentration of 30 by volume. The dermatan sulphate precipitates in this manner, and is recovered by decantation and filtration. Acetone is further added to the liquid to a concentration of 50 by volume, to precipiate the heparan sulphate which is recovered by decantation and filtration. The two products are further treated, each separately in the following manner The two products are finally lyophilised, to thus obtain 240 g of heparan sulphate and 150 g of dermatan sulphate in lyophilised form.
