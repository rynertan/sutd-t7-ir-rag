# Thick film resistor composition.

## Abstract
Thick film resistors, based on pyrochlore conductive phase, glass, and refractory fillers having a thermal ex pansion coefficient range of 40 10 ⁷ 60 10 ⁷ C and low solubility in the glass, are provided. Such thick film resistor pastes afford resistors having excellent stability to mechanical or thermal stresses.
