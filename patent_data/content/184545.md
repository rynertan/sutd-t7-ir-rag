# Method for testing gas diffusion and apparatus for same.

## Abstract
Method for testing a gas diffusion by rotatably disposing a topography model in the wind passage of a wind tunnel previously establishing a time distribution of a direction and a velocity of a wind blowing above the topography model rotating the topography model on the basis of the estab lished time distribution of the blowing wind discharging a tracer gas from a certain position of the topograph model while changing the wind velocity in the wind tunnel and testing a diffusion of the tracer gas.
