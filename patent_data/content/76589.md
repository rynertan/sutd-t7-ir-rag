# Dual mode control lever assembly.

## Abstract
A housing 12, 14 has a pivot member 20 rotatably mounted therein on a pivot pin 16 . A pair of members 38, 40 are pivotally mounted on the pivot pin 16 adjacent opposite sides of the pivot member 20 . The first member 38 is frictionally coupled 48,52,54 to the housing. The other member 40 is biased to a neutral position by a centering spring 66, 68 . A cross arm 74, 75 movable in the pivot member 20 to alternately couple and uncouple one or the other of the said pair of members 38, 40 from the pivot member, depending upon the energization state of a mode select solenoid 24 . A detent follower releasably holds the pivot member in a displaced position when in the spring centered mode. A rotary potentiometer coupled to the pivot member generates an electrical signal representing the position of the pivot member 20 and a lever handle 26 attached thereto.
