## Description
An apparatus for measuring the gas concentration of a gas containing liquid. The invention relates to an apparatus for measuring the gas concentration of a gas containing liquid, comprising a first chamber having a supply opening through which said chamber can be filled with the liquid to be analysed. Although the apparatus according to the invention can be used for measuring the gas concentration of gascontaining liquids, the invention is directed in particular to the measurement of the C02 content of beer.The invention will therefore be described hereinafter for measuring the C02 content of beer, without being restricted thereto. In the manufacture of beer it is highly important for the COz content of the beer to be kept at the proper value. In case the CO2 content is too low, the refreshing effect of the beer is lost, while an excessive CO2 content is undesirable as well. Various apparatuses for measuring the CO2 content of beer are already known, and the operation of these prior art apparatuses is based onHenry s Law, which is worded as follows At a constant temperature, the mass of a gas dissolved in a given solvent volume, is directly proportional to the partial pressure of this gas surmounting the liquid. Henry s Law applies only to a closed system and if there is an equilibrium between the gas in the liquid and the gas surmounting the liquid.Henry s equation can be written in symbols as follows m f.p T constant wherein m mass of the gas V volume of the solvent f Henry s constant p pressure of the gas surmounting the liquid T temperature in OK, m The gas concentration c In the prior art apparatus for measuring the CO2 content of beer, a system for taking a beer sample to be analysed is known wherein a sample to be analysed is taken by means of diffusion through membranes. A drawback going with this system is that it is highly vulnerable and is not satisfactory under the heavy operating conditions prevailing in breweries. Dutch patent application 267,744 describes a system for measuring the CO2 content of beer, in which the main conduit for the beer accommodates a branch wherein there is positioned a pump which transports a quantity of beer to be analysed from the main conduit to a chamber.It has been found in practice that the pump constitutes a source of disturbances, while a further drawback is that the pump consumes energy. Therefore, it is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus for measuring the CO2 content of beer, which has a simple construction, can be installed in an existing beer line in a simple manner, consumes a minimum quantity of energy and is very reliable in operation. To this end, the invention provides an apparatus of the above described type wherein the first chamber contains a first piston provided at the top with a recess in the body of the piston, and being in contact with the sidewalls of the chamber, and a second piston in the recess in the body of the first piston which is in contact with the sidewall of said recess, a resilient member being provided between the bottom of the recess and the bottom of the second piston, there being arranged means for moving the first piston in the first chamber, and means for moving the second piston relatively to the first piston,. against the forces of the resilient member As will be explained in more detail in the following, after the first chamber has been filled with beer and the supply opening has been closed, by movement of the second piston in said first chamber, a space can be formed through which gas from the liquid can escape, which space will be referred to in the following as the gas volume.After the gas volume has been formed, it is necessary for the determination of the CO2 content of the beer by means of Henry s Law, that an equilibrium is effected between the gas in the liquid and the gas in the space. surmounting the liquid. When. this equilibrium. exists., the C02 concentration can be determined by measuring the equilibrium pressure and by measuring the temperature of the beer. Since the equilibrium in aqueous liquids, such as beer, is established only very slowly, it is desirable to accelerate the formation of this equilibrium in the first place so that one may be sure that full equilibrium has actually been brought about and in the second place so that the measurement may not be too time consuming. Dutch patent application 267,744 already proposes to accelerate the formation of the equilibrium between the gas in the beer and the gas in the surmounting gas volume by installing a pair of electrodes in the beer to be analysed, with a potential difference being applied therebetween.Due to the occurring electrolysis, gas bubbles are formed on the electrodes. that rise in the beer and which form nuclei for the C02 gas separating from the beer. It has been found that an equilibrium between the gas in the beer and the gas in the gas volume can thus be quickly realised. When the equilibrium has been effected, the CO2 content of the beer can be calculated e.g. by using the apparatus and the method described in Dutch patent application 7701200. One embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawing wherein the figure is a cross sectional view of the apparatus.The figure shows a conduit 1 traversed by the beer to be analysed.To the sidewall of conduit 1 there is attached a hollow measuring cylinder 2 communicating with the conduit 1.The connection between the measuring cylinder 2 and the conduit 1 can be shut off by a valve 3 mounted on one end of a piston rod 4. To the other end of said piston rod there is attached in a chamber 6 a piston 5 adapted for movement in chamber 6. Chamber 6 is disposed on the wall of conduit 1 opposite the measuring cylinder. Between the rear wall of chamber 6 and piston 5 there is provided a compression spring 7 which, in rest, causes the valve 3 to shut off the. connection between conduit. 1 and the interior of measuring cylinder 2.. An opening for supplying. pressurized medium is arranged.in the sidewall of chamber 6 between the front wall of the chamber disposed adjacent conduit 1 and the front of piston 5, under the influence.of which the piston 5 can be moved against the force. of spring. 7 for clearing the connection between conduit 1 and measuring cylinder 2. The hollow measuring cylinder 2 comprises a first chamber 9 and a second chamber 10, which is.essentially co extensive with the first chamber. Chambers 9 and 10 are entirely separated from one another by a partition. Chamber 9 accommodates a piston 11 contacting the wall of said chamber. The top of piston 11 comprises a recessed central portion wherein a second piston 12 is placed. Between the bottom of piston 12 and the bottom of the recessed central portion in piston 11, there is arranged a compression spring 13 pressing piston 12 from the central portion upwardly. The second chamber 10 of the measuring cylinder accommodates a piston 14 connected to piston 12 by means of a piston rod 15. Piston rod 15 is thinner at the end connected to piston 12 than along the major part of the length thereof, so that adjacent piston 11, at the location where the piston rod 15 is passed through an opening 16 in piston 11, there is formed a stop which abuts against the lower surface of piston 11, thus preventing piston 12 from being entirely pressed out of the central portion of piston 11 under the influence of spring 13. At the rear of chamber 9, there is formed a stop against which piston 11 abuts in its lower position. Piston 14 has then not yet reached its lowermost position and when piston 14 is moved further downwards, in a manner described hereinafter, piston 12 will move downwardly in the recess in piston 11 against the force of spring 13. A temperature gauge 17 is positioned in conduit 1, while adjacent the connection between conduit 1 and chamber 9 there is provided. a conduit 18 connected to a pressure gauge 19. Finally, adjacent the front wall of chamber 10 there is arranged a supply opening 20 for a fluid under pressure and adjacent the rear wall of chamber 10, under piston 14, there is also provided a. supply opening 21 for a fluid under pressure. As will be further described in the following, the piston 11 and the piston rod 15 are made preferably of an electrically insulating material. The circumferential surfaces of the various pistons, just as the passageways for the piston rods, are fitted with suitable, known per se sealing means, ensuring a proper seal between the various spaces and a proper operation of the pistons. The operation of the apparatus is as. follows. The starting point is the situation in which chamber 9 is filled with beer of a preceding measurement, with piston 11 abutting against stop 22 and piston 12 being in its lowermost position relative to piston 11, into which position piston 12 has been brought,against the force of spring 13, by piston 14, which is also in its lowermost position. Valve 3 shuts off the connection between conduit 1 and chamber 9. Subsequently, a new sample to be analysed is taken from the beer in conduit 1 by pressurizing opening 8 so that piston 5 is moved against the force of spring 7, and valve 3 clears the connection between conduit 1 and chamber 9. Also opening 21 is pressurized, so that piston 14 moves to the front wall of chamber 10, when first piston 12 is brought to its uppermost position relative to piston 11 and subsequently, when the thickened portion of piston rod 15. abuts against the bottom of piston 11, the combination of the pistons 11 and 12 is moved to the front wall of chamber 9, with the preceding beer sample from chamber 9 being returned to conduit 1. After the combination of pistons 11 and 12 has reached its uppermost position, the supply opening 21 is cleared.By the pressure of the beer in conduit 1, the pistôn combination 11, 12 is again moved backwards in chamber 9, with beer flowing into chamber 9. The spring 13 is so strong that piston 12 does not move relatively to piston 11 under the influence of the beer flowing into chamber 9. When piston 11 abuts against stop 22, the entire chamber 9 is filled with beer and the supply opening 8 is cleared with valve 3, under the influence of spring 7, shuting off the connection between chamber 9 and conduit 1. Subsequently, a gas volume is formed in chamber 9 by pressurizing supply opening 20. This pressure is so high that the force of spring 13 is overcome by means of piston 14 and piston rod 15, thereby moving piston 12 downwardly in the recess in piston 11. When piston 14 abuts against the rear wall of. chamber 10, piston 72 cannot bye moved further and a space is formed in chamber 9 in a simple manner to which the CO2 present in the beer can escape. As described in the above, piston 11 and piston rod 15 are made preferably of an electrically insulating material.This makes it possible to apply a potential difference between the piston 12 and the wall of chamber 9, both made of an electrically insulating material. Chamber 9 is normally connected to the ground potential. By applying the potential difference, there is rapidly produced, under the influence of electrolysis, a gas equilibrium between the CO2 surmounting the beer and the CO2 in the beer. Finally, the pressure of the gas surmounting the beer can be measured with the pressure gauge 19 and the temperature of the beer with thermometer 17, with the temperature difference between the beer sample in chamber 9 and the beer in conduit 1 being zero or negligible small. When the relation between Henry s constant and the temperature for the specific system is known, it is possible to determine theCO2 content from the values measured, e.g. by using the apparatus and the process described in Dutch patent application 7701200 or e.g. by means of a process computer. It will be clear that the apparatus according to the invention offers a simple, reliable and relatively inexpensive possibility of determining the gas concentration of a gascontaining liquid, in particular the CO2 concentration of beer, said apparatus being readily adaptable to existing beer conduits. A great many modifications obvious to those skilled in the art are possible within the scope of the invention which, however, also fall within the scope of the invention as defined in. the claims.
