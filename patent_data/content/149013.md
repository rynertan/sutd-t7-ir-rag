## Description
TRANSMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM INCLUDING VEHICLE SPEED RESPONSIVE ORIFICE VALVE WHICH MODIFIES FRICTION ELEMENT ENGAGEMENT RATEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invent ion The present invention relates generally to an automatic automotive transmission hydraulic control system and more specifically to a system which includes an orifice valve which modifies the rate at which a friction element is engaged. Description of the Prior Art In previously .proposed transmission control systems it has been proposed to use a hydraulic fluid accumulator to attenuate shift shock and the like. An example of such an accumulator is disclosed inMaintenance manual for Nissan OD built in type automatic transmissions L4N71B and E4N7lB, Accumulator valve, pp 46 47, November 1982 However, in the case that an accumulator of the above nature is used in conjunction with a friction element which is engaged during a downshift, such as 4 3 downshift, a drawback has been encountered in that an orifice which is associated with the accumulator arrangement provides an essentially constant orifice effect irrespective of the vehicle speed.This induces the problem that when a transmission is coupled with an engine equipped with a turbocharger, due to the influence of the turbocharger the rate at which the engine speed increases at high,engine,speeds is higher than the rate at which the engine .speed decreases at low speeds whereby, as the rate of engagement of the transmission friction element is maintained essentially constant by the constant orifice effect, the time required to engage the friction element tends to be excessively long during high vehicle speed downshifting and thus permit the engine to race to the degree that the engine speed exceeds the value appropriate for the giv n downshift. SUMMARY OF .THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a simple valve arrangement via which friction element engagement can be modified to eliminate shift shock particular during downshifting at relatively high vehicle speeds in a transmission associated with a engine wherein the rate at which the engine speed increases at high engine speeds exceeds the rate at which the engine speed decreases at low speeds. In brief, the above object is fullfilled by an arrangement wherein in order to increase the rate at which a friction element is engaged during a downshift at high vehicle speeds in a multi forward speed automatic automotive transmission which is associated with a turbocharged engine or the like, an orifice valve is arranged to be responsive to a vehicle speed signal e.g governor pressure in a manner to establish a second fluid path between a the friction element e.g. clutch and an accumulator associated therewith and b the valve e.g. 3 4 shift valve which supplys the actuating pressurized hydraulic fluid and therefore reduce the flow restriction between the shift valve and the friction e2ement when the vehicle. is speed is above a prede termined value. More specificallg, the present invention takes the form of a transmission control system for a transmission having an output shaft, which includes a friction element which is engageable to produce a forward speed ratio, a first device for selectively supplying hydraulic fluid under pressure to the friction element through a first flow restriction, a second device whiCh produces a signal which varies with an operational parameter of the transmission, and which features an orifice valve interposed between the first device and the friction element for decreasing the flow restriction between the first device and the friction element in response to the magnitude of the signal increasing above a predetermined level.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The features and advantages of the arrangement of the present invention will become more clearly appreciated from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a section view of a first embodiment of the present invention Figs. 2 and 3 are graphs showing the friction element engagement characteristics derived with the first embodiment during high speed and low speed downshifts, respectively and Fig. 4 shows a second embodiment of the present invention.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Fig. 1 shows schematically a first embodiment of the present invention. For the sake of explantion let it be assumed that the transmission into which this embodiment of the invention is incorporated is a four forward speed planetary gear transmssion and that the friction element 10 is in fact a clutch which is engaged during a h 3 downshift. For a more detailed description of one example of transmission control system to which the present invention may be applied reference may be had to appljcafltts copending U.S. ardent Application Serial No. 518,413 filed on July 29, 1983 in the name of Sugano, or applicant corresponding copending European Patent ApplicationNo. 83107503.1 filed on July 29, 1983. It should be noted that the valve which characterizes the present invention may be used in conjunction with clutch C3 and accumulator 140 disclosed in the above mentioned documents but is not specifically limited to same and may find application in conjunction with any other friction element accumulator arrangement wherein a variable orifice effect is desirable. The content of the above mentioned applications is hereby incorporated by reference thereto In the arrangement illustrated in Fig. 1, friction element 10 is arranged to be supplied line pressure from a 3 4 shift valve 12 via conduit 14. In order to attenuate shift shock, a first flow restriction or orifice 16 is disposed in conduit 14 and an accumulator 18 arranged to communicate with conduit 14 a location downstream of the orifice 16. This accumulator 18 includes a stepped piston 20 which is reciprocatively disposed in a stepped bore 22. A spring 24 is arranged to bias the piston 20 in a direction which minimizes the volume of a chamber 26 which is in fluid communication with friction element 10. Line pressure is supplied to a chamber 28 of the accumulator via conduit 29.With this arrangemenF , as diameter of the piston 20 exposed to chamber 26 is greater than that exposed to chamber 28 u pon line pressure being fed to the friction element 10 via conduit 14 to induce a shift from one gear ratio the next lower one, the force produced by the fluid in chamber 26 overcomes that produced by the combination of the fluid and spring 24 in chamber 28 and the piston 20 moves upwardly as seen in the drawings to increase the volume of chamber 26 and attenuate the rate at which pressure builds in the friction element 10. An orifice valve 30 which characterizes the present invention, in this embodiment takes the form of a spool valve including a bore 32 in which ports 33, 34, 35 36 are formed and a spool valve element 39 having first and second lands 37, 38 thereon. As shown, the spool is received in bore so as to define variable volume chambers at each end thereof The upper chamber 40 communicates with port 33 which in this instance acts as a drain. The lower chamber 42 is communicated via port 36 with the governor valve 44 of the transmission via conduit 46. A spring 48 is disposed in the upper chamber 40 and arranged to bias the spool valve element 34 in a direction to minimize the volume of chamber 42. Port 35 of the orifice valve is arranged to communicate with conduit 14 at a location upstream of the orifice 16 while port 34 is arranged to communicate with both of the accumulator 18 and conduit 16 at a location downstream of orifice via a conduit 50. A second orifice 52 is disposed in conduit 50. When the rotational speed of the output shaft 54 of the transmission viz., the vehicle speed is relatively low, the governor pressure fed to chamber 42 is insufficient to move the spool valve element 34 against the bias of spring 48, the latter being arranged to hold the spool valve element 34 in the position shown in right hand half section until a predetermined governor pressure prevails in chamber 42. Viz., a pressure which is generated only upon the vehicle speed having reached or exceeded a predetermined value. Under these conditions viz., low governor pressure land 38 of spool valve element 34 is located so as to close port 35 and therefore permit pressurized hydraulic fluid from the shift valve 12 to be fed to the accumulator 18 and the friction element 10 via only flow restriction 16.The orifice effect provided by the single flow restriction or orifice 16 is selected to produce a friction element engagement rate which is suited to low speed shifting. Upon the governor pressure exceeding the previously mentioned predetermined level, the spool valve element 34 moves upwardly against the bias of spring 48 to open port 35 and therefore establish communication between port 35 and port 34. This of course means that the pressurized hydraulic fluid from the shift valve t2 can now pass through both flow restrictors, viz., orifices 16, 52. Under these conditions the rate at which the pressure builds in the accumulator 18 and friction element 10 is increased as compared with the former case wherein only a single orifice was available. Accordingly, the engagement time of the friction element is reduced. By appropriately selecting orifice 16 so as to provide the desired rate of friction element engagement at low vehicle speeds, it is very easy to select the size of orifice 52 so as to obtain the desired engagement rate at high vehicle speeds. Figs. 2 and 3 show the engagement characteristics which may be derived at high and low vehicle speeds, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2,when both oriiices 16, 52 are used, at time t1 seconds after the initiation of the shift, the hydraulic pressure in the friction element 10 maximizes. At a time t11 seconds the engin e RPM ceases to increase and becomes constant. In comparison when only one orifice viz., orifice 16 is available see Fig. 3 , the time at which the pressure in the friction element 10 maximizes is increased to t2 seconds while the engine speed levels off after a period of t2 seconds. As a result of the reduced engagement time at high speeds, the engine is prevented from momentarily racing and permitting the engine speed from rising excessively to levels above that suited for the particular downshift. Fig. 4 shows a second embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment differs from the first in that the second orifice 52 is replaced by a third land 60 on the spool valve element 34. As shown, this land 60 is is arranged to have a diameter slightly less than the section of the bore in which it reciprocates and thus cause a flow restriction beteen ports 34 and 35 when the spool valve element 34 assumes the position illustrated by the left hand half section. As the function and operation of this embodiment is essentially identical to that of the first further description of same will be omitted for brevity.
