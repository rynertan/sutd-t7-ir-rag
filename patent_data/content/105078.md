# Fiber optic scanning system for laser thermal inspection.

## Abstract
An apparatus for inspecting a device 10 made up of a plurality of different infrared radiating elements 12 in cludes an optical head 14 which is moveable along X Y coordinates above the fixed device 10 to sequentially scan the infrared radiating elements 12 . A laser beam source 16 is operatively connected to the moveable head 14 for injecting thermal energy into the infrared radiating ele ments 12 and an infrared detector 22 is provided for sensing the infrared radiation emanating from the elements 12 . The infrared detector 22 may be mounted directly on the moveable head 14 or in a remote location wherein the detector 22 would be connected to the moveable head 14 by a flexible optical fiber 24 . A second moveable head may be located on the opposite side of the device so that thermal energy from the laser source may be injected into opposite sides of the infrared radiating element.
