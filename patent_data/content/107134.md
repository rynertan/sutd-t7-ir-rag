# Tricyclic antidepressant drug immunogens, antibodies, labeled conjugates, and related derivatives.

## Abstract
Tricyclic antidepressant drug e.g., imipramine, desi pramine, amitriptyline, or nortriptyline immunogens, anti bodies prepared therefrom, labeled conjugates, synthetic intermediates, and the use of such antibodies and labeled conjugates in immunoassays for determining such drug. The immunogens comprise the drug coupled at its 2 position to an immunogenic carrier material. Similarly, the labeled conjugates and synthetic intermediates are 2 derivatives of the drug or a precusor thereof. The antibodies and labeled reagents are particularly useful in certain ho mogeneous nonradioisotopic immunoassays for measuring tricyclic antidepressant drugs in biological fluids such as serum.
