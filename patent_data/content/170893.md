# Microbiocidal anionic sequesterants with polyvalent metal cations for permeability correction process.

## Abstract
A water permeability correction process, and composi tion therefor, to improve the sweep efficiency of waterflooding which involves the sequential injection of 1 an optional aque ous preflush slug to adjust connate water salinity, 2 an aque ous sequestered polyvalent metal cation, such as chromium, wherein the sequestering anion is bactericidal, such as propio nate, 3 a gelable polymeric viscosifier, such as polyacryl amide, and, preferably, 4 an aqueous drive fluid.
