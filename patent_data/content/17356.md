# Lens element.

## Abstract
A lens element for a vehicle lamp e.g. a direction indicator lamp consists of a moulded transparent plastics body 10 provided with parallel rows of projections 11 each of which has the form of part of a body of revolution or a cylindrical mid region and end regions which each have the form of part of the body of revolution of the mid region. In order to produce the required light output in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the vehicle in the case where the lens element is used in a lamp assembly having a relatively inefficient reflector, the lens element is provided with a plurality of ribs 12 which extend parallel to the rows of projections and which are longer than the projections 11 . The ribs 12 preferably alternate with the rows of projections 11 and may extend for the whole or only part of the length of the lens element.
