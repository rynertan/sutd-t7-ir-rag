# Improvements in and relating to a method of detecting a certain gas in an animal.

## Abstract
A method to detect indirectly at least one gas, particular ly dissolved gases, of an animal employing nuclear magnetic resonance techniques NMR . The method examines an NMR spectrum to determine chemical shift relaxation times or spin spin couplings for an element of an animal influenced by at least one gas of the animal, the chemical shift corresponding to the amount or identify of the gas.
