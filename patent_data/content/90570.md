# VENTING SYSTEM FOR ELECTRIC STORAGE BATTERY

## Abstract
Venting system for an electric storage battery 2 having an electrolyte drainage aperture 24 at the low point in the sloping floor 22 of an electrolyte trapping chamber 18 and including an integrally moulded shielding enclosure 48 depending beneath the aperture 24. The enclosure 48 is defined in part by a flap like closure wall 61 which is resiliently rooted to the underside of the floor 22 and depends therefrom at such an angle as to underlie the aperture 24. The resiliently rooted wall 61 permits the wall 61 to be moulded beneath the aperture 24 yet deflect out of the way and return to its original position i.e., due to the plastic memory of the synthetic plastics material used to mould the trapping chamber 18 and the shielding enclosure 48 when the mould core is withdrawn.
