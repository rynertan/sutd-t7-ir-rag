# Endoprosthetic joint devices.

## Abstract
An endoprosthetic knee joint device as femoral 10 and tibial 20 components respectively adapted for connection to the femur and tibia, and respective bearing surfaces for mutual articulatory engagement to simulate natural joint movements. It is now proposed that the femoral component has two transversely spaced spockets 15 as bearing surfaces, and that the tibial component has two upstanding ball parts 28 for respective articulation in the sockets. The ball parts can be separable, by the provision of stems 31 engageable in apertures 30 in the base part. Preferably, the sockets are enlarged relative to the balls to allow mutual rotation about the axis of the leg. Also, the sockets and balls can be of different material from their respective base parts, the latter suitably being of metal.
