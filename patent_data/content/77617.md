# Lubricant retainer and gear case fitted therewith.

## Abstract
A lubricant retaining device 55,56 for a gear case 10 , typically around locomotive traction gearing, is an annulus of resilient material or series of resilient leaves. It has a web 63,94 which overhangs a rotary member 32 proximate an opening in the case 10 , and so keeps lubricant off the surface of the rotary member 32 along which it has hitherto tended to escape past contact seals. The webs 63,94 are deformed towards a side wall 20,21 of the case 10 to permit passage of the toothed part 71 of a gear 13 when the gear case 10 is assembled. The web 63 then returns to extend under the toothed part 71 to prevent lubricant falling from the toothed part 71 onto the rotary member 32 . During assembly of the case 10 the web 63,94 may be held against the side wall of the casing by spacer bars 82 which are removed after insertion of the gear 13 .
