# Photographic material suited for the production of multicolour images by means of diffusion transfer of complexed silver halide.

## Abstract
A photographic material for the production of multicolour images by means of diffusion transfer of complexed silver halide is provided. Said material contains a support having thereon at least three differently spectrally sensitive silver halide emulsion layers that are each sensitive to light of a different additive primary colour, associated with each silver halide emulsion layer a silver precipitating layer containing development nuclei and a different dye releasing compound for producing a subtractive multicolour image, and optionally one or more non light sensitive, non dye releasing water permeable hydrophilic colloid interlayers. In said material for better colour separation the layers are arranged in a special order.
