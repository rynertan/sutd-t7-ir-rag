# CONTROL APPARATUS FOR ELECTRIC MOTORS.

## Abstract
Method of controlling an electric motor and a control unit therefor for digitally controlling through a digital operational circuit 305 an electric motor 304 driven by a pulse width modulating inverter 303 . A plurality of register files 640, 641 make up a register file means for time sharing controlling by use of stage signals groups of refer ence register 601 602 , groups of temporary registers 604 605 , comparator circuits 611 A 611 B and groups of comparator output latches 615, 616 620, 621 , so that an electric motor is controlled at the fundamental frequency of a pulse width modulated signal with higher resolution be cause of increasing the processing rate by use of the stage signals.
