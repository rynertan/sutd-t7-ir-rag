# Controlling lasers.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for controlling an external cavity of a semiconductor laser to maintain its emission in a single longitudinal mode. The length of the external cavity is varied by an electromagnet acting on ferrogmagnetic mate rial 6 attached to a copper foil reflector 4. Total optical power output of the laser is monitored and single longitudinal mode operation is achieved by maximising the power output. An active technique employs modulation of the reflector position about a mean value. The magnetic manipu lation of the reflector may find application in other laser systems, e.g. gas lasers.
