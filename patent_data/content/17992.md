EXAMPLE 42Preparation of 3 ethil 4 2 2 p nitrobenzyloxycarbonylamino ethylthio vinyl 2 azetidinoneEMI186.1 Following the procedures in Example 13 Steps D F except that an equivalent amount of 3 ethyl l t butyldimethylsilyl 4 vinyl 2 azetidinone is used in place ofCompound 26 of Example 13 Step D, the title compound is obtained. EXAMPLE 43Following the foregoing Examples and text, the following additionally prefered antibiotic compounds of the present invention are prepared in further representative demonstration of the disclosed process Table II. The collum labelled Remarks and Reagents annotates the established procedure where necessary to obtain the indicated compound. In most instances the compounds are deblocked according to the previously described procedure. However, when the SR8 side chain does not contain a basic function, the final product I is more conveniently isolated as the sodium salt M Na which result isfacilitated by conducting the deblocking in a slight excess of NaHCO3.In any event, when either R6 or R7 bears a basic group, the final product I is most conveniently isolated as the free acid M H , rather than the sodium salt. It should be noted as aconsequence of the ir zwitterionic nature. EMI187.1 M H, Na Also entered in Table II, under the EMI188.1 collum, are certain preferred amidine and guanidine derivatives of I. Such derivatives are formed from compounds of Table II which carry an R8 side chain bearing an amino group NH2 .As mentioned earlier such side chains may be symbolized by R8 NH2 and thus such amidine and guanidine derivatives may be depicted generically by the structure EMI188.2 Table II EMI189.1 Com SEP X tb pound SEP R6 SEP R7 SEP R8 SEP R8 C SEP Remarks, SEP Reagents tb SEP Y tb 1, SEP CH3 2CH SEP H SEP SEP As SEP in SEP Example SEP 12, SEP but tb SEP substitute SEP HS SEP for tb SEP HSCH2CH2NHCO2PNB.Deblock tb SEP as SEP described SEP in SEP Example SEP 12 tb SEP and SEP isolate SEP product SEP as tb SEP Na SEP salt.
