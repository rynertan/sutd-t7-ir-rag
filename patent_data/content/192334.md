## Description
This invention relates to the extraction of tin values as organotin compounds directly from tin bearing ores and slags. Tin is found naturally in several minerals but only cassiterite SnO₂ is of commercial importance. As the reduction of tin oxides is comparatively easy, tin is primarily extracted from the ore by pyrometallurgical reduction processes which involve smelting the ore, after concentrating the tin moiety physically utilising the high density of cassiterite. Cassiterite ore occurs both as alluvial and lode deposits. The ore deposits, particularly the lode ores, are usually found associated with other materials which generally hinder tin refining to some extent. The presence of sulphur and iron is deleterious during smelting while other elements such as As, Sb, Bi, Pb, Cu, and Ag necessitate further process steps during refining. The reaction conditions necessary for the reduction of tin dioxide are also appropriate for the reduction of oxides of other metals which may be present. Iron is particularly troublesome owing to its mutual solubility with tin. In the usual temperature range at which tin refining is carried out, the solid in equilibrium with liquid tin is FeSn₂, the so called hardhead , containing l9 iron by weight. Present methods of removing iron from tin depend on the crystallisation of FeSn₂ from liquid tin at low temperatures. Various processes have also been proposed for removing tin from slags and low grade material which depend on the formation of volatile inorganic tin compounds notably the stannous oxide, sulphide or chloride, to separate tin from the other elements, leading to the continuing use of the so called fuming technique. A general review of such methods is made in Extractive Metallurgy of Tin P.A. Wright, Chapter 9 1982 . Also see Kirk Othmer, Vol. 23, 3rd Ed, pp 21 24. In these methods tin removal is not usually affected by the presence of iron. Other methods for tin extraction include reduction hydrometallurgy which has been the subject of much investigation, previous work having been reviewed by Wright, Various proposals have been made to extract tin from its ores by reduction of cassiterite to tin metal and then extracting the tin with aqueous inorganic acids. Mantell, in Tin second edition 1949 Chapter 7, describes a process wherein low temperature ca. 750 C reduction is followed by counter current leaching and electrolytic deposition of tin giving a tin depleted leach liquor for reuse. Mantell suggested that the combination of hydrogen reduction, leaching and electrolyte deposition of tin offered an economical method, with greater ease of operation than conventional smelting, and was capable of producing the highest grade of metal from the complex ores. GB A 1278207 describes a similar process wherein finely divided tin ore is roasted, contacted with a gaseous reductant in a controlled moisture atmosphere and thereafter leached with dilute hydrochloric acid to remove tin metal and iron or iron compounds. The liquor extract is then contacted with a metal higher than tin in the electrochemical series to extract metallic tin by cementation. However, it is clear that according to the methods described by Mantell and in GB A 1278207 that other metals than tin present in the ore are also extracted by the acid leaching and these metals build up in the leach liquor. It is therefore desirable to remove these other metals from the system. Consequently, GB A 1278207 describes the use of a spray roaster to recover hydrochloric acid and to remove the other metals from the system. A further disadvantage of the acid leach process is that after the roast reduction stages, anions, such as fluoride which is commonly associated with cassiterite deposits, will also be rendered soluble and extracted into the hydrochloric acid phase. As it is normally a necessary step in such processes to recover the hydrochloric acid for further use, the presence of other acids, particularly hydrofluoric acid, would be clearly undesirable as it would lead to the corrosive destruction of the spray roaster apparatus itself . A somewhat different reduction process is described in GB A 2060708. This patent describes a process in which aqueous or solvent carried reducing agents are used to reduce the insoluble higher valency inorganic tin compounds in tin bearing ores to form soluble lower valency stannous salts. The preferred reducing agents are divalent vanadium and divalent chromium ions. The solubilised tin is then electrolytically precipitated from the leach liquor and the reducing agent is regenerated by further electrolysis. Gaseous reduction of tin ores has been studied periodically over many years. The use of hydrogen or carbon monoxide gases has been most frequently proposed but other reducing gases such as commercial gases containing hydrogen and carbon monoxide mixtures and hydrocarbons have been used. Gas mixtures comprising H₂ H₂O or CO CO₂ have the particular advantage that minerals containing iron are reduced to Fe₃O₄ rather than elemental iron or FeO which are both leachable into acid solutions. Further, using such gas mixtures, tin iron alloys such as hardhead are prevented from forming. Thus, the prior art dealing with the recovery of tin from its ores has relied on inorganic compound formation and or heat or electrolytic means. By contrast, the present invention has as its primary object an improved ore refining process which overcomes the foregoing disadvantages and which surprisingly provides for the direct production of valuable organotin compounds which may be used as such or which easily permit the recovery of substantially pure elemental tin from the ore without using electrolytic, fuming or like further heat treatments which have been commonly employed to date. According to the invention there is provided a process for the direct extraction of tin values from unrefined tin ores and ore slags having a tin content of at most 70 wt , which process comprises reducing a comminuted but unrefined tin ore or slag, treating said reduced tin ore or slag with a hydrocarbyl halide to form an organo hydrocarbyl tin compound, and separating said organo hydrocarbyl tin compound from the tin depleted solid ore or slag residue. Even though the ore concentrate used in this invention as obtained from first an optional roasting or calcining followed by a reduction process dominantly contains various non tin constituents and has only a relatively low tin content, we have now found it possible to react an unrefined ore or slag directly with an organic halide, in the presence or absence of a catalyst, as a result of which a relatively pure organic tin component may be directly extracted or obtained from the unrefined ore or slag. The organic tin compound may be used as such or can easily be decomposed to provide highly pure elemental tin. In its broadest aspect, therefore, the process of the present invention comprises optionally calcining ground concentrated tin ore to remove sulphides and any other volatile constituents of the ore, reducing the tin oxide content thereof, wholly or partially, to tin in a reducing atmosphere, preferably hydrogen, and contacting the resulting particulate solide composition with a hydrocarbyl halide to form directly an organotin product which may then be readily extracted and purified. It is a particular advantage of the process of this invention that few other elements will react with the hydrocarbyl halide reactant under the conditions of the process and accordingly it has now been discovered that tin values can be directly extracted from the thus treated ore in the form of relatively pure organotin compounds, despite the presence of the other metal constituents in the ore. For instance, typical ore concentrates such as are obtained from the cassiterite deposits in Cornwall, United Kingdom, may contain, in addition to tin, zinc, aluminium, sulphur, iron and minor amounts of elements such as arsenic and bismuth derived from accompanying minerals. Much of the arsenic would be removed during an initial calcining stage but any residual arsenic along with bismuth, may react with certain organic halides and could be collected in an organic phase along with the tin. Other tin ore concentrates may also contain lead and or antimony, which have not been removed during the calcining stage, but which may react with the organic halide and be extracted into the organic phase along with the tin. We have found, however, that these elements can easily be separated from the organotin compound product by known methods. For example, organolead compounds can be cracked during distillation of the organotin compound product and thereby can be removed from the tin. The organotin compounds separated from the ores by this invention are valuable intermediate products for the production of other organotin compounds which have found many applications commercially such as synthetic polymer stabilisers, herbicides and fungicides. It is a feature of the invention that particularly desired organotin compounds can be directly manufactured by selection of particular organic halides and conditions under which the tin values are extracted from the ores. For example, the tin values may be extracted as dimethyltin dichloride when using methyl chloride as a reactant in the presence of a catalyst such as a trialkyl phosphine and or a metal such as copper. Even though the reaction of tin metal with certain organic compounds has long been known, and despite numerous prior efforts which have been devoted to improving the economics of the recovery of tin from low to medium, and even high grade ores, the present process which provides a direct extraction of tin values from the unrefined ore has not been previously described or contemplated. That is, to the extent that the synthesis of the organotin compounds, as is involved in the present invention had been described for many years in the literature, prior workers have only used as the starting metal an already refined tin metal. By contrast, the present invention bypasses the conventional refining stage and extracts tin values directly from the reduced, but unrefined ores to form the organotin compounds, even as a final commercial product, and provides a highly efficient extraction and recovery of tin values from the unrefined ores. For instance, in the prior art it has long been known that pure elemental tin can be made to react with organic halides, usually in the presence of a catalyst, to form organotin halides or tetraorganotins. For example see the review articles by Murphy Poller, The Preparation of Organotin Compounds by the Direct Reaction , J. Organomet. Chem. The direct reaction of tin with an organic halide in the presence of catalytic amounts of a quaternary ammonium and phosphonium compound or of a ternary sulphonium or iso sulphonium compound to produce primarily mono and diorganotin halides possibly with triorganotin halides as a minor product is disclosed in several earlier patent specifications for example, British specifications Nos. 1,115,646, 1,053,996 and 1,222,642, respectively also US A 3,415,857, US A 3,745,183 and US A 3,519,665. GB A 1,115,646 discloses reacting metallic tin which may be used in powder, sheet or granule form, and may be part of an alloy, especially with a co catalyst with an aliphatic halide in the presence of a catalyst, which is an onium compound defined as a compound containing organic groups covalently bonded to a positively charged non metallic atom from Group V or VI of the Periodic Table, and exemplified by tetraalkylammonium halides, tetraalkylphosphonium halides and trialkylsulphonium halides and in the presence of a pre formed stannous halide or pre formed organotin halide, and optionally in the presence of a small amount of a co catalyst which is one of thirteen defined metals said small amount being up to 0.1 mole per gram atom of tin . The product of the reaction of GB A 1,115,646 is a mixture of organotin halides in which the diorganotin dihalide predominates. In EP A 83981 we describe a process for the production of organotin halides by the direct reaction of elemental tin metal with an organic halide in the presence of a reagent amount of a compound of the formula Cat US A 3,651,108 has also described the preparation of tetraorganotin compounds by reaction of organic halides in the presence of an onium compound, or Lewis base, with tin metal and an alkali or alkaline earth metal, in particular magnesium. Similarly US A 4,179,458 and US A 4,092,340 describe processes for preparing tetraorganotin compounds which comprise reacting an organic halide of formula RX with a heated suspension of metallic material which is zinc and tin in the atomic proportions of at least 0.5 to 1 in a liquid comprising at least one onium salt, which salt is an organic quaternary ammonium or phosphonium or tertiary sulphonium salt, to produce the tetraorganotin compound. In US_A 4,179,458 this agent is a liquid, in US A 4,092,340, it is a gas. From the examples given in these two cases, the processes appear to be Metals have also been proposed as catalysts in the direct synthesis of organotin halides from the refined metal. Smith and Rochow in J. Amer. Chem. Soc. Kizlink, in his review article, Overall, however, and as can be seen from the prior art, the direct synthesis of organotin halides or tetraorganotins as reported in the literature has required and has only been described as using expensive, already refined,substantially pure tin metal, mainly in powder form, or its alloys. That is, in all of the cases described above the tin used has already been extracted from the ore by conventional processes and was further refined before use in the organotin process. Accordingly, in one aspect of the present invention, an organotin product containing predominately diorganotin dihalide is produced directly by reacting a comminuted, optionally calcined, reduced but unrefined ore concentrate or slag with an organic halide and catalyst. Conditions for this reaction may be as described in GB A 1115646. According to another aspect of the invention, a product containing predominantly triorganotin halide can be produced by extracting the tin values from an optionally calcined, reduced but unrefined ore concentrate or slag. Conditions for this reaction may be as described in US A 4510095. In a further aspect of the invention, zinc may be added to the unrefined ore concentrate or slag and a product containing predominately tetraorganotin can be produced by extracting the tin values from an optionally calcined, reduced but unrefined ore or slag concentrate. Conditions for this reaction may be as described in GB A 1548365. According to the present invention, tin values are directly extracted from unrefined ores or slags as a compound of the formula R The products separated from the now tin depleted ore or slag residues are usually a mixture of organotin halides except when zinc is added to the ore concentrate when the product is a tetraorganotin and residual reagents and or catalysts. The tin compounds thus formed are generally liquid at normal temperatures which facilitates their separation from the ore or slag residue. These products can be treated in several ways already known to those skilled in the art to purify them or to recover highly purified tin metal therefrom. Generally it is preferred that the organotin halides are purified by either solvent extraction or by distillation, with the reagents and or catalysts so used then recovered for further re cycled use. The distilled organotin halides can themselves be further purified, for example, by fractional distillation, to separate the diorganotins which can be used directly to produce stabilisers or the triorganotins which are useful starting materials for the productions of other triorganotin compounds which are themselves biocides . It is also useful to use diorganotin and triorganotin halide mixtures now obtained directly from the unrefined ore concentrate as the starting material for the process described in EP A 83981. Alternatively, the organotin halide mixtures may be thermally decomposed to give pure elemental tin. Tin ores used in the process of the invention may be low grade primary extracts containing as little as 5 tin such as from cassiterite up to high grade extracts containing about 70 SnO₂. The invention can also be applied to low grade slags, obtained in one processing, which typically contain only 2 to 3 tin. There are substantial quantities of such slags left as by products from conventional refining techniques from which the residual hitherto wasted tin values can now be recovered. The organic halides used in this invention are of the formula RX where both R and X are as defined above. Depending on the organotin product desired, the organic halide may be used in amounts of from less than 1 mole per gram atom tin present in the concentrate during the reaction to a considerable excess of up to about 5 times the theoretical quantity for organotin formation. The preferred organic catalyst for the tin extraction is an onium compound as defined in GB A 1115646 US A 3,415,857 and is normally present in an amount of from 0.1 to 0.6, preferably 0.2 to 0.5 moles per gram atom of tin in the tin ore or slag. Alternatively, the onium compounds may be present in reagent amounts as described in EP A 83581 where at least one mole of reagent is used per 5 moles of RX, preferably at least one mole of reagent per 4 moles of RX. According to one embodiment of the process of the present invention, finely ground tin ore, wherein the tin in the tin bearing materials has been reduced to elemental tin by gaseous reduction, is heated together with an organic halide and an onium compound at a temperature preferably between 100 200 C under reflux conditions until substantially all the tin content in the ore concentrate has dissolved. The resulting mixture of soluble organotin compounds is then separated and washed from the ore residue by solvent extraction using an organic solvent. A suitable solvent may be the organic halide reagent. The combined liquid phases are then distilled to remove the solvent for reuse and a residue of organotin compounds remains. This residue may be further purified, e.g. by distillation thermally decomposed or used as a starting material for the production of other organotin compounds. In an alternative process according to the invention, ground, calcined tin ore concentrates, which have been reduced by gaseous reduction, are mixed with a metallic catalyst and heated at a temperature of 300 400 C while passing an organic nalide in the gaseous state over the same. The resulting vapors containing the organotin product are then condensed and purified by any of the methods already known to those skilled in the art for those products. The initial calcining of the ore concentrate may be omitted whenever the ore impurities are in low concentration and or do not present a problem in obtaining the desired organotin compounds. Whatever embodiment of the process of this invention is effected, it has been found that the presence of other elements naturally present in the ore concentrates such as copper or zinc turns out to be in fact useful in that it is now found that such metals are in a form in the ore concentrate such that they can act as A preferred gaseous reduction mixture for use on the optionally calcined ore or slag is H₂ H₂O which ensures that any combined iron values present in the ore or slag are not reduced to iron metal which could alloy with the tin or react with the organic halide when it is passed over the ore or slag. In addition, and if desired and appropriate with a given ore or slag composition, following reduction a re oxidation stage may be employed to convert the iron to iron oxide. This has the advantage that the iron oxide does not react with the organic halide. The invention is further illustrated by reference to the following Examples in which parts and percentages are by weight. This indicates that approximately 34 of the tin in the ore had been extracted. Analysis of the reduced concentrates indicated complete reduction of the tin compounds present in amounts of from about 13 to 53 wt . Samples of the roast reduced materials were mixed with copper powder catalyst, heated to 315 C in an electric furnace whilst passing over gaseous methyl chloride, and held at this temperature for the periods of time indicated in Table 2. Analysis of the residue indicated an extraction of 80 95 of the tin. The gaseous products were scrubbed using dichloromethane and analysed for chlorine content, which with melting point indicated a recovery of dimethyltin dichloride. Samples of the roast reduced materials of varying tin concentration were then refluxed at 100 105 C with butyl bromide and tetrabutylammonium bromide as catalyst as shown in Table 3. Product separation was effected by filtration, washing with butyl bromide and finally washing with acetone. The solvent was removed by distillation and the residual product distilled under vacuum and collected in cold traps. On analysis, the product was shown to be a mixture of mono , di and tributyltin bromides, and the level of tin extraction was from 34 to over 60 . Samples of the roast reduced materials optionally mixed with copper catalyst Examples 8,9 were heated with stirring in a 2500ml round bottomed glass reactor into which methyl chloride was blown. The gaseous products were scrubbed using dichloromethane and analysed. A summary of the experimental conditions and analysis of the products which comprised mixtures of mono , di and trimethyltin chlorides, is given in Table 4. In Example 7, a recovery of 44 was achieved even without a catalyst. In Example 8 the recovery was 60 , which increased to 75 when extraction time was extended to 26.5 hours. Samples of roast reduced materials of varying tin content were next mixed with copper powder catalyst and heated with stirring in a 2500ml round bottomed glass reactor into which methyl chloride was blown. The gaseous products were scrubbed and analysed for tin content. The experimental conditions and analysis of the products which comprised mixtures of mono , di and trimethyl tin chlorides are given in Table 6. The results of Examples 10 l4 suggest that the amount of water used in the reduction stage should be optimized for maximum organotin extraction.
