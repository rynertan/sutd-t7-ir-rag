# DEFROSTING CONTROL APPARATUS

## Abstract
The accumulation of ice on a surface such as an evaporator fin 2 in a refrigerator unit is detected by a mechanical probe 4 which is moved by a bimetal bender element 8 upon periodic timer controlled energisation of a bimetal heater 12 so as to pass over the surfaces of an evaporator fin 2 . If the movement of the probe is obstructed by ice on the evaporator fin surfaces a switch 24 is operated by a bistable mechanism 16,18,19 , causing energisation of a defrosting heater 25 and switching off the refrigerator compressor motor C . If no ice is detected the probe 4 returns to its original reset position without operating the defrost control switch 24 .
