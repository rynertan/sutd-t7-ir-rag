# DIGITIZER TABLET

## Abstract
A digitizer tablet 50 providing accurate two dimensional coordinate location of the position of a cursor 54 over the entire surface of the tablet 50. The position values are derived from sequential pulse signals emanating from a grid matrix within the plane of the tablet and received by a magnetic pickup 60 within the cursor body. The grid matrix 60 is energized with signal pulses and arranged in a predistorted manner to extend the useful area of the tablet 50 to include the edge of the grid matrix. Furthermore, the tabler matrix and the associated drive and calculating electronics are incorporated on a unitary circuit board wherein the electronics are within the tablet area useable for cursor location determination.
