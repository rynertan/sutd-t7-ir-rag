# Impregnated cellular articles.

## Abstract
Uniform impregnation of a cellular e.g. foam article with a flame retardant substance is obtained by providing the article, prior to impregnation, with a plurality of holes or cavities extending through or part way through the shortest dimension of the article and being uniformly distributed over a principal surface area thereof. This method is of particular value where the articles to be impregnated have a thickness greater than about 4cm.

## Description
IMPREGNATED CFTXULAR ARTICLES This invention relates to impregnated cellular articles and in particular to an improved method for impregnating cellular articles with a flame retardant medium. Cellular materials, especially foams, are widely used as upholstery and bedding components. Since such materials are often inherently flammable and decompose in a fire situation with the emission of toxic products of combustion, it is well known to those skilled in the art that some treatment of these materials is necessary to render them flame retardant. Moreover, many countries have introduced legislation to provide a minimum standard of flame retardanoy in such materials. Our UK Patents 1.519.795 and 1.589.858 disclose foamed upholstery components which have been rendered flame retardant by impregnating the foam materials with, for example, a hydrated aluminium compound in a latexbased carrier. Wle have found that although satisfactory uniform impregnation of the foam material can be achieved hen the thickness of the material to be impregnated does not exceed around 4 cm, the impregnation of thicker foam articles requires a considerable input of labour and skill if the impregnation is to be uniform and if drying of the impregnated foam is to be effective. For example, impregnation of a 10 cm thick foam article with a latex dispersion of gibbsite results in non uniform impregnation even after repeated compression and relaxation of the foam whilst the foam is totally submerged in the dispersion.Drying requires upwards of 8 hours at elevated temperature. The more exacting standards for flame retardancy now being set by the UK Crown Suppliers e.g. F.T.S.No.15 , require full depth flame retardant foam. Because of the difficulty of uniformly impregnating and effectively drying a cellular article of thickness greater than about 4 cm, it has been the practice to achieve the required thickness of flame retardant foam by laminating together several thiifl er layers of foam, each layer having previ nisly been impregnated and dried. This procedure, too, is costly and labour intensive and the increased costs of manufacture are inevitably reflected in the selling price of the products. It has now been found that uniform impregnation and effective drying of a cellular article having a thickness greater than 4 cm can be achieved according to the present invention by providing the cellular article prior to impregnation1 with a plurality of holes or cavities. For example, a commonly employed thickness for a foam mattress is 10 cm and we have found that impregnation of a 10 cm thick foam article can readily be achieved by means of the method of the present invention. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of impregnating an article of a cellular material, in lich, prior to Impregnation, the said article is provided with a plurality of holes or cavities. The present invention also provides an impregnated cellular article made according to the method disclosed in the immediately preceding paragraph. Preferably, the holes or cavities extend along the shortest dimension of the cellular article and are distributed over a principal surface area of the article. In one embodiment of the present invention, the holes or cavities may extend through the shortest dimension of the cellular article from one principal surface to the other. In a second embodiment, the holes or cavities may extend part way through the shortest dimension of ghe cellular article, opening at one of the principal surfaces. Alternatively, two sets of holes or caviti es may be provided, each set extending from one of the principal surfaces and part way through the shortest dimension of the article. Preferably, the said two sets of holes or cavities are off set relative to each other. The cellular material suitably comprises . a flexible foam, especially a flexible polyurethane foam. The holes or cavities can be obtained by fabrication of an already produced cellular article. Alternatively, the cellular article can be moulded so as to include the holes or cavities. A suitable distribution of holes or cavities in a block of cellular material having dimensions 90 x 190 x 10 cm is the provision of holes or cavities having a diameter of from 4 to 25 mm preferably around 10 mm . The holes or cavities are so disposed relative to one another that the distance between any portion of the cellular material and the periphery of a hole or cavity does not exceed 40 mm, preferably about 20 mm. We have found that the drying time of such a block when compared to a similar block without holes or cavities can be reduced, according to the present invention, by one third to one half. Noreover, the uniformity of impregnation is considerably improved, thus eliminating the need to fabricate blocks of 10 cm thickness and upwards by a costly lamination method. The present invention will be illustrated, merely by way of example, as followsEXAMPLE A block of a flexible polyetherurethane foam having a density of 20 Kg m3 and dimensions 90 x 190 x 10 cm was provided by fabrication with a plurality of throughholes, the holes being uniformly distributed over the entire surface of the block. Each hole was of average diameter 10 mm and arranged in rectangular pitch, extending through the shortest dimension of the block.The distance between adjacent centres was 30 mm, whereby no part of the foam was more than about 16 mm from the periphery of a hole. The drilled block was impregnated with a flame retardant medium comprising a hydrated aluminium compound in a suitable latex binder. The impregnated block was then passed throw the nip of a pair of rollers to remove excess impregnant before being dried for 2 hours 20 minutes at 100 C. A second foam block, identical with the first except for the through holes, was impregnated with the same name retardant medium. The drying stage took 8 hours at 1000C. It is to be understood that the method of the present invention is applicable to all types of flexible impregnated cellular material.
