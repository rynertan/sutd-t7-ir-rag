# Light source comprising a high pressure discharge lamp.

## Abstract
A high pressure sodium lamp 10 , which includes a discharge tube 20 enclosing xenon at pressures in excess of 300 torr, is reliably started by the combina tion of an igniter 16 , a conductor 12 wrapped around the discharge tube 20 , and a switching circuit 14 . The igniter 16 provides periodic pulses of 2500 to 4000 volts with a duration of at least one microsecond. The switching circuit 14 provides a high voltage pulse hav ing an amplitude about equal to the amplitude of the periodic pulses and a duration much greater than the duration of the periodic pulses. The conductor 12 in tensifies the electric field within the discharge tube 20 . A conventional lamp ballast 18 provides ac power dur ing starting and normal operation.
