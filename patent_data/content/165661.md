# Universal drive joint.

## Abstract
A tripot type universal drive joint has a spider assembly 28 retained therein by an annular resilient spring wire retainer 52 having small diameter segments 54 releasably mounted in an internal retention groove 56 in a drive housing 12 of the joint, and also having offset large diameter access segments 60 disposed externally of the housing and adjacent an open end thereof. The wire retainer also has blocking steps 58 which interconnect the large and small diameter segments and are effective to block internal drive channels 22 in the housing in which drive rollers 26 of the spider assembly are mounted, to thereby prevent inadvertent removal of the spider assembly from the housing.
