# Apparatus and method for constructing and disassembling a truss structure.

## Abstract
Apparatus and method for constructing and disassemb ling a triangular prism form truss structure 100 in space are disclosed. The apparatus includes a triangular prism form construction fixture and three feed units disposed about the fixture for feeding the triangular frame elements 1 9 that form the basic unit of the structure 100 , or for removing the elements 1 9 from the structure 100 . The construction method, essentially automatic, comprises feeding frame elements 1 9 to the fixture from the frame units in sequence. Fixture forward and backward movement along the fixture longitudinal axis, before and after element feeding, effects fastening of the frame elements 1 9 to one another. Shifting of completed truss structure 100 sections relative to the fixture is accomplished by periodic axial movement of the fixture. The disassembly method essential ly comprises the reverse sequence of the steps of the construction method.
