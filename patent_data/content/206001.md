## Description
Title Method of and furnace for melting glass This invention is concerned with improvements relating to the melting of glass, particularly by the use of cold top furnaces. In the manufacture of glass or the like heat fuseable vitreous materials hereinafter included in the term glass for convenience of reference conventionally there is used a furnace herein referred to as being of the kind specified comprising a furnace chamber containing a body of molten glass, heating means for heating the body of molten glass, and outlet means through which glass is conducted from the chamber. Conveniently, the body of molten glass is heated electrically, using Joule effect heating, said heating means comprising a plurality of electrodes extending into the furnace chamber. Conventionally the fumace is open topped, allowing solid state glass batch material to be delivered into the furnace chamber onto the body of molten glass therein. In the use of such a furnace, the whole of the upper surface of the body of glass is covered by a relatively cool layer of batch material to a generally uniform thickness. The lower surface of this layer continuously melts away to join the body of the molten glass in the chamber, whilst molten glass is withdrawn from outlet means, advantageously from a lower portion of the chamber, whilst fresh batch material in continually spread over the upper surface to replace the melted material. It is in practice desirable to retain the thickness of the layer of batch material substantially constant, or within upper and lower limits, which depend upon the chemical and physical nature of the mixture of row matrials included in the batch material, the temperture of the body of molten glass, and the specific rate of melting of the lower surface of the layer. In the production of a particular glass, only very limited adjustment of the chemical and physical nature of the raw materials if feasible, and the production of glass of satisfactory quality depends upon maintaining the body of molten glass at a substantially constant temperature. Thus, the need to maintain the layer of batch material imposes limitotions on the rate of removal of glass from the furnace. For example with a particular type of glass being produced, and with a specific furnace, the ratio of the highest and lowest rates of removal which can be tolerated known as the production range is limited. In many glass manufacturing operations, even when producing only a single glass composition, it is highly desirable to increase the production range. In addition, some furnaces are required to melt two or more types of glass each having different characteristics with respect of the formation of the layer of botch material, which further effects the flexibility of a specific furnace. In the specification of U.K. Patent No. 1 542 278 there is described a furnace of the kind specified, having means for varying the area of molten glass which is exposed for the reception of batch material, together with feeding mechanism to deliver batch material to the furnace chamber, and which is capable of delivering batch material of the whole of the surface of molten glass, and which has associated therewith control means which is operative to restrict the area of the molten glass to which the feeding mechanism delivers solid state material. In the embodiments described and illustrated in said specification, the barrier means may be provided by a roof structure, or by ceramic tiles which may be positioned on the body of molten glass in the fumace chamber. However the furnace described in said specification is at times limited in its reliability and or versatility. In addition it may at times be desirable to increase the temperature at which the furnace is operating, to achieve a superior refining of the melted glass than would otherwise be provided, without the necessity for increasing the rate of production of melted glass, and or reducing the thickness the blanket of batch material. According to this invention there is provided a method of melting glass involving the use of a glass melting furnace of the kind specified, in which heat is removed from the material within the furnace at a region adjacent to the interface between the molten glass and the blanket of batch material. In this manner, the temperature of the molten glass in said region may be reduced, reducing the rate at which batch material is melted, enabling the following operational advantages to be obtained a the fumace may be operated at a lower pull rate without reduction to the operating temperature of the furnace and hence without a reduction fo the refining of the glass b the temperature of the furnace may be increased, increasing the extent of refining of the glass, without increasing the pull rate and without detriment to the blanket of batch material c combination of a and b . Advantageously the heat is removed from the body of molten glass at a region immediately below the fusion layer. The heat may be removed over selected areas, or generally over the whole of the area, other than desirably areas immediately adjacent to the walls of the furnace. According to this invention there is also provided a glass melting furnace of the kind specified, comprising means which may be operated to remove heat from the material within the furnace at a region adjacent to the interface between the molten glass and the blanket of batch material. Preferably said means is operative over one or more horizontally extending areas, preferably in a region immediately below the fusion layer.Preferably said means is selectively operable, advantageously both in the sense of varying the rate at which heat is removed from said area, and in relation to the area over which heat is removed. Advantageously said means comprises a pipe system through which cooling fluid may be ducted, and which is or may be positioned in the furnace at a desired heightwise position. Advantageously the pipe system is a multipass system and is operative when cooling fluid is ducted therethrough to remove heat from an area of the body of molten glass immediately below the interface thereof with a blanket of batch material. Desirably the furnace comprises a plurality of pipe systems, one or more of which may be operated selectively to remove heat from the furnace in such a manner, operation of a selected number of said plurality permitting variations in the extent of the area from which heat is removed. Desirably said plurality included two pipe systems which extend in directions generally parallel to the axis of the primary movement of glass through the furnace, one on either side of said axis. There will now be given a detailed description, to be read with reference to the accompanying drawing, of a glass melting furnace which is a preferred embodiment of this invention, and which has been selected for the purposes of illustrating the invention by way of example. In the accompanying drawings FIGURE I is schematic plan view of the preferred embodiment FIGURE 2 is a schematic representation of a pipe system of the preferred embodiment. The glass melting furnace which is the preferred embodiment of this invention is a typical small, cold topped furnace, comprising verticallyextending side walls 10 and a bottom wall 14 defining an open top furnace chamber 16. Extending through the bottom walls 14 is a plurality of vertical electrodes El to E4, and extending into the bottom wall is an outlet channel 17, through which molten glass is drawn, conventionally to a refining chamber. The melting furnace is part of a glass melting plant comprising also a feeding mechanism for the delivery of raw glass making materials in solid state form referred to herein as glass batch material to the furnace chamber 16 through the open top thereof, in a manner such that the batch material lies on the top of the body of molten glass within the furnace chamber, to be progressively melted. Mounted above the open top of the fumace, one either side of the axis of primary movement of the glass through the furnace A in Figure I are two pipe systems 18, 20, each comprising a double pass of mild steel, connected to a water pumping device by high duty rubber hoses 22. During normal operation of the furnace, the pipe systems play no part, but if at any stage it becomes desirable to reduce the pull rate of the furnace, the supply of electricity to the electrodes El to E4 is temporarily switched off, and one or both pipe systems, dependent upon the extent of the reduction desired, are lowered through the blanket of batch material into operative positions just within the body of molten glass, a short distance e,g. mm below the transitional zone at which melting of the batch material normally tokes place. Both pipe systems are spaced from the furnance walls, so as to avoid thermal shock thereto. Almost immediately a layer of glass begins to solidify on the pipes, reaching a thickness typically in the order of 25 mm, protecting the pipes from corrosion, reducing the temperature gradiant to which they will be subject, and effectively insulating them as conductors of electricity. With the re esfablishment of electric power, and the supply of water through the pipes, horizontally extending rafts of cooled, high viscosity glass are formed over areas coextensive with the pipe systems, reducing the rate at which batch material is melted by the transference of heat from the body of molten glass to the underside of the batch blanket. For example, the furnace which is the preferred embodiment of this invention has a melt area of 3.2m2, normally producing high quality soda lime cosmetic ware at lû tld ton per day with a specific loading delivery of batch of 3.125 t m 2 d, having a batch cover of 260 mm. The cold face temperature of the batch is approximately 1600c, resulting in surface losses of 2.4 kW m 2 Were the pull rate to be reduced to 5 t d, the specific loading would be reduced to 1.56 t m 2 d. However since the temperature of the body of molten glass could not be reduced to any significant extent, the melt rate would exceed the pull rate, resulting in a reduction in the blanket thickness to about 10 mm, at which equilibrium would be re established with a surface heat loss rate of 38.5 kW m2. However by the use of the present invention, when the two pipe systems are lowered into the body of molten glass, the effective melt area is reduced by 20 , increasing the specific loading at 5 t d from 1.56 to 1.95 t m 2 equivalent to a pull rate of 6.24 t d at the original melt area . The reduced area available for heat transfer to the batch reduces the melt rate generally to the pull rate, resulting in a substantial restoration of botch cover and a consequential reduction of surface losses to 7.9 kW m2. Although the coolant in the two circuits results in a total heat extraction of 44 kW, this is more than off set by a reduction in surface losses convection and radiation from 38.5 kW m2 to 7.9 kW m2 at 5 t d. Moreover, this embodiment enables high quality ware to be melted at a hitherto impractically low pull rate, dramatically increasing the flexibility of the melting system. It will be appreciated that pipe systems may be arranged in a wide variety of configurations to meet preferred specific loadings, and, when operative, the charging patterns will be varied to accomodate the different rate of melting of batch material over different areas of the furnace. It has been found that pipe systems which comprise mild steel pipes and which are cooled by water function perfectly satisfactorily, with the protective coating of solid glass which becomes deposited thereon. It may be desired to coat the pipe with a protective material such as silica tube, but it is not believed that this would be necessary.
