# Arrangement for guiding and shifting a carriage of an office machine.

## Abstract
The carriage of a digital document reader is shifted by means of a pair of worms 27 rotatable in the frame and engag ing two nuts borne by the carriage. The worms are rotated simultaneously, e.g. by a single stepping motor and a toothed belt engaging a pulley 66 , or by two separate stepping mo tors. For the purpose of reducing inertia, each worm 27 is formed together with the driving pulley 66 by moulding a lay er 79 of plastics material on a metal core tube 74 which is formed with a shallow groove 78 of coarse pitch to anchor the plastics layer 79 . Each nut, also of plastics material, is formed with a series of axial notches which define an equal number of elastic sectors which allow any play on the worm due to wear to be taken up.
