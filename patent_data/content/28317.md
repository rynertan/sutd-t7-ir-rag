# Production of fructose and useful by products.

## Abstract
In the disclosed process for obtaining fructose solutions or solid fructose, a raw material containing sucrose and or similar fructofuranosides is hydrolyzed to fructose and glucose and treated with a calcium base e.g. calcium oxide or hydroxide to precipitate calcium sugar complexes. The precipitate is slurried in water and then treated with phos phoric acid to liberate e.g. at a pH of 5.5 to 9 a fructose solution of high purity i.e. de complex the calcium fructose complex , with precipitation of useful calcium phosphate salts. Phosphoric acid has been found to have significant advantages over carbonic acid or carbon dioxide as the fructose liberating de complexing agent, e.g. better yields and more useful by products. Solid fructose can be obtained from the fructose solution in a known manner. The filtrate from the calcium sugar complexing step can be acidified to yield stable, useful, fructose depleted by products.
