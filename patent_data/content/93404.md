# Process for preparing tetrafluoroethylene fluoro alkyl vinyl ether copolymer.

## Abstract
A process for preparing a tetrafluoroethylene fluoro al kyl vinyl ether copolymer comprising polymerizing tetra fluoroethylene and fluoro alkyl vinyl ether in an aqueous suspension system which comprises a mixed medium of water and a fluorohydrocarbon or a chlorofluorohydrocar bon in a volume ratio of from 1 1 to 10 1 at a temperature of from 0 to 25 C in the presence of a polymerization initiator of the formula Cl CFâ‚‚
