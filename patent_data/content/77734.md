# PRODUCTION OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AGAINST BACTERIAL ADHESINS

## Abstract
Monoclonal antibodies specific for surface antigens of bacteria which act as adhesins between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and, in particular, K 99 pili, and methods for production thereof are described. These monoclonal anti bodies may be used for the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of diseases induced by adhesin bearing pathogens in animals and humans, and for the diagnostic identification of adhesin bearing bacteria.
