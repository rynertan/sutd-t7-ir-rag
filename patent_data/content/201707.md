# Autoresonant Piezoelectric transformer signal coupler.

## Abstract
A piezoelectric transformer signal coupler utilizes a drive circuit 20 including an oscillator constructed to excite the primary of a piezoelectric transformer 10 at its characteris tic anti resonant frequency. Positive feedback signals mod ulated by the time domain response characteristic of the particular piezoelectric transformer 10 force the oscillator to lock onto its characteristic anti resonant frequency despite variations thereof due to temperature drift and secondary loading. The resulting drive circuit 20 is implementable as a miniature, low mass integrated circuit mountable on the transformer s piezoceramic wafer 12 to create a signal coupler of a single integrated structure.
