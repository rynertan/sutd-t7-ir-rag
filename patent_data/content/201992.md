# Method and apparatus for plating and coating and articles so produced.

## Abstract
Method for the coating of a substrate under vacuum conditions firstly with non oxidized plating material 108 which is deposited on the substrate 100 via ion vapour deposition and secondly with a coating material 112, 114 is chemically bonded with the non oxidized plating material. The coating material may comprise a primer 112 , which chemically bonds with the non oxidized plating material 108 , and a polymer 114 which impregnates the primer prepared plating material. Said polymer 114 may also chemically bond with the primer 112 . Alternatively, the coating material may comprise an epoxy which forms an organo metallic bond with the plating material. The coating material may also comprise boron trifluoride, which chemically bonds with the non oxidized plating material, and a polymer, which impregnates the boron trifluoride prepared plating material. Alternatively, the coating material may comprise calcium, silicon, and oxygen which chemically bonds with the plating material. The coating material may be bifunctional, in that it not only chemically bonds with the plating material but also bonds with a second coating material, yielding a chemically bonded uniform coating with desired results.
