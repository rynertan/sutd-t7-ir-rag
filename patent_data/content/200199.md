## Description
ELECTRIC LAMP WITH IMPROVED SELF MOUNTING PRAME MEMBER CROSS REFERENCE TO COPENDING APPLICATiONS Zn copending United States Patent Application, SerialNo. 469.841, filed February 25, 1983, by Blaisdell et al.assigned to GTE Products Corporation, a frame assembly for mounting a light source capsule within an outer envelope of an electric lamp is disclosed. TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to electric lamps and more particularly to such lamps having a self mounting frame member for supporting a light source capsule within an outer envelope. BACKGROUND ART Under the existing art. the manufacture of a doubleenveloped electric lamp typically involves the following steps. A light source capsule having two lead in wires is mounted on a glass stem support. The capsule and stem are inserted into the outer envelope. The glass stem support is flame sealed to the glass outer envelope. The outer envelope is evacuated, a desired fill gas may be introduced into the outer envelope. and the outer envelope is hermetically sealed.A lamp base is mounted on and cemented to the neck of the outer envelope. One of the capsule lead in wires is soldered to the insulated tip of the base. The second lead in wire is soldered or welded to the outer shell of the base. The described manufacturing process is relatively costly.The fabrication of a hermetic seal between the lead in wires and glass stem and between the stem and outer envelope requires considerable technological skill and quality control. A solution to the aforementioned problem is described in the above referenced copending Application Serial No. 469.841 , which is a dual envelope electric lamp having a self mounting frame member for supporting a light source capsule within an outer envelope. The frame assembly secured to the neck portion of the outer envelope by mounting means.which form part of the frame assembly, and a base that makes contact with mounting means and is mounted onto the neck portion see FIG. 4B . The frame assemblies described therein are comprised of more than one structural element. In United States Patent No. 4,500.948. One Piece Frame ForAn Electric Lamp. issued to Blaisdell et al on February 19.1985, replacement frame assemblies are described therein which are comprised of a single element, such as a single sheet of material or a single strand of wire that are formed into the requisite shape see FIG. 4A . The contents of U.S. Patent No. 4,500.948 is hereby incorporated by reference. In an electric lamp using a single wire frame assembly with a screw on type base Edison type . an undesirable twist or rotational movement in the frame assembly arose while mounting the base onto the outer envelope. Such a twist could later cause weaknesses to develop at points where the capsule is mounted onto the frame assembly. In addition, the formation of cross axis grooves see FIG. 4B on the end of the outer envelope to accommodate the frame assembly is a potential source of shrinkage or waste due to cracking during assembly of the lamp. It is believed. therefore, that a dual envelope electric lamp which can be manufactured by a simpler process, assembled with less shrinkage and provides means for substantially preventing rotational movement in the frame assembly during mounting of the base to the outer envelope would constitute an advancement in the art. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION Therefore. it is a primary object of this invention to enhance the art of electric lamps and particularly such lamps having a frame member for supporting a light source capsule within an outer envelope. It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved self mounting frame member for a dual envelope electric lamp that includes means for substantially preventing rotational movement of the frame member upon mounting of a base member on a neck portion of the outer envelope. In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an electric lamp having an outer envelope including a neck portion and a frame member with mounting means as part thereof positioned within the outer envelope and mounted on the neck portion using elastic and frictional forces. A light source capsule is mounted on a portion of the frame member and is located within the outer envelope a base member is mounted on the neck portion in contact with mounting means of the frame member. The improvement in the electric lamp comprises the inclusion of means for substantially preventing rotational movement of the frame member when the frame member is mounted and secured by the base member.Rotational movement preventing means is located about the neck portion and is in operative contact with the base member.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Por a better understanding of the present invention.together with other and further objects. advantages and capabilities thereof. reference is made to the following disclosure and appended claims taken in conjunction with the above described drawings. As used herein. the term light source capsule denotes a halogen capsule of a tungsten halogen incandescent lamp, an arc tube of an arc discharge lamp or any light emitting capsule within the outer envelope of a lamp. The term Âµelastic herein is defined as the property of a body. when deformed. to return to its normal configuration automatically as the deforming forces are removed. The term friction herein is defined to be the force which opposes relative motion between two touching bodies caused by the respective properties of the surfaces of each body which are in contact with each other. Neither elastic nor friction as used herein shall include any force which opposes relative motion between two bodies caused by the fusion of one body with the other. such fusion including any glass to glass or glass to metal seal. Referring to the drawings with greater particularity,FIG. 1 shows one embodiment of the invention. being lamp 10 having a longitudinal axis L and comprising an outer envelope 20, a light source capsule 22, a frame member 24. a base member 26 and a neck portion 28. Frame member 24 has mounting means 24A and 24B as part thereof that will slidably engage neck portion 28. Capsule 22 in this instance is a tungsten halogen incandescent capsule with a first lead in wire 30. a second lead in wire 32, and a tungsten filament 34 extending between the internal terminations of lead in wires 30 and 32. Capsule 22 in this embodiment is mounted on frame member 24 by means of lead in wire 30. PIGS. 2 and 3 illustrate neck portion 28 having two diametrically opposed pairs of interconnecting grooves. 34 and 36. In FIG. 2, groove 34 comprises connecting grooves 38 and 40 while groove 36 comprises connecting grooves 50 and 51.Grooves 38 and 50 are formed on outside surface 44 of neck portion 28 and run from a grooveless brim 42 to grooves 40 and 51, respectively. Neck portion 28 also has an inside surface 45. Grooves 40 and 51 both point in the direction of advancing thread 46. i.e., in the direction of rotation of base member 26 when it is mounted on neck portion 28. Neck portion 28 has thread 46 formed therein the thread extends approximately from brim 42 to ridge 48. Thread 46 is matched with the inside thread of base member 26 such that base member 26 may be mounted by being screwed onto neck portion 28. Groove 38 is formed into outside surface 44 and thread 46. Groove 38 proceeds from brim 42 toward ridge 48 running parallel to central axis L and traversing thread 46 until groove 38 meets groove 40. Groove 40 is formed in outside surface 44 and thread 46 it is perpendicular to groove 38 it proceeds from groove 38 in the direction that thread 46 advances toward ridge 48. Referring now to FIGS. 4A and 4B. in FIG. 4A there is illustrated a pictorial view of a one piece frame member 52 which is described in issued U.S. Patent No. 4,500,948 toBlaisdell et al. The description of the frame members1 including that of frame member 52. is hereby incorporated by reference. In FIG. 4B, frame member 52 is shown in position in the neck C of an outer envelope. Neck C has a cross axis groove. designated by C1 and C2. formed in the brim D which partially secure frame member 52. In order to fully secure such a frame member. a base member is placed about neck C and twisted on over the legs 62 and 64 of frame member 52 until contact is made with a ridge similar to ridge 48.Unfortunately. as also illustrated in FIG. 4B, frame member 52 exhibits a permanent stressed deformation Y Y invisible lines and arrows when the base member is screwed on neck C.The rotation of frame member 52 in turn twists light source capsule 22 and causes stress forces to center on the capsule lead wire connections. Eliminating both the undesirable twist in the frame member and the need for a cross axis groove would increase overall lamp life and diminish a potential source of shrinkage due to cracking during assembly of the lamp. The present invention provides for an electric lamp with a light source capsule mounted on a frame member therein. having means for substantially preventing rotational movement of the frame member when the frame member is mounted and secured by a base member. FIGS. 5A and 5B and 6A and 6B illustrate two embodiments of the present invention and views of the frame members positioned properly within neck portion 28. As seen inFIGS. 1 through 3, each of the frame members 90 and 120 to be described here slidably engages neck portion 28 of outer envelope 20 and is secured by base member 26 being screwed onto neck portion 28. Frame member 24 in FIG. 1 is also a representation of what the other frame members to be described 90 and 120 will look like once they ve been mounted in a lamp. In the first embodiment FIG.5 . means for substantially preventing rotational movement of the frame member includes grooveless brim 42 on neck portion 28 of envelope 20. two diametrically opposed pairs of interconnecting grooves. 34 and 36, formed in outer surface 44 and a frame member 90 having mounting means as part thereof. In FIG. 5A. frame member 90 has legs 92 and 94, a loop 96, a bridge 98 interconnecting legs 92 and 94 and mounting means comprised of feet 100 and 102. Foot 100 is comprised of connected segments 104. 108 and 112, and foot 102 is comprised of connected segments 106. 110 and 114. Loop 96 provides both a mount for the light source capsule and a reciprocating force when frame member 90 i6 under a compressive force within neck portion 28. Frame member 90 is positioned in contact with inner surface 45 with mounting means positioned about brim 42 and mated with pairs of interconnecting grooves 34 and 36.Specifically, legs 92 and 94 contact opposite sides of inner surface 45. segments 104 and 106 are in contact with brim 42, segments 108 and 110 mate with grooves 38 and 50. respectively, and segments 112 and 114 are mated with and protrude tangentially from grooves 40 and 51. respectively. Feet 100 and 102 are held securely within interconnecting grooves 34 and 36 by mounted Edison type screw on base member 26. FIG. 5B illustrates frame member 90 positioned within envelope 20 and mounted on neck portion 28 when viewed up through portion 28 and loop 96 here represents the rest of frame member 90 when viewed in this manner. Legs 92 and 94 are positioned in contact with inner surface 45 of neck portion 28 with segments 104 and 106 being normal to loop 96. Inner surface 45 opposes any movement of legs 92 and 94 when a force is applied to segments 112 and 114 in directions X and X .Having segments 104 and 106 normal to loop 96 results in less rotational force being applied to legs 92 and 94 in the instance where the mounting of frame member 90 is loose inside neck portion Z8. Base number 26 exerts elastic and frictional forces on frame member 90 during mounting such that legs 92 and 94 press against inner surface 45 without rotational forces being exerted on the portion of frame member 90 within envelope 20. FIGS. 6A and 6B illustrate a pictorial view and a view through neck portion 28 of another embodiment of the present invention. Particularly, means for preventing rotational movement here includes the neck and envelope construction of the previous embodiment, such as grooveless brim 42 and grooves 34 and 36 in neck portion 28 of envelope 20 partially illustrated in PIG. 6B . FIG. 6A illustrates frame member 120 having legs 122 and 124, a loop 126, a bridge 128 interconnecting legs 122 and 124 and mounting means comprised of feet 130 and 132. Frame member 120 is positioned in contact with inner surface 45 with mounting means positioned about brim 42 and mated with interconnecting grooves 34 and 36. Legs 122 and 124 contact sides of inner surface 45. extend to opposite sides of surface 45 of neck portion 28 and are in contact with brim 42.Legs 122 and 124 form an opening 134 which allows passage of a current carrying wire to the light source capsule. In FIG. 6B. legs 122 and 124 are shown lying in the same plane and will oppose each other to eliminate any rotational movement when a force is applied in directions X and to feet 130 and 132. Feet 130 and 132 are held securely within interconnecting grooves 34 and 36 by mounted Edison type screw on base member 26. Base member 26 exerts elastic and frictional forces on frame member 120 during mounting such that legs 122 and 124 are pressed against each other with substantially equal and opposite forces without rotational forces being exerted on the portion of frame member 120 located within outer envelope 20. The portion of legs 122 and 124 about opening 34 can also be welded together if desired, but a single piece. unwelded design is less costly and allows for speedier production. The frame members of the present invention are sufficiently rigid to provide support for mounting the light source thereon and can be formed from a single strand of electrically conductive wire resulting in a one piece body . The frame members may include locking means for securedly engaging the frame member, the base member and the outer envelope. Locking means includes forming feet 100 and 102 or 130 and 132 of frame members 90 and 120, respectively with sharp tips that will become embedded into base member 26 if rotated in the direction of dismounting. Once base member 26 is fully mounted. base member 26 is locked in place. While there have been shown what are at present considered to be the preferred embodimen ts of the invention. it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made herein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
