# Process for preparing a hydrogel.

## Abstract
A hydrogel which has a water content of 20 to 92 weight and which is stable and superior in mechanical properties is obtained by preparing a 3 to 25 weight aqueous solution of a polyvinyl alcohol having a degree of hydrolysis not less than 95 mol and a viscosity average polymerization degree of not less than 1,500, pouring the aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solution into a desired shape of a vessel or a mold, freeze molding the aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solution at a temperature lower than 6 C, thereafter dehydrating the molded article without thawing it until the dehydration percentage reaches 5 weight or more and, if required, immersing the dehydrated product in water.
