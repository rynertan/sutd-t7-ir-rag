# Pressure responsive panel.

## Abstract
An instrument adapted to make assessments in sensory evaluation comprises two wafers which are separated by spacer means 3 and are provided on their opposing faces with conductive patterns 4, 5 . Upon use, the instrument is connected to a computer which activates one conductor 5 at a time on one side of the instrument and senses if one or more of the conductors 4 on the other side of the instrument are activated, i.e. if a person is exerting a pressure, for exam ple by means of finger, at some point or other on the instru ment. The special design of the conductive patterns makes it possible to convert the analog position of the pressure into a digital signal which is fed directly into the computer.
