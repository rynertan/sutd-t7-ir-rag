# Loop transmission system.

## Abstract
A token passing type loop transmission system includ ing a plurality of node stations 100, 200 ... and first and second loop transmission lines 40, 50 , which lines transmit signals in opposite directions. Each node station 100, 200, ... includes a first and second loop back circuit 121, 122 221, 222 ... and a ring control circuit RCS . The ring control circuit monitors signals passing through the node station, changes end paths in the first and second loop back circuits 121, 122 to operatively connect the first and second loop transmission lines 40, 50 or to restore the first and second loop transmission lines to a normal state in each loop back circuit, and transmits a signal on the first or second loop transmission line 40, 50 through the first or second loop back circuit 121, 122 . By a combination of operations of the plurality of node stations 100, 200, ... , the loop transmission system per forms automatic loop configuration control of detection of a fault point therein and constructs a transmission loop line not including the fault point.
