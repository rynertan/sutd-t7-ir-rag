# Magnetic disc memory apparatus incorporating temperature compensation.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a disc drive system in which a head 2 is moved relative to a disc 4 for reading writing on the disc by a carrier 6 to which the head is connected by a flexure 10 through an E block 8 . A stepper motor has a drive shaft with a pulley 12 carrying a drive band 14 having an inner portion 16 attached to the pulley and a free end secured to the carriage 6 to displace the carriage and thereby the head across the surface of the disc from track to track. Correction for mis tracking due to thermal expansion con traction of the components is achieved by the incorporation of a compensating plate 20 in the mechanism between the drive band 18 and E block 8 , the length of the plate and coefficient of expansion of the plate being selected to nullify any off track shift with temperature. Also mis tracking, which varies from the outside to the inside track, i.e., there is a change in stroke length of the carriage with temperature, is compensated for by selecting a pulley material for the drive pulley 12 to have a coefficient of expansion directly related to the coefficient of expansion of the material of the disc 4 . Thus any change in size with ambient temperature of the disc is correlated with a change in size of the same temperature of that part of the band 14 around the pulley 12 so that the total effect is as close to a nullity as possible.
