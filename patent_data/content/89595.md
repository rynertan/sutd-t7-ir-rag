# Method to cut off a preferably band shaped running web of tearable material and means to carry out the method.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a method to cut off a preferably band shaped running web 1 of tearable material and to feed an end 1D of a web of material to a reel 5 , round which the web 1 of material shall be wound and on which it shall be supported respectively. The invention also relates to a means, which is suitable for carrying out said method. The invention makes possible that a web 1 of material in a rapid and effective manner can be cut off, and than an end 1D of a web of material can be brought to a reel, and the invention can also be applied to already existing machines thereby obtaining their automatic function. The method is carried out in such a manner that the web 1 of material is certain distance from the two respective lateral edges 1A, 1B of the web, preferably at the centre portion 18 of the web by means of a cutting off apparatus 8, 15 , provided with a point, is perforated, said cutting off apparatus in relation to the web 1 of material moving at a speed, which is lower than the speed of the feed of the web of material, so that the web 1 of material during its continued forward feed is torn apart from the area 22 of said perforation in direction to said two edges 1A, 1B of the web of material, and that the free end 1D of the web of material thus cut off is guided by said cutting off apparatus 8, 15 so that it is introduced between the reel 5 and the portion 1 of the web of material running to the reel 5 .
