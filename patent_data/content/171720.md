# Data delay memory circuit.

## Abstract
A data delay memory circuit includes clock controlled data latch circuits formed with cascade connected clocked inverters I1 I7 . The data delay memory circuit also includes a clock generator CG for supplying the clocked inverters I1 I7 with clock signals 1 7,
