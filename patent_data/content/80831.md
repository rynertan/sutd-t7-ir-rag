# Improvements in or relating to engine mountings.

## Abstract
A journal bearing 17 is provided between the engine block 11 and transmission casing 13 of a motor vehicle engine and transmission unit. The bearing maintains the engine and transmission in driving alignment, torque reac tion from the block 11 being taken by engine mountings 18 and torque reaction from the casing 13 by transmission mountings 20 .

## Description
IEROVEMENI S IN OR RELATING TO ENGINE MOUNTINGS This invention relates to engine mountings particularly though not exclusively for motor vehicles. In motor vehicles engine mountings usually incorporate a rubber component to insulate the body structure from engine vibration. Front engine front wheel drive vehicles commonly use the engine mountings to react final drive torque to the vehicle body. In order to make motor vehicle travel more comfortable, designers have been seeking to reduce noise levels in the passenger compartment and particular attention has been paid to engine mountings.This study, commonly known under the heading ofN.V.H. noise, vibration and harshness has become quite important. One way of reducing N.V.H. transmissions to the body structure is to adopt softer engine mountings.Unfortunately this increases engine movement under drive torque reaction and so requires greater space in the engine bay and more flexible hose and cable connections. A further disadvantage of soft mountings, especially in small vehicles, is that they promote an undesirable phenomenon termed shunt where movement of the engine is noticeable to the vehicle driver and can adversely affect driveability of the vehicle see for example AUTOCAR 17th October, 1981, Page 17 . Thus engine mountings are presently called upon to perform two tasks, reaction of final drive torque which requires relatively hard mountings and reduction of N.V.H. transmissions which requires relatively soft mountings, The present invention seeks to overcome the aforementioned problems by substantially relieving the engine mountings of one task. This consequently enables the mountings to be optimised for the remaining task. One way of carrying this into effect is to utilise a short universally jointed shaft between an engine and gearbox, the gearbox mountings reacting final drive torque. This solution has been proposed for buses but is impractical for front engine, front wheel drive cars because of the space required. According to the present invention there is provided a motor vehicle engine and transmission unit having resilient mountings for supporting the unit in a vehicle body to both react final drive torque and cushion the unit in the body characterised thereby that a journal bearing is effectively provided between the engine block and transmission casing to maintain the engine and transmission in driving alignment, independent sets of mountings being provided for the engine and transmission. By transmission is meant the usual clutch gearbox and final drive unit associated with front wheel drive vehicles. Other features of the invention are included in the following description of a preferred embodiment shown, by way of example only, in the accompanying drawing which is a part sectional plan view of an improved engine mounting arrangement according to the invention. An engine transmission unit suitable for a front wheel drive car comprises the engine 11, clutch housing 12, gearbox 13, differential gear 14 and driveshafts 15,16. A rolling element bearing 17 connects the clutch housing 12 to the casing of the of the gearbox 13. This arrangement ensures accurate alignment between the gearbox and clutch housing whilst relieving the engine mountings of the task of drive line torque reaction. Thus the engine mountings 18 can be made of relatively soft rubber to minimise N.V.H. transmissions to the body structure 19 whilst the gearbox mountings 20 can be made of relatively hard rubber to react final drive torque whilst limiting gearbox movement. Clearly some slight N.V.H. transmission from the engine 11 through the bearing 17, gearbox 13 and mountings 20 may be inevitable, but the proposed arrangement offers a substantially improvement over existing mounting layouts. Careful design can minimiseN.V.H. transmission through the bearing 17 to an absolute minimum. The engine block will react engine torque indirectly through the gas in each cylinder, so the present invention avoids direct connection and substantially relieves the drive line of the inertial load of the block thus reducing or eliminating shunt. The typical ratio of torque reaction to the mountings in first gear is about 15 1. The bearing 17 has been described as between the clutch housing 12 and gearbox 13. It could be placed elsewhere, for example between the clutch housing 12 and the engine 11, so long as adequate mountings for reacting final drive torque are provided.
