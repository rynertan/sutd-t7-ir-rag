# Apparatus and method for degaussing magnetic storage media.

## Abstract
In accordance with one form of the invention, a magnetic storage medium e.g. disc pack 250 to be degaussed is placed in a coil 200 having a central open region sufficiently large to receive the entire magnetic storage medium. The coil is ener gized to obtain a current therein in one direction to produce a first magnetic field of a first polarity in the region. The coil is then energized to obtain a current therein in the opposite direction to produce in the region a second magnetic field of opposite polarity. The minimum strength of the magnetic fields should be at least 500 oersetds, and preferably about 1500 oersteds. In another form of the invention, a reel of magnetic tape 350 is simultaneously rotated on its axis and subjected to an applied transverse magnetic field, substan tially in the plane of the reel, the transverse magnetic field being obtained using a lateral coil 140 which passes over and under the reel and covers about half the reel. The trans verse magnetic field is applied first in one direction and then in the opposite direction. An axial magnetic field, substan tially parallel to the axis of the reel, is then applied, first in one direction and then in the opposite direction, the axial magne tic field being obtained using a ring shaped coil 150 sur rounding the periphery of the reel. In the preferred embodi ment, the step of applying an axial magnetic field includes applying axial magnetic fields in alternating directions at suc cessively decreasing amplitudes.
