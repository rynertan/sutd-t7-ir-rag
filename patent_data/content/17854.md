# Antiblocking copolymer composition, use of same as viscosity index improving agent in lubricating oils and lubricating oil composition.

## Abstract
A normally solid thermoplastic material having a low softening point containing at least one metal salt of a metal selected from the group consisting of a metal of Group I, II, III or IV of the Periodic Table and a fatty acid having about 8 to about 30 carbon atoms per molecule and a sili cone compound incorporated into or onto the thermoplas tic material, the metal salt and the silicone compound be ing present in amounts sufficient to significantly reduce blocking between contact surfaces of the thermoplastic material and a lubricating composition containing the ther moplastic material.
