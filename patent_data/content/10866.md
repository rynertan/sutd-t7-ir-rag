# Homogeneous brazing foils of copper based metallic glasses.

## Abstract
Novel glassy metal alloys and the brazing of metal parts employing a homogeneous ductile filler metal foil of these alloys is disclosed. The glassy metal alloys have a composition consisting essentially of 5 to 40 atom percent nickel, 15 to 20 atom percent phosphorus with the balance being copper and incidental impurities. These alloys can be produced in the form of foil useful for brazing metal articles, particularly articles composed of copper and cop per alloys.
