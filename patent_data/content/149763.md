# ELECTROPLATING METHOD FOR CARBON FIBERS AND APPARATUS THEREFOR

## Abstract
Performing continuous electric plating of a carbon fiber strand 5 in a plating bath 11 , an electric current is supplied to the carbon fiber strand 5 in a liquid 12 or an inert gas outside the plating bath 11 and electric plating is performed in the plating bath using the carbon fiber strand 5 as the cathode. A metal coated carbon fiber strand having substantially no uneven color tone and plating defects may be obtained.
