## Description
PROCESS FOR HYDROGENATION OF SUGAR SOLUTIONSTO A HIGH MANNITOL PRODUCTBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a process for producing mannitol rich solutions of sorbitol and mannitol.More particularly. this invention relates to a process for producing a mannitol rich solution of sorbitol and mannitol from glucose, optionally in the presence of other sugars. It is well known that a. mixture of sorbitol and mannitol in aqueous solution can be produced by catalytic hydrogenation of invert sugar, which is an approximately equimolar mixture of glucose and fructose. Invert sugar, in turn, is commonly obtained by inversion of sucrose ordinary sugar . The yield of mannitol is ordinarily about 24 26 percent by weight, based on total dry solids, when hydrogenation is carried out under neutral or midly acidic conditions, such as those disclosed in U. S.Patent 2,759,024. This yield can be increased by carrying out at least part of the hydrogenation under alkaline conditions, as described in U. S. Patents 3,329,729 and 3.763 246, or by appropriate choice of catalyst, as described in U. S. Patent 3,705,199 or by combining both techniques. The processes ofU. S. Patents 3,329,729 and 3,763 246 are multi stage processes in which alkaline hydrogenation is followed by acid hydrogenation. Alkaline agents for the alkaline hydrogenation stages of those processes are alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, and alkaline earth metal oxides and hydroxides such as lime. U. S. Patent 3. 329.729 also suggests the addition of calcium carbonate as a buffering agent in addition to lime.Mannitol yields in percent by weight on the dry basis are as follows U.S. Patent 3,329,729 30 36 U. S. Patent 3,705 199 28 29 and U. S. Patent 3 763,246, 27 31 .In each case the balance of the reaction product is mostly sorbitol. Enhanced yields of mannitol under alkaline hydrogenation conditions are due to isomerization of part of the glucose present to fructose and mannose. The proportions of glucose, fructose, and mannose in the reaction mixture will vary depending on the alkaline material and the conditions used, and useful quantities of mannose are not ordinarily obtained. Such isomerization is well known in the art, and is discussed, for example in Patents 3,329,729 and 3.763,246 cited above, and in Pigman, The Carbohydrates Chemistry, Biochemistry, andPhysiology, Academic Press, New York, 1957, pages 60 69. High costs of mannose and fructose in substantially pure form preclude the economic use of these sugars as starting materials, even though mannose yields essentially pure mannitol and fructose yields a 50 50 mixture of sorbitol and mannitol on catalytic hydrogenation in neutral media. Hydrogenation of either glucose o r mannose in the presence of a platinum catalyst and considerable alkali yields a mixture of sorbitol and mannitol, according to U. S. Patent 1,990,245. This reference also states, however, that pure sorbitol is obtained when glucose is hydrogenated at a pH from 7 to 12 in the presence of a nickel catalyst. The reaction medium is made alkaline by the addition of an alkali or alkaline earth metal oxide, hydroxide. or alkaline reacting salt such as a carbonate, silicate, or borate. Other references teach that hydrogenation of glucose in the presence of a nickel catalyst yields a mixture of sorbitol and mannitol under strongly alkaline conditions pH 10 or over British Patent 1, 129, 586 , while substantially pure sorbitol is obtained under milder alkaline conditions pH 8. 3 8. 5 British Patent 1, 140, 477 .CanadianPatent 735, 972 describes catalytic hydrogenation of glucose and invert sugar to mixtures of sorbitol and mannitol in aqueous solution which is made alkaline with lime and optionally also with calcium carbonate. Glucose is hydrogenated substantially quantitatively to sorbitol under neutral or mildly acidic conditions see U. S. Patents 1,963,999 and 2,280,975. A process for obtaining sorbitol mannitol solutions from glucose by first catalytically epimerizing glucose in an acidic aqueous solution containing at least 50 by weight of glucose to obtain an epimerizate of glucose and mannose,and then catalytically hydrogenating this epimerizate to obtain an aqueous solution of sorbitol and mannitol, is described inU. S. Patent 4. 029. 878. Epimerization according to that process is carried out at elevated temperature in the presence of a hexavalent molybdenum catalyst such as molybdic acid or an anion exchange resin in the molybdate form. Hydrogenation catalysts and conditions for hydrogenating the glucose mannose epimerizate to a mixture of sorbitol and mannitol in that process are conventional.Ordinarily the epimerizate will contain about 30 e. g. about 27 33 of mannose on the dry basis, and the mol percentage of mannitol in the final product is also usually about 307o that is, the mol percentage of mannitol in the final product does not differ significantly from the mol percentage of mannose in the epimerizate. Production of sorbitol mannitol mixtures in a process which comprises the successive steps of epimerizing glucose in aqueous solution containing a hexavalent molybdenum catalyst, treating the epimerizate with glucose isomerase enzyme under isomerizing conditions, and hydrogenating the resulting sugar mixture a mixture of glucose, mannose, and fructose in aqueous solution under non alkaline conditions , is described in Japanese Patent Publication 51 75008. The product contains approximately 40 by weight dry basis of mannitol, the balance being principally sorbitol. Mannitol may be recovered from aqueous solutions containing both sorbitol and mannitol by fractional crystallization as described for example in U. S. Patent 3, 632, 656. Larger quantities of impurities are formed in processes for alkaline hydrogenation of either glucose or invert sugar than in processes for hydrogenating these materials under non alkaline conditions. There is a need for a hydrogenation process in which enhanced mannitol yields are obtained while at the same time the amounts of impurities are minimized.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has been found, according to the present invention, that a mannitol rich aqueous solution of sorbitol and mannitol is produced by hydrogenating a sugar mixture comprising glucose and at least one additional sugar selected from mannose and fructose in aqueous solution with hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst under hydrogenation conditions, the solution of the sugar mixture containing an alkali metal salt of a weak acid in sufficient quantity so that the percentage of mannitol in the mannitol rich solution exceeds the percentage of mannitol which would be obtained from hydrogenation of the sugar mixture under non isomerizing conditions. The starting materials for the process of this invention are aqueous solutions comprising glucose and mannose and or fructose. Starting materials include glucose mannose fructose solutions. The quantities of disaccharides and higher oligosaccharide in the starting solution are as small as possible, since oligosaccharides including disaccharides result in impurities in the final sorbitol mannitol product. The starting solutions should contain only small amounts, preferably not more than two percent and more preferably not more than one percent by weight on the dry basis, of oligosaccharides. Aqueous solutions of glucose with mannose are the preferred starting materials. Such solutions can be prepared by catalytic epimerization of glucose in aqueous solution.Procedures for catalytic epimerization of glucose are known in the art, and are described, for example, in U. S. Patent 4, 029, 878, in Takemura et al., Japanese Patent PublicationNo. 51 75008 1976 , and Bilik, Chem. Zvesti, 26, 183 186 1972 . According to these references, glucose is contacted with an epimerization catalyst e. g., molybdic acid under epimerization conditions, producing a solution containing a major amount on the dry basis of glucose and a minor amount of mannose. Glucose is preferably epimerized as described in U. S.Patent No. 4, 029, 878 using molybdenum compounds as catalysts.Although any of the catalysts, catalyst concentrations, temperatures, and other reaction conditions described in Patent 4, 029,878 can be used, it is preferred to epimerize glucose in a 50 to 70 by weight aqueous solution which also contains molybdic acid in an amount of about 0. 25 percent by weight, based on the initial weight of glucose, and which has a pH of about 3. 5 4, at temperatures of about 90 100 C. and at atmospheric pressure for about 3 hours. The epimerized glucose products obtained under these conditions usually contain about 25 32 percent by weight of mannose, from a trace up to about 2 percent by weight of oligosaccharides including disaccharides , balance essentially glucose1 on the dry basis.Epimerization temperatures in the 90 100 C. range give epimerizates containing smaller amounts of disaccharides than those obtained at higher temperatures. Disaccharide formation can be held to a minimum about 0. 5 percent by weight or less on the dry basis by using epimerization temperatures below about 95 C. Mannitol yields obtained at temperatures below 95 C. are slightly lower about 25 28 percent dry basis than those obtained at 95 100 C. however, the smaller amounts of disaccharides result in a final sorbitol mannitol product of higher quality.Catalyst concentrations greater or less than 0. 25 percent, an reaction times which are either longer or shorter than 3 hours, can be used the amounts of mannose and disaccharides in the epimerizate are less sensitive to small changes in catalyst concentration and reaction time than to small changes in temperature. Alternatively, one may use the procedure described by V. Bilik in Chem. Zvesti, 26, 183 186 1972 . Bilik describes a procedure in which a 25 percent yield of mannose at equilibrium is obtained by epimerizing at 90 C. an aqueous solution containing about 17 percent by weight of glucose i. e., 20 grams of glucose per 100 ml of water and also containing dissolved molybdic acid in an amount of 1 percent based on glucose i. e., 200 mg per 100 ml of water .Epimerization according to the process of Patent 4,029.878, rather than according to Bilik s process, is preferred because, first, a higher yield of mannose is obtained in that process, and secondly, because the higher solids concentrations used in that process make it unnecessary to handle or to evaporate large qualntities of water in subsequent process steps. The glucose mannose solution obtained on epimerization is purified in order to remove the molybdenum catalyst, other ions, and coloured impurities. This may be done by contacting the solution with a cation exchange resin and an anion exchange resin, and with one or more adsorbents, such as an adsorbent resin, activated carbon, or both. The epimerizate solution is preferably diluted with water where necessary to a solids content of about 50 607 prior to treatment. The preferred cation exchange resins are strongly acid resins, such as Permutit Q 4 sulfonated styrene divinylbenzene resin made by Permutit Co. division ofSybron Corp., Paramus, New Jersey.The preferred anion exchange resin is Amberlite XE 275 resin, a weakly basic macroreticular acrylic resin having tertiary amine functionality made by Rohm and Haas Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Examples of suitable decolorizing materials are Duolite S 30 resin, which is made by Diamond Shamrock Chemical Corporation of Redwood City, California, and Darco S 51 activated carbon which is made by ICI Americas Inc. of Wilmington, Delaware. A preferred treatment procedure comprises treatment of the diluted epimerizate with a decolorizing resin e. g. Duolite S 30 resin , a strongly acid cation exchange resin e. g., Permutit Q 4 resin , a weakly basic anion exchange resin e. g. Amberlite XE 275 resin , a second portion of strongly acid cation exchange resin e. g., Permutit Q 4 resin , a second portion of weakly basic anion exchange resin e. g. Amberlite XE 275 resin and activated carbon e. g., Darco S 51 in the order named. It is necessary to remove molybdenum since hydrogenation catalysts tend to be sensitive to the presence of molybdenum. The treated solution is essentially neutral, and may have a slightly lower solids content than the untreated solution say 50 vs. 55 solids. According to this invention, the purified glucosemannose epimerizate mixture is catalytically hydrogenated in an aqueous solution which is made alkaline by the presence of an alkali metal salt of a weak acid, yielding a reaction product mixture of sorbitol, mannitol, and minor amounts of impurities. The quantity of alkali metal salt in solution is sufficient so that the quantity of mannitol in the reaction product is greater than the quantity of mannitol which would be obtained under non isomerizing i. e. essentially neutral or mildly acidic hydrogenation conditions. The epimerizate solution is made alkaline by the presence of an alkaline metal salt. Sodium carbonate is the preferred alkali metal salt. Other water soluble alkali metal salts which give an alkaline reaction in aqueous media, such as disodium phosphate and sodium acetate, can also be used. Potassium salts and other alkali metal salts can also be used in place of the corresponding sodium salts, although the sodium salts are ordinarily preferred by reason of cost. The alkali metal salt may be added to the solution where necessary after purification and before hydrogenation in order to adjust the solution to the desired pH. The purified epimerizate is usually either non alkaline or insufficiently alkaline to cause any isomerization of glucose to take place simultaneously with hydrogenation . Sodium carbonate is ordinarily added in an amount of about 0. 2 to about 1. 5 by weight, based on the weight of sugar in the epimerizate. That is, for every one hundred pounds dry basis of sugar in the epimerizate solution, about 0. 2 pound to about 1. 5 pound of sodium carbonate is added. Preferred amounts of sodium carbonate are from about 0. 25 to about 0. 8 by weight, based on sugar. Equivalent quantities of other basically acting alkali metal salts may be added instead of sodium carbonate. In terms of pH, the amount of sodium carbonate or other alkali metal salt added is such as to produce a solution having a pH from about 8 to about 10, preferably from about 8 to 9. As the concentration of sodium carbonate or other alkaline reacting alkali metal salt is increased, the reaction rate increases but the precentage of impurities in the reaction product also increases. Good mannitol yields are obtainable at any alkaline metal salt concentration specified above. Sodium carbonate concentrations above 0. 8 percent by weight dry basis, based on sugar are not ordinarily preferred because of the relatively large amount of by products formed. A sodium carbonate concentration of about 0. 6 percent by weight based on sugar is preferred on an overall basis i. e. a combination of technical and economic considerations , since good product quality can be achieved at reasonable reaction times.From a purely technical standpoint, a lower sodium carbonate concentration, about 0. 3 percent by weight dry basis, based on sugar , is preferred, since impurities in the product are slightly less and the ion exchange load i. e., the ion exchange capacity required for deionization of the product is substantially lower. However, longer reaction times are required, and therefore operating costs are higher, at lower sodium carbonate concentrations. Sodium bicarbonate may be added in addition to sodium carbonate to the epimerized glucose solution if desired. The addition of both sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate increases the buffer capacity of the solution however, there does not appear to be any notable improvement either in increased mannitol yield or in reduced formation of by products, compared to the use of sodium carbonate alone. Additionally, the ion exchange capacity needed to purify the hydrogenated solution is increased. Other known buffers, such as a mixture of disodium phosphate and monosodium dihydrogen phsophate, can be added in place of sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate, in order to renderthe epimerizate solution alkaline. Solution concentrations of up to about 70 by weight of sugar solids may be used for hydrogenation. Solutions containing more than about 70 by weight of solids are too viscous for easy handling. Solution concentrations below about 50 by weight ordinarily are not preferred because the product solutions are too dilute for optimum crystallisation of mannitol from the mixed mannitol sorbitol product solution. Preferred solution concentrations are from about 50 to about 60 by weight of sugar solids. A solution concentration of about 55 by weight appears to be optimum for hydrogenation. Conventional supported nickel catalysts which are known in the art can be used for hydrogenation according to this invention. A preferred catalyst is nickel supported on diatomaX ceous earth, such as that described in U. S. Patent 3, 705, 199 cited supra. Other known sugar hydrogenation catalysts, containing either nickel or ruthenium as the active catalyst metal, can be used.Examples of such other catalysts include the supported nickel catalyst described in U. S. Patent 3,329,729 cited supra, and the supported ruthenium catalysts described in U. S. Patent 2, 868,847. Raney nickel can also be used as a catalyst, but the amounts of nickel required are larger, and the mannitol yields tend to be lower, than when a supported nickel catalyst is used under the same conditions of pressure, temperature, time and alkali concentration. Nickel catalysts are ordinarily preferred because of their lower cost and lower sensitivity to trace amounts of molybdenum, compared to ruthenium catalysts. The amount of catalyst is preferably from about 0. 6 to about 1. 0 pound of nickel per 100 pounds of sugar. Excellent results are obtained at a nickel sugar ratio of 0. 6 100, and this ratio is especially preferred. At least a portion of the hydrogenation according to this invention is ordinarily carried out at temperatures from about 50 to about 100 C., preferably at temperatures from about 60 to about 1000 C. Hydrogenation according to the present process is preferably carried out in two stages, the first at a relatively low temperature of about 50 to about 100 C., preferably about 60 to about 100 C. for a relatively long reaction time of about 1. 5 to about 2. 5 hours, and the second at a relatively high temperature for a relatively short reaction time, e. g., at about 110 to about 1600C. for about 0.2 to about 0. 5 hour. The reaction time required depends primarily on the reaction temperature particularly in the first stage and the alkali metal salt concentration. An increase in either alkali metal salt corn entration or in reaction temperature results in a reduction time required.No alkaline or acid material is ordinarily added during the course of reaction. The reaction medium, which is initially alkaline generally having a pH of about 8 to about 10 will ordinarily become less alkaline during the course of reaction and may in fact become slightly acid the final pH may be as low as about 6 . Reaction times at temperatures below 60 C. are ordinarily too long for practical use. First stage reaction temperatures above 100 C. result in undesirably large amounts of impurities in the product and are therefore avoid6d. The preferred first stage reaction temperature is ordinarily from about 80 to about 95 C. especially from about 80 C to about 85 C., this range provides a desirable balance between reaction time and product impurity formation. Most of the hydrogenation and an even greater percentage of isomerization takes place during the first stage. Hydrogenation is completed during the second stage.Temperatures and reaction times are chosen in accordance with the amount of unreduced sugar remaining at the end of the first stage. Preferred second stage hydrogenation temperatures are in the range of about 1200C. Temperatures over 1500C. are ordinarily used only when acid is added to the reaction mixture between the first and second hydrogenation stages as will subsequently be described. Hydrogenation may be carried out in a single stage at temperatures below 100 C. e. g., about 60 100 C when high loadings of alkali metals salt, sufficient to produce an initial pH of about 9 or higher, are used. However, hydrogenation of such solutions usually results in larger by product quantities than those obtained on hydrogenation of solutions having an initial pH in the range of 8 to about 9. The yield of mannitol increases in general with increasing amounts of their mannose or sodium carbonate or other alkaline reacting alkali metal salt in the feed. Increases in the amount of sodium carbonate also result in increased quantities of by products. The percentage of mannose in epimerized glucose feeds also affects to some extent the quality of by product obtained., as previously explained. Substantially enhanced mannitol yields compared to those obtainable under neutral or mildly acid hydrogenation conditions, are obtained with small quantities of impurities by using relatively low sodium carbonate concentrations. Pressures can vary over a wide range. Ordinarily, elevated pressures from about 250 psig. up to as high as 3, 000 psig. hydrogen pressure can be used, with little difference in mannitol yields or by product formation over this range. The process may be carried out in any suitable type of apparatus with which enables intimate contact of reactants and control of operating conditions. The hydrogenation apparatus must be pressure resistant. The process may be carried out in batch, semi continuous, or continuous operation. Continuous operation of the hydrogenation process is ordinarily preferred. It is desirable to treat the reaction product solution with anion and cation exchange resins in order to remove ions from the solution. A preferred deionization treatment uses a mixed bed containing about 60 percent by weight of a strongly basic anion resin and 40 percent by weight of a strongly acid cation exchange resin. The reaction product solution may also be treated with decolorizing materials, such as activated carbon, as required. The ion exchange capacity required i. e., ion exchange load is proportional to the total ion concentration in the product solution. Mannitol may be recovered from sorbitol mannitol mixtures in aqueous solution by means known in the art, for example, by fractional crystallisation as described in U. S.Patent, 3, 632, 656. A preferred mode of operation from a combination of technical and economic considerations is to hydrogenate a glucose mannose mixture or epimerizate in aqueous solution containing about 0. 6 percent by weight based on sugar of sodium carbonate at about 800 to about 85 C. for about 1. 5 to about 1.75 hours, and then at about 140 C. for about 0. 25 0. 5 hour total about 2 hours . From purely technical considerations a lower sodium carbonate concentration, e. g. about 0. 3 percent by weight, based on sugar, is preferred as previously indicated.The preferred reaction temperatures are the same in either case, i.e. , 80 85 C. followed by 140 C, Longer reaction times are required at the lower sodium carbonate concentration this results in greater operating costs. Various modifications can be made in the process of the present invention. According to one modification, an acid is added to the reaction mixture between the first and second hydrogenation stages, so that the second stage is conducted in a slightly acidic medium. Common mineral and organic acids of strong to moderate acid strength, such as sulfuric, hydrochloric.The second stage hydrogenation temperatures used in this mode of operation are in the range of about 1400to about 160 C. This mode of operation is especially useful when there is a higher than average disaccharide content in the sugar mixture which undergoes hydrogenation, since an acidic medium is useful in hydrolyzing disaccharides to monosaccharides. This mode of operation is most useful when the disaccharide content exceeds about 0. 5 by weight on the dry basis. When the disaccharide content is lower than about 0. 5 by weight, it is ordinarily preferable to carry out the second stage of hydrogenation without the addition of acid, as previously described, seince the use of acid increases the ion exchange load and requires slightly higher hydrogenation temperatures. Mixture of glucose, mannose and fructose can also be used as starting materials. Such mixtures can be obtained by epimerizing glucose to a mixture of glucose and mannose in aqueous solution as previously described, and treating the glucose mannose solution or epimerizate with glucose isomerase enzyme under conditions suitable for isomerization of part of the glucose to fructose. The resulting mixture of glucose, fructose, and mannose in aqueous solution can then be hydrogenated according to this invention as previously described, giving products containing up to about 50 percent mannitol dry basis . An advantage of this mode of operation is that enhanced yields of mannitol are obtained. Suitable conditions for isomerization of glucose using glucose isomerase enzyme are well known in the art. A preferred procedure is to pass a solution of glucose and mannose through a column of Arthrobacter cells which have been flocculated, dried, and pelleted as described inU. S. Patent 3,821,086, and then activated, as for example by soaking the dried pelleted cells in glucose mannose solution which may contain a low concentration e. g., about .004 M of magnesium ions. The sugar solution after epimerization and enzymatic isomerization typically contains about 25 32 mannose, approximately 25 30 fructose, balance principally glucose, all on the dry basis actual amounts may be greater or smaller. Mixtures of glucose and fructose in aqueous solution can also be hydrogenated according to this invention to produce a solution of sorbitol and mannitol. One such mixture is invert sugar, which consists essentially of approximately equimolar amounts of glucose and fructose with small amounts of unhydrolysed sucrose. Suitable invert sugars for hydrogenation according to this invention are those which contain no more than and preferably less than 2 of sucrose on the dry basis. The percentage of mannitol in hydrogenation products obtained from invert sugar is lower than the percentage of mannitol in the hydrogenation products prepared from the previously described solutions containing both glucose and mannose.Another glucose fructose mixture which may be hydrogenated according to this invention is a product obtained by isomerization of glucose in the presence of glucose isomerase enzyme. Suitable processes for enzymatic isomerization of glucose are well known in the art. The products usually contain about 40 45 percent by weight dry basis of fructose, balance mostly glucose. Such products are less desirable than invert sugar as starting materials for this invention, because the fructose content, and consequently the mannitol content obtained on hydrogenation. is lower. Reaction conditions used in hydrogenating glucose mannose and glucose mannosefructose mixtures previously described. Neither glucose nor mannose in pure form is a suitable starting material for hydrogenation according to the present process. When glucose is hydrogenated under the conditions described herein, the percentage of mannitol in the resulting hydrogenation product is too low to be of economic interest.Instead, glucose should be converted by epimerization, enzyme isomerization, or both, as indicated herein, to a sugar mixture which contains mannose, fructose, o both, in addition to glucose, and the resulting sugar mixture hydrogenated. Sugar mixtures containing a major amount i. e., more than about 50 by weight dry basis of mannose are not ordinarily suitable starting materials, because the amount of mannitol lost through isomerization of mannose in such mixtures in general exceeds the amount of mannitol gained through isomerization of glucose. Hydrogenation and isomerization of sugars present in the starting mixture take place simultaneously in the practice of the present invention. Glucose is isomerized in part to fructose, and the resulting fructose is hydrogenated to approximately equal amounts of sorbitol and mannitol while the unconverted glucose is hydrogenated almost entirely to sorbitol. Hydrogenation of sugar mixtures except those containing major amounts of mannose according to the present invention results in sorbitolmannitol mixtures containing appreciably larger amounts of mannitol than the amounts of mannitol which would be obtained by hydrogenation of the same sugar mixtures under non isomerizing i. e. , neutral or mildly acid conditions. A major advantage of the hydrogenation process of this invention is that quantities of impurities formed in the present hydrogenation process are quite low compared to the amounts of impurities formed either in prior art alkaline hydrogenation processes, such as those described in U. S. Patent 3, 329,729 and 3, 763, 246 cited supra, while at the same time there is a substantial increase in mannitol yield compared to that obtained under non isomerizing hydrogenation conditions. This invention will be described in greater detail with respect to the examples which follow. The hydrogenation catalyst is nickel on kieselguhr, containing about 20 by weightNi and prepared as described in U. S. Patent No. 3,705, 199, unless otherwise indicated. All percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated. EXAMPLE 1Epimerization Preparation of Starting Material An aqueous glucose solution, 68 percent by weight of glucose based on total solution weight, and 0. 25 percent by weight of molybdic acid based on glucose, and having a pH of about 4, is heated in an air atmosphere at atmospheric pressure to 95 C., and is maintained at this tenperature for 3 hours. A brown epimerized glucose product, or epimerizate is obtained. The epimerizate is diluted to about 60 percent solids and is purified by successive treatments with Duolite S 30 decolorizing resin, Permutit Q 41, cation exchange resin, Amberlite XE 275 anion exchange resin and Darco S 51 activated carbon, and then again with Permutit Q 4 and Amberlite XE 275 resins. The purified epimerizate contains about 55 percent by weight of sugar solids and contains about 31 percent mannose, 64 percent glucose. and 1. 3 percent disaccharides, all on the dry basis.Hydrogenation A portion of the purified glucose mannose solution 55 percent solids 31 percent mannose dry basis prepared as described above is charged to an autoclave. To this solution are added 0. 25 percent, based on sugar. of sodium carbonate dry basis and reduced supported nickel catalyst in an amount equivalent to 0. 6 percent by weight of Ni based on sugar.The pH of the resultant slurry feed pH is 8. 3. The autoclave contents are pressured with hydrogen at room temperature to a pressure of about 1500 psig., heated to 85 C. with a resultant pressure rise to approximately 1750 psig. maintained at 85 C. for 1. 75 hours the first stage , and then heated to 140 C. and maintained at this temperature for 0. 5 hours the second stage . The reaction product is then filtered to separate the catalyst and is cooled to room temperature. The pH of the cooled reaction product is 6. 4. Analysis of the reaction product by gas liquid chromatography GLC shows 40. 2 percent mannitol, 58. 0 percent sorbitol, 0. 7 percent non sugar impurities 0. 07 percent reducing sugar, and 0. 92 percent total sugar.The amount of organic acids e.g., gluconic acid and their salts in the reaction product are small, as indicated by a high total accountability. Total accountability refers to the percentage of organic material in the reaction product that is accounted for by analysis. Since organic acids and their salts are the principal organic materials in the product that are not determined by the analytical procedure used, high total accountability indicates that organic acids and their salts are present in only small amounts. This run is a good run from the standpoints of mannitol yield and product purity. EXAMPLE 2 Glucose is epimerized and the epimerizate purified as in Example 1. The hydrogenation procedure is the same as that in Example 1, except that the feed contains 0.3 percent of sodium c arbonate based on sugar, the feed pH is 8. 6, the hydrogenation temperatures are 85 C. in the first stage and 130 C. in the second stage, and the first and second stage hydrogenation times are 2. 0 hours and 0. 25 hour, respectively. A product containing 43. 0 percent mannitol on the dry basis is obtained. EXAMPLE 3 TO 5Epimerization Glucose in aqueous solution 70 percent solids containing 0. 33 percent molybdic acid is epimerized at 900C. for 3 hours. The epimerizates used in Examples 3 and 4 are purified as in Example 1, except that Duolite C 25 strongly acid cation exchange resin is substituted for Permutit Q 4 resin. The epimerizate used in Example 5 is purified in the same manner except that treatment with the second portions of cation and anion exchange resins is omitted. The purified epimerizates contain about 26 percent mannose and 0. 1 percent disaccharides on the dry basis.Hydrogenation Epimerizate prepared as described above 55 percent solids 26 percent mannose dry basis , sodium carbonate 0. 45 percent by weight, based on sugar , and supported nickel catalyst 0. 6 percent Ni, based on sugar are charged to an autoclave under nitrogen atmosphere. The reagent catalyst slurry is pressured with hydrogen as in Example 1, and is heated in two stages to the temperatures and for the times indicated in Table 1. The reaction product is filtered, cooled and analysed as in Example 1. Results are shown in Table 1 below.

Mannitol 34.6 36.9 37.7 Total Sugar 0. 5 0. 5 0. 5 These examples show that the percentage of mannitol in the reaction product increases as first stage reaction temperature is raised. However, the amounts of side products e. g. organic acids which are not accounted for by analysis are higher inExample 5 than in Examples 3 and 4. EXAMPLES 6 AND 7 Epimerization and purification are carried out as inExample 3. The epimerizate contains about 26 percent mannose, and 0. 1 disaccharide. Hydrogenation is carried out as in Example 1, except that sodium carbonate and catalyst quantities, reaction conditions, and product analysis are as shown in Table 2 below. The amount of sodium carbonate in each of these examples in 0. 60 percent by weight, based on sugar.

Mannitol 40. 4 38. 5 Total Sugar 0. 5 0. 5 Comparison of Examples 6 and 7 with Examples 3 5 suggests that the use of higher sodium carbonate concentrations leads to higher percentages of mannitol in the product. InExamples 3 7 the amount of mannitol produced and the total sugar left in the product are less than in Example 2. This is a result of the milder epimerization conditions producing less mannose and less disaccharides. EXAMPLES 8 AND 9 Epimerisation and purification are carried out as inExample 1, yielding epimerized glucose containing 31 percent mannose on the dry basis. Epimerized glucose 55 percent solids 31 percent mannose dry basis prepared as described above, nickel catalyst equivalent to 0. 6 percent Ni based on sugar. and sodium carbonate, and sodium bicarbonate in the amounts indicated in Table 3 below, are charged to an autoclave under nitrogen atmosphere. Reaction temperatures and times are as shown in Table 3, and acetic acid is added between the first and second hydrogenation stages in Examples 9 and 11 otherwise hydrogenation procedures are similar to those of Example 1. The reaction products in Examples 9 and 11 are treated in a mixed bed of ion exchange resins 40 percent by weight of Permutit Q strongly acid cation exchange resin and 60 percent by weight of Permutit S 2 strongly basic anion exchange resin prior to analysis. Amounts of mannitol in the product are given in Table 3.

Example 8 yields a product having a good mannitol percentage, and high purity except for sugar , with an ion exchange load about half that of Example 10.A high reducing sugar value 0. 34 percent in Example 8 shows incomplete reduction, which can be remedied by a higher second stage hydrogenation temperature in the presence of acetic acid as in Example 9. Example 11 also illustrates a two stage hydrogenation process in which the first stage is carried out under alkaline conditions and the second stage under acid conditions using added acid. A higher second stage temperature is permissible because of the acidic medium. The addition of acid prior to second stage hydrogenation is not ordinarily preferred except when the epimerized glucose feed contains a significant quantity about 0. 5 percent or more of disaccharides or when a reduced residence time in the second stage is desireable. EXAMPLE 12 Glucose in aqueous solution is epimerized as inExample 1 and is treated with Duolite S 30 decolourizing resin, a cation exchange resin Amberlite XE 275 , and with Darco S 51 decolourizing carbon, giving a purified glucose epimerizate containing 28 percent by weight mannose. A feed slurry comprising epimerized glucose 55 percent solids 28 percent mannose dry basis , nickel catalyst 0. 6 percent Ni based on sugar . and 0. 6 percent by weight of added sodium carbonate. based on sugar. and having an initial pH of 9. 0, is passed continously through a four reactor system in which the reactors are arranged in series. The temperature in the first three reactors is 90 C. and the temperature in the final reactor is 140 C. The flow rate is such as to give a total residence time of 2. 5 hours 2. 0 hours at gOOC. and 0. 5 hour at 140 C . A product containing 39. 3 percent mannitol, 0. 09 percent reducing sugar and 0. 48 percent total sugar, all on the dry basis. is obtained. EXAMPLE 13 Glucose in aqueous solution is epimerized and purified to give 28 percent mannose on the dry basis. The above epimerized glucose solution, containing 0.004 M magnesium ion as magnesium chloride and adjusted to a pH of 8. 2 8. 5, is passed downwardly through a column of dried pelleted Arthrobacter cells containing glucose isomerase at 60 C. The cells are prepared as described in U. S. Patent 3,821,086 and are activated by swelling in a solution containing 0. 1 M in MgC13 and 0.01 M MgCl2 and washed in 0. 004 M MgC12 prior to use. The column effluent contains about 27 percent mannose, 25 percent fructose, and 46 percent glucose, all on the dry basis.The effluent is purified by treatment with anion and cation exchange resins i. e., Permutit Q 4 and Amberlite IRA 68 resins . A feed containing a solution of glucose, fructose, and mannose prepared as described above 55 percent solids , nickel catalyst equivalent to 0. 6 percent Ni based on sugar, and 0. 3 percent by weight of added sodium carbonate, and having a pH of 8.7 is hydrogenated at 850C. for 2.0 hours, then 130 C. for 0.25 hour. The product contains 47. 1 percent mannitol and 50. 1 percent sorbitol, both on the dry basis. EXAMPLE 14 Invert sugar, containing about 48 percent by weight of glucose, 47 percent by weight of fructose, 0. 3 percent by weight of sucrose, and 0.4 percent by weight of other disaccharides, all on the dry basis, and prepared by inversion of sucrose in aqueous solution at 55 C. and pH 1. 1 for 2 hours, is hydrogenated as follows A 55 percent by weight aqueous invert sugar solution 0. 3 percent by weight, based on sugar, of sodium carbonate and supported nickel catalyst 0. 6 percent by weightNi, based on sugar , are charged to an autoclave under nitrogen atmosphere. The pH of the resultant slurry is 8. 9. The autoclave contents are pressured to about 1500 psig. with hydrogen at room temperature, are heated to 85 C., maintained at 85 C. for 2. 0 hours, heated to 1300C. , and maintained at 130 C. for 0. 5 hour. The reaction product is filtered to separate the catalyst and is cooled to room temperature. The product pH is 6. 7. Analysis of the product shows 34. 9 percent mannitol and 1. 1 percent total sugar, including 0. 13 percent reducing sugar, all by weight on the dry basis. Another portion of the Above invert sugar solution 55 solids is catalytically hydrogenated for 2 hours at 1600 C. under essentially neutral conditions i. e., no added sodium carbonate , yielding a product containing 30. 0 percent mannitol, and 0. 6 percent total sugar including 0. 14 percent reducing sugar, all by weight on the dry basis. Procedures and reaction conditions are similar to those in Example 14 except as noted. The mannitol yield obtained in Example 14 is appreciably better than the mannitol yield obtained from a similar invert sugar sample under non isomerizing conditions, as the above data show. Sugar values were slightly high in both cases probably due to the presence of sucrose and other disaccharides in the invert sugar feed. EXAMPLE 15 Glucose is epimerized by heating an aqueous solution containing about 60 percent glucose and 0.25 percent, based on the dry weight of glucose, of molybdic acid to 9500. maintaining the solution at this temperature for 3 hours, and cooling the solution. The resulting dark brown epimerized glucose solution, or epimerizate, is treated with a cation exchange resin Permutit Q and a weakly basic anion exchange resin AmberliteXE 275 , Rohm Haas Co., Philadelphia, Pa. and with 2 , based on sugar. of Darco 5 51 ICI Americas Inc. , Wilmington, Dex. decolourizing carbon, giving adecolourizing and essentially molybdenum free less than 1 ppm Mo aqueous solution of glucose and mannose, containing about 30 by weight of mannose and about 70 by weight of glucose on the dry basis. The purified epimerized glucose solution 200 ml. 120g. or 60 by weight sugar solids 30 mannose and 70 glucose dry basis , 1. 5 g. of sodium carbonate 1. 25 by weight, based on sugar . and 5 g. of nickel on kieselguhr catalyst 1 g., or 0. 8 based on sugar. of Ni are charged to an autoclave under a nitrogen atmosphere. The pH of this mixture is 9. 6.The autoclave is pressured with hydrogen to 1500 psig., heated to 800 C. . and maintained at this temperature for 2 hours. The reaction product slurry is cooled to room temperature and filtered the filtrate pH is 9. 2. The filtrate is treated with a mixed bed ion exchange resin i. e., a bed containing an anion exchange resin and a cation exchange resin and with Darco S Si decolourizing carbon giving a clear solution containing about 42. 7 mannitol on the dry basis. However, the amounts of impurities are significantly higher than the amount obtained when using smaller amounts of sodium carbonate in two stage operation as previously described. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE In a comparative run, carried out inder the same conditions as Example 2 except that 0. 3 percent by weight of sodium hydroxide based on sugar is used in place of sodium carbonate, giving a feed pH of 9. 6. A mannitol yield of 42. 9 percent is obtained, and reducing sugar 0. 13 percent is acceptable. However, isomers 1. 9 percent , and impurities not accounted for by analysis are greater than in Example 2. This indicates that sodium hydroxide is a less desirable alkaline material than sodium carbonate when operating at low alkaline material levels.
