# Improved double layer capacitors

## Abstract
A double layer capacitor comprises a first and second electrode which electrodes comprise a high surface area constituent, and an electrolyte, and an ionically conductive separator means between and in contact with said electrodes electronically separating said electrodes from each other, the electrolyte having a pH above about 2 so that the capacitor exhibits low leakage current. A capacitor comprises 2 electrode assemblies 12 , 14 13 separated by separator means 15 the high surface area carbon electrodes 13 being impregnated with electrolyte.
