## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a mixture of dialkyl ethers of polyalkylene glycols useful in removing acidic gas components such as hydrogen sulfide from gas mixtures. Still more particularly the present invention relates to a mixture of dimethyl ethers of polyethylene glycol, having an average molecular weight of from about 200 to 255, and preferably from 227 to 244, which is effective at low temperatures for the removal of acidic gas components from gas mixtures. U.S. Patent 3,737,392 teaches that a certain mixture of dimethyl ethers of polyethylene glycols is useful in treating and separating acid gas particularly hydrogen sulfide from gas mixtures such as natural gas mixtures containing hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide and methane. Such a solvent system available under the trademark SELEXOL has been widely and successfully used in many natural gas treating operations. However, it has been found that such a solvent system does not operate efficiently at subfreezing temperatures. Thus, for example, at about 100F. to about 100F. the solvent rapidly becomes rather viscous. The increased viscosity tends to reduce the rate of solvent flow through a gas absorber so that less and less gas can be treated.Further at this low temperature the solvent starts to freeze, fouling heat exchangers. Then mass transfer problems begin to appear further reducing the efficiency of the gas treating operation. The solvent according to the present invention markedly alleviates and in some instances completely eliminates these problems.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The improved solvent composition according to the present invention comprises a mixture of dimethyl ethers of polyethylene glycols of the formula CH3O C2H4O x CH3 CI wherein x is from about 3 to about 8.The homolog distribution I is approximately as follows Homolog distribution, CH30 CC2H4O x CH3 x Molecular homolog wt. 2 . about 0.1 1 3 .............................. about 8 50 4 .............................. about 28 40 5 .............................. about 7 33 6 .............................. about 2 24 7 .............................. about 0 5 8 .............................. about 0 2 A preferred homolog distribution is approximately as follows CH30 C2H4O x CH3 x Molecular homolog wt. 2 .............................. about 0.1 0.5 3 .............................. about 12 22 4 .............................. about 30 36 5 .............................. about 28 33 6 .............................. about 8 12 7 .............................. about 2 7 8 .............................. about 0.1 1.0 The above solvent composition II has a vapor pressure of about 0.0003 mm of Hg and a viscosity of about 11 centipoises at a temperature of about 150F. 9.4 C. and a vapor pressure of about 0.0001 mm of Hg and a viscosity of about 18 centipoises at a temperature of about OOF. 180c. The solvent composition may be used in known processes for separating hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide and mercaptans from gases, and it is particularly suitable in a subfreezing environment. As an example, the instant solvent composition may be used in place of the solventSELEXOL disclosed and described in the aforementioned U.S.Patent 3,737,392. The disclosure in the 3,737,392 patent for treating gases is accordingly incorporated herein by reference. Another example would be the process disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,362,133.DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The mixture of dimethyl ethers of polyethylene glycols of the present invention is prepared from the corresponding monomethyl ethers of polyethylene glycols by reacting the monomethyl ether, with sodium to form the sodium alcoholate thereof, reacting the sodium alcoholate with methyl chloride to form the dimethyl ethers and sodium chloride, and separating the sodium chloride from the dimethyl ethers. Preferably, about 0.1 0.6 weight percent of water is incorporated in the monomethyl ethers, and the reaction temperature is maintained at about 100 1200C. The mixture of monomethyl ethers of polyethylene glycols from which the diethers are derived may be prepared from ethylene oxide and methanol. About 4.5 mols of ethylene oxide is reacted with 1 mol of methanol at about ll0 1400C. using sodium hydroxide as catalyst. The resulting product is distilled at about 10 mm. Hg pressure to remove all of the low boiling compounds, together with most of the monomethyl ether of triethylene glycol.

The invention will be described further in conjunction with the following examples which are not intended to be limitative in nature. EXAMPLE I Preparation of a mixture of monomethyl ethers of polyethylene glycols A carbon steel reactor equipped with a central agitator and means for heating and cooling was charged with 7 lbs. of 50 weight percent aqueous sodium hydroxide and 865 pounds of methanol. The mixture was heated to 1100c., and 4757 pounds of ethylene oxide was added to the mixture over a period of several hours. Reaction temperature was maintained at ll0 1400c. by cooling. The pressure remained below 150 p.s.i.a. The resulting mixture was then cooled to 60 C. and stored. This crude product had an average molecular weight of 204 and contained monomethyl ether of mono through octaethylene glycols. The crude product was batch distilled in a 4 plate column operating at a pressure of 10 mm, Hg and a reflux ratio of 1. Lights were removed until the overhead temperature of the column reached about 1550C. The column bottoms were taken as product and had the following composition Monomethyl ether of Weight percent Triethylene glycol ................................. 17 Tetraethylene glycol .......................... 33 Pentaethylene.........................................33 Hexaethylene glycol ................................ 11 Heptaethylene glycol ........................... 5 Octaethylene glycol ................................ 1 Average molecular weight of this mixture of monomethyl ethers of polyethylene glycols was about 224. EXAMPLE .11 Preparation of a mixture of dimethyl ethers of polyethylene glycols A stainless steel reactor equipped with means for agitating, heating, and cooling was charged with 1080 lbs. of monomethyl ethers of polyethylene glycols prepared in Example I and having an average molecular weight of about 224. About 4.6 lbs. of water was added and the mixture was agitated and heated to 1100C. About 112 pounds of molten sodium at 135 1400C., was added to the mixture over a period of several hours while the mixture was maintained at about 120 130 C., by cooling. Hydrogen formed during the reaction was vented. The reaction yielded the sodium alcoholate of the monomethyl ethers of polyethylene glycol. Next 305 pounds of methyl chloride was added to the reaction mixture over a period of several hours while the reaction mixture was maintained at about 115 1250c. by cooling. The resulting reaction yielded sodium chloride and the dimethyl ethers of polyethylene glycols. The sodium chloride was separated from the reaction mixture in a centrifuge, and the resulting liquid product was stripped with natural gas to remove any excess methyl chloride.The stripped product was filtered, allowed to stand 24 hours and refiltered to remove any residual sodium chloride.This product may be distilled, if desired, but distillation is not necessary.
