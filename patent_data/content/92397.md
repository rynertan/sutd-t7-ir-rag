## Description
Nickel chromium molybdenum alloy The present invention relates to nickelchromium molybdenum alloys of high yield strength and resistance to corrosion in environments such as are found in sour gas wells. A number of forms of corrosion come into play in sour gas well production. Typically sour gas wells contain hydrogen sulphide, carbon dioxide, methane and brine, often at operating temperatures of 250 to 3000C. Thus the most important forms of corrosion and failure of well tubing are hydrogen sulphide stress cracking HSSC resulting from H2S evolution, chloride stress corrosion cracking CSCC , pitting and general corrosion. Well aging may also be a cause of early failure. Hydrogen sulphide stress cracking appears to result from the presence of both H2S and brine causing hydrogen evolution. This permeates the tubing causing hydrogen embrittlement which with tensile stress leads to cracking. The susceptibility of low alloy steels prevents their prolonged use in sour gas wells.Chloride stress corrosion cracking, from release of chloride ions is particularly troublesome at higher operating temperatures, and the susceptibility of stainless steels to this form of corrosion prevents their use in sour gas wells. Pitting corrosion is also caused by chloride attack, and is a particular problem for thin wall tubing.General corrosion causes weight loss of metal affecting the ability of the material to sustain load and its pressure bearing capabilities. Well aging is the time dependent degradation in properties during prolonged exposure at elevated temperatures, of 2500 or even 3000C found in some wells. This affects the ability of the alloy to resist growth propagation. An alloy for use in sour gas wells, particularly those greater than 15,000 feet deep must offer both resistance to the hostile corrosive environment and high yield strength, to allow the use of thin wall tubing allowing high volume gas flow but resisting tensile failure under high axial loading.The alloys must be cold workable to generate the strength required necessitating a high level of work hardening.Also required is an acceptable level of residual ductility , the ductility remaining after cold working, since considerable distortion is likely to be encountered in sour gas well tubing in service. The alloy also needs hot workability and the ability to be fabricated. The present invention is based on the discovery that certain Ni Cr Mo alloys can be produced satisfying these requirements even at applied stresses in excess of 1000 MN m2. According to the present invention is provided a wrought alloy having a yield strength in excess of 1000 MN m2 and resistance to corrosive environments such as those found in a sour gas well having the composition by weight 15 to 30 chromium, 5 to 15 molybdenum the total content of chromium and molybdenum being in the range 29 to 40 , 5 to 15 iron the total content of iron, chromium and molybdenum being not in excess of 46 , carbon up to 0.06 , up to 1 aluminium and or titanium, up to 1 silicon, up to 0.5 niobium, less than 0.3 manganese balance nickel apart from incidental elements and impurities. Such alloys exhibit Ã  high degree of resistance to hydrogen sulphide stress cracking, chloride stress corrosion cracking, pitting and general corrosion, and have good ductility and resistance to well aging . It is particularly important that phosphorous and sulphur levels be kept as low as possible. Whilst manganese may be present up to 0.3 , it is preferably kept below 0.2 . Incidental elements may include copper which is not required and may be kept to low levels, and cobalt up to about 25 . Boron up to 0.1 and mischmetal up to 0.1 may provide useful refining additions. Carbon, while virtually unavoidably present, affects ductility. Magnesium and zirconium can be used for grain refinement. Tungsten does not offer any particular advantage, given its density and added cost.The carbon content is preferably held to not more than 0.03 , and amounts up to about 0.1 of magnesium and or zirconium may be present. It is important that alloys of the invention have correct compositional balance since otherwise premature failure may result. Preferably the chromium level does not fall below 20 to provide sufficient pitting resistance and HSSC and CSCC resistance. The chromium need not exceed 30 . When chromium levels of below 15 are used it is necessary to provide high levels of molybdenum and this can affect working characteristics. Molybdenum markedly contributes to corrosion resistance but imparts a large degree of work hardening.Levels as low as 5 may be used in comparatively less severe conditions of temperature and pressure but levels of 7 or more are preferred. The content of chromium plus molybdenum should preferably be above 32 but preferably does not exceed 40 . This is because alloy brittleness, and other hot working problems can be caused at such levels. Also above 15 of molybdenum, the ductility of the alloy may be affected. The preferred content of molybdenum is 7 to 12 . The content of chromium and molybdenum also affects residual ductility.It has found to be desirable that the quantity Cr 2 Mo is from 2 to 12 provides for optimum residual ductility. Iron is present in alloys of the present invention at levels of from 5 to 15 , more preferably 8 to 12 .Excessive iron may produce unwanted morphological phases, such as sigma, and to prevent this the sum of molybdenum, chromium and iron is preferablytbelow 46 . Aluminium and titanium may be used as refining additions, and they contribute to workability. Preferably alloys for use in the present invention contain 0.05 to 0.5 of either or both of these elements. The presence of silicon may not be deleterious, but it is preferably kept below 0.5 to avoid affecting the hydrogen stress cracking resistance. Thus the preferred wrought alloy of the present invention having a yield strength in excess of 1000 MN m2 and intended for use in corrosive environments such as sour gas wells, consists of, by weight, 20 to 30 chromium,7 to 12 molybdenum, the sum of chromium plus molybdenum being in the range 29 to 40 , the quantity of chromium less twice the molybdenum being in the range 2 to 12 , from 5 to 15 iron, the sum of chromium, molybdenum and iron not exceeding 46 , from 0.05 to 0.5 of either or both of aluminium and titanium, up to 0.06 carbon, up to 0.5 niobium, up to 0.5 silicon, up to 0.2 manganese the balance apart from impurities being nickel. Alloys for use in the present invention, including the preferred alloys, are solution annealed at temperatures in the range 1066 to 11770C, preferably 1093 to 11770C for 0.5 to 5 hours, normally 1 to 2 hours. The alloys are cooled, for example by air cooling and are cold worked in the range 40 to 50 or more to provide yield strengths of the order of 1200MN m2 or more. Since only low levels of aluminium and titanium are present the alloys are not age hardenable, so that aging treatments are not required. Some examples will now be described. Example 1 A range of alloys both inside and outside the invention were produced in approximately 45 kg heats by induction melting high purity charge materials, hot rolling the ingots to plate stock approximately 15 mm thick, and solution annealing followed by cold rolling to develop strength. The amount of cold rolling was varied. Test specimens were machined from the cold rolled material normally in the transverse direction. Tables I sets out the chemical composition of the alloys and includes alloys in which major element concentrations were varied, and alloys based nominally on NiL25 Cr 10 Mo in which minor element concentrations were varied.

Standard TM 01 77 in a solution of 5g glacial acetic acid and 50g NaCl in 945g H20 saturated with H2S gas. This allows sensitivity to H2 S gas at ambient temperatures to be tested. THe specimens were 3 point bent beam samples loaded in small electrically insulated test fixtures stressed to various percentage of the yield strength, usually 100 . The cold rolled materials were given well aging heat treatments at 2600 3150C for various times before testing. The samples were oriented in the transverse direction from the cold worked plate. Note extra specimens were first deformed to determine the load deflection characteristics. Specimens for test were then loaded in the fixtures to predetermined deflection corresponding to desired stress levels. SomeU bend specimen were also tested. All samples were attached to small pieces of steel to provide galvanic coupling. Yield strength 0.2 offset , applied stress level and HSSC results are given in Table II. As noted duplicate samples were tested, the test period covering five 5 weeks. Additional results are reported in Table III involving U bend tests in the NACE H2 S solution, the test period being varied as indicated.

Good correlation between pitting behaviour in ferric chloride and behaviour in sour gas well environments has been observed in the literature . Electrochemical tests were conducted at 600C in 10,000 ppm NaCl solution adjusted to pH 2 with hydrochloric acid. Scans were run at 60 v hr to characterize the pitting resistance. The current density during the forward scan at 0.6 v vs. standard calomel electrode was used as a measure of the pitting behaviour as described by P.E. Morris and R.C. Scarberry, Corrosion,Vol. 28, 1972, p. 444. Data is reported in Table V. The results obtained are given in Table V.

Alloy D is such an alloy. Alloy 1 is a marginal composition.Moreover, it does not satisfy the relationship Cr 2 Mo is in the range 2 to 12. Given the numerous alloys within the invention and which are characterised by a highly satisfactory combination of properties, including residual ductility, Alloy 1 would not be recommended for sour gas well applications. Alloys 11, 12 and 13 were excellent. From the foregoing examples 1 to 5 it will be observed that alloys for use in the present invention gave quite good results. This is not true of the comparative alloys. It will be observed that no tests were carried out on alloys M,N, 0 and P which all cracked during hot working. This is a result of their high molybdenum or molybdenum plus chromium levels. Results on comparative commercial alloys from the literature suggest that alloy C273, MP 35 N and alloy 625 all crack in NACE H2S U bend tests within a week or two.Some of the alloys of the invention subjected to these tests survived at stress levels of over 1200 MN m2, and did well at temperatures of 2880C. Commercial alloys fail rapidly under such conditions. Example 6 In order to ascertain what problems might evolve if commercial size ingots were made, four simulated heavy section castings were prepared. These were produced as 136 kg heats that were cast into 20.3 cm x 20.3 cm x 35.6 cm sand moulds with exothermic hot tops. The castings approximate the solidification that would take place in ingots of the order of 0.09 m2 in cross sectional area. The nominal chemistries of the ingots are given in Table VIII TABLE VIII Alloy Cr Mo Fe Ni 24 25 10 10 bal. X 28 10 10 bal. Y 25 13 10 bal. Z 25 10 15 bal. Metallographic examination of cross sections from the ingots showed only traces of amounts of second phase particles in Alloy 24, but significant amounts of second phases in the other alloys. Slices from all four castings were successfully hot rolled at 11490C from 2.54 cm to 1.27 cm thickness with no signs of cracking. No second phase particles were seen in the hot rolledAlloy 24, but significant amounts were still present in X, Y and Z. The chemistries of the latter alloys were too rich in Cr Mo Fe. This total sum should be maintained at a level not greater than about 46. As well as being useful in deep sour gas wells, the alloys described hereinbefore can be used in other corrosive environments in which high strength is required. Such applications include, intermediate gas wells, aqueous and marine environments, scrubbers, chemical plant equipment such as tubing and piping , aircraft and aerospace and applications. Mill product forms include forgings, bar plate, extrusions and sheet.Among other structural shapes might be mentioned fasteners, valves, pins, shafts and rotors.
