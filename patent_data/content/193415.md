# Spiro 3 heteroazolidine compounds and salts thereof, their preparation and pharmaceutical agents thereof.

## Abstract
A spiro 3 heteroazolidine is of the formula Compounds I where T is NH and U is O are made by reacting a precursor having an O atom in place of the HN CO NH CO group with a metallic cyanide and ammonium carbonate in a solvent at 50 150 C the precursor can be made from a chromanone. Various V and W moieties are introduced by modifying a COOH group at the VW position. A precursor III having CONHâ‚‚ and a halogen atom in place of the HN CO NH CO is a reacted with thiourea in the presence of a base in a solvent at 60 150 C to make a compound I where T is S and U is NH, b hydrolyed with an acid in a refluxing solvent to give a compound where T is S and U is O, or c reacted with KSCN in a solvent at 60 150 C to give a compound T is NH and U is S. The compounds I and their alkali salts are useful in pharmaceutical compositions, e.g. tablets, for oral dosage, to prevent complications caused by diabetes.
