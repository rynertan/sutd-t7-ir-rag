# Drip feed device.

## Abstract
A drip feed device connectable to a source of medical fluid, such as a fluid filled hypodermic syringe, comprises a drip chamber and an adapter having a first passageway which allows fluid communication between the syringe and the drip chamber and a second passageway which provides an air vent from outside the drip chamber to the syringe. The second passageway may comprise a cannula which extends into the fluid upon attachment of the drip chamber with the syringe. A ball valve may be disposed in the second passageway to allow air to flow into the syringe to replace the dispensed fluid but to prevent fluid flow from the syringe through the second passageway.
