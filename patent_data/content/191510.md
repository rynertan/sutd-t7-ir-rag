# Self diagnostic ultrasonic intrusion detection system.

## Abstract
The disclosed self diagnostic ultrasonic motion detection system includes an ultrasonic transceiver operative in a transmit mode and in a receive mode. In normal operation, the ultrasonic transceiver in its transmit mode has a characteristic electrical impedance. Potential electro mechanical, electrical, acoustical, and other sources of false and failure of alarm situations manifest as changes in the electrical impedance of the transceiver in its transmit mode. The electrical impedance is monitored, changes from the nominal are detected, and a suitable self diagnostic alarm signal is produced in response thereto.
