# Adhesive compositions.

## Abstract
Moisture curable adhesive compositions are described which comprise a minor amount of a tackifying resin, and a moisture curable polyurethane prepolymer having NCO groups available for reaction, and a monofunctional reactant present in amounts sufficient to react with up to 40 mole of the isocyanate groups of the prepolymer. Preferred polyurethanes are based on polyesters from aliphatic dicar boxylic acids and diols together with aromatic diisocyanates for example MDI. The monofunctional reactant influences the extended ability of a chain extended layer of the adhesive to be activated by heat after comparatively long periods in com bination with the achievement of good bond strengths. Pre ferred compositions are suitable for adhesive bonding of soles to shoes.
