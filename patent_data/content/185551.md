# MULLITE SILICA CONTACT MATERIAL, ITS PRODUCTION, AND ITS USE IN SELECTIVE VAPORIZATION OF PETROLEUM FEEDSTOCK

## Abstract
Improved noncatalytic nonreactive alumina silica solid for removing carbonaceous and metallic contaminants in cluding nickel and vanadium from hydrocarbon feedstock by short term, high temperature contact comprises mullite and crystalline silica. In the decarbonizing and demetallizing process, impurities are deposited on the particles of the solid and the major portion of the feedstock is vaporized. After burning carbonaceous deposit from the particles, the hot particles containing nickel and vanadium are recycled into contact with incoming charges of contaminated feedstock. Periodically metals are removed from coke depleted parti cles by extraction with a mineral acid at elevated tempera ture without dissolving or otherwise destroying the alumina silica particles. The particles are then reintroduced into the system The particles comprising mullite and crystalline silica are obtained by calcining particles of high purity kaolin or kyanite under controlled conditions to assure substantial conversion of silica content of the clay or kyanite to a mixture of mullite and crystalline silica. Optionally, small amounts of acid insoluble alumina are also present in the particles.
