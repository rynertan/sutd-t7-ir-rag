# Textile fabric utilizing cored yarns.

## Abstract
A textile fabric woven or knitted by the use of cored yarns, each of which cored yarns comprises a thread wadding, composed by a bundle of inner fibers having a high water retentivity, and a thread sheath composed of a plurality of outer fibers arranged exteriorly of the thread wadding so as to substantially completely enclose the inner fibers. The outer fibers has a high moisture permeability and a low water retentivity, and the inner fibers are substantially completely encompassed by the outer fibers in a predeter mined thickness while permitted to expand upon absorption of water or moisture vapor.
