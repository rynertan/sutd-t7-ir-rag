# GAAS INTEGRATED CIRCUIT DEVICE AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING IT

## Abstract
An integrated circuit including a field effect transistor Q‚ÇÅ formed on a GaAs semiconductor crystal substrate 10 is produced by implanting ions of an n type impurity into the substrate 10 and heat treating it at a high temperature to activate the implanted layer into an active layer 13, 14, 15 . The substrate 10 is initially formed with a neutral impurity such as In and thus the substrate initially substantially only contains electrically neutral impurities. The field effect transistor thus produced has a precisely defined threshold voltage and all the transistors produced in the same device have a threshold voltage within a narrow predetermined range. This provides much improved performance, particu larly when a differential amplifier is formed by a pair of field effect transistors in the integrated circuit.
