# DISPOSABLE CUP WITH SIDEWALL POP OUT

## Abstract
A paper cup or similar disposable thin walled fluid container with a removable or pop out portion in its sidewall containing redemption information is disclosed wherein the pop out portion is formed by a series of surrounding perforations in the sidewall, which perforations are sealed against fluid leakage by being filled with the protective material, such as wax, that is used to coat the sidewall to protect it against the fluid in the container. The perforations may outline an integral portion of the sidewall or when the redemption indicia is to be obscured, separate portions at the opposite edges of the sidewall blank may be outlined, which portions will cooperate to form the pop out portion as part of the sidewall seam when the edges are overlapped and joined.
