# Phosphorylation process.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of an aromatic phosphon ous dihalide which comprises reacting an aromatic com pound with a phosphorus trihalide in the presence of a superacid, said superacid being an acid having an Hammett acidity function, Ho, which is more negative than 12. The aromatic phosphonous dihalides are useful as precursors for the preparation of phosphonites and phosphinites useful as catalysts for the dimerisation of acrylonitrile.
