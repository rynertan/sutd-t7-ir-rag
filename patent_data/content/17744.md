# Reactor vessel in service inspection assembly and ultrasonic centering device.

## Abstract
A reactor vessel in service inspection assembly 17 having an improved positioning device 80 for properly and repeatedly locating the inspection transducers 75 of the assembly within a hollow portion of the reactor vessel cavity. The assembly includes an acoustic transducer 80 affixed to the positioning arm 40 of the inspection trans ducers 75 . The positioning transducer 80 is operable to generate and simultaneously, radially direct acoustic signals around the circumference of the hollow portion of the vessel cavity and receive the signals reflected off of the cavity walls at a location within the hollow cavity. Means are provided for monitoring the received signals as a func tion of time. Means are provides for automatically moving the positioning arm 40 in response to the monitored difference in the time of reception of the received signals so as to locate the positioning transducer at a preestab lished location within the hollow portion of the reactor cavity.
