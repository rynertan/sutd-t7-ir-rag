# GEAR

## Abstract
A gear comprises two co operating gear wheels 1, 2 , one 2 of which, in operation, performing a conical pendulating movement nutation . One gear wheel 2 is non rotationally connected to an adjacent element 8 by resilient elongated members 9 , preferably extending mainly in the circumferential direction of the gear wheel between two supports 10, 11 arranged diametrically on the gear wheel and two supports 12, 13 arranged di ametrically on the adjacent element and offset about 90 in relation to the first mentioned supports. The resilient members keep the gear wheel 2 non rotationally in the adjacent element and permits said pendulating move ment of the gear wheel.
