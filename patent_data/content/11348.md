# A packing container and a laminate for its manufacture.

## Abstract
Packing containers of the non returnable type are man ufactured from weblike packing material which by folding and sealing is converted to parallelepipedic packing contain ers. For reasons of geometry triangular corner lugs 5 are formed in the preocess which are folded in and sealed to the bottom wall of the packing container. The folding takes place along the edges of the bottom wall which adjoin the corner lugs 5 but, since the corner lugs 5 consist of several layers of material, they are difficult to fold in a sharp and well defined manner, which has a negative effect on the flatness of the bottom wall. To facilitate the folding the corner lugs 5 are delimited from the adjoining bottom wall by means of a crease line 10 weakening the material which extends at an angle over the bottom wall of the packing container. As a result the material will be folded on the one hand along the crease line, on the other hand along the actual straight bottom wall edge which appreciably improves the flatness of the packing container bottom.
