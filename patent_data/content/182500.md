## Description
CAROUSEL ROD LOADER TECHNICAL FIELD The instant invention relates to drilling in general and more particularly a carousel rod loader especially adapted for use with a drilling apparatus. BACKGROUND ART A highly efficient and safer method of bulk mining entitledVertical Retreat Mining VRM has been recently developed to more expeditiously mine ore from underground mines. In brief, in order to continue to work an underground excavation, large diameter blast holes are drilled into the floor of an upper stope or drift vertically disposed above a lower stope. The stopes may be separated by up to 750 feet 228.6 meters . These blast holes of various depths are drilled in predetermined patterns and filled with the appropriate explosive in order to loosen the ore and rock disposed between the two levels for subsequent removal and treatment. See Canadian Patent application 444,715 for a detailed description of a drilling apparatus designed for VRM. Currently, standard drill rods weigh about 80 libs. 36.2 kg and are about 5 feet 1.5 m long. As can be imagined, it is a laborious job to stop a drill every five feet, unloosen the various fittings, install a new rod, connect the rod to the previously installed rods comprising the drill string and the rotary drive, and then start up the drill again. Moreover provision must be made to store drill rods. Clearly it is advantageous to employ a system that will automatically store and connect drill rods together without the need for constant surveillance. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, there is provided an automatic carousel rod loader that transports and stores drill rods and, more importantly, sttschs a new drill rod to a pre existing drill string associated with a drilling rig. The loader includes a carousel magazine for storing rods and a series of associated fluid driven mechanical grabbing means for grasping, transporting and positioning the drill rod for attachment to the drill string and drill drive. Moreover, the loader is designed to exactly track the drill angle of the drill so as not to interfere with angled drilling. The loader also disconnects the rod and returns it to the magazine. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a front elevation of the invention. Figure 2 is a side elevation of the invention. Figure 3 is plan view of the invention. Figure 4 is a plan view of a feature of the invention. PREFERRED MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Referring to Figures 1, 2 and 3, there is shown a carousel rod loader 10 depicted in front, side and top views respectively.Inasmuch as the loader 10 utilizes hydraulic fluids to provide motive power, the various fluid lines and couplings have been deleted for the purposes of clarity. However, from the ensuing discussion, one skilled in the art should have no difficulty understanding how the loader 10 operates or is constructed. Turning now to Figure 1, there is also shown an in the hole drill of the type described in the aforementioned Canadian patent application 444,715. For ease of discussion, reference shall be made, from time to time, to drill 1 2. The drill 12 includes rotary drive head 78 and drill mast 80. However, the instant loader 10 is not limited for use with the drill 12. Rather, with suitable modifications it may be used with any similar drill. The loader 10 may be subdivided into four related sections.Section 14 includes the supporting frame 16 which includes wheels 18 and hydraulic jacks 20. A corresponding set of wheels 18 to the left of the drill 12 have been deleted from the figures. The second section 22 includes means for storing drill rods.Rod carousel 24 rotates about axis 26 in the directions shown by arrows A by motor 28. The carousel 24 is a drum having partitions 30 and longitudinal slots 32. The slots 32 run along the entire side of the carousel 24 and allow a drill rod to pass therethrough. An arcuate cage 34, circumscribing the carousel 24, also rotates about the axis 26 through an arc defined by arrows B. Hydraulic cylinder 36 rotates the cage 34. The cage 34 is large enough to cover the slots 32 to prevent the rods not shown from falling out of the carousel 24 when the carousel 24 is rotated. Third section 38 provides the means for removing or loading drill rods from or to the carousel 24 and taking the rods from a horizontal position to a vertical position and vice versa. The third section 38 includes first arm 40 and first rod clamp 42. The first arm 40 pivots about axis 44 in the arc defined by arrows C and is caused to rotate by hydraulic cylinder 46. The figures depict the first arm 40 in a vertical position. The first arm 40 is mounted so that when the arm 40 is lying in the horizontal plane the cylinder 46 is extended , it lies parallel and adjacent to one of the longituinal slots 32 in the carousel 24. i, . The first rod clamp 42, actuated by cylinder 48 alternately grasps and releases a rod cradled by the first ann 40. Indeed the rod will rest in cradles 50 which are passive support members.Cylinder 51 causes the clamp 42 to rotate in the arc defined by arrows D about pivot axis 52. Actuator 54 causes the first arm 40 to travel in the back and forth direction depicted by directional arrowsE. The fourth section 56 includes means for releasably grasping the rod, taking and returning the rod to the third section 38, and transferring it to and from the drill 12. The fourth section 56 includes second arm 58 and second rod clamp 60. The clamp 60 consists of two sets of spring loaded grasping arms 62. The arms 62 are actuated by cylinders 64. Actuator 66, disposed within the second arm 58, causes the second rod clap 60 to slide in the direction shown by arrows F. An actuator not shown rotates the second rod clamp 60 through an arc defined by arrows G about axis 68. Both the third and fourth sections 38 and 56 rotate about axis 70 through the arc formed by arrows H. By moving separately or in tandem, the sections 38 and 56 will mimic and track the exact angle of the drill 12. Cylinder 72 allows the sections 38 and 56 to pivot about the axis 70 independently of each other. The second arm 58 is spring mounted 74 to allow the second rod clamp 60 to downwardly pivot about axis 76 through the arc defined by arrows I. Should too much downward pressure be brought to bear on a rod by the rotary drive head 78 while it is still held by the second rod clasp 60, the second arm 58 will pivot downwardly out of harm s way. When the excessive pressure is released, the springs 74 will cause the rod via the am 58 to again assume the correct orientation. The invention and manner of applying it, may perhaps be better understood by a brief discussion of the principles underlying the invention. Assume first that the drill 12 is set up for drilling and the carousel 24 is loaded up with rods. Further assume that both arms 40 and 58 are vertical and centered as per the figures and that the clamps 42 and 60 are open. The following general loading sequence applies 1 First arm 40 rotates clockwise about axis 44 to the horizontal position. 2 Rod cage 34 rotates counterclockwise B to position shown uncovering top slot 32.3 Rod rolls into first arm 40 and is cradled therein. At same time dogs not shown in drum 24 roll up to stop rods behind initial rod from exiting drum.4 Rod cage 34 rotates clockwise about B to close off exit.5 First rod clamp 42 on first arm 40 closes.6 First arm 40 rotates counterclockwise about axis 44 to parallel alignment with drill mast 80.7 First arm 40 and second arm 58 rotates about axis 70 to parallel alignment with drill mast 80 if necessary .8 Second arm 58 rotates about axis 68 clockwise to a stop point aligned with first arm 40 .9 Second arm 58 extends along t F t to travel limit as second arm clamp 60 travels around rod.10 Second arm clamp 60 closes.11 First arm clamp 42 opens.12 Second arm 58 retracts along F . a3 Second arm 58 rotates counter clockwise about axis 68 to a stop point aligned with rotary drive head 78 .14 Second am 58 extends along F to travel limit.15 Rotary head 78 lowers while rotating clockwise as viewed from top .16 Once drive head 78 has engaged rod threads adequately, second arm clamp 60 opens.17 Second arm 58 retracts along F .18 Second arm 58 rotates clockwise about axis 68 to start position.19 First arm 40 rotates about axis 70 to start position. To unload rod, the following steps occur 1 Second arm 58 rotates counterclockwise about axis 68 to stop position previously aligned with head 78 . 2 Second am 58 extends along F as second arm clamp 60 travels around rod. 3 Second arm clamp 60 closes. 4 Rotary drive head 78 rotates counterclockwise as viewed from top and travels up releasing rod. The rod immediately below is locked by a wrench as to allow the upper rod to removed. See Figure 4. 5 Second arm 58 retracts along F . 6 Second arm 58 rotates about axis 68 clockwise to stop position aligned with first arm 40 . 7 Second arm 58 extends along F . 8 First arm clamp 42 closes.9 Second am clamp 60 opens.10 Second arm 58 retracts along F . 11 First arm 40 rotates about axis 70 to vertical position if necessary in parallel alignment with the drum 24.12 First arm 40 rotates about axis 44 clockwise to align with drum axis 26 horizontal .13 First arm 40 upwardly extends along E . 14 Drum rotates counterclockwise about axis 26. 15 First arm clamp 42 rotates about axis 52 clockwise to dump rod.16 First arm clamp 42 opens.17 First arm clamp 42 rotates counterclockwise about axis 52 to rest position.18 First arm 40 retracts along E . 19 First arm 40 rotates about axis 44 counterclockwise to rest position. The drill 12 must be slightly modified to accomodate the fully automatic nature of the loader 10. The rotary drive head 78 not only must be threaded to accomodate the rod but also must be equipped with two actuatable dogs to grab the rod. When the head rotates the rod, this permits the connection between rod to be made or broken with the rod immediately below it. Secondly, the lower work table of the drill 12 should have a locking means to grasp the lower rod when the upper rod is either being connected or disconnected from the lower rod. By the same token this locking means should move out of the way when the drill string is being rotated by the rotary head 78. Accordingly, figure 4 depicts a table wrench 82 for mounting on the lower work table of the drill 12. The wrench includes cylinder 84 registered with slide 86. The slide 86 includes an aperture 88 that contains a squared off collar section 90 and an arcuate section 92. The wrench 82 has a fixed lower circular section 94 sized to accomodate a rod. When the cylinder 84 is extended as is shown inFigure 4 , the collar section 90 is registered against the flat portion of the drill tube, therby locking it in position so that the drill rod above it may be connected or removed. During drilling, the cylinder 84 is retracted causing the arcuate section 94 of the slide 86 to match the circular section 94. The loader 10 may manually controlled, fully automatic, or somewhere in between. However, with the appropriate computer software and sensing devices the loader 10 may be set up and allowed to drill without any supervision. The loader 10 will carry its own drill rods and automatically load the drill as the need arises. Depending on the depth of the hole to be drilled, the appropriate number of drill rods are stored in the carousel 24. The loader 10 will then automatically connect the rod to the rotary drive head 78 and commence drilling. Upon sensing that an additional rod is needed, the drill 12 will stop, lock the rod via wrench 82 and cause the rotary head 78 to unscrew itself from the rod. Another rod will be taken from the carousel 24, connected to the rotary head 78 and rod already in place and the drilling process will continue. The loader 10 may also be programed to sense obstructions, bit wear and angle deviations and correct for these problems. If the loader 10 cannot correct these difficulties on its own, it will signal for human assistance. Still always the best kind The loader 10, by reversing its steps can remove each rod and return them to the carousel 24. While in accordance with the provisions of the statute, there is illustrated and described herein specific embodiments of the invention. Thos skilled in the art will understand the changes may be made in the form of the invention covered by the claims and the certain features of the invention may sometimes be used to advantage without a corresponding use of the other features.
