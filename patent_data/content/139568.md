# Message oriented interrupt mechanism for multiprocessor systems.

## Abstract
An interrupt mechanism for digital computer systems has a message oriented format which requires no additional lines for implementation beyond those normally provided for transmission of data and control signals between de vices. The interrupt may be directed to any number of device, and at any number of priority levels the first device available at the appropriate priority level will service the interrupt. The operation of the interrupt mechanism is location independent accordingly, the system may be configured, and dynamically reconfigured, free of constrictions imposed by the interrupt mechanism.

## Description
MESSAGE ORIENTED INTERRUPT MECHANISM FOR MULTIPROCESSOR SYSTEMS A. Field of the Invention The invention relates to digital computer architecture and, more particularly, to means for interconnecting for communication with each other such diverse devices as processors, memory main memory and I O devices such as mass storege e.g. disks and tapes , console terminals, printers, and other such devices in a digital computer system. The particular invention clsicd herein relates to a message oriented interrupt mechanism for multiprocessor systems. B. Prior Art As the cost of digital computer systems and their components continues to decrease, more and more different types of data handling devices are being interconnect23 into these syste.ns. The devices have widely varying characteristics with respect to speed i.e., the rate at nich they can accept or transmit data , required control information, data format, and other such characteristics, yet they must communicate with each other. For example, processors must often communicate with main memory very high speed , mass storage devices such as disk memory high spared , and output devices such as printers very low sPeed . An important aspect of an interconnecting means is its ability to support arbitration among the competing demands of devices wishing to communicate with each other. Some form of arbitration must be performed to grant a request for access to the communications path, and thus it is essential that the arbitration process be efficient, since it may otherwise consume an undue portion of th computer systern1s resources. Further, it is generally desirable that th arbitration process provide some measure of flexibility in allocating the communications path among the requesting devices.In environments which allow a wide variety of devices to be attached to the co munications path, particularly in environ nents which additionally allow the connection of multiple processors to the communications path, the competing demands on the arbitration mechanism often lead to undesirable constraints on system operation and flexibility. Another important aspect of an interconnecting means is its support of interrupts. The manner in which these interrupts are posted often results in significant restrictions on the achievable flexibility of device attachment to the communications path. In addition to providing communications among devices attached to a single central processor, it is frequently desirable to provide access between such devices and one or more additional processors, as well as between the several processors themselves. This requirement of communication among processors adds substantially increased complexity to the interconnection problem because of the need to insure coordinated operation.One aspect of interprocessor communications that requires particular attention is the problem cause by utilization of caches on one or more of the pro essors. Such caches can cause processin3 errors if appropriate steps are not taken to insure tnat z ccess to thc cache is allowed only when the cached data is valid , that is, has not been altered in main memory since it was cached. If cache control is not performed efficiently, the performance of the system as a whole may be significantly degraded. Brief Description of the Invention A. Objects of the Invention Accordinglyl it is an object of th2 invention to provide an improved means for interconnecting diverse devices in a digital computer system. Further, it is an object of the invention to provide an improved means for interconnecting devices in a digital computer system that allows attachment of a wide variety of devices with minimal attachment restrictions. Still a further object of the invention to provide an improved means for interconntecting devices that efficiently accom odates interrupts, including interprocessor interrupts. Yet another objcrt of this invention is to provide a means for interconnecting devices in a digital computer system that provides an effectivc mechanism for servicing interrupts. B. Su nm ry Ascription oi the Invention This application is direct to one of several related aspects of the interconnecting means. Specifically, it is directed to the means by which access to a communications path is granted to the devices seeking access at a given time. Because of the interrelation among the separate aspects of the complete system, the structure of the complete system will be described as a whole first, and those aspects specific to the present invention will then be described in somewhat further detail. The claims set forth herein define the specific invention of the present application, namely, th means for determining and granting access to a communications path. 1. General Description Of The lnterconnectingMeans The interconnecting means described herein is associated with, and preferably forms part of, each device to be interconnected. It controls the transmission and reception of signals on a communications path e.g., a parallel wired bus interconnecting each of the devices. IFe interconnecting means provides uniform control of comnunications among the devices interconnected by the communications path. These devices are connected in parallel to the communications path, and their operation is independent of physical placement on the path.Each device connected to the comunications path is assigned an identification number In which is used for a number of purposes as described hereafter. In one i iple nentation of the interconnecting means, the assignment is m de by a physical plug inserted into the device and wire to specify the identification number. Since this physical plug may be moved from slot to slot, there is no logical dependency between the device and the slot in which it resides. This number is loaded into a control register during system initialization, and is thereafter available for use by the device. The interconnecting means implements a specific set of commands providing efficient communication between devices. Tnese commands are implemented and trans.nitted in a number of diffcrent operations hereinafter called transactions . Each transaction is subdivided into a number of cycles, including a Command Address cycle in wnich the operation code for the particular transaction e.g., Read, Write,Interrupt, etc. is transmitted over the bus to other devices, together with information identifying the devices to whicn the command is directed or providing other information pertinent to the command anImbedded Arbitration cycle for identifying the device wnich will next be allowed access to the communications path and one or more data cycles in wnich user data i.e., the ultimate object of the processing or other information is transmitted. The transaction signals are transmitted òver the communications path via separate groups of lines referred to herein as Information Transfer Class lines, Response Class lines, ControlClass lines, and Power Class lines. Except for Time and Phase Signals described later these signals are detected as being assert wh ne cr one or more interconnecting means asserts them. The InformationTransfer Class lines, in turn, comprise Information,Data and Parity lines, and transmit command, data status and certain other information used in the transaction. Tne response Class Lines provide positive confirmation of error free reception, as well as additional responses to control or alter the transaction. This error monitoring significantly contributes to system reliability, requires little or no additional bandwidth, and allows the responding device to alter th2 normal progress of the transaction, thus contributing greatly to system flexibility.For example, a device which requires additional time to respond to a command directed to it beyond that normally provided for by the command may utilize one or more of the response signals to delay completion of the transaction within predetermined limits until the device is ready to respond, or may notify the device of its inability to respond at that time and thus free the communications paths for other transactions. set of control signals is generated and utilized by the interconnecting means in each device to provide efficient and orderly transfer of access to the communications path from one device to another. Additionally, each device generates local timing signals from a common system clock to thereby insure synchronous operation. These signals, as well as test control signals, are also transmitted on separate lines over the bus. Finally, the devices monitor the status ot the n and DC powr within the systen, and provide signals indicating the status of these power sources so that appropriate action may be taken when necessary. Tne interconnecting means described herein is unusually powerful and versatile, and readily lends itself to economical manufacture by large scale integration techniques currently available. This results from the relatively limited number of, physically separate wires required to carry the command, control, information and data signals among devices, arising from the efficient selection and distribution of functions among these lines.Nontheless, the interconnecting means imposes essentially no restrictions on the physical placement of the devices attached to it. Further, it allows interconnection of a wide variety of devices, and efficiently accomodates both single processor and multi processor configurations. 2. general Description of th2 Specific InventionDefined Herein In accordance with the invention specifically defined in this application, eaçh device which setks control of thn path in order to engage in a transaction with other devices monitors the NO AR3 control line. I,henever NO ARM is found to be deasserted, the device may arbitrate in the following cycle. this cycle may be a idle arbitration cycle, that is, one which occurs at times when no current transaction is taking place on the ptay, or may be an imbedded arbitration cycle, that is, one which occurs during the progress of a transaction on the path. On detecting an arbitration cycle, each such device asserts a s R3 and single line corresponding to its priority. Thr signals are asserted in decoded form i.e., as on2 of N , wnere N is the number of different priority levels provided for on the data lines of the communications path. At the same time, each device monitors the data lines and makes its own determination as to whether it is the device which has a redefined priority characteristic among those devices arbitrating.In the particular implenentation specifically described herein, arbitration is performed at two priority levels, namely high and low. Further, within each level there is a sublevel priority ranking from high to low in inverse relation to the device identification number, that is, the sut level priority decreases as the identification number increas2s. As particularly described herein, each device determines for itself whether it is the hiqhest priority device arbitrating for access to the communications path at that time.The device determining that is the highest priority device seeking access assumes the status of Pending Mastery and continues to assert r ARB to prevent other devices from arbitrating for control of the communications path until it assumes control of the path. The Pending 4aster can assume control of the communications path on the cycle following that in which BSY is deasserted and thereby become CurrentMaster. Further in accordance with the present invention, arbitration is performed not only at different priority levels, but also in different modes. Specìfically, a inode control means is provided t establish arbitration by a device at one of a number of fixed priority levels or on 3 dynamically changing basis for exa nple, on a oual round robin arbitration mode as described hereafter . Further, the device may be set to disable arbitration this prevents it from gaining control of the communications path. Arbitration mode control is tst3blished via a control register which is accessible to, and p tential1y changeable by, all devices in the system. Thus the arbitration node of the device nay be altered as required in accorWanc with system needs. Further, in tne dual round robin mode, access to the communications pathway is provided on a basis which gives essentially equal access to the devices over 3 period of tim . The term dual round robin is used heroin to cnaractarize the behavior of the dynamic arbitration mode of th interconnecting means, as opposed to a pure round robin scheme. In the latter, if all devices connected to the communications path are in this mode, each obtains control of the path exactly once before any devicè obtains control of the path a second time.In the du l round robin mode, in contrast, two round robin rings1 are established, each in itself a pure round robin.This results from using the It of nthe previous communications path Master in the priority calculation. These rings are effectivety overlapped, and the dual round robin mode thus provides the same fairness as pure round robin to the extant that no device is ever locked out of control of the communications path, and in th worst case latency for any device is the some as in pure round robin. If greater bandwidth is needed by a device at any particular time, the arbitration priority mode of that device may be changed from a dynamic mode toça fixed mode, specifically including a fixed Kigh priority mode.In this .moze, the given device will be pr ovided with access to the communications pathway a laxer proportion of time than otherwise, and thus may transfer even greater amounts of data over a period of time. Each device operating in the dual round robin mode of arbitration compares its identification number during each Imbedded Arbitration cycle with the identification number of the Current Master. If the identification number ot a given device is higher than the identification number of the Current Master, the device updates its priority to the high priority level otherwise, its priority remains in, or is set to, the low priority level.The decision to arbitrate in a particular Imbecided Arbitration cycle is made prior to updating priority in that cycle so that the arbitration decision is based on the identification number of the previous Master. Accordingly, devices which have low 1D numbers and which otherwise might deny access to the communications path by high ID devices are periodically demoted to a low priority level. The interconnecting means of the present invention provides si nificant benefits. To begin with, it uses only a single additional line in the com nunications path to provide the facilities for the arbitration process. The remaining lines required for the arbitration are provided by the data lines which are necessarily present to transmit th data which is the end object of the intercommunication.Thus, the systems acco nodates itself to implementation on a single integrated circuit, an advantage which is significant, and oftentimes critical, in constructing an economical syse. Further, thn arbitration system provides an extremely flexible manner of allocating resources an. ong competing devices seeking access to a limited facility, the communications path. The allocation of relativ priorities among the devices may be changed in a predefined manner among devices competing for access at given times, or may be changed in accordance with varying system demands.Further, because arbitration is distributed among all devices connected to the communications path, the multiple li nes, physical placement constraints, and significant overhead usually associated with centralized arbitration is eliminated. Accordingly, it comprises a powerful and unusually flexible mode of operation.

Detailed Description of the Interconnecting fleas Fig. 1A illustrat s the utilization of the interconnecting means described herein in a configuration typical of small and relatively inexpensive computer systems. As there illustrated, a processor 10, memory 12, terminals 14 and mass storage units disks 16 are interconnected to each other via interconnecting means 18 and a communications path 20.in the case of processor 10 and memory 12, the interconnectins means 18 are preferably located integrally within the device and thus provide the communications interface to the device. In the case of the terminals 14 and stor3 e units 16, intermediate adaptcrs 22, 24, respectively, may be provided in order to allow the connection of a number of terminal or stora3e devices to a single interconnecting means 18. The adapters serve to interface the communications path 20 to the remainder of the device. As utilized herein, the term device1 denotessone or more entities connect to tha communications path by a common interconnecting means. Thus, in Fig. 1A, the terminals 14 and adapter 22 comprise a single device 2b similarly, processor 10 and main memory 12 are eacn devices. In Fig. 1B, the processor 32 and memory 34, together with adapter 40 comprise a single device. In Fig. , it will be noted that the processor 10 shares the memory 12 with the other devices connected to communications path 20. this results in lower system cost, but limits system speed because of the need to share the path 20. In Fig. 1B, this problem is resolved by providing a separate memory path 30 between a processor 32 and a memory 34. The processor and memory are then connected to terminal devices 36 and mass storage devices 38 via an adapter 40, a path 42, and adapters 46 and 48. The adapter 40 h s an interconnecting means 18 integral with it and connecting the adaptor to the path 42. Similarly adapters 4o and 48 each have an interconnecting means 18 integral therewith and connecting them to the path 42.A system of this type offers higher performance, but at a higher cost. However, it is still fully compatible with tne interconnecting means described herein. Finally, Fig. 1. illustrates the use of the device interconne.ing means in a multi proc ssor systen. In this Figure, processors 50 and 52 are connected to primary memories 54, 56, respectively, by memory paths 56, 60, respectively. The processor memory pairs, in turn, are connected to the remainder of the system via adapters 62, 64, respectively, having interconnecting means 18 incorporated integrally therewith and interconnected by path 68. A cache memory 52 is associated with one of the processors, e.g., processor 50.The remainder of the systems is then sentilly that shown in Fi3. 15, namely, one or more terminals 70 connected to the path 68 via an adapter 72 having an interconnecting means 38 therein, and a mass storage device 74 interconnected to the path 68 via an adapter 76 having an interconnecting means 18. In this configuration, not only can eacn processor communicate with each device in the system, but the processors can communicate directly with each other. Further, cache memory 51 is effectively accommodated.Despite the differing nature and level of complexity imposed by this demanding mixture of devices in the same system, the interconnecting means described herein efficiently controls all the communications in essentially the same way. Turning now to Figure 2, the various categories of signals generated and utilized by interconnecting means are summari2ed in accordance with their principal functional class. swithin each class, they are grouped by their separate subfunctions.Additionally, the specific wires of the group of wires or communications path 78 which carry these signals from one device to another are also shown in order to faciliate subsequent discussion. A line is considered to be asserted if any device attached to the line asserts it. lhc line is deasserted only if no device is asserting it. For purposes of illustration, two separate interconnecting means, designated A and B, respectively, and integral with the corresponding physical devices whose communications they control, are illustrated schematically by the signals utilized by them, and are shown as interconnected for signal exchange purposes by path 78.However, it should be understood that path 78 will typically physically link more tan two devices at any one time, although only those devices selected by the Current Master will actually participatc in a transaction. The remaining devices remain physically connected tothe communications path but do not participate in the transaction. As illustrated in Fig. 2, there ere four broad classes of signals utilized by the interconnecting means, namely, Information Transfer class signals Response class signals Control class signals andPower class signals. The Information Transfers class signals include an Information field, designated 113 0 , which is transmitted and received over four separate lines 80 of the path 78. The Information fiela carries information such as the command code, code identifying the device initiating the transaction the Current Master , and information specifying the status of data transmitted during the cycle, among other information.A thirty two bit data word transmitted over lines 82, labeled D 31 0 in Fig. 2 provides certain information needed in the transaction, such as the length of a data transfer that is to take place used in Read type and Write type transactions the entity of a device which is selected to participate in the transaction the address of memory locations which are to be accessed for data transfer and the data which is to be transferred. This word is transmitted and received over thirty two separate lines 82.Two lines, 84 and Bo, designated P0, used for indicating the parity on the information and data lines, and BAD, signalling an error condition, are also provided lhe Response class of signals comprises a three bit field, designated CNF 2 O and transmitted over lines 88, which provides a response to various information transmitted to a device and which allows the devices to alter the progress of the transactions, as described in ,more detail subsequently. The Control class signals are transmitted over a group of eight lines 90 104. The first of these signals, NO ARB, controls the arbitration process.he second of these, BSY, indicates current control of the communications path by a device. These two signals are used in conjunction with each other to provide an orderly transition of control among devices seeking control of the communications path. Of the remaining signals in the control class, the Time and Time signals comprise waveforms generated by a single source connected to the path 98 and transmitted over lines 94, 96, respectively thçy are used in conjunction with the Phase and Phase waveforms, also generated by a single source, and transmitted over lines 98 and 100, respectively, to establish the local timing reference for operation of the interconnecting means at each device.specifically, the interconnecting means of each device connected to the path 78 generates local transmitting and receiving clock signals, TCLK and RULER, respectively, from the Time and Phase signals.Finally, the STF signal, transmitted over line 102, is used to enable a Fast Self Testy of tht local devices, as described in more detail hereinafter, while the RIDER signal, transmitted over line 104, provides a means of initializing setting to a known status the devices attached to the communications path. In the Power signal class, the AC LO and Dç LO signals are transmitted over lines 104, 106, respectively and are monitored by each device to determine the status of the AC and DO power within the system. A Spare line 110 provides for future expansion. Tne interconnecting means described herein performs its function of establishing communication among selected devices by performing a sequence of operations that are specific to the type of communication to be undertaken. Each operation comprises a sequence of cycles during which various elements of information are placed on, or received from, the communications path in order to effectuate the desired communication with another device or devices also connected to this path. These cycles are defined by the Time and Phase clocks as may be understood more clearly on reference to Fig. 3A which snows Time and Time clock signals 120 and 122, respectively, as well as Phase and Phase signals 124 and 126, respectively. These signals are generated by a single 5aster clock connected to the communications path.They are received by the interconnectin means ofeach device and used to generate the local TCLS and RCLK signals 128 and 130, respectively, which control the transmission and reception of inform tion by tnem. Thus, as snown in Fig. 3B, a number of devices 140, 142, etc. are connected in parallel to the comunications path so as to transit and receive information over these lines. These devices may be input output I O devices such as printers, display terminals, etc. or may be devices such processors. Tht physical placement of the devices on the path is immaterial. A Master Clock 144 also connected to the path generates the Time and Phase signals which are transmitted to each device over lines 94 100. Each interconnecting means includes timing circuitry for generating local transmittin 3 and received3 clocks TCLK and RCLK, respectively. For example, device 140 may include a flip flop 146 whose Q output produces TCLu. The flip flop is set from a gate 148 and is clocked by the Time signal from line 94. Gate 148 in turn is enabled by line 98 and the Q bar output. In similar fashion, the local Slave receive clock, RCLK, is generated from the received Time andPhase signals. As shown in Fig. 3C, the time between successive TCLX signals defines a cycle. A sequence of successive cycles which is utilized to perform a desired interchange of infor.mation is herein called a transaction. Although the detailed characteristics of each transaction varies in accordance with the operation performed by it, each transaction consists, generally, of a Command Address cycle an ImbeddedArbitration cycle and one or more additional cycles, most commonly designated as Data cycles. For purposes of illustration only, two such data cycles are shown in Fig. 3C.In general, information is placed on the communications path 70 at the leading edge of CLK and is latched into th2 interconnecting means of a device during RçLX of the same cycle. A state diagram of thç arbitration function performed by each interconnecting means is shown inFig. 3D. The arbitration function remains in the idle state 150 until some element in the device causes it to seek to initiate a transaction as indicated by REQ in Fig. 3D. hen this occurs, the interconnecting means determines whether it is free to assert ,its arbitration signals on the path 78 by examining the NO ARB line. As long as ND ARB is asserted, the arbitration function must remain in the idle state.However, as soon as ND ARB is deassert2d, the device may arbitrate durin the following cycle, provided that LC is still asserted. Under these, conditions, it enters the arbitr3tion state 152 in which the device arbitrates with other devices seeking access to the communications path. The manner of arbitration will be described in more detail hereinafter. A device losing the arbitration returns to the idle state 150, from which it may again seek to arbitrate as long as REQ is asserted. Conversely, a device winning the arbitration enters either theCurrent .taster state if BSY is deasserted or thePending kla5ttr state if BSY is asserted. A PendingMaster remains Pending Haster as long as BSY is asserted, and becomes Current aster following the deassertion of BSY. Before describing the operation sequence of each of the transactions provided for by the interconnect, it will be helpful to obtain a more detailed understanding of sone of the Control, Response, and Infornation Transfer class signals themselves, as these are common to essentially all the transaction typos. Control Signals N3 AR3, BSY Tne AS signal controls access to the data lines for purposes of arlitration. Devices may arbitrate for use of the communications path only in those cycles for whicn ND ARB has been deasserted for the previous cycle.The device which has control of the interconnect the Current Master asserts NO ARB throughout the transaction except during the first cycle and the last expected data cycle. The last expected data cycle of a transaction is usually the last data cycle in fact however, as described more fully hereafter, devices may delay completion of a transaction under certain conditions. When they do, the cycle that is expected to b2 the last data cycle no longer is, and subsequent cycles follow before all the data is transferred. NO ARB is also asserted by tne Pending taster until it becomes the Current Master. At any one time, there is at most only oneCurrent Master and one Pending Master. NO ARB is also asserted during an arbitration cycle by all arbitrating devices. During an ImbeddedArbitration cycle, this assertion is in addition to the assertion of ND ARB by the Current Master. During an Idle Arbitration cycle, assertion of NO ARB by an arbitrating device will preclude subsequent arbitrations until one of the devices currently arbitrating becomes Current Master. NO ARB is additionally asserted by Slave devices devices selected by the Current Master for all cycles in wnich the Slave asserts STALL, as well as for all data cycles except the last. It is also asserted by a device coincidentally with assertion ofBSY during special modes wnen the interconnecting means is occupied servicing its own device. In these modes, the device dozes not use any communications path lines other than BY and NO ARB Due to the potential of being selected as Slave, a device prevented from entering a special mode during a command address cycle. A device may operate in a special mode, for example, in order to access registers in the interconnecting means without requiring use of. Information Transfer class lines of the communication5 path. Further, it may also be desirable to allow the Current Plaster to continue assertion of NO ARB beyond its usual termination cycle to thereby perform a sequence of transactions without relinguishing control of the communications patn. This would be particularly useful for high speed devices to allow extended information transfer cycles, and thus effectively increase tne available bandwidth for that device. BSY indicates that a transaction is in progress.It is asserted by the Current Master during the entire transaction, except during the last expected cycle.It is also asserted by Slave devices which need to delay progress of the transaction e.g., a memory device which needs additional time to access a particular memory location the delay is accomplished by asserting BSY and NO ARB together with a STALL response code to be described later . In addition,BSY is also asserted for all data cycles except the last. A device may also extend the assertion of BSY in order to delay the start of the next transaction, or when operating in the special modes discussed above. BSY is examined by devices at the end of each cycle when deasserted, a Pending Master may assert it and assume control as Current Master. Figure 3E is a state diagram of possibly sequences of the BSY and NO ARB control lines in the present implementation. It will be used to illustrate the manner in which the joint observation these signals efficiently control the exchange of information from device to device on the communications path. On the power up all devices assert NO ARB State A effectively preventing access by any device until all devices deassert the line State B , whenever the communications path enters the IDLE state. This allows time for all devices to complete any power up initialization sequence if required. Once NO ARB is desasserted and State B is thereby entered, devices may freely seek to contend for control of the communications path. Once a device arbitrates, State A is again entered whereupon the winning device enters Command Address State C . It is important to note that this Command Address cycle is recognized by all devices not only by the transition assertions of BSY from the deasserted to the aserted state but in conjunction with the assertion of NO ARB in the previous cycle.Tne observation of NO ARB is necessitated for devices to ignore the special mode state as a Command Address. The first entry of State D from the C ommand Address state is indicative of the Imbedded Arbitration cycle of a transaction. It is this cycle that devices update their dynamic priority if in usual round robin mode by observation of the encoded Master ID. Depending on the data length of the transaction, control may remain in this state for subsequent cycles. If no arbitration occurs, the Master and Slave eventually relinquish control of the communications path and flow proceeds again back to State B , the deassertion of both control signals. If, however, a Pending Master exists, state F will be subsequently entered, whereupon the device asserting NO ARB will notice the deassertion of BSY in this cycle and proceed either to Command Address C or G depending on whether the decision to preclude further arbitration by other devices referred to as BURST MODE in the diagram is determined by the Master. Note that in State G the Command Address control signals show that NO ARB and BSY are both asserted which differentiates this from Com nand Address State inc . If the previous transaction was extended by the assertion of BSY, and no Pending Master had existed, control would have sequenced from State D to E and remain in State E for one or more cycles as required. The witnessed assertion of BSY would cause control to remain in this state for one or more cycles, whereupon the sequence may continue back toIDLE State B and relinquish the communications path for future transfers. As described above, a special mode of operation may have alternatively caused control to return toState D for one or more cycles if one particular device wished preclusion of selection as a Slave by any other device. The simultaneous deassertion of BSY and NO ARB would then again return control to State B , the IDLE condition. The figure therefore shows that the joint operation of NO ARB and BSY regulates the orderly flow of control exchange as well as information transfer on the communications path. Response Signals ACK, ND ACK, STALL, RETRY System reliability is greatly increased by requiring a response to transmissions over the Information and Data lines. Generally, response is expected exactly two cycles after the particular transmission. The response code for these devices is shown in Fig. 6, where a O bit indicates assertion low level and a 1 bit indicates deassertion high level . The ACK response indicates successful completion of a transmission reception by the intended recipient of the transmission. For all transaction types, the assertion of ACK during the first data cycle of the transaction confirms correct receipt i.e., no parity error of the Command Address information transmitted two cycles earlier. Additionally, in the first data cycle as well as in subsequent data cycles in Read type and Ident transactions, ACK also indicates that read or vector data is being asserted by the Slave, while in Write type transactions ACK also indicates that the Slave is prepared to accept Write data. NO ACK indicates either a failure in the transmission reception or that no Slave has been selected. Both ACK and NO ACK are permissible responses to command transmissions, as well as to data transmissions in the latter case, the responses occur through the two cycles following the last data cycle, even though these cycles may coincide with a subsequent transaction. NO ACK is the default state of the response lines. It is defined in such a way that any other code may override it. STALL may be asserted by a Slave device during data cycles. For example, it is used by memories to extend the time allowed for a read access or to provide time for a refresh or error correction cycle during a transaction. It is also used by memories to delay further data transmission from the Master when the memory write buffer is full. It is used by devices to synchronize to another communication path. One or more STALLS may be used to delay an ACK or NOACK command confirmation if the device recognizes that it is the Slave. RETRY is asserted by a Slave device which cannot immediately respond to a transaction. For example, it is used by devices requiring a long internal initialization sequence by devices waiting for access to another communications path and by memories which have been locked by an Interlock Read command as described below. The Current Master responds to theSlave RETRY response by terminating the transaction.In the present implementation, RETRY is not used after the first data cycle of a transaction. This simplifies the interconnection logic. One or more STALLS may precede the assertion of Retry. In order to prevent a device from monopolizing the communications path, a limit is placed on the extensions or successive assertions of STALL, RETRY,BSY and NO ARB. System Architecture Specific Transaction Sequences Figs. 4A H set forth in detail the specific characteristics of the transactions provided for by the interconnecting means. In particular, transactions for reading and writing data READ, READWITH CACHE INTENT, INTERLOCK READ WITH CACHE INTENT,WRITE, WRITE WITH CACHE INTENT, WRITE MASK WITH CACHEINTENT, and UNLOCK WRITE MASK WITH CACHE INTENT for invalidating obsolete cached data INVALIDATE for handling interrupts INTERRUPT, INTERPROCESSORINTERRUPT, IDENTIFY for halting transaction generation by devices STOP and for transmitting information to a number of devices simultaneously BROADCAST are illustrated in detail. In each of theFigures, the range of permissible CNF responses is set forth, and the particular response illustrated is marked by a dot . .Further, for purposes of illustration only, the transactions are shown as including only two cycles of data transfer although a larger or smaller number of cycles may be used. The commands described herein are of two general types, namely, single responder commands Read type,Write type commands, and IDENTIFY and multi responder commands TOP, INVALIDATE, INTERRUPT, INTERPROCESSOR INTERRUPT, and BROADCAST . In order to insure the unique recognition of responses when multiple responses are being asserted on the same lines, the permissible responses to multi responder commands are limited to ACK and NO ACK. Read Type Transactions Referring now to Fig. 4A, the characteristics of a Read type transaction are set forth in detail. This type of transaction includes not only the READ command, but also the READ WITH CACHE INTENT and theINTERLOCK READ WITH CACHE INTENT commands as well.The four bit codes for these commands are shown inFig. 5A, together with the codes for the other commands utilized by the device interconnecting means.Note that additional codes may subsequently be added, as indicated by the dash in this Figure. The transaction comprises a number of successive cycles, namely, a command address cycle 180, an ImbeddedArbitration cycle 182, and a number of data cycles.For purposes of illustration only, the transaction is shown as including two data cycles lss4, 186, respectively. The principal lines on which information is transmitted cf. Fig. 2 are indicated by their functional names, namely, the Information lines I13 0 , the Data lines D131 0 , the Confirmation linesCNFI3 0 , and the NO ARB, BSY and P parity lines.For clarity of illustration, the remaining lines i.e., Time, Phase, STF, RESET, AC LO, DC LO, BAD andSPARE are omitted in Fig. 4 since they are not essential to understanding the operation of the transactions. As indicated in Fig. 4A, during the command address cycle of a Read type transaction, the four bit command code is placed on the information lines I 3 01. Additional data required in connection with the command is placed on the data lines D131 Oi. Specifically, a two bit data length code specifying the length of the transfer which is to take place is applied by the interconnecting means to data lines Do31 301, while the address of the device with which the transfer is to take place is applied to data lines D129 0j. The fact that these signals are asserted on the appropriate lines by the device which currently has control of the interconnect the Current Master is indicated by the letter M in the appropriate block in Fig. 4A. The assertion of information on a given line or set of lines by a Slave device is indicated by the letter S in Fig. 4A.In similar fashion, the letters AD , AAD , APS and PM i.e. All Devices , All Arbitrating Devices, AllPotential Slaves , and Pending Master , respectively indicate various other devices which may assert signals on selected lines of the communications path during particular cycles. The address comprises a single thirty bit word designating the specific storage location with which aRead type or Write type transaction is to take place. A separate block of addresses is assigned to each device. The location of the block is based on the identification number of the associated device. During the Command Ad ress cycle, the Current Master deasserts NO ARB as shown at 158 in Fig. 4A. For purposes of discussion herein, a signal is considered asserted when at a low level, and deasserted when at a high level . Deassertion of ND ARB allows other devices desiring control of the communications path to arbitrate for such access during the following cycle. At the same time, the device asserts BSY to prevent other devices from gaining control of the communications path while the current transaction is in process. No signals are applied to the CNF lines at this time by the CurrentMaster, although it should be understood that, in the course of a sequence of transactions, one or moreResponse signals may be applied to the CNF lines by other devices during a transaction by a CurrentMaster. The second cycle of the transaction comprises an arbitration cycle. It is referred to as an imbedded arbitration cycle since it is contained within a transaction. Arbitration which occurs outside of a transaction is referred to as an Idle arbitration cycle. During the Imbedded Arbitration cycle of Fig. 9, the Current Master places its identification number ID on the information lines 113 0 . This code is used by all devices to update their arbitration priority, as previously described. At this time also, those devices seeking use of the communications path assert a single bit signal corresponding to their identification number on either the low priority level lines, Do31 16 , or the high priority level lines D115 O , e.g., device 11 asserts line D 11 if arbitrating at high priority and asserts line D1273 if arbitrating at low priority. The level at which the device arbitrates is determined by its arbitration mode as well as by theID of the previous Master. In the present implementation, the arbitration mode is defined by bits 4 and 5 of the particular device s control and status register, i.e., CSRI5 4 see Fig. 7C . As presently implemented, four modes are provided for, namely, fixed high priority, fixed low priority, dual round robin , and arbitration disabled. The interconnecting means supports mixing these modes at will by appropriately setting the arbitration mode bits CSR 5 4 . In the case of arbitration in a fixed priority mode, whether fixed high or fixed low, the priority does not vary from transaction to transaction. In contrast, in the case of dual round robin arbitration the priority of a device may change from one transaction to another as described previously. In particular, in the dual round robin arbitration mode, during a given transaction, a device will arbitrate at a low priority level i.e., on lines Do31 16 if its ID number is equal to or less than the ID number of the Master in the immediately preceding transaction, and will arbitrate at a high priority level i.e., lines D115 0 otherwise. Continuing on with the transaction of Fig. 44, at the conclusion of the Imbedded Arbitration cycle, a device which has arbitrated during this cycle and won the arbitration becomes Pending Master, and asserts NO ARB until it becomes Current Master, as shown in dotted lines in Fig. 4A. This prevents other devices from subsequently arbitrating for, and çossibly gaining control of, the communications path before the Pending Master can assume such control. The arbitration cycle is followed by one or more data cycles. For purposes of illustration, Fig. 4A shows two such data cycles only. As noted previously, the actual amount of data to be transferred in each transaction, and thus the number of data cycles utilized by the transaction, is specified in the command address cycle by bits D131 303. In the particular implementation described in Fig. 4A, from one to four cycles of data here, 32 bits per cycle may be transmitted in a transaction. Of course, by providing fewer or more bits for the data length specification, a lesser or greater number of data cycles, and thus transaction cycles, may be provided for. In the case of a Read type transaction as shown in Fig. 4A, the data called for by the transaction is supplied by the Slave to which the transaction is addressed. This device may be a memory device or it may be some other device such as an input output terminal. In either event, the device so selected asserts its data on the data lines D 31 O during the data cycle. At this time, also, it asserts a code on lines I 3 0 which indicates the status of the data.For example, for memory references, the code may indicate whether the data is data that has been retrieved without utilization of any correction algorithms referred to imply as read data , data that has been corrected before being asserted on the data lines referred to as corrected read data or data that, for one reason or another, cannot be relied on read data substitute . Further, the status code indicates whether or not, for each of these data categories, the data may be cached. The use of the don t cache facility will greatly enhance performance in some systems. These codes are illustrated in Fig. SB. During the first data cycle, the Slave returns to the Master a confirmation code on lines CNFj2 O which confirms receipt of the Command Address information from the aster and whicn may provide further information to the Master with respect to the Slave s response. Thus, the first assertion of the confirmation signals, for the current transaction, is made during the first data cycle, two cycles after the Command Address cycle which began the transaction.For the Read transaction described in Fig. 4A, the permissible responses in the first data cycle are theACK Acknowledge , NO ACK Not Acknowledge , STALL and RETRY. These are largely common to all transactions, with certain exceptions which will be described in connection with the particular transactions. In general, the asssertion of ACK during the first data cycle indicates correct receipt ofCommand Address information, together with the ability of the Slave to take the requested action, i.e., return read data. Conversely, the assertion of NO ACK indicates either an error in transmission of the command or some other inability of a Slave to respond.Tne assertion of STALL allows the Slave to extend the transaction in order to prepare itself to provide the read data requested by the waster, while the assertion of RETRY indicates current inability to respond to the command, accompanied by a request that the Master try again at a subsequent time. RETRY is appropriately used when the expected response time of the Slave would be so long that it would be undesirable to extend the transaction an excessive number of cycles by asserting general STALL responses. In Fig. 4A, the ACK response designated by a dot . before the response is illustrated. If the response were ND ACK, the action taken by the Master would differ from that taken in response to ACK, e.g., the ,Master may seek to repeat the transaction a limited number of times, may call for an interrupt, etc. A STALL response is similar to an ACK response but the transaction will be extended by one or more blank cycles cycles in which no valid data is present on the data lines before the requested data is returned. The second, and last, data cycle in Fig. 4A is similar to the preceeding data cycle, that is, theSlave asserts the requested data on lines D 31 0 together with a code indicating the status of the data on lines I 3 0 . At the sme time, it asserts a confirmation signal on CNFi2 0 . Unlike the Slave s response to the first data cycle, however, the Slave may respond only with ACK, NO ACK, or STALL it may not assert RETRY. Further, since the second data cycle is the last data cycle of the transaction inFig. 4A, the Slave deasserts both NO ARB and BSY.If the Slave were to extend the transaction by assertingSTALL so that the return of read data would be deferred a subsequent cycle, the Slave would continue its assertion of NO ART and BSY until the last data cycle in fact occurred. It would then deassert NO ARB and BSY during that last data cycle. As noted previously, deassertion of BSY allows a Pending Master to assume control of the communications path on the following cycle, while the Slave s deassertion of NOARB is preparatory to allowing subsequent arbitration to occur for access to the communications path. With the completion of the second and last data cycle, the principal information transfer functions of the transaction of Fig. 4A are completed. However, it is still necessary to confirm the correct receipt of the data. This is accomplished during the two cycles following the last data cycle during which the Master asserts the appropriate confirmation signal on CNF 2 0 with respect to receipt of the data. As shown, the appropriate confirmation is either ACK orNO ACK. Note that the confirmation extends beyond the last data cycle and may thus overlap with the Command hddress and Imbedded Arbitration cycles of a following transaction. However, no error will arise from this since the confirmation lines are not used by the following transaction during its first two cycles. During the Command Address cycle parity is generated by the Current Master on the 113 0 and D131 0 lines, and is checked by all devices. Daring the Imbedded Arbitration cycle, it is generated by theMaster on the 113 0 lines only and checked by all devices. During the data cycles, parity is generated by the Slave on the 113 0 and Do31 03 lines and is checked by the Current Master. The specific consequences of a parity error will depend on the nature of the information being transmitted during the given cycle when the error occurs.At a minimum, devices detecting a parity error during the Co ninand Address cycles should not respond to selection additionally, they rnay indicate the parity error by setting an error flag, initiating an interrupt, or other such action. As noted previously, the Read With Cache Intent command has the same format as the Read transaction.It is generated by devices with cache to indicate to the Slave that the rested read data ray be placed in the Master s cache. hen this command is used in conjunction with the INVALIDATE command described below, it can provide a significant performance enhancement in certain systems with cached devices. The Interlock Read transaction also has the same format as the Read transaction. It is used with shared data structures to provide exclusive access to data by processors and other intelligent devices.Slaves supporting the Interlock Read conn,and have one or more interlock bits corresponding to designated storage locations. When accessed by an Interlock ReadCommand, a Slave sets the appropriate bit corresponding to the addressed location. This prevents subsequent Interlock Read accesses to the location until the bit is reset to thereby unlock the given location. This bit is typically reset by theUNLOCK WRITE MASK WITH CACHE INTENT Command described below. The INTERLOCK READ coa,and is especially useful in systems having processors which provide read modify write operations to insure that intervening devices using the Interlock Read Command are precluded from access to data after the initiation, but before the completion, of such an operation.Slaves addressed by INTERLOCK READS while the interlock is set issue a RETRY. Note that the interlock bit is set only if the Interlock Read transaction is successful, i.e., the Master confirms correct receipt of the Slave s read date. Write Type Transaction Turning now to Fig. 4B, the iVrite type transactions as implemented, WRITE, WRITE WITH CACHEINTENT, WRITE MASK WITH CACHE INTENT, and UNLOCK RITE MASK WITH CACHE INTENT are shown in detail. Starting with the Command Address cycle, the current Master places the appropriate four bit code for the command on information lines 1 3 0 a two bit code identifying the length of the data transmission on data lines D131 30 and an address on data lines D 29 03. At the same time, it asserts BSY to indicate the occupied status of the communications path, and deasserts NO ARB to signal the availability of the data lines for arbitration during the immediately following cycle. During the second cycle, the Current Master places its ID on information lines I 3 O . Devices seeking control of the communications path for a subsequent transaction assert a single bit corresponding to their ID on the data lines at this time. As was previously the case, the assertion is made of one of the low priority data lines D 31 16 for arbitration at the low priority level, and is made on the high priority data lines Dl15 0 for arbitration at the high priority level. The Master continues to assert BSY at this time, and the Master, as well as devices participating in the arbitration, assert NO ARB at this time also. In the example shown in Fig. 43, the third and fifth cycles are data cycles. Although two data cycles are shown, a lesser or greater number may be utilized, in accordance with the transfer length specified on lines D131 30J in the Command Adòress cycle. Tne data being written by the Master is applied to data lines D129 03 during these cycles.The Information lines I 3 0 carry either a write mask in the case of a Write Mask transaction during the data cycles to indicate the selected byte or bytes which are to be written during the transaction, or are undefined in the case of Write and Write with Cache Intent transactions . The undefined status of the 113 0 lines indicates that any information on these lines is to be ignored by the devices for purposes of the transaction. During the first data cycle, the Current Master continues to assert BSY and NO ARB. During the fourth data cycle, which the Current aster expects to be the last data cycle, the Current Master deasserts both BSY and NO ARB to prepare for an orderly transition of communications path control. In order to illustrate the capability of a Slave to extend a transaction, the fourth cycle Data 2 is shown as stalled by way of the Slave s assertion ofSTALL. For example, this may be done when the Slave is unable to accept the second data word at this time.The Slave asserts BSY and ND ARB during this cycle.The last data cycle of this transaction is cycle 5.During this cycle the Master responds to the assertion of STALL by retransmitting Data 2. The Slave assertsACK on the CNF lines and the Slave deasserts both BSY and N3 ARB. In the two cycles following the last data cycle, the Slave continues to assert ACK to confirm the correct receipt of Write data. hen a Write type transaction occurs on the communications path, devices connected to the path and having resident cache memory invalidate any cached data within the address range of the write command. As was the case with the REXD ITH CACHE INTENT command, the WRITE WITH CACHE INTENT command, when used with the Invalidate command offers significant performance advantages in certain systems. The write mask is a four bit code indicating, by the presence of asserted bits in one or more of the four bit positions, the selection of the corresponding eight bit bytes to be written. Thus, the code 1001 indicates that only the first and fourth bytes corresponding to Dj7 0 and Di3l 24 , respectively of a four byte 32 bit word are to be written. The UNLOCK WRITE MASK WITH CACHE INTENT command is used in conjunction with the Interlock Read command to implement indivisible operations such as a readmodify write operation. As may be seen from Fig. 4B, during a WRITE type transaction, parity is generated by the Master during all cycles of the transaction. It is checked by all devices during the Command Address and ImbeddedArbitration cycle and by the Slave during the data cycles. Invalidate Transaction The Invalidate transaction is used by systems having cache memories associated therewith. It is issued by devices under certain conditions to guarantee that obsolete data that may be present in the caches of other devices is not used. In theCommand Address cycle of this transaction, as shown inFig. 4C, the Current aster asserts the Invalidate conmand on information lines I 3 0 and the starting address of the data to be invalidated on data lines Dl29 0 . The number of consecutive locations of cached memory to be invalidated is indicated by the data length code on lines Dl31 30 . The Conm,and Address cycle is followed by the usual Imbedded Arbitration cycle, and a data cycle during which no information is transmitted. As with other multi responder commands, the specified permissible responses are ACK and ND ACK Interrupt and Identify Transactions An Interrupt transaction is illustrated in Fig.4D. The purpose of the transaction is to notify other devices typically, processors of the need to interrupt current activities in order to take other action. The interrupted device responds with an IDENT command to solicit the Interrupt Vector. This vector serves as a pointer to the address of an interrupt routine stored in memory which will establish the required action. The Interrupt transaction comprises aCommand Address cycle, an Imbedded Arbitration cycle, and a data cycle in which no information is transmitted. During the Command Address cycle, theInterrupt command code is asserted on the Information lines it3 0 by the device seeking to interrupt.During this cycle, the interrupting device also asserts one or more interrupt priority levels on data lines Do19 16 to identify the immediacy of requested services. The interrupting device also places an interrupt destination mask on data lines D 15 0 . This mask specifies the devices to which the interrupt is directed. All devices on the co munications path receive this mask. If any asserted bit in the mask corresponds to the device s decoded ID, then the device is selected. This device will later respond with an Identify transaction. Devices which have been selected by the interrupt respond by transmitting an ACK signal two cycles after the zommand Address cycle. As with all other sulti responder commands, A2 and NOACK are the only permissible responses. Devices selected during an interrupt may be expected to engage in a subsequent transaction with the interrupt requesting device in order to complete the interrupt process. Accordingly, each responding device maintains a record for each interrupt level to indicate whether an interrupt was received at the corresponding level. Typically, the record comprises a flag bit in a flip flop hereinafter referred to as an Interrupt Pending Flip Flop . Each bit remains set until the corresponding interrupt has been serviced. The second and third cycles comprise the usualImbedded Arbitration cycle as previously described, as well as a data cycle in which no further information is transmitted. Confirmation is made by one of the confirmation codes permissible for multi responder commands, ACK or NO ACK. Fig. 4E illustrates an Identify transaction.Tnis transaction takes place in response to anInterrupt transaction. During the Cont iand Address cycle, the Current Master asserts the Identify command code on Information lines 1 3 0 and asserts on data lines D119 16 a code corresponding to one or more interrupt levels to be serviced. It also asserts BSY and deasserts NO ARB. The following cycle is the usual Imbedded Arbitration cycle. In the next cycle, the Current Master reasserts its ID nunber, this time in decoded for on data linesD 31 16 . Each device that requires service at an interrupt level specified in the ComWmand Address cycle compares the decoded Master ID with the interrupt destination mask that it had earlier transmitted in order to determine whether it is one of the devices to which the Identify command is directed. If it determines that it is, it manifests its status as aPotential Slave participating in the InterruptArbitration cycle. During both the Decoded Master and the Interrupt Arbitration cycles, the interruptingSlaves also assert BSY and ND ARB.During the Interrupt Arbitration cycle, the devices arbitrating to transmit their interrupt vector assert their decoded ID number on tse appropriate one of the data lines Dj3l 16 . Arbitration takes place in the manner previously described, that is, the device having the highest priority lowest ID number winos the arbitration, thereby becoming the Slave. The Slave then asserts its interrupt vector on the data lines.This vector points to a location in memory which contains a further vector identifying the start of the interrupt service routine. At the same time, theSlave transmits a vector status code on information lines I13 0 indicating the status of the vector in much the same manner as the data status indicated the status of the read data on these lines during a Read transaction. As was the case with previously described transactions, the BSY signal is asserted by the Master during the transaction from the first cycle to the last expected cycle, while ND ARB is asserted from theImbedded Arbitration cycle to the last expected cycle. ACK, NO ACK, STALL and RETRY may be asserted by the Slave in response to the Identify command. This response occurs in cycle five, which is two cycles later than for all other transaction types. During the two cycles following the vector cycle, the Master asserts the ACK confirmation code to indicate successful completion of the transaction, On receipt of the Slave s acknowledgement of the Identify command, the Master resets the Interrupt Pending flip flop corresponding to the interrupt level for which the interrupt vector was transmitted. If the Slave does not receive the Master s acknowledgement to its transmission of the Interrupt Vector, it retransmits the Interrupt transaction. A device may not participate in the interrupt arbitration cycle if it has detected a parity error in either the Command Address or the Decoded Master ID cycles. Devices which have arbitrated during theInterrupt Arbitration cycle but which have lost the arbitration are required to reissue the InterruptCommand. This prevents loss of previously posted interrupts. Interprocessor Interrupt Transaction A simplified fo m of interrupt is provided for multiprocessor systems when one processor seeks to interrupt one or nore other processors. The Interprocessor Interrupt transaction, illustrated inFi . 4F, comprises a Comand Address cycle, an Imbedded Arbitration cycle, and a data cycle in which no information is transmitted. In the particular implementation used to illustrate the intercommunicating means herein, this transaction makes use of three registers, namely, Interprocessor Interrupt Mask, Destination, and Source Registers 212, 214, and 216 respectively Fig. 7A .The task Register contains a field thal identifies the processors from which Interprocessor Interrupt commands will be accepted. The Destination register contains a field that identifies the processors to which an Interprocessor Interrupt Command is to be directed the Source Register contains a field that identifies the source of Interprocessor Interrupt transaction received by a processor. During the Command Address cycle, the interrupting processor asserts the interprocessor interrupt command code on the information lines 113 0 . At the same time, it asserts its decoded .aster ID on tne data lines D 31 16 and asserts a destination code e.g., from its InterprocessorInterrupt Destination Register on data lines D 15 0 . During the following Imbedded Arbitration cycle, the interrupting processor asserts its ID on theInformation lines 1 3 0 , and arbitration proceeds in the usual manner. During the third cycle, the devices addressed by the Destination Code asserted in the Command Address cycle compare the decoded Master ID with the mask in the ask Register to determine whether the Master is a device to which they may respond. If so, in addition, the Decoded Master ID is preferably stored in theInterprocessor Interrupt Source register in order to maintain the identity of interrupting devices. This saves the processor the overhead of later seeking anInterrupt Vector as is done in the Interrupt transaction. The permissible Slave confirmation signals are ACK and ND ACK as for any other multi responjer command. Stop Transaction The Stop transaction is illustrated in Fig. 4G.It facilitates diagnosis of failed systems by stopping further generation of transactions by selected devices while allowing them to continue responding as Slaves.Devices selected by a Stop Transaction must abort anyPending Master state and deassert NO ARB. In order to facilitate error diagnosis, it is preferred that such devices maintain at least certain minimum information concerning error conditions existing at the time of the Stop Transaction. For example, it is desirable that the information contained in Communications PathError Register 204 Fig. 7D be maintained for subsequent analysis. During the Command Address cycle, the CurrentMaster performing a Stop transaction asserts the appropriate command on information lines 113 0 and asserts a destination mask on data lines D 31 0 . The mask comprises a number of bits which, when set, identify the devices which are to be stopped, TheCommand Address cycle is followed by the usualImbedded Arbitration cycle and a data cycle during which no inforamtion is transmitted. The information transmitted during the Command hddress cycle is confirmed two cycles later by all devices selected by the Stop transaction. Broadcast Transaction The Broadcast transaction, illustrated in Fig. 4H, offers a convenient means of broadly notifying devices on the communications path of significant events while avoiding the overhead costs of Interrupt transactions. During the Command Address cycle of the transaction, the Current Master initiating theBroadcast transaction asserts the appropriate command code on Information lines 113 0 and places a two bit data length code on data lines D 31 30 . At the same time, it places a destination mask on data lies D115 Oj. This mask specifies the devices which are selected by the broadcast transaction.For example, a one bit asserted on data lines 2, 3, 5, 9, 12, 13, and 14 will select devices 2, 3, 5, 9, 12, 13, and 14 for receipt of the Broadcast. the Command Address cycle is followed by the usual Imbedded Arbitration cycle which in turn is followed by one or more data cycles. For purposes of illustration only, two data cycles are shown. The data itself is asserted on data lines D 31 0 by the Master. As with hrite type transactions, the Slaves issue either ACK or NO ACK two cycles later. Register Complement Fig. 7A shows the register file contained in the present implementation of the interconnecting means.These comprise a Device Type Register 200, a Control and Status Register 202, a Bus Error Register 204, anError Interrupt Control Register 206, an Error VectorRegister 208, an Interrupt Destination Register 210, an Interprocessor Interrupt Mask Register 212, anInterprocessor Interrupt Destination Register 214 and an Interprocessor Interrupt Source Register 216.These registers comprise both 32 bit registers e.g., registers 200, 204 and 16 bit registers e.g., registers 202, 206, 208, 210, 212, 214 and 216. In the Device Type Register 200, Fig. 7B , the code for the device type is stored in the lower half DTR 1S O of the register. The device type is loaded into this register on system power up or on subsequent initialization of the system. This register may be interrogated by other elements in the system, usually a processor, to determine what devices are connected to the system for purposes of optimizing and dynamically rearranging, the system configuration. A Revision Code field DTR131 16 is provided for in the upper half of the Device Type register. The Control and Status Register 202 contains a number of bits indicating the status of various conditions within the device, as well as within the interconnecting means to which it is attached.Additionally, it stores information utilized in arbitrating for control of the communications path.Thus, bits CSR 3 0 store the encoded form of the device ID which also is loaded into this register on power up or on subsequent initialization. Bits CSR 5 4 specify the arbitration mode in which the device will arbitrate. As described earlier, these modes comprise Dual Round Robin ,Fixed High, Fixed Low, and Arbitration Disabled modes.On power up or on subsequent Initialization, the arbitration mode is set to dual round robin. However, this mode may be changed by writing to these bits during system operation. CSR173 and CSR16 are Hard Error Interrupt Enable and Soft Error r terrupt Enable bits, respectively.When set, they enable the device to generate anInterrupt transaction referred to hereafter as anError Interrupt transaction whenever the Hard ErrorSummary Bit CSR 15 or Soft Error Summary bit CSRjl4 , respectively, are set. These latter bits are set when a hard or a soft error, respectively, is detected. A hard error is one which affects the integrity of data on this system for example, a parity error detected on the data lines during transmission of data is a hard error.Conversely, a soft error is one which does not affect the integrity of the data in the systems for example, a parity error detected on the Identification It3 03 lines during the Imbedded Arbitration cycle nay lead to an incorrect calculation by a device but will not affect the integrity of data on the cornmuncations path. Accordingly, it is a soft error. The Unlock Write Pending bit CSRIB indicates that an Interlock Read transaction has been successfully transmitted by the device but that a subsequent Unlock Write Mask with Cache Intent command has not yet been transmitted. Start Self Test bit CSR l0 , when set, initiates a self test which checks out the operation of the interconnect logic. The SelfTest status CSR ll remains reset until the self test has been successfully completed, at which time the STS bit is set to indicate successful completion of the test. The Broke bit CSR112 is also set if the device has failed its self test. The Initialization bit CSR1131 is used in conjunction with system initialization. For example, it may be used as a status indicator while the device is undergoing Initialization. CSRj23 16 specifies the particular design of the interconnecting means.Bits CSRj3l 24 are presently not used. The Bus Error Register 204 records various error conditions during system operation. The Null ParityError bit BERjO , the Corrected Read Data Bit BER 1 and the ID Parity Error Bit BEBt2 records soft errors, while the remaining bits record hard errors,The Null Parity Error Bit is set if incorrect parity was detected during the second cycle of a two cycle sequence during which NO ARB and BSY were deasserted,The Corrected Read Data bit is set if a Corrected ReadData Status Code is received in response to a Read type transaction. The ID parity error bit is set if a parity error is detected on the It3 01 lines carrying the encoded Master ID during an Imbedded Arbitration cycle. Illegal Confirmation Error bit BER1163 indicates receipt of an illegal confirmation code during a transaction. Nonexistent Address bit BERIl7 is set on receipt of a NO ACK response to a read type or write type command. Bus timeout bit BERtl8 is set if a Pending Master ever waits more than a predetermined number of cycles to assume control of the interconnect. In the specific implementation described herein, a timeout of 4096 cycles is implemented. STALL timeout bit BER l9 is set if a responding Slave device asserts STALL on the response lines CNF 2 0 for more than a predetermined number of cycles. In the present implementation, the stall timeout occurs after 128 cycles.The RETRY timeout bit BER 20 is set if a Current Master receives a predetermined number of consecutive RETRY responses from a Slave with which it is communicating. In the present implementation, this timeout is set for 128 consecuetive RETRY responses. The Read Data Substitute Bit BER 21 is set if a data status comprising a Read Data Substitute or aReserved Status Code is received during a Read type orIdentify transaction and there has been no parity error during this cycle. The Slave Parity Error bit BERl22j is set when a Slave detects a parity error on the conmunication path during a data cycle of a Write type or Broadcast transaction. The Command ParityError bit BER 23 is set when a parity error is detected during a Co r and Address cycle. The Identify Vector error bit BER 24 is set by a Slave on receipt of any confirmation code other thanACK from the Master Identify transaction. TheTransmitter During Fault bit BER 25 is set if device was asserting information on the data and infortion lines or, during Imbedded Arbitration, just on the information lines during a cycle resulting in the setting of the SPE, MPE, CPE, or IPE bit. The Interlock Sequence Error Bit BERl26 is set if a Master successfully transmitted a Write Unlock transaction without having previously transmitted the corresponding Interlock Read transaction. The Master Parity Error bit BER127i is set if the Master detects a parity error during a data cycle having an ACK confirmation on the CNF 2 0 lines.The ControlTransmit Error bit BERi28 is set when a device detects a deasserted state on the NO ARB, BSY, or CNF lines at a time when the device is attempting to assert these lines. Finally, the Master TransmitCheck Error bit BER 29 is set when the data that theMaster is attempting to assert on the Data,Information or Parity lines fails to match the data actually present on these lines. However, the assertion of the Master ID during an ImbeddedArbitration is not checked. Turning now to Fig. 7E, the structure of theError Interrupt Control Register 206 is shown in detail. When a bit is set in the Bus Error Register, and the appropriate Error Interrupt Enable bit is set in the Control and Status Register, or when the force bit is set in the Error Interrupt Control Register, anError Interrupt will occur. Bits EICR113 2 contain the Error Interrupt Vector. If the Force bit EICR120 is set, the interconnecting means will generate anError Interrupt transaction at the levels specified by bits EICRtl9 16 . The Sent bit EICRI21 is set after an Error Interrupt has been transmitted. When set, it prevents the generation of further interrupts by this register. This bit is reset on losing an InterruptArbitration for the Error Interrupt. The InterruptComplete Bit EICR123 is set on successful transmission of the Error Interrupt Vector. The Interrupt Abort bit EICR 24 is set if anError Interrupt transaction is not successful. Turning now to Fig. 7F, the Interrupt DestinationRegister 210 contains an interrupt destination field IDR 15 0 which identifies which devices are to be selected by interrupt commands originated by this device, as previously described. The Interprocessor Interrupt Mask Register 212 is shown in Fig. 7G. This register contains a Mask Field IIMRt3l 16 which identifies devices from which interprocessor interrupts will be accepted.Similarly, the interprocessor interrupt destination register 214 contains a destination field IIDR115 0 which identifies devices to which interprocessor interrupt commands are to be directed. Finally, theInterprocessor Interrupt Source Register 216 contains a source identification field IISR131 16 , which stores the decoded It of a device sending an interprocessor interrupt command to this device provided the ID of the sending device matches a bit in the Interprocessor Interrupt Mask Register of this device.2. Further Specific Description of the InterruptOperation The operation of the interrupt process and, more particularly, the interaction of the Interrupt andIdentify transactions, will be more fully understood on reference to Fig. 8A which shows a number of devices 300, 302 which seek to interrupt one or more other devices, 304 306. For purposes of illustration, there are shown only two interrupting devices, as well as only two devices to which the interrupts are directed. However, it will be understood that there may be as many devices interrupting, and as many devices to which interrupts are directed, as there are devices connected to the communications path.Further, any one device may direct interrupt transactions to any number of devices at the same time conversely, a device may have pending, at any given time, interrupts posted from a number of other devices at the same level or at different levels. Thus, in Fig. 8A, a device 300, which has obtained control of the communications path by arbitrating for control of it as previously described, is shown as transmitting an interrupt transaction over the communications path 82. Although this transaction is received by all devices connected to the communications path, it is directed specifically to those devices identified by the specific bit pattern in the Destination Mask which is transmitted by the interrupting device during the Interrupt transaction.For purposes of illustration, two devices are shown as targeted by the Destination Mask of the device 300, namely, devices 304 and 306. sirnilarly, the device 302, when it obtains control of the comunications path 82 after arbitrating for control, performs anInterrupt transaction which is communicated to all devices on the communications path, but which is specifically targeted to the particular device identified by the bit pattern in its Destination Mask in the present case, the targeted device is shown as device 306. In addition, both devices 300 and 302 transmit, during their Interrupt transaction, information concerning the level or levels the interrupt request levels at which they seek to interrupt. For this example, we will assume the levels transmitted by each device 300, 302 are the same. Focusing now on the targeted devices, devices 304 and 306, on receiving interrupt requests, post the level of these requests in Interrupt Pending registers or flip flops 308 and 310, respectively. In the specific implementation described herein, these registers contain a single bit for each interrupt level. The bit is set on receipt of a request for interrupt at the appropriate level, and is reset when the interrupt is served by the associated device or when service by that device is attempted but it has been determined that service is no longer required e.g., the requested interrupt may have been serviced by another device prior to the time that this device has been able to reach it for service . On receiving an interrupt, each targeted device compares as indicated by the comparison symbol the received destination mask with its own ID. If any bit in the destination mask compares with its own ID, it will transmit an ACK response and set the one or more interrupt pending flip flops at the indicated levels. At a later time, if the level at which a device may service interrupts matches one of the levels set in the interrupt pending flip flops, the previously targeted device will respond to the interrupt by arbitrating for control of the communication path 76 by performing an Identity transaction. Assuming that device 306 is the first of the twD device 304, 306 to obtain control of the communications path, i t performs an Identify transaction which is communicated to all devices on the path. As part of this transaction, the device 306 transmits its own ID, as well as its Identify priority accept level. Devices on the path compare the received interrupt accept level with any interrupt request active and not yet serviced. Additionally, they compare their previously transmitted interruptDestination Mask with the received Master ID. On finding a match with respect to both of these, the device requesting the interrupt prepares to transmit its interrupt vector which identifies the location in storage of the interrupt routine.In Fig. BA, both devices 300 and 302 are shown as having earlier transmitted requests for an interrupt to device 306.Accordingly, both of these devices will respond to theIdentify transaction initiated by device 306 by arbitrating, during a cycle of the Identify transaction i.e., during interrupt vector transmission arbitration cycle , for the right to transmit its interrupt vector. The device having the highest priority here assumed to be device 300 will win the arbitration and thus can transmit itsInterrupt Vector during a following data cycle. The device which loses the interrupt here, assumed to be device 302 will reissue the Interrupt command. The device 306 completes the Identify transaction by issuing the two ACK confirmation responses on receipt of the Vector and Status information from the device which won the Vector transmission arbitration.At a later time, device 304 may arbitrate for. control of the communications path to do a further Identify command. Since device 300 has already been serviced by device 306, a NO ACK will be the command confirmation to the Identify transaction. Device 304 can assume by the NO ACK that device 300 needs no further attention and thereby continues processing. The Interprocessor Interrupt transaction differs from that illustrated in Fig. 8A in that the Identify transaction is not used in connection with it.Instead, the processor requesting an interrupt transmits its ID as part of the Interprocessor Interrupt transaction itself, and this ID may serve as a pointer to the interrupt requesting device s which is stored in the receiving device for each processor from which an Interrupt may be directed to that device. In addition, the targeted device may assume a single level of interrupt priority for all IP Interrupts which is also stored. In a manner similar to non processor to processor interrupts, a processor may direct an Interprocessor Interrupt transaction to any other processor connected to the communications path, and may be the subject of an Interprocessor Interrupt request by any other processor on the path. Thus, referring to Fig. 8B, processors 320 and 322 are shown as having performed an interprocessor interrupt request in which the respective processors transmit their ID and their Destination Mask over the communications path 78. All devices connected to the communications path receive the IP Interrupt request, including a processor 324 which is the target of the IP Interrupt request by processor 320 as determined by the Destination Mssk of that processor, as well as a processor 326 which is the target of an interrupt request fro both processor 320 and processor 322, as determined by the Destination Flasks of the respective processors 320, 324.Each of the processors contain a number of storage locations registers for storing certain information concerning interrupts. For purposes of illustration only, these registers are shown in detail only with respect to processor 326, and include the Interprocessor Interrupt ask register 212, the Interprocessor Destination register 214 and the Interprocessor Interrupt Source register 216 seeFig. 7A . Also stored internally within each processor is a register set 340 which stores level information as well as information concerning the interrupt vector of each processor on the communications path. When a processor, such as processors 320 or 322, initiates an Interprocessor Interrupt transaction, each other processor on the communications path compares its own ID bit with the Destination Mask transmitted by the interrupt requesting processor.The processor finding a match thereby determines that it is the target of the interrupt request. As part of this process, it determines which of the interrupts awaiting service is to be serviced first. This may be accomplished in any of a number of diffeent ways well known to those skilled in the art and which form no part of the present invention. Accordingly, the service process will not be described in detail herein. Further, the targeted processor compares the contents of its Interprocessor Interrupt Mask Register 212 with the received ID. On finding a match, the targeted processor thereby determines that the interrupt requesting processor is one which is authorized to interrupt it.If both of these matches occur, the processor stores the ID of the interrupt requesting processor in its Interprocessor InterruptSource Register 216 and responds by transmitting anACK confirmation as a slave it may then later proceed with service of the IP Interrupt request. When this service is ultimately performed, the responding device, e.g., device 326, utilizes the internal register set 340 to determine the level at which an interrupt requesting device will be serviced, as well as to retrieve the interrupt vector for that device.Devices 320 and 322 are therefore not involved further in transmitting this information. The interrupt mechanism described herein provides numerous significant advantages. To begin with, it allows a device to seek interrupt servicing from a number of other devices, and to accept service from the first device which is available. Further, it allows an interrupt request to be made at one or more levels at the same time. These capabilities greatly enhance operation efficiency and flexibility.Further, the invention obviates the use of a central interrupt arbiter which is characteristic of many systems, and also eliminates the use of additional daisy chain grant and request lines which commonly are used in the prior art for interrupt servicing and which require continuity cards to replace a removed device. Thus, economic implementation of the interrupt function is facilitated, and the possibility of including interrupt operations in a single integrated circuit devoted to communications path is enhanced. Further, location dependence in the interrupt process is eliminated, and thus flexibility in system configuration and dynamic reconfiguration is provided. In addition to these benefits, the InterprocessorInterrupt facility further provides a number of unique advantages. Thus, it can be used to efficiently communicate to other processors on the counications path events of system wide significance without thesignificant overhead commonly associated with interrupt. Further, it can be used to communicate interrupts of low priority but frequent occurrence.Thus processor time is conserved. In addition, unlike non processor to processor interrupts, IP Interrupts allow a broadcast request for multiple processors to service the one interrupting processor. Conclusion From the foregoing it will be seen that we have provided a particularly useful interrupt mechanism for multiprocessor systems. The mechanism is of message oriented for and allows an interrupt at one or more of a plurality of interrupt levels and directed to one or more of a plurality of interrupt handling devices. The interrupt requires no special lines for its implemention beyond those provided for controlling other aspects of communications among devices. The interrupt operation is location independent, and thus a digital computer system utilizing the interrupt mechanism described herein may readily be reconfigured without disturbing the interrupt mechanism.
