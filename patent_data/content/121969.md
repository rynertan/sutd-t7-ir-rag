# LITHOGRAPHY SYSTEM

## Abstract
A lithography system for X ray or other beam printing on a substrate such as a silicon semiconductor wafer com prises a beam chamber 301 , a beam source 302 , means 309 for mounting a mask, means 308 for mounting an image sensing means 342 interiorly of the chamber, means 317, 318 , for mounting a substrate 307 in multiple including six degrees of freedom and means 308, 292, 320 322 including the image sensing means to align the mask and substrate relative to one another utilizing align ment patterns on the mask and substrate, images of which are brought into registration and sensed by the image sens ing means. In a preferred embodiment three sets of target images are provided so as to adjust the substrate and mask relative orientation in six degrees of freedom. The mask seals helium within the chamber. The mask and the sub strate are aligned in situ in the same position in which the mask and substrate are to be exposed to the beam. Means 313, 314, 311, 312 are provided for loading masks, calibra tion assemblies and substrate holding means. The source to substrate distance is adjustable as is the mask to sub strate gap. To conserve helium volume adjustable optic ob jectives 342 are provided in the chamber to sense registra tion of alignment targets on each of the mask and substrate, with essentially the remainder of the optics outside the in chamber. Improved compression optics 408 are also pro vided in the alignment system.
