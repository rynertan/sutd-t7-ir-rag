# WRIST MECHANISM FOR INDUSTRIAL ROBOT.

## Abstract
A wrist mechanism for an industrial robot includes an industrial robot wrist 30 provided at the free end of a robot arm 20 and which has two degrees of freedom, i.e., an oscillating motion and a swivel motion about two substan tially orthogonal axes. The robot wrist 30 is adapted to effect a 90 change in motion direction by a bevel gear mechanism 96 provided in either one of two mechanisms 80, 82, 90, 92, 96 for transmitting the oscillating motion and the swivel motion, respectively, and means 110a, 110b, 120a, 120b for detecting any overtravel in both the motions, and means 112a, 112b, 122a, 122b for detecting the home positions of both the motions are coaxially disposed on one of the two orthogonal axes.
