# A DEVICE FOR LOCATING A SUBMERGED SUBMARINE

## Abstract
A device for locating a submerged submarine includes a magnetic device supplying a magnetic field for adherence of the device against the external structure of a submarine, the magne tic device comprising at least two magnets 2, 3 located adjacent to each other and having co acting magnetic fields, and a magnetically operated switching means 4 within the magnetic field provided by the magnets, the switching means being respon sive to a change in the magnetic field due to the introduction of a metal mass into the field to actuate a source 11 of an acoustic signal.
