## Description
TITLE N Pyridothienopyrazol amide Antirhinoviral Agents BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention is directed to a class of novel compounds and to the use of those compounds for the treatment of diseases in mammals caused by rhinoviruses. Unlike many other infectious agents, viruses are intracellular parasites, the functions of which necessarily involve the metabolic processes of the invaded cell. For this reason, agents that inhibit or kill viruses are likely to cause injury to the host cell as well. Thus, the development of effective antiviral agents presents even more difficulty than the search for drugs to combat diseases caused by other microorganisms. Over the course of many years, thousands of compounds have been evaluated in the search for effective agents. Very few compounds ever reach the stage of clinical testing and of these only a small number have been developed commercially. One of the best known of these agents is l aminoadamantane hydrochloride, which has been found to be effective for the prophylaxis and symptomatic treatment of illness caused by influenza A virus strains. Idoxuridine and adenine arabinoside are effective for the topical treatment of herpes simplex keratitis. Methisazone has been found to be effective for the prevention of smallpox however, it. is not widely used because of the virtually complete elimination of smallpox through innoculation with vaccines. There is clearly a great need in this day and age for a compound that will be effective against rhinoviruses the causative agents of most common colds. This need is of critical importance to the elderly and chronically ill for whom rhinovirus infections can often be dangerous. Moreover, the absenteeism and reduced ability to perform effectively, occasioned by the common cold in humans, represent an astronomical waste of resources.Thus, the need of modern society for an agent which is effective against rhinoviruses is of primary importance. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention is, therefore, directed to a novel class of N pyridothienopyrazol amides which are intended for use in the treatment or prevention of the common cold , an upper respiratory disease of man characterized by rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sneezing, pharyngeal discomfort, and cough1 More particularly, these novel compounds are antirhinoviral agents, inhibiting the multiplication of rhinoviruses, the causative agents of most colds. In contrast to drugs used for symptomatic relief of colds, these compounds inhibit the production of the infectious agent, i.e., one or more of the over one hundred known strains of rhinovirus.Many of these compounds are also active against certain other picornaviruses. In particular, the invention is directed to compounds corresponding to the formula Ivan, A.S., Ed., Viral Infections of Humans, Plenum Publishing Co., New York, N.Y. 1976 pp. 383 408. EMI3.1 whereinR1 is methyl or ethyl R2 is selected from cyclohexyl, benzyl, 3 pyridyl, 1 adamantyl, C25 haloalkyl having 1 3 halogen substit uents in other than the a position with respect to the carbonyl group, and the groups EMI3.2 wherein X is H, F, C1 R3 and R4 are independently selected from H and C13 alkyl and is is selected from H and C15 alkyl and their pharmaceutically suitable acid addition salts, such as hydrochloride or sulfate. The invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions containing the above described compounds and to the method of using them for the prophylaxis and therapy of diseases caused by rhinoviruses in mammals. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Within the context of the above formula, it has been found that certain structural variations are preferred because of the indication of greater antiviral effectiveness. In particular, it is preferred that R1 be nethyl and or that R2 be selected from the group onsisting of 3 pyridyl, chloroalkyl, and a groupEMI3.3 in which R3 and R4 are independently C13 alkyl and R5 is H or C1 5 alkyl. Still further preferred are those compounds in which R2 isEMI4.1 and the R groups are selected from one of the following R3, R4 and R5 are each methyl R3 is H, R4 is ethyl, and R5 is butyl R3, R4 and R5 are each ethyl or R3 and R4 are ethyl and R5 is H.The most preferred compounds are 2, 2 diethyl N l methyl lH pyrazolo 3 ,4 4,5 thieno 2,3 b pyridin 3 yl butanamide and 2 ethyl N l methyl lH pyrazolo 3 ,4 4 ,S thieno 2,3 b pyridin 3 ylihexanamide. Synthesis The compounds of this invention are made by the following sequence of reactions SCHEME 1EMI4.2 EMI5.1 In the foregoing reaction sequence, Scheme I, Ra is a lower C1 4 alkyl group which is preferably methyl or ethyl and MOH is an aqueous alkali metal hydroxide which is preferably potassium hydroxide. Reaction 1 is both a diazotiation and diazo salt decomposition reaction which, because of its highly exothermic nature, is preferably carried out at low temperatures with agitation. Preferred temperatures are 0 10 C. However, it will be recognized that the reaction could be carried out at higher temperatures by introducing the reactant at a slower rate in order for the exotherm to become dissipated. In reaction 1 , other nitrites may be used to effect diazotization. This reaction step is of particular interest, however,. from the standpoint that, by analogy with similar aromatic amines, it would be expected to produce the corresponding hydroxyl compound, not the bromine substituted material.The starting material for Reaction 1 , I, is described in J. Het. Chem., 11, 975 1974 Reaction 2 is a hydrolysis reaction, which can be carried out with either antacid or, as illustrated above, with a base. Preferred bases includeNaOH and KOH of which the latter is especially preferred. The hydrolyzed product of Reaction C2 is then converted to 3 bromothieno 2, 3 b pyridine 2 carboxamide. In the route shown above, the acid is converted to an acid halide Reaction 31, which in turn is converted to the corresponding carboxamide by ammonalysis Reaction 4 .The intermediate carboxylic acid halides can be prepared by reaction of the carboxylic acid with inorganic halides such as thionyl chloride or alternatively by reaction of the carboxylic acid or alkali metal salt with oxalyl chloride or bromide. Mixed anhydrides of the carboxylic acid can be prepared with alkyl chloroformates, and subsequently converted to the amide. Alternatively, ethyl 3 bromothieno 2,3 b pyridine 2 carboxylate could be transformed directly to the corresponding carboxamide by ammonolysis, as follows EMI6.1 Reaction 15 is a dehydration step by which 3 bromothieno 2,3 b pyridine 2 carboxe.mide is converted to the corresponding carbonitrile. A preferred reagent for this purpose is POCi3. Alternatively, the carboxylic acid can be reacted with chlorosulfonyl isocyanate to form the carbonitrile directly as follows EMI6.2 In Reaction .6 , the above described 2 carbonitrile compound VI is reacted with methylPor ethylhydrazine in solution to form l methyl or l ethyl lH pyrazolo 3 ,4 4,5 thieno 2,3 b pyridin 3 amine. For suitable reaction rates, it is preferred to carry out this reaction at 50 1000C in an inert organic solvent such as dimethylsulfoxide. In the final step of the process, the 3 aminesubstituted product VII is acylated to convert the amine group to an appropriate amide derivative VIII .The amine can be acylated with carboxylic acid chlorides, hranidRs, anhydrides or esters using any of several standard procedures which are well known in the art. Reaction 7 can be carried out in an inert organic solvent, such as methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran, or dimethylformamide, or without added solvent, using the acylating agent as solvent, such as acetic anhydride the reaction temperature is not critical and can range between 00 and the boiling point of the solvent or reaction mixture. The use of an acid acceptor such as pyridine is preferred when Reaction 7 is carried out with a carboxylic acid halide. SCHEME IIEMI7.1 EMI8.1 In the foregoing reaction sequence Scheme II ,X is a halogen C1,Br or I and Rb is an alkyl group which is ethyl or tert butyl. Reaction 8 is a nucleophilic displacement by thiolate on readily available chloronicotinic acid IX.IX can be alkylated and esterified in one step Reaction 9 by treatment with ICH2CN, ClCH2CN KI or BrCH2CN under basic conditions, preferably KHCO3. Reaction 9 is novel and labar saving in that both the alkylation and esterification of X is carried out in one reaction step.The cyclization step, Reaction 10 , is straight forward, giving the readily isolated potassium oxide XII. Upon heating the potassium oxide XII with PC15 a displacement takes place to give the key intermediate XIII, which readily reacts with the alkylhydrazine to give the amineVII in high yield. With Reaction 12 Schemes I and II converge, and the acylation of VII is carried out according to Reaction 7 . Using l methyl or l ethyl lH pyrazolo 3 ,4 4,5 thieno 2,3 b pyridin 3 amine and the appropriate acylating agent, the compounds listed below can be prepared by the procedures of Examples 1, 2 and or 3 herein below N 1 methyl 1H pyrazolo 3 ,4 4,5 thieno 2,3 b pyridin 3 yl cyclohexanecarboxamide N l ethyl lH pyrazolo 3 ,4 4,5 thieno 2,3 b pyridin 3 yl benzamide 3 chloro N 1 methyl 1H pyrazolo 3 ,4 4,5 thieno 2,3 b pyridin 3 yl propionamide N l ethyl lH pyrazolo 3 ,4 4,3 thieno 2,3 b pyridin 3 yl 6,6, 6 trifluorohexanamide 3,3 dichloro 2,3 dimethyl N l methyl lH pyrazolo 3 ,4 4,5 thieno 2,3 b pyridin 3 yl propionamideN 1 ethyl 1H pyrazolo 3 ,4 4,5 thieno 2,3 b pyridin 3 yl hexanamide 2 ethyl N 1 methyl 1H pyrazolo 3 ,4 4,5 thieno 2,3 b pyridin 3 yllbutanamide 3, 3 dimethyl N l methyl lH pyrazolo 3 ,4 4,5 thieno 2,3 b pyridin 3 yl propionamide 2, 2 dimethyl N 1 ethyl lH pyrazolo 3 , 4 4,5 thieno 2,3 b pyridin 3 yl valeramide 2 ethyl 2 methyl N 1 methyl 1H pyrazolo 3 ,4 4,5 thieno 2,3 b pyridin 3 yl propionamide 2,4 dimethyl 2 ethyl N 1 ethyl 1H pyrazolo 3 ,4 4,5 thieno 2,3 b pyridin 2 yl valeramide 2 ethyl 2 methyl N 1 methyl 1h pyrazolo 3 ,4 4,5 thieno 2,3 b pyridin 3 yl butanamide EXAMPLE 1 2,2 Diethyl N 1 methyl 1H pyrazolo 3 ,4 4,5 thieno 2,3 b pyridin 3 yl butanamide A solution of 14.0 g of sodium nitrite in 50 ml of H2O was added dropwise to a stirred sus pension of 53.9 g of ethyl 3 aminothieno 2,3 b pyridine 2 carboxylate fJ.

An oral dose range, using tablets or capsules, of 2 to 50 mg kg dose with doses given as frequently as every 4 hours or as little as once a day, is the suggested regimen of dosing. Pharmaceutical preparations of sustained release compositions can also be used as oral dosage forms. In using the intranasal route, effective methods include administration by intranasal drops, by nebulizer, or aerosol of useful droplet size. An acceptable range of concentrations is between 0.1 mg ml and 20 mg ml, with a preferred range between 0.1 and 2.0 mg ml. Gaaltney2 has demonstrated that hand contact of nasal mucus may be the most important mode of rhinovirus transmission. Sterilization of the hands of people coming into contact with persons infected with rhinovirus would be a method for preventing further spread of the disease.If this class of N pyridothienopyrazol amides were incorporated into a hand washing or hand care procedure they would inhibit production of rhinovirus and decrease the likelihood of the transmission of the disease.Test Procedures To those skilled in the art, the following procedure will be recognized as similar to the protocol of Fiala3, an established method in the field of virology. Rhinovirus sensitive HeLa cells are grown to confluent monolayers and infected with approximately 100 rhinovirus particles and subsequently covered with an agar containing medium having varying concentra2J. Gwaltney, J.O. Hendley and P. Wenzel, N. Engl. J. Med, 288 1361 1973 . 3Fiala, M., Plaque Formation by 55 Rhinovirus Serotypes, Appl. Microbiol. 16 1445 1968 . tions of the test chemical. After 3 to 4 days of incubation at 340C, the agar is removed and the plates stained with crystal violet. The amount of inhibition is determined by the reduction in the number of plague in the cell layer, the minimum inhibitory composition MIC being that concentration of compound required to completely suppress plaque formation. The compound 2,2 diethyl N l methyl lH pyrazolo 3 ,4 4,5 thieno 2,3 b pyridin 3 yl butanamide Example 1 was micronized to.2 microns or smaller particle size and suspended in distilled water at series dilutions from 50 Vg ml to 0.4 Vg ml. The results obtained from testing against three rhinovirus strains are shown in Table 4. These results show that the test compound was 100 effective at preventing multiplication of rhinovirus at very low concentration. Using similar methodology Examples 2 21 were tested and these results shown in Table 4. These compounds all exhibit potent antiviral activity.

Used orally, the compounds of this invention will have a therapeutic dose range in man from 2.0 to 300 mg kg day. The dosage forms described below are designed to deliver this therapeutic dose. EXAMPLE 22 The following example demonstrates that the class of DJ pyridothienopyrazol amides of this invention would be effective in entering mammalian tissue at the sites of rhinovirus infection and replication. 2,2 Diethyl N l methyl lH pyrazolo 3 ,4 4,5 thieno 2,3 b pyridin 3 yl butanamide Example 1 , after oral administration, appears at the site of rhinovirus infections, the respiratory tissue, in concentrations in excess of those required for antirhinovirus activity. This was demonstrated in an experiment in which five overnight fastedRhesus monkeys Mucaca mullata , each weighing 2.5 3 kg, were administered the compound via gastric intubation of a 1 mg ml aqueous suspension at a dose of 10 mg kg. One animal was sacrificed at each of the following times after dosing 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hours.One additional untreated animal was sacrificed for control tissue. The amount of the compound of Example 1 in the lung tissue at each of these times was determined using a liquid chromatography assay, specific for the unchanged compound. The results in Table 5 show that the level of compound present in the lung tissue, expressed as micrograms of compound per gram of lung, exceeded the in vitro antirhinovirus MIC approximately 0.5 pg ml for at least 2 hours after the compound was administered.
