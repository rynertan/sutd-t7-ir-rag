# Photographic colour elements.

## Abstract
Colour photographic motion picture elements adapted to form a multicolour photographic dye image and an integral, infrared absorbing, dye sound track and comprising 1 hydroxy 2 N 5 alkyl thiazol 2 yl naphthamide couplers that are capable of forming quinone imine dyes absorbing infrared radiation in the spectral range from about 600 to about 1000 nm by reaction with an oxidized aromatic primary amino developing agent, the thiazol 2 yl group of said naphthamide couplers bearing a 4 para C₁ C₄alkoxyphenyl group or a 4 para C₁ C₄alkylphenyl group, the hydrogen atoms of said C₁ C₄alkoxy or C₁ C₄alkyl being unsubstituted or at least one of them having been substitu ted by a halogen atom.
