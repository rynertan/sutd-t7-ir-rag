# Multi component fractionation process.

## Abstract
A fractionation process is provided, wherein heavy product 11 is withdrawn from a first fractionator 10 and introduced into a second fractionator 20 . The withdrawn heavy product is separated into relatively light 21 and heavy fractions 97 , preferably with stripping steam 93 , in the second fractionator 20 . A controlled stream of quench 39 , a bottoms product 31 from a light product stripper 30 , is added to the second fractionator to adjust an end point of overhead products exiting therefrom. Second fractionator overhead product is passed into the stripper. Stripper overhead vapor 41 is preferably introduced into the first fractionator where these overhead vapors are further fractionated.
