# FERROFLUIDIC SEAL APPARATUS AND METHOD OF FORMING SAME

## Abstract
a self activating ferrofluid seal apparatus comprises a permanent magnet ring 12 and a pair of pole pieces 14,16 which forms a cavity therebetween. Magnetically permeable, extending elements 24,26 in the cavity form a ferrofluid retaining gap therebetween with the pole pieces forming a radial gap with the surface of the shaft 28 to be sealed. The ferrofluid retaining gap being a magnetic field intensity to retain the ferrofluid therebetween and sufficiently larger in gap width than the radial gap, whereby, on insertion of the shaft element, the ferrofluid 22 , based on the change in magnetic flux path, will move from the retaining gap to the radial gap to form a ferrofluid seal about the shaft element.
