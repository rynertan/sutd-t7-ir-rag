# Radiation detector.

## Abstract
A detector for the detection of, for example, Cerenkov radiation, comprises an entrance screen 5 which may cover more than half of an envelope 1 the majority of which is preferably spherical. A photo electron detecting exit screen 11 is proportioned and arranged inside the envelope 1 , so that a small decay time and a high sensitivity are achieved. A scintillation exit screen 11 which is mounted on an indentation 15 in the envelope 1 can thus produce, in conjunction with a photomultiplier tube 17 mounted inside the indentation 15 , a photo electric intensification by a factor 100.
