# Hydraulic brake control mechanism.

## Abstract
A hydraulic brake control device has a load sensing component connected through an electric circuit to a motor ized proportioning valve which loads or unloads a resilient member therein to vary the split point of the proportioning valve. The electric circuit has an attitude cutoff switch and a speed cutoff switch which deactuate the electric circuit when the vehicle is pitched or rolled above a predetermined hori zontal attitude and moving faster than a predetermined speed, respectively. The electric circuit can either actuate the motor to load the resilient member within proportioning valve, unload the resilient member within proportioning valve, or render the motor inactive and maintain the propor tioning valve in a status quo condition.
