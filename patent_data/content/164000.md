# A method and system for routing frames in a multi ring local area network.

## Abstract
The architecture provides a frame format and proce dure for routing messages through a single ring or multi ring communication system. Stations associated with the exchange of messages are located on the single ring or on different rings of the multi ring communication system. The rings are connected by bridges to form a physical local area network. The frame format includes a plurality of control bits positioned within a Routing Information RI field, a frame control field and a frame status field. Messages are generated and structured in accordance with the frame for mat. A group of the control bits, in each message, is set with initial values according to the message type. Thus, different messages are characterized by a different sequence of con trol bit settings. A routing algorithm analyzes the message and depending on the status of the control bits, the message is processed and ultimately switched to its proper desti nation.
