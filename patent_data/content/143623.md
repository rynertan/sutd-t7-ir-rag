# AUTOMATIC TEST EQUIPMENT

## Abstract
An automatic test equipment for the functional testing of electrical printed circuit board assemblies is constructed as the combination of a programmable controller based upon a microcomputer and selected interface modules which can be plugged into the controller system backplane in any of a number of module interconnection locations and in any com bination of module types with the controller being adapted to interrogate the modules as to their type and location and organize its routines accordingly. The controller has an ad vantageous bus structure for resource sharing within the equipment, and provides facilities for various forms of in put output modules as well as for analog stimulus response modules, programmable waveform generator modules, sig nature analysis and frequency measurement modules, real time emulation modules, etc., and for the connection of com puter standard utilities such as keyboard, light pen graphics, printer, etc., as well as specialist instrumentation and also a manufacturing defects analyser for in circuit testing.
