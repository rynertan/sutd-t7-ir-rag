# An arrangement for locking the winding device of a vehicle safety belt.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an automatically operating locking arrangement for the winding device of a vehicle safety belt, the winding device including a spindle 4 which is journalled for rotation in two mutually opposite directions and to which there is connected a strap 5 which forms part of the safety belt and which can be wound onto and unwound from the spindle, the spindle being connected to a spring 6 which is tensioned when the strap is unwound from the spindle and which is able to drive the spindle in the opposite direction, for automatically winding up the strap. The locking arrangement 9 according to the invention is arranged to lock the spindle 4 automatically against rotation in the strap unwinding direction, when the vehicle in which the winding device is installed is subjected to acceleration or retardation forces exceeding a given value, for example as a result of collision, heavy braking or the like. The locking arrangement can also be designed to automatically lock the spindle against rotation in the strap unwinding direction, when the strap is unwound at an excessively high acceleration or an excessively high speed.
