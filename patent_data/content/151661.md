# Use of aqueously dispersed compositions as glass fiber sizing agent or for the manufacture of glass fiber sizing agents.

## Abstract
The present invention is directed to an aqueously dispersed, heat curable coating composition comprising a a water dispersible epoxy resin component contain ing external and or chemically incorporated non ionic emul sifiers and b a water dispersible, blocked polyisocyanate compo nent containing chemically incorporated anionic hydrophilic groups in a weight ratio of component a to component b of about 1 10 to 10 1 The present invention is also directed to the use of these compositions for producing coated substrates and especially as glass fibre sizing agent resp. for the manufacture of glass fibre sizing agents.
