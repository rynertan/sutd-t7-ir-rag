# FREQUENCY MODULATION TRANSMITTER

## Abstract
A frequency modulation transmitter has a frequency synthesizer 8 comprised of a voltage controlled oscillator 1 for operating a transmitter section 33 of the modulation transmitter. The output center frequency of the voltage controlled oscillator 1 is determined by channel designation information. The level of a modulation input signal 11 applied to the voltage controlled oscillator 1 for modulating the center frequency is changed in accordance with the channel designation information.
