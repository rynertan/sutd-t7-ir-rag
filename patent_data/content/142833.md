# RADIATION IMAGE READ OUT APPARATUS

## Abstract
In a radiation image read out apparatus for scanning a stimulable phosphor carrying a radiation image stored therein by stimulating rays, and photoelectrically detecting light emitted by the stimulable phosphor by use of a photo detector via a light guide member, the light guide member is fabricated into a hollow tubular shape. The light guide member is positioned in face to face relation to the stimulable phosphor so that the longitudinal direction of the light guide member coincides with the scanning direction of the stimulat ing rays. The photodetector is secured to at least one end face of the light guide member. The light guide member is pro vided with a slit extending longitudinally for passing the stimulating rays therethrough and introducing the light emit ted by the stimulable phosphor into the light guide member.
