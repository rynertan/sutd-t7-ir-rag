## Description
SUPPORTING FITtlENlTS Description In its broadest context, the present invention is concerned with the support of fitments generally. More particularly, but by no means exclusively, the invention is concerned with display systems of the kind in which fitments such as panels are supported from uprights. Many such systems, which may be used for the display of products or information and also for demountable partitioning in open plan office environments, are available on the market. The available systems are commonly based on a square or hexagonal module that is they include uprights, usually formed as extrusions which have slots running therealong spaced about the axis of the upright at 600 or 900 angular separations. The panels or the like are fitted directly into these slots. Based on a hexagonal module, the panels will for an angle between each other of 600 or 1200 degrees. Based on a square module, the panels form an angle of 900 or an angle of 1800 relative to each other. It is frequently not easy to fit the systems together or to adjust them. The present invention seeks, inter alia, to provide a display system which is relatively simple in construction and is readily .djustable to neet the needs of the user. In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided in combination a. fitment and a support therefor, the support comprising an elongate member provided with at least one elongate slot or groove extending therealong and configured for sliding receipt of a root end portion of the fitment inserted the ein, the root end portion of the fitment being shaped to allow pivotal movement of the fitment about the axis of the slot or groove while located therein, and the root end portion of the fitment being provided with locking means adapted for cooperation with the slot or groove for securing the fitment to the support in a position which may be selected both longitudinally and pivotally. The support need not comprise a vertical post. It may for example extend horizontally, or indeed at any angle between horizontal and vertical depending upon the particular requirements. The fitment may comprise virtually anything which it is desired to support. Examples which spring to mind include lighting fitments, receptacles, brackets, shelving, and panels. No doubt other fitments which could usefully be supported in the manner of the present invention will readily occur to the reader. The elongate member may conv eniently be formed as an extrusion of aluminium or its alloys or of pl as tics. The slot or groove may conveniently be formed as a part cylindrical surface, and in that case the root end portion of the fitment may suitably be formed as a cylinder with an integral web or flans to which, for example, a display panel may be coupled by threaded connectors. The pivotal movement of the fitment relative to the support will ten b the nature of a hinge. The locking means suitably comprise means mounted on the root end portion and which can be expanded by application o a tool to wedge the root end portion in the slot.Preferably, the locking means comprise a threaded member with a head dimensioned for reception of an Allen Key. In an alternative arrangement, the root end portion may comprise a ball so that the pivoting of the root end portion in the slot is in the manner of a socket joint. Thus, in a second and alternative aspect of the present invention, there is provided a display system comprising one or more fitments supported from uprights, each upright comprising an extruded section defining one or more elongate slots or grooves, and the one or more fitments having root end portions received in said slots or grooves so as to be longitudinally slidable therein, so as to be moveable therein in the manner of a hinge or of a socket joint, and being selectively lockable therein . The invention is hereinafter more particularly described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows a horizontal section taken through a display system constructed in accor dance with the present invention Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the display system of Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 shows a top plan view of an alternative embodiment of display system also constructed in accordance with the present invention. The display system shown in Figs. 1 and 2 comprises one or more uprights I only one is shown in the drawing consisting of . an e truded hollow section, suitably formed of aluminium, one of its alloys, or of plastics. Tow panels 2 are supported from the upright, and the position and orientation of the panels nz be varied, as will be explained. The upright defines four elongate slots or grooves 3 running therealong. Modified arrangements including a greater or lesser number of slots or grooves 3 could readily be designed. Thedesigned. Thegroove 3 illustrated comprises a part cylindrical surface and the panels 2 are provided with root end portions 4 which consist of a cylindrical hinge member 5 from which extends a web 6 terminating in a flange 7 at right angles thereto. Alternative, but plainly less preferable, arrangements could be devised in which the slot surface does not consist of a part cylindrical surface and the hinge member 5 is not cylindrical.It is essential, however, that the root end portion be shaped to allow pivotal movement of the fitment about the axis of the slot or groove 3. The cylindrical hinge member 5 may be inserted into the groove either at its extreme longitudinal end or at an intermediate portion cut away as indicated by dotted lines in Fig. I at 8. The hinge member 5 is not. a tight fit in the groove. It may be slid axially thereof to position the panel 2 longitudinally and it allows pivotal movement about the axis of the slot or groove 3 to vary the orientation of the panels relative to each other and to the upright Locking means 9 Fig. 2 are provided in the root end portions of the fitments and suitably comprise threaded members extending, for example, along the lines indicated at 10 in Fig.I and adapted to be extended into the slot by turning a headed portion 11 of the locking means, as for example by an Allen Key, so as to wedge the hinge member 5 in the slot. One or more feet 12 a be provided at the bottom of the upright for su orting the same and these may be mounted in the slots 3 in an exactly similar fashion. As will be appreciated fron the above description, the panels 2 of the embodiment of Figs. 1 and 2 can readily be adjusted in position both vertically and pivotally by loosening the locking means, adjusting the panel by hand and re locking.
