# Improvements in belt casters.

## Abstract
In an apparatus for casting metal between a pair of heat conductive belts 21 an array of closely spaced hexagonal headed 50 support members are arranged behind each belt at the mould space. Each support member includes a restricted axial coolant jet passage and a film of coolant is maintained between each head and the adjacent belt, which is pulled against the support heads by maintain ing subatmospheric pressure conditions in the region of the supports. Each support member is slidably mounted in a base and is forced towards the belt by a spring but a stop retains each support when the belt is removed. The close spacing of the hexagonal heads prevent their rotation in rela tion to each other but an individual support can be released by depressing the support head out of the plane of adjacent support heads and rotating the support through 60 to dis engage it from its stop. The support can then be withdrawn axially.
