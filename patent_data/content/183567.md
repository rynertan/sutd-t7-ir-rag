# Process for producing polyphenylene ethers.

## Abstract
Polyphenylene ethers are produced by oxidative polymerization of phenols in the presence of a catalyst comprising divalent manganese salts, an oxine or derivative thereof, an alkanolamine, and an alkaline compound. This catalyst has an increased polymerization activity allows higher productivity to be achieved and enables the polymerization to be conducted at relatively high tempera tures.
