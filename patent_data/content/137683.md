# Prevention of drilling fluid loss in subterranean formations.

## Abstract
A method of drilling a well bore into a subterranean formation containing water having monovalent and polyva lent cations therein, and preventing leaks into the forma tion of an oil base drilling fluid used in the drilling, comprises adding to an oil base fluid comprising an oil, water, a weighting agent and an emulsifying agent, a powdered seepage loss reducer selected from amorphous silicates having a ratio of silicon dioxide to alkali metal oxide in the range of 1.5 1 to 3.3 1, the alkali metal being sodium or potassium ammonium soaps of fatty acids having from 12 to about 22 carbon atoms and mixtures thereof to form the drilling fluid and circulating the drilling fluid containing the powdered seepage loss reducer in the well bore. When the circulation of the drilling fluid containing the seepage loss reducer takes place, the seepage loss reducer reacts with the monovalent and polyvalent cations contained in the forma tion to form a seal in the formation adjacent to the well bore.
