## Description
Heat exchange elements This invention relates to a heat exchange element and more particularly to a plate type heat exchange element of a kind suitable for utilising flue gases from a domestic fire box, oven or the like for heating a liquid. It is known to situate a heat exchange element within a domestic fire box and to use the fire not only for room heating but also to heat water for domestic use or oil for circulation to radiators in other rooms. Heat exchange elements may be broadly classified as of the tubular type or of the plate type. Although the heat exchange art is old and highly developed, it remains difficult to manufacture an element which is of a sufficiently low manufacturing cost, sufficiently high efficiency, and sufficiently compact and robust for installation for example in a domestic flue or chimney. The problem underlying the present invention is to provide an improved plate type heat exchanger element suitable for installation in a flue or chimney which is simpler to construct and or more efficient in use than conventional elements. According to one aspect the invention provides a heat exchange element comprising two plates superimposed one upon the other, one or both of the plates being formed so as to define therebetween a passage extending from a passage inlet to a passage outlet, the plates being welded or sealingly secured to each other at or near the periphery, at least one of the plates having a plurality of ridges which project into the passage way and which extend transverse the direction of flow in the passage. Various embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a general view of an embodiment of the invention mounted in a stove flue. Figure 2 is a schematic plan view of a first embodiment according to the invention. Figure 3 is a schematic cross sectional view of the embodiment of Figure 2 taken on line 3 3. Figure 4 is a cross section of the embodiment ofFigure 2 taken on line 4 4. Figure 5 is a cross section of the embodiment ofFigure 2 taken on line 5 5. Figure 6 shows a second embodiment of the invention in a plan view. Figure 7 shows a third embodiment of the invention in elevation. With reference to the drawings, Figure 1 shows schematically a stove 1 for burning a solid fuel and having a tubular flue 2 of circular cross section extending upwards from the roof 3 of the stove s fire box to exit through a room ceiling not illustrated . A heat exchange element 4 according to the invention is mounted within flue 2 and has a hollow tubular water inlet connection 5 and water outlet connection 6 whereby element 4 is adapted for connection to a convection circulation system including a water reservoir not illustrated . With reference to Figures 2 to 5, one embodiment of element 4 comprises a pair of superimposed stainless steel plates 10, 11 welded each to the other in face to face configuration at a weld seam 12 extending along the perimeter. Plates 10, 11 are pressed prior to union so as to have corresponding channels which in the assembly define a passage 14 and which in the complete element provides a flow path from inlet tube 5 to outlet tube 6. For preference, passage 23 is not a straight flow path but changes direction at points 15, 15A, 16 and 16A to create a degree of turbulence in a liquid flowing from inlet 5 to outlet 6. During the pressing operation plates 10, 11 are each formed with a plurality of ridges 17 in the channel shown in Figure 5 which in the finished element forms part of passage 14 interior. Ridges 17 also cause a degree of turbulence when liquid is flowing in passage 14. Ridges 17 appear as indentations on plates 10, 11 when the element is viewed from the exterior and are preferably of curvilinear plan. Ridges 17 extend transverse the direction of flow in passage 14 and may be step or fin shaped in profile. For preference ridges 17 are crescent shaped indentations and those protruding from plate 10 into passage 14 are staggered with respect to those protruding from plate 11. In the example illustrated, passage 14 has a depth of from 3 to 4 mm and a width of 31 mm. Plates 10, 11 are of 444 stainless steel, seam welded along the perimeter.Ridges 17 extend approximately 2 mm in the depth direction and are spaced apart in the flow direction at intervals of approximately 5 cms. The embodiment shown in Figure 6 is similar to that of Figures 2 to 5 in most respects and parts of corresponding function are identified with corresponding numerals. However, in the embodiment of Figure 6, passage 14 extends in a U shape, plates 10, 11 being welded not only at the peripheral edges 12 but also between the legs of the U shape at 12A. Ridges 17 are not illustrated inFigure 6 but are provided in a manner similar to that shown in the first embodiment. The element of Figure 6 may be provided with mounting tabs if required by extending one or both plates beyond weld seam 12. The embodiment shown in Figure 7 is double walled and comprises an element such as previously described with reference to Figures 2 to 5 together with an encasing jacket wall 20. Inlet tube 5 and outlet tube 6 extend through jacket wall 20. The interior space 22 between jacket wall 20 and the side of plates 10 and 11 external to passage 14 is vented via a port or tube 21 preferably located on the same side of the element as inlet outlet tubes 5, 6. The embodiment shown in Figure 7 has iw B.S.P. ports and jacket 20 may be made of two identical pressings approximately 50 mm wider and longer than the contained heat exchange element. In one construction the edges of the outer shells are seam welded along a protruding 25 mm flange to the edges of the inner element.This construction pulls the steel of the inner element taut. Inlet and outlet pipes 5, 6 are welded to the jacket. The inner element is provided with edge communication orifices not illustrated between seam 12 and jacket wall 20 whereby chamber 22 on the vented side of the inner element 4 communicates with chamber 22 on the opposite side. The outer jacket wall 20 is also optionally provided with a series of small indentations which press against the external surface of element 4 to provide a vent chamber between element 4 and jacket wall 20 while providing thermal conduction between the jacket wall 20 and element 4. This arrangement has the advantage that a much higher working pressure may safely be adopted.Jacket 20 acts as a safety jacket so that in the unlikely event of a leak in element 4, fluid or gas leaked from passage 14 would pass into the vent chamber and then via the vent to a safe area. It will be understood that the heat exchange elements according to the invention may be installed in a fire box itself rather than in the flue although it is preferable to use the waste heat in the flue. Elements according to the invention may be used in industrial heat exchange applications as well as in domestic uses. It is not essential to press form both of plates 10, 11 to form passage 14 and if desired it is sufficient to form a channel in only one plate. Similarly although it is desirable that indentations 17 be provided in both plates 10, 11 it is sufficient that they be provided on one plate. Indentations 17 serve to stiffen the plates enabling lighter gauges to be employed than would otherwise be the case in addition to causing turbulence adjacent plates 10, 11. Heat exchange elements according to the invention are of greater efficiency than copper fin tube heat exchangers having 19 fins per 2.5 cm and of comparable length dimension. It is believed that the small passage depth in relation to width is of importance. The small depth in relation to width and the turbulences caused by the transverse indentations apparently combine to improve heat transfer from element 4 to a fluid passage 14. It is undesirable to reduce the depth of passage 14 to an extent that thermosyphon action is prevented or that pressure drop is unduly increased when liquids are pumped through. The dimensions and materials of construction of items according to the invention may be altered to an extent which will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope hereof.
