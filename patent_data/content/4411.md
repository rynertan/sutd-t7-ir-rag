# Optical device for and method of amplitude modulation of light beam.

## Abstract
An optical modulator suitable for use with a collimated light beam having a moderate cross section and a fast response time and operational at relatively low voltage includes a glass prism 12 and a smooth metal surface 14 that are separated by an adjustable gap 18. The gap is filled with air, having an index of refraction lower than the prism. A beam 22 of monochromatic light is passed into the prism at a specific angle of incidence to undergo total internal reflection at the glass prismgap interface. A change of approximately 1 micron in the thickness of the gap is sufficient to change the reflectivity from greater than 95 to essentially zero. The size of the gap is mechanically adjusted and this mechanical device 20 determines the frequency response of the light modulation.
