# SPINDLE ROTATION CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract
The system has a speed control circuit 103 which can control motor 104 driving spindle 108 so as to make actual speed AV detected by a detector 105 coincide with a com manded speed CV. A position control circuit 112 provides a position devia tion signal RPD which can be applied to speed control circuit 103 in place of commanded speed CV by means of change over switch 111 so that the circuit 103 controls the motor to bring the spindle to rest at the desired stopping position. A proximity switch 110 is used which has a magnetic body 110a on the spindle and a fixed sensing portion 110b. At the desired stopping position 110a and 110b confront one an other. The switch 110 produces an output of zero volts at the desired stopping position and a positive and a negative output when immediately to the left and the right of the desired stop ping position. The signal output of 110 is used to provide posi tion deviation signal RPD.
