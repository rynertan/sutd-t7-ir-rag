# Ternary alloy coated steel wire.

## Abstract
This invention reveals a steel wire element useful in the reinforcement of rubber articles in which the steel wire is provided with an adhesive coating comprising a ternary brass alloy containing about 55 percent to about 75 percent by weight copper, about 15 to about 45 percent by weight zinc, and about 0.1 to about 10 percent by weight iron. Preferably this ternary brass alloy will contain about 1 to 5 percent by weight iron. The steel wire elements of this invention are useful in the reinforcement of vehicle tires, power transmis sion belts, conveyor belts, hoses, and the like.
