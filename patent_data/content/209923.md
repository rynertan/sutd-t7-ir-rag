# Arrangement for identifying peripheral apparatuses which may be connected at geographically different locations to a communication network by means of local coupling units.

## Abstract
A modular coupling unit which functions as an interface between a communication unit or peripheral apparatus and the communication network includes a code word signal generator for generating a unique address code which is representative of the geographical location in which the re levant coupling unit is permanently included in the com munication network. This signal generator is and continuous to be energized as soon as and for so long as a communication unit or peripheral apparatus is and has been connected to the coupling unit. The address codes generated in bursts by such a generator are transferred via a connecting cable between the relevant communication unit and the coupling unit to this communication unit. The relevant address code is stored there. On request and within the time regime holding for the communication network, the address code is read and trans ferred to a diagnostic module via the communication net work. Thus a geographical survey of the communication net work with the peripheral apparatus connected thereto can be obtained. The geographical address of the communication unit in which a disturbance has occurred can thus be deter mined, using an error search algorithm.
