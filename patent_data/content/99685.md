## Description
3 PYRIDINYL HETEROALKANOLS AND ALKANOIC ACIDS AND ESTERS The present invention relates to 3 pyridinyl oxa, thia , and aza alkanoic acids and esters thereof.Such compounds are potent thromboxane A2 inhibitors and as such represent useful pharmacological agents. Since the discovery that human platelets convert the prostaglandin endoperoxide PGG2 into a labile proaggregatory molecule known as thromboxane A2 TXA2 , researchers have sought compounds that could selectively inhibit the biological activty of TXA2. This end may be achieved in two different ways the synthesis of TXA2 can be blocked by inhibiting the TXA2 synthetase, or a compound could be a receptor level antagonist of TXA2. As therapeutic agents, TXA2 synthetase inhibitors are more useful. See, e.g., R. Gorman,Biological and Pharmacological Evaluation of Thromboxane SynthetaseInhibitors, Advances in Prostaglandin and Thromboxane Research, 6 417 1980 , and references cited therein. A number of thromboxane inhibitors are known.

As noted in the above British patent specification, however, the Inhibitory activity of these latter compounds on thromboxane synthetase is very weak, making them unsatisfactory as practically effective medicines. US A 2,559,546 discloses certain 3 pyridoxy alkanoic acids which are stated to be useful as bactericides.

The compounds of the present invention may be In the form of pharmacol og.i ca.lly acceptable s al ts. These salts are formed when R1 ls a pharmacologically acceptable cation. Such cations include pharmacologically acceptable metal cations, ammonium, amine cations, or quaternary ammonium cations. Especially preferred metal cations are those derived from the alkali metals, e.g., lithium, sodium, and potassium, and from the alkaline earth metals, e.g., magnesium and calcium, although cationic forms of other metals, e.g., aluminum, zinc, and iron are within the scope of this invention. Pharmacologically acceptable amine cations are those derived from primary, secondary, or tertiary amines. Examples of suitable amines are methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, ethylamine, dibutylamine, triisopropylamine, N methylhexylamine, decylamine, dodecylamine, al lylamine, crotylamine, cyclopentylamine, dicyclohexylamine, benzylamine, dibenzylamine, phenylethylamine, B phenylethylamine, ethyl enediamine, diethylenetriamine, and the like aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, araliphatic amines containing up to and including about 18 carbon atoms, as well as heterocyclic amines, e.g., piperidine, morpholine, pyrrolidine, piperazine, and lower alkyl derivatives thereof, e.g., 1 methylpiperidine, 4 ethylmorpholine, 1 isopropylpyrrolidine, 2 methyl pyrrol idi ne, 1,4 dimethylpiperazine, 2 methyl pi peridi ne, and the like, as well as amines containing water solubilizing or hydrophilic groups, e.g, mono , di , and triethanolamine, ethyl di ethanol ami ne, N butyl ethanol amine, 2 ami no 1 butanol, 2 amino 2 ethyl 1,3 propanediol, 2 amino 2 methyl 1 propanol, tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane, N phenylethanolamtne, N p tert amyl phenyl di ethanol amine, glactamine, N methyl glycami ne, N methyl gl ucosami ne, ephedrine, phenyl ephri ne, epinephrine, procaine, and the like.Further useful amine salts are the basic amino acid salts, e.g., lysine and argi nine , E c ampie of suitable pharmacologically acceptable quaternary ammonium cations are tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium, benzyltrtmethylammontum, phenyltriethylammonium, and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are formed at the pyridinyl moiety and are also useful for administering the compounds of this invention. These salts include hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydrolodide, sulfate, phosphate, acetate, propionate, lactate, maleate, malate, succinate, tartrate, and the like. They are prepared by methods well known in the art. The compounds of the present invention will be named herein using the Chemical Abstracts numbering system see Naming and Indexing ofChemical Substances for Chemical Abstracts during the Ninth CollectivePeriod 1972 1976 , a reprint of section IV from the Volume 76 IndexGuide. The compounds of the present invention are tested for TXA2 inhibitions as follows Rabbit aortic strips were superfused in series with Krebs solution. Thromboxane A2 TXA2 was generated by mixing prostaglandinH2 PGH2 with human platelet microsomes HPM . Potential inhibitors were tested by comparing the response of the rabbit aorta tothe amount of TXA2 produced by mixing PGH2 and HPM without the test compound in the reaction medium and then the amount of TXA2 produced when the test compound was added to the HPM 5 minutes before the HPM was mixed with PGH2. By this means compounds which slectively inhibit TXA2 synthetase are found. For a discussion ofTXA2 synthetase inhibition testing see, e.g., R. Gorman, supra. Using this test system, two compounds 3 r3 3 pyridinyl propoxy pronanoic acid, sodium salt Example 3 and 6 EFormyl 3 pyridinyl amino hexanoic acid, sodium salt Example 7 , have been shown to be the most effective in inhibiting TXA2 formation. Both compounds have an approximately ED50 in this system of between 10 and 100 ng ml. The novel compounds of this invention have thus been shown to be highly active as inhibitors of the thromboxane synthetase enzyme system. Accordingly, these novel compounds are useful for administration to mammals, including humans, whenever it is desirable medically to inhibit this enzyme system. For a discussion of the utility of TXA2 inhibitors, see, e.g., Derwent Farmdoc Nos. 18399B 72896B 72897B 63409B, 03755C 03768C and 50111C. Thus, for example, these novel compounds are useful as anti inflammatory agents in mammals and especially humans, and for this purpose, are administered systemically and preferably orally. For oral administration, a dose range of 0.05 to 50 mg per kg of human body weight is used to give relief from pain associated with inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. They are also administered intravenously in aggravated cases of inflammation, preferably in a dose range 0.01 to 100 ug per kg per minute until relief from pain is attained. When used for these purposes, these novel compounds cause fewer and lesser undesirable side effects than do the known synthetase inhibitors used to treat inflammation, for example, aspirin and indomethacin.When these novel compounds are administered orally, they are formulated as tablets, capsules, or as liquid preparations, with the usual pharmaceutical carriers, binders, and the like. For intravenous use, sterile isotonic solutions are preferred. These compounds are useful whenever it is desired to inhibit platelet aggregation, reduce the adhesive character of platelets, and remove or prevent the formation of thrombi in mammals, including man, rabbits, and rats. For example, these compounds are useful in the treatment and prevention of myocardial infarcts, to treat and prevent post operative thrombosis, to promote patency of vascular grafts following surgery, and to treat conditions such as atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, blood clotting defects due to lipemia, and other clinical conditions in which the underlying etiology is associated with lipid imbalance or hyperlipidemta. For these purposes, these compounds are administered systemically, e.g., intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, and in the form of sterile implants for prolonged action.For rapid response especially in emergency situations, the intravenous route of administration is preferred.Doses in the range about 0.005 to about 20 mg per kg of body weight per day are used, the exact dose depending on the age, weight, and condition of the patient or animal, and on the frequency and route of administration. These compounds are further useful as additives to blood, blood products, blood substitutes, or other fluids which are used in artificial extracorporeal circulation or perfusion of isolated body portions, e.g., limbs and organs, whether attached to the original body, detached and being preserved or prepared for transplant, or attached to a new body. During these circulations and perfusions, aggregated platelets tend to block the blood vessels and portions of the circulation apparatus. This blocking is avoided by the presence of these compounds. For this purpose, the compound is added gradually or in single or multiple portions to the circulating blood, to the blood of the donor animal, to the perfused body portion, attached or detached, to the recipient, or to two or all of these at a total steady state dose of about 0.001 to 10 mg per liter of circulating fluid. It is especially useful to use these compounds in laboratory animals, e.g., cats, dogs, rabbits, monkeys, and rats, for these purposes in order to develop new methods and techniques for organ and limb transplants. The compounds of the present invention are useful in mammals, including humans and certain useful animals, e.g., dogs and pigs, to reduce or avoid gastrointestinal ulcer formation, and accelerate the healing of such ulcers already present in the gastrointestinal tract.For this purpose, these compounds are injected or infused intravenously, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly in an infusion dose range about 0.1 ug to about 500 Fg kg of body weight per minute, or in a total daily dose by injection or infusion in the range about 0.1 to about 20 mg kg of body weight per day, the exact dose depending on the age, weight, and condition of the patient or animal, and on the frequency and route of administration. The novel compounds are used for the purposes described above In the free acid form, in ester form, and in the pharmacologically acceptable salt form. When the ester form is used, the ester is any of those within the above definition of R1. However, it is preferred that the ester be alkyl of one to 12 carbon atoms, inclusive. Of the alkyl esters, methyl and ethyl are especially preferred for optimum absorption of the compound by the body or experimental animal system and straight chain octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, and dodecyl are especially preferred for prolonged activity in the body or experimental animal. Thromboxane synthetase converts PGH2 prostaglandin endoperoxide into TXA2. PGH2 is also converted to prostacyclin, PGD2, and other compounds by other enzymes. Thus, because the compounds of this invention inhibit thromboxane A2 synthetase, they increase the PGH2 substrate and thus increase the amount of endogenous prostacyclin.Therefore, they are also useful for many of the pharmacological purposes for which prostacyclin is employed. Prostacyclin and a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor have both been shown to be effective in controlling tumor cell metastasis, see, e.g., K. Honn, et al., Thromboxane Synthetase Inhibitors andProstacyclin Can Control Tumor Cell Metastasis, an Abstract of theTwentieth Annual Meeting of the American Society for Cell Biolpogy, in the Journal of Cell Biology, 87 64 1980 . Similarly, prostacyclin has been shown to be an effective anti hypertensive agent. The compounds of the present invention are also used for this purpose. See, e.g., British patent specification 2,039,903A . For a general discussion of the utility of TXA2 synthetase inhibitors which increase endogenous prostacyclin, see, Aiken, et al.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Enter., 219 299 1981 . The compounds of the present invention are prepared by the methods depicted in Charts A, B and C. In the Charts, R18 is an acid hydrolyzable protecting group, R22 is C1 C12 alkyl, OTs represents a tosylate, and R23 is amine protecting group such as formyl, acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, or trifluoromethanesulfonyl J.B.

Alternatively, an alcohol of the Formula A l is alkylated with a halide of theFormula Zi CH2 nORiB to yield a protected compound of the FormulaA 5. Acid hydrolysis of the Formula A 5 compound yields the FormulaA 6 compound.Oxidation and esterificatlon of the Formula A 6 compound also gives the Formula A 3 compound.

The amine of the Form B 2 is treated with a halide of the Formula Zl CH2 n 1 COOR22 and sodium hydride in a solvent such as DMF to yield the Formula B 3 compound of the present invention. Pharmacologically acceptable salts are prepared by methods described above to yield, e.g., the Formula B 5 compound wherein R2 is CHO and R1 is sodium. Alternatively, this formula B 3 compound wherein R23 is formyl group may be hydrolyzed by known methods, e.g.treatment with hydrochloric acid in methanol water, to give theFormula B 4 compound wherein R2 is hydrogen. Treatment of the FormulaB 4 compound with sodium hydroxide in methanol yields the Formula B 5 compound wherein R2 is hydrogen and R1 is sodium. The Formula B 3 compound may be reduced by known methods, e.g. lithium aluminium hydride, to yield the Formula B 6 compound. Alkylation of thisFormula B 6 compound by the method depicted in Chart A gives the compounds of the Formulas B 7, B 8, and B 9. Conversion of thisFormula B 6 compound with p toluenesulfonyl chloride in pyridine, as is well known in the art, gives the tosylate of the Formula B 10. Alkylation of the Formula B 10 compound with the anion generated from the thiol derivative of the Formula HS CH2 p COOR22 and base, e.g.methyl mercaptopropionate with sodium methoxide in methanol, yields the sulfide of the Formula B il wherein V1 is S .

Alkylation of the Formula C l compound with an anion generated from the amino derivative of the Formula HNR2 CH2 p COOR22 and base, as depicted in Chart B, gives the Formulas C 2 and C 3 compounds wherein Y1 is NR2 .A 3 alkanol pyridine of theFormula A l is treated with p toluenesulfonyl chloride in pyridine to yield the Formula C 4 compound. Alkylation of the Formula C 4 compound with an anion generated from the thiol derivative of theFormula HS CH2 COOR22 and base, as described above, yields the sulfide of the Formula C 5. The Formula C S compound may be reduced and sulfonated to yield the alcohol of the Formula C 6 and the tosylate of the Formula C 7, respectively. Alkylation of the FormulaC 7 compound with thiol or amino anions, as described above, gives theFormulas C 8 and C 9 compounds wherein V1 is S or NR2 t respectively. R18 is a silyl protecting group of the formula Si Gl 3. G1 is alkyl of one to 4 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl of 3 to 10 carbon atoms inclusive, aralkyl of 7 to 12 carbon atoms, inclusive, phenyl, or phenyl substituted with one or 2 fluoro, chloro, or alkyl of one to 4 carbon atoms, with the proviso that in a Si Gl 3 moiety the variousGl s are the same or different and at least one G1 is hindered such as tert butyl . Silyl groups within the scope of Si Gi 3 include dimethylphenylsilyl, triphenylsilyl , t butyldimethylsilyl, or methylphenylbenzylsilyl.With regard to Gi, examples of alkyl are methyl, ethyl, propyl, isobutyl, butyl, sec butyl, tert butyl, pentyl, and the like. Examples of aralkyl are benzyl, phenethyl, a phenylethyl, 3 phenyl propyl , a maphthylmethyl , and 2 a maphthyl ethyl. Examples of phenyl substituted with halo or alkyl are p chlorophenyl, m fluorophenyl, o tolyl, 2,4 dichlorophenyl, ptert butylphenyl , 4 chloro 2 methylphenyl , and 2,4 dichloro 3methylphenyl. Tert butyldimethylsilyl is most preferred as a silylating agent. These silyl groups are known in the art. See for example, Pierce Silylating of Organic Compounds, Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford 111. 1968 . When silylated products of the charts below are intended to be subjected to chromatographic purification, then the use of silyl groups known to be unstable to chromatography is to be avoided.Further, when silyl groups are to be introduced selectively, silylating agents which are readily available and known to be useful in selective silylations are employed. For example, triphenylsilyl and t butyldimethylsilyl groups are employed when selective introduction is required. A particularly useful silyl group for this purpose is t butyldimethylsilyl, although other silyl groups are likewise employed. Other protective groups within the scope of R18 are any group which replaces a hydroxy hydrogen and is neither attacked by nor is as reactive to the reagents used in the transformations used herein as a hydroxy is and which is subsequently replaceable by acid hydrolysis with hydrogen. Several such protective groups are known In the art, e.g., tetrahydropyranyl and substituted tetrahydropyranyl. See for reference E.J. Corey, Proceedings of the Robert A. Welch FoundationConferences on Chemical Research, XII Organic Synthesis, pgs. 51 79 1969 .Those blocking groups which have been found useful include a tetrahydropyranyl b tetrahydrofuranyl and c a group of the formula C OR1l Rl2 CH Rl3 Rl4 , wherein Rii is alkyl of one to 18 carbon atoms, inclusive, cycloalkyl of 3 to 10 carbon atoms, inclusive, aralkyl of 7 to 12 carbon atoms, inclusive, phenyl or phenyl substituted wityh one to 3 alkyl of one to 4 carbon atoms, inclusive, wherein R12 and Ri3 are alkyl of one to 4 carbon atoms, inclusive, phenyl, phenyl substituted with one, 2, or 3 alkyl of one to 4 carbon atoms, inclusive, or when Rl2 and R13 are taken together CH2 a or when R12 and R13 are taken together CH2 b O CH2 c, wherein a is 3, 4, or 5 and b is one, 2 or 3, and c is one, 2, or 3, with the proviso that b plus c is 2, 3, or 4, with the further proviso that Rl2 and R13 may be the same or different, and wherein R14 is hydrogen or phenyl. When the blocking group R8 is tetrahydropyranyl, the tetrahydropyranyl ether derivative of any hydroxy moieties of the CBA type intermediates herein is obtained by reaction of the hydroxy containing compound with 2,3 dihydropyran in an inert solvent, e.g., dichloromethane, in the presence of an acid condensing agent such as p toluenesulfonic acid or pyridine hydrochloride. The dihydropyran is used in large stoichiometric excess, preferably 4 to 100 times the stiochiometric amount. The reaction is normally complete in less than an hour at 20 50 C. When the protective group is tetrahydrofuranyl, 2,3 dihydrofuran is used, as described in the preceding paragraph, in place of the 2,3 dihydropyran. When the protective group is of the formula C ORi1 R12 CH Rl3 Rl4 , wherein Rill, R12, Rl3, and Rik are as defined above a vinyl ether or an unsaturated cyclic or heterocyclic compound, e.g., 1 cycl ohexen 1 yl methyl ether, or 5 ,6 di hydro 4 methoxy2Hpyran i is employed. See C.B. Reese, et al., Journal of the Chemical Society 86, 3366 1967 . The reaction conditions for such vinyl ethers and unsaturated compounds are similar to those for dihydropyran above. The protective groups as defined by R18 are removed by mild acidic hydrolysis. For example, by reaction with 1 hydrochloric acid in methanol 2 a mixture of acetic acid, water, and tetrahydrofuran, or 3 aqueous citric acid or aqueous phosphoric acid in tetrahydrofuran, at temperatures below 550 C, hydrolysis of the blocking group Is achieved. Certain compounds of the present invention are preferred. Thus, compounds of the Formula I wherein the sum of m n p is 2 to 7, X1 is O or NH , V1 is valance bond, Ql is C02R1, R1 is hydrogen, methyl, or a pharmacologically acceptable cation are preferred. Also preferred are compounds of the Formula I wherein the sum of m n p is 2 to 7, X1 is NCHO , V1 is O or a valence bond, and Rl is hydrogen, methyl, or a pharmacologically acceptable cation.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present invention is seen more fully by the Examples given below.Preparation 1 3 Bromo chloro 1 propanol, t Butyldimethylsilyl Ether Refer to Chart A preparation of starting material 3 Bromo 1 propanol Aldrich Chemical Co. 25.0 g, 180 mmol and imidazole Aldrich Chemical Co. 36.7 g, 539 mmol are dissolved in 100 ml dimethylformamide.

While purging the system with nitrogen, t butyldimethylsilyl chloride 40.7 g, 270 mmol is added In portions via a powder funnel over 20 mln. Upon complete addition the resulting solution is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 17 hr. Again the solution is cooled to 0 C and 50 ml of water is added. Upon warming to room temperature another 50 ml water is added, the mixture is stirred for 10 min and then diluted with an additional 100 ml water. This mixture is extracted with 500 ml ether and the organic phase is washed with 100 ml 10 aqueous sodium bisulfate, 100 ml saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate twice with 100 ml brine, dried over MgS04, filtered and concentrated by atmospheric distillation.The concentrate was distilled at 7 torr collecting a 29.83 g fraction boiling at 61 68 C. All distillate boiling below 610 C is discarded . Analysis of this fraction by gas chromatography 150 C, 6 ft 10 carbowax 20 M column showed the presence of two components in approximately equal amounts retention times of 0.5 min and 0.7 min, respectively , while the pot residue is essentially comprised of only one component corresponding to the longer retention time component of the major fraction.
