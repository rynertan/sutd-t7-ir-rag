# Dry nonelectroscopic toners and process for toning tacky image surfaces.

## Abstract
Dry nonelectroscopic toners comprising pigmented organic resin particles having a size distribution of 0.2 to 30 micrometers, not more than 50 percent of the particles being less than 1 micrometer surface treated with a combination of at least 1 by weight of an antistatic agent and at least 0.5 of a slip agent as described. The preparation of the toners is described. The toners are useful in color developing positive and negative working photosensitive elements particularly in an automatic toning machine. Improved clean up and low stain propensity are achieved.
