1. A B B A 1 10 block copolymers, wherein A is an aromatic polyvinyl and or polyisopropenyl se quence, and B is a hydrogenated polydienic sequence, characterized in that the sequence A is not hydrogenated, and the sequence B shows a hydrogenation of at least 90 of the original unsaturations.

## Description
The block copolymers of type AB BA In the case of block copolymers of traditional type, on the basis of styrene, the stability of the networks is conditioned by the low value of T Poly α methylstyrene, which has a T In polymeric materials, a characteristic of consi derable importance is the resistance to oxidation, and the presence in these block copolymers of unsaturated phases of dienic type limits their stability to a notice able extent. If improving this property is desired, hy drogenating the unsaturated moiety, but without losing the elastic properties typical of the soft phase, is hence important. To that purpose, having a dienic soft phase with a well precise molecular architecture is ne cessary dienic structures with high 1 4 content shall yield, on hydrogenation, rigid products of polyethylene type whilst when the interchaining is rich in 1 2 structure, after the hydrogenation products are obtained of polybutene type , which do not display properties satisfactory from the technological viewpoint. It is important as well that the dienic soft phase be not contaminated by the presence of hard phase pure and not tapered structure , to the purpose of achieving a satisfactory separation between the phases, and conse quently, improved technological properties. The purpose of the present invention is obtaining block copolymers of pure type, containing a hard phase on the basis of α methylstyrene and or similar monomers, yielding high transient phases and a soft phase of di enic type butadiene, isoprene , which can be hydrogen ated to yield thermoelastomers which display at the same time, relatively to the traditional styrene based thermo elastomers, both high operating temperature because of the presence of the high transient hard phase and excel lent resistance to oxidation thanks to the presence of a saturated elastomeric soft phase . This soft phase has been synthetized under such operating conditions, in order not to pollute such a phase by the presence of even very small aliquots of hard phase. From patent literature, some examples are known of block copolymers on the basis of α methylstyrene, but none of them is pertinent to the purpose we intended to achieve. In fact, U.S. patent 4,246,372 to Phillips dis closes products wherein the dienic soft phase is polluted by the presence of hard phase α methylstyrene and the products obtained have not been hydrogenated U.S. patent 3,825,623 to Polysar discloses products which are not hydrogenated, and the properties of which, as regards the oxidation, are consequently poor. U.K. patent 1,302,111 to Shell relates to block copolymers A B B A Moreover, we have a soft tapered phase i.e. impure due to α methylstyrene or its derivatives , rather than a soft pure phase , dur to the particular process whereby the nonhydrogenated A B B A The end product shows different properties, such as, e.g., poor elastic properties, and reduced rubbery pla teau , which make it suitable to uses different from those our product is intended for. An object of the present invention are hence block copolymers A B A B In the block copolymers of the present invention A aromatic polyvinyl and or polyisopropenyl sequence styrene excluded B polydienic and or hydrogenated sequence. with R H, CH₃ 60 250 and their different possible isomers. 350 750 wherein 700 750 . A second object of the present invention is a multi step process for the synthesis of the block copolymers described above, such steps being exemplifiable as foll lows A detailed disclosure of the process provides in the first step the polymerization in bulk, and or in concen trated solutions, of α methylstyrene, and or similar monomers. α MS is the preferred monomer, because of its avail ability and low cost however, other similar monomers can be used, such as α methyl 4 butylstyrene, α methyl 3,5 di tert.butylstyrene, α methyl 4 phenyl styrene, α meth yl 4 cyclohexylstyrene, isopropenylnaphthalene, and so forth. The polymerization of α methylstyrene and or simi lar monomers is carried out in the absence, or substan tial absence, of diluents or solvents in case in which a monomer solid at room temperature, such as, e.g., isopro penylnaphthalene, is polymerized, the same is dissolved in an amount of solvent as small as possible, such a solvent being selected among aromatic, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons, such as, e.g., toluene, either alone or in mixture . The polymerization in the absence or substantial absence of diluents or solvents of α methylstyrene and or similar monomers is carried out with or without the presence of polar activators, at a temperature comprised within the range of from 80 to 80 C, but preferably comprised within the range of from 10 to 30 C when the process is carried out in the absence of diluent or solvent, and of from 50 to 50 C when the process is carried out in the presence of a diluent or solvent. The polar activator used must be not contraindicated for the good performance of the subse quent steps, and in particular, it must not favour the randomization of the excess of α methylstyrene as it shall be more clearly evidenced in the disclosure of the 3rd step due to this reason, K tert.butoxide, or other activators of this type cannot be used. As a function of the polymerization time adopted, the conversion of α methylstyrene, and hence the molecular weight can be controlled as desired, but under experimental conditions of practical interest the total conversion is not reach ed, some α methylstyrene remaining hence in the not polymerized state. The molecular weight can be further more regulated by adopting a suitable monomer to initia tor ratio. The initiators used are typical initiators of the anionic polymerization monolithium derivatives of formula RLi are preferably used, wherein R is an aliphat ic, cycloalifatic and aromatic hydrocarbon radical more frequently, aliphatic monolithium derivatives are used. Typical examples are Li n.butyl, Li sec.butyl, Li n.decyl, Li phenyl and Li cyclohexyl. In the second step, a small amount of diene is added in bulk to the poly α methylstyrenic carbanion, said amount being such that the ratio of diene to the anionic polymerization initiator be 10 the reaction is very rapid, and within a short time, the complete transforma tion occurs into the dienic carbanion. This prevents the depolymerization of the poly α methylstyrene chain which, as known, has a very low value of ceiling temperature, and makes it possible to subsequently operate at higher temperatures and at greater dilutions in the subsequent step, wherein the dienic component is polymerized. In the third step, the polymerization of the diene is carried out under very controlled conditions, so to obtain the desired 1 2 microstructure this, because the polymer must be subsequently hydrogenated , but without the α methylstyrene monomer still present as residue from the first step being assembled into the dienic phase. So, the amount of solvent sufficient to lower the viscosity of the solution is added, up to obtain a solution at 8 by weight, such a solution being hence suitable to be properly stirred. Suitable solvents comprise aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons generally used for this particular type of polmerization, either alone, or mixed with each other. Cyclohexane is the preferred sol vent. Besides the solvent, into the reaction medium such suitable activator compounds are injected, if they have not been already added in the first step, so to accom plish the desired microstructure of the dienic phase, but without allowing the residual α methylstyrene in the dienic phase to randomize. To that purpose, the use of tetrahydrofuran THF or of activator agents having the same capabilites has resulted satisfactory by varying the concentration of THF, varying as desired the dienic structure has been possible Controlling the amount of 1,2 microstructure has resulted possible also by varying the polymerization temperature. Besides THF, dioxane, diethyleneglycoldimethylether, tetramethylenediamine have been successfully used, but THF has resulted to be the preferred activator. The amount of activator agent used has been varied within the range of from 150 ppm to 2000 ppm. The polymerization has been carried out at tempera tures comprised within the range of from 20 to 120 C, but preferably of from 60 to 80 C The conjugated dienes used are those containing from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, of type 1,3 butadiene and isoprene the preferred ones , but also 1,3 pentadiene piperyl ene , 2,3 dimethyl 1,3 butadiene, 2 methyl 1,3 pentadi ene, 2,3 dimethyl 1,3 pentadiene, 2 methyl 3 ethyl,3 pentadiene, 2 phenyl 1,3 butadiene, and so forth, either alone or mixed with each other, can be used. In the fourth step, the living polymeric carbanions have been terminated by coupling agents, to yield prod ucts of type AB BA To that purpose, a wide range of products can be used, but the most suitable have resulted the compounds of type 2,6 distyrylpyridine, diphenyldichlorosilane, tristyrylpyridine, methyltrichlorosilane, silicon tetra chloride. The reaction has been carried out by adding the above listed agents in the suitable stoichiometric ratio see the functionality to accomplish the linear and or stellar product desired. The reaction has been generally carried out at the same temperature at which the polymerization has been carried out, for times comprised within the range of from a few minutes to one hour, as a function of the type of agent used, and of the experimental conditions adopted, according to a methodology known. The hydrogenation of the so obtained products has been carried out in a pressurized reactor, by adding to the polymeric solution to be hydrogenated the catalyst and the co catalyst in the optimum ratio, and by operat ing under the suitable hydrogen pressure. As the cata lyst, such derivatives of cobalt, nickel, etc., as alkox ides, naphthenates, and so forth, have been used prefer ably, cobalt 2 ethylhexanoate as been used. As the co catalyst, lithium alkyls, aluminum alkyls, polyiminohal anes, and so forth, have been used preferably, lithium alkyls have been used, operating with a Li Co ratio of 3. The pressure under which this step has been carried out varied within the range of from 1 atmosphere to 50 atmospheres, and the temperature was comprised wihin the range of 20 25 C to 180 C preferably, the operating conditions have been temperature of 100 140 C and pres sure of 12 20 atm. Within times of a few hours, a high hydrogenation efficiency has been obtained. The materials so obtained have been evaluated by comparison to the not hydrogenated products. Viscoelastic measurements in the solid state have been carried out by the Rheovibron, at the frequency of 110 Hz, tensile measurements have been carried out ac cording to DIN 53504 Standard, and, above all, measure ments of thermo oxidative ageing in oven with forced air circulation and ageing tests in Weather O Meter with full light cycle, and temperature of the black screen of 65 C have been carried out. The data obtained evidences the presence of wide and weel defined rubbery plateaux, optimum elastic response which confirms the pure nature of the dienic soft block and, above all, very good resistance to thermo and pho to oxidative ageing which, by combining with the high operating temperature allowed by the presence of the high transient hard phase, renders these materials parti cularly attractive. The following Examples have the purpose of illus trating the invention more specifically, without limiting it. Into a glass reactor of 1 litre of capacity, with perfectly tight sealing with stainless head, equipped with stirrer, way for reactants inlet, way for nitrogen inlet, and temperature and pressure measuring gauges, after complete deaerating, 50 ml 45 g of α methylstyr ene α MS and 1.28 mmol of Li sec.butyl are intro duced, allowing the polymerization to proceed at room temperature for 60 minutes. Thereafter, 0.6 ml 0.58 g of THF,and 5 g of butadiene are injected and allowed to react for 5 minuted, always at room temperature. The red colour of α methylstyrenic carbanion disappears nearly instantaneously, and a straw yellow colour develops. At this point, the reaction mass is diluted with 400 ml of cyclohexane, and all the residual butadiene 28,7 g is introduced, and made polymerize over 1 hour at 60 C. A small sample of polymer is drawn and sent to G.P.C. analysis. Finally, 0.6 mmol of 2,6 distyrylpyridine is intro duced, allowing the coupling reaction to occur at 80 C for 15 minutes. The coupling yield is greater than 95 . The product of AB BA type 50.7 g , the composition and data relating to the molecular weight of which, together with those of corresponding AB product are re ported in Table 1, is separated under high vacuum from monomer α methylstyrene which shall be recycled and, again redissolved in cyclohexane, is sent to the subse quent hydrogenation step. Per each 100 meq of double bonds, 0.4 mmol of co balt 2 etnylhexanoate and Li sec.butyl Li Co 2.8 is added, and the reaction is carried out at 100 C for 5 hours under a hydrogen pressure of 20 atm. Under these conditions, the hydrogenation is nearly complete 5 of residual unsaturations . The polymeric solution is purified by washing with H₂O acid, ionol is added as antioxidizer, and the solvent is removed by steam distillation, the copolymer being finally dried under high vacuum, at 80 C for 15 hours. The stress strain curve of this product Fig.1, wherein on the abscissae the strain and on the ordi nates the stress as MPA is reported shows the high strengthening effect at high strains, typical of the block copolymers of AB BA type. Furthermore, the high strains witness to the good elastic character of the soft phase, which has been built in pure way. It has been demonstrated indeed in a test experience that under the experimental conditions we adopted in this Example, practically no insertion of α methylstyrenic units in the dienic chain occurs ¹H N.M.R. examination . The dynamic mechanical spectrum Fig. 2, wherein at fig. 2 a on the abscissae the temperature as C, and on the ordinates the tan δ, adimensional, is reported and at fig. 2 b, on the abscissae the temperature as C and on the ordinates the E as MPA s is reported , evidences the well defined rubbery plateau , which extends up to high temperatures above 150 C and, around 35 C, an absorption peak of the saturated elastomeric phase eth ylene butene copolymer . D.S.C. curve is in compliance with the performance expected on the basis of the data of composition of the dienic phase vinyl content before the hydrogenation. The transitions of the hydrogenated soft phase at 59 C the lower value than observed on Rheovibron is correct, because the two methodologies are different and minor transitions of the polyethylene phase around 0 C are clearly individuated, whilst the transition due to the poly α methylstyrene based hard phase, occurring around 170 C is not much evidenced. The measurements of thermo oxidative ageing and the ageing tests on Weather O Meter have shown the considera ble stability of the hydrogenated relatively to the not hydrogenated product. In fact, whilst in the first case the ultimate tensile strength and the ultimate elongation remain practically unchanged, in the second case a consi derable reduction in ultimate elongation and an extreme reduction in ultimate tensile strength can even be ob served. The test is carried out as described in the preced ing Example, with the only difference that α methylstyr ene is polymerized for 50 minutes, and in the subsequent polymerization of butadiene, a lower amount of THF 0.43 g is charged, to the purpose of achieving a polymer with lower vinyl structure. Product shaving the composition and molecular weights as reported in Table 2 are isolated. The tensile data referring to the hydrogenated prod uct evidences a strengthening action slightly lower than that of preceding sample, due to the lower content of hard phase, and an extremely good elastic response. The data on Rheovibron evidence a well defined rub bery plateau, whilst on D.S.C. examination, transitions to be attributed to the greater amount of polyethylene units are observed. The test is carried out as disclosed in Example 2, but with the difference that the amount of Li sec.butyl is of 1.0 mmol, and that instead of THF, TMEDA 2 mmol 0.24 g is used. The products having the composition and molecular weight characteristics as reported in Table 3 are isolat ed. Example 1 is repeated with the only differences that, as the coupling agent, silicon tetrachloride in suitable stoichiometric ratio 1 4 of Li value is used, and that in lieu of butadiene, isoprene is used, a prod uct being obtained which shows molecular and technologic al properties in compliance with the expected ones. Example 1 is repeated with the only difference that the hydrogenation reaction is carried out by using a nickel naphthenate as the catalyst, aluminum trialkyl as the co catalyst, at 65 C, under a hydrogen pressure of 20 atm. The properties of the product obtained are at all comparable to those of product described in Example 1. The process is carried out in the same equipment as described in Example 1, 2 isopropenylnaphthalene 2 IPN being polymerized in solution in tetrahydrofuran at low temperature. At the end, a small amount of butadiene is added, which transforms within a short time, and quanti tatively, the dark green carbanion of 2 IPN into straw yellow dienic carbanion. The temperature is then allowed to rise to room temperature, toluene is added, the excess of tetrahydro furan being distilled off, up to perform the subsequent polymerization of butadiene to the desired values of vinylic microstructure with subsequent hydrogenation . The process is then continued as described, a prod uct being obtained, the transition of the hard phase of which occurs, from D.S.C. data, at about 210 C. The technological data evidences the very good pro perties as expected well defined rubbery plateaux ex tended up to about 200 C, very good elastic response, excellent thermo oxidative and photo oxidative resist ance
