# Process for producing N halomethyl acylamides.

## Abstract
N halomethyl acylamdes of the formula XCH₂ CO CH₂R² are prepared by reacting the corresponding N alkoxyme thyl acylamides of the formula XCH₂ CO CH₂OR¹ with thionyl chloride or thionyl bromide in the presence of a Lewis Acid catalyst, where in the above formulae X is hydrogen, halogen, a C₁ ₆ alkyl or haloalkyl radical, a C₃ ₇ cycloalkyl radical, a phenyl or benzyl radical or any of said radicals substituted with halogen, NO₂, CF₃, C₁ ₆ alkyl or alkoxy, phenyl or benzyl R is a C₁ ₂₀ alkyl radical, an acyclic 1 alken 1 yl radical having up to 10 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl or 1 cycloalken 1 yl radical having up to 7 carbon atoms, a phenyl radical or said cycloalkyl, 1 cyclo alken 1 yl or phenyl radicals substi tuted with one or more C₁ ₆ alkyl, alkoxy or alkoxyalkyl, C₂ ₄ alkenyl or C₃ ₄ alkenyloxy, NO₂ or trifiuoromethyl radicals or halogen R¹ is a hydrocarbyl radical having up to 10 carbon atoms or such radical substituted with halogen or C₁ ₈ alkoxy or alkoxyalkyl groups and R² is a chloro or bromo atom.
