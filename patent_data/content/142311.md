# Low profile electrical connector assembly.

## Abstract
A low profile electrical connector assembly comprises matable first and second dielectric housing members 11,41 having first and second matable electrical contacts 31, 60 secured respectively therein. The first electrical contact 31 comprises a resilient hooked contact portion 37 disposed about a supporting rib 15 extending from a wall in the first housing member 11 in the mating direction. The second electrical contact 60 comprises a base plate 61 which extends parallel to the mating direction and includes a conductor connecting portion 62, 62 extending outwardly from the ends of the base plate 61 from one side of the base 61 and a contact portion 63, 63 extending outwardly from sides of the base plate 61 from the other side of the base plate 61 so that the contact portion 63, 63 resiliently engages the hooked contact portion 37 in an interference fit when the housings 11, 41 mate together.
