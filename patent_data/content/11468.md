In order to strengthen the installation on the securing area 25 pf the tread base sheet member 61, the edge covering bead 23 and the framing bead 24 are provided with inclined abutment surfaces 63, b4, respectively. Therefore, if the tread mat 62 is secured in the securing area 25, abutting the front and rear edges 65, 66 to the inclined abutment surfaces 63, 64, respectively, the front and rear edges 65, 66 of the tread mat 62 are covered with the inclined abutment surfaces 63, 64. Thus the tread mat 62 is fixed on the securing area 25. Since the front and rear edges 65, bb of the tread mat 62 are covered with the inclined abutment surfaces 63, 64 respectively, falling out and fraying at the front and rear edges 65, 66 of the tread mat 62 can be prevented. Further, if the base cloth of the tread mat 62 is dipped in dissolved rubber, the tread mat 62 can be firmly secured on the securing area 25. The stair mat 70 as shown in Figure 8, has securing grooves 72, 73 which may be substituted for the inclined abutment surfaces 63, 64 in the stair mat 60 as above mentioned. The stair mat 70 includes a tread base sheet member 71 adhered on the tread 81 of the step 80 and the tread mat 62 secured on the securing area 25 of the base sheet member 71. The edge covering bead 23 and the framing bead 24 are provided with the securing grooves 72, 73 formed integrally with the front and the rear edges of the base sheet member 71 respectiwtely. Thus, the securing grooves 72, 73 are formed at the edge covering bead 23 and the framing bead 24, respectively, so the tread mat 62 is fixed on the securing area 25, with the front and the rear edges 65, 66 of the tread mat 62 inserted into the securing grooves 72, 73 respectively. Therefore the tread mat 62 can be more fixed on te securing area 25 in comparison with the stair mat 6o as shown in Figure 7, and falling out and fraying at the front and rear edges 65, 66 of the tread mat 62 can be prevented. As above mentioned, the tread mat 62 of the stair mat 60, 70 can be firmly fixed by the tread base check member 61, 71, and it is easy to handle and install the stair mats 60, 70. The tread mat 62 can be easily changed. Further, it is easy to clean the stairs and the tread mat 62 can be washed if the tread mat 62 is detached. As entioned above the deseribed stair mats of the present invo ion are suitable for a mat installed on the stairs of the building, especially whe deadening of the sound of footsteps is reouired
