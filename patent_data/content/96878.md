# Fabrication of preforms for optical fibers by chemical vapor deposition using a plasma torch.

## Abstract
Hydroxyl free deposition with high efficiency and at a high deposition rate may be achieved, even with use of relatively inexpensive raw materials, by utilizing a ring shaped plasma activated axial chemical vapor deposition obtaining 100 chemical conversion and fractional vola tilization of impurities. The plasma 2 is induced in an annular stream of a plasma forming gaseous medium, and the reactant or reactants used in the axial chemical vapor deposition are introduced into the center of the ring shaped plasma 2 to be converted by the heat of the plasma flame into glass precursor particulate which is deposited on a bait 4. An annular stream of a cooling medium flows outwardly past the plasma flame and is circumferentially centered by an extension 19 of the outer tubular element 9 of a plas ma torch 1 in which the plasma is generated. An RF generator 18 which induces the plasma is operated at a frequency exceeding 20 MHz to give the plasma flame the desired ring shaped configuration.
