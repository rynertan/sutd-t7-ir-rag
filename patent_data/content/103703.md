# VAPOR PHASE CHLORINATION OF POLYOLEFINS

## Abstract
An improved vapor phase process for chlorination of polyethylene in a fluidized bed is accomplished by chlorinat ing a mixture of powdered polyethylene and finely divided inorganic compounds having a dielectric constant of greater than about 40 and specific conductivity of greater than 10 ¹³ and less than 10 ¹ Ω ¹cm ¹ such as titanium dioxide, with chlorine, optionally under actinic light, at an initial tempera ture from about 20 to about 70 C and raising the tempera ture of the reaction to at least about the crystalline melting point of the polyethylene and continuing the reaction until the polyethylene contains greater than 25 to 45 weight percent bound chlorine.
