# Method of depositing a highly conductive, highly transmissive film.

## Abstract
An improved method of and apparatus for depositing metallic oxide coatings that are highly electrically transmis sive and highly electrically conductive onto a substrate. An r.f. signal is employed to develop an ionized plasma of metal and oxygen atoms, said plasma adapted for deposition onto a large area substrate which preferably includes semicon ductor layers thereon. The method and apparatus of this invention are particularly adapted for the improved deposi tion of transmissive and conductive coatings which include low melting point metals onto the surface of plastic, glass or metallic substrates. The deposition may be accomplished in either a continuous or batch process mode.
