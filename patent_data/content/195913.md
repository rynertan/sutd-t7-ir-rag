# Sleeve valve for a pulsed gas generator.

## Abstract
The combination of a pulsed rocket engine 12 and a sleeve valve 10 coupled to the engine output and receiving in its internal chamber 16 the gas generated by the engine 12. The sleeve valve 10 has a movable sleeve 24 with ports 26, 28 therethrough surrounding the wall 18 of the chamber 16, the wall 18 having ports 38, 40 which axially align with the sleeve ports 26, 28 in the valve s open position to allow rapid dis charge of the contents of the chamber 16. The sleeve is ordi narily biased to a closed, or non aligned, position for the ports by a spring 32. When the gas pressure in the chamber 16 reaches a predetermined amount, a pressure sensor 54 com mands a gas source to send pressurized gas into the valve 10 to force the sleeve 24 into its open position against the bias of the spring 32, thereby aligning the ports 26, 28 and 38, 40 and allowing rapid discharge of the gas from the sleeve valve chamber 16.
