ENHANCED SOLUBItITY ASFARTAME COMPOUNDSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a class of novel dipeptide sweetener compositions and to a method for increasing the solubility of dipeptide sweeteners. In particular, this invention relates to sweetener compositions comprising a mixture of a dipeptide sweetener and one or more solubilizing agents. The invention further relates to a method for increasing the solubility of dipeptide sweeteners in aqueous solutions. It has been found that certain dipeptide compounds, in particular a L aspartylphenylalanine methyl ester aspartame , possess an intense sweetness. Aspart2me s preparation and use are described in U. S. Patents.Nos. 3,492, 131 3,642,491 and 3,780,189. These patents are incorporated herein by reference. Although these dipeptides possess significant sweetening properties, such dipeptides generally have limited solubility and the rate of dissolution of the dipeptides into aqueous solutions is markedly slower than sucrose. While the problem of dissolution rate and solubility of dipeptide sweeteners is well documented, little has been done to overcome the problem. Attempts to increase the solubility of the dipeptides via the formation of various salts and metal complexes of the dipeptides have been described. U.S. Patent No. 4,029,701 describes the hydrohalide salts of dipeptide sweeteners as being more soluble in aqueous solutions than the dipeptide sweetener itself.However, such dipeptide hydrochloride salts do not exhibit thermal stability. U.S. Patent 4,153,737 discloses enhanced solubility of sodium and potassium salts of aspartame in glycerin. Sulfate salts and alkyl sulfonate salts of aspartame exhibiting high thermal stability and. a fast rate of dissolution in aqueous media, are disclosed in U. S. Application Serial No. 66 383,393. In addition,U. S. Application Serial No. 06 354,574 relates to dipeptide sweetener metal complexes which exhibit increased solubility in aqueous solutions. U.S. Patent 3,761,288 describes a method for spray drying aspartame in order to increase the solubility of aspartame.However, all the above references disclose dipeptide sweeteners and respective salts and metal complexes of such dipeptide sweeteners which are structurally characterized as single compounds or complexes.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTTON The present invention relates to a novel class of dipeptide sweetener compositions comprising a mixture of a dipeptide sweetener of the formula EMI4.1 wherein the stereochemical configuration is DL DL, DL L, L DL, or L L wherein R is a alkyl of from one to six carbon atoms, inclusive b arylalkyl, the alkyl portion of from one to six carbon atoms, inclusive, the aryl portion of from six to ten carbon atoms inclusive or c cycloalkyl of from three to seven carbon atoms inclusive wherein n is an integer of from 0 to 5 wherein Rl is a alkyl of one to six carbon atoms, inclusive or b a saturated, unsaturated, or partially saturated 6 carbon ring, which may be optionally unsubstituted or substituted at the 4 position by R2. wherein R2 is a hydroxy b alkoxy of one to six carbon atoms, inclusive c alkyl of one to six carbon atoms, inclusive d halogen or e S O f CH2 k CH3 wherein f is 0, 1, or 2, wherein k is an integer of from 0 to 5, with the proviso that n is 1 or 2 and a solubizing agent, wherein the solubilizing agent isH2S04 or a solubilizing salt selected from the group consisting of NaHSO4 KHSO4 NH4HSO4 CaCl2 MgCl2 A1 E504 3 Al HSO4 S04 Al2 HSO4 4SO4 Mg2 HSO4 2SO4 Ca HSO4 2 Ca2 HSO4 2SO4 Mg HSO4 2 Zn HSO4 2 Zn2 HSO4 2SO4 Fe II HSO4 2 Fe III HSO4 3 Fe II 2 HSO4 2SO4 and Fe III HSO4 SO4 and Fe III 2 HSO4 4SO4, and wherein the dipeptide sweetener and solubilizing agent are in a stoichiometric ratio of from 10 1 to about 1 20. In addition, the invention relates to a method of preparing sweetened aqueous solutions comprising adding the above described sweetener compositions to an aqueous solution or adding a dipeptide sweetener to an aqueous solution containing one or more of the above sqlubilizing agents. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A preferred dipeptide sweetener is aspartame. The preferred compositions of the present invention comprise a mixture of aspartame and one or more solubilizing agents selected from the class consisting ofKHSO4 NaHSO4 Mg ESOn zSO4 and Ca HSO4 2. The most preferred compositions comprise a mixture of aspartame and NaHSO4 and or KHSO4. Examples of alkyl of from one to six carbon atoms, inclusive are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl and the isomeric forms thereof. Examples of an aryl portion of from six to ten carbon atoms inclusive are phenyl, naphthyl and benzyl. Examples of cycloalkyl of from three to seven carbon atoms, inclusive are cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclohexyl, cyclopentyl, and cycloheptyl. Examples of alkoxy of from one to six carbon atoms inclusive are methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy, pentoxy, and hexoxy and the isomeric forms thereof. Examples of halogen are chlorine, bromine and fluorine. Examples of aqueous systems include water, and food stuffs containing water. The preferred stoichiometric ratio of dipeptide sweetener solubilizing salt is in a range of about 2 1 to 1 2 and most preferred in a range of 1 1 to 1 2. The compositions of the present invention are prepared by merely admixing one or more solubilizing agents with a dipeptide sweetener. When the solubilizing agent is a salt, the resulting composition is a physical mixture of a dipeptide sweetener and a solubilizing salt and involves no chemical interaction between the dipeptide sweetener and solubilizing salt. Therefore, in view of the fact that compositions of the present invention are only physical mixtures of a dipeptide sweetener and a solubilizing salt, the use of such compositions to prepare sweetened solutions eliminates the time and expense associated with the preparation of dipeptide sweetener salts. In addition, the use of the compositions of the present invention permits one to vary the solubility of the dipeptide by merely using varying amounts of the solubilizing agents. Solutions containing the dipeptide sweeteners are ,prepared by either dissolving a composition comprising a dipeptide sweetener and a solubilizing agent in an aqueous solution or dissolving a dipeptide sweetener directly into an aqueous solution containing one or more solubilizing ,agents. Gentle heating and or stirring may be used to improve the dissolution rate for the preparation of concentrated solutions. The compositions of the present invention possess sweetness characteristics and may be formulated for a number of useful applications. For example, a sachet, packet or tablet may be prepared for consumer use for preparation of liquid sweetening or sweetened solutions. On an industrial scale, the compositions of the present invention may be sold in bulk for preparation for use of concentrated sweetening solutions in restaurants, wholesale food manufacturers and the like. The high concentration solution containing the sweetener composition may be used as a liquid, low calorie sweetener Such a liquid, low calorie sweetener may find utility in facilitating the manufacturing process in such foodstuffs as gelatin desserts, fruit flavored beverages, cereal, cake mixes, fruit juices, syrups, salad dressings, pet foods, tabletop sweeteners and the like. It is important to note that the compositions of the present invention are stable. The compositions of the present invention comprising a dipeptide sweetener and a salt may be stored dry and reconstituted as needed.However, it should be obvious to those skilled in the art that its utility is not restricted to the systems set forth herein and may find invaluable applicaton in pharmaceutical preparations, such as tonics and the like. The invention will appear more fully from the examples which follow.
