# Apparatus for cooling, drying and cleaning elongate material.

## Abstract
Apparatus for use in cooling and or drying or cleaning elongate material 21 , such as drawn wire, tube or strip material, the apparatus comprising a chamber 33 , which may be formed at least in part by a flexible tube 26 , having an inlet 27 and an outlet 30 through which the material 21 enters and leaves the chamber 33 , and the chamber 33 is connected via an outlet passage 34 to means 36 for creating a sub atmospheric pressure within the chamber 33 . The sub atmospheric pressure lowers the evaporation temperature of the cooling liquid which is on the surface of the material 21 which evaporates and cools the material and the sub atmospheric pressure causes air to flow into the chamber 33 around the material 21 in the region of the outlet 30 and this airflow is at high velocity and wipes the material 21 . The apparatus is preferably located on the end of a structure 10 in which a drawing die 12 is housed.
