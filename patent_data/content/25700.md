# Continuous duty chemically sanitizing batch rinse system and method.

## Abstract
A chemically sanitizing rinse solution 26 is prepared in batches of variable sizes, but with a preselected substantially constant proportion of water and chemical sanitizing agent, in a rinse solution mixing tank 22 , for demand consumption on a continuous duty basis, by delivering the sanitizing agent, by means of a pump 36 , and by admitting fresh water, via a water control valve 42 , to the mixing tank in response to predeter mined level changes of the solution therein as detected by up per and lower float switches 50 64, 48 52 .
