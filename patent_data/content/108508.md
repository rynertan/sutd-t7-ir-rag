# Hydrogen uptake gene cosmid and process of constructing same.

## Abstract
Two essentially pure replicons, pHU1 and pHU2 obtain able from ATCC 39195 and 39196 , are produced by combin ing a cloning vector and insert DNA isolated from a biologically pure culture of the bacterium Rhizobium japoni cum strain 122 DES. When either pHU1 or pHU2 is transfer red into a point mutant strain of Rhizobium japonicum, PJ17nal ATCC 39194 , that lacks the capacity for synthesis of a hydrogen gas oxidizing system Hup , the recipient strain PJ17nal, acquires the capacity for hydrogen gas oxidation. Similarly, transfer of the constructed replicons, pHU1 and pHU2, into another R. japonicum point mutant, PJ18nal ATCC 39193 , converts this strain into an H₂ oxidizing strain. Insert DNA in these replicons, therefore, contains genetic information essential for conversion of Hup strains of Rhizobium to Hup . Pure strains of nitrogen fixing microor ganisms containing the insert DNA, when administered to legumes, cause H₂ produced during nitrogen fixation to be oxidized and thereby increase the amount of energy avail able for nitrogen fixation.
