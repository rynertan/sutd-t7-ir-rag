# Drying wood pulp.

## Abstract
Bleached wood pulp is treated with a sulphite after bleaching and before or during flash drying to reduce the formation of nodules of agglomerated wood pulp fibres in the dried pulp, particularly in short fibre pulp from hard woods such as birch and eucalyptus. The sulphite is preferably added to the bleached pulp in the form of an aqueous solution of an alkali metal sulphite for example a 0.4 to 5 per cent by weight solution of sodium sulphite. The process of the invention is particularly suitable for drying pulp which is at an acid pH due to residual acids remaining on the pulp from the bleaching process, for example pulp bleached by treatment with chlorine dioxide.
