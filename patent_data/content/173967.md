# Microprogram load unit.

## Abstract
A microprogram load unit comprising a readable and writable microprogram memory 723 within a central pro cessor unit 7 for storing microprogram, a relatively low speed, readable and writable, nonvolatile memory unit 10 , and a readable and writable memory 81 with battery backup. It is determined whether data of the readable and writable memory 81 with backup has been lost or not when power is turned on. If data loss is not present, microprogram is read out of the readable and writable memory 81 with backup and written into the microprogram memory 723 . If data loss is present, microprogram is read out of the nonvolatile memory unit 10 and is written into the microprogram memory 723 .
