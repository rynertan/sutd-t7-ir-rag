## Description
The present invention relates to the fast release solid preparation comprising dihydropyridine A compound isopropyl 6 cyano 5 methoxycarbonyl 2 methyl 4 3 nitrophenyl l,4 dihydropyridine 3 carboxylate , which is represented by the following chemical formula Dihydropyridine A compound shows vasodilating activities such as coronary vasodilating activity or hypotensive activity and hence is useful for the treatment of coronary vascular diseases such as cardiac incompetence, angina pectoris, or myocardial infarction, as well as hypertension. DE A 3 013 839 discloses a process for the preparation of an activated pharmaceutical composition, which comprises dispersing the drug in water in the presence of a water soluble polymer and then removing the water a composition consisting of finely divided particles of the drug coated with the water soluble polymer is obtained. JP A 81 68619 discloses a solid preparation containing nifedipine in a mixture with hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose or methyl cellulose. However, when orally administered, the ratio of the absorption of dihydropyridine A compound into blood to its dose is insufficient owing to its sparing solubility in water practically insoluble and so dihydropyridine A compound has the disadvantage of its poor bioavailability. The inventors of the present invention have discovered that said disadvantage could be overcome by dispensing dihydropyridine A compound with hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, a water soluble polymer, to prepare a solid dispersion composition and completed the present invention. The present invention is explained in more detail in the following. The solid dispersion composition of the present invention can be prepared, by reacting dihydropyridine A compound with hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, for example, by dissolving dihydropyridine A compound in a suitable organic solvent, adding the water soluble polymer hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, to the resultant solution to prepare a homogeneous suspension, and then evaporating the organic solvent according to the conventional manner. The organic solvents to be used in this procedure are not restrictive and any solvent, wherein dihydropyridine A compound can be dissolved, can be used. Suitable examples of said solvent may include chloroform, methylene chloride, acetone, ethyl acetate, or alcohol e.g. methanol, ethanol, etc. . Hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose is one of the water soluble polymers and it is used to disperse dihydropyridine A compound to form a solid dispersion composition. The quantity of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose to be used is not restrictive and any quantity, by which dihydropyridine A compound can be dispersed, can be used preferably three to seven times as much as dihydropyridine A compound by weight are used. The solid dispersion composition of the present invention prepared by aforesaid procedure can be used by itself as fast release solid preparation and may be converted into various dosage forms such as powders, fine granules, granules, or tablets, according to the conventional manner. If desired, coloring agents, sweetening agents, flavouring agents, diluents e.g. sucrose, lactose, starch, crystalline cellulose, low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, synthetic aluminium silicate, or a lubricant e.g. magnesium stearate, may be dispensed with said solid dispersion composition. The solid dispersion composition and the various preparations of the present invention, which are prepared by optionally converting said solid dispersion composition into various dosage forms as mentioned above, have remarkably improved solubility and absorptivity into blood in comparison with bulk dihydropyridine A compound. If desired, in order to enhance the stability, add a beauty, smooth the surface, improve the ease of the administration and the like, the solid dispersion composition as prepared above can be used, for example, as a film coated tablet. Said film coated tablet can be prepared by coating the aforementioned tablet according to the conventional method, wherein the coating layer may include hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. To show the usefulness of the fast release solid preparation of the present invention, the test results are explained as follows. The tests were carried out according to the method 2 paddle method of the dissolution test in The Pharmacopoeia of Japan tenth edition using water as test solution the dissolution rate after l5 minutes from the beginning of each dissolution test was measured. From the results of the dissolution test, it turned out that any solid preparation comprising the solid dispersion composition of dihydropyridine A compound exhibited extremely good dissolution velocity. The amount of tablets equivalent to l0 mg of dihydropyridine A compound i.e. 5 tablets of Test Sample l and l tablet of Test Sample 2 was orally administered to six beagle dogs 8 l2 kg , which had been withheld from any food overnight in a crossover design. The plasma concentration of dihydropyridine A compound was determined by gas chromatography with ECD at 0.5, l, 2, 4, 6, 8, l0, l2 and 24 hours after administration. The plasma concentration at each time, the maximum plasma concentration C max and the area under the plasma concentration time curve AUC in each case of Test Sample l and Test Sample 2 are shown in the following table. Each value is represented by the mean value standard error for six beagle dogs. As is clear from the table, with respect to both the maximum plasma concentration and the area under the plasma concentration time curve, Test Sample l was proved to be significantly superior to Test Sample 2 . Namely, it turned out that by dispensing dihydropyridine A compound with hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose to form a solid dispersion composition, the absorptivity of dihydropyridine A compound into blood was remarkably improved and its bioavailability was extremely enhanced. The present invention is explained according to the following Examples. Dihydropyridine A compound l00 g was dissolved in anhydrous ethanol 5 ℓ and then hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose 500 g was added thereto to prepare a suspension. Then the organic solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to give a solid dispersion composition. To a suspension of dihydropyridine A compound l00 g and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose 500 g in anhydrous ethanol 5 ℓ was added sucrose 9.4 kg and the resultant mixture was stirred. Then the organic solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to give a solid dispersion composition. This solid dispersion composition was converted into fine granules by the conventional method. To a suspension of dihydropyridine A compound l00 g , and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose 500 g in anhydrous ethanol 5 ℓ were added lactose 6.87 kg and low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose l.5 kg and the resultant mixture was stirred and then the organic solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to give a solid dispersion composition. After the resultant solid dispersion composition was converted into granules by the conventional method, the granules were converted with magnesium stearate 30 g into tablets by the conventional method, each weight of which was l80 mg. Each tablet given in Example 3 was film coated by the conventional method with a coating layer consisting of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose 5.l mg , titanium dioxide l.6 mg , polyethylene glycol 6000 0.8 mg , talc 0.4 mg and iron oxide yellow 0.l mg , to give a film coated tablet containing dihydropyridine A compound.
