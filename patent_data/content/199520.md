# GRAVURE PRINTING PRESS AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURING THE SAME

## Abstract
A printing press comprises a rotatable cylindrical surface 6 carrying a gravure printing image and ink is applied to the surface by an inking unit comprising a pressurised ink duct. The ink duct is bounded by the surface 6 , a doctor blade 12 and a sealing member 11 . Ink is supplied to the duct under pressure from a source and excess ink is returned to the source. The image may be on a plate mounted on a plate cylinder 6 in a readily removable manner. The press may be produced by conversion of a letterpress printing machine for newspaper production.
