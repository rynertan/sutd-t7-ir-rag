# A surgically implantable device and stepping motor apparatus which may be used therein.

## Abstract
The described surgically implantable device has a step ping motor that can be isolated physically from electrical power sources and powered by the influence of a magnetic field ap plied from outside the body. The stepping motor includes a rotor and one or more stator elements, the stator elements being composed of magnetically soft and permeable material shaped and positioned with respect to the rotor so that when magnetized under the influence of the external field the stator elements strengthen and orient the magnetic field in their vicin ities so as to cause movement of the rotor. The stepping motor may be used in a surgically implantable shunt valve in which the popping pressure is adjusted in finite increments by appli cation of the external magnetic field.
