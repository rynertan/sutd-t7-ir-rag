# Vocalising apparatus for a speaking doll.

## Abstract
A speaking doll 10 which has a synthesizer for pro ducing speech sounds. The synthesizer is controlled by a digital controller having a memory which stores information presenting a vocabulary of infant like sounds. A motion detector activates the controller so as to cause the syn thesizer to produce a pattern of sound simulating happy infant sounds when the doll is moved and when it is cudd led, and fussing or crying sounds when it is thereafter not moved for a time. The electronic apparatus is shut down if the doll is left unmoved for a time after it no longer emits the fussing sounds but is automatically activated when again it is moved.
