# Method of achieving uniform shrinkage in a laminated planar green ceramic substrate during sintering and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
A method of achieving uniform shrinkage of a laminat ed green ceramic substrate 12 during sintering is dis closed, wherein the substrate 12 is placed on a flat, relatively thick plate 10 of refractory material such as molybdenum, tantalum or tungsten or alloys thereof with the flat plate 10 provided with a thin surface coating layer 18 of a ceramic material, and heating the substrate 12 to a sintering temperature and maintaining the tem perature for a time sufficient to sinter the substrate 12 . Furthermore, a setter plate 10 for supporting a pla nar green ceramic substrate 12 during the sintering operation is disclosed. The setter plate 10 is made of a refractory material and provided with a thin ceramic coating 18 on at least the top surface.
