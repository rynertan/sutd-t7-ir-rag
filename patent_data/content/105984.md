## Description
AROMATIC FORMALDEHYDE CONDErISATIQN POLYMERS AS DENTALPLAQUE BARRIERSTechnical FieldThis invention relates to oral hygiene compositions and methods using such compositions to prevent attachment of bacteria to teeth. More particularly, it relates to certain sulfonated and carboxylated polymeric materials that have been found useful in inhibiting the agglutination of oral microbes on teeth.Background ArtThe prevention of the depositibn of dental plaque on teeth is a highly desired result. Dental plaque results when cariogenic bacteria aggregate in colonies on the surface of teeth and form a tenacious deposit thereon. The presence of plaque on teeth is believed to be a precursor to development of dental caries and periodontal disease.While many attempts have been made to control the effects of cariogenic bacteria and the dental plaque they produce, for example, fluoride, flossing, brushing, etc., treatments, these are typically directed to either counteracting the secondary effects of plaque on the teeth and gums, or to the removal of plaque that is already formed on and adhering to the teeth and surrounding tissue. Such treatments are not, however, entirely successful, and must be supplemented with periodic treatment by dental professionals. To date, there is no commercially feasible home treatment method for preventing the formation of plaque or its adhesion to teeth.Condensation polymers of formaldehyde with naphthalene sulfonic acid are well known in commerce. They generally are of relatively low molecular weight, of the order of between about 500 and 5,000, typically about 2,000. Their sodium salts are commonly used as dispersants for pigments and other particles in aqueous media. Typical applications include latex paints, agricultural chemical formulations, pesticides and paper coatings. These materials are available commercially under the TAMOL trademark fromRohm Haas Company and under the LOMAR trademark from theProcess Chemical Division of Diamond Shamrock ChemicalCompany. To our knowledge, they have not been used in any compositions for treatment of the oral cavity or teeth.The InventionCertain hydrophilic carboxylic acid and carboxylic salt derivatives and sulfonic acid and sulfonic acid salt derivatives of certain aromatic formaldehyde condensation polymers have been synthesized. These polymers inhibit the deposition of dental plaque onto human teeth. These hydrophilic polymeric sulfonates and carboxylates have good film forming characteristics and, accordingly, are applied to teeth from various dentifrice formulations, mouth rinses, or other oral hygiene procedures. The anionic sulfonate and carboxylate polymers are substantially soluble in water or water organic solvent vehicles, primarily because of the relatively high degree of sulfonation and carboxylation achieved during preparation of these derivatives.While the mechanism of action of the hydrophilic polymeric films in retarding plaque deposition is not known with absolute certainty, it is presumed that the films of anionically charged polymers deposited on teeth effect a mutual repulsion between the negatively charged polymer film and the negatively charged microorganisms in oral fluids responsible for plaque generation. For example, when powdered human dental enamel is dispersed in the aqueous media ,containing salts of the polymeric sulfonates, a substantially negative surface charge is imparted to the enamel particles, as determined by zeta potential measurements. The sulfonated polymers of this invention are especially effective as components of dentifrices and other oral hygiene preparations in reducing dental plaque deposition on teeth.The hydrophilic, polymeric sulfonates found useful for dental plaque control in accordance with the present invention are essentially sulfonated derivatives of formaldehyde condensation polymers of certain aromatic compounds wherein the repeating unit of the polymer is selected from the group consisting of structure A , structure B structure C , structure D , structure E ,EMI3.1 and structure B EMI4.1 wherein R1 and R2 are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, linear or branched alkyl of up to 20 carbon atoms, alkoxy of 1 20 carbon atoms, fluorine, chlorine, and bromine, provided, however, that in structure B R1 and R2 cannot both be hydrogen R3 is hydrogen or an alkoxy group of up to 20 carbons X is a linkage selected from the group consisting of a direct covalent bond between the aromatic rings, a lower alkylene of 1 to 5 carbon atoms, a lower alkylidene having 2 to 5 carbon atoms, oxygen, sulfur, and O CH2 nO, where n is an integer from 2 to 20 p is from about 0.4 to about 1.2, preferably about 1 , the sum of q and r is between about 0.8 and about 2.4 preferably from about 1 to about 2 s is from about 0.4 to about 1.4 and M is selected from the group consisting of lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, aluminum, hydrogen, ammonium and substituted ammonium ions derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic amines. The zinc salts are particularly preferred.In general, the metal and ammonium salts are preferred over the free sulfonic acid derivatives because of their higher water solubility and lower degree of acidity closer to neutrality , thereby favoring their use in oral hygiene formulations for dental plaque control.With respect to structure F , while the naphthalene ring is believed to be monosulfonated primarily in the 2position as shown, there may be some of the 1 isomer as well.EMI4.2 The formaldehyde polymers of structures E through F that are sulfonated to form the plaque barriers of this invention are preferably prepared by the acid catalyzed condensation of aqueous 37t formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde with selected aromatic compounds under standard conditions reported in the literature and reviewed extensively in the text by J. F. Walker, Formaldehyde ,R. E. Krieger Publishing Co., Third Edition, 1975. By. selecting aromatic compounds of varied structure, condensation reactions with formaldehyde can afford a wide variety of aromatic formaldehyde polymers, having generalized structure I , wherein the unsulfonated aromatic moiety,Ar, corresponds to the aromatic structures in the repeating units of structures A through F of the sulfonated polymers defined above.EMI5.1 Typical examples of aromatic compounds which can be utilized for preparation of the formaldehyde polymers of general structure A through E are toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, propylbenzene, isopropylbenzene, butylbenzene, tertiary butylbenzene, octylbenzene, nonylbenzene, dodecylbenzene, octadecylbenzene, anisole, m chloroanisole, diphenyl, diphenylmethane, 2,2 diphenylpropane, 1,2diphenyl ethane bibenzyl , 1,5 diphenylpentane, diphenyl ether, diphenyl sulfide, 2,6 dimethylnaphthalene, nonylnaphthalene, l chloronaphthalene 1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalene tetralin l methoxy 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro naphthalene l dodecyloxy 1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalene acenaphthalene 1,2 bis phenoxy ethane 1,6bis phenoxy hexane and 1,12 bis phenoxy dodecane. As indicated in structures A F , the exact position or orientation of the methylene CH2 linkages on the aromatic rings is not known and is generally recognized as being complex and varied. It is well understood that some of the formaldehyde linkages may not be solely of the CH2 type but can also involve some extended units, such as CHzOCH2 and CH2 OCH2 nOCH2, or other possibilities cf. Walker, supra .However, despite these uncertainties, NMR data on the unsulfonated precursors as well as the sulfonated formaldehyde polymers of this invention indicated that the formaldehyde linkages consist essentially of the methylene linkage depicted in structures A F . The molecular weights of the unsulfonated polymers of structures A E were generally in the 20005000 molecular weight range, as established by viscosityaverage and weight average molecular weight light scattering measurements.The formaldehyde polymers are prepared by heating approximately equimolar quantities of formaldehyde and .the selected aromatic compound in an inert solvent, in the presence of an acid catalyst such as sulfuric acid, ptoluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, or perchloric acid, for several hours. Depending on the nature of the formaldehyde polymer, the latter precipiates from the reaction mixture either directly on cooling to room temperature or upon quenching in water. The preferred solvent for the reaction is acetic acid, a solvent known to favor formation of polymers having oxygen free linkages Walker, supra, p. 439 , such as those represented by structure I .The sulfonated formaldehyde polymers of structures A through E of this invention have a molecular weight of about 500 to 10,000, preferably about 2,000 to 5,000.They are substantially soluble in water or mixed solvents comprising water and an organic solvent miscible therewith generally at least 1 w w . The degree of sulfonation D.S. , defined herein as the average number of sulfonate or sulfonic acid groups per repeat unit of the polymeric structure, is an important variable which has a significant effect on the extent of dental plaque deposition.in structure F , the commercially available sulfonated polymers used in this invention are understood to be prepared by condensation of formaldehyde with naphthalene sulfonic acid and therefore have a degree of sulfonation of essentially 1. However, the present invention is not restricted to the use of these commercially available polymers, but includes analogous formaldehydeYnaphthalene condensation products wherein the degree of sulfonation is in the range of from about 0.4 to about 1.4. These can be depicted as having structure F ,EMI7.1 wherein M is a cation as defined above and the subscript s has a value of from about 0.4 to about 1.4.The polymers of structure F of this invention having aD.S. substantially different from 1 are generally prepared by aromatic sulfonation of naphthalene formaldehyde condensation polymer precursors.The naphthalene formaldehyde polymer precursors of structure F are prepared by heating approximately equimolar quantities of formaldehyde and naphthalene in an inert solvent, in the presence of an acid catalyst such as sulfuric acid, toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, or perchloric acid, for several hours. The preferred solvent for the reaction is acetic acid. Preferred sulfonation agents for preparing the sulfonated polymeric barriers of this invention are anhydrous sulfur trioxide, triethyl phosphate TEP complexes of sulfur trioxide, and chlorosulfonic acid. Due to the high reactivity of sulfur trioxide and its potent dehydration properties, sulfonation reactions with sulfur trioxide sometimes result in formation of highly insoluble polymer dispersions due to crosslinking caused by inter polymer chain sulfone formation In these situations, it is found preferable to moderate the sulfonation reactivity by utilization of the sulfur trioxide complexes with triethyl phospate TEP , which minimize or essentially eliminate formation of crosslinked by products cf. A. F. Turbak,Ind. Eng. Chem., Prod. R , 1, 275 1962 U.S. 3,072,619 January 8, 1963 A. F. Turbak and A. Noshay, U.S.3,206,492 September 14, 1965 N. H. Canter, U.S.3,642,728 February 15, 1972 A. Noshay and L. M.Robeson, J. Applied Polymer Science, 20, 1885 1.976 1. In some instances where it is difficult to effect sulfonation under milder conditions with the complexes, sulfonation with sulfur trioxide alone or chlorosulfonic acid is more effective.Sulfonations are effected in solvents such as methylene chloride, l,2 dichloroethane, and chloroform, since these are generally good solvents for the starting aromatic polymer and poor solvents for the sulfonated polymer. In those instances where the product is soluble in the reaction medium and does not precipitate, the sulfonated polymer is isolated by removing the solvent and converted to well defined solids by either trituration or slurrying with an appropriate non solvent.Temperature control of the sulfonation reaction with sulfur trioxide and its complexes with TEP is not very critical. Acceptable results are obtained over a temperature range of 20 C to 400C range. Sulfonations are generally effected at ambient room temperatures, since the sulfona tion exotherm is very mild and rarely results in temperature increases beyond 350C.Typical impurities in the sulfonated polymer are small amounts of unreacted polymer, excess sulfonation agent as sulfuric acid , and residual triethyl phosphate which are occluded in the solid polymer. Substantial purification can be effected by slurrying the polymeric sulfonic acid derivatives in non solvents there for, such as the halocarbons. Removal of the free sulfuric acid is difficult, since it complexes strongly with the polymeric product.Diethyl ether is an exceptionally good complexing agent for sulfuric acid and effectively removed this contaminant when freshly isolated polymeric solids are slurried in the ether and filtered. Other effective additives for sulfuric acid removal are halocarbon solvent blends with diethyl ether and other oxygenated solvents, such as ethyl acetate and acetone. The sulfuric acid, if not removed, results in contamination of the metal salts with, e.g. sodium sulfate, in the case where the sodium sulfonate polymer is produced. The preferred process for purification of the sulfonated polymers, particularly highly water soluble types, is by dialysis in membrane tubes or hollow fiber dialyzing units having a molecular weight cut off well below the molecular weight of the polymer. Dialysis removes all of the low molecular impurities, triethyl phosphate, and inorganic salts. High purity polymers are isolated as solids by freeze drying or spray drying the dialyzed polymer solution.The D.S. of the sulfonated polymers can be varied by adjusting the molar ratio of sulfonating agent to polymer. In preparing the sulfpnated polymers of this invention, the exact position of sulfonation on the aromatic rings is not known with certainty, nor is it considered important in the practice of this invention.The D.S. of the formaldehyde polymers, either as their sulfonic acid or sulonate salt derivatives, can be determined by any of several methods a NMR analysis, b elemental analysis for sulfur to carbon ratio determination, c direct titration of the sulfonic acid derivative with standard sodium hydroxide to obtain the milliequivalents of sulfonic acid groups per gram of sample, a value approximately equivalent to the ion exchange capacity of the sulfonated polymer, or d atomic absorption assay for the metal content of carefully purified samples of the sulfonated salts.The alkali metal salts of the sulfonated polymers are conveniently prepared by neutralization of a water or alcohol solution of the polymeric sulfonic acid derivative with alkali metal hydroxide solutions to the potentiome tric endpoint. The salts are recovered by filtration, solvent stripping, or freeze drying, depending on the type of solvent used and whether the salt precipitates directly from the solvent media. Alternatively, sulfonate salts can be prepared by addition of at least stoichiometric quantities of an alkali metal oxide, carbonate, acetate, chloride, nitrate, or sulfate to the sulfonic acid derivative. The salts either precipitate directly and are collected, or they are isolated after solvent stripping.Purification of the sulfonate salt by dialysis is the preferred procedure for the more highly water soluble salts. Multivalent metal salts, such as calcium, magnesium, zinc, and aluminum salts, of the sulfonated polymers are prepared by methods similar to those described above. In an alternate procedure, multivalent metal salts can be prepared by an ion exchange reaction between the multivalent ion and either the free sulfonic acid or an alkali metal sulfonate derivative of the polymer. The neutralization and other salt forming reactions described above are essentially ion exchange reactions, as typified by the following equations, where P represents the polymer chain EMI11.1 Ammonium salts of the sulfonic acid polymer can be prepared by direct addition of ammonia or a primary, secondary, or tertiary organic amine.The hydrophilic, polymeric carboxylates of structure G , found useful for dental plaque control in accordance with the present invention are essentially carboxylic acid salt derivatives of formaldehyde condensation polymers of certain naphthalene compounds wherein the repeating unit of the polymer has the structure G ,EMI11.2 wherein R4 is selected from the group consisting of COOM and CHzCOOM including mixtures of these two substituents , and M is selected from the group consisting of lithium, sodium and potassium.The free acids wherein M is hydrogen , while too insoluble in aqueous media to be useful as barrier agents in the compositions of this invention, are new compositions of matter that are readily converted to the above salts by methods well known to those skilled in the art and are, therefore, considered to be within the scope of this invention as useful precursors of the salts used as barrier agents in the compositions and method of this invention.The formaldehyde polymers of structure G of this invention are preferably prepared by the acid catalyzed condensat ion of aqueous 37 formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde with naphthoic acid and or naphthylacetic acid under standard conditions reported in the literature for other compounds and reviewed extensively in the text byJ.F. Walker, Formaldehyde , R.E. Krieger Publishing Co.,Third Edition, 1975. The resultant polymers, having repeating units of structure G , wherein M is hydrogen, are converted to their alkali metal salts by neutralization or ion exchange reactions.Typical naphthalene compounds which can be utilized for preparation o f the formaldehyde polymers of structure G of this invention are l naphthoic acid, 2 naphthoic acid, l naphthylacetic acid, and 2 naphthylacetic acid. The exact position or orientation of the methylene CH2 linkages on the aromatic rings is not known and is generally recognized as being complex and varied. It is well understood that some of the formaldehyde linkages may not be solely of the CH2 type but can also involve some extended units, such as CH2OCHz and CH OCH nOCH2, or other possibilities cf. Walker, supra . However, despite these uncertainties, NMR data on the carboxylated formaldehyde polymers of this invention indicate that the formaldehyde linkages consist essentially of the methylene linkage depicted in structure G .The formaldehyde polymers of structure G are prepared by heating approximately equimolar quantities of formaldehyde and the selected naphthalene compounds in an inert solvent, in the presence of an acid catalyst such as sulfuric acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, or perchloric acid, for several hours. Depending on the nature of the formaldehyde polymer, the latter precipitates from the reaction mixture either directly on cooling to room temperature or upon quenching in water.The preferred solvent for the reaction is acetic acid, a solvent known to favor formation of polymers having oxygen f ee linkages Walker, supra, p.439 , such as those of the present invention.The alkali metal salts of the carboxylated polymers of structure C of this invention are conveniently prepared by neutralization of a water or alcohol solution of the polymeric carboxylic acid derivative with alkali metal hydroxide solutions to the potentiometric endpoint. The salts are recovered by filtration, solvent stripping, or freeze drying, depending on the type of solvent used and whether the s alt precipitates directly from the solvent media. Alternatively, carboxylic acid salts can be prepared by addition of at least stoichiometric quantities of an alkali metal oxide, carbonate, acetate, chloride, nitrate, or sulfate to the carboxylic acid polymer. The salts either precipitate directly and are collected, or they are isolated after solvent stripping. Purification of the carboxylate salt by dialysis is the preferred procedure for the more highly water soluble salts.For testing the formaldehyde polymers of this invention, the in vitro test procedure we have employed begins with growth of plaque in small jars containing sterilized trypticase media that has been supplemented with sucrose.Typically, ten jars are individually inoculated with 0.5 ml of unpooled freshly collected human plaque from 10 subjects. In a control series, a presterilized glass slide or an extracted human tooth is inserted into each jar. In the test series, the tooth or glass slide is pretreated with a 1 solution of the test compound dissolved in water or other vehicle , allowed to dry in order to deposit a thin film of the compound on the surface, and the glass slide or tooth placed in the growth media. The jars are incubated under anaerobic conditions for two days at 370 C. The tooth or glass slide is removed, air dried, and stained with 0.15 FD num 3 red dye solution to reveal the accumulated plaque deposits. The tooth or glass slide is scored for plaque density on a 0 to 5 scale.Plaque barrier activity is reported as the of average plaque reduction, as compared to appropriate controls for ten subjects.The effect of the degree of sulfonation D.S. of the formaldehyde polymers of structures A through E of this invention on their plaque barrier properties is shown in Table 1, which illustrates the necessity of achieving a certain minimal D.S. value in order to develop adequate plaque barrier properties. For example, acceptable reductions in the deposition of plaque are obtained when the D.S. of sulfonated polymers of structures A through D is at least about 0.4. In sulfonated polymers of structure E , where there are two phenyl rings in each repeat unit, the D.S. should average at least about 0.8 per repeat unit or about 0.4 per phenyl ring.As shown by the in vitro test results reported in Table 2, the sulfonated naphthalene formaldehyde polymers of structure F of this invention are highly effective in reducing the deposition of plaque. These polymers have a molecular weight in the range of from about 500 to about 5,000, preferably of the order of 2,000 to 3,000.The alkali metal salts of the formaldehyde polymers of naphthoic and naphthylacetic acids of structure G of this invention are highly effective in reducing the deposition of plaque when tested by this in vitro test procedure. For example, the sodium salts of the formaldehyde polymers of l naphthoic acid and l naphthylacetic acid showed plaque reductions of 338 and 57 , respectively.The formaldehyde polymers of structure G of this inven tion have a molecular weight of about 500 to about 10,000, preferably about 2,000 to 5,000. They are substantially soluble in water or mixed solvents comprising water and an organic solvent miscible therewith generally at least 1 w w .

After heating and stirring at 111 116 C for two hours, the suspension of slightly,gummy solids was cooled to room temperature and the reaction contents poured into 500 ml ice water mixture. The solids were filtered, washed with water, and air dried. The polymer solids were dissolved in 70 ml. tetrahydrofuran and the solution added slowly to 700 ml. methanol with vigorous stirring to re precipitate the purified polymer.The solids were collected, washed with methanol, and the precipitation procedure from tetrahydrofuran methanol repeated. The yield of the naphthalene formaldehyde polymer, showing a softening point of about 1450 C, was 25.0g. The weight average molecular weight, determined by light scattering in chloroform at room temperature, was 2300 100. Example 10Sulfonation of Naphthalene Formaldehyde PolymerA solution of 14.lg of the naphthalene formaldehyde polymer, prepared as in Example 9, in 70 ml. methylene chloride was stirred and maintained at 23 to 330C during the addition of a solution of 5.2 ml. 10.0g, 0.125 mole liquid sulfur trioxide in 80 ml. methylene chloride.After the addition period of 40 minutes, the resultant suspension of solids was stirred another one hour at the ambient temperature. The blue colored solids were filtered, washed with methylene chloride and ether, and dried to afford 21.2g of the sulfonic acid derivative of the polymer as fine, blue solids.Titration of an accurately weighed sample 2.8081g of the derivative in methanol with standard sodium hydroxide showed 3.87 milliequivalents gram of sulfonic acid functionality, equivalent to a degree of sulfonation D.S,. of 0.8. Removal of the solvent from the neutralized solution gave 2.7g of the sodium sulfonate derivative as a dark orange, water soluble powder.A solution of 10.0g 38.7 meq. SO3H of the sulfonic acid derivative of the polymer in 60 ml. water was treated with a solution of 4.3g 38.7 meq. zinc acetate dihydrate in 20 ml. water, resulting in a pH increase from 1.7 to 3.9 and a color change from brown green to brown orange.The solution was stripped free of water under reduced pressure. The residue was taken up in 150 ml. water, centrifuged to clarify the solution, and the centrifugate stripped free of water under reduced pressure to afford 10.lug of the zinc sulfonate salt, an orange powder.Dialysis of a 10 aqueous solution of the zinc sulfonate polymer in a Spectropor 6 membrane tube molecular weight cutoff 2,000 gave an 88 recovery of purified zinc salt.Example 11Sodium Salt of l Naphthoic Acid Formaldehyde PolymerA solution of 17.2g 0.100 mole l naphthoic acid and 8.lg 0.100 mole 37 formaldehyde in 85 ml. glacial acetic acid was stirred and maintained at a temperature of 90 110 C. during addition of 5.6 ml. 0.100 mole 96 sulfuric acid over 10 minutes. The solution was maintained at 1100C for another 24 hours, during which time the solution became progressively darker in color and some solids appeared. On cooling to 500 C, heavy precipitation of white solids occurred. Addition of 150 ml. water produced a heavier deposition of solids which was filtered, washed with water, and dried.The solids were slurried in boiling toluene, filtered hot, and dried to afford ll.lg of the l naphthoic acid formaldehyde polymer showing a softening point of about 220 C. A solution of 1.8068g of the l naphthoic acid polymer in 40 ml. methanol was neutralized from pH 25 to pH 8.0 with 16.6 ml. 0.512 N. methanolic sodium hydroxide. The neutralization equivalent value was 212.6. Removal of the solvent from the neutralized solution gave l.9g of the sodium salt of the polymer which was soluble in water and methanol.Example 12Sodium Salt of l Naphthylacetic Ac id Formaldehyde PolymerInto a flask was charged l8.6g 0.100 mole l naphthylacetic acid, 93 ml. glacial acetic acid, and 8.lg 0.100 mole 37 formaldehyde. With stirring, 5.6 ml. 0.100 mole 96 sulfuric acid was added and the mixture heated at a gentle reflux 1100 C for about 21 hours. On cooling to room temperature and dilution with 200 ml. water, heavy deposition of solids took place. The polymeric solids were filtered, washed with water, re slurried in 200 ml.boiling water, and filtered hot. The moist solids were dried in vacuo at 600C to give 17.3g of the l naphthylacetic acid formaldehyde polymer, a tan colored powder.A solution of 2.0251g of the polymer was prepared in a mixture of 40 ml. acetone and 40 ml. tetrahydrofuran and neutralized to pH 7.7 with 20.6 ml 0.512 N methanolic sodium hydroxide solution. The sodium salt of the polymer precipitated and was filtered, washed with acetone, and dried. The neutralization equivalent value was 192 and in good agreement with the theoretical value of 198 for a 1 1 naphthylacetic acid formaldehyde condensation polymer. Example 13Sodium Salt of 2 Naphthoic Acid Formaldehyde Polymer using the same procedure as described in Example 11, 2naphthoic acid and 37 formaldehyde are reacted to afford the 2 naphthoic acid formaldehyde polymer, which is then neutralized with sodium hydroxide to give the water soluble, polymeric sodium salt.Example 14Potassium Salt of 2 Naphthylacetic Acid FormaldehydePolymerIn a manner similar to that described in Example 12, 2naphthylacetic acid is converted to the corresponding formaldehyde polymer of structure A which, after neutralization with methanolic potassium hydroxide, affords the potassium salt.The plaque barrier oral compositions of this invention may comprise any conventional pharmaceutically acceptable oral hygiene formulation that contains and is compatible with an effective amount of a plaque barrier agent as defined herein. Such formulations include, for example, mouthwashes, rinses, irrigating solutions, nonabrasive gel dentifrices, denture cleansers, coated dental floss and interdental stimulator coatings, chewing gums, lozenges, breath fresheners, foams and sprays.The plaque barrier agents may be present in these formulations in effective concentrations generally in the range of from about 0.05 weight percent to as much as 30 weight percent or the limit of compatibility with the vehicle.However, no advantage will be derived from concentrations in excess of about 20 weight percent. A preferred concentration range for the plaque barrier agents in the formulations of the invention is from about 0.5 to about 10 weight percent. A more preferred range is from about 2 to about 8 percent by weight, about 5 being the presently mbst preferred concentration in a nonabrasive gel vehicle.The pH of these plaque barrier preparations should be between pH 5.0 and 10.0, preferably between pH 5.0 and 8.0, more preferably between about pH 6.0 and 7.5. Lower pH than 5.0 is undesirable because of the possible enhancement of enamel demineralization.Suitable conventional pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles that can be employed with the plaque barrier agents to prepare the barrier compositions of this invention may comprise water, ethanol such humectants as polypropylene glycol, glycerol and sorbitol such gelling agents as cellulose derivatives, for example, Methocel, carboxymethylcellulose CMC TMF and Klucel HF, polyoxypropylene polyoxyethylene block copolymers, for example, Pluronic F127, Pluronic F 108, Pluronic P 103, Pluronic P 104, Pluronic P 105, t and Pluronic P 123, colloidial magnesium aluminosilicate complexes such as Veegum, and mucoprotein thickening agents such as Carbopol 934 gel stabilizers such as the silicon dioxides, for example, Cab O Sil M5 and polyvinylprolidone sweeteners such as sodium saccharin preservatives such as citric acid, sodium benzoate, cetylpyridinium chloride, potassium sorbate, methyl and ethyl parabens detergents such as sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium cocomonoglyceride sulfonate, sodium lauryl sarcosinate and polyoxyethylene isohexadecyl ether Arlasolve 200 and approved colors and flavors. Anticaries fluoride compounds, such as sodium fluoride, can also be incorporated into the compositions 9f this invention.The following specific examples will serve further to illustrate the plaque barrier compositions of this invention.

Then the container is put into an ice bath. When the temperature reaches 60C, the gelling agent is added and the contents mixed slowly until the gelling agent is dissolved. Then the solution is heated to 700 C. Into a second container is added the glycerin. Then theCab O Sil M5 is sprinkled in with mixing. Then the plaque barrier agent is added and mixing continued to a smooth paste. The paste is then heated in a water bath with mixing to a temperature of 70 C. The contents of the first container are added to the second container and blended together until the batch is homogenous while maintaining a 70 C temperature. Then the flavoring is added, all mixing is stopped, and the formulation allowed to settle for approximately one hour. If necessary to remove air bubbles, overnight refrigeration may be employed.While any pharmaceutically acceptable gelling agent that is compatible with the plaque barrier agent may be employed, a presently preferred gelling agent is Pluronic F 127.These compositions are preferably employed from one to three times daily in a routine oral hygiene program to prevent the attachment of plaque to the teeth.Variations can, of course, be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.
