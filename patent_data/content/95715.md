# Extended play videodisc.

## Abstract
An extended play videodisc and a method and apparatus for playing it. The disc carries every m th segment of a video program and the segments are repeated m times to approxi mate the original program. Prior art extended play discs have contained every other frame or every third frame of video, but the repeating of an entire frame results in poor motion repro duction and flickering scene transitions. The present invention preferably includes the repeating of a field of video an odd number of times. The fields are preferably arranged in order on the disc with n fields per revolution, the disc being rotated such that a new field is read every one and 1 n th revolution of the disc. The new segment is preferably read during the final repeating of the previous segment.
