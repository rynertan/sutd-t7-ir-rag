Pharmacological evaluationAmong the compounds described in EP A1 0030526, the compound N n propyl 3 3 hydroxyphenyl piperidine, hereinafter referred to as 3 PPP, was presented in greatest detail.It was shown that 3 PPP and its congeners are capable of inhibiting the physiological activity of central dopaminergic .neurons by activating a subpopulation of dopaminergic receptors presumably located on the dopaminergic neuron itself, i.e. presynaptic receptors or autoreceptors. The effect proved to be selective, in that no concomitant activation of the classical postsynaptic dopaminergic receptors could be detected.These observations were made on racemic mixtures. The two enantiomers of 3 PPP have now been tested separately.Surprisingly the levorotatory enantiomer, 3 PPP, not only was capable of activating the presynaptic dopaminergic receptors autoreceptors but concomitantly reduced the sensitivity of the postsynaptic dopaminergic receptors to dopaminergic agonists. By the combined activation of presynaptic receptors and partial blockade of postsynaptic receptors thE inhibitory action on dopaminergic neurotransmission will be stronger than by either effect alone. In other words, the levorotatory enantiomer is superior to the racemic mixture as an inhibitor of dopaminergic neurotransmission by acting both presynaptically as an agonist and postsynaptically as an antagonist.The reason for the difference in pharmacological profile between the levorotatory enantiomer and the racemic mixture has been clarified the dextrorotatory enantiomer was found to be a dopaminergic receptor agonist by activating both the presynaptic and the postsynaptic receptors. Thus, the two enantiomers antagonize each other on the postsynaptic dopaminergic receptor. As a consequence, the racemic mixture will be active only own the presynaptic receptor autoreceptor . The pharmacological tests demonstrating the properties of the two enantiomers of 3 PPP are presented below.1. Evidence for presynaptic dopaminergic receptor autoreceptor agonist activity of both enantiomers of 3 PPP.Both enantiomers of 3 PPP cause a dose dependent decrease in spontaneous exploratory motor activity of rats. In maleSprague Dawley rats injected subcutaneously with either enantiomer of 3 PPP and 5 min later placed in Motron boxes for measurement of motor activity the number of counts during the first 30 min was recorded at doses between 0.053 and 64 mg kg. Both enantiomers cause a.decrease of locomotor activity to 30 40 a of control. However, the enantiomer causes a decrease only after doses between 0.25 and 4 mg kg s.c. After 8 mg kg there is no effect, and after 64 mg kg there is a significant increase to more than 200 t of control. In contrast, the enantiomer causes a decrease after all these doses, with no reversal of the effect after larger doses. In the dopaminergic neurotransmission L tyrosine is hydroxy lated to L dopa, which is decarboxylated to the transmitter substance dopamine. After inhibition of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase by means of 3 hydroxybenzylhydrazine HC1 NSD 1015 both enantiomers of 3 PPP cause a dose dependent decrease at doses between 0.053 and 64 mg kg in the formation of dopa in dopamine rich brain regions of rats pretreated with reserpine or gamma butyrolactone GBL . Pretreatment with GBL and probably also reserpine precludes thE influence of postsynaptic dopamine receptors on dopa formation and thus provides the opportunity to study the .inflsnce of presynaptic autoreceptors separately cf. Hjorth et al., Life Sci. Vol 28, pp. 1225 1238, 1981 . The effect of both enantiomers on dopa formation is blocked by the dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol. These findings provide strong evidence for stimulation of presynaptic dopamine receptors autoreceptors . In rats not pretreated with GBL or reserpine the two enan tiomers act differently on dopa formation at doses between 0.053 and 64 mg kg the form causes a decrease, whereas the form causes an increase in dopa formation in the striatum and no change in the limbic region. These changes in dopa formation are matched by corresponding changes in the levels of the dopamine metabolites 3,4 dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid and homovanillic acid. This differential action of.the two enantiomers will be commented below. 2. Evidence for postsynaptic dopaminergic receptor agonist activity of 3 PPP. In reserpine treated rats t 3 PPP causes a marked stimula tion of locomotor activity at doses between 0.25 and 64 mg kc The effect is blocked by haloperidol. These findings provide strong evidence for a stimulating action of 3 PPP on postsynaptic dopaminergic receptors. The form causes only a very weak stimulation of motor activity in reserpine pretreated rats, indicating virtual absence of stimulating action on postsynaptic dopaminergic receptors. 3. Evidence for postsynaptic dopaminergic receptor antagonist activity of 3 PPP. The locomotor stimulating action of the dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine is antagonized by 3 PPP. This effect is clearcut after a dose of 8 mg kg s.c. of 3 PPP. but not after 2 mg kg. Thus the postsynaptic receptor antagonist activity requires 2 large dose than the presynaptic receptor agonist activity, which is evident after doses,down to 0.25 mg kg. The abovementioned ability of 3 PPP to stimulate dopa formation and to raise dopamine metabolite levels in rat striatum provides further evidence for blockade of postsynaptic dopamine receptors, resulting in feedback mediated stimulation of dopaminergic neurons.Further, 3 PPP and racemic 3 PPP have been compared regarding antagonism of apomorphine induced locomotor stimulation. Either form of 3 PPP was injected subcutaneously in a dose of a mg kg 20 min and apomorphine in a dose of 1 mg kg subcutaneously 5 min before placing the rats in the Motron for 30 min. Shown are the counts per 30 min, means s.e.m. and number of experiments n . As demonstrated in Table 1 3 PPP antagonized said stimulation while the racemate did not. The form of 3 PPP has a striking antagonistic action against the locomotor stimulating activity of amphetamine. This effect is probably the result of the simul tenuous stimulation of presynaptic dopaminergic rEceptors and partial blockade of postsynaptic dopaminergic receptors. All the major antipsychotic agents in current use are potent amphetamine antagonists, and such activity is considered to be predictive of antipsychotic action.ConclusionThE compounds under consideration are centrally acting selective dopamine autoreceptor simulating agents, and thus of great clinical interest in the treatment of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia and a number of other disease states such as tardive dyskinesia, Huntington s chorea, alcoholism and drug abuse, said psychotic disorders and other disease states possibly being associated with a pathological increase in central dopamine transmission. Extrapyramidal motor disturbances of choreatic type are avoided with the compounds of the invention. As compared with the known racemates, the pure enantiomers of the invention have a better efficacy in the suggested treatment in having an unexpected postsynaptic dopamine antagonist activity in addition the presynaptic dopamine agonist activity.Table 1Antagonism of apomorphine induced locomotor stimulation.
