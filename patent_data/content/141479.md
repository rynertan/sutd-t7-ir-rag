# Brushless dc motor with improved starting.

## Abstract
A brushless DC motor of the kind that includes a relatively large rotor permanent magnet 14 magnetized radially in segments around its circumference to provide alternate segments oppositely magnetized has a stator 12 magnetic structure with two dissimilar pole pieces 46, 47 in flux conducting relation to a pair of windings. A first of the pole pieces 46 presents a face to the outer surface of the annular magnet across an air gap. A second pole piece 47 , which may be somewhat further from the outer surface of the annular magnet 14 , at the opposite end of the windings, presents only a norrow edge surface 62 facing generally in the direction of the magnet. The modified pole piece 80 is L shaped or U shaped, having one or two legs 82, 83 respectively, projecting from the coil support structure generally circumferentially with respect to the magnet. The legs 82, 83 taper towards their ends more remote from the coil 41 support structure and form broader upper and lower surfaces more nearly perpendicular the axis of magnet rotation than the narrow edge surface or surfaces facing the magnet across the air gap.
