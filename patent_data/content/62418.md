# PROPULSION UNIT PROTECTION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A sensing cage 22 is located around the propeller of a pendently mountable propulsion unit 9 , eg an out board motor, and arranged so that a blow delivered to the cage from below or in any lateral direction frees a detent means 15 to release energy stored in springs 11 disposed so as to raise the propulsion unit with respect to a support frame 1 . The springs are re energised when the propulsion unit is pushed down again by manual pressure. No replacement of parts is needed before redeploying the unit.
