# Variable frequency induction well logging method and apparatus.

## Abstract
Well logging methods and apparatus utilize variable fre quency induction and have an approximately constant vertical response function. The frequency of operation of a downhole coil array 10 is automatically selected to minimize propaga tion effects. These techniques permit an N point deconvolution at 16 of apparent formation conductivity to yield an approxi mation of the true conductivity of incremental layers of cylin drically symmetrical earth formations, including formations having adjacent layers of arbitrary thicknesses and con ductivities, which approximation may be recorded at 28 .
