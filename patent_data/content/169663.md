## Description
PREVENTION OF PLANT DAMAGE BY ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS This invention is concerned with the prevention of plant damage by environmental hazards. So called acid rain has received wide publicity over the past few years, and the counteraction of the effect on plants of acid materials in the atmosphere and of the effect of ultraviolet light, particularly in cases where one effect accentuates the other, is both ecologically sound and environmentally desirable.

The present invention is based on the discovery that coating substances of the above type can be used to reduce the damage to vegetation, particularly to the leaves of deciduous and evergreen trees and shrubs, resulting from exposure to toxic gases or particulate toxic material, the deposition on them of rain contaminated by acid, or other toxic contaminants either before or after these contaminants have been affected by ultraviolet light and or atmospheric ozone. Such contaminants include sulphurous and sulphuric acids, dissolved sulphur dioxide, nitrous and nitric acids, and other toxic gases and particulate matter produced from power stations, industrial plants and the exhaust fumes of cars and other motor vehicles.In the case of trees growing at high elevations the effect of ultraviolet light and ozone on such gases may be such as to substantially increase their toxic properties to vegetation. In accordance with the present invention, a method for the prevention or reduction of damage to vegetation by acidic and other toxic contamination in the atmosphere comprises applying to the vegetation a coating agent that may act as a protective preferentially unidirectionally permeable membrane allowing the vegetation to breathe but not to absorb toxic gases or atmospheric water and contaminants dissolved in it.Vegetation that can be protected in accordance with the invention includes trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants. The substance may be applied during growth or dormancy of the vegetation. During dormancy or other periods of restricted growth the coating material may be used at levels giving a higher degree of protection but giving a much greater reduction in the uptake of carbon dioxide and reduction in transpiration. The additives disclosed in U. K. Patent GB 2 030 452 B can be used in conjunction with the coating agent in order to encourage resistance to and or recovery from damage from the atmospheric pollutants mentioned.Such of those additives as are basic in character, for example the amino acids asparagine and glutamine, are of especial value in neutralizing the effects of acidity. Amino acids containing more than one amino group per carboxy group are particularly suitable. Other substances such as calcium or magnesium carbonate or hydroxide and other buffers and alkalis may be used to neutralize acidity and combined in the coating agent, but in the case of calcium compounds care is required in view of the lime hating nature of certain shrubs. The coating agent along with the additives described herein may also be used in conjunction with plant hormones synthetic or natural to counter senescence and other tissue degradation induced by atmospheric pollution.These may include 1,3 diphenylurea, N phenylmethyl 9 tetrahydro 2H pyran 2 yl 9H purin 6 amine, extracts of seaweed, and other natural plant extracts containing cytokinin activity. Such preparations may be applied by spraying from the ground but may more usefully be applied by spraying from aircraft. Because of the weakened condition of the vegetation it will be more susceptible to fungal and insect attack. It may therefore be beneficial to include an insecticide and or fungicide with the coating agent. The damage caused by such toxic gases or vapours to vegetation exposed to them may be exacerbated where the plant has suffered previous ultraviolet light damage or where initial damage by the said toxic gases or vapours results in damage by ultraviolet light that would otherwise not have taken place or would have been significantly less. Such ultraviolet light damage is likely to be more severe where the vegetation is exposed to high levels of ultraviolet irradiation, e.g. where it is growing at high altitudes. The coating agents described above, especially those based on pinenene, terpenes and di l E menthene and its polymers act to reduce ultraviolet light and hence may act as a sun screen or ultraviolet filter to the leaf. This effect may be further enhanced by adding to the coating material or using in its place a chemical known to screen out ultraviolet irradiation. Such chemicals include but are not limited to pine oils, oils of plants such as lemon, olive, coconut and jujuba substances such as borneol, limonene and terpineol cinnamic acid, hydroxy cinnamic acid and benzoic acid and the salts of these acids and pigments and substances that absorb strongly at wavelengths below 350 Angstroms 35m . Free radical formation from atmosphere pollutants is an additional hazard to plants. Photosynthetic electron flow reduces oxides of nitrogen to form a free radical, and this is converted back to the oxide of nitrogen, with concomitant formation of hydrogen peroxide, by re oxidation by molecular atmospheric oxygen. The hydrogen peroxide is the damaging agent and the reaction producing it can be very rapid, especially in bright sunshine. It can however be slowed by providing an alternative oxidation reduction system. Thus the use of oxidized glutathione GSSG will reoxidize the free radical to the original nitrogen oxide with formation of reduced glutathione GSH but no hydrogen peroxide is formed. One such system is the enzymic re oxidation of reduced glutathione in conjunction with nicotine adenine dinucleotide phosphate NADP , which may be stimulated by the use of an NADP precursor such as nicotinamide or nicotinic acid, and a further system is that of ascorbic acid dehydroascorbic acid catalysed by the enzyme ascorbic acid oxidase, which may be stimulated by the use of ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid is initially added and converted in the plant to dehydroascorbic acid 5 below.The reactions that take place with NO and GSSG are thus EMI7.1 tb NO SEP ion SEP light SEP reduced SEP free SEP radical SEP SEP O2 SEP I SEP tb reduced SEP free SEP radical SEP SEP O2 SEP SEP H20 SEP 2 SEP NO SEP ion SEP SEP H202 SEP 2 tb reduced SEP free SEP radical SEP GSSG SEP SEP NO SEP ion SEP SEP GSH SEP 3 tb GSH SEP SEP dehydroascorbic SEP acid SEP SEP ascorbic SEP acid SEP SEP GSSG SEP 4 tb Ascorbic SEP acid SEP oxygen SEP Dehydroascorbic SEP acid SEP 5 tb SEP ascorbic SEP acid tb SEP oxidase tb Thus the formation of hydrogen peroxide is slowed down and reaction 2 can be eliminated almost completely by using sufficient amounts of theGSSG and ascorbic acid. The following Example shows how coniferous trees may be protected for toxic acidic atmospheric pollutants by application of a coating in accordance with the invention. EXAMPLE Eight plants of each of the species sitka spruce Picea sitchensis ,Norway spruce Picea abies and red spruce Picea rubens , were divided randomly into two groups. Half the plants of each species were coated using a mixture containing water 1790 g , di l p menthene 180 g and alkyl phenol ethylene oxide condensate 30 g . Three days after coating, all 24 plants were placed in a single fumigation chamber in which the coated and uncoated plants were grown for two weeks in eight hour days at photon flux densities of 250 mole E. m ê s Ú P.A.R. with temperatures of 18 C 10 C day night. After one week the plants were exposed for 8 hours to 8 ppm SO2 for one light period and this exposure was repeated one week later. Results No visible injury occurred to the plants after the first day of exposure but needle blemishes developed gradually over the four days after the second exposure. The percentages of needles showing injury of any degree were counted. Four days after the second exposure at 8 ppm SO2 the mean numbers of needles damaged standard errors on the coated and uncoated plants were as follows sitka spruce uncoated 1.75 0.96 coated 0.25 0.504. red spruce uncoated 70 3.5 coated 2.25 0.509o Norway spruce uncoated 85 2.4 coated 2.75 1.26 These results indicate that damage is substantially reduced by application of a coating in accordance with the invention.
