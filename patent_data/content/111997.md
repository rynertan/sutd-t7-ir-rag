## Description
The present invention relates to novel substituted vinylcarboxylic acid derivatives which possess the action of inhibiting specifically the thromboxane A₂ TXA₂ synthetase. TXA₂ is a metabolite of arachidonic acid and has a platelet aggregating action. Therefore, it has been known that excessive production of TXA₂ in the body causes various ischemic disorders in the heart, kidney and brain due to occlusion or constriction of a blood vessel. The present inventors conducted research on the synthesis of, and investigation into, materials exhibiting an inhibitory action against the TXA₂ synthetase and, as a result, found a group of novel compounds which possess an excellent inhibitory action against the TXA₂ synthetase.

With reference to the groups represented by R², the thienyl may be any of 2 thienyl and 3 thienyl, the furyl any of 2 furyl and 3 furyl, the naphthyl any of α naphthyl and β naphthyl, and the benzothienyl any of 2 benzothienyl, 3 benzothienyl, 4 benzothienyl, 5 benzothienyl, 6 benzothienyl and 7 benzothienyl. Referring to the substituents for the phenyl, thienyl, furyl, naphthyl, benzothienyl and pyridyl represented by R², examples of the lower alkoxy group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms include methoxy, ethoxy, As examples of the lower aliphatic hydrocarbon group, having not more than 8 carbon atoms, there may be mentioned lower alkyl groups of 1 to 8 carbon atoms exemplified by methyl, ethyl, The compounds of the general formula I may be addition salts with pharmacologically allowable organic acids or inorganic acids, and examples of such addition salts include salts with hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, citric acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, etc. In addition, when R³ in the compounds I is a hydrogen atom, they may be alkali metal salts such as sodium and potassium salts, and alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium salts. Representative examples of the compounds I include 2,2 dimethyl 7 phenyl 7 3 pyridyl 6 heptenoic acid, 2,2 dimethyl 8 phenyl 8 3 pyridyl 7 octenoic acid, 2,2 dimethyl 7 2 thienyl 7 3 pyridyl 6 heptenoic acid, 2,2 dimethyl 8 2 thienyl 8 3 pyridyl 7 octenoic acid and 2,2 dimethyl 7 2 naphthyl 7 3 pyridyl 6 heptenoic acid. The substituted vinylcarboxylic acid derivatives of the above general formula. I and salts thereof have a strong inhibitory action on the thromboxane A₂ synthetase solubilized and fractionated from platelet microsomes of humans,cows, horses, etc., and also exhibit, in mammals inclusive of humans, a strong action to inhibiting the biosynthesis of thromboxane A₂ TXA₂ Furthermore, the compounds I of the present invention exhibit the effect of increasing the production efficiency for the dilating I₂ PGI₂ that shows the arterial smooth muscle relaxation action, platelet aggregation inhibiting action or dissociation of platelet aggregation, etc. Thus, prostaglandin G₂ PGG₂ or prostaglandin H₂ PGH₂ is the important intermediate for thromboxane A₂, prostaglandin I₂ and other prostaglandins, and the compounds I of the present invention at very low concentrations not greater than 3 x 10 ⁸ mole exhibit an inhibitory action against the converting enzyme thromboxane A₂ synthetase from PGH₂ or PGG₂ to thromboxane A₂, whereas they show no inhibitory action against the converting enzymes to the physiologically very useful prostaglandin I₂ PGI₂ and other prostaglandins, for example PGI₂ synthetase and prostaglandin synthetase they rather enhance the bioavailability of PGH₂ and PGG₂, and show stimulation of PGD₂ production in platelets and of PGI₂ in the presence of vascular endothelial cells. As is clear from the above, the substituted vinylcarboxylic acid derivatives of the general formula I inhibit selectively thromboxane A₂ TXA₂ synthetase, while not exhibiting a suppressive action toward prostaglandin I₂ PGI₂ synthetase, prostaglandin synthetase cyclooxygenase and various synthetases for prostaglandins.

The substituted vinylcarboxylic acid derivatives I , as produced by the above procedures, can be separated and purified by ordinary means such as extraction, concentration, crystallization and liquid chromatography. Also, the compounds I belong to 3 substituted oiefin compounds, and, in some instances, occur in two geometrical isomers. Separation of the isomers, if necessary, can be effected by fractional crystallization, chromatography or a combination thereof, etc. When the compound of the general formula I is a carboxylic acid in the formula I , R³ is a hydrogen atom , it can be coverted to an ester form in the formula I , R³ is a lower alkyl group by esterification, as the case may be, and conversely, in cases where the compound I is an ester form, it can be converted to a free carboxylic acid, if necessary. Each compound of the formula I I has two geometrical isomers of the formulae wherein each symbol has the meaning given above. In the following description of this invention, the compound wherein, as in the case of compounds represented by the formula I 1a , the pyridine ring substituting one of the carbon atoms involved in the vinyl double bond and the hydrogen atom substituting the other carbon atom are disposed in the same direction is referred to as the E isomer and the compound wherein, as in the case of compounds represented by formula I 1b , the pyridine ring substituting one of the carbon atoms involved in the vinyl double bond and the hydrogen atom substituting the other carbon atom are disposed in the opposite direction is referred to as the Z isomer. The Z isomer I 1b can be isomerized to the E isomer I 1a by an isomerization reaction which comprises heating the Z isomer in the presence of a mineral acid. The isomerization reaction is generally conducted either in water or in an aqueous organic solvent. This aqueous organic solvent should basically be a solvent that is not susceptible to mineral acids. Thus, for example, mixtures of water with acetic acid, formic acid, etc. may be mentioned. The mineral acid,may for example, be hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrobromic acid, perchloric acid, methanesulfonic acid or the like, although hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid or phosphoric acid is preferably employed. This acid is generally used in the proportion of from 6 to 15 moles per mole of the starting compound I 1b . The reaction temperature is generally from 50 to 140 C and preferably from 100 to 130 C. At a lower temperature, the reaction is undesirably retarded. The reaction time varies with the kind and amount of the acid catalyst used and the heating temperature. Generally, such reaction conditions are selected as would reach an equilibrium of acid isomerization in from 10 to 40 hours. This reaction is an equilibrium reaction between the E isomer I 1a and Z isomer I 1b , and, by subjecting either the E isomer or the Z isomer,or an optional mixture of E and Z isomers,to the isomerization reaction, it can be converted to a mixture consisting of from 60 to 70 of E isomer I 1a and from 30 to 40 of Z isomer I 1b . Since, as aforementioned, the E isomer is pharmacologically superior to the Z isomer, this reaction is advantageously applied to mixtures containing 40 or more of Z isomer. When this reaction is conducted using a compound of general formula I 1b wherein R³ is a lower alkyl group as a starting material, a hydrolysis reaction takes place concurrently to give the Compound I 1a wherein R³ is hydrogen. The product compound I 1a E isomer obtainable by this reaction can be isolated and purified by such procedures as, for example, adjusting the reaction mixture to its isoelectric point pH 5.0 to 6.0 with aqueous ammonia, sodium hydroxide ,potassium hydroxide or the like, extracting the product compound with an organic solvent such as ethyl acetate, chloroform, dichloromethane or the like, and subjecting the extract to a conventional purification procedure such as crystallization or chromatography. The yield of this isomerization reaction can be improved by repetitive application thereof to the residual Z isomer rich mixture remaining after isolation, for example,by fractional crystallization, of E isomer I 1a . When the compounds of general formula I Ia and I 1b are carboxylic acids in formulae II and III , R³ is a hydrogen atom , these acids can, if necessary, be esterified to the corresponding esters in formulae I 1a and I 1b , R² is a lower alkyl group . Conversely, if the compounds I 1a and I 1b are esters, they can be hydrolyzed to the free carboxylic acids. The compound I 1 obtained in the reaction of compound II with compound III , or in the reaction of compound IV with compound V , is a substantially equimolar mixture of E and Z isomers. This mixture can be directly used in the practice of this invention but it is of course possible to separate she E and Z isomers from each other e.g. by fractional recrystallization or liquid chromatography and to subject the Z isomer alone to the isomerization reaction mentioned above. The compounds of the above general formula IV can be produced, for example as illustrated in the following manner, by reacting an organic lithium compound with an aldehyde compound to yield a compound XIV , and then reacting said compound XIV with manganese dioxide or dimethyl sulfoxide oxalic chloride. The compounds of the above general formula II can be produced, for example, by reducing a compound of the general formula wherein R¹, R², R³ and Also, the triphenylphosphonium salt of the above general formula V can be produced, for example, by the following reaction The reference examples, examples and experiments are described below to illustrate more specifically the present invention.

As a specimen of TXA₂ synthetase there were employed horse platelet microsomes treated with indomethacin indomethacin treated horse platelet microsomes IPM , which were prepared according to the method described by Needleman To 60 µl of 50 mM tris buffer solution pH 7.5 of IPM containing 140 µg as protein was added 60 µl of the buffer solution or the solution containing the test compounds at various concentrations. The mixtures were left standing for 5 minutes at room temperature. Then, at 0 C to 100 µl portion of the mixture was added 20 µl of the buffer solution containing 30 ng of prostaglandin H₂ PGH₂ . The mixtures were left standing for 5 minutes at 0 C to cause formation of thromboxane A₂ TXA₂ . The reaction of thromboxane A₂ production was stopped by the addition of 500 µl of the tris buffer to the mixture. Using 50 µl of the mixtures, the quantitative determination of thromboxane B² TXB₂ , a stable metabolite of TXA₂, was done by means of the radioimmunoassay Shibouta The inhibitory activity of the compounds on TXA₂ synthetase was determined from the difference in the production of TXB₂ between the test group and the control group. The results on typical compounds are shown by Table VI below
