# Apparatus for curving and tempering or heat toughening thin glass sheets.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to an apparatus for curving and tempering or heat toughening thin glass sheets, with thickness also less than 4 mm and with camber over 60 mm, regardless of the type of curve described by their profile cylindrical, parabolic, etc. . The aforesaid apparatus also permits appreciably shor ter times for transferring the glass sheets V from the heat furnace F to the quenching blasts O , than those times hitherto obtainable with equipment already known in the art. For this purpose, a continuous feed system is provided for the curving rings S, S said system consists of a a horizontal carrousel which permits the individual curving rings S, S to pass under the forming station C every 3 seconds. Rolls R are also provided in the curve forming stations C designed to pass across the curving ring or forming mould S , regardless of the camber of the latter, even if, for hypothesis s sake, it exceeds 60 mm, as the rolls R are not secured to said rings S . Said carrousel preferably consists of the combination of two racks or horizontal chain conveyors B with two pairs of roller conveyors A . Means I are also provided for the rapid lowering and subsequent unloading of the glass sheet V , so that during its heating in the furnace F and after the unloading phase G , the glass sheet is located at a higher level with respect to the path its follows in the curve forming G and quenching O stations. Lastly, electronic stop means are provided, incorporat ing a laser ray which detects the passage of the glass sheets V and which transmits a signal to a closed loop electronic control device, whereby said means replace the mechanical stops and avoid risk of damage to the glass sheets.
