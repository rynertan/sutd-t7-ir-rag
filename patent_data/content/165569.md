# HEPARIN DERIVATIVES

## Abstract
The invention comprises heparin derivative compounds which possess a low density lipoprotein lowering action without a significant anticoagulent effect, and are therefore useful in the treatment of disturbances of fat metabolism, especially hyperlipidemia. The heparin derivatives of the invention are derived from natural heparin, and are prepared by the hydrolysis of heparin and optionally, subsequent acylation at free amine groups of the hydrolyzed heparin.
