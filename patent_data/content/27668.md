# Packing laminate provided with crease lines.

## Abstract
A packing laminate which is intended to be converted into packing containers is often provided with crease lines in order to facilitate folding and shaping. At the places where crease lines cross each other a multiple folding of the laminate takes place on conversion into packing containers which, among other things, means that small cracks are formed in the differ ent material layers, so that the tightness of the packing con tainer is put into jeopardy. In accordance with the invention, a packing laminate is proposed in which these difficulties are overcome in that the laminate is provided with specially designed auxiliary crease lines which in the region of the laminate, where the folding lines cross each other or meet, replace the main crease line guiding the folding line. The auxiliary crease lines are situated at such a distance from the main crease line that the folding line is not affected, that is to say, the folding line will after folding not coincide in any part with the auxiliary crease lines. The auxiliary crease lines will merely be situated on either side of the folding line in such a manner that the take up and guide the crease formation or wrinkling which normally arises in the inner laminate layer in the folding line itself.
