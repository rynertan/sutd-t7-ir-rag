# Polymer composition.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a polymer composition based on a graft copolymer of styrene and acrylonitrile on a rubber and a copolymer of α methylstyrene and acrylonitrile . According to the invention, this polymer composition is characterized in that it consists of A. 50 to 75 wt of a graft copolymer obtained by polymerizing 62.5 75 parts by weight of a monomer mixture consisting of 20 40 wt of acrylonitrile 40 80 wt of styrene and 0.30 wt of one or more other monomers in the presence of 25 37.5 parts by weight of rubber with respect to 100 parts by weight of the graft copolymer , and B. 25 to 50 wt of a copolymer of α methylstyrene and acrylonitrile obtained by polymerizing a mixture of 60 80 parts by weight of α methylstyrene and 20 40 parts by weight of acrylonitrile, and C. 0 to 10 wt of customary additives, the polymer composition containing at least 15 wt rubber.
