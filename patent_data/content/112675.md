# A link structure selectively activable to create a conducting link in an integrated circuit.

## Abstract
Conduction path regions 13 in an integrated circuit are insulated 14 from one another. A link structure, provided between the regions 13 , has an insulating silicon layer 17 and a metal film 16 . To provide a conductive link between the regions 13 the link structure is spot heated, for example by laser beam, to cause the silicon layer 17 to react with the metal film 16 to form a conductive metal silicide bridging the conductive path regions 13 .
