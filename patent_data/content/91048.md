More particularly the invention relates to novel crystalline aluminosilicates of the zeolite type prepared hydrothermally from a reaction mixture comprising an alkali or an alkaline earth metal oxide, silica, alumina, water and methylquinuclidine ions. The mineral zeolite levynite has been known since 1825 and has an idealized chemical composition expressed in terms of mole ratios of oxides as CaO A1203 4 Si02 6 H20Levynite s crystal symmetry is hexagonal with unit cell parameters a0 13.32 A and c0 22.51 A.The X ray powder diffraction pattern of levynite is given in Zeolite Molecular Sieves , D.W.

Kerr. ZK 20 is prepared hydrothermally using an organic cation as a templating agent, namely the l methyl l az√≥nia 4 azabicyclco 2,2,2 octane ion, and has an as synthesized chemical composition, in terms of mole ratios of oxides, of 0.1 0.2 R20 0.8 0.9 Na20 A1203 4 5 Si02 1 5 H20 wherein R is the ion used as the templating agent.Its X ray powder diffraction pattern is set forth in Table II, below TABLE II d A I d A I 14.2 Vw 2.41 10.4 M 2.23 W M 9.5 W 2.18 VW 8.2 S 2.14 M 7.7 W 2.07 VW 6.7 M 2.04 W 5.2 S 1.96 W 4.3 S 1.93 W 4.1 VS 1.90 W 3.86 M S 1.88 VW 3.62 W 1.86 W 3.48 W 1.80 M 3.34 W 1.69 W 3.18 S 1.68 M 3.10 M 1.60 M 2.87 M 1.555 M 2.81 S VS 1.545 M 2.64 M 1.435 M 2.59 vw 1.400 M 2.52 W wherein with respect to the intensity values, VW represents Very Weak W represents Weak M represents Medium S represents Strong and VS represents Very Strong. These intensity value symbols have the same meaning when used hereinafter with respect to any X ray powder diffraction date concerning this or other crystalline materials. Although both of the aforesaid zeolites possess the properties of molecular sieve zeolites, i.e., crystallinity, ability to undergo ion exchange and the ability to reversibly adsorb molecular species such as water, neither has been regarded as having significant commercial potential. This is in part because of their relatively low molar Si02 A1203 ratios, with attendant hydrophilicity, and relatively small pores. These characteristics are common to a number of commercially available zeolite species which have other and more desirable physical and or chemical attributes. The mineral levynite, moreover, is a relatively rare species. There has now been discovered, however, a new crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite species which is topologically related to both the mineral levynite and the synthetic ZK 20, but which differs substantially in its chemical composition from either of the previously known species. This novel zeolite, denominated LZ 132, has, prior to the extraction of any framework aluminum therefrom, a chemical composition expressed in terms of mole ratios of oxides as x MZ nO A1203 y SiO2 zH20 wherein M is at least one cation having the valence n , wxw has a value of from zero to 3.5 and Syw has a value of from 10 to 80, preferably 15 to 50, and z has a value of from 0 to 15, preferably 0 to 5, said aluminosilicate having an X ray powder diffraction pattern containing at least the d spacings of Table III, Table IV or Table V. TABLE III 2 theta d A 8.8 0.3 10.4 9.72 11.1 0.3 8.19 7.76 13.6 4 0.3 6.66 6.37 17.5 0.3 5.16 4.98 21.2 0.3 4.25 4.13 22.3 0.3 4.04 3.93 28.7 0.3 3.14 3.08 32.6 0.3 2.772 2.772 2 Standard techniques were employed to obtain the data of Table III and all other X ray data for LZ 132 appearing hereinafter. The radiation was the K doublet of copper, and a Geiger counter spectrometer with a strip chart pen recorder was employed. The peak heights and their positions as a function of 2 times theta, where theta is the Bragg angle, were read from the spectrometer chart and the interplanar spacing in Angstroms corresponding to the recorded lines were determined. As synthesized, the chemical composition ofLZ 132 in terms of mole ratio of oxides is a Q2 nO bR20 A1203 cSiO2 d H2O wherein a has a value in the range of 0.1 to 1.5, Q is an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal cation having the valence of N N, b has a value in the range of 0.5 to 2.5, the value of a is from 0.9 to 3.5, R represents the methylquinuclidine ion, c has a value of from 10 to 80, preferably 15 to 50, d has a value of from zero to about 15 depending upon the degree of dehydration and the degree to which the intracrystalline pore volume is occupied by the organic or metal cation species.The as synthesized form of the zeolite, which can include the dehydrated activated form, but not the form which results from ion exchange or calcination at a temperature sufficiently high to decompose the organic constitutents, i.e., at tast 4000C., but preferably 5000C. to 6500C. has a characteristicX ray powder diffraction pattern which contains at least the d spacings set forth in Table IV below TABLE IV Relative 2 theta d A Intensity 11.1 0.3 8.19 7.76 17.5 0.3 5.16 4.98 VS 21.2 0.3 4.25 4.13 S 22.2 0.3 4.04 3.93 VS 28.7 0.3 3.14 3.08 S 32.6 0.3 2.772 2.722 The organic cations of the as synthesized zeolite are not considered to be ion exchangeable in the ordinary sense due to steric considerations of the crystal structure, the organic cations themselves and the positions occupied by these cations within the crystal lattice. These large organic cations, moreover, tend to block the pore system and prevent the normal passage of the smaller metal cation species into and out of the crystal structure by the conventional ion exchange mechanism.It is possible, however, to thermally or chemically decompose the organic cation species as well as any occluded organic moieties to molecular or atomic fragments small enough to beremoved through the pore systems. The organic cations associated with A104 tetrahedra can be converted by this procedure to ammonium or hydrogen cations which are ion exchangeable in the usual manner.Calcination of the as synthesized zeolite in air at 6500C for one hour is sufficient to create the methylquinuclidine free decationized form. Lower temperatures and or shorter calcination periods are required to accomplish this result if the calcination is carried out under vacuum conditions.As will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, the ratio of the combined organic and metallic cations to framework aluminium can appear to be substantially higher in the as synthesized form of the zeolite than stoichiometric considerations based on conventional zeolite chemistry would permit.This phenomenon is not unique to LZ 132, however, and has generally been observed in high silica zeolites synthesized from an organic containing system. While the exact conditions of each organic and metal catibnic moiety of the zeolite is not known, it can be theorized that at least some of the organic species are merely occluded in the structure, and in addition entrap alkali or alkaline earth species which are not present in association with AlO4 tetrahedra. In any event there is no doubt that the topology of LZ 132 is essentially zeolitic. It is further noted that upon calcination at temperatures sufficiently high to decompose the organic species present, the X ray powder diffraction pattern of L2 132 changes somewhat. The most notable changes appear in the intensity values for a number of d spacings. Some shifting in line positions are also noted as well as the appearance or disappearance of one or more lines attributed to the removal of the organic species. These changes do not, however, indicate a change in the basic topology of the zeolite structure, the X ray powder diffraction pattern of which is set forth in Table V below.

Zeolite LZ 132 can be prepared hydrothermally by crystallization from a gel whose composition expressed in terms of mole ratios of oxides falls within the following ranges 1.0 A1203 19 80 SiO2 0.3 5.6 R,O 1.0 5.0 02 p0 160 600 H20 wherein R represents the methylquinuclidine ion, NO represents an alkali metal or alkaline earth cation, preferably an alkali metal cation such as sodium, potassium or cesium, and n is the valence of the said metal cation.Preferably, the gel composition expressed in terms of mole ratios of oxides should fall within the following ranges 1.0 A1203 15 50 SiO2 2.0 4.0 methylquinuclidine 20 1.0 4.5 Na20 350 450 H20 In preparing the aqueous reaction mixture the conventional reactants used in zeolite synthesis are suitably employed. Alumina can be obtained from activated alumina, alpha alumina, gamma alumina, boehmite, pseudo boehmite, alumina trihydrate, aluminum hydroxide or sodium aluminate. Silica can be obtained from precipitated silica, sodium silicate, silica sol or silica aerogel. Advantageously, the crystallization procedure is carried out at temperatures in the range of from about 1000C to 2000C, preferably at 125 C to 1500C, the pressure being autogenous pressure, until the product is crystallized. The product is then filtered, washed add dried. It is observed that LZ 132 is not produced as a pure product over the entire gel composition, temperature and time ranges indicated above.Commonly, there is also produced another novel crystalline zeolite species, denominated LZ 133, which is believed to be topologically related to LZ 132, but whose structure has not yet been determined. LZ 133 is described in detail in copending application Serial No. filed contemporaneously with the present application. It appears that the use of silica sols as the silica source in the reaction mixture, lower temperatures and longer crystallization periods, tend to favor the production of LZ 132, whereas precipitated amorphous silica as the silica source, coupled with higher temperatures and shorter crystallization periods, tend to favor the production of LZ 133. The method for preparing zeolite LZ 132 is illustrated by the following examples.Example 1 a Preparation of metnylquinuclidine hydroxide MEQOH . Initially 102.8 grams of quinuclidine l azabicyclo 2,2,2 octane were dissolved in 500 grams of ethylene glycol in a one liter 3 neck round bottom flask fitted with a condenser, a thermometer and a mechanical glass stirring rod with an inert plastic crescent stirring blade. In a constant dropping funnel, 144.4 grams of methyl iodide CH3I was diluted with 500 grams of ethylene glycol. The methyl iodide solution was slowly added into the quinuclidine solution with vigorous mixing. A temperature rise of 500C was observed. After the completion of the addition of methyl iodide solution, the entire solution was mixed vigorously for another 5 hours. Then the solution was vacuum distilled in a rotary evaporator. A total of 130 grams of dried solid product was recovered.A 13C NMR study of the product indicated that methylquinuclidine iodide MeQI was the principal product with trace amounts of ethylene glycol. The chemical analysis results for a similar preparation using water as a solvent gave a carbon to nitrogen ratio of 8.5 compared to a theoretical ratio of 8.0 5.2 wt N, 37.6 wt. C on an anhydrous basis solution contained 69.5 wt MeQI . The as synthesized product, 128.4 grams of methylquinuclidine iodide, was thereafter dissolved in 128.4 grams of distilled water in a constant dropping funnel. Then, 129.3 grams of Ag20 was slurried with 129.3 grams of distilled water in a 500 cc, 3 neck flask equipped with a condenser, a mechanical stirrer and the constant dropping funnel. With vigorous stirring, methylquinuclidine iodide solution was added dropwise.After completion of the addition, the 3 neck flask was wrapped entirely with aluminum foil to keep the room light out of the flask. The vigorous stirring was carried out overnight. The final solution was filtered and stored in a 500 ml polypropylene bottle. The final solution was chemically analyzed and found to contain 16.0 wtt carbon, 1.86 wt nitrogen and 1.30 meq. gram of total alkalinity.These data convert into a carbon to nitrogen ratio of 10.0 compared to a theoretical ratio of 8.0 and a methylquinuclidine hydroxide MeQOH concentration of 1.3 molar based on total alkalinity. The higher than theoretical C N ratio could result from dissolved ethylene gylcol or carbonate. b Preparation of LZ 132 NaOH in an amount of 1.2 grams was dissolved along with 2 grams of alumina in 5 grams of distilled water with heat and stirring in a beaker. The hot sodium aluminate solution was added to 72.9 grams of an aqueous silica sol and mixed well. The sodium aluminate beaker was rinsed with 4 grams of distilled water and the rinse water added to the alumina silica gel. Then 50.5 grams of 18.6 wtt methylquinuclidine solution, prepared according to part a above, were added to the alumina silica gel and mixed well. The final gel had a molar oxide composition of 1.0 A1203 27.3 Si02 1.1 Na O 4.9 methylquinuclidine hydroxide MeQOH 420 H20. The synthesis gel was then placed in a polytetrafluoroethylene container, which was in turn sealed in a stainless steel reactor, and digested at 1500C for 168 hours. The solid reaction product was recovered by filtration, washed with water and dried at ambient temperature. The product was identified by X ray diffraction as zeolite LZ 132. The chemical composition of the anhydrous product was as follows 4.4 wt A1203, 70.9 wtZ Si02, 0.63 wtZ Na20, 14.4 wt. C, 2.0 wt N, and 24.1 wt loss on ignition at 10000C.The chemical composition expressed in terms of oxide mole ratios was as follows 1.0 A1203 27.4 SiO2 0.24 Na20 1.74 MeQ 20 The methylguinuclidine content was based on the carbon analysis . The as synthesized LZ 132 exhibited the following X ray powder diffraction pattern. This pattern is essentially the same as the pattern of all other pre calcined zeolite LZ 132 compositions which are in the mixed sodium and methylquinuclidine cation form.

The stepwise calcination procedure consisted of raising the sample temperature to l000C., followed by a heat up rate of 1000C hr., with an intermittent holding time of one hour when the temperature reached 2000, 3000, 4000 and 5000C, until the final temperature reached 5900C. During the heat up time, the sample was under a nitrogen gas purge. When the temperature reached 5900C, the sample was calcined in oxygen for one hour. The l0cc of 5.0 vol.

The test procedure employed was the catalytic cracking of premixed 2 mole n butane in ahelium stream in a 1 2 O.D. quartz tube reactor over 5 grams 20 40 mesh of the zeolite to be tested. The sample was activated in situ for 60 minutes at 5000C under 200 cm3 min dry helium purge. Then the 2 mole 8 n butane in helium at a flow rate of 50 cm3 min was passed over the sample for 40 min. with product stream analysis being carried out at 10 minute intervals. The pseudo first order reaction rate constant ks was than calculated to determine the catalytic activity of the zeolite LZ 132. The ks value for the calcinedLZ 132 sample was found to be 6.7 as compared to a kd value of 1.1 for NH4 Y zeolite.
