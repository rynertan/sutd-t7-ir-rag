# Low profile resilient suspension assembly for a vehicle seat.

## Abstract
The assembly 10 comprises a pair of horizontally positioned, adjustably tensioned springs 45 to support the weight of a seat and its occupant mounted on an upper support 14 . The springs 45 are completely independent of the linkage 16 which guides the upper support 14 for generally vertical parallel movement relative to a base support 12 . The tension of the springs 45 can be adjusted by a weight adjustment mechanism 20 acting on one end 45 of the springs 45 , to accommodate occupants of differing weights. The opposite ends 45 of the springs 45 are attached to the short arms 56 of a pair of connected bellcranks 56 pivoted to the upper support 14 . The long arms 56 of the bellcranks 56 have a predetermined cam shape 60 along one edge that engages a cam follower 62 that is fixed during operation of the assembly 10 relative to the base support 12 . The cam 60 is shaped to provide any desired load deflection characteristic for the suspension assembly 10 . In a preferred embodiment, a height adjust ment mechanism 22 is provided.
