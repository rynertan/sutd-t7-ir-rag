## Description
The present invention relates to the synthesis of crystalline oxides from a reaction medium consisting of two liquid phases and comprising an organic or inorganic directing agent and specific reactants. This synthesis results in a crystallin oxide framework having ion exchange properties and being readily convertible to catalytically active material. Aluminum phosphates are taught in U.S. Patents 4,310,440 and 4,385,994, for example. Aluminum phosphate materials have electroneutral lattices and, therefore, are not useful as ion exchangers or as catalyst components. Microporous aluminum phosphates have a composition typified as FR A 1,364,555 and 1,412,923 describe the preparation of crystalline oxides which despite containing elements other than silicon and aluminium are still to be considered to be, or to be related to, zeolites. The phosphorus substituted zeolites of Canadian Patents 911,416 911,417 and 911,418 are referred to as aluminosilicophosphate zeolites. Some of the phosphorus therein appears to be occluded, not structural. These latter materials containing silicon, aluminum and phosphorus are characterized by the general formula U.S. Patent 4,363,748 describes a combination of silica and aluminum calcium cerium phosphate as a low acid activity catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation. Great Britain Patent 2,068,253 discloses a combination of silica and aluminum calcium tungsten phosphate as a low acid activity catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation. U.S. Patent 3,801,704 teaches an aluminum phosphate treated in a certain way to impart acidity. U.S. Patent 4,228,036 teaches an alumina aluminum phosphate silica matrix as an amorphous body to be mixed with zeolite for use as cracking catalyst. U.S. Patent 3,213,035 teaches improving hardness of aluminosilicate catalysts by treatment with phosphoric acid. The catalysts are amorphous. U.S. Patent 2,876,266 describes an active silicophosphoric acid or salt phase of an amorphous material prepared by absorption of phosphoric acid by premolded silicates or aluminosilicates. Other teachings of aluminum phosphates and their preparation include U.S. Patents 4,365,095 4,361,705 4,222,896 4,210,560 4,179,358 4,158,621 4,071,471 4,014,945 3,904,550 and 3,697,550. Since their neutral framework structure is void of ion exchange properties, they are used as catalyst supports or matrices. U.S. Patent 4,440,871 describes various crystalline microporous materials characterized as silicoaluminophosphates . These materials are prepared hydrothermally from aqueous gels containing reactive phosphorus, silicon and aluminum compounds and organic templating agents. The crystalline oxides synthesized hereby are molecular sieve or other framework structures exhibiting ion exchange properties and are easily and conveniently converted to materials having intrinsic catalytic activity. Techniques for synthesis of zeolites or aluminum phosphates taught in the art are not felt to be particularly useful for synthesis of these oxides and their substituted analogs. Therefore, in its broadest composition of matter aspects, the present invention provides a crystalline oxide having a composition, in the anhydrous state, as follows Such a crystalline material can be formed by calcining, i.e. heating, as hereinafter described, a crystalline oxide in the as synthesized form having a composition, in the anhydrous state, as follows In its broadest synthesis aspect, the present invention provides a method for synthesis of crystalline oxides which comprises the steps of 1 preparing a two phase reaction mixture containing particular components and comprising both a liquid organic phase and a liquid aqueous phase 2 heating the reaction mixture at a rate of from 5 C to 200 C per hour to a temperature of from 80 C to 300 C 3 agitating the reaction mixture in a manner sufficient to intimately admix said liquid organic and aqueous phases with each other 4 maintaining the agitated reaction mixture at a temperature of from 80 C to 300 C and a pH of from 2 to 9 until crystals of crystalline oxide material are formed and 5 recovering the crystalline oxide material from the reaction mixture. The essential components of the two phase reaction mixture include water, sources of a an oxide of one or more elements X having valence plus 3, b an oxide of one or more elements Y having valence plus 5, c an oxide of one or more elements Z having valence plus 4, d an organic directing agent A, e inorganic cations M and f anions N and a substantially water immiscible organic solvent. Such components are present in the following relationships A Upon initial preparation of the reaction mixture, the source of one of the X, Y or Z oxides is dispersed or dissolved in the organic phase. The crystalline oxide material recovered from the reaction mixture is characterized by a composition, in the anhydrous state as follows The crystalline oxides prepared by the present method are effective cationic ion exchangers and acid catalysts when the X Y e.g. Al P ratio is greater than unity. Such catalysts have an acid strength spectrum differing from that of zeolites, which can be beneficial in some catalytic processes. For X Y ratios lower than unity, anionic exchange properties prevail and render such materials active for base catalyzed reactions. They also offer a new class of catalyst supports and are particularly interesting in this respect because of their high ion exchange capacity which should enable the retention of rather high metal loadings. They will show in the latter case the same catalytic flexibility as other supported metal or metal oxide s catalysts. Sorption properties indicate that they are molecular shape selective and this can be advantageous in numerous catalytic processes as known in the art of zeolite catalysis. If synthesized with an X Y e.g., aluminum phosphorus atomic ratio of greater than one, the crystalline oxide e.g., silicophosphoaluminate may exhibit an X Z e.g., aluminum silicon atomic ratio of greater than 1.5, and usually in the range of from 1.6 to 600. When the X Y e.g., aluminum phosphorus ratio is of less than one, it may exhibit a Y Z e.g., phosphorus silicon atomic ratio of greater than unity, usually within the range of from 1.2 to 600. It is well recognized that aluminum phosphates exhibit a phosphorus aluminum atomic ratio of essentially unity, and essentially no silicon. Also, the phosphorus substituted zeolite compositions, sometimes referred to as aluminosilicophosphate zeolites, have a silicon aluminum atomic ratio of usually greater than unity, generally from 0.66 to 8.0, and a phosphorus aluminum atomic ratio of less than unity, usually from greater than 0 to 1. The use of a two phase synthesis reaction mixture system, exclusive of the solids, enables one to maintain in solution in the organic phase one or more of the reactants which are normally insoluble or unstable in the aqueous phase under the present synthesis conditions. Such a procedure enables the preparation of oxides the synthesis of which is believed to be more difficult using other techniques. Further, microporous properties can be achieved for the crystalline oxides by performing inorganic syntheses in the presence of organic or inorganic directing agents. In addition to its templating role, the organic directing agent can also act as a surfactant. It can thus help the codispersion of the organic and aqueous phases containing the reagents. As noted hereinbefore, in the synthesis method of the present invention, the reaction mixture will contain sufficient sources of Z e.g., silicon , Y e.g., phosphorus and X e.g., aluminum , directing agent s and an organic solvent. The organic directing agent may be selected from the group consisting of organic mono , di or polyamines and onium compounds having the following formulas Particularly preferred organic directing agents for the present method include alkylamines wherein alkyl is of 1 to 3 carbon atoms and onium compounds, above defined, wherein R is alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, R is alkylene of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, M is nitrogen and X is halide or hydroxide. Non limiting examples of these include di n propylamine, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide, tetraethylammonium hydroxide, tetrapropylammonium bromide, and hexamethyl hexane diammonium hydroxide or bromide. An inorganic hydroxide or salt useful as a pH adjustant agent can also serve as a supplemental directing agent. Non limiting examples of such compounds are KOH, NaOH, CsOH, CsBr, NaCl, Ca OH ₂, and the like. The organic solvent used to form the two phase reactive mixture can be any organic liquid which is substantially immiscible with water under the crystallization conditions of the present method. Non limiting examples of such a solvent include the C₅ C₁₀ alcohols, phenols, and naphthols and other water immiscible organic solvents. Polar organic compounds are preferred for the organic phase solvent. The inorganic cations and anions essentially present in the reaction mixture are generally not provided by separately added components. Rather, these cations and anions will frequently come from compounds added to the reaction mixture to provide the other essential components such as the silicon, alumina and or phosphorus sources or such as the directing agent or any pH adjustant agents which may be used. One of the sources of X, Y or Z oxide must initially be present in the organic phase of the reaction mixture. The aqueous phase will thus comprise the directing agent, cations and anions, pH adjustant agents and those remaining essential components which are not added to the organic phase. Examples of atoms represented by X include aluminum, iron chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, arsenic, antimony, manganese, gallium and boron, each in the plus 3 valence state. Examples of atoms represented by Y include phosphorus, arsenic, antimony and vanadium, each in the plus 5 valence state. Examples of atoms represented by Z include silicon, germanium and titanium each in the plus 4 valence state. The aqueous phase may comprise, e.g., the aluminum and phosphorus components of synthesis mixture. These components may be incorporated into the aqueous phase by dissolving or partially dissolving a pre formed solid crystalline aluminum phosphate material in the aqueous phase. This dissolution is accomplished by maintaining the aqueous phase at a sufficiently alkaline pH, e.g., by incorporating therein a sufficient amount of a basic material as hereinbefore described. Optionally, additional sources of aluminum and or phosphorus, e.g., Al₂O₃ and or H₃PO₄, may also be incorporated into the aqueous phase. The reaction mixture of the composition hereinbefore described is heated carefully at a rate of from about 5 C to about 200 C per hour up to a temperature of from about 80 C to about 300 C and maintained within that temperature range until crystals of desired crystalline oxide form, usually from about 5 hours to about 500 hours. The pH of the reaction mixture during crystallization is carefully maintained at from about 2 to about 9. This may be accomplished by adjusting the concentration of the added base s . During the heat up at crystallization steps the reaction mixture will generally be agitated in a manner sufficient to intimately admix the substantially immiscible organic and aqueous phases. Techniques for dispersing the organic and aqueous phases in each other are well know in the art. It may even be desirable to form an emulsion of the organic and aqueous phases in order to maximize the interface between these liquid phases. Following crystallization of the desired oxide the reaction mixture containing same may be filtered and the recovered crystals may be washed, for example with water, and then dried, such as by heating at from about 25 C to about 150 C at atmospheric pressure. In accordance with the method of the present invention, a source of aluminum and phosphorus in the synthesis mixture may be dissolved or partially dissolved aluminum phosphate. Such aluminum phosphate may be supplied in the form of an amorphous material, a crystalline material or mixtures thereof. Crystalline aluminum phosphates may have dense or open pore type structures. Examples of the latter type of crystalline aluminum phosphates are described in U.S. Patents 4,310,440 and 4,385,994. Examples of basic materials which may be incorporated into the aqueous phase include hydroxides of Group I metals of the Periodic Table as well as alkali metal carbonates, silicates, and hydroxides of tetraalkylammonium ions. Additional sources of aluminum include, as non limiting examples, any known form of aluminum oxide or hydroxide, organic or inorganic salt or compound. Additional sources of phosphorus include, as non limiting examples, any known form of phosphorus acids or phosphorus oxides, phosphates and phosphites, and organic derivatives of phosphorus. Useful sources of silicon include, as non limiting examples, any known form of silicic acid or silicon dioxide, alkoxy or other compounds of silicon. In a more specific illustration of a particular synthesis method in accordance with the present invention, the aqueous phase contains phosphorus and aluminum components. The organic phase with hexanol as solvent contains a germanium source, e.g. tetra orthoalkyl germanate. The organic directing agent, e.g. tetraalkylammonium hydroxide or an amine, also acts as a surfactant to emulsify the aqueous and organic phases and optimize the interface. Germanium is progressively supplied during synthesis to the gel by hydrolysis of its organic compound and transfer of the product through the interface into the aqueous phase. As Z, X and Y must be available simultaneously to nucleate and crystallize the desired oxide the rates of supply of all three elements have to be comparable. This implies that when an aluminum phosphate is used as a source of aluminum and phosphorus, the dissolution of the aluminum phosphate and the hydrolysis of the organic germanium compound should be concerted. Therefore, it may be important to predissolve at least a portion of the aluminum phosphate. Even more critical will be the germanium supply rate which is dependent on factors such as the magnitude of the interface, temperature, pH of the aqueous phase, concentration, and nature of the organic solvent and of the germanium reagent. Because the hydrolysis and transfer rates of alkoxy compounds of Z are controlled by the magnitude of the interface, as discussed earlier, Z incorporation is expected to be favored as mixing increases. As mentioned earlier, pH is an important synthesis variable. As the formation of the oxide proceeds, pH values of around or above neutral i.e. about 6 or more, up to a maximum of about 9 should be maintained. As the base stability of the oxides is expected to be intermediate between those of aluminum phosphates and zeolites, pH values of about or slightly above 8 are preferred. Because of the major role played by the hydrolysis of the Z containing reagent and the necessity to control it in the present method, there is a need to have a nearly constant pH during crystallization. This can be achieved by predissolving the aluminum phosphate before addition of the other reagents. To achieve and maintain higher pH values pH 8 or above , even after partial decomposition of the organic hydroxide, inorganic bases may be added. These inorganic bases can also play a role as supplemental directing agents as noted hereinbefore. By means of the synthesis aspect of the present invention, it is possible to prepare oxides by having from about 1 to about 20 percent, in terms of mole fraction, of Z e.g., Si , from about 35 to about 50 percent, in terms of mole fraction of X e.g., Al and from about 35 to about 50 percent, in terms of mole fraction of Y e.g., P . Accordingly, by means of the synthesis aspect of the present invention, it is possible to make oxides having empirical formulae not accounted for in pentagonal compositional areas in Figures 1 and 2 of the Lok et al U.S. Patent No. 4,440,871. More particularly in this regard, X may be present in a mole fraction of from 30 to 44 percent, Y may be present in a mole fraction of from 43 to 50 percent and Z may be present in a mole fraction of from 6 to 20 percent, wherein obviously, the sum of the mole fractions of x, Y and Z is 100. Microporous, crystalline oxide materials of the present invention have substantial ion exchange capacity and catalytic activity. To the contrary, corresponding materials of the same crystalline structure containing only aluminum, phosphorus and oxygen in the lattice structures thereof have little or no ion exchange capacity and catalytic activity. Accordingly, for example, the Alpha Value of a material according to the invention may be at least 100 percent or even at least 1000 percent greater than the Alpha Value of a corresponding material of the same crystalline structure, said corresponding material having only aluminum, phosphorus and oxygen in the lattice structure thereof. Examples of such corresponding materials are generally referred to in the Wilson et al U.S. Patent No. 4,310,440. The oxides prepared hereby may be molecular sieves or other framework structures. When they are molecular sieves or dense materials, they will possess definite distinguishing crystalline structures which exhibit characteristic X ray powder diffraction patterns. When X ray values are determined herein for the oxides of the present invention, whether molecular sieve or other structures, the radiation is the K alpha doublet of copper and a diffractometer equipped with a scintillation counter and an associated computer is used. The peak heights, I, and the positions as a function of 2 theta, where theta is the Bragg angle, are determined using algorithms on the computer associated with the spectrometer. From these, the relative intensities, 100 I I The oxides of the present invention are microporous or dense materials with a framework containing tetrahedrally coordinated by oxygen Z e.g., Si , Y e.g., P and X e.g., Al atoms. If microporous, they show ion exchange, acidic, and catalytic properties which resemble those of zeolites. Because of their different acid strength spectrum, however, they are potentially interesting as catalysts for acid catalyzed conversions in which too high or too low an acidity may result in unwanted secondary reactions. Acidity associated with framework X e.g., Al is brought in by replacement of Y e.g., phosphorus with Z e.g, silicon . Alternately, basicity associated with framework Y e.g., P occurs when framework X e.g., aluminum is replaced by Z e.g., silicon . The ionic radii of X, Y and Z should be sufficient to permit the formation of th proper framcwork structure containing tetrahedral coordination. More particularly, it is felt that the ionic Radius Ratio of these elements should be in the range of from about 0.15 to about 0.73. The term Radius Ratio is defined as the ratio of th crystal ionic radius of the element M to the crystal ionic radius of the oxygen anion, O ². The crystal ionlc radii of, elements are listed in the Examples of Radius Ratios for various elements in various valence states are as follows The oxides synthesized hereby can also be used as catalysts in intimate combination with a metal component such as silver, tungsten, vanadium, molybdenum, rhenium, chromium, manganese, or a Group VIII metal such as platinum or palladium where, for example, a hydrogenation dehydrogenation or oxidation function is to be performed Such a component can be ion exchanged into the composition, impregnated therein or intimately physically admixed therewith. Such component can be impregnated in or onto it such as for example, by, in the case of platinum, treating the crystal with a solution containing a platinum metal containing ion. Thus, suitable platinum compounds include chloroplatinic acid, platinum chlorides and various compounds containing the platinum amine complex. The original ions, i.e. cations or anions, of the as synthesized oxides can be replaced in accordance with techniques well known in the art, at least in part, by ion exchange with other cations or anions. Preferred replacing cations include metal ions, hydrogen ions, hydrogen precursor, e.g. ammonium, ions and mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred cations include hydrogen, rare earth metals and metals of Groups IIA, IIIA, IVA, IB, IIB, IIIB, IVB, VIB and VIII of the Periodic Table of the Elements. A typical ion exchange technique would be to contact the synthetic crystalline oxide with a salt of the desired replacing ion or ions. Examples of such salts of cations include the halides, e.g. chlorides, nitrates and sulfates. The as synthesized oxide prepared in accordance herewith can be beneficially converted to another form by thermal treatment. This thermal treatment is generally performed by heating one of these forms at a temperature of at least 300 C for at least 1 minute and generally not longer than 20 hours. While subatmospheric pressure can be employed for the thermal treatment, atmospheric pressure is desired for reasons of convenience. The thermal treatment can be performed at a temperature up to about 1000 C. The thermally treated product is particularly useful in the catalysis of certain hydrocarbon conversion reactions. Further, the oxide when employed either as an adsorbent, ion exchanger or as a catalyst in an organic compound conversion process should be dehydrated, at least partially. This can be done by heating to a temperature in the range of 200 C to 600 C in air or an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen, etc. and at atmospheric, subatmospheric or superatmospheric pressures for between 30 minutes and 48 hours. Dehydration can also be performed at room temperature merely by placing the oxide in a vacuum, but a longer time is required to obtain a sufficient amount of dehydration. Therefore, depending upon the degree of dehydration or thermal treatment desired for the oxide it may be subjected to heating at a temperature of from about 200 C to about 1000 C for a time of from about 1 minute to about 48 hours. The crystals of the oxide prepared by the instant invention can be shaped into a wide variety of particle sizes. Generally speaking, the particles can be in the form of a powder, a granule, or a molded product, such as an extrudate having a particle size sufficient to pass through a 2 mesh Tyler screen and be retained on a 400 mesh Tyler screen. In cases where the composition is molded, such as by extrusion, the crystals can be extruded before drying or partially dried and then extruded. In the case of many catalysts, it is desired to incorporate the oxide with another material resistant to the temperatures and other condition employed in organic conversion processes. Such materials include active and inactive material and synthetic or naturally occurring zeolites as well as inorganic materials such as clays, silica and or metal oxides. The latter may be either naturally occurring or in the form of gelatinous precipitates or gels including mixtures of silica and metal oxides. Use of a material in conjunction with the new oxide i.e. combined therewith, which is active, tends to improve the conversion and or selectivity of the catalyst in certain organic conversion processes. Inactive materials suitably serve as diluents to control the amount of conversion in a given process so that products can be obtained economically and orderly without employing other means for controlling the rate of reaction. These materials may be incorporated into naturally occurring clays, e.g. bentonite and kaolin, to improve the crush strength of the catalyst under commercial operating conditions. Said materials, i.e. clays, oxides, etc., function as binders for the catalyst. It is desirable to provide a catalyst having good crush strength because in commercial use it is desirable to prevent the catalyst from breaking down into powder like materials. These clay binders have been employed normally only for the purpose of improving the crush strength of the catalyst. Naturally occurring clays which can be composited with the new crystal include the montmorillonite and kaolin families which include the subbentonites, and the kaolins commonly known as Dixie, McNamee, Georgia and Florida clays or others in which the main mineral contituent is halloysite, kaolinite, dickite, nacrite, or anauxite. Such clays can be used in the raw sate as originally mined or initially subjected to calcination, acid treatment or chemical modification. Binders useful for compositing with the present crystal also include inorganic oxides, notably alumina or silica. In addition to the foregoing materials, the oxide can be composited with a porous matrix material such as aluminum phosphate, silica alumina, silica magnesia, silica zirconia, silica thoria, silica beryllia, silica titania as well as ternary compositions such as silica alumina thoria, silica alumina zirconia, silica alumina magnesia and silica magnesia zirconia. The relative proportions of finely divided crystalline oxide material and inorganic oxide gel matrix vary widely, with the crystal content ranging from about 1 to about 90 percent by weight and more usually, particularly when the composite is prepared in the form of beads, in the range of about 2 to about 80 weight percent of the composite. The crystalline materials of the present invention are readily convertible to catalytically active material for a variety of organic, e.g. hydrocarbon, compound conversion processes. Such conversion processes include, as non limiting examples, cracking hydrocarbons with reaction conditions including a temperature of from about 300 C to about 700 C, a pressure of from about 0.1 atmosphere bar to about 30 atmospheres and a weight hourly space velocity of from about 0.1 hr ¹ to about 20 hr ¹ dehydrogenating hydrocarbon compounds with reaction conditions including a temperature of from about 300 C to about 700 C, a pressure of from about 0.1 atmosphere to about 10 atmospheres and a weight hourly space velocity af from about 0.1 to about 20 converting paraffins to aromatics with reaction conditions including a temperature of from about 100 C to about 700 C, a pressure of from about 0.1 atmosphere to about 60 atmospheres, a weight hourly space velocity of from about 0.5 to about 400 and a hydrogen hydrocarbon mole ratio of from about 0 to about 20 converting olefins to aromatics, e.g. benzene, toluene and xylenes, with reaction conditions including a temperature of from about 100 C to about 700 C, a pressure of from about 0.1 atmosphere to about 60 atmospheres, a weight hourly space velocity of from about 0.5 to about 400 and a hydrogen hydrocarbon mole ratio of from about 0 to about 20 converting alcohols, e.g. methanol, or ethers, e.g. dimethylether, or mixtures thereof to hydrocarbons including aromatics with reaction conditions including a temperature of from about 275 C to about 600 C, a pressure of from about 0.5 atmosphere to about 50 atmospheres and a liquid hourly space velocity of from about 0.5 to about 100 isomerizing xylene feedstock components with reaction conditions including a temperature of from about 230 C to about 510 C, a pressure of from about 3 atmospheres to about 35 atmospheres, a weight hourly space velocity of from about 0.1 to about 200 and a hydrogen hydrocarbon mole ratio of from about 0 to about 100 disproportionating toluene with reaction conditions including a temperature of from about 200 C to about 760 C, a pressure of from about atmospheric to about 60 atmospheres and a weight hourly space velocity of from about 0.08 to about 20 alkylating aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. benzene and alkylbenzenes, in the presence of an alkylating agent, e.g. olefins, formaldehyde, alkyl halides and alcohols, with reaction conditions including a temperature of from about 340 C to about 500 C, a pressure of from about atmospheric to about 200 atmospheres, a weight hourly space velocity of from about 2 to about 2000 and an aromatic hydrocarbon alkylating agent mole ratio of from about 1 1 to about 20 1 and transalkylating aromatic hydrocarbons in the presence of polyalkylaromatic hydrocarbons with reaction conditions including a temperature of from about 340 C to about 500 C, a pressure of from about atmospheric to about 200 atmospheres, a weight hourly space velocity of from about 10 to about 1000 and an aromatic hydrocarbon polyalkylaromatic hydrocarbon mole ratio of from about 1 1 to about 16 1. In general, therefore, catalytic conversion conditions over a catalyst comprising the oxide in active form include a temperature of from about 100 C to about 760 C, a pressure of from about 0.1 atmosphere bar to about 200 atmospheres bar , a weight hourly space velocity of from about 0.08 hr ¹ to about 2000 hr ¹ and a hydrogen organic, e.g. hydrocarbon, compound of from 0 to about 100. In order to more fully illustrate the nature of the invention and the manner of practising same, the following examples are presented. When Alpha Value is examined, it is noted that the Alpha Value is an approximate indication of the catalytic cracking activity of the catalyst compared to a standard catalyst and it gives the relative rate constant rate of normal hexane conversion per volume of catalyst per unit time . It is based on the activity of the highly active silica alumina cracking catalyst taken as an Alpha of 1 Rate Constant 0.016 sec ¹ . In the case of zeolite HZSM 5, only 174 ppm of tetrahedrally coordinated A1₂O₃ are required to provide an Alpha Value of 1. The Alpha Test is described in U.S. Patent 3,3543,078 and in For the purposes of the present specification and claims which follow, ion exchange capacity is determined by titrating with a solution of sulfamic acid the gaseous ammonia evolved during the temperature programmed decomposition of the ammonium form of the oxide. The method is described in A two phase synthesis reaction mixture was prepared with the organic phase comprised of 12g of Ge OC₂H₅ ₄ and 60g l hexanol, and the aqueous phase comprised of 23.lg H₃PO₄ 85 , l0g Al₂O₃, 37g TEAOH 40 and 7lg of water. The directing agent in the organic phase was tetraethylammonium hydroxide. The reaction mixture was heated at 50 C per hour to l30 C and maintained at that temperature for 24 hours.
