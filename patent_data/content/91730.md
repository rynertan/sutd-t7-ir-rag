## Abstract
A tag has a transparent window moulding 3 to display a symbol motif on an insert 32 via a domed window portion 27 and an identification card housed in a tray 5 through a window portion 26. The insert 32 is received between the window portion 27 and a backing disc 4 which is sealingly secured to the window moulding 3 by means of a skirt 28 received in a rebate 31. The sub assembly of moulding 3 and disc 4 is permantently housed between housing mouldings 1 and 2 and the tray 5 is a sliding fit in the assembly. Aligned holes 8 and 43 in the housing moulding 1 and tray 5 receive a chain for attachment of the tag to a handle of a bag.

## Description
Title TAGThis invention relates to tags for attachment to the handles of tote bags, duffel bags, sports bags or the like for the purpose of identification of the owner.Such tags not only have a utilitarian purpose of carrying a name and address label, but it many cases are expected to be distinctive in themselves or to enable the owner to identify as part of a group, e.g. an interest group. This is particularly true of young people. For this purpose it is advantageous if a tag can include one of a wide range of symbols in a clearly visible place.In view of the wide range of symbols which may be used, it is preferable that the symbols be rapidly changeable during a production run. However, they need to be permanently and securely held in the tag in such a manner as to make then appear to be integral therewith. For the first of these requirements it is preferably to use symbols printed on inserts, e.g. of card, cut to the required shape and held behind a transparent part of the tag. It is necessary for this permanently secured part of the tag to be inserted in a waterproof manner, i.e.leakages around the edges must be avoided, since discoloration of the printed symbol would not be acceptable. For economic production, it is preferably for moulding runs to be maintained for a long period without interuption to make changes, so that it is preferable if the symbol be Introduced at an assembly rather than a moulding stage.According to the present invention there is provided a tag adapted to be attached to the handle of a bag or the like, the said tag including a zone for displaying and protecting a removable identification marker and a zone displaying and protecting a permanently incorporated decorative symbol, in which the decorative symbol is marked on or formed by an insert located between a transparent window and a backing disc, the backing disc and transparent window being secured together by an integral peripheral flange of one of them being permanently and sealingly secured around the periphery of a matching formation on the other of them so as to form a sub assembly permanently secured between matching housing parts having means for receiving the removable identification marker.The invention will be further described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in whichFigure 1 is a sectional view of the tag in accordance with a preferred form of the invention taken on the lines E E of figures 2, 3 and 4, F F of Figure 10 and H H of Figure 9 Figure 2 is an elevation of a front housing part Figure 3 is an internal elevation of the front housing part of figure 2 Figure 4 is an elevation of a rear housing part Figure 5 to 8 are sectional views of the front and rear housing parts somewhat spaced apart and taken on the lines A A, B B,C C, and D D respectively of figures 2 and 3 Figure 9 is an elevation of a window element Figure 10 is an elevation of a tray andFigure 11 is a section on the line G G of Figure 10.It will be seen from figure 1 in particular that the tag illustrated comprises five separately injection moulded parts. These are identified in figure 1 as a front housing part 1, a rear housing part 2 a transparent window element 3, a backing disc 4 and a removable tray 5. In the finished tag, the housing parts 1 and 2, the window element 3 and the backing disc 4 are secured together by suitable adhesive or otherwise, and the tray 5 is releasably and slidably received in a recess within the tag body formed by the other components. Figures 2 and 3 show respectively the external and internal elevations of the front housing part 1, and it can be seen that this part has a first aperture 6 through which a symbol may be viewed, and a second aperture 7 through which an identification cards, carried by the tray 5, may be viewed. The tray 5 is further provided with a through hole 8, radiused at the front end 9 to receive a chain or other flexible retaining member by which the tag is to be attached to the handle of a bag, case or other similar item. The element 1 is also provided with a peripheral rebate 10 see also figures 5 to 8 to mate with a corresponding internal rebate 11 on the housing member 2.A end rebate 12 provides location for a matching projection 13 on the tray 5, and the housing member 1 and tray 5 are also formed with matching capillary breaks 14 and 15 to prevent seepage of rainwater along the clearance between them.The apertures 6 and 7 by sealing and retaining flanges 6a and 7a respectively.Turning now to figures 4, and also figures 5 to 8 as appropriate, the rear housing portion 2 is shown as having the peripheral rebate 11 co operating with the rebate 10 on the housing portion 1. There is further provided an end recess 21 to allow access to the underside of the tray 5. A pair of longitudinal ribs 22 are provided to support the window element 3, Catch members 24 are provided to co operate with snap figures 25 see Figure 10 on the tray 5.The window element 3 comprises a flat window portion 26 see also Figure 9 and a domed window portion 27 respectively visible through the apertures 7 and 6. Around the periphery of the underside of the domed window portion 27 there is an annular skirt 28 which tapers somewhat in a downward direction.The lateral edges of the window portion 26 are provided with down turned ribs 29 which fit on the outside of the ribs 22 as indicated in figure 6.The backing disc 4 comprises a peripheral rebate 31 which is tapered and receives the skirt 28 as an interference fit.A motif bearing card 32 is shown as sandwiched between the domed window portion 27 and a flat surface 33 of the backing disc 4. The backing disc 4 is also provided with a reinforcing rib 35 which engages on the inner surface of the rear housing portion 2.The tray 5 comprises a card receiving recess 41 provided with retaining lugs 42. The tray also including a through hole 43 in continuation of the hole 8 in the housing member 1 so that the flexible retaining member also serves to prevent inadvertent removal of the tray without removing the tag from the bag or case. In order to enable the tray to be firmly tugged to release the snap fingers 25 from their catch members 24, a pair of finger grips 44 are provided on the underside of the tray, and these are accessible through the gap 21. The edge of the gap 21 in the rear housing member 2 is provided with a rebate 45 co operating with a matching rebate 46 on the tray.The various mouldings 1, 2, 3,4 and 5 are separately manufactured and also the motif bearing cards 32 are separately prepared.Fairly short productiion runs may be required for the motifs so that the tags may be manufactured with a desired number of tags with any given motif, but using common parts for the moulding. In assembly, the motif 32 is placed on the flat surface 33 of the moulding 4 and the domed part 27 of the window element 3 is introduced over It, in the appropriate orientation, so that the skirt 28 engages the rebate 31, which has previously been provided with a layer of a suitable solvent adhesive to retain the two parts together in a sealing manner. This provision of a skirt sealingly engaged in a rebate provides for adequate protection of the motif from seepage of water beneath the domed portion 27, as the skirt extends for the whole 3600 around the motif and is sealingly received by the rebate. The sub assembly of window portion 3 and backing disc 4 is then located on the rear housing portion 2. The backing ring is secured by adhesive to an upstanding arcuate rib 47, and the ribs 29 are secured by adhesive to the ribs 22. The front housing portion 1 is then secured to the rear housing portion 2 by means of adhesive between the rebates 10 and 11, and further security may be provided by the provision of solvent adhesive between the flanges 6a and 7a and the respective corresponding portions 27 and 26 of the window element 3.As previously stated, the tray is slidingly received and clipped in position by the co operating catch members 24 and snap fingers 25 and may be removed by means of the finger grips 44. An appropriate identification label is provided within the tray area 41 beneath the lugs 42 and may be replaced readily by removal of the tray to gain access to the tray area 41.Various modifications may be made within the scope of the invention.
