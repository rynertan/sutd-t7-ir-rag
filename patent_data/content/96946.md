# METHOD FOR PROCESSING OF BY PRODUCTS OF THE REFINING OF OILS AND FATS

## Abstract
To avoid environmental objections in discarding by pro ducts of refining and processing of fatty oils, fats or mineral oils, or other materials, especially those containing alkali metal ions or salts, such by products are combusted with excess air or oxygen, preferably in a fluidized bed oven, using a bed ma terial having a low silicon content, particularly those consisting mainly of titanium, calcium and or aluminium oxides, at 600 950 C, preferably 800 850 C. The organic materials in the by products are thereby converted into products which can be discharged without problems the exhaust gases contain only low amounts of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. By passing the combustion gases through a heat exchanger, the heat generated can be used. e.g. to preheat the excess air for the process or to generate steam or heated water, which can be used economically in other parts of the plant. The process is particularly suitable for the combustion of soapstock, the water content of which has been reduced, e.g. by evaporation, if necessary.
