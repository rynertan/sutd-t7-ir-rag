## Description
A PROGRESS AID APPARATUS TO DISPLAY RATHER SUPERFICIALKEOFORMATIOKS PPESENT IN SOME PARTS OF THE BODY BY USINGAT LEAST ONE LIGHT SOURCE .This invention relates to a process and apparatus to display rather superficial neoformations present in some parts of the body by using at least one light source accordingly handled.The dimensions of this apparatus are reduced, so that the apparatus is portable. This apparatus is particularly useful for family doctors carrying out their activity with limited diagnostic means outside of large cities. To said doctors the assisted clients first apply for any sanitary problem, for example when they have palpated or seen more or less painful suspicious neoformations on the skin or in the subskin, in the mammary gland, at the level of the penis and so on.The doctor, essentially alone, estimates the neoformations with his own harts and sight, often he seeks advice from specialists who however use bulky, sophisticated and expensive equipments.Particularly, referring to the mammery gland test, just consider the apparatus for mammography, which uses radiological apparatuses and is therefore dangerous both to the specialist and to the patient, in addition to being sophisticated and expensive and accordingly located in very few equipped centers. All of this involves appointments and thus time and anxiety both for the assailed person and physician. other 1C1o r type of of apparatus provides the use of ther nography using the different thermal gradients to display the abnormal zones. Also this apparatus is particularly sophisticated as it must detect and display temperature gradients in the order of tenths of degree.The apparatus using light sources for examining parts of the body are at present extremely rough. The known type of apparatuses provides a battery which is used to illuminate a cavity of the human body such as, for example, the mouth or the ear interior. In this case the light is not focussed.Other apparatuses comprising a light beam of variable amplitude are known, said beam being directed towards the part of the body to be examined, in particular the nEnnEutb gland.This type of apparatus provides the use of only one lens to collimate the light beam rays. It does not comprise however an beam focussing meant towards particular zones of the parts to be examined. Therefore only insufficient information about the observed shade can be obtained and other apparatuses are necessary to know something more it does not comprise any internal heat retaining layer. Therefore, It cannot operate for a long period because of the expensive heating caused by the Permanently switched on lint. Therefore, it is the object of the present inventich to provide a process which enables to ermine rather superficial zones of the body by using only an accordingly handled light, i.e.focussed and possibly coloured, so as to get the maximum number of information related to the benign or malignant nature of the superficial zones of different density if compared with the surrounding tissue, and accordingly illuminated, without resorting to more expensive and dangerous apparatuses. The apparatus to carry out said process, should be used and readily operated by the family doctor. It should be also harmless and of moderate cost.It is an auxiliary object to use this apparatus for early diagnosis and prevention of benign or malignant nature of rather superficial neoformations, above all if related to the mammary gland, so as to enable the physician to immediately express a diagnostic orientation with some more data than those obtainable through only his sight and hands. This is particularly important for the patient from a psychological point of view.The obj ect has been achieved by providing a process to display rather superficial neoformations in some parts of the body, according to which a light beam. is focussed by a set of lenses or focussing means, so as to detect the density differences of the abnormal tissues by the sowed surraanding tissue.The apparatus for carrying out the process provides at least one light source and a focussing means comprising at least two lenses to address a light beat.. towards that part of the body to be examined. An embodiment of the invention provides that the light source is inserted in a container lined by at least one heat insulating layer suitable to retain the heat caused by said light source.A particular solution of the apparatus provides that the light source is inserted in a container lined by at least one layer of reflective material.Another embodiment provides that said apparatus comprises a camera for photographing the illuminated image.Another solution contemplates the provision of a metal net to be disposed next to the layer of reflective material.A preferred embodiment provides that the focussing means comprise a plano convex lens disposed between two biconvex lenses. By suitably varying the relative length between these lenses, the focus of said light sDurce can be modified. An improvement provides a duct for the cooling air inlet, preferably pressurlzec, and an air outlet duzt. A preferred solution provides at least a colour optical filter, placed at the focussing means so as to remove particular wavelengths of the light beam.A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described with referenze to the accompenying dra ings, in w1zich Fig. 1 is a view showing an embodiment of the apparatus as a whole andFig. 2 is a perspective sectional view taken along lines B B of Fig. 1.The portable apparatus according to the invention comprises a container 2 and a focussing part 6 accomodating the set of lenses. A switch not shown is provided at the end 3 of the container 2. The base for the lamp 8 is mounted at this end and provided with its clamp with several insulating layers. In this embodiment the lamp 8 is a halogen lamp. It has power of 100 W and is usually sold with a parabola end for directing the light towards the opposite side relative to the base. The focussing means is provided at the other end 7. It comprises a plano convex lens 11 interposed between two biconvex lenses 12 and 13. For focussing, the relative length between the lenses 11 and 12 is modified, as well as the length between the lenses 11 and 13, and 12 and 13.In this embodiment, the plano convex lens 11 is of the type sf l6,00, while the biconvex lenses 12 and 13 are of the type sf 10,00.However, the selection for the leus diopters would depend on the user s requirements and field to be il1utnThted. Downstream to lenses 12 and 13 colour filters 32 and for example iranifactured bS kr.IOO , are placed. They can have different colours. It is clear in fact that according to the different colours of the illuminated zones having different densities, it is possible to get information about the kind of the neo formation, since the colour of the incident light is modified, and then also the shade zones colour up differently. In this embodiment skin coloured and violet coloured filters have been used. The colour choice is however made by the doctor according to his needs and objects. The end 6a of the focussing part 6 is provided with a sloping end for adaptation thereof to the various parts of the body to be illuminated. Optionally, a camera 10 is provided which is suitable to expose on the film the image which is illuminated by the device.Particular care has been given to the design in order that this apparatus is not too much heating. Particularly, the container 2 has been suitably treated, that is lined or coated with several layers that are shown in Fig. 2. In this embodiment it is provided that the outer layer 20 of the container is of alluminum and 2 3 mm thick. Than a layer 21 is provided, cornprlscng reflective material, particularly tin foil paper, then followed by a layer 22 comprising insulating material. In this embodiment the insulating material comprises glass wool and is about 1.5 cm thick. It can be used an asbestos layer,which is less thick.This solution, is not shown. next, a layer of reflective material 23 is again provided, such as stIll nudie of tin foil paper, and then a metal net 2M for avoiding the unesired reflexes of the light which is to be focussed by the focussing means.The internal part of the device is entirely covered by asbestos, so as to reduce the external loss of heat.The embodiment in Fig 1 shows also an air inlet duct 30, preferably for pressurized air and a duct 31, preferably placed near the focussing means 6, for the cooling air outlet.A brass disc 34, drilled at the set of lenses, is placed inside said apparatus. It provides a better collimation or conveyance of the light rays towards the focussing means 6.In this embodiment the container 2 accomodating the light source and the part 6 accooddating the focussing means are distinct and cylindrically shaped. Particularly, for the container 2 the ratio diameter to length is 1 3, while for the focussing part the ratio diameter to length is 1 5. However, not necessarily the focussing part should always be outside the container, but could be provided inserted therein. To this end, technical expedients are adopted, which are well known to those skilled in the art, and which in any case do not allow the heating of the apparatus part contacting the patient s body.The whole portable apparatus is provided with a handle 4.To conform with ENTI standards, requiring that the apparatus should operate at 12, 24 V, it is therefore necessary toProvide a transformer in crder that the apperatus is supplied by the mains voltage, or a specifie power source anyhow making the apparatus independent of the mains supply. The wires at the outlet from the base of the lampholder and within the ontainer are insulated. It will clearly appear that the embodiment shown and described is only the presently preferred embodiment, while modifications can be provided to be made to the apparatus for better attaining the predetermined objects.
