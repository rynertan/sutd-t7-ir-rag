## Description
ANTIOXIDANT COMPOSITION SUITABLE IN SYNTHETIC LUBRICANTS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention This invention is directed to compositions and a method. More specifically this invention involves synergistic combinations of ingredients suitable for use as antioxidants in the stabi Jizution of snythetic lubricants and, to methods for the stabilization of such lubricants. Description of the Prior Art The current trend in automobile engine design has resulted in a subs tan tial increase in engine operating temperatures. This factor, together with longer recommended intervals between oil changes, has placed even greater demands upon the lubricants used in the engine operating enviornments.Moreover, the increasing utilization of diesel powered vehicles, and their concomitant higher operating temperatures, has further accelerated the need for development of more long lived lubricants. Various types of lubricants have been formulated to meet the increasingly demanding lubrication requirements of the engines referred to hereinabove. Many of these lubricants are synthetic products, thereby permitting more uniformity in control over their respective properties. Even these synthesized motor oils do, however, require the addition of certain additives to comply ment their intrinsic properties. A variety of additive packages are available for use in conjunction with such synthetic lubricants to extend their stability under the demanding operating conditions contemplated for their application. These additives are intended to enhance the synthetic oil s resistance to oxidation and to improve its thermal stability.Additives are also available to neutralize the corrosive by products of combustion, therm by preventing deterioration of metallic parts in contact with such corrosive agents and thus ensuring the maintenance of engine tolerances. The breakdown of a lubricant during severe operating conditions by one or more of the above degradative forces can also dramatically increase the lubricant s viscosity. An increase in the viscosity of iubricant.can result in restricted flow to berings inadequate lubrication upon starting and or inadequate cooling during engine operation. It is therefore apparent, that in order to achieve efficient engine operation and extended periods between oil changes, the lubricants used in modern eng nes must initially meet very strict and demanding requirements, and pe able to retain their original characteristics or characteristics as near their original charscteristicE as possible during their prolonged residence within the engine crackcase. Synthetic lubricants are currently available in today s market which purportedly satisfy the above stated conditions. Two such products are available fromR.T. Vanderbilt Company, New York City, New.York, under the trade name Vanlube 81 and Vanlube 82. These synthetic lubricants contain in addition to a synthesized base lubricating oil, an antioxidant composition comprising a diaromatic amine 4,4 di octyl di phenylamine and PBNA N phenyl 2 napthylamine . The cost of PBNA has risen substantially since its first introduction as a lubricant additive. Moreover, expressed concerns about PBNA as a potential carcinogen have prompted efforts in search for a substitute. Synthetic lubricants containing antioxidant compositions which are devoid of PBNA have been reported in the patent literature see UK Patent 1,358,045. The antioxidant composition described in 045 patent comprises a mixture containing a diamine of the formula.EMI2.1 wherein A is a benzene nucleus substituted in the para position with a tertiary alkyl group having 4 to 9 carbon atoms, and B is benzene nucleus which is substituted in the para position with respect to the nitrogen groups with a tertiary alkyl group having 4 to 9 carbon atoms, and an s triazine compound of the formula EMI3.1 wherein the R groups are hydrogen atoms or alkyl or aryl groups containing up to 20 carbon atoms per group with the provisos that at least one R group is a hydrogen atom and at least one R group is an alkyl C aryl group.One of the diamine compounds of the above formula, which is preferred by patentee, is derived from 4,4 di t octyldiphenylamine. The s triazine component of the above antioxidant composition must, for some undisclosed reason, have at least one unsubstituted hydrogen on one of the peripheral amino moieties and at least one R substituent on a peripheral amino moiety must comprise an alkyl or aryl substituent. Patentee also discloses that the s triazines of his antioxidant composition can include mono substituted melamines. As is apparent from the above discussion, the need for lubricants having enhanced stability to oxidative and thermal degradation is increasing. The lubricants of today and those needed in the future, must be capable of retaining their original functional attributes between extended oil changes and, in addition, be more efficient in maintaining particulates in suspension and the neutralization of delete rioussubstances e.g. corrosive agents such as acids generated during the combustion process. The way for achieving these objectives is believed to lie in the formulation of synthetic lubricants and the stabilization thereof with additive packages which are both relatively inexpensive to manufacture and innocuous to the environment.Moreover, the ability to realize such goals is dependent, at least in part, upon the development of additive combinations which tend to complement and or supplement each other, thereby reducing the overall concentration and cost of additives in the synthetic lubricants. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it is the object of this invention to remedy the above, as well as related deficiencies in the prior art. More specifically, it is the principle object of this invention to provide an additive package for use in lubricants which is effective for the enhancement of the lubricants resistance to oxidative degradation. It is yet another object of this invention to provide an additive package for use in lubricants.which is effective for the enhancement of the lubricants resistance to thermal degradation. Still yet a further object of this invention is to provide a composition containing a base lubricating oil which has been effectively stabilized against the degradative forces of oxidation. An additional object of this invention is to provide a composition containing a base lubricating oil which has been effectively stabilized against the degradative effects of high operating temperatures. Further objects of this invention include providing methods for extending the useful life of lubricants against the degradative forces of oxidation and high temperature. The above and related objects are achieved by providing a composition comprising at least one di aromatic amine compound of the formulaEMI4.1 wherein R , R and R are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen andEMI4.2 A is alkyl of 1 12 carbon atoms haloalkyl, aralkyl, mercapto or alkylmercapto X is alkyl of 1 12 carbon atoms and n is o or 1 with the proviso that where R , Ra and Rb areEMI5.1 n is O, or that where only R is n is 1 and at least one substituted melamine compound of the formulaEMI5.2 wherein Rc through Rh are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, and substituted aryl. The relative weight ratio of formula I to formula II compounds in the composition can range from about 10 1 to about 1 10. The above compositions are effective for the stabilization of base lubricating oils against oxidation and high temperature degradation.

As indicated hereinabove, the ingredients pre ent in the stabilizer composition can be preblended or combined by direct incorporation into the base lubricating oil. The efficacy of the stabilization additive package in the base lubricating oil is evaluated according to a modified Federal Test Method StandardNumber 791a, Method 5308.5 July 27, 1964 . The test involves a high temperature 4200F oxidation test performed in the presence of air and S different metals e.g., copper, silver, magnesium, aluminum and steel.The test fluid di 2 ethylhexyl sebacate, available as Herculube A, from Hercules Chemical Company, Wilting ton, Delaware , containing the desired additives, is placed in a large test tube equipped with an air bubble a sample holder for the metals and a condenser. The assembled test tube is placed in a heated block and the temperature increased to the previously stated level.Air is then bubbled through the fluid at a rate of about 5 liters per hour over a 72 hour interval.
