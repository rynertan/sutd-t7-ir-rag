# Flame quality analysis.

## Abstract
A flame quality analyser for analysing one or more properties of a flame from a burner comprises a fibre optic array 32,33 including a plurality of optical fibres each having a light receiving end lying in a line and facing the flame. The line may extend parallel to the flame and burner axis array 32 or may extend perpendicular to that axis array 33 . The light received by the fibre optic array 32,33 is provided as a sheet of light to a monochromator which spreads the light into its component wavelengths. A pair of spaced apart arrays of light detectors is then utilised to measure the light at two discrete wavelengths. This detec tion produces signals that can be analysed to generate temperature and particles distribution values for the flame across its length or width.
