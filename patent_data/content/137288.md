# Integrated HF regeneration in aromatic hydrocarbon alkylation process.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for the production of alkylaroma tic hydrocarbons by the HF catalyzed reaction of an aromatic hydrocarbon with a Câ‚ˆ plus acyclic olefin. A portion of the HF used as a catalyst is regenerated by passage into a stripping column which has a primary function of stripping dissolved HF out of a hydrocarbonaceous mixture produced in the alkylation zone. This eliminates the requirement for a separate HF regeneration column and the costs associated with this column.
