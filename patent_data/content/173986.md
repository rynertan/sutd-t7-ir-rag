## Description
Method of and Device for the Recognition, without Previous Training, of Connected Words Belonging to Small Vocabularies Description The present invention relates to speech recognition systems, and more particularly it concerns a method of and device for recognizing, without previous training, connected words belonging to small vocabularies. Speech recognition can be faced either by means of a pattern matching approach, or by means of an acoustic phonetic analysis. The pattern matching approach is based on a previous storage of speaker dependent templates characterising overall acoustical events to be recognized and on the subsequent matching with the speech signal to be recognized. The main disadvantage of this approach is that templates storage requires an initial training phase which may be either on line in case of speaker dependent recognition or offline in ease of speaker independent recognition which is very timeconsuming and obviously requires high memory occupancy. On the contrary, acoustic phonetic recognition is based on the detailed determination of the acoustic phonetic features of the speech signal without requiring any previous storage of reference templates. This technique is generally used for large vocabulary isolated word recognition as a preliminary analysis, to simplify the subsequent pattern matching phase or is used in the continuous speech understanding domain as a preliminary analysis for classifying the sounds into fundamental phonetic classes, useful to the following step of recognition of individual phonemes belonging to these classes. An example of the latter application is described in the article by C.J.Weinstein et al., wA System for Aeousttc bonottc Analysis of Continuous Speech , IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, vol. ASSP 23, No. 1, February 1975, where the sounds are preliminarily subdivided into four fundamental phonetic classes, and afterwards hypotheses are made on the individual phonemes belonging to, these classes. Phoneme hypothesis reliability is not very high because possible misinterpretations are recovered during the subsequent higher level processing phases lexical, syntatic, semantic interpretation . The inventors have found that small vocabulary, speakerindependent words recongition does not require individual phoneme detection, but it requires only an accurate subdivision into phonetic classes starting from an acoustic phonetic word analysis hence this subdivision is the only step of the sound classification process. The present invention concerns a small vocabulary word recognition method, which, on the basis of the acoustic phonetic analysis of the uttered sounds, subdivises them into eight main classes, plus an indication of the presence of diphtongs. The class sequence is analyzed by a tree search algorithm of pattern matching with sequences of classes corresponding to the words of the vocabulary, and possibly by dynamic programming algorithms. Such a method is described in claim 1. It is a further objet of the present invention a device for implementing the method, described in claim 8. The method, object of the present invention, is hereinafter described. The signal is subdivided into subsequent intervals and each interval is classified into one of the following eight phonetic classes hereinafter labelled by symbols written on the right of each of them silence Q, voiced fricative Fv, unvoiced fricative Fn, plosive P, affricate A, nasal N, semivowel S, vowel V with possible diphtong detection . A recognition method of the words forming the speech signal is applied to the obtained class sequence. Provided the vocabulary of the words which can be recognized is conveniently chosen, the above subdivision into 8 classes issuf ficient to recognize each possible sequence of said words in a speaker independent mode. The subdivision into eight phonetic classes is carried out as hereinbelow described. First the speech signal is subdivided into equal time inters vals and digitised, obtaining, at each interval, N digital saup sn l n N . A linear prediction coding LPC is applied to the digital samples 5n of each interval. In other words, at each interval, linear prediction coefficients al,....ai, ap of the following function are determined EMI3.1 where z indicates digital sample z transform, H z the transfer function defining the vocal tract model, at each interval by an all poleXdigital filter P l i P the digital filter order. The values pi of the following normalized autocorrelation function are thus determined EMI4.1 Values pi are then used to resolve the following linear system of i equations EMI4.2 The linear prediction coding technique is known and described in the book by L.R.Rabiner, .W.Schafer Digital Processing of SpeechSignals , pages 396 and ff., Englewood Cliffs, Prentice Nail, 1978. Normalized residual energy ER is calculated at each interval using values ai, pi as follows EMI4.3 Further the values of the formant frequencies Fr, i. e. the resonance frequencies of transfer function H z defined by relation 1 are calculated. Values Fr are given by the peaks of function R z calculated point by point and by applying known parabolicinterpolation techniques. To ensure a sufficient continuity between the formants calcu latex at adjacent intervals, known formant tracking techniques are used, which replace formant values which greatly differ from those of adjacent intervals by interpolated values. These formant computing techniques are described, e.g. in the book by J.D.Markel, A.H.Gray Jr. Linear Prediction of Speech , Berlin, Springer Verlag, 1976, page 165 and following. Together with the preceding operations, always using linear prediction techniques applied to low pass filtered digital samples Sn, the speech signal of each interval is classified as voiced or unvoiced, by applying the algorithm known in the technique by the acronymSIFT Simplified Inverse Filter Tracking which consists of the following steps digital samples are low pass filtered and then sub sampled equations 2 , 3 , are applied again to the sub sampled signal, thus obtaining new pi, aj values the sub sampled signal is further digitally filtered according to the inverse transfer function referred to as inverse filter of re lation 1 , and using the just computed coefficients ai, thus ob tianing the residual signal rx, with x identifying the sample of sub sampled digital signal lexCM , the autocorrelation function Rx of residual signal rx is computed EMI5.1 Rx peaks are looked for and compared with a threshold a signal SF is generated indicating threshold exceeded if at least one of said that peaks of Rx exceeds threshold threshold exceeded refers to a voiced sound, the opposite to an unvoiced. The algorithm is of known type, as described e.g. in fia above cited book by J.D.Markel, A.H.Gray, page 197 and following. Together with the preceding operations, fast Fourier traBsw form is computed of the digital signals sn of each interval, to de termine the following energy values referred to an interval total energy ET extended to overall frequency band of the origi aai signal energy EM of the intermediate band energy EH of high frequencies energy EL of low frequencies. Then each interval is classified as silence Q or voice by applying the following algorithm a reference energy value is calculated ERIF t a ET ETI , where ET is the total energy, ETI is the ini tial mean total energy extended to the first five intervals consi dered, which hence takes into account background noise, and a is a constant factor residual energy ER is compared with ERIF if ER ERIF the interval is classified as silence Q. Ratio RwEL EH between the energy at low and high frequencies is calculated and then compared with a threshold. Then a subdivision is effected into four levels indicating the voicing degree of the speech signal at each interval, starting from the analysis of signalSF, and ratio R, according to the following table EMI6.1 tb SEP R SEP SF SEP Speech signal tb SEP voicing SEP degree tb Threshold SEP exceeded SEP Threshold SEP exceeded SEP Voiced SEP signal tb SEP SEP SEP SEP not SEP SEP Quasi SEP SEP tb SEP not SEP SEP SEP SEP exceeded SEP Quasi SEP unvoiced SEP signal tb SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP not SEP SEP Unvoiced SEP SEP tb Starting from the energy at high frequencies of the preceding interval EH j l and of the subsequent interval EH j l , the valueSSF j is computed of the spectral stability function defined by the following formula 10 log E H j l 10 log E H j l SSF j 6 10 log E i j l 10 log E j l where j is the interval index C and 6 are two constants. Value SSF j is compared with a threshold and the intervals at which the threshold is exceeded are considered as the start points of sounds such as Fv, Fn, P, A. In a limited neighborhood j N, j N of each of said intervals taken as references and denoted by index j, a check procedure is effected to establish which of the following conditions has taken place most of the previous intervals j l,,,j N have been classified as a silence Q b voiced or quasi voiced signal VNV most of the subsequent intervals j l,...j N have been classi fied as c unvoiced or quasi unvoiced d voiced or quasi voiced e quasi voiced or quasi unvoiced in most of the subsequent intervals total energy ET has a value which, if compared with a threshold E1, is f ET El g ET E1 in interval j total energy ET has a value which, if compared with a threshold E2 E1, is h ET E2 i ET E2 Upon the check of these conditions, the following possible indications of phonetic classes are emitted for interval j and the following an indication of voiced fricative class Fv if the following cond1 tions are met a , d , h or b , d , or a , e , h or b , e an indication of unvoiced fricative class Fn for the following conditions a , c , f or b , c an indication of plosive class P for conditions a , d , i or a , e , i an indication of affricate class A for conditions a , c , g Once identified, one of said indications is maintained for a number of intervals, starting from interval j, determined as follows the indication of class Fv is maintained up to the interval in which condition i takes place again the indication of class Fn is maintained up the interval in which condition d occurs again the indication of class P lasts for an only interval if it has been detected with conditions a , d , i otherwise it is maintai ned for all the intervals in which conditions e is present the indication of class A is maintained up to the interval in whi ch condition d occurs again. For sequences of interval not classified as Q, Fv, Fn, P, A, a search is effected for possible minimum energy values in the intermediate band EM an algorithm known in the art as DIP search algorithm is used as disclosed for instance in the above mentioned paper by C.J.Weinstein et al. According to this algorithm a linear interpolation is performed among contiguous values EM j by a smoothing function to smooth the instantaneous peaks in the values of EM, which peaks are not significant to the search for the above minima, obtaining, for said sequences of intervals, a smoothed mean energy function E j . Then the trend in time of the values E M j is considered maxima and minima are searched for, and the ratios between a minimum and each of the two adjacent maxima are calculated if even only one of the two ratios is greater than a fixed threshold, then in the neighborhood of the interval corresponding to the minimum of EM, a nasal sound N or a semivowel sound S identified. To decide whether the sound is N or S, the duration is considered of the time interval in which the differences between the energy values and the minimum, are within a certain range. If said duration exceeds a certain threshold, in the pertaining intervals the sound is classified as N, otherwise it is classified as S. The other intervals of these sequences which are classified neither N nor S are classified as V vowel . If the number of consecutive intervals classified as V is greater than a threshold, a search procedure is activated for possible consecutive vowels diphtongs . To this aim the trends are considered, during said sequences of intervals, of the interpolated values of the lowest formant frequencies Fr. If said trends present constant regions whose mean levels differ from one another by values greater than a threshold, each of said regions detects a vowel. The values of said levels are used then also during the word recognition step. The method used for word recognition basically employs known algorithms, such as tree search, pattern matching and dynamic programming algorithms, as described e.g. in the paper by J.S.Bridle,R.M.Chamberlain, M.D.Brown An algorithm for connected word recognition , International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and SignalProcessing, pp. 899 902, Paris, May 1982. Class sequences comprised between two sufficiently long silence periods are investigated by these procedures. Some indications of classes lasting for too small a number of consecutive intervals are eliminated in each of said class sequences0In fact, statistically, the indications of classes Fv, Fn, V, A, whose duration is too short correspond to classification errors. Then within said sequences, equal consecutive classes are united under a single indication, with the exception of diphtongs or different consecutive vowels, for which as many consecutive indications V are maintained as are the vowels, thus obtaining reduced sequences of classes. For example the reduced sequence QFnV1V2Q is derived from the possible following class sequence QQQQ FnFnFnFnFn Vlvlvlvlvl V2v2V2V2V2 QQQQQ, Each reduced class sequence S L , where L is the number of symbols, is analyzed by the pattern matching search algorithm which compares it with sequences corresponding to words of the vocabulary, till similarity is found with at least one of them under the hyphotesis made of a limited vocabulary the sequence found out is the only one possible. If on the contrary no matching is found out, the entire reduced sequence is analyzed by applying dynamic programming algorithm which searches for an acceptable class sequence having the minimum distance from that under test.If this distance is less than a fixed threshold, the sequence is recognized as valid, otherwise it is not. An example of limited vocabulary may be the sequence of digits 0, 1 , 9 . In the Italtan language, for digit representation, the following graphemes pertaining to the following classes are to be used EMI10.1 tb Class SEP SEP SEP Gra SEP hemes tb Fv SEP Z,V SEP tb Fn SEP s tb P SEP d,t,q tb A SEP c tb N SEP n tb S SEP r tb V SEP a,e,i,o,u SEP tb In addition the following correspondence is obtained between digits and reduced class sequences EMI11.1 tb SEP Digit SEP Reduced SEP class sequence tb ZERO SEP FvVSV tb UNO SEP one SEP VNV tb DUE SEP two SEP PVV tb TRE SEP three SEP PSV tb QUATTRO SEP four SEP PVVQPSV tb CINQUE SEP five SEP AVNQPVV tb SEI SEP six SEP FnVV tb SETTE SEP seven SEP FnVPV tb OTTO SEP eight SEP VPV tb NOVE SEP nine SEP NVFvV tb If the classes are correctly identified any digit sequence can be recognized. The only ambiguity might arise in the identification of digit sequence due, tre or digit quattro in fact in both cases there is the reduced class sequence PVVQPSV. In this case, however, it is sufficient to check the distance between the values of formant frequencies Fr of the two underlined vowels the distance must be below a fixed threshold in one case due, tre , because the same vowel is present, while above the threshold in the other quattro because the vowels are different.

Said content is the result of the addition performed by SM1 at the preceding interval. When the enabling on wire 25 isove, at RG2 output initial total energy value ETI will be present. At each interval said value is subtracted in a subtract or SM2 from the value of total energy ET present on connection 9. The subtraction result is supplied on connection 27 to multiplier ML1 which multiplies it by the constant value a available at the output of memory element MM. The multiplication result is the value of reference energyERIF which is supplied through connection 28 to an input of majority comparator CMP1 which compares it with the value of residual energyER it receives at the second input from block RE Fig.l through connection 5. On output wire 17 of CMP1 a logic 1 is present if ER ERIF condition corresponding to the classification of the interval as silence Q , otherwise a logic O will be present. All the blocks of Fig. 2 are synchronized by intervalfrequency signal present on wire 3. In Fig. 3 reference RQ denotes a register reading from bus 19, carrying the data coming from memory MEM1 Fig. 1 , the field of each data word carrying the indication silence voice. The indication of silence sets output Q, while the indication of voice sets output Q. RSF denotes a register reading from bus 19 the field of data words carrying information on whether spectral stability threshold has been exceeded. When signal Q is active, RSF outputs are activated more particularly, the threshold exceeded indication sets output SF, while the indication threshold not exceeded sets output SF. Registers RQ, RSF are synchronized by clock signal OK. IND1 denotes a first addressing unit for memory MEM1, allowing the reading of silence voice field of the addressed words, which field is then memorized in RQ. IND1 comprises an up down programmable counter, which is synchronized by clock signal CK and which usually counts up on the contrary when it receives a pulse on wire 3 it decrements the counting by one unit. In addition said counter is stopped when signal Qis active, and is programmed at the address value present on bus 20 when the output signal of OR gate P5 is active. IND1 emits as adresses on bus 20 the counting values, while at each counting increment it emits a pulse on wire 30. IND2 denotes a second addressing unit for memory MEM1, which allows the reading of data word fields relating to identification of sounds Fv, Fn, P, A, which fields are supplied to blocks FPA and DUR through the respective wires of data bus 19. IND2 comprises an up down programmable counter, synchronized by clock signal CK, which emits the values counted on bus 20 as addresses For MEM1. Said counter begins counting up when output SF ofRSF is set, provided the counter is not inhibited by a signal coming from block 1ND3 through bidirectional connection 31. On the contrary, when it receives a pulse on wire 2,decrements the counting by a unit. At each activation the counter executes two consecutive countings the first is an up counting by 2N l units and starts from the value present on bus 20 at the activation instant decremented by N the second counting starts from the value present on bus 20 at the activation instant and is incremented till an end of counting signal arrives on wire 32. IND2 supplies block IND3 with an inhibition signal, through connection 31, during its operation. Moreover, it supplies on connection 33 the values counted to block FPA and to block DUR during the first and the second of the two consecutive countings, respectively said values perform as synchronism signals for the operations of blocks FPA, DUR. IND3 denotes a third addressing unit for memory MEM1, allowing the reading of the fields of the data words relevant to the identification of sounds V, N, S, which fields are supplied to block VNS through the corresponding wires of data bus 19. IND3 comprises a programmable up down counter s wkich is synchronized by clock signal CK and emits the values counted on bus 20 as addresses for MEM1. Said counter starts counting up when output SF ofRSF is set, provided the counter is not inhibited by the inhibition signal supplied by IND2 on connection 31. As long as IND3 operates, it emits on the same connection 31 the inhibition signal for IND2 and on connect ion 34 the values counted, acting as activations for the operations of block VNS. IND3, receives control signals for up or down counting or pause through connection 34 from block VNS, from which it also recei ves via wire 35 a signal of end of operation determining stopping of the counter. Also the counter of IND3 decrements the counting by a unit when it receives a pulse on wire 3. VNS denotes a block carrying out the functions of identification of sounds V, N, S. It receives through bus 19 the bits of the following fields of data words silence Q, spectral stability threshold, values of formant frequencies Fr, values of smoothed mean energy function E M and relevant indications of maximum and minimum points. VNS is activated by the signal received from block IND3 through connection 34, whereon it supplies also the control signals for the counter of IND3, and is synchronied by clock signal CK. VNS supplies on the outputs S, N, V, D the indtcations of semivowel, nasal, vowel, diphtong, respectively, and for eacb interval identified by one of said classes emits a pulse on wire 36 In addition it emits the end of operation signal on wire 35 which signal is carried to block IND3 and to an input of gate P5 said signal is generated in correspondence with the interval and hence of the data word in which signals Q or SF become active again. VNS implementation is not a problem for the skilled in the art person, once its functions, discussed above as well as during the method description, are known. VNS may be, e.g. implemented with a known type microprogrammed structure, provided its computing rate is compatible with realtime processing sequirements. FPA denotes a block checking the occurrence of conditions a, ...i, described in the method, for detecting sounds Fv, Fn, P, A. To this aim it receives the fields of data words present on bus 19,.rele vant to silence, comparisons with energy thresholds E1, E2, and voicing degrees further it receives the values counted by IND2 via connection 33 FPA emits the indications of occurrence of conditions a, ,i on the homonymous wires on connection 37. An example of embodiment of FPA will be described with reference to Fig. 4. LGC denotes a combinatory logic emitting on connection 38 signals indicating voiced fricative Fvl , unvoiced fricative Fnl , plosive P1, P2 , affricate A1 class, combining the indications of occurrence of conditions a, ...i, it receives on connection 37 as indicated in the following truth table corresponding to the method described above of emission of phonetic class indications EMI19.1 tb SEP 37 SEP 38 tb a SEP b SEP c SEP d SEP e SEP f SEP g SEP h SEP i SEP Fvl SEP Fnl SEP P1 SEP P2 SEP A1 tb 100100010 SEP 1 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 tb 100010010 SEP 1 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 tb 01010 SEP 1 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 tb 01001 SEP 1 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 tb 101001000 SEP 0 SEP 1 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 tb 0 SEP 1 SEP 1 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP 0 SEP 1 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 tb 100100001 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 1 SEP 0 SEP 0 tb 100010010 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 1 SEP 0 tb 101000100 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 1 tb In the table, 1 indicates condition occurred , 0 condition not occurred , donut care . The plosive class indication is carried by two signals, P1 relating to the type of plosive sound lasting one only interval, P2 relating to the occurrence of condition e . By using the truth table above, every skilled in the art person can implement block LGC. The signals indicating classes coming from LGC, before being carried to block ELB Fig. 1 , are supplied to block DUR which deter mines the number of consecutive intervals identified by the class received by LGC through connection 38. DUR receives from bus 19 the same data as block FPA and from connection 33 the values counted tt IND2. DUR, when enabled by IND2, emits the class indications on the outputs denoted by the same class symbol Fv, Fn, P, A on the basis of the corresponding class signals received from LGC besides, it emits on wire 39 a pulse for each interval identified with that class. At the end of.the operations, DUR emits a pulse on wire 32, which is connected to blocking input of IND2 and to a P5 input to restart INDO. An example of embodiment of block DUR will be described in connection with Fig. 5. The pulses present on wires 30, 36, 39 are combined by logic gate P6 so as to supply on wire 40 a pulse for each interval identified with any class. BT denotes a conventional time base generating clock signalCK for all circuits of CLSS. BT is blocked during all the periods in which the signal on wire 3 is active, i.e. during the data writing phases in MEM1 Fig. 1 . Besides, at the beginning of the proceduresBT remains blocked for a determined number of pulses present on wire 3. The indications of classes of the outputs of RQ, VNS, DUR and the signal on wire 40 are supplied on bus 21 which is connected to block ELB Fig. 1 . In Fig. 4 CA, CB, , C1 denote nine conventional counters checking conditions a, b, ...i, respectively. Said counters, when enabled, count the pulses received from block DIN. Enablings for the counters are obtained by the following combinations of the data present on bus 19 for counter CA, level 1 of voice silence field on wire 171 for counters CB, CD level 1 of the higher weight bit of the field of voicing degree over wire 162 for counter CC, instead, level 0 of said bit for counter CE, logic EX OR, executed in gate P4, of the two bits of the voicing degree field present on wires 161, 162 for counters CF, CG logic levels 0 and 1 of the field of com parison of energy ET with threshold E1, present on wire 151 for counters CR, CI logic levels 0 and 1 of the field of com parison of energy ET with threshold E2, present on wire 151 . DIN separates the counting pulses received through connection 33 over wire 41 it supplies the pulses from j N to j 1 , where J is the value present on bus 20 Fig. 3 at the beginning of IND2 counting over wire 43 pulse t over wire 42 pulses from j 1 to j N . Upon reception of pulse j N DIN supplies on wire 44 an enabling signal which performs also as a reset signal for all theCounters. When enabled, counters CA, CB count the pulses on wire 41 counters CC, CD, CE, , CF, CG those on wire 42 counters CH, CI those on wire 43. Since on wire 43 a single pulse takes place, counters CH, CI, when enabled, supply it to the output on wires 52, 53 respectively. Counters CA,...., CG instead supply a logic 1 on the output, on wires 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51 respectively, if they reach counting value N 2 1, i.e., half plus 1 received pulses. Signals on wires 45,...., 53 are applied to the inputs of register RG3 which supplies them on bus 37 when it receives the enabling signal on wire 44. In Fig. 5, RG4, RGS, RG6, RG7 denote four registers which, when enabled by the pulses on wire 33 pulses relevant to the second of the consecutive countings executed by block IND2 of Fig. 3 , supply to the outputs the signal applied to the inputs, connected to wir.c 60, 61, 62, 63, respectively. Register outputs carry sound class i. cations, and pulses on wire 33 determine the number of intervals during which said indications are valid. Register RG4 supplies the indication of class Fv if and as long as the signal on wire 60 is active, which signal is supplied ty the output of gate P11 executing the logic AND of signal Fvl, coding through bus 38 from logic LGC Fig. 3 , and of signal on wire lgs belonging to bus 19. Register RG5 supplies the indication of class Fn if and as long as the signal on wire 61 is active, which signal is supplied by the Output of gate P12 which executes the logic AND of signal Fnl, coming from bus 38, and of the complement value of the signal on wire 162 coming from bus 19. Register RG6 supplies the indication of class A, if and as long as the signal on wire 62 is active, which signal is supplied by the output of gate P13, which executes the logic AND of signal A1, coming from bus 38, and of the complement value of signal on wire 162. Register RG7 supplies on wire 65 one of the two possible indications of plosive sound if and as long as the signal on wire 63 is active, which signal is supplied by the output of gate P14 which executes the logic AND of signal P2, coming from bus 38, and of the output of gate P10, which executes the logic EX OR of signals on wires 161, 162 coming from bus 19. Signal P1 coming from bqs 38, and the signal on wire 65 are supplied to OR gate P15 which emits the indication of class P. The signals on wires 60, .... 9 63, and signal P1 are applied to the inputs of register RG8, synchronized by the pulses on wire 33.RG8 emits a signal on wire 32, active when input signals are no longer active. The signal on wire 32, when active, stops the counter of Ins2, emitting the pulses on wire 33. The signals of class Fv, Fn, A, P, are also carried to the inputs of register RG9, which emits on wire 39 the pulses present on wire 33 when one of the indications of such classes is active. The operation of circuit CLSS of Fig. 3 will be now described. At the beginning of the procedures time base BT generates signal CK with a delay of a certain number of intervals so as to allow an initial partial filling of data word memory MEM1 Fig. 1 . Then, the counter of IND1 begins addressing MEM1 as long as the silence voice field of data words indicates silence, register RQ supplies indication Q on bus 21, to which IND1 counting pulses are also supplied through wire 30, gate P6 and wire 40, which pulses determine the number of intervals characterized by class Q. All the other circuits of CLSS remain deenergized. When, on the contrary, the silence voice field indicates voice, output W of RQ activates register RSF and stops unit IND1 if spectral stability of data word present on bus 19 indicates spectral stability threshold exceeded, the output SF will be active and will activate addressing unit Ins2 otherwise output SF will be active and will activate addressing unit IND3. If unit IND2 is activated, then the search for sounds Fv, FnP, b begins. IND2 inhibits IND3 through the signal on connection 31, up to the end of the search. IND2 counter addresses data words in MEM1 from position j N to j N where j is the address present on bus 20 upon iND2 activation data words are supplied to circuits FPA and LGC activated by the first counting sequence supplied on connection 33. At the end of said first sequence, a combination of conditions a, ...i, decoded by LGC into one of the possible class indications supplied on bus 38, is present on output bus 37 of FPA. Then circuit DUR is energized by the second counting sequence supplied by IND2 on connection 33. As long as DUR is active, it emits one of classes Fv, Fn, P, A on bus 21, on the basis of the analysis of the data words present on bus 19, and emits in addition on wire 39 the pulses of the second counting of IND2, which pulses determine the number of intervals identified by the relevant class, and are supplied on bus 21, through gate P6 and wire 40. when DUR detects the end of the class found out, it stopsIND2 counting by a signal on wire 32, which determines also reactivation of IND1 which begins again addressing MEM1 Fig. 1 from the value present on bus 20 at that instant. Operation control is then taken again by register RQ as disclosed above. When output Q is active, RSF is activated again, and IND1 is stopped. When output SF is active, addressing unit IND3 is activated. 1ND3 inhibits IND2 through connection 31 till the operation end, activates block VNS through the signal on connection 34, and addresses MEM1 starting from the address present art the activation on bus 20.The addressed data words are supplied to VNS which, on the basis of their analysis,emits the indications of classes V, N, S, and of dipthong D on bus 21 VNS emits also the pause or down up control signals for IND3 counter on connection 34 and the pulses indentifying the intervals classified V, N, S on wire 36 connected to bus 21 through gate P6 and wire 40. When VNS detects the presence of class Q or spectral stability threshold exceeded, it stops IND3 and reactivates IND1 through the signal on wire 35. Control is then taken again by unit IND1, as already described. It is worth noting that active logic level on wire 3 which condition occurs at each writing in MEM1 of a new data word determines the temporary stopping of time base BT and consequently of all synchronized circuits of CLSS besides in the addressing units it causes the decrement by a unit in the counter active at that instant to take into account the shift by a position of data words in MEM1, caused by the new writing. Variations and modifications could be made to the example of embodiment described while remaining within the scope of the invention.
