## Description
AMBIENT TEMPERATURE REPAIR OF ELASTOMERIC ARTICLES HAVING A HOLLOW OR DEFORMITY THEREIN TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a composition and method for repairing reinforced elastomer articles having a hollow or deformity, E.G. a cut or cavity therein. More specifically, the present invention relates to the utilization of a patch in association with the elastomer article and an amine curable polymer or prepolymer optionally having rubber particles therein which is cured at ambient temperatures. A gum rubber can also be utilized but must be cured. BACKGROUND ART Heretofore, reinforced rubber articles such as tires having a cut or opening therein have been repaired generally by filling the cut with uncured rubber. Such a repair required a source of heat to cure the rubber and the formed repair usually had a short life. If the opening extended through some of the cords or through the entire tire, a patch was generally used. That is, an uncured rubber compound was first added to the aperture or hole and then cured with heat. Next, the patch area, for example the inside of the tire, was buffed. An uncured patch was then positioned and cured with heat. This repair route was not only long and tedious, but required the utilization of heat, usually a tire mold, and the like. Thus, except for a chemical cure patch, an on the spot or in situ repair could not be made, nor could repair be made at an ambient temperature.Moreover, the chemical patch method generally resulted in low or poor adhesion.

Fig. 3 relates to a cross sectional view showing the repair of a reinforced, elastomeric article having an aperture therethrough, according to the present invention utilizing a rubber filler therein Fig. 4 relates to a cross sectional view showing the repair of an elastomer article having a cut therein, according to the present invention utilizing a rubber filler therein Fig. 5 relates to a cross sectional view showing the repair of a reinforced elastomer article having a cavity therein, according to the present invention utilizing a rubber filler therein Fig. 6 relates to a cross sectional view showing the repair of a reinforced elastomeric article having a hollow extending completely therethrough, according to the present invention and Fig. 7 is a cross sectional view showing the repair of a similar reinforced elastomeric article wherein the hollow extends only partially therethrough. PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS According to the concepts of the present invention, a reinforced elastomer article having a hollow therein is repaired in association with a cured rubber patch. The hollow, that is the recess or void exists in the article and extends at least into the reinforced area such that some of the cords, that is at least approximately 25 percent, are damaged, broken, or severed. When the hollow extends only into the cord area, a cavity is formed in the article. When the article extends entirely through the article, an aperture is formed. In either case, an amine curable polymer or prepolymer is applied to the hollow and to a space between the rubber elastomer and cured rubber patch. Cure occurs at ambient temperature. SUBSTATE ELASTOMERS According to the embodiment of Fig. 1, article 10 has hollow 12 in the form of an aperture, or the like and extends clearly therethrough. The article to be repaired, or substrate, is a cured rubber or elastomer, having unsaturated groups therein. The substrate typically has cords 14 therein. The.sub strate can be any conventional elastomer or rubber known to those skilled in the art. For example, it can be made from conjugated dienes having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms such as butadiene, isoprene, and the like. It can also be made from natural rubber, that is from a substance which is obtained from various trees and plants which grow in the tropics or desert portions of the world.Such natural rubber generally has in excess of 90 and usually in excess of 95 percent of cis 1,4 polyisoprene content. The substrate may also be various elastomeric copolymers such as those made from monomers of conjugated dienes having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms as set forth above, and vinyl substituted aromatic compounds having from 8 to 15 carbon atoms. Examples of such vinyl substituted aromatic compounds include styrene, alpha methylstyrene, and the like. An example of a specific copolymer is styrene butadiene rubber. Naturally, other types of rubber compounds can be utilized such as the so called butyl rubbers, neoprene, that is polychloroprene, and the like, as well as blends of said above rubbers. ELASTOMER PREPARATION The preparation of such above noted various elastomers is well known to the art. The article to be repaired is often in the form of a tire, especially an off the road tire, a conveyor belt, or any rubber article having a hollow therein. Regardless of the type or nature of the article in which the elastomer exists as a cured form, it is desirable to clean the surface to which the amine curable polymer is to be applied. Cleaning can take place as through a physical treatment of the area to be repaired, for example, as through buffing or through skiving, that is cutting and removing a portion of the surface.Another method involves the use of any conventional organic solvent to remove dirt and residue. Typical solvents include acetone, or ethyl acetate. As apparent from the drawing, the area which is typically cleaned involves aperture 12, the area adjacent to patch 20 and the patch as well. Thus, the aperture may be difficult to clean by physical means, can be cleaned by utilizing a solvent whereas the bottom portion of the article can be buffed. To ensure removal of all loose rubber, the buffed portion can then be cleaned with a solvent. TREATING AGENTS To the cleaned surfaces are applied a coating of various treating agents 30 which have been found to imrvrove adhesion between the substrate and the amine curable polymer or prepolymer 40. Suitable treating agents include the various N halohydantoins, the various N haloamides, the various N haloimides, and combinations thereof. Examples of various desirable N halohydantoins include 1,3 dichloro 5,5dimethyl hydantoin 1,3 dibromo 5,5 dimethyl hydantoin 1, 3 dichloro 5 methyl 5 isobutyl hydantoin and 1, 3 dichloro 5 methyl 5 hexyl hydantoin. Examples ofN haloamides include N bromoacetamide and tetra chloroglycoluril. Examples of N haloimides includeN bromosuccinimide and the various chloro substituted s triazinetriones, commonly known as mono , di , and trichloroisocyanuric acids. A preferred treating composition for use in the practice of the present invention are the various mono , di , or trichloroisocyanuric acids, or combinations thereof. Tri chloroisocyanuric acid is especially preferred. APPLICATION OF TREATING AGENTS The treating agents usually exist in solid form. They are readily soluble in solvents such as acetone and the like and thus can be applied in liquid form. Application of the treating agent generally occurs at ambient temperatures. Application can occur through any conventional manner as through brushing, spraying, and the like. The amount applied is such that the rubber substrate surface is coated.Preferably, two or more coats of the treating agent or adhesive compound is used to ensure that all the cured rubber substrate surface has been coated. TYPICAL AMOUNTS OF TREATING AGENTS A typical amount of the treating agent in the suitable solvent, for example ethyl acetate or acetone is generally from about 0.1 to about 10 percent by weight based upon the total weight of said treating agent and solvent, and preferably from about 0.5 percent to about 5 percent. Of course, higher or lower concentrations can be utilized. This solvent system has been found to dry within a matter of minutes so that the amine curable polymer or prepolymer can be bonded thereto. It is thought that the adhesive treating system adds halogen groups, for example, chlorine to the cured rubber which activates the cured rubber surface allowing the amine curable polymer or polymer system to adhere strongly to the cured rubber surface. AMINE CURABLE POLYMERS OR PREPOLYMERS Of the various amine curable polymers or prepolymers, the urethanes are preferred. Other prepolymers or polymers which can be cured with the amine curing agent include the compounds set forth inU. S. Patent No. 3,755,261 which is hereby fully incorporated by reference. Briefly, such compounds are the various epoxy resins such as those disclosed in the Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology Interscience Publishers, New York 1967 , Volume 6, pages 2 12 221 halogen containing hydrocarbon polymers such as chloroprene polymers, chlorinated butyl rubber, and chlorinated polyethylene and polypropylene chlorosulfonated polymers such as those described in U. S.Patent No. 2,723,257 polymers containing acid halide groups suchEMI12.1 and haloformate groupsEMI12.2 polymers containing anhydride groups which on reaction with diamines yield amide acid linkages, and organo polysiloxanes as described in U. S. Patent No. 2,938,010. TYPICAL URETHANE POLYMERS OR PREPOLYMERS The urethane prepolymers or polymers, that is those which contain isocyanate groups, are generally formed by first reacting a polyether polyol or a polyester polyol with a molar excess of a diisocyanate to form a prepolymer having terminal isocyanate groups. The polymer is then cured to increase its molecular weight from less tha about 3,000 upwards to over 10,000. Examples of such polymers are set forth in U. S. Patent Nos. 2,620,516 2,777,831 2,843,568 2,866,774 2,900,368 2,929,8.00 2,948,691 2,948,707 and 3,114,735, all of which are hereby fully incorporated by reference.Typical specific examples of such polyurethanes include Adiprene L 367, polytetramethylene ether glycol containing approximately 6.4 percent isocyanate end groups by weight, manufactured by DuPont AdipreneL 42, polytetrÅamethylene ether glycol containing approximately 2.8 percent isocyanate end groups by weight, manufactured by DuPont and Cyanaprene A 7, a polyester based coating polymer with approximately 2.4 percent isocyanate end groups, manufactured byAmerican Cyanamid. Blends of these polyurethanes can also be utilized. Moreover, it has been found, particularly with repair or application of the amine curable polymer to the patch area, that is the area between patch 20 and cured substrate 11, better adhesion is often obtained by utilizing two different types of urethane.For example, a urethane containing a high amount by weight of isocyanate end groups such as Adiprene L 367 can be blended with a urethane containing a low amount by weight of isocyanate end groups such as Adiprene L 42. The amount of one urethane to the other can range from about 1 to about 99 percent and desirably from about 30 to about 70 percent by weight. AMINE CURING AGENTS To the amine curable prepolymer or polymer compound is added a conventional amine curing agent, known to those skilled in the art. Generally, any conventional or known amine curing agent can be used and, thus, only a few specific examples will be given. Thus, the curing agent can be MOCA, that is 4,4 methylene bis 2 chloroaniline or, desirably a complex of 4,4 methylene dianiline and a salt, or a complex of racemic 2,3 di 4 aminophenyl butane and a salt, as set forth in U. S. Patent No. 3,755,261 toVanGulick which is hereby fully incorporated by reference. The latter two complexes are preferred. The methods for preparing the complexes are set forth inU. S. Patent No. 3,755,261. A preferred salt utilized with the 4,4 methylene dianiline compound is sodium chloride or lithium chloride.Due generally to availability and costs, the complexes or salts derived from 4,4 methylene dianiline are highly preferred. Another class of amine curing agents which can be utilized are the various Versamides, that is the condensation products of polyamines and dibasic acids obtained when certain unsaturated fatty acids are polymerized, and are manufactured by HenkelChemical Company. EQUIVALENT WEIGHT OF AMINE CURING AGENTS Equivalent weight of the curing agent utilized with regard to the curable prepolymer or polymer, including the amine curing agent, generally ranges from about 85 percent to 115 percent with from about 95 to 105 percent being preferred. Often to facilitate processing, the. curing agent, and especially an amine curing agent such as the complex of 4,4 methylene dianiline and a salt is utilized with a plasticizer such as dioctylphthalate on a So percent weight basis, or Flexol 4 GO, tetraethylene glycol bis 2 ethyl hexanoate manufactured by Union Carbide Corporation on a 50 percent weight basis. The amount of plasticizer can range from about 20 percent to about 60 weight percent. BLENDING OF CURING AGENTS WITH POLAR SOLVN The curing agent is blended with the prepolymer or polymers in various mixers such as dough mixers, high speed impellers, paddle type mixers, and the like. Small batches can be mixed by stirring with a spatula. Usually, the prepolymer or polymer is a liquid. If not, when mixed with the polar solvent, a liquid mixture results. However, even if a solid curing agent is used, when added to the pre polymer or the polymer, and to a solvent system, a liquid system results even though the curing agent e.g., amine can be in the form of a dispersion.Thus, even though the system may contain solids therein, the solids exist in the form of a dispersion so that a liquid system is produced. AMOUNT OF POLAR SOLVENTS The curing agent and the amine curable polymers or prepolymers form the curable polymer system which is mixed with a polar solvent so that a liquid system is obtained which cures at ambient or room temperature, that is, the prevailing temperature as from about 10 0C to about 50 C. Often the ambient temperature will range from about 15 0C to about 35 0C or 406C. The polar solvents which can be utilized, especially with the amine curing agent and the amine polymers or prepolymers are, for example, set forth in U. S. Patent No. 3,888,831 to Kogon which is hereby fully incorporated by reference.Generally, the amount of solvent utilized per 100 parts by weight of the curable prepolymer or polymer ranges from about 2 to about 40, desirably from about 2 to about 20, and preferably from about 5 to about 15 parts by weight.Specific examples of preferred solvents include dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, cyclohexanone, ethyl acetate, nitromethane, nitroethane, nitropropane, methyl ethyl ketone, and acetone. Acetone and methyl ethyl ketone are highly preferred. The amount of curing agent, based upon said polymer or prepolymer, ranges from about 0.85 to about 1.15 equivalents. PATCH CONSTRUCTION Considering patch 20, it can generally be of any desired size so long as it is greater in surface area than the aperture adjacent thereto. Typically, the surface area of the patch is at least twice as great as the aperture. Generally, an appropriate patch size will be known to one skilled in the art of patch construction and or patch application. The patch is made of rubber and is generally fully cured.Although cured natural rubber or a composition containing at least 80 percent by weight of natural rubber is often preferred, any conventional type of cured rubber compound can be utilized. Thus, the patch can be made substantially from a conjugated diene having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, copolymers made from conjugated dienes having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms with vinyl substituted aromatics having from 8 to 15 carbon atoms, for example styrene butadiene rubber, and the like. In essence, the patch can be made out of the same type of rubber as the substrate. Often, the patch will have a cushioned layer thereon to alleviate stresses formed between the tire carcass and tire patch. Since in the preferred embodiment of the present invention the substrate has cords therein, desirably the patch also has cords therein. Although the number of the cords can range from a small number to a very large number, the strength of the cords in the patch is generally at least equal to the strength of the preinjured damaged cords contained in the substrate. More specifically, whenever approximately 25 percent to about 50 percent of the cords are damaged, severed, broken, etc., the strength of the cords in the patch is approximately equal to the strength of said cords before being damaged, etc. However, should approximately 50 percent to 100 percent of all the cords be damaged, severed, or otherwise injured, the strength of the cords in the patch is equal to the strength of the total cords in the article before any injury thereto.Should the number of damaged cords in the article be less than approximately 25 percent, then, the strength of the remaining cords is usually adequate such that a reinforced patch need not be utilized. The cords in the patch can be made of polyester, nylon, steel, rayon, and the like, with nylon being preferred. It has been found that according to the present invention, large apertures extending through a cured rubber substate can be repaired up to approximately eight inches in diameter. Generally, any rubber article having an aperture therethrough can usually be repaired by the present invention. Specific examples include conveyor belts, tires, especially off the road tires such as those utilized for front end loaders, mining equipment machines, and the like. A repaired article having a hollow in the form of an aperture is shown in Fig. 2. An amine cured polymer or prepolymer, as for example a urethane cured polymer 40, fills the aperture. It also forms a good adhesive bond with treating agent 30 which in turn coats the aperture 12 of substrate 10, patch 20, and the adjacent article area. The amine cured urethane extends through the aperture and into the patch area, that is the area juxtaposition to the patch or located between the patch and the substrate.In this area, a good bond is also formed such that the patch reinforces the substrate. When the rubber article is a tire, usually the patch area is buffed sufficiently to remove surface contamination. The inner liner should at least be buffed and in some cases removed to the tie gum layer in order to obtain a fresh surface. Occasionally, it is desirable to even remove one or two of the cord plies in order to ensure a fresh surface for bonding. Reinforcing patch 20 can contain a plurality of cords therein, generally approximately equal in strength to the total number of cords in the tire to be repaired. The patch is coated with the treating agent and then coated with the amine curable polymer or prepolymer. The patch is then taped into place over the aperture area. The patch is also held in place by inflating a curing tube located inside the tire.With the aperture of the tire located in the uppermost verticle position, the amine curable polymer or prepolymer is poured into the aperture until it is filled. Of course, the aperture has previously been coated with the treating agent. The top of the aperture is then taped and the amine curable polymer in the patch area and in the aperture is allowed to cure at ambient temperature. Taping of the aperture area retains the polar solvent such as acetone which promotes curing of the polymer. In a variation of this procedure, the amine curable polymer is applied to the patch area and then the patch applied thereto. The patch is taped into place and the polymer is allowed to cure. Next, the amine curable polymer is separately added to the aperture so that it is filled and then taped thereover. The aperture portion of the repair is then separately cured at ambient temperatures. The end result by either method is a repaired article having much better strength and durability than that repaired according to heretofore conventional methods that are performed on site. In the embodiment of Fig. 2, the hollow is in the form of a cavity wherein some cords of the reinforced article have been damaged, severed, or the like. Usually, at least 25 percent of the cords have been broken, damaged, etc., and the article is repaired utilizing a patch. Either the cavity can be filled or the patch applied first. In repair of cavity 112, treating agent 130 is applied to all surfaces thereof. Then, the cavity is filled with amine curable polymer 140, generally to the level of the substrate. Naturally, in this operation, the cavity is located in the uppermost vertical position of the article. As before, the tape is then applied over the filled cavity to promote curing of the polymer.Cure occurs at ambient temperature. The patch area is prepared as before by cleaning and even buffing down to the tie gum layer and even to the cord ply layer. Treating agent 130 is applied to the patch area of substrate 110 as well as to one side of patch 120. Amine curable polymer or prepolymer 140 is then applied to the treated side of the patch, with the patch in turn being applied to the treated portion of substate 110. The ends of the patch can be taped to the substrate or held in place with a curing tube located inside the tire. The number of cords of the patch is as previously set forth.That is, if less than 25 percent of the cords are damaged, the use of the patch having cords therein is optional. When approximately 25 to about 50 percent of the cords are damaged, severed, etc., the strength of the cords in the patch is at least equal to the strength of such cords before being damaged. When approximately 50 percent or more of the cords are damaged, injured, broken, etc., the strength of the cords in the patch is equal to the strength of the total number of cords in the substrate before any injury thereto. The repair is then cured at ambient temperature. In forming the amine curable polymer system, generally the amine curable polymer or prepolymer is mixed with the polar solvent and then the curing agent is added last. During cure, an effective and strong bond is formed between the prepolymer or polymer system and the treated elastomer substrate.Since the present invention relates to an ambient temperature, repair of large and cumbersome articles such as off the road tires, conveyor belts, and the like, can be made in situ. In other words, the repair can be made at the job site. The only accessory which may be required is a tire bladder, although a sand bag can be used. In such a situation, the repair can be made at the local tire repair shop.Since the cure is ambient, no steam chambers, or other vulcanizable tire repair equipment are required. This, of course, also results in an energy savings. It is to be understood that various conventional additives in typical amounts can be added to the amine curing agent and prepolymer system such as colorants, softeners, fillers, antioxidants, plasticizers, and the like. The invention will be better understood by reference to the following representative examples. EXAMPLE 1 A damaged off the road tire, having the injury through the innerliner, was repaired as follows.The damaged area was skived out, making sure to remove all of the damaged area, body plies, and lug areas. The repair area was then buffed to an RMA num 3 or 4 buff rating. The innerliner was also buffed.In most cases, the innerliner must be at least removed to the tie gum. In some cases, removal of one or two of the body plies was necessary in order to get a good fresh surface for bonding of the reinforced patch. Once both areas have been buffed, they were thoroughly washed with a solvent, normally acetone on a piece of Rymplecloth. The acetone was allowed. to dry thoroughly. Application of several coats of a 3 percent trichloro s triazinetrione in ethyl acetate follows the washing procedure. This likewise was allowed to dry thoroughly. Installation of the reinforcing patch was preferably done first.This was accomplished by mixing a polyurethane repair kit comprised of the following two components. COMPONENT A COMPONENT BAdiprene L 42 150 grams Caytur 21 72 gramsAdiprene L 367 150 gramsFlexol 4GO 30 gram Acetone 30 grams The thoroughly mixed polyurethane was then coated onto a reinforcing patch that was fully cured and contained no uncured gum layer. The patch was buffed, washed and primed with the 3 percent trichloro s triazinetrione prior to the application of the polyurethane. After the patch was coated, the buffed portion of the innerliner was also coated.The polyurethane was allowed to thicken to a nonflowing material before installation of the patch to the innerliner was carried out. The patch was taped in place and then held permanently in place by inflating a curing tube inside the tire. After the.patch was secured, the tire was rotated 1800 so that the aperture was at the top of the tire. Additional polyurethane repair material was poured into the aperture until completely full. The surface of the repair was covered with tape in order to keep the fluid material in place and allow the acetone to remain in the formulation long enough to fully cure the system. After standing 24 hours at ambient temperature, the tape was removed from the aperture and the curing tube and tape were removed from the innerliner position of the tire. The tire was ready to be placed back into service The above procedure was performed on a 37..25 x 35 scrapper tire. The size of the injury was a 4 inch inside diameter on the innerliner and 10 1 2 inch outside diameter on the exterior tread surface. The injury was located in the crown area. AROCO 7 patch was used Rocson, Inc., Copley, Ohio .The patch was fully cured. After the tire was prepared, it was placed back into service. The repaired tire lasted 342 hours before a small air leak occurred. RUBBER FILLERS According to other concepts of the present invention, an elastomer article having a deformity therein is substantially filled with an amine curable polymer or prepolymer. If the deformity is a cut, the amine curable polymer or prepolymer has a rubber filler therein. If the deformity is a hollow such as a cavity or an aperture, a cured elastomer patch is utilized in association with the repair and is located juxtaposition to said aperture. See Figs. 3, 4 and 5. The amine curable polymer or prepolymer in the hollow area will have a rubber filler therein. However, such polymer or prepolymer when utilized in the patch area will have no such filler. In either situation, cure of the amine curable polymer occurs at ambient temperature. Generally, the article to be repaired has cords or reinforcement therein. When the article has a hollow therein, that is a recess or void, such hollow extends at least 25 percent into the reinforcement area such that some of the cords are broken, severed, damaged, or the like. When the hollow so extends only into the cord area, a cavity is formed in the article. When the hollow extends entirely through the article, an aperture is formed. Considering an elastomer article having an aperture therethrough, as shown in Fig. 3, the article is generally indicated by the numeral 100. The article or substrate can be an elastomer of tne type set forth above. Aperture 120 extends entirely through the article. The article to be repaired, or substrate is a cured rubber or elastomer having unsaturated groups thereLn.. M.The.ar.ticlest.ypically has cords 140 therein. In the embodiment of Fig. 4, a cured rubber article having unsaturated groups therein is generally indicated by the number 1000.The cut area 1120 has a treating agent 1300 thereon.The cut is substantially filled with said amine curable polymer or prepolymer. In the embodiment ofFig. 5, cavity 2120 extends into the reinforcement portion of the article, generally indicated by the number 2000. Article 2000 also has unsaturated groups therein. Regardless of the nature of the opening, the substrate can be any conventional elastomer or rubber known to those skilled in the art and as set forth herein above. The article such as a tire is cleaned in a manner as set forth above, which is hereby fully incorporated by reference, that is through physical treatment, use of convention organic solvents and the like. To the cleaned surfaces are applied a coating of various treating agents 30, 130 or 230 which have been found to improve adhesion betwen the substrate and the rubber filled amine curable polymer or prepolymer 40, 140, or 240, respectively. Suitable treating agents include the variousN halohydantoins, the various N haloamides, the various N haloimides, and combinations thereof. Examp les of such treating agents are also set forth above and thus will not be repeated at this point. Application thereof is in any conventional manner and at ambient temperature, as set forth above. The amount of the treating agent is generally from about 0.1 to about 10 percent by weight based upon the total weight of said treating agent and solvent, with the preferred amount being as set forth above. With regard to the various amine curable polymers or prepolymers, they are the same as set forth above. Similarly, the amine curing agents have also previously been set forth as has the equivalent ratio as the use of a plasticizer. The blending of the amine curing agent as well as the ambient curing temperature range has also been described. Along with the amount of the solvent. An important aspect of the present invention relates to the use of a rubber filler 500 in the amine curable polymer or prepolymer to repair aperture 120. As previously noted, the patch area preferably does not have any rubber fillers therein since such fillers will appreicably weaken the adhesive bond of the amine curable polymer or prepolymer. Moreover, cut 1120 and cavity 2120 do have a rubber filler in the amine curable polymer or prepolymer.Filler 500, 1500, or 2500 is preferably a cured rubber and is in the form of particles. Desirably, the particle size can range from about 10 millimeters to about 0.01 dust size and preferably from about 1.0 millimeter to about 0.01 millimeter dust size .Generally, any type of synthetic rubber can be utilized as the particle filler so long as it is an unsaturated rubber. A class of suitable rubber compounds include the same types of rubbers as that utilized in the article or substrate 100 or 1, That is, conjugated dienes having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, natural rubber, typically containing in excess of 90 to 95 percent cis 1,4 polyisoprene, copolymers made from dienes having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms and vinyl substituted aromatics having from 8 to 15 carbon atoms, for example, styrene butadiene rubber, the various types of nitrile rubber, polychloroprene, and the like. Although saturated type rubbers can also be utilized, the unsaturated types give better adhesion and thus are preferred. The cured rubber source can be any conventional or common source such as ground tire scrap, ground rubber scrap, ground tire tread, and the like. The rubber source can also be in the form of a powder such as that obtained by buffing a tire. As shoud be apparent, such sources are very economical and will generally include specific rubbers such as polybutadiene, natural rubber, styrene butadiene rubber, synthetic polyisoprene, and combinations thereof. The amount of rubber utilized in the amine curable polymer or prepolymer ranges from about 10 to about 75 percent by weight, and preferably from about 40 to about 50 percent by weight, with an optimum amount being approximately 43 percent by weight based upon the total amount of said amine curable polymer or prepolymer and said cured rubber particles. Generally, the addition of the rubber particles to the amine curable polymer or prepolymer will make such polymer softer as well as reduce its modulus. The hardness of the amine cured polymer or prepolymer 400, l400, or 2400 containing rubber particles therein in aperture 120, cut 1120, or cavity 2120, respectively, can thus be varied by the type of rubber utilizied as well as the amount thereof.Depending upon the repaired article, a desired hardness of the cured rubber amine cured polymer or prepolymer mixture will vary. It is desirable that the hardness of the rubber particle amine cured polymer or prepolymer mixture is generally similar or equal to that of substrate 100, 1000, or 2000. With regard to a tire, such hardness generally ranges from about 40 to about 90 on the Rockwell Shore A hardness scale, and preferably from about 60 to about 70. The low strain Ibs, in. modulus will generally range from about 25 to about 500, and preferably from aobut 50 to about 75. Not only does such rubber particle amine cured polymer or prepolymer mixture result in improved performance with regard to a repaired article, but the material costs of the filled aperture is reduced. The cured rubber particles can be added to the amine curable prepolymer or polymer system at any stage and blended or rnixed therewith utilizing any conventional mixing device as for example a spatula, a mixer, and the like. The construction of the patch is as set forth above which is hereby fully incorporated.Thus, the patch can have any number of cords therein and the like. Generally, any rubber article having a cut, cavity, or an aperture therethrough can usually be repaired by the present invention. Specific examples include tires, especially off the road tires such as those utilized for front end loaders, mining equipment machines, and the like. Repaired articles are shown in the drawings. Fig. 3 relates to a tire having an aperture therethrough and is repaired utilizing patch 200. Patch 200 will have cords therein, not shown. Fig. 4 relates to an opening in the form of a cut as in a tire. The opening can be on the tread area or the sidewall. Fig. 5 relates to a cavity extending into cords 2140 of a tire. When the rubber article is a tire and the deformity is an aperture, as in Fig. 3, usually the patch area is buffed sufficiently to remove surface contamination. The inner liner should at least be buffed and in some cases removed to the tie gum layer in order to obtain a fresh surface. Occasionally, at times, it is desirable to even remove one or two of the cord plies in order to ensure a fresh surface for bonding. Reinforcing patch 200 can contain a plura lity of cords therein not shown , generally approximately in strength to the cords in the tire to be repaired. The patch is coated with treating agent 300 and then coated with amine curable polymer or prepolymer 400 having no rubber filler therein. The patch is then taped into place over the aperture area. The patch is also held in place by inflating a curing tube located on the inside of the tire.With the aperture of the tire located in the uppermost vertical position, the amine curable polymer or prepolymer having rubber filler 500 therein is poured into the aperture until it is filled. Of couse, the aperture has previously been coated with treating agent 300. The top of the aperture is then taped and the amine curable polymer in the patch area and in the aperture is allowed to cure at ambient temperature. Taping of the aperture area retains the polar solvent such as acetone which promotes curing of the polymer. In a variation of this procedure, the amine curable polymer is applied to the patch area and then the patch applied thereto. The patch is taped into place and the polymer is allowed to cure. Next, the amine curable polymer 400 having filler 500 therein is separately added to the aperture so that it is filled and then taped thereover.The aperture portion of the repair is then separately cured at ambient temperature. With regard to the embodiment of Fig. 4, article 1000 is rotated until the cut is located in the uppermost portion and then filled. The amine curable polymer 1400 having rubber fillers 1500 therein is preferably covered, as by tape, and allowed to cure at ambient temperature. Considering the embodiment of Fig. 5, it is similar to Fig. 3 in that the hollow, in the form of a cavity, is filled in association with a patch.More specifically, whenever approximately 25 to about 50 percent of cords 2140 are severed, broken, or otherwise damaged, the strength of the cords in patch 2200 not shown is approximately equal to the preinjury strength of the damaged cords. However, should the number of damaged, severed, or broken cords be approximately 50 percent to 100 percent, the total strength of the cords in the patch is approximately equal to at least the total strength of the cords in the article. The repair of an article having a cavity therein, such as in Fig. 5, generally proceeds in the same manner as in the embodiment ofFig. 3. That is, article 2000 is buffed or otherwise cleaned such that one or two of the cords are exposed. The patch area located juxtaposition to cavity 2120 is coated with treating agent 2300 as Is patch 2200.Then, an amine curable polymer or prepolymer is applied to the patch and the patch then applied to the article and held in place as by taping. The size of the patch is that as discussed above. As in the embodiment of Fig. 3, the article is then rotated until the cavity is in the uppermost position and then the amine curable polymer having filler 2500 therein is applied to the cavity which has previously been treated with treating agent 2300. The cavity portion is then taped and allowed to cure with the patch portion. Alternatively, the patch can be separately applied and cured as can the amine curable polymer or prepolymer filler mixture applied to the cavity. As noted above, when generally about 25 to about 50 percent of the cords are broken or damaged, the strength of the cords in patch 2200 is approximately equal to the initial strength of the broken cords. However, when approximately 50 percent or greater of the cords are broken, the strength of the cords of the patch is substantially equal to or greater than the total strength of cords 2140 in article 2000. The end result is a repaired article being prepared by an easier method and having equivalent or better strength and durability than that repaired according to heretofore conventional methods that are performed on site. Moreover, the hardness and or modulus of the repair is similar to the substrate and thus results in improved performance. In forming the amine curable polymer system, generally the amine curable polymer or prepolymer is mixed with the polar solvent and then the curing agent is added last. As previously noted, the rubber particles can be added at any stage. During cure, an effective and strong bond is formed between the prepolymer or polymer system with the treated elastomer.substrate and the previously cured rubber particles.Since the present invention relates to an ambient temperature, repair of large and cumbersome articles such as off the road tires, and the like, can be made in situ. In other words, the repair can be made at the job site. The only. accessory which may. be required is a tire bladder, although a sand bag can. be used. In such a situation, the repair can be made at the local tire repair shop. Since the cure is ambient, no steam chambers, or other vulcanizable tire repair equipment are required. This, of course, also results in an energy savings. It is to be understood that various conventional additives in typical amounts can be added to the amine curing agent and prepolymer system such as colorants, softeners, fillers, antioxidants, plasticizers, and the like. This aspect of the invention will be better understood by reference to the following relJresentdtiveb eXdlll ldS. EXAMPLE II An exterior cut in a tire 36.00 x 51 hauler tire OTR, off the road was repaired in the following manner using the composite type urethane repair.The cut commonly known as a spot repair was buffed thoroughly, making sure the injury was free of any loose rubber particles or cuts or gouges. It was buffed to an RMA num 3 or num 4 buff rating. The cut was washed thoroughly with acetone on a piece ofRymplecloth. The acetone was allowed to dry completely. The surface was then coated with several coats of a 3 percent trichloro s triazinetrione in ethyl acetate allowing each coat to dry before the next coat was applied. After the last coat had dried, a composite kit was mixed and poured or placed into the cut. The composite kit consisted of three components. COMPONENT A COMPONENT B COMPONENT CAdiprene L 42 Caytur 21 Treated Rubber 100 gm i4.3 gm 100 gm Flexol 4G0 10 gm Acetone 10gm The treated rubber was tread rubber from passenger and truck tires both natural and synthetic rubber that was graded to remove large chunks of rubber and then washed with acetone slurried , dried and treated with a dilute solution of trichloro striazinetrione in ethyl acetate slurried . The rubber was separated from the primer and dried overnight at room temperature and then at l000C for one hour. The mixing procedure consisted of mixing componet C with component A, thoroughly then mixing component B with the mixture of A and C. The mixed material was then added to the cut by means of a spatula. The surface was taped in order to promote the ambient cure by containing the acetone. The repair was allowed to cure for 24 hours at ambient temperature. After the required time of cure, the tape was removed and the tire was ready for service. After 973 hours of testing, the repair was better than a control. EXAMPLE III A 10.00 x 20 Load Range F, 8 ply, Transport 1 Truck tire having a 3 4 inch injury in the crown area and extending into the cord area was repaired as follows The injury was buffed to an RMA 3 or num 4 buff rating using a tungsten carbide tip tool. The innerliner was then buffed down to the top body ply in the same manner. The innerliner was buffed out only as large as the patch to be used. The patch was used as a template and was also buffed on the side to be adhered to the tire. All buffed areas were then washed thoroughly using acetone on a piece ofRymplecloth. The solvent was allowed to dry thoroughly 10 15 minutes .The buffed and clean surfaces were next treated with two coats of 3 percent trichloro s triazinetrione in ethyl acetate, allowing tht first coat to dry before the second coat was added. tie tch was sllso coated with two coats of the 3 percent trichloro s triazinetrione. The patch was installed first. A standard 50 50 kit was used. It contained the following ingredients Adiprene L 42 75 gm. Adiprene L 367 75 gm. Flexol 4GO 15 gm. A Side Acetone 15 gm. Caytur 21 36 gm. B Side The two sides, A and B, were thoroughly mixed and then allowed to thicken to a nearly non flowable state. At this point, the material was coated onto the patch Rocson Patch ROCO 8 4 and onto the innerliner area. The patch was put in place and held in position with tape. A tube was inserted and inflated to hold the patch in position and to apply pressure on it. The tire was then rotated so that the injury was located at the top. A composite system was mixed. It had the following formulation Adiprene L 42 25 gm. Acetone 2.5 gm. 4GO 2. gm. Ground Scrap Rubber Treated 25 gm. Caytur 21 3.6 gm. The ground scrap rubber was graded to a No.20 mesh, slurried with acetone, drained and dried.It was then treated briefly with a 0.25 percent trichoro s triazinetrione in ethyl acetate solution, drained, and dried at 100 0C for 10 minutes. It was stored in a jar and kept capped until used. The composite formulation was mixed thoroughly and placed into the injured area. The repaired area was covered with tape and allowed to cure for 24 hours at room temperature. After the 24 hour cure period, the tape and tube were removed from the tire. Both the patch and spot looked excellent.The tire was tested on a crown break test a stepwise increase in speed under a loaded condition . The tire ran 1,245 miles. It was removed at a duration of 3 hours at 70 mph. This was considered an excellent result for this type of severe test on a repaired tire. GUM RUBBER The instant invention is also useful in repairing reinforced elastomer articles with gum rubber wherein damage has been manifested as a chunk out, leaving a hollow area in the article. The injury may extend completely through the article or only through a portion thereof, but reinforcement, that is cords, belts, or the like, contained in the article will have been partially or completely severed thereby providing a weakened area. This aspect of the invention can be seen with reference to the figures. As is readily apparent, the salient features in each are identical except that the hollow 4120 in Fig. 7 does not extend completely through the substrate. For the sake of simplicity, all references to Figure 6 shall have equal reference to Figure 7, except for the dimensions of the hollow, as above. Referring then to Fig. 6, the article is generally indicated by th number 410, comprising a substrate 413 having embedded therein a plurality of reinforcement cords or belts 414, and a hollow 412. The substrate 413 can be any conventional elastomer or rubber known to those skilled in the art and having unsaturated groups therein. For example, it can be made from various dienes, vinyl substituted aromatic compounds, etc. as set forth above which is hereby fully incorporated by reference as is the preparation of such elastomers. The next step in utilizing this portion of the packing of a quantity of uncured gum rubber 422 into the hollow 412, most preferably from the outer surface defined as that surface of the substrate opposite where a patch 420 is later positioned. The gum rubber is then cured in placed using conventional means such as a pair of heated plates, otherwise known as spotters, one applied to the outer surface 424 and one to the inner surface of the substrate. The types of gum rubber which can be used are well known in the art, being generally composed of compounds of natural rubber or rubber blends and typically having other compounding ingredients such as sulfur, carbon black, accelerators, and the like.A variety of all purpose repair gums, readily available commercially, can be used. Alternatively, one skilled in the art can readily devise a suitable gum rubber recipe without undue experimentation. Once the gum rubber has been cured in place, the innerside is buffed around the now filled aperture and a treating agent 416 applied both to the substrate and the cured gum rubber surfaces, which should of course be first cleaned as outlined above.An amine curable polymer 418 is then applied to the inner surface after having been first allowed to thicken or partially set up , resulting in an increase in viscosity to several thousand centipoise. This results in a toothpaste like consistency helping hold the polymer in place while the patch is applied. The patch, after being buffed and having received a coating of treating agent 416, is then applied to the polymer surface. It is thereafter temporarily taped into place and held by some form of applied pressure, such as, in the case of a tire, a curing tube or a plurality of sand bags. The repair is allowed to set in this position for approximately 424 hours. The end result is a repaired article having much better strength and durability than one repaired according to heretofore known methods. In the embodiment of Fig. 7, the hollow 4120 in the article 4100 is in the form of a cavity wherein some cords 4140 of the reinforced article have been damaged, severed, or the like. Usually at least 25 percent of the cords have been broken or damaged and the article is repaired utilizing a patch. Either the cavity can be filled or the patch applied first. In repair of cavity 4120, the surface is first cleaned. The cavity is then filled with a gum rubber 4220, generally to the level of the substrate 4130. Naturally, in this operation, the cavity is located in the upper most vertical position of the article. The area to be patched is prepared as before by cleaning and even buffing, in which, in either embodiment, the tie gum layer or the cord ply layer can be exposed. Treating layer 4160 is applied to the patch area of substrate 4130 as well as to one side of the patch 4200. The amine curable polymer of prepolymer 4180 is then applied to the treated side of the patch, with the patch in turn being applied to the treated portion of substrate 4130. The ends of the patch can be taped to the substrate or held in place with a curing tube located inside the tire.The number of cords in the patch is as previously set forth. That is, if less than 25 percent of the cords are damaged, the use of the patch having cords therein is optional in that a solid rubber patch provides adequate reinforcement. When approximately 25 to 50 percent of the cords are damaged, severed or the like, the strength of the cords in the patch is at least equal to the strength of such cords before being damaged. When approximately 50 percent or more of the cords are damaged, the strength of the cords and the patch is equal to the strength of the total number of cords in the substrate before any injury thereto. The repair is then cured at ambient temperature. The type of suitable treating agents used, and typical amounts thereof are in accordance as set forth above and hereby fully incorporated. Simi larly, the type of various amine curable polymers or prepolymers, typical urethane polymers or prepolymers, amine curing agents, and the equivalent weight of amine curing agents is also set forth above. The above portion of the specification also sets forth the blending of the curing agents, i.e., polar solvents as well as the amount of solvent. Thus, once the bottom of the gum rubber is treated with the treating agent, the amine curable polymer or prepolymer is blended with a suitable amount of amine curing agent and a polar solvent is applied. The treating agent is also applied to the patch which is applied to the amine curable polymer layer. The entire patch amine curable polymer layer is then cured at ambient temperature. Considering patch 420, it can generally be of any desired size so long as it is greater in surface area than the hollow it seals. Typically, the surface area of the patch is at least twice as great as the hollow. Generally, an appropriate patch size will be known to one skilled in the art of patch construction and or patch application. The patch is made of rubber and is generally fully cured. A1 though cured natural rubber or a composition containing at least 80 by weight of natural rubber is often preferred, any conventional type of cured rubber compound can be utilized.Thus, the patch can be made from a conjugated diene having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, copolymers made from conjugated dienes having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms with vinyl substituted aromatics having from 8 to 15 carbon atoms, for example styrene butadiene rubber, and the like. In essence, the patch can be made from the same type of rubber as the substrate. Often, the patch will have a cushioned layer thereon to alleviate stresses formed between the tire carcass and the patch. Because the patch must provide structural reinforcement to the repaired article, it generally utilizes cords in the same manner as the article.Although the number of cords can range from a small number to a very large number, as above, they generally equal in strength the cords damaged in the substrate. Such a provision provides an adequate reinforcement for the article. The cords can be made of polyester, nylon, steel, rayon, or the like with nylon being preferred. It has been found that according to the present invention, large hollows can be repaired up to approximately 8 inches in diameter. In preparing the amine curable polymer system, generally the amine curable polymer or prepolymer is mixed with the polar solvent and thereafter the curing agent. During cure, an effective and strong bond is formed between the prepolymer or polymer system and the treated elastomer substrate.Since the present invention relates to an ambient temperature cure, repair of large and cumbersome articles such as off the road tires, conveyor belts, and the like can be made in situ. In other words, the repair can be made at the job site. The only accessory which may be required is some means for holding the patch in place while the polymer cures.As above, this can be an inflatable bladder or one o nlore sand bags. Since the cure is ambient, no steam chambers or other vulcanizing tire repair equipment is required other than that necessary to cure the bum rubber. This of course also results in energy savings. It is to be understood that various conventional additives in typical amounts can be added to the amine curing agent and prepolymer system such as colorants, softeners, fillers, antioxidants, plasticizers, and the like. This aspect of the invention will be better understood by reference to the following representative examples EXAMPLE IV Sidewall Section Repair An 11.00 R 24.5 steel radial truck tire containing two injuries in the sidewall was repaired as follows injury number 1 was 3 8 inches wide by 4 inches long after buffing with a tungsten carllde tip tool. The buffed area was cleaned with a rubber sol vent. The innerliner was then marked with an outline of the patch and likewise buffed with the tungstencarbide tool. Only the innerliner was buffed. The buffed areas were cleaned again with a rubber solvent and allowed to dry thoroughly. A coat of Firestone sSup R Tac rubber cement was applied to the buffed areas. It also was allowed to dry thoroughly.
