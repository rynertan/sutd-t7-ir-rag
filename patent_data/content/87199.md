# Device for generating audio information of individual characters.

## Abstract
A device for generating the audio information of a set of characters in which some characters are intoned or pro nounced with a different voice character. The device com prises means for making a distinction between a capital letter and a small letter presented. For a capital letter character, a speech pattern is formed in which the pitch or the voice character is modified, whilst maintaining their identity, with respect to a speech pattern for a small letter of the same character. The device also comprises means for determining the position of a letter, preferably the last letter, of a word composed of characters presented and for forming a speech pattern for the relevant letter in which the pitch or the voice character is modified whilst the identity is maintained.
