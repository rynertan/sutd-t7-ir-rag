# Method and compensation circuit for analyzers.

## Abstract
For compensating the fluctuation of the intensity of a light source or fluctuations caused by unclean windows of the cells in a probe analyzer system, and contrary to the intermittently operating conventional compensation technique, the invention uses at least one multiplying D A convertor 13 to which the measuring signal is applied and a further D A convertor 14 also of the multiplying type to which the output signal of a com pensating detector 12 is applied to which a monitoring light beam is impinging. A comparator 15 compares the output voltage Vâ‚€ of said further D A convertor 14 with a standard voltage E The primary advantage of the invention is a fast responding and long term correct compensation of the above mentioned fluctuation in spite of a possible de crease of the intensity of the light source or stains on the walls of the cells of a gas probe analyzer.
