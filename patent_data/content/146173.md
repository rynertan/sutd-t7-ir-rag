## Description
Mechanical unhairing machine for the carcass of a slaughtered animal. The invention relates to an unhairing machine for unhairing the carcass of a slaughtered animal, particularly a pig, which consists of a grid of par alley bars extending in planes lying transversely to the longitudinal axis of the machine to form a bed carrying the carcass, and also of a drivable shaft extending parallel to the longitudinal direction of the machine and provided with arms carrying beating means or scrapers in as many planes extending transversely to the longitudinal axis as there are openings between the grid bars, said beating means or scrapers extending above the bars of the grid and through the bars in order to be able to process a carcass lying thereon, the machine further being provided with a holding up means situated outside the operating circle of the beating means or scrapers, in a position situated opposite the beating direction of the beating means or scrapers. A machine of this kind is knoun from DOS 31 39 337. In this known machine the carcasses to be treated are deposited on the bed of the machine with their longitudinal axis parallel to the longitudinal axis of the machine, in a transverse direction relative to said longitudinal axis, with the aid of suitable transport means, said bed having upwardly extending grid bars. These upwardly extending grid bars can be swung aside, so that on termination of the treatment the carcass can be conveyed further in a transverse direction relative to the longitudinal axis of the machine and then conveyed out of the machine. At the point where the head of the carcass which is to be treated should be situated, this known macnine is provided with a holding up means. This holding up means can be knocked away through the action of the beating means, and in addition it has dimensions which are smaller than the trunk of the carcass. In this way it is intended to achieve better unhairing of the head part. This obviously has no effect on the remainder of the carcass. The invention seeks to provide a machine in which the unhairing of the carcass can be improved as a whole and the speed of passage can be increased. According to the invention this aim can be achieved in that the machine1 viewed in the longitudinal direction, has an inlet and an outlet, in such a manner that passage through it can be effected parallel to the longitudinal axis, and that the holding up means consists of a plate which, viewed in the direction of passage, covers at least a part of the grid bars and has a bottom longitudinal edge which adjoins the operating circles of the beating means or scrapers and from the bottom edge extends upwards along a path which is curved in cross section, thus restricting the freedom of movement of the carcasses away from the grid. According to the invention a plateshaped holding up means is thus used which extends over a part of the length of the grid.In view of the fact that the carcass travels through the machine in the longitudinal direction and not in the transverse direction, every part of the carcass will move through the zone where the holding up plate is situated. This plate presses the part of the carcass which is to be processed closer onto the beating means and the unhairing is therefore improved. With the arrangement according to the invention the carcass is thus subjected to the action of the holding up means over the entire length, so that better and at the same time quicker unhairing can be achieved. In addition, the legs of the carcass are prevented from being caught between the grid bars. The plate is preferably situated at the inlet part, so that a carcass newly arriving from a scalding tank can be immediately subjected to the action of the holding up plate. Unhairing machines through which carcasses travel in the longitudinal direction are known per se, and they have beating means which, viewed in the longitudinal direction, are disposed in succession on the shaft in such a manner as to have a pitch whereby a force component in the direction of passage is at the same time imparted to the carcasses treated by the beating means, so that conveying in the longitudinal direction is achieved. In these known machines with passage in the longitudinal direction the carcasses are often fed via a chute which, because of its slope, supplies a force component in the conveying or passage direction, whereby at the location of the pLate according to the invention the pitch of the successive beating means can be smaller than in places where no plate is provided, and can even be zero.The residence time in the plate section can thus be lengthened, while in the remaining section it can be shortened. The pLate may extend over the entire length of the grid, provided that the beating means produce a force component in the direction of passage or this is achieved in some other way. One suitable.possible method consists in that the entire machine is constructed with a downward slope, so that the carcasses move in the direction of passage from the inlet to the outlet through the action of their own weight. The beating means can then again have a smaller pitch or zero pitch. If use is made of a plate which occupies only a part of the length of tne grid, for example one third of the length, and if this plate is not placed at the inlet but further on in the machine, then at the location of the plate a smaller pitch or zero pitch of the beating means can once again be adopted, with a greater pitch upstream and downstream of the plate, viewed in the direction of passage. With the invention it is thus possible to produce a machine which, because of the plate, has an intensive unhairing zone determined by the plate and able to extend over a part or the whole of the length of the machine, as well as a part or arrangements which ensure longitudinal conveying. In addition, the plate ensures that a succeed ing carcass sliding into the machine will easily expel the preceding carcass. The invention will now be further explained with reference to the drawings. Figure 1 shows diagrammatically in perspective and partly cut away a part of an unhairing machine in accordance with the invention. Figure 2 is a view of the inlet side of the machine shown in Figure 1. Figure 3 shows diagrammatically the pitch pattern of the beating means in relation to the plate in one possible embodiment. The machine shown in Figures 1 and 2 has an inlet side 1 and an outlet to the left thereof at the site of the end wall 2. In the machine a main shaft 3 is mounted which carries sets of beating means 4 in successive planes lying transversely to the shaft 3. Rotation occurs in the direction of the arrow 5 Figure 2 . The machine is in addition provided with a bed of curved grid bars 6, which are disposed in successive transverse planes parallel to one another and spaced apart in such a manner that the beating means 4 move through and above them, as can be seen most clearly in Figure 2. In addition, a second shaft or auxiliary shaft 7 equipped with beating means 8 is also provided, these beating means likewise rotating in the openings between the grid bars 6 and projecting inwards with their operating circle outside the inner surfaces of the grid bars. Figure 2 shows the operating circles 9 and 10 respectively of the respective beating means 4 and 8, and it can be seen how these means project inwards out of the inner surface 11 of the grid bars. A carcass entering this machine will be rotated and lifted up through the action of the rotating beating means, so that the beating means or scrapers will always act on new surfaces of the skin, which has been prepared in a scalding tank, and will pull out the hairs. The beating means 8 act in the direction shown by the arrow 12, which is the same as that of the beating means 4. According to the invention a part of the grid bars which adjoins the operating circle 9 of the bottom beating means is now covered by a plate 13, which may lie entirely against the grid bars but, as indicated by the broken line 14, may also be curved further inwards. This plate 13 or 14 limits the freedom of movement of a carcass which, viewed in Figure 2, is to be moved upwards by the beating means 4 and pushed to the right by the beating means 8. More intensive unhairing is thereby achieved. The carcass moves over its entire length through the zone where the plate 13, 14 is situated, and is thus more intensively treated over the whole length. Figures 1 and 2 show the plate on the inlet side. This plate may extend over the entire length or may start some distance from the inlet and, if desired end some distance from the outlet. A longer residence time is desirable in the zone where the plate is situated, and thus the already intensive treatment is further intensified. As shown in Figure 1, this can be achieved by giving the beating means 4 a zero pitch or a far smaller pitch than beyond the plate. Figure 3 shows diagrammatically how the beating means 4 lying opposite the plate 13 are disposed with zero pitch, while the following beating means 4 have a normal pitch known per se. The sets of beating means are mounted on a shaft and can thus easily be adjusted to the desired pitch. On examination of Figure 3 it will immediately be clear that the plate 13 may also be disposed in the centre, and that the beating means upstream of the plate 13 and downstream of the plate 13, viewed in the direction of passage indicated by the arrow 15, can have a greater pitch than that of the beating means 4 situated in the region of the plate 13. The speed of passage can in addition be influenced by giving the machine as a whole a downward slope from the inlet 1 to the outlet this is of particular importance when the plate 13 extends over the major part or the whole of the length of the grid formed by the grid bars 6. A machine of this kind can be constructed with a considerably shorter length than known machines, but can nevertheless effect more intensive unhairing.
