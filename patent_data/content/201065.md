# VIRTUAL SINGLE MACHINE WITH LOGICAL RING AND WITH MESSAGE LIKE HARDWARE INTERRUPTS AND PROCESSOR EXCEPTIONS

## Abstract
A multi processor, multi tasking virtual machine comprises processes, messages, and contexts. Processes communicate only through messages. Processes may be grouped into contexts of related processes. Contexts may also be nested. Communication may be made between processes in different or related contexts, or at the same con text level, or between nested contexts. According to one message transmission mode, a message may be sent to each process with a given name within one context, thus ensuring that all processes with the same name at the same context level can be communicated with individually without knowing how many there are or where they are located. The virtual machine makes all hardware devices appear to be processes, in that the occurrence of an event on a device causes a message to be generated and sent to another pro cess for handling. The receiving process performs all operations required to handle the event. Thus a variety of hard ware devices can be connected and disconnected from the system without interrupting its operation and without necessi tating extensive software revisions.
