# Process for the preparation of aminopropylalkoxysilanes.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of aminopropylalkoxysi lanes comprising the hydrosilation of allylamines including N substituted allylamines with alkoxyhydrosilanes in the presence of a rhodium triorganophosphorus complex catalyst. This process significantly increases the gamma to beta isomer ratio of the final product of the addition of allylamines to alkoxyhydrosilanes.
