# Manually and electrically operated automatic hook lock.

## Abstract
The hook lock is particularly adapted for sliding gates where it may be fixed on the surface or within the gate itself. The lock comprises an electromagnetic solenoid 19 with related magnetic shell 17 , a cylinder lock 38 with key, a device in the form of a hook 4 and a system of five rocker levers 13, 16, 23, 26, 33 activated by a spring compressed plunger 3 , said elements arranged in a rectangular metal box 1 . The whole is assembled in such a way that every time the solenoid 19 receives an electrical impulse, the magnetic shell 17 is attracted and releases the system of rocker levers 13, 16, 23, 26, 33 . The combined action of the latter automati cally releases and raises the hook 4 the inverse blocking action occurs automatically when the gate closes. The lock is mechanically opened manually by using the appropriate key.
