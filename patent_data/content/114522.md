# ROM PROTECTION DEVICE

## Abstract
A ROM module 14 is coupled to a processor 10, which uses program and or data information stored in module 14. To protect the information from unauthorized copying, a key memory 11 in the processor 10 and a key memory 15 in the module 14 are arranged to store identical keys. Two encryption and or decryption units 12 and 16, in processor 10 and module 16 as shown, encode and decode information passing between the processor 10 and the module 14. The encryption and decryption may be applied to either the addresses sent to the module 14, the data coming from it, or preferably both. The key register 15 may be repeatedly writeable, in which case the initial data transference between the proces sor and the module must be the key transmission, without encryption. Alternatively, the key memory 15 may be once writeable, so that the module is useable only with a processor which is preset with the key.
