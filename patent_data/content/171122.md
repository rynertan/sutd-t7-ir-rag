## Description
LIQUID CLEANER Technical Field Liquid hard surface cleaners with excellent cleaning properties and high shine quality are prepared using mixtures of benzylalcohol and ethylenediamine tetraacetate. Background It is well known to use solvents. surfactants and builders generally. metal ion sequestrants in liquid hard surface cleaners to promote the cleaning function. However, equally important to the user of such products is their shine quality. i.e., the absence of filming or streaking on surfaces such as glass. stainless steel. mirrors. and the like. Most users tend to equate good cleaning with shine. but this is a mistake.Unfortunately, many cleaning ingredients leave unsightly.streaky deposits on surfaces. The present invention provides liquid cleaners that are characterized not only by their excellent cleaning properties, but also by their high shine quality. The compositions herein are particularly suited for cleaning glass, metal including automobiles , ceramic.high gloss paint. porcelain, and the like, surfaces where shine quality is important to the user. Summary of the Invention The compositions herein comprise a at least 2 , preferably at least 3.0 . ethylenediamine tetraacetate b at least 2 , preferably at least 2.59. benzylalcohol c the balance of the composition comprising water as the carrier liquid. and optionally containing detersive surfactants. pH adjusting agents. additional solvents. hydrotropes. and the like. all as described more fully, herein after. All percentages and proportions herein are by weight.unless otherwise specified. Detailed DescriPtion of the Invention The compositions herein are formulated to minimize. or preferably. to be substantially free. of many ingredients commonly disclosed for use in hard surface cleaners. For example, materials such as phosphates. citrates.nitrilotriacetates. gluconic acid and tartaric acid are preferably not used herein because they decrease shine quality. Likewise. nonionic surfactants are kept to a minimum. and the compositions use anionic surfactants at rather low levels 0.5 10 , generally 0.75S 2 . The present compositions contain benzylalcohol as a primary cleaning ingredient. The benzylalcohol is optionally. but preferably. used in combination with a CARBITOL Trade Mark . or CELLOSOLVE Trade Mark solvent. The carbitol solvents are of the 2 2alkoxyethoxy ethanol class. and the cellosolves are of the 2 alkoxyethanol class. The cellosolves are.generally, a little less soluble in water than the carbitols. but they can be solubilized using hydrotropes.Preferred for use herein are Butyl Carbitol, Trade Mark for 2 2 butoxyethoxy ethanol. and hexylcellosolve The carbitol and cellosolve solvents preferably comprise at least 0,59. generally lb 5. of the present compositions. The compositions herein also preferably contain a water soluble anionic surfactant. especially the C 10 C18 paraffin sulfonates and the C10 Cl4 alkylbenzene sulfonates. with the latter being preferred. As mentioned, nonionic surfactants may be used in modest amounts. but the levels are generally kept below 19. generally about 0.2 . Nonionics can decrease shine performance. and since they are primarily used for greasy soil removal a function which the benzylalcohol performs exceptionally well the typical ethoxylated alcohol or phenol nonionic surfactants are kept to a minimum. The compositions herein are formulated at a pH in the range 9.5 11, preferably 10.3 10.8. most preferably 10.7.Materials such as sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate. and the like, can be used to adjust pH. The compositions herein can contain various colorants.bactericides, perfumes. suds control agents such as fatty acids and soaps. and the like. Generally, usage levels of such optional ingredients are in the range of 0.02S to 1 . Apart from the benzylalcohol, the second key ingredient in the present compositions is ethylenediamine tetraacetate EDTA11 , which can be used in any of its water soluble salt forms, such as the tetrasodium preferred , trisodium, disodium, or other soluble alkali metal or ammonium salt forms, or mixtures thereof. TheEDTA appears to co act in some way with the benzylalcohol to provide good cleaning and exceptionally high shine quality in a manner not shown by other sequestrants such as citrates, nitrilotriacetates, and the like. The reason for this unique performance is not understood and is totally unexpected. The compositions herein are preferably formulated as homogeneous liquids. so a hydrotrope 1 5 is generally used to ensure homogeneity. Sodium cumene sulfonate is a preferred hydrotrope, but hydrotropes such as the toluene and xylene sulfonates may also be used, according to the desires of the formulator. Industrial Application The following is a non limiting example of a highly preferred hard surface cleaner of the type encompassed by the present invention and formulated within the range of preferred compositions of the general type i Ethylenediamine Tetraacetate 3 6 ii Benzylalcohol 2.5 6 iii Butyl Carbitol 1 5 iv Alkyl Benzene Surfactant 0.75S 2 v Hydrotrope 1 5 vi Water and Minors Balance pH product as is 10 11 EXAMPLE IIngredients Percent bv Weight C118 Alkyl Benzene Sulfonate Na 1.0Ethoxylated E07 C13 15 Alcohol 0.2Coconut Fatty Acids 0.044Sodium Carbonate 4.0EDTA as Na4 salt 4.0Benzylalcohol 3.7Butyl Carbitol 2.4Sodium Cumene Sulfonate 2.4Water NaOH to pH 10.7 Balance The composition of Example I is prepared by mixing the indicated ingredients. The resulting composition gives excellent results in both hard surface cleaning and shine.The composition may be used as is . or may by diluted in water, according to the desires of the user. The compositions herein may also be formulated to contain an abrasive. Typical abrasives include water insoluble powdered materials such as talc, calcium carbonate, pumice.melamine urea formaldehyde resin, polyethylene, methacrylate resin, polyinylchloride, and the like.Typically, abrasives have a particle size range of 10 1000 microns and are used at concentrations of 10 to 30 in the compositions. Thickeners may be added to suspend the abrasives.
