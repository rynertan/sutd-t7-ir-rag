## Description
DISC CAMERA This invention relates to improvements in a small disc camera which takes pictures by loading a disc film cartridge that accommodates a disc film, the camera being so thin as can be easily carried. A disc film is contained in a disc film cartridge which will be loaded into a disc camera.The disc film cartridge assumes the shape of a thin plate having an exposure window at the right end portion thereof as viewed from the front side. The disc film in the disc film cartridge is rotated by a predetermined angle after the shot of each frame.Fifteen frames can be shot through a photographic lens of the camera positioned just in front of the exposure window. Disc cameras which are now disclosed are as shown in Figs. l a and l b as viewed from the front side of the cameras. A photographic lens 11 is located at a central portion near the right end of the camera as viewed from the front side, and a disc film cartridge FC with exposure window is loaded at the back of the photographic lens 11.A flashlight unit 12 is located on the upper left side in the front surface of the camera, and a shutter release button 13 of the type of push button is located on the lower left side near the center of the camera. In the conventional camera of Fig. l a , furthermore, a capacitor 14 is accommodated under the flashlight unit 12, and dry cells 15 are contained in the bottom of the camera in the lengthwise direction thereof. These cameras, however, have defects with regard to their operability. Namely, since the shutter release button 13 is located on the lower left side as viewed from the front side of the camera, the photographer must hold the camera by the forefinger from the front side of the camera and by the thumb from the back side thereof i.e., the camera is not held stably. Further, the photographic lens 11 is located at the right end as viewed from the front side of the camera though it may be provided in a protruded portion. Therefore, the photographer holding the camera with the fingers of his both hands is liable to cover the photographic lens 11 with the fingers of his left hand. Also, if the photographer depresses the shutter release button 13 with his middle finger while firmly holding the camera, the flashlight unit 12 may be covered by the forefinger, resulting in lack of exposure. When the camera is vertically held, furthermore, the operability is lost and the photographic lens 11 is subject to be covered by the fingers.When the picture is to be taken by vertically holding the camera, the flashlight unit 12 must be located on the upper side. This is because, if a human face is photographed being illuminated from the lower side, it is difficult to take natural expression since the face is unnaturally illuminated.Generally, therefore, the light is emitted from the upper direction. If the conventional camera of Fig. l a is held in such a manner that the flashlight unit 12 is positioned on the upper side, the view finder 16 comes to the lowermost position and the camera is located above the photographer s eye as a whole. Therefore, the photographer finds his right hand cramped and, at the same time, the photographic lens 11 is very likely to be covered by his left hand. The object of this invention therefore is to provide a disc camera which is free from all the defects inherent in the conventional cameras, i.e., which is free from 1 The camera is apt to be held unstably when it is held only between the photographer s fingers 2 The photographic lens is likely to be covered by hand since it is located at the right end portion of the camera 3 The flashlight unit is liable to be covered by hand since the camera is not held in an ideal manner and 4 It is difficult to manipulate the camera when it is vertically held, since the view finder is located at the extreme right portion of the camera and the flashlight unit is located at the extreme left portion of the camera. Another object of this invention is to provide a disc camera in which a cartridge pocket for accommodating the disc film cartridge is located on the left side of the camera as viewed from the front of the camera so that the exposure window is allowed to be located at the right end, and the flashlight unit and the capacitor for flashing are arrayed on the right side of the cartridge pocket parallel to the pocket on a plane. That is, according to this invention, the photographic lens is located nearly at the center of the camera in contrast with the conventional disc cameras in which the photographic lens is located at the extreme right portion. Moreover, the flashlight unit is located on the right side as viewed from the front of the camera. Thus, the camera of the invention possesses advantage of the existing small cameras which feature good operability using 35 mm films, and advantage of a thin disc camera, while eliminating all of the abovementioned four defects inherent in the conventional disc cameras. Further objects and features of the present invention will become obvious from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Fig. 4 c shows an embodiment in which a flashlight unit 41c provided in a holding member 42c can be protruded slantly. When the flashlight unit 41c is retracted, the photographic lens 44c is covered by the holding member 42c. Namely, the holding member 42c also works to protect the photographic lens. With the flashlight unit 41c being retracted, furthermore, the shutter release button 45c does not work even when it is depressed.Reference numeral 43c denotes a view finder. Figs. 5 a and 5 b are front views of cameras having outer covers 51, 52 that can be split into two nearly at the central portion thereof. A flashlight unit 53 is provided in the outer cover 51 of the right side as viewed from the front of the camera, and the outer cover 51 of the right side is allowed to move between a position to cover the photographic lens 54 and a position to expose the photographic lens 54. The internal arrangement of the camera is the same as that of the embodiment of Fig. 2 or 3. Fig. 5 a shows an embodiment in which a photographic lens 54 and a view finder 55 are provided in an exposure portion that is formed when the outer cover 51 of the right side is rightwardly moved to take a picture. Fig. 5 b shows an embodiment in which a light emitting portion 56 and a light receiving portion 57 for automatic focusing are provided in the exposure portion that is formed in the same manner as in Fig. 5 a . In the embodiment shown in Fig. 5, the outer cover also works as a holding member for holding the flashlight unit. When the camera is covered by the covers, the flashlight unit does not protrude. When the outer covers are opened toward the right and left sides in order to take a picture, the flashlight unit is also protruded. Fig. 6 is a sectional view of the camera which has outer covers of Fig. 5 and internal arrangement of the camera of Fig. 2. That is, Fig. 6 is a sectional view along the line VI VI of Fig. 2. A camera body 61 contains a photographic lens 27 and a cartridge pocket 62 for accommodating the disc film cartridge FC. The body 61 further contains the capacitor 22 for flashing on the right side of the cartridge pocket 62, and the drive motor 24 of a reduced thickness above the cartridge pocket 62. The fixed outer cover of the camera is divided into a fixed front cover 52A and a back cover 52B, and the outer cover of the moving side is divided into a movable front cover 51A and a movable back cover 51B. The back cover 52B is provided with a leaf spring 63 which holds the film cartridge FC in the cartridge pocket 62 in position. The disc film F is positioned in the opening of the film cartridge FC. On the disc film F, a picture is photographed one frame by one frame through the photographic lens 27. The movable front cover 51A and the movable back cover 51B are formed as a unitary structure, and can be drawn to a position indicated by a dot dash line to take a picture.The flashlight unit 53 is provided at a corner portion in the movable front cover 51A. According to this embodiment, the outer cover of the camera is split into two nearly at the central portion of the camera. Therefore, the lens 54, view finder 55 and light receiving window 58 for automatic exposure can be arrayed in a concentrated manner in a portion that is exposed when the cover 51 is opened. These members are concealed when the cover 51 is closed. Therefore, the camera can be carried very conveniently,Moreover, since the flashlight unit 53 is provided in the cover 51, a so called red eye phenomenon does not occur when a picture is taken with a flashlight. Furthermore, the outer cover of the camera is divided into two nearly equally, and the cover of one side is allowed to be opened and closed with very good operability. This is the advantage obtained for the first time when the film cartridge pocket is disposed at the left end of the camera.Effects of the Invention In the foregoing was described the disc camera according to this invention which has a reduced depth and which features excellent operability.The camera according to this invention is free from all of the defects inherent in the conventional disc cameras. The camera of the invention further has advantage over the existing disc cameras with regard to electric circuits. That is, in a conventional disc camera, a flashing voltage booster circuit which produces a voltage of as high as several hundred volts is located close to an integration circuit for controlling the operation of camera in which a current of as small as several microamperes to several milliamperes flows. Or these circuits are often formed on the same substrate. Accordingly, the circuit of small currents is subject to be affected by electric noise produced by intense electric discharge accompanying the emission of flashlight or by the charge of electricity. The results in the occurrence of trouble or erroneous operation, and presents disadvantage with regard to reliability. To guarantee the trouble requires a tremendous amount of cost. According to this invention, on the other hand, the problem resulting from the electric noise is solved, since the flashlight unit and the capacitor for flashing are located at the extreme right portions as viewed from the front of the camera, remote from a small current circuit which controls the operation of camera.
