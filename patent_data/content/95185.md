# A helically shaped intake port of an internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
An engine comprising an intake port which has a separating wall projecting downwardly from the upper wall of the intake port. The separating wall defines a helical portion, an inlet passage portion tangentially connected to the helical portion, and a bypass passage interconnecting the inlet passage portion and the helical portion. The separating wall has an upstream end portion centrally located between the opposed side walls of the intake port. A rotary valve is arranged in the bypass passage and is actuated by a vacuum operated diaphragm apparatus. The rotary valve is opened when the amount of air fed into the cylinder of the engine is increased beyond a predetermined value.
