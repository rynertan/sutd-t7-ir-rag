# Card processor with fail safe card return upon power failure.

## Abstract
This card processor includes an electrical driving means for operating either in a take in mode for conveying a card upon insertion thereof to a determinate position, or in an ejection mode for expelling a taken in card to the outside, and a control means for controlling supply of electrical energy to the electrical driving means so as to cause it to operate either in the take in mode or in the ejection mode. A non volatile memory means is for being set upon insertion of the card and for being reset upon expelling of the card. A first switch switches over supply of electrical power to the electrical driving means from the control means to a battery upon failure of normal power supply a second switch supplies electrical power from the battery to the electrical driving means, upon detection of failure of normal power supply when the non volatile memory means is in the set state, in such a manner as to operate the electrical driving means to operate in its ejection mode and a timer termin ates the supply by the second switch of electrical power from the battery to the electrical driving means, after the supply has been performed for a determinate time interval. Thereby in the event of failure of normal power supply the card is guaranteed to be ejected from the card processor and is not retained in its inside, and accordingly does not become unavailable to the user.
