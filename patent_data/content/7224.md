# Heat wave reflective or electrically conductive laminated structure.

## Abstract
There is described a heat wave reflective or electrically conductive laminated structure composed of A a shaped solid substrate, B a transparent thin layer having a high refractive index in contact with said substrate A , C a transparent heat wave reflective layer of an electri cally conductive metal in contact with said layer B , and D optionally, a tranparent thin layer having a high refrac tive index D in contact with said layer C and a transparent top layer D in contact with said trans parent thin layer D in which the layer C is a layer composed of Ag and Au in which the amount of Au is 3 to 30 by weight based on the total weight of Ag and Au.
