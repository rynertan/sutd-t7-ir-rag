# A METHOD FOR THE SEPARATION OF CARBON ISOTOPES BY CHEMICAL EXCHANGE METHOD.

## Abstract
A process for separating carbon isotopes, which com prises contacting an aqueous solution containing acid dis sociation type and non dissociation type chemical species of carbon containing acids with a solid phase anion exchange resin to thereby simultaneously conduct a carbon isotope exchange reaction between said acid dissociation type chemical species and non dissociation type chemical species and adsorb said acid dissociation type chemical species on said anion exchange resin, thus C¹² and C¹³ being separated into the solution phase and the solid phase, respectively, or vice versa, for the concentration of C¹³. This process is extremely effective and can be conducted inexpensively as compared with conventional separating processes by che mical exchange between gas and liquid phases, between gas and solution phases, or between solution and solution phases.
