# SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING STEEL IN A TOP BLOWN VESSEL

## Abstract
A system and method is provided for refining molten metal in a top blown vessel 10 , particularly, by removal of the carbon content. The system includes means 18,20 for selecting refining gases to be top blown, means 22 for regulating the composition of the top blown gases, and means 24 for controlling the rate of flow of the top blown gases. The system further includes means 16 for introduc ing an inert gas from beneath the molten bath surface during top blowing, means 26 for regulating the composition of the inert gas, and means 28,30 for controlling the rate of flow of the inert gas as a function of the top blown gas composition and flow rate. A method for introducing the gases using said system is also provided.
