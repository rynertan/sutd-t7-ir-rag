# Pressure casting process and machine for carrying out the process.

## Abstract
A modified die casting process and machine utilizes a shaped and contained charge of molten metal which is formed and moved proximate the gate runner while the die halves are open. The charge is formed between the shot piston and an ejector side plunger which includes a slave driver rod projecting to engage the shot piston. By confin ing and compacting the charge, a charge more homo geneous and of uniform temperature is provided. When the die halves close, the shot piston further advances moving the plunger against a stop, retracting the slave driver rod and filling the cavity at the desired flow rate. The cavity is provided with one or more impact absorbing devices posi tioned in recesses on the parting plane of the die. Each device comprises concentric plungers driven outwardly, first to detect flow and stop the shot piston to avoid peak impact pressure, with the internal plunger then being ex tended independently to apply compacting pressure to the still molten core of the recess minimizing the volume of any gas trapped in the metal and to feed solidification shrinkage. Accordingly, a more time and energy efficient and less expensive machine and process is provided to obtain high quality die castings.
