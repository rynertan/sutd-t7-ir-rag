# Method and apparatus for spectral transmissibility examination and analysis.

## Abstract
Apparatus for the physiological examination of tissue, particularly the human female breast, comprises a test in strument 10 having a first component 24 providing a light source, for example the termination of an optical fibre bun dle 44 , and a second component 26 having a light detector 58, 60, 62, 64 , the two components being carried by support means 27, 28, 29 for movement towards and away from one another with means for measuring the light path length between the source and detector. The first component also carries a light detector 48 close to the light source. The apparatus is adjusted so that the two components engage opposite surfaces of the breast and bursts of light of select ed wavelengths are delivered by the light source and the light transmitted through the breast is detected and signals passed to analysing apparatus 22 . The apparatus may be used to produce comparisons between different readings, for example between readings from the two breasts of one woman, between readings from the same breast at sepa rated time intervals and between readings from different women.
