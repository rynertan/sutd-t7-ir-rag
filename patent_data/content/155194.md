## Description
The present invention relates to amorphous thermoplastic resin compositions having improved moldability. Amorphous thermoplastic resins are characterized by the fact that they can be molded by heating them to a temperature above the glass transition temperature, thereby reducing their viscosity. It is largely due to their good moldability that these amorphous thermoplastic resins have gained greater and wider usage as compared to thermosetting resins. In recent years, however, better moldability has been required of thermoplastic resins, and the improvement of their moldability has been an important problem in the art. In particular, ABS resins, polycarbonates, polyacrylates polysulfones and polyether sulfones have come into widespread use as materials for replacing metals because of their high strength and heat resistance and, as engineering plastics, their use have been extended to include component parts for machines, automobiles and electrical and electronic equipment. These engineering plastics have high strength and heat resistance, but due to their high melting temperatures and melt viscosities, they frequently require to be molded at high molding temperatures and pressures. Hence, there has been a strong demand for the improvement of their moldability. General purpose plastics are also required to have good flowability because articles of large size, small thickness or a complex shape are required to be molded. When amorphous resins are heated above their glass transition temperature, there is no abrupt decrease of viscosity such as occurs in crystalline resins and their molding is frequently difficult as compared with the crystalline resins. Methods for decreasing the intermolecular cohesive force of polymers have been generally used to improve the moldability of such amorphous thermoplastic resins. For example, the following techniques have been used These techniques entail various problems which are still to be solved and which constitute great technical problems in the art. For example, according to techniques 1 and 2 , a modification such as copolymerization frequently results in a deterioration in the inherent properties such as heat resistance of the resin to be modified. According to techniques 3 and 4 , the mechanical strength of the polymer is reduced in many cases. In technique 5 , the heat resistance of the polymer is sacrificed. The present inventors have extensively investigated additives which can improve the moldability of amorphous thermoplastic resins, while inhibiting a reduction in mechanical strength or heat resistance, and have come to believe that such additives desirably have the following properties Such additives are required to cause phase separation from the matrix, but on the other hand, in order to prevent the reduction of mechanical strength, such additives must have an interfacial adhesion strength between the additives and the matrix which has been phase separated. Therefore, the additives also need to be a compound having an affinity for the matrix. The present inventors have continued their investigations in order to define more specifically compounds satisfying the desiderata 1 and 2 , and judged that compounds meeting the following requirements a , b and c are suitable Extensive investigations based on this analysis led to the discovery that specific diamide compounds act effectively on polyphenylene ether resins. An invention based on this discovery was the subject of JP A 233289 82 and EP A 115218. An object of the present invention is to improve the moldability of other thermoplastic resins. To this end the present inventors have continued their investigations and have found that the addition of the above described diamide compounds to various thermoplastic resins produces results similar to those obtained previously with regard to the polyphenylene ether resin. This discovery has led to the present invention. According to the present invention there is provided a thermoplastic resin composition comprising a diamide compound as a moldability improver, characterised in that the composition comprises 100 parts by weight of amorphous thermoplastic resin, other than a resin containing polyphenylene ether, and selected from styrene resins, vinyl chloride resins, polycarbonate resins, polyarylate resins, polysulfone resins, polyether sulfones and blends thereof and 0.01 to 25 parts by weight of a diamide compound of the following formula I wherein R¹ represents a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon residue having 1 to 10 carbon atoms or an aromatic hydrocarbon residue having 6 to 10 carbon atoms and R² and R³ which may be the same or different each represents a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon residue having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, a saturated or unsaturated alicyclic hydrocarbon residue having 3 to 10 carbon atoms or an aromatic hydrocarbon residue having 6 to 10 carbon atoms. The amorphous thermoplastic resin is selected, for example, from styrene resins such as polystyrene, high impact polystyrene, AS resin and ABS resin , vinyl chloride resins, acrylic resins, polycarbonate resins, polynorbornene resins, polyarylate resins, polysulfone resins and polyether sulfone resins. Accordingly various amorphous thermoplastic resins may be used in the present invention.

In the present invention there may also be used blends polymer alloys of these thermoplastic resins with each other, for example, an alloy of polycarbonate and polystyrene, an alloy of ABS resin and vinyl chloride polymer or an alloy of polycarbonate and a vinyl chloride polymer. Homo or co polymers of styrene, α methylstyrene or halogenated styrene, or copolymers of such a styrene monomer and a vinyl monomer copolymerizable therewith may be used as the polystyrene type resins. Modified polystyrene resins obtained by grafting such a styrene monomer onto a polymer such as polybutadiene may also be used.

The diamide compounds which are used in the present invention dissolve in the matrix component under flow conditions during molding, and separate from a phase of the matrix component as a result of crystallization during use. Therefore, it is preferred for the diamide compounds to have a melting point slightly lower than the molding temperature. The molding temperature is generally prescribed between the temperature at which the system begins to flow the Tg of the matrix as a lower limit and the temperature at which the system begins to decompose as an upper limit, and is adjusted to a suitable point depending upon the system to be molded. Accordingly, the desirable melting point of the diamide compound in accordance with the present invention which is set at a temperature slightly lower than the molding temperature is selected according to the molding temperature for the intended thermoplastic resins. Generally, it is between 100 and 400 C. The amount of the diamide compound added is 0.01 to 25 parts by weight, preferably 0.1 to 20 parts by weight, more preferably 0.5 to 10 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the thermoplastic resin. Various additives may be used with the amorphous thermoplastic resins according to their intended use. For example, reinforcing agents e.g., glass fibers and inorganic fillers stabilizers, plasticizers, fire retardants, mold releasing agents and coloring agents may be used. The effect of improving moldability by the addition of the diamide compound in accordance with this invention is produced not only with the thermoplastic resin alone, but also with a mixture of the resin with the above described various additives. The amorphous thermoplstic resin, the diamide compound and the additives may be melt kneaded by a conventional method, for example, by using a Banbury mixer, a kneader or an extruder.
