# AUXILIARY COOLING SYSTEM WITH BLOWN AIR FOR COILS OF HOT ROLLED METALLIC WIRE, AND DEVICE TO CARRY OUT SAID SYSTEM

## Abstract
Cooling system with blown air for coils of hot rolled metallic wire 11 borne on a cooling roller conveyor 12 , said system being characterized by directing an additional stream of air towards the zones of greatest accumulation of the material near the edges of said roller conveyor 12 , whereby said blowing of air is coordinated with the main blowing of cooling air from under said roller conveyor 12 and can be regulated as regards its strength and its orientation towards the zones of interest, and whereby the relative means to carry out said system consist of at least one tubular conduit means 18 disposed lengthwise along said cooling roller conveyor 12 and connected to means delivering compressed air 20 , a plurality of blower means 19 25 , and anchorage means 21 for the conduit means 18 , whereby said anchorage means 21 enable the orienta tion of the stream of air towards the coils in the zones of interest to be regulated.
