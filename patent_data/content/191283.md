## Description
The present invention relates to novel thermoplastic elastomeric molding compositions capable of withstanding high temperatures and able to absorb high energy and spring back with little or no permanent deformation upon impact. Specifically, the compositions of the instant invention comprise polyetherimide esters or polyetherester imides having admixed therewith a combination of an aromatic polyester, most preferably poly butylene terephthalate , and a mineral filler selected from the group consisting of clay and syenite. Polyether ester imides are well known having been described in numerous publications and patents including for example, Honore et al, Synthesis and Study of Various Reactive Oligmers and of Poly ester imide ether s , Poly ether ester imides have very poor heat sag resistance. Thus, molded parts from these compositions severely sag upon exposure to high temperatures, eg. greater than 121 C 250 F . Additionally, because of the high flexibility of these materials as demonstrated by their very low flexural modulus, these compositions are limited to certain applications where physical integrity or stiffness of the part is not desired. In accordance with the present invention there are provided novel thermoplastic compositions as defined in claim 1. The compositions of the present invention comprise from 1 to 98 percent by weight, preferably from 10 to 90 percent by weight, of elastomer a and from 2 to 99 percent by weight, preferably from 10 to 90 percent by weight of the combination b wherein the polyester component b ii comprises from 1 to 98 percent by weight, preferably from 5 to 90 percent by weight, based on the total weight of a b and the mineral filler comprises from 1 to 60 percent by weight, preferably 5 to 40 percent by weight, based on the total weight of a b .

Preferred dicarboxylic acids for the preparation of the polyetherimide esters are the aromatic dicarboxylic acids, mixtures thereof and mixtures of one or more dicarboxylic acid with an aliphatic and or cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acid, most preferably the aromatic dicarboxylic acids. Among the aromatic acids, those with 8 16 carbon atoms are preferred, particularly the benzene dicarboxylic acids, i.e., phthalic, terephthalic and isophthalic acids and their dimethyl derivatives. Especially preferred is dimethyl terephthalate. Finally, where mixtures of dicarboxylic acids are employed in the preparation of the poly etherimide ester , it is preferred that at least about 60 mole , preferably at least about 80 mole , based on 100 mole of dicarboxylic acid ii be of the same dicarboxylic acid or ester derivative thereof.

Polyoxyalkylene diimide diacids iii are high molecular weight diimide diacids wherein the average molecular weight is greater than about 700, most preferably greater than about 900. They may be prepared by the imidization reaction of one or more tricarboxylic acid compounds containing two vicinal carboxyl groups or an anhydride group and an additional carboxyl group, which must be esterifiable and preferably is nonimidizable, with a high molecular weight polyoxylalkylene diamine. These polyoxyalkylene diimide diacids and processes for their preparation are more fully disclosed in EP A 85 113 523. In general, the polyoxyalkylene diimide diacids have the following formula wherein each R is independently a trivalent organic radical, preferably a C₂ to C₂₀ aliphatic, aromatic or cycloaliphatic trivalent organic radical each R is independently hydrogen or a monovalent organic radical preferably selected from the group consisting of C₁ to C₆ aliphatic and cycloaliphatic radicals and C₆ to C₁₂ aromatic radicals, e.g. benzyl, most preferably hydrogen and G is the radical remaining after removal of the terminal amino groups of a long chain poly oxyalkylene diamine equivalent to the long chain poly oxyalkylene glycols as described above in formulas I and III above.

In the preparation of the poly etherimide ester s, the diimide diacid may be preformed in a separate step prior to polymerization or they may be formed during polymerization itself. In the latter instance, the polyoxyalkylene diamine and tricarboxylic acid component may be directly added to the reactor together with the diol and dicarboxylic acid, whereupon imidization occurs concurrently with esterification. Alternatively, the polyoxyalkylene diimide diacids may be preformed prior to polymerization by known imidization reactions including melt synthesis or by synthesizing in a solvent system. Such reactions will generally occur at temperatures of from 100 C. to 300 C., preferably at from about 150 C. to about 250 C. while drawing off water or in a solvent system at the reflux temperature of the solvent or azeotropic solvent mixture. Preferred polyetherimide esters are those in which the weight ratio of the polyoxyalkylene diimide diacid iii to dicarboxylic acid ii is from 0.25 to 2, preferably from 0.4 to 1.4.

As mentioned, the polyetherimide esters may be prepared by conventional esterification condensation reactions for the production of polyesters. Exemplary of the processes that may be practiced are as set forth in, for example, U.S. A 3,023,192 3,763,109 3,651,014 3,663,653 and 3,801,547. The polyesters will have repeating units of the following general formula where D is as defined above in formulas II and IV for aliphatic and cycloaliphatic diols. Additionally, these polyesters may also contain minor amounts of other units such as aliphatic dicarboxylic acids and or aliphatic polyols. Preferred polyesters include poly butylene terephthalate , poly ethylene terephthalate and blends thereof, most preferably poly butylene terepthalate . The polyesters described above are either comercially available or can be produced by methods well known in the art, such as those set forth in US A 2,465,319 3,047,539 and 2,910,466. The syenites are inorganic feldspathic minerals which are widely known and commercially available. A preferred syenite is the nepheline syenite which is an anhydrous sodium potassium aluminum silicate. One particular source for such minerals fillers is Indusmin Ltd. under the tradename MINEX. The preferred class of mineral fillers are the clays. Clay minerals are well known and widely available commercially. Preferred clays are the crystalline and paracrystalline clays. Especially preferred are the crystalline clays, most preferably the Kaolin clays. The clays, particularly the Kaolin clays, may be in the hydrous form or in the calcined, anhydrous form. Exemplary of commerically available, suitable clays there may be given the clays available under the tradenames Whitex and Translink from Freeport Kaolin. Additionally, it is preferred, although not required, to utilize such mineral fillers which have been treated with a titanate or silane coupling agent. Exemplary of such coupling agents there may be given vinyl tris 2 methoxy ethoxy silane and gamma aminopropyl triethyoxy silane A 1100, Union Carbide . Additionally, the compositions of the present invention may be suitably admixed with other additives including for example antioxidants elasticizers, pigments, flame retardants, and the like as necessary. The compositions of the present invention may be prepared by any of the well known techniques for preparing polymer blends or admixtures, with extrusion blending being preferred. Suitable devices for the blending include single screw extruders, twin screw extruders, internal mixers such as the Bambury Mixer, heated rubber mills electric or oil heat or Farrell continuous mixers. Injection molding equipment can also be used to accomplish blending just prior to molding, but care must be taken to provide sufficient time and aggitation to insure uniform blending prior to molding. Alternative methods include dry blending prior to extrusion or injection molding as well as precompounding of two ingredients, particularly the thermoplastic polyester b ii and mineral filler b i prior to mixing with the thermoplastic elastomer a . The polymer compositions prepared in accordance with the present invention are suitable for a broad range of molding applications. The preferred compositions have excellent heat sag resistance so as to allow for their use in painted articles which must be baked in ovens. Additionally, these compositions have excellent Dynatup properties such that when struck, they give to the impinging energy and spring back after the energy is removed. Thus, these compositions are especially suitable for use in automotive applications, as for example, in fenders or bumpers. The following examples are given as exemplary of the present invention. The following ASTM methods were used in determining the physical characteristics of the compositions All compositions were prepared by melt blending the thermoplastic elastomer with the thermoplastic aromatic polyester and kaolin clay in a Prodex single screw extruder. PEIE A D are polyether imide esters prepared from butanediol, dimethylterephthalate, poly propylene ether diamine ave MW 2000 and trimellitic anhydride, wherein the weight ratio of dimethylterephthalate to diimide diacid was such as to produce polymers of flexural modulus as follows PEIE E is a polyetherimide ester prepared from butanediol, dimethylterephthalate and copoly propylene ether ethylene ether diamine ave MW 900 and trimellitic anhydride, wherein the weight ratio of dimethylterephthalate to diimide diacid was such as to provide a polymer of 105N mm² 15,000 psi . PEEI is a polyetherester imide prepared in accordance with US A 4,371,692 and 4,371,693 above, from 32.5 parts by weight trimellitic anhydride, 13 parts by weight glycine, 23 parts by weight poly tetramethylene ether glycol ave MW 1000 , 31 parts by weight butanediol and 0.5 parts by weight stabilizer with a titanate ester catalyst. Compositions within the scope of the present invention were prepared demonstrating blends of polyether ester imide with modifying amounts of poly butylene terephthalate and kaolin clay across a broad range of weight ratios. The specific makeup and physical properties of these compositions were as presented in Table 1. From Table 1 it is apparent that while all compositions have good impact strength, best impact strength is obtained where at least about 30 weight percent of the elastomer is present. Similarly with high loadings of elastomer, moderate levels of polyester and low levels of clay, the compositions have excellent Dynatup properties which enable parts molded therefrom to absorb high energy on impact, without rupture and to spring back to its original shape with little, if any, deformation. Examples with low loadings of elastomer and clay and high loadings of polyester as well as low loadings of elastomer and moderate loadings of both polyester and clay had superior heat sag resistance. Most preferred of these compositions are examples 1 6 which have a most desirable combination of Dynatup properties, heat sag resistance and impact strength. An additional series of compositions were prepared to further demonstrate the breadth of the present invention. The specific makeup and physical properties of these compositions were as presented in Table 2. Examples 14 and 15 demonstrate the affect the melt viscosity of the virgin elastomer has on the compositions of the present invention. As is evident, little effect is seen in most elastomeric properties however, with the lower melt viscosity elastomer, elongation suffers quite noticeably. Examples 16 through 19 demonstrate the impact the flexural modulus of the virgin polyetherimide ester elastomer has on the properties. Specifically, comparison of examples 16 and 17 with 18 and 19, respctively shows that some loss of impact strength occurs but is offset by a marked increase in heat sag resistance with the higher flex modulus elastomers. It is also important to note that at low loadings of a high flexural modulus elastomer the superior dynatup properties of the preferred compositions of the present invention are adversely affected. Finally, examples 20 and 21 demonstrate the present invention utilizing elastomers derived from poly propylene ether diamine and copoly propylene ether ethylene ether diamine respectively. As is evident, the former composition excels with respect to impact strength and Dynatup properties whereas the latter composition has markedly superior tensile elongation and heat sag resistance.
