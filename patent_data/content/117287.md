## Description
This invention relates to a method for correcting errors in digital data, for example, for correcting multibyte errors in blocks of data read from a disk file. Various methods are known for correcting errors in digital data, as described in the following references It has long been recognized by the art that the data stored on a magnetic medium, such as a disk file, will be subject to errors during the read back process for a number of valid technical reasons. Present day disk files include a number of different approaches to minimizing the number of errors that may occur during the read back process. For example, most disks undergo a thorough surface analysis test to identify defective areas before the disk is incorporated into the drive. Those disks having errors above a certain predetermined criteria are rejected, which does have an adverse affect on the manufacturing cost of the disk drive. In addition, systems are provided in many disk drives which, based on defect data stored on a disk, cause the drive to avoid a bad track, a bad sector, or a defective area of a disk track. These later systems involve skipping bad areas during the storage of data on the track. Other systems are included in the file which operate to reread the data when an error is detected. The rereading operation occurs under slightly different conditions each time, such as offsetting the transducer from the center of the track or increasing the gain of the read amplifier until, hopefully, the error is corrected during the rereading process. The addition of such error recovery systems is motivated primarily by the realization that it is important to minimize the number of errors that have to be corrected by associated error correcting circuitry since use of the ECC system may adversely impact overall system performance. In addition, usable storage capacity is decreased since considerably more redundancy is required if more errors must be corrected. Systems which correct only single errors are used exclusively in current disk files. A single error, by definition, may include a burst type error involving a group of contingent bit positions. However, two separate burst errors or even widely spaced single bit errors cannot be corrected by these single error correcting systems. Consideration must, therefore, be given to the length of the data block that will correspond to the codeword in order to minimize or prevent the occurrence of more than one error in that data block. That consideration is generally based on statistical data in terms of the number of errors that can be expected on a probability basis. While prior art systems and methods for correcting single errors operate successfully, it is recognized that their use does impact system performance so that considerable effort and expense are taken in the design of disk files to minimize their use, as explained above. The art has further recognized that all the different error patterns which occur in one byte of a multibyte codeword are correctable using a reasonable amount of redundancy. It has also been recognized that by interleaving codewords, a burst which extends longer than one byte may be corrected, provided the length of the burst is less than m bytes. It is also known that a multibyte, i.e., more than one, error correcting system may be provided in accordance with the teaching of US Patent US A 4 494 234, which was not published before the priority date of this application, entitled On the Fly Multibyte Error Correcting System , and assigned to the assignee of the present invention. One of the main reasons why multibyte error correcting systems have not been readily adopted for disk files is the constraint imposed by those codes on the block size or codeword. It is recognized that the codeword is limited to 2 It can be seen that in such arrangements the redundancy becomes quite high and the overall capacity of the disk file is severely restricted. Besides adversely affecting useful storage capacity, the relatively small block size also imposes many undesirable constraints in the design of the data format that is used on the track. In future disk files, it is desirable to provide better reliability and availability in spite of higher data storage density and data rates. In the reference 5 mentioned above, a segment which corresponds to a subblock consists of a number of interleaved codewords and a stripe which corresponds to a block consists of 20 segments and 2 bytes CRC. In decoding, first all the interleaved codewords in all segments are decoded and then the CRC is used for an overall check for the data integrity of a stripe, the CRC detecting miscorrected errors but having no error correction capability. Conventional coding techniques, such as multiple error correcting Reed Solomon or BCH codes discussed in references 1 3, while very efficient in terms of mathematical redundancy, impose algebraic constraints on the size of the codeword for a given choice of byte size. Thus, in a practical application of 8 bit bytes and with high error rates, the redundancy is often still unacceptable. These considerations present major hurdles in the application of these conventional coding techniques to future disk files. It is accordingly an object of this invention to provide a method for correcting errors which can be applied to systems such as disk files while permitting such systems to perform with fewer constraints than hitherto, thereby enabling the technical capability of the system to be better realised. In accordance with the present invention as defined in claims 1 and 6, a two level code structure is employed consisting of subblocks within a block. The structure provides two major advantages. First, constraint on the size of the codeword is removed and, second, a decoding strategy is established that permits on the fly correction of multibyte errors at the subblock level and additional reserve error correction capability at the block level. The two level coding structure of the present invention employs a data format on a disk track involving subblocks within a block. As described, each subblock includes two or more interleaved primary codewords. At the first code level, the coding structure is designed to correct t₁ symbols or errors per primary code word so that each subblock includes 2 x t₁ check bytes, i.e., two check bytes for each error in the primary codeword. The system is arranged to correct t₁ errors in each primary codeword in the on the fly manner suggested by the abovementioned US A 4 494 234. The code structure is extended to t₂ symbol correction at the block level by providing additional block level check bytes which, on reading stored data, reflect corrections inserted at the first level. The block level syndromes developed at the second level, therefore, provide an indication an all zero syndrome of whether the corrections to the primary word at the subblock level were valid or whether a miscorrection had been applied a pattern of not all zeros . The miscorrection occurs because the primary word had more than t₁ errors, e.g., t₁ x errors. The system corrects these t₁ x errors in the primary word by using the block syndromes after a modification to reflect the miscorrection, and the syndromes developed from the 2 x t₁ check bytes associated with the primary word. The block syndrome bytes and the syndromes of the primary word are sufficient to correct up to t₂ errors t₂ t₁ x in one of the subblocks. Since the t₂ symbol error s capability is shared over several subblocks and is required for only one subblock in a block, any processing at the block level may also be completed for the block in an on the fly manner. The invention and the manner in which it may be put into effect will be understood from the following more particular description of a preferred embodiment thereof, when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which FIG. 8 is a flow chart of the general decoding process. FIG. 1 illustrates the data format of a disk track that embodies the two level code structure of the present invention. It is assumed for purposes of describing a specific embodiment of the present invention that the multibyte ECC system, as shown and described, is designed to correct up to two errors in each block, an error being defined as any pattern of eight bits in one byte position of the block other than the correct pattern. It should be understood however that the invention is applicable to systems for correcting any number of errors in the block, and later on in the specification, a mathematical proof establishing the general case is provided. As shown in FIG. 1, a track 11 is formatted into a plurality of equal length blocks 12, each of which are divided into a predetermined plurality of subblocks 14. A block check byte area 15 is associated with each block which, as shown, includes four check byte positions 16. Each subblock 14, as shown, comprises two interleaved codewords 18 and 19 which are of equal length. Two pairs of check byte positions B₁ and B₀ are associated with each subblock so that a different pair of check byte positions B₁ and B₀ are associated with each subblock codeword 18 or 19. The details of the two level code will be discussed in connection with the following main design parameters where. The parameters b, m, n and g determine many of the important capabilities of the code. For example, one symbol correction at the subblock level with g interleaved words protects against a burst error signal of a length up to bg b 1 . Two symbol correction at the block level with g interleaved words at the subblock level protects against two different burst errors, each of which may be bg b 1 bits in length or one long burst up to 2bg b 1 bits. The above identified parameters of the ECC code allow the capabilities of the code to be adjusted to match the actual measured error conditions of a product without a change in the ECC system hardware even though the actual conditions, as measured, are substantially different from those conditions for which the system was initially designed. The word length parameter m in bytes and the number n of subblocks in a block determine the capability of the code. The word length must satisfy the following equation The block length in bytes is equal to the number g of interleaved words times the number of bytes in each word times the number of subblocks n in the block. In the system shown in FIG. 1, it is assumed a word comprises 64 data byte positions m and two check byte positions B₁ and B₀ and a subblock has two g interleaved words. A block, therefore, comprises four subblocks of 128 data byte positions or 512 data byte positions and two pairs 15 and 16 of block check bytes C₁ and C₂, one pair being associated with even columns and the other pair being associated with odd columns. In general, while the two level multibyte ECC system operates at the block level, the following description is directed to processing only one of the interleaved codewords since both are processed in the same manner. The operation involves first processing the two syndrome bytes corresponding to the two check bytes associated with one word of the interleaved words of the subblock. In the specific embodiment disclosed, an error in any one byte of the word will first be corrected, regardless of the number of bit positions in a byte that are in error. Thus, any of the possible 255 error patterns in an 8 bit byte of the word will be correctable by suitably processing the two syndrome bytes provided there are no other errors in that word. The block syndromes corresponding to one of the two pairs 15 and 16 of check bytes C₁ and C₂ associated with the block are only processed when the corresponding codeword in a subblock is identified as containing more than one byte in error. Since the multibyte 2 error correction capability is shared over several relatively small subblocks and is required for only one subblock or none in a block, the error processing may be easily completed on the fly at the block level. The relationship of the block and subblock provide a unique structural advantage in the coding equations for the code of the present invention which are not available or suggested by other prior art two level coding schemes such as concatenated codes or product codes of References 6 and 7 . The preferred embodiment of the present invention as illustrated in the drawing is based on codes for symbols in Galois Fields 2⁸ or GF 2⁸ . The primary codeword consists of two check bytes designated B₀ and B₁, and m data bytes designated B₂, B₃...B In Equations 8 and 9 the represents a modulo 2 summation operation, B Equations 8 and 9 per se correspond to prior art single symbol correcting Reed Solomon or BCH codes in which the 8 bit column vectors correspond to elements of GF 2⁸ . In the notation of Equations 8 and 9, the multiplication by matrix T FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of the encoder for generating the check bytes B₀ and B₁ for each word in a subblock, while FIG. 3 illustrates the encoder in FIG. 2 in more conventional functional logic blocks. The encoder functions to perform modulo g x operations where g x is a polynomial with roots α and α². The specific generator polynomial is The details of the matrix multiplier for T³ represented by block 25 in FIGS. 2 and 3 are shown in FIG. 4a in which B represents an 8 bit input vector, selected bit positions of which are combined modulo 2 in blocks 41 through 48. The bit positions selected for inputs to blocks 41 and 48 are determined from matrix T³. As shown in FIG. 4b, the top row determines the input for block 41, while the bottom row determines the input for blocks 48, a binary 1 digit in a column signifying an input from the corresponding bit position of the input vector B. Hence, block 41 receives input from bit positions 5, 6 and 7, while block 48 receives input from bit positions 4, 5 and 6 corresponding respectively to the columns containing ones in the matrix T³. The inputs to other blocks are arranged in a similar manner. The encoder for developing check bytes C₁ and C₂ which are two of the four check bytes associated with the second level of coding is similar to the encoders for B₀ and B₁ in that C₁ and C₂ are first developed for each subblock and accumulated modulo 2 over all subblocks, as specified by the following modulo 2 matrix equations Unlike the encoder for B₀ and B₁, a separate shift register encoder, as schematically shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, is employed to develop check bytes C₁ and C₂. The encoder for C₁, as shown in FIG. 5, is equivalent functionally to a parity generator for each bit position of the input vectors. As shown in FIG. 5, block 51 represents an exclusive OR circuit, while block 52 represents one stage of a register. Blocks 61 and 62 in FIG. 6 represent similar binary logic elements, while block 63 is a matrix multiplier of the type shown in FIG. 4 and described earlier in the specification. Initially, each separate register 52, 62 for C₁ and C₂ is set to zero, and bytes B It will be recognized that if there is only one subblock, the four check bytes B₀, B₁, C₁ and C₂ corresponding to Equations 8, 9, 11 and 12 together may be considered to represent a code that is obtained in Reference 9 by extending a two symbol correcting BCH code such as that described by J. K. Wolf in an article in the Bell System Technical Journal, No. 48, pages 2408 through 2424, published in 1969 and entitled Adding Two Information Symbols to Certain Non binary BCH Codes and Some Applications . In the present embodiment, the block level codeword can be viewed as a modulo 2 super position of the four subblock codewords so that a two symbol error in this super positioned codeword is correctable in accordance with the following described logic. Assume that a block consisting of four subblocks encounters two one byte errors. If each one of the errors is in a different subblock, then these errors will be corrected by the single error correcting first level portion of the ECC system by processing the syndrome bytes corresponding to the B₁ and B₀ check bytes associated with the word in each subblock having one error. After the appropriate corrections have taken place, the syndrome bytes corresponding to C₁ and C₂ will indicate no error in the block, i.e., all zeros in these syndromes. However, assume that the two one byte errors are in one subblock. The first level system then either miscorrects the errors or indicates an uncorrectable error condition to the system which may be interpreted at that point as having more than one byte in error. If there has been a miscorrection, then the syndromes corresponding to C₁ and C₂ will not be all zeros. Next, the miscorrection is removed from the word based on the fact that the syndromes corresponding to C₁ and C₂ indicate that a miscorrection has occurred or that there are more than one error. Once the miscorrection has been removed, the two syndrome bytes corresponding to B₀ and B₁ for that word, and the modified syndrome bytes corresponding to C₁ and C₂ for that particular block are employed to correct the two bytes in error in the identified subblock in accordance with any of the known prior art arrangements for correcting multiple errors in one block employing the designated syndromes. The portion of the system which functions to correct the multibyte error in one subblock by processing the four syndrome bytes S₀ through S₃ corresponding to check bytes B₀, B₁, C₁ and C₂ may be identical to the on the fly system described in US A 4 494 234 identified in detail earlier in the specification. The specific details of the logic or the detailed steps involved in correcting the two byte error in the subblock by processing the four syndrome bytes form no part of the present invention. An understanding of one embodiment for performing that function may be obtained from reviewing that application. Other prior art arrangements for correcting two errors in a word by processing four related syndrome bytes may, of course, be employed. The present invention provides subblock and block syndrome bytes and an indication of the subblock containing the multiple one byte errors. FIG. 7, which is an overall block diagram of the present invention, shows the interrelationship of the syndrome processing block for multibyte errors with the rest of the system, as shown. As shown in FIG. 7, data from the data processing system 70 is sent to disk file 71 for storage on a track which is formatted as shown in FIG. 1. In the transfer of this data, two sets of check bytes B₁ and B₀ are developed for each subblock by the ECC encoder 72 in accordance with the previous description. Similarly, two pairs of block check bytes C₁ and C₂ are also developed by the encoder 72. The subblock formatter 72A appends the check bytes B₁ and B₀ to each corresponding subblock. Similarly, the block formatter 72B appends the block check bytes C₁ and C₂ at the end of the block. The formatted data is then recorded on the disk storage 71. In the embodiment shown, one set of the block check bytes is developed by merely accumulating the subblock check bytes B₁ and B₀ which need not be recorded at the block level. These block check bytes are associated with syndromes S₁ and S₂, while the C₁ and C₂ check bytes are associated with the S₀ and S₃ syndrome bytes and are developed during the read process by the logic circuitry previously described. It should be understood that the subscript numbers assigned to the syndromes, that is, S₀,S₁, etc., are related to the particular T matrix employed to generate the respective check characters. Specifically, S₀, which is developed from C₁, corresponds to a conventional parity check byte since each bit position of the word is checked, as shown in FIG. 4. S₃, on the other hand, is developed from C₂ which is generated in accordance with the logic shown in FIG. 5 that involves multiplying the input byte by a matrix T³. Check bytes B₁ and B₀, which are used to develop S₁ and S₂ are generated in accordance with the logic of FIGS. 1, 2 and 3 which involves matrices T¹ and T². It can be shown that the four block syndrome bytes required to correct two one byte errors in one subblock may be obtained from check bytes which are independent of the subblock check bytes B₁ and B₀. The four matrices T Referring again to FIG. 7, the block 73 represents the first level ECC function of correcting a byte error in each of the two interleaved words. A block of data is read from the file and stored in the block buffer 74 by subblocks. If syndromes S₁ and S₂ for each word of the subblock are all zeros, then no error has occurred. If all four subblocks are error free, then block 75, which generates S₀ and S₃, will also indicate an error free block and the block may be sent to the data processing system 70. Where only one one byte error has occurred in a word, that error is corrected by the first level ECC block 73 so that block 75 again confirms an error free block since the four syndrome bytes reflect corrected words and will, therefore, be all zeros. The third situation that may occur in the system shown in FIG. 7 is where the first level ECC block 73 miscorrects a byte of data in a subblock, say f, in response to processing the non zero S₁ and S₂ syndrome bytes. It will be assumed that the miscorrection occurred because the word contained two errors and not that an uncorrectable error greater than two had occurred, although block 73 will provide an uncorrectable error signal when some two error situations occur. It is further assumed that since the double error has occurred in one subblock, the other subblocks are error free. Under the assumed conditions, the fact that the word has been miscorrected will be detected by the non zero condition of either or both the S₀ and S₃ block syndrome bytes. When this occurs, the system returns subblock f to its original condition. Since the error pattern is stored in the buffer 76 along with subblock data, subblock f is read out with the error pattern through the correction logic 78, modified, and returned to the buffer. Also, the original four syndrome bytes are modified by block 77 to reflect the original two error condition. The modified set S of syndrome bytes are then processed by block 78 to decode both errors in subblock f which are also sent to the correction logic 78 during the modification of subblock f. The block of data is then transferred to the data processing system 70 with no errors. The last error condition that may occur in the system is where one subblock contains more than two errors and, hence, is uncorrectable. This error condition is beyond the capability of the code, hence, it may get miscorrected. Sometimes this will be indicated by the second level decoder 78 when, as a result of processing a modified set S of syndrome bytes, an uncorrectable error signal is provided since the syndrome processing circuitry of block 78 was unable to identify the location and or error pattern of one or both errors. FIG. 8 is a flow chart which summarizes the operations just described and sets forth the sequence of steps involved in the method of the present invention. While the preferred embodiment, as shown and described, assumed the two level code structure in which a one byte error in a codeword was correctable at the first level and a two byte error was correctable at the block level, it should be understood that the method and system may be modified to handle t₁ errors at the first codeword level and t₂ errors at the block level where t₁ is greater than one and t₂ t₁. It should be recognized in connection with the system just described that in order for the correcting process to work at the second level to correct two errors in the subblock, it is necessary to identify which subblock contained two one byte errors. In the system described, a subblock is identified by the non zero subblock syndromes which, when processed by the first level syndrome processing circuits, indicates either an uncorrectable error or provides a one byte correction which, in effect, is a miscorrection that is subsequently detected by the non zero condition of the block syndromes. If any other subblock provides non zero syndromes, which causes the first level syndrome processing circuits to perform a correction, it is then not possible to correct the block since the number of errors in the block and their distribution necessarily exceeds the correcting capacity of the system. Thus, in the illustrated embodiment, where the block comprises four subblocks, each with two interleaved codewords, the system could correct up to eight one byte errors, provided that each error was in a different codeword. However, if one or more codewords in one subblock contain two one byte errors, then, for the system to correct these errors, all codewords in other subblocks in the block must be error free. In general, t₁ is the number of errors correctable at the subblock level and t₂ is the number of errors correctable at the block level. It is shown later in the specification that the combined capabilities of the two level code architecture can provide correction of various combinations of multi symbol errors distributed over many subblocks. This is stated in the following theorem. The combined capability of the two level system provides correction of any combination of t₁ x errors in any one subblock, any combination of up to t₁ x errors in each of the other subblocks, and y errors in the block level check bytes. In this theorem, x and y are unspecified integers such that 0 αµρ x αµρ x y αµρ t₂ t₁ . The subblock level code has a minimum Hamming distance d₁ 2t₁ 1 , while the block level code has a minimum distance d₂ 2t₂ 1 . The general decoding process set forth in FIG. 8 is followed except that an identification of the subblock containing an error is stored, along with the number of errors and error patterns for up to the maximum number of errors t₁ whenever a subblock error is detected. The key step in the decoding process is the ability to identify the subblock in the word which should be processed by the second level syndrome processing circuits using the block syndrome bytes in cases where more than one subblock contains an error that was corrected. The following proof establishes that the subblock having the highest number of bytes corrected at the first level is the subblock which should be corrected using the block syndromes. For example, assume the first level can correct up to two errors for each codeword, and the block can correct up to four errors. If three errors occur in one subblock A and one error in subblock D, then the first level system in processing syndromes for subblock A would indicate either an uncorrectable error or proceed to modify two bytes in that subword in what appears as a normal correction but, in effect, is a miscorrection which adds two additional errors to the subblock. In processing subblock D, one error would be indicated and that one error would be corrected during syndrome processing by the first level circuits. The block syndromes, however, would indicate the possibility of a miscorrection in that a non zero condition would be indicated. Since two subblocks were corrected, either subblock might be the one containing more errors than the first level system could handle. The theorem establishes that the subblock which is to be corrected at the block level is the subblock which received the most number of bytes corrected at the first level which, in the example, was block A. The original three errors in block A will then be corrected by the process of FIG. 8. The proof of this theorem follows. Assume that one subblock i f contains t₁ x errors, each of the other subblocks i f contains up to t₁ x errors. The integers x, y and f are not known and 0 αµρ x αµρ x y αµρ t₂ t₁ . When x 0, all errors at the subblock level are corrected properly since they are all within the capability of the subblock code. When x 0, consider the subblock f with t₁ x errors. Since the minimum Hamming distance d₁ is 2t₁ 1 , the nearest codeword must differ from the received word in at least 2t₁ 1 t₁ x positions. Thus, the decoder may miscorrect the subblock f by introducing additional errors in at least t₁ x 1 positions and as many as t₁ positions to go to the nearest codeword. Or the decoder may find subblock f uncorrectable if its Hamming distance from the nearest codeword is greater than t₁. In contrast, the decoder will correct t₁ x or fewer positions in each of the other subblocks, all of which will be corrected properly. At the block level, the syndrome set S is computed from received data which include all subblock level error corrections. The set S is, then, the block level syndrome set for all errors still present in the block, that is in subblock f and the block level check bytes. These are, at the most, t₂ t₁ errors which include t₁ x y original errors and up to t₁ miscorrections. Since the minimum Hamming distance d₂ 2t₂ 1 exceeds t₂ t₁ , the corresponding syndromes S must be non zero. Thus, the uncorrected or miscorrected errors in the block will be detected at the block level of the decoding procedure. The subblock f, with t₁ x errors is uniquely identified during processing subblock syndromes from the fact that it was declared uncorrectable or the number of corrections in subblock f exceeds those in any of the other subblocks by at least 1. If all subblocks were corrected properly at the subblock level, then the value of f is of no consequence at the block level. Let S The syndromes S and S Note that one burst error covers any error of length up to 9 bits. Two consecutive burst errors cover any error of length up to 25 bits. Three consecutive burst errors cover any error of length up to 41 bits. It should also be noted that while the disclosed embodiment illustrates a block of data comprising four subblocks, the general case proof shows that a block may contain only one subblock which may be one codeword having 2t₁ check bytes which permits correcting t₁ errors at the first level and 2t₂ check bytes which permits correcting up to t₂ errors at the second level. The second level system would only be operative if the syndromes corresponding to the 2t₂ block check bytes resulted in a non zero condition after the codeword had been corrected by the first level system. Depending on the error environment, it will be seen by those persons skilled in the art that each level of the system could be implemented in a different manner permitting different cost performance tradeoffs to be made reflecting error types and distributions in the block of data.
