# CONTINUOUS PROCESS FOR PURIFYING CRUDE LINEAR POLYDICHLOCONTINUOUS PROCESS FOR PURIFYING CRUDE LINEAR POLYDICHLOROPHOSPHAZENE POLYMER ROPHOSPHAZENE POLYMER

## Abstract
The oligomer content in crude polydichlorophosphazene polymer is reduced to less than about 7 by a continuous process wherein the crude polymer in solution is introduced into an extruder along with solvent selective for the oligomer whereby polymer coagulates and liquid phase rich in oligomer is formed and is prevented from exit at the polymer discharge end of the extruder by the concentration and coagulation of the polymer and is separated from the concentrated polymer upstream of the polymer discharge end by mechanical filtering.
