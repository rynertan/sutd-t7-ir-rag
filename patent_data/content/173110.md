# FIBEROPTIC LIGHT GUIDE

## Abstract
A fiberoptic light guide is described which includes a fiberoptic bundle of pure silica to provide relatively low light energy losses per unit length. To improve the light accep tance characteristics of the fiberoptic bundle, a relatively short second fiberoptic bundle having excellent light recep tion characteristics due to a high numerical aperture is coupled to the first fiberoptic bundle by means of a higher efficiency fiberoptic coupling. The fiberoptic light guide, by possessing excellent light reception characteristics, as well as relatively low light energy losses per unit length, may be efficiently used with commercially available light sources such as incandescent lamps in a variety of medical and industrial applications for the visual inspection of remote, relatively inaccessible areas.
