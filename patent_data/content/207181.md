## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION SAFETY GLASS WITH DUAL HEAT REFLECTING LAYERSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention generally relates to transparent sheet units having a heat reflecting capability for use in buildings, more particularly to a safety glass sheet unit with dual heat reflecting layers.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART In order to reduce the transmission of solar heat into buildings during the hot summer, many modern buildings use glass sheet units having a solar heat reflecting capabi lity for their windows or curtain walls. A primary type of the glass sheet unit of the kind consists of an ordinary clear sheet having a thin, transparent heat reflecting film or coating on one of its two surfaces. The heat reflecting film or coating may be a layer of transparent metal or metallic oxide deposited on the glass sheet surface through various processes, and is disposed at the outboard side of the glass sheet so that incident solar rays, or light, are partially reflected. However, as the heat reflecting film is exposed to the atmosphere, its heat reflecting apability tends to deteriorate after prolonged use.Furthermore, the exposed heat reflecting film is vulnerable to assult by foreign articles such as dust, and is also subject to easy scratching when wiped with a cloth.Moreover, a single layered glass sheet unit may shatter in an accident, thus posing a potential danger to the occupants of the building. An improved glass sheet unit of the kind consists of two glass sheets bonded by a transparent layer of bonding material to become a laminated structure, wherein one of the two glass sheets is provided with a heat reflecting layer, normally on the inner surface that abuts another glass sheet thus the heat reflecting layer is isolated from the atmosphere and therefore will neither deteriorate, fade, nor be subject to scratching, and the layer of bonding material will act to prevent shattering, as in ordinary safety glass, when the glass sheet unit is broken.In use, a glass sheet unit having a heat reflecting layer on its inner surface is disposed at the outboard side of the laminate, and incident solar rays, or light from the outside of the building, are refracted first when passing through the outer glass sheet of the glass sheet unit and then reflected by the heat reflecting layer, so that the glass sheet unit becomes a mirrorlike wall when viewed from the outside of the building.However, as the heat reflecting layer also reflects light transmitted from sources within the building, and the light is refracted twice when passing through the inner glass sheet of the glass sheet unit and the layer of bonding material before being reflected by the heat reflecting layer, a duplicated virtual image in addition to an ordinary virtual image will be seen when one within the building looks at the glass sheet unit. This is because the density of the glass material differs from that of the bonding material and the light that has been refracted once when it enters the inner glass sheet is refracted again when it enters the transparent layer of the bonding material. This phenomenon is particularly significant for a glass sheet unit whose layer of bonding material is thickened substantially for a greater capability of preventing shattering.Such a duplicated virtual image, sometimes regarded as a ghost image , often causes the occupants of the building to feel unpleasant and uncomfortable.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore the main object of the present invention to provide a safety glass having the capability of reflecting solar heat without producing a duplicated virtual image. The safety glass according to the present invention is composed of a laminate of two transparent glass sheets, each having a layer of heat reflecting coating or film, or a heat reflecting layer the two glass sheets being bonded together with a transparent layer of bonding material, to provide dual heat reflecting layers in a glass sheet unit of laminated structure. In a preferred embodiment, the two glass sheets are so bonded that the surfaces having the heat reflecting layers are bonded together in other words, the two heat reflecting layers are disposed to face each other with the layer of bonding material interposed between the two heat reflecting layers. The heat reflecting layer may be a thin film of transparent metal or metallic oxide, whose heat reflecting capability may vary, depending upon the application. With this arrangement the glass sheet unit will not produce a duplicated virtual image when one looks at it from either side as light will not be refracted twice before being reflected by either one of the two heat reflecting layers. The transparent layer of bonding material may preferably be colorless i.e., clear , or tinted for certain applications.Its thickness may vary up to as thick as 50 mm if excessive strength against shattering or a sound proof capability is required. In another preferred embodiment the surface of one first glass sheet having the heat reflecting layer is bonded to the opposite surface of another second glass sheet to leave the heat reflecting layer of the second glass sheet exposed on the outer side surface. In this arrangement the glass sheet unit may be used with the second glass sheet disposed at the outboard side of the glass sheet unit when the glass sheet unit is primarily used for shielding the building from solar heat so as to keep the interior of the building relatively cool. It may also be used in a reverse arrangement when it is primarily used to keep the interior of the building relatively warm. It is another object of this invention to provide a safety glass with dual heat reflection layers which has a greater heat reflecting capabity than conventional safety glass having heat reflecting capabity, without significantly sacrificing viewing quality.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a cross sectional view of a conventional glass sheet unit having a laminated structure, with a shatter proof capability and a heat reflecting capability.Such a glass sheet unit comprises an inboard side glass sheet 1 which may be a tinted transparent glass, which is bonded to an outboard side glass sheet 5 with a transparent layer of bonding material 2, the out board side glass sheet 5 having a transparent heat reflecting layer 3 provided on its inner side. The glass sheet unit of this type produces a duplicated virtual image when viewed outwards from the inboard side of the glass sheet unit. Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view of a first embodiment of the glass sheet unit of this invention. Fig. 3 is a cross sectional view of a second embodiment of the glass sheet unit of this invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The glass sheet unit according to this invention generally comprises two glass sheets bonded together with a layer of bonding material, wherein one of the two glass sheets has a heat reflecting coating or film, or heat reflecting layer, on the surface to be bonded to the other glass sheet, and the other glass sheet has a similar heat reflecting layer on one of its two surfaces, which may be the inner surface or the outer surface. The glass sheet may selectively be a clear glass, a tinted glass with a heat absorption capability, a heat treated, reinforced glass or a glass specially treated by sodium or potasium ion exchange processes.Each glass sheet is provided with a coating or film on one of its two surfaces, the coating or film being a deposited layer of a transparent metal or metallic oxide and capable of reflecting solar rays, or solar heat to become a heat reflecting layer, by a plating or coating process, whichever applicable. The bonding material may preferably made of polyvinylbutyral or the like, in order to provide a shatter proof capability. However, other materials, such as epoxy resins, polyruethane resins, ethylene polyvinyl acetate, or polycarbonate, etc. may also be conveniently used. The bonding material may preferably be clear or colorless, or tinted, as desired. The glass sheet unit of this invention provides several advantages and options, such as 1 light will be refracted only once before being reflected by the heat reflecting layer, and therefore no duplicated virtual image will be produced 2 the unit provides dual heat reflecting capabilities as the compo sition of the unit is constituted by a laminated of an inboard side glass sheet, an inboard side heat freflecting layer, a layer of bonding material, an outboard side heat reflecting layer, and an outboard side glass sheet or a laminate of an inboard side glass sheet, an inboard side heat reflecting layer, a layer of bonding material, an outboard side glass sheet, and an outboard side heat reflecting layer thus solar rays that are not reflected by the outboard side heat reflecting layer will be reflected by the inboard side heat refecting layer 3 the thickness of the layer of bonding material may vary from 0.01 mm up to 50 mm depending upon the desired mechanical strength and sound proof capability of the glass sheet unit 4 the sheet glasses and the layer of bonding material may be selectively tinted to adjust the tone of the vision, or to reduce glare 5 the two heat reflecting layers may be selectively tinted with varying degrees of darkness to adjust the tone of the image produced by the glass sheet unit, or to modify the vision 6 the layer of bonding material may be provided with an ultraviolet ray absorbing agent, or reinforcing wires if a high degree of security is desired. Fig. 2 shows a first embodiment of the glass sheet unit of this invention, which consists of laminate of a first glass sheet 1, a first transparent heat reflecting layer 3, a layer of bonding material 2, a second transparent heat reflecting layer 4, and a second glass sheet 5 wherein first glass sheet 1 is an inboard side glass sheet and second glass sheet 5 is an outboard side glass sheet when used in the curtain wall of a building, or as a window glass. The first transparent heat reflecting layer 3 is formed on the outboard side surface of first glass sheet 1, and the second transparent heat reflecting layer 4 is formed on the inboard side surface of second glass sheet 5.The first and second glass sheets may be clear i.e., colorless or tinted and may also be ordinary glass, heat treated, or glass reinforced by sodium or potasium ion exchange processes, having a thickness of 2 mm up to 15 mm. First and second transparent heat reflecting layer 3 and 4 may be a coating or film of transparent metal or metallic oxide plated or deposited on the glass sheet surface before the glass sheets are bonded. The transparent metal may be selected from the group consisting of gold, silver, paradinum, nickel, aluminum, copper, chromium and titanium, or an oxide of one of these metals, or a mixture thereof.The reflection rate of the heat reflecting layer may be over 18 , and the thickness of the heat reflecting layer may be 400at to 2000 . The bonding material may be of two part type epoxy cement, one part type epoxy ccment, an ultravilot sensitive type cement, or a thermal setting type cement or a resin selected from the group consisting of polyurethane, ethylenepolyvinylacetate, methacrylate and polyvinylbutyral.Its thickness may be 0.01 mm to 50 mm the thicker the thickness of the layer of bonding material, the greater the sound proof capability of the glass sheet unit. Fig. 3 shows a second embodiment of the glass sheet unit of this invention, which comprises a laminate of a first glass sheet 1, a first transparent heat reflecting layer 3, a layer ofDbonding material 2, a second glass sheet 5, and a second transparent heat reflecting layer 4. The details of each member are the same as in the case of first embodiment as described above, except that in the second embodiment the second transparent heat reflecting layer 4 is at the outboard side of second sheet glass 5. In a third embodiment of this invention, not shown in the drawings, one of the two glass sheets is replaced by a transparent, polycarbonate resin sheet having a shock proof capability 200 times the strength of an ordinary glass sheet of the same thickness. The thickness of such a polycarbonate resin sheet may be 1 3 to 1 5 that of the glass sheet on the opposite side of the laminate. It is a natural phenomenon that light is refracted when entering a transparent substance of a certain density into another transparent substance of a different density.Glass material refracts light entering from air at the rate of 1.52 polycarbonate, 1.55 polyvinylbutyral, 1.48 to 1.49 polyurethane, 1.5 to 1.6 epoxy resin, 1.55 to 1.56 and methacrylate resin 1.49. It is evident fromFig. 1 that when light from the inboard side of a conven tional laminated glass sheet unit passes two transparent substances of different densities such as a glass sheet and a layer of bonding material before being reflected by the heat reflecting layer, the light is bound to be refracted twice and a duplicated virtual image is therefore produced when viewed outwards from the inboard side of the glass sheet unit. Such a duplicated virtual image is more significant with a laminate having a thicker layer of bonding material.A tinted glass sheet at the inboard side of the glass sheet unit will only dilute the vision of such a duplicated virtual image to a limited extent. In the glass sheet units of this invention, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, light from the inboard side passes a layer of glass sheet or polycarbonate sheet before being reflected by the heat reflecting layer, therefore the light is refracted only once when it enters from the air to layer of glass sheet or polycarbonate sheet, without producing a duplicated virtual image. The arrangement of the laminate as shown in Figs. 2 and 3 allows a thicker layer of bonding material without fear of producing an unpleasant virtual image, and a thicker layer of bonding material further enables incorporation of a sufficient amount of an ultraviolet ray absorption agent in the bonding material, and also allows the insertion of reinforcing wires of substantial size in the layer of bonding material. A thicker layer of bonding material also renders more effective heat insulation and sound proof capability. The two heat reflecting layers can be selectively tinted to adjust the tone of the vision as desired, and also provide option of reversing the arrangement of the glass sheet unit with respect to the direction of light to be regulated. Therefore, it can be concluded without question that the glass sheet unit of this invention is novel and useful.
