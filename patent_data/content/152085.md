# Baling machine.

## Abstract
A baling machine, towed by a tractor, for forming large cylindrical bales of hay has a baling chamber 56 defined by oppositely moving runs 52, 54 of belts 49 trained over rolls. In order to avoid stray hay wrapping round the ends of a roll 26 and thence being ingested in bearings of the roll, a scraper assembly 86 is provided at either end of the roll. The sssemblies each comprise a spiral 88 which is welded to the roll and which moves the stray crop away from the end of the roll, and a scraper 90 in light contact with the spiral preventing the crop being carried round the roll by the spiral.
