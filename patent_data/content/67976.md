# Method for the preparation of cross linkable polymers.

## Abstract
Resins are prepared from polysulfone and polyethersul fone polymers that bear functional groups derived from compounds that are condensation products of amino phenols and acid anhydrides. The polymers are prepared by coreacting aromatic compounds holding two hydroxyl groups, aromatic compounds holding two active halogen groups, and the condensation product of aminophenol and acid anhydride, the condensation product holding one hydroxyl group. The resulting product has a molecular weight between about 1,000 and 40,000, preferably between about 5,000 and 30,000, and can be cross linked to form a resin that is thermoplastic and solvent resistant.
