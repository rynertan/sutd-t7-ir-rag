## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention is directed to a curable molding composition comprising an epoxide resin, a polyol, a hardener, and particular catalysts. Epoxide resins have been used in a variety of applications. Particularly, cycloaliphatic epoxides have inherently good electrical properties. However, formulations containing cycloaliphatic epoxides tend to be too reactive at low temperatures and tus have short pot life.Further, these formulations are not reactive enough at high temperatures and therefore cure too slowly.Curing these formulations faster results in short pot life. Pot life is the time available for use of the epoxy system after the resin and curing agent are mixed. Therefore, there is a desire to develop epoxide resin containing formulations with rapid cure times, long pot lives while maintaining. the good electrical and mechanical properties that the epoxide resin inherently possesses. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION It has now been found that the addition of a select group of catalysts to a curable molding composition comprising an epoxide resin, a polyol, ana a hardener results in a composition having long pot life and one which cures rapidly at elevated temperatures. Also, an article molded from such a composition has good electrical and mechanical properties after post cure. The catalysts which are used in this invention are characterized by the performance of the formulation containing 60 percent by weight of the total formulation of aluminum trihydrate filler in which they are incorporated. The formulation containing 1 he catalyst has a peak exotherm of 2100C or less, a t rne to peak exotherm of 10.5 minutes or less in a mold at 1500C, and the time for the viscosity of the formulation to reach 3000 centipoise at 800C is 30 minutes or greater or 60 minutes or greater for the formulation to reach a viscosity of 20,000 centipoise at 800C.

PREPARATION OF FOA ULATIONS In preparation for incorpation into a formulation, the filler was dried for about 12 hours in an air oven at 1000C. The other. ingredients were separately heated to BOOC in an air oven for about 30 minutes just prior to use. When used, solid catalysts were dissolved by stirring them into the anhydride during the period the ingredients are heated to 80 C. Liquid components of a formulation which were heated to 800C were rapidly mixed together by hand and the filler was rapidly stirred into the liquid composition. A timer was started to record pot life data. The hand mixed composition about 2 pounds total weight . was sheared on a CowlesDissolver for 60 seconds and then placed in a large vacuum chamber. The pressure was reduced to about 30 inches of mercury as read on a mechanical gauge to de aerate the mix. The vacuum was released as soon as the foam head which had formed collapsed, as seen through a viewpoint on the vacuum chamber. The time required for this procedure beginning with the starting of the timer was about five minutes The temperature of the formulation at this point was usually 80 20C. One half of the mix was immediately poured into an aluminum cavity mold which was pre heated to 1500C the mold cavity is 2 inches in diameter and 2 1 2 inches deep, the walls are 1 inch thick . The mold was situated in a circulating air oven at 1500C. The temperature of the mold was monitored by a thermocouple placed mid way in the mold wall.After filling the mold to within about 1 4 inch to 1 2 inch from the top, an aluminum cap at 15O0C was placed over the mold. The cap held a thermocouple in its center which protruded to the center of the formulation 1 inch from the mold wall and bottom inside surfaces . A strip recorder was used to follow the exotherm profile. Immediately after filling the mold cavity, the other half of the formulation was poured into an 8 ounce metal can. The can was placed in a circulatory silicone oil bath at 800C. A Brookfield viscometer Model HAT,Spindle N. 4, 20 RPM was used to follow the viscosity of the formulation with time. The first viscosity reading was routinely taken six minutes after the start of the time noted above. Pot life was measured by the time for the formulation to reach a specific viscosity at 800C 3000 centipoise and 20,000 centipoise . Cure speed was measured by the time from mold fill to peak exotherm in the 1500C cavity mold. Peak exotherm temperature was also recorded, Control A and Examples 1 to 7 The ingredients in Table I were formulated as described in Preparation of Formulations, supra and tested as described above.
