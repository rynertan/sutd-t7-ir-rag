# Connecting device with a heat recoverable metal driver member.

## Abstract
A reusable heat recoverable connecting device 20 has an annular driver member 22 and a circumferentially split annular spring biasing means 24 inside and generally concentric with the driver member 22 . The spring biasing means 24 exerts an outward radial force against the inside surface of the driver member 22 . The driver member is made from a heat recoverable metal having a martensitic state and an austenitic state. The driver member 22 is ex panded radially outward by the spring biasing means 24 when the driver member 22 is in its martensitic state to fa cilitate insertion of a substrate. The driver member 22 re covers to its non expanded dimension when it returns to its austenitic state to cause engagement between the spring biasing means 24 and the inserted substrate.
