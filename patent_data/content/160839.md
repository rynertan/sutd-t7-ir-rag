# Hydrofining process for hydrocarbon containing feed streams.

## Abstract
At least one decomposable molybdenum dithiophos phate compound is mixed with a hydrocarbon containing feed stream. The hydrocarbon containing feed stream con taining such decomposable molybdenum dithiophosphate compound is then contacted in a hydrofining process with a catalyst composition comprising a support selected from the group consisting of alumina, silica and silica alumina and a promotor comprising at least one metal selected from Group VIB, Group VIIB and Group VIII of the Periodic Table. The introduction of the decomposable molybdenum dithiophos phate compound may be commenced when the catalyst is new, partially deactivated or spent with a beneficial result occurring in each case.
