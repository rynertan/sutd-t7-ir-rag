# Faucet for dispensing beer or the like.

## Abstract
The faucet 1, 49 is provided with a faucet body 2 in which a channel 3 with a first channel part 5 is formed, which first channel part passes into a dispensing part 6 through an obtuse bend. Downstream of the bend of the channel 3 a valve seat 8 is formed, while a bore 19 directed away from the dispensing part 6 is formed in the faucet body 2 in a direct line with said dispensing part 6 , in which a valve stem 10 of a main valve 9 cooperating with the valve seat 8 extends. Thereby, the main valve 9 can be retracted at least partially out of the channel 3 into the bore 19 so that the faucet 1, 49 can be cleaned in the usual manner. Moreover, the pressure prevailing in the beer conduit acts on the main valve 9 in closing direction.
