# High frequency heating unit.

## Abstract
This invention is designed to make uniform the heating of the object inside the heating chamber 4 by turning an in ternal waveguide 8 which is roughly in a foldable fan shape and located at the bottom of the heating chamber in a structure adapted for feeding high frequency electric waves from the bottom of the heating chamber. In order to have stable gyration of the internal waveguide, and annular pro trusion 11 made of a low loss dielectric is placed between the low impedance parts provided on the internal wave guide and the heating chamber bottom surface. In this way, a rotary structure which is economical, easy to assemble and reliable can be realized.
