# Radiant fuser.

## Abstract
An instant on radiant fuser for fusing toner images in an electrostatographic copying machine, which does not re quire the use of any standby heating devices and yet is capable of fusing the first copy in a matter of seconds. The radiant fuser is made of a low mass reflector 22 thermally spaced from a housing 21 , with the housing 21 and the reflector 22 together forming a conduit for the passage of cooling air therein. A low mass platen 24 is provided which is constructed to achieve operating temperature conditions in a matter of a few seconds without the use of any standby heating device. A housing 28 for the platen 24 is also provided to form a conduit for the passage of cooling air to control the temperature of the platen.
