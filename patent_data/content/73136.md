# Photomask material.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a photomask material comprising a substrate, and at least one layer containing mixture of a metal oxide and a metal nitride or at least one metal nitride layer provided on the substrate, and the photomask material may comprise a substrate and a mask layer provided on the substrate, the mask layer consisting of a layer containing a lower metal oxide and or a lower metal nitride, and a layer containing a mixture of a higher oxide and a higher nitride of the same metal or a higher metal nitride layer of the same metal. The photomask material of the present invention ex hibits excellent resistance to the cleaning solutions and can be used repeatedly.
