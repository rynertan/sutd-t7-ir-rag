# Burst signal transmission system.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for the transmission of burst signals between two remote com munication terminals, namely a transmitter 40 and a receiver 50 . The transmitter 40 comprises a first bit detector 42 , a first bit control circuit 41 , a multi level encoder 43 and a burst transmitting circuit 44 . The receiver 50 comprises a burst receiving circuit 54 , a first symbol extractor 53 , a multi level decoder 52 and a first bit inversion control circuit 51 . The transmission method and apparatus suppress the DC component of a burst signal and shorten the burst length. This promotes the transmis sion of a significant amount of information even through a transmission line whose bandwidth is rather narrow, which facilitates economical use of the transmission line.
