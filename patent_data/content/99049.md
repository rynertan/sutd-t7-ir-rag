# Method for preparing silicone treated starch.

## Abstract
A method for treating starch with organosiloxane polymers is described in which the organosiloxane polymer is contacted with starch in an aqueous dispersion at a temperature of from 60 C to 98 C for a period of at least 60 seconds. Starch treated by this method can be useful as glue, a binder, a filler, or a coating. Starch treated with aminoalkyl or epoxyalkyl substituted polydimethylsiloxane is especially useful as a water repellent sizing for substrates such as paper and textiles.
