# A self purging separator.

## Abstract
A self purging separator for separating impurities from fluid intermittently pumped from a well or the like having a segregating device adapted to be received in such a well for segregating impurities from the fluid for descent of the impurities in such a well and a valve below the segregating device for accumulating the descending impurities when the fluid is being pumped and releasing such impurities for further gravitational descent in such well when the pumping is interrupted.
