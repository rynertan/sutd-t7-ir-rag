# A TTL circuit.

## Abstract
A TTL circuit comprising an inverted signal output transistor Tr₄ and an off buffer circuit Tr₂, Tr₃ alternatively turned on and off in response to an input signal to provide an inverted output, having two driving circuits Tr₅, Tr₆ for driving the inverted signal output transistor Tr₄ and for driving the off buffer circuit Tr₂, Tr₃ separately provided. The threshold voltage of the circuit Tr₆ for driving the off buffer circuit Tr₂, Tr₃ is lower than the threshold voltage of the circuit Tr₅ for driving the inverted signal output transistor Tr₄ , whereby no transient current flows through the off buffer circuit Tr₂, Tr₃ and the inverted signal output transistor Tr₄
