# Metal forming lubricant.

## Abstract
A lubricant for metal forming comprises a dispersion of particles of a waxy material in a solution or dispersion in a volatile liquid medium of a monomeric organic carrier which is a solid or a viscous liquid at ambient temperature. The particles may be 5 25 microns, the volatile liquid may be xylene, the carrier may be an ester with a MW below 320 and the weight ratio of particles to carrier may be 1 1 to 6 1. The waxy particles provide good lubricating performance with out coalescing under load. The lubricant is compatible with adhesives and is easily removed from a workpiece.
