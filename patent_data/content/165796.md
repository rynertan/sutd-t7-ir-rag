# AN INSTRUMENT FOR MEASURING RESISTANCE

## Abstract
An instrument for measuring internal resistance of a wiring installation includes a switching arrangement 13, 14, 15 to connect a load resistance temporarily across output terminals of the installation. An integration circuit 22 integrates a voltage developed across the output terminals, over respective predetermined intervals of time, in the loaded and unloaded conditions. The integrated values are utilised to evaluate the internal resistance.
