# Metal band and drive block assembly.

## Abstract
A metal band and drive block assembly has one or more continuous metal bands 12 which slidabiy support a plurality of drive blocks 14 . Each drive block 14 has a transverse arcuate surface having a radius dimension A substantially equal to or 1 less than a transverse radius dimension B of the metal band. Each drive block also has an opening 28 which facilitates band assembly the opening is outwardly divergent, and terminates inwardly in a slot 34, 36 at the transverse arcuate surface. The opening 28 permits flexing of the metal bands 12 during assembly of the metal bands and the drive blocks 14 without the yield stress of the metal bands being exceeded, and the inner slot 34, 36 provides a retaining mechanism for the metal bands 12 after assembly.
