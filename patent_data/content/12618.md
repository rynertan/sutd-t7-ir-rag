# Electrolysis cell.

## Abstract
Known electrolysis cells used for producing chlorine for sanitising and sterilisation purposes deteriorate due to accummulation of scale on the electrodes thereof. This problem is solved by an improved cell 10 comprising an outer electrode 12 having an in facing surface 14 which defines a first cylindrical surface 16 , and an inner, generally coaxial electrode 34 having an out facing surface 38 which defines a second cylindrical surface 40 . The second cylindrical surface 40 lies radially inward of the first cylindrical surface 16 . The outer and inner electrodes 12 and 34 are longitudinally coextensive for at least a substantial portion thereof. The inner and outer electrodes 12 and 34 are rotable relative to one another. An abrading structure 98 is mounted to one of the electrodes 34 with an abrasive portion 100 thereof in abrasive contact with the other of the electrodes 12 . The abrading structure 98 is electrically insulated from at least one of the electrodes. The electrodes 12 and 34 are supported in electrically insulating relation to one another within a cell cavity 36 .
