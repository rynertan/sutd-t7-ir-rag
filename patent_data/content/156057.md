# SOLID CAST DETERGENT DISPENSER WITH INSERT FOR HOLDING NONCOMPATIBLE CHEMICALS

## Abstract
A dispenser 10 for a detergent 13 is disclosed. A hous ing 10 defining an inner cavity 12 holds the detergent 13 . The cavity 12 has a circular opening. An insert 14 of a substance not chemically compatible with the detergent 13 is retained in the opening of the inner cavity 12 . The insert 14 is retained by retaining ring 20 and a cover 26 . In a preferred embodiment, the retaining ring 20 defines an inner aperture 21a and has a plurality of generally upwardly extending resilient fingers 24 cooperatively connected to the retaining ring 20 proximate the inner aperture 21b . A cover 26 is cooperatively connected to and secured by the fingers 24 , wherein said insert 14 is placed over said fingers 24 and said cover 26 over said insert 14 , whereby said fingers 24 and said cover 26 control the dissolving of the insert 14 by controlling the surface area of the insert 14 exposed to the detergent solution. A spray forming nozzle 15 is mounted to and extends into the cavity 12 through the opening for direct ing a pressurized spray of liquid at the detergent. The hyd raulic action of the nozzle directed spray 16 dissolves a portion of the detergent 13 , forming a detergent solution which passes by gravity over the insert 14 and dissolves a portion of the insert 14 , and the detergent solution and dissolved insert are discharged through the opening.
