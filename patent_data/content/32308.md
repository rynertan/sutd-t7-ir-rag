# ETHYLENE POLYMERISATION PROCESS

## Abstract
Ethylene is polymerised, or copolymerised with another olefin monomer, using a catalyst system comprising an organic metal compound and a titanium containing material which is obtained by reacting together an inert particulate material, an organic magnesium compound, a halogen containing compound such as carbon tetrachloride, silicon tetrachloride, trichlorosilane, phosphorus trichloride or boron trichloride, and titanium tetrachloride. The process can be used to effect copolymerisation of ethylene with an alpha olefin monomer such as butene 1 in a fluidised bed reactor.
