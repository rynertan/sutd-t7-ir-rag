## Description
CARBONATE POLYACRYLATES, RADIATION CURABLE COATING COMPOSITIONS AND METHOD OF CURING This application relates to novel carbonate polyacrylate or poly alaylacrylate monomers whicn are suitable for radiation curable coatings, particularly for curing by ultraviolet or electron beam. These compositions may also be employed as reactive diluents for other acrylate and alkylacrylate resinous materials to produce strong and useful coatings. The carbonate polyacrylate and carbonate poly alkylacrylate monomers of this invention have the formulaEMI1.1 in which R1 is H or C1 C4 alkyl, preferably H or CH3 R2 and R4 are alkylene radicals of 2 to 6 carbon atoms which may contain oxygen in the alkylene chain to form an alkylene ether or poly alkylene ether radicals naving 2 to 6, preferaoly 2 or 3 carbon atoms in the alkylene moiety R3 is a polyvalent radical derivea from alkyl of 1 to 12 carbon atoms, alkylene ether or polyalkylene ether containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the alkylene group, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl of 5 to 12 carbon atoms, phenyl or substituted phenyl and n is 2 to 6. Preferred cycloalkyl radicals are cyclopentyl and particularly cyclohexyl which can be substitutea, for example by alkyl groups. The pnenyl radical can oe substitutec with non interfering suostituents such as C1 C4 alkyl C1 C4 alKoxy halogen, particularly chloro, cyano, nitro and the like. Particularly suitable R3 moieties are ethylene, propylene poly ethylene glycol and poly propyleneglycol radicals. The acrylates and metnacrylates in which R1 is H or methyl, respectively, are preferred. The carbonate polyacrylate compounds of this invention can be made by methods which are in themselves known. For example, the polycaroonates of formula I can be prepared by reacting a suitable hydroxy substituted acrylate with phosgene to form the chloroformate which can then be reacted with the appropriate polyol containing tneR3 moiety. Alternatively, diphenyl carbonate can be substituted for phosqene. Analogously, a polyhydroxy compound containing tneR3 moiety.can be converted to the cnloroformate or phenylcarbonate by reaction with phosgene or dipnenylcaroonate and this intermediate reacted with the desired hydroxy acrylate. The compounds of formula II are prepared in a manner also known for example as shown in U.S. Patent 3,619,260. Briefly, two or more moles of tne desired nydroxyacrylate are reacted with a mole of phosgene preferably in the presence of an acia acceptor such as a tertiary amine. An acid acceptor is desirable in any of the describea preparative reactions involving phosgene. The carbonate polyacrylate compounds of this invention and mixtures thereof are useful in a variety of applications which are in themselves known for other monomers, particularly acrylate monomers. These compounds and mixtures are especially suitable for use alone, or in mixtures with other monomers as radiation curable coatings. Curing of the compositions containing the carbonate polyacrylate compounds disclosed herein can De accomplished with radiation, advantageously with electron Deam or ultraviolet radiation. When ultraviolet radiation is utilized incorporation of a Dhotosensitizer in the composition is desirable. Typical pnotosensitizers are oenzopnenone ano benzoin etners such as tne ethyl or butyl ethers, out tnese are merely illustrative as many photosensitizers are known in the art and are commercially available. The compositions containing the carbonate polyacrylate monomers of this invention are suitable for coating a variety of substrates includiny metals, wood, paper and plastics. The invention is illustrated by the following example in which the parts are oy weight. EXAMPLE A solution was prepared by dissolving 46.4 parts of 2 hydroxyetnyl acrylate, 38.0 parts of pyridine, 0.5 parts of 4 dimethylaminopyrfidine, 0.02 parts of 4,4 methyleneDis 2,6 di t butylphenol and 200 parts of dry toluene. To it was added 46.2 parts of diethylene glycol bis cnloroformate in 20 minutes. The reactants were then heated at 700C for 2.hours. After cooling, solia precipitates were filtered and the solvents removed by vacuum distillation. The reaction product is radiation curable alone or in mixtures with other radiation curable monomers to yield a useful coating.
