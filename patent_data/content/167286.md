This reaction may be conventionally characterized as a Friedel Crafts acetylation of phenol with acetic acid as the acetylating agent.Simons et al, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 61, 1795 and 1796 1939 teach the acylation of aromatic compounds using hydrogen fluoride as a condensing agent and in Table 1 on page 1796 shcrw the acetylation of phenol with acetic acid to produce p hydroxyacetophenone 4 HAP in 40 yield. European Patent Publication No.69,597, published January 12, 1983, discloses the preparation of p phenoxybenzoyl compounds by reacting diphenyl ether and an appropriate acyl compound such as acetic anhydrids in the presence of hydrogen fluoride.Meussdoerffer et al, German Offenlegungsschrift 26 16 986 publishedOctober r 27, 1977 and assigned to Bayer AS, disclose the hydrogen fluoride catalyzed acylation of phanolic compounds such as phenol itsalf with an acyl halide such as acetyl chloride to form hydroxy aromatic ketones. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIn accordance with this invention, 4 hydroxyacetophenone 4 HAP is produced by the Friedel Crafts acetylation of phenol with acetic acid or acetic anhydride using hydrogen fluoride as catalyst, under certain specified reaction coalitions so as to obtain unexpectedly high conver sions of phenol and high selectivity to 4 HAP, concurrentyl.In one embodiment of the present invention, the preparation of 4 HAP by the a acetylation of phenol with acetic acid using hydrogen fluoride as catalyst proceeds in accordance with the following equation I EMI2.1 In carrying out the reaction so as to obtain particularly high yields of 4 HAP within this invention, phenol is reacted with about 0.9 to 1.4 moles, preferably abcut 1.0 to 1.25 moles of a acetic acid per mole of phenol at a temperature of reaction of about 40 to 900C, preferably about 50 to 800C in the presence of hydrogen fluoride catalyst in an amount of about 20 to 50 moles, preferably about 25 to 30 moles, per role of phenol for a reaction period of about 10 to 120 mirnites, preferably about 30 to 75 minutes.In another embodiment of the present invention when 4 HAP is prepared from phenol and acetic anhydride, the amount of acetic anhydride employed may range from about 0.4 to about 2.0 moles per mole of phenol. Wen about 0.9 to 2.0 moles of a acetic anhydride per role of phenol is employed, using HF as the catalyst, the reaction proceeds in accordance with the following equation II EMI3.1 Thus, in carrying out the reaction so as to obtain particularly high yields of 4 HAP within one aspect of this embodiment of the invention, phenol is reacted with about 0.9 to 2.0 poles, preferably about 1.0 to 1.1 moles of acetic anhydride per mole of phenol at a temperature of reaction of about 30 to 90 C, preferably about 40 to 80 C in the presence of hydrogen fluoride catalyst in an amount of about 8 to 60 moles, preferably about 15 to 40 moles per mole of phenol for a reaction period of at least about 10, preferably about 10 to 300 minutes, and most preferably about 30 to 180 minutes, said temperature of reaction being at least about 45 c when said number of moles of hydrogen fluoride per role of phenol is no greater than about 12.In accordance with another aspect, also using acetic anhydride as the acetylating agent, the amount of acetic anhydride employed is approximately cne half mole per mole phenol, such as fran about 0.4 to about 0.8 moles of acetic anhydride per mole of phenol.In such an instance, the anhydride initially added reacts with an equivalent of phenol reactant to produce an equivalent of 4 HAP, yielding a corresponding equivalent of free acetic acid as a by product. Additional phenol reactant then reacts with the liberated acetic acid in the same reactor to produce an additional amount of 4 HAP. If one half mole of anhydride per mole of phenol is used, the result will be a balanced process with a theoretical yield of one mole of 4 HAP per mole of phenol reactant. If a somewhat larger amount of anhydride is used than one half mole per role of phenol reactant, an excess of free acid will be produced, while if somewhat less anhydride is used, not all the phenol reactant will be used up in the reaction, i.e., some phenol reactant will remain at the end of the reaction.The process employing about one half mole of acetic antrydride per mole of phenol proceeds as follows in accordance with equations I and IV EMI4.1 When one half mole of acetic anhydride is employed per mole of phenol reactant, the reactions of the overall process may be described as in equation V EMI4.2 As stated above, in accordance with the foregoing aspect of the present invention, the phenol reactant is reacted with about 0.4 to 0.8 moles, preferably about 0.45 to 0.55 moles and rost preferably about 0.5 mole, of acetic anhydride per mole of phenol at a temperature of reaction, for example, of about 0 to 100 C, in the presence of HF for a reaction period, for example, of about 15 to 120 minutes, preferably about 30 to 75 minutes. An excess of HF is generally used, for example, about 8 to 60 roles per mole of phenol reactant initially present in the reaction zone. In general, the tEmperature of reaction will be in the range, for example, of about 30 to 900C, preferably about 40 to 800C. In accordance with all embodiments and aspects of the present invention, using a corrcsion resistant reactor, the reaction is initiated by either 1 charging hydrogen fluoride to a mixture of phenol and a acetic acid anhydride at a temperature less than the specified reaction temper ature 2 charging a acetic acianhydride to a solution of phenol and hydrogen fluoride at reaction temperature Or 3 charging acetic acid anhydride and phenol simultaneously to hydrogen fluoride at reaction temperature.Regardless of the method of initially mixing the acetic acid anhydride, phenol, and hydrogen fluoride, the reaction is then adjusted to the specified reaction temperature for the specified reaction period. me hydrogen fluoride may be charged as a liquid or a gas using tecnologies of handling well knawn to those skilled in the art.In carrying cut the reaction, an inert gas sudi as nitrogen may be used to keep the reaction space under the desired pressure, about 2.5 to about 500 psig. 0.17 to 34.48 bar , thereby keeping sufficient HF in contact with the reacting liquid.The embodiment of this invention using acetic acid as the acetylating agent results in a conversion of phenol of at least about 80 , preferably at least about 90 , with a selectivity to 4 hydroxyacetophenone 4 HAP of at least about 70 , preferably at least about 80 . In general, the ensnt of this invention using about 0.9 to 2.0 moles of acetic anhydride per mole of phenol results in a conversion of phenol of at least about 90 , preferably at least about 95 , with a selectivity to 4 hydroxyacetophenone 4 HAP of at least about 70 , preferably at least about 90 . about about 0.4 to 0.8 roles of acetic anbedbride per mole of phenol is used as the acetylating agent, the press results in a conversion of phenol of at least about 80 , preferably at least about 90 , with a selectivity to 4 hydroxyacetophenone 4 HAP of at least 70 , preferably at least about 90 .The aspect of this invention using about 0.5 mole of a acetic anhydride per mole of phenol may result in economy of production as compared to the process utilizing on the order of one mole of anhydride or free acetic acid per role of phenol reactant as acetylating agent since a considerably smaller quantity of anhydride is employed in this process than the quantity of anhydride or acid in the other processes. Moreover product purification is simpler using such an aspect of this invention since considerably less than one mole of water per mole of phenol reactant need be removed fran the product whereas close to one mole of acetic acid or water must be removed when the process utilizes about one mole of arhydride or acid per role of phenol reactant. Such simpler purification also results in less HF loss. me present invention is capable of producing relatively high yields of 4 hydroxyacetophenone using relatively low ratios of hydrogen fluoride to phenol and low temperatures of reaction. This in turn results in a more economical purification of product and recycle of hydrogen fluoride, and an energy saving due to the low reaction temperatures which are employed.

The mixture was warmed to 80 C and maintained at that temperature for one hour with stirring. me contents of the reactor were cooled to 40 C and the hydrogen fluoride was then vented through a caustic scrubber for one hour while simultaneously using a nitrogen prrge. The product of the reaction was extracted with 10 mL ethyl acetate, 50 mL of water were added and the pH of the resulting aqueous phase was adjusted to 7.0 using a solution of 45 potassium hydroxide. The aqueous phase was extracted with 50 mL of ethyl acetate 2x . The organic extracts were combined, rinsed with a saturated sodium chloride solution, and the solvent was removed on a rotary evaporator to yield a crystalline product. The reaction proceeded with 97.5 conversion of phenol and with the indicated selectivities to 4 hydroxyacetophenone 64.7 , 2 hydroxyacetopheone 4.6 , and 3 hydroxyacetophenone 0.1 .
