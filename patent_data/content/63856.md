## Description
MEMO CARD ORGANISER The present invention relates to passive information organising devices and more partioularly to those which include a number of memo cards, credit cards, pictures or other information vehicles and a carrier or holder having vehlcle receiving openings. In the past, information vehicle ho .dere of this type have been provided with one or more pockets or slots, each having a single opening into which one or more information vehicles were inserted. U.S. PatentNo. 4008742 is an example of such a device whic n discloses a credit card holder having slitted outer layer in which one slit is provided for each card and a liner having a plurality of card receiving flaps which 1 inserted behind the slitted layer. The present information organiser, in contrast, has a relatively simpler construction in which a pair of opposing and converging openings are provided for each information vehicle in one outer layer of the holder. In addition to Patent No.4008742, U.S. Patent No.2532132 and U.S.Patent No. 3073052 represent the closest prior art known to the applicants.Patent No. 2532132 discloses a card or picture holder provided with a multiplicity of generally W shaped slits which form fingers that inte connect with the various edges of the card. The present information organiser, in contrast, has a larder capacity because the opposing openings provided therein actually receive portions of the information vehicle and because the construotion of the openings allows the information vehiclos to lie in overlapping relationship with one another. Patent No. 3073052 discloses an index card holder having a plurality of inverted, generally U shaped, card receiving slits lying on a common axis of symmetry. The present information organiser, in contrast, is sturdier because the vehicle receiving openings converge but do not m et, thereby minimising the disruption in the integrity and strength of the material in which the slits are formed. The present passive information organisin. device comprises, in combination, one or more information vehicles formed from sheet material and an information vehicle holder having one or more pairs of relatively opposing, vehicle receiving openings. The vehicle cceiving openings tre continuously separated from one another and are disposed to removably receive an information vehicle Each of the vehicle reciving openings has a converging portion which converges towards the opposing, vehiclereceiving opening. The primary objects of the present information organising device are to display simultaneously a portion of each information vehicle releasably housed therein, to permit the information vehicles to be variably organised, to form a sufficiently compact structure that it may be housed in a notebook or pocket sized folder and to provide a durable structure which is simple and economical to construct. The invention will now be described further, by way of example., with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig.l is a front elevation of one form of informatIon vehicle holder, with two credit cards or other information vehicles removably received therein Fig.2 is a side elevation of the informatior organising device shown in Fig.l Fig.3 is a perspective view of another form of information organiser adapted for use in a rocket sized folder and provided with vehicle receiving openings having outwardly ang ed guide portions Fig.4 is a front elevational view of yet another form of the invention adapted for use in a notebook and provided with a plurality of pairs of vehicle receiving openings arranged In two vertically aligned rows Fig.5 is a front elevation of a preferred form of the information vehicle provided with peripheral surface portion which contrast in colour with adjacent surface portions of the information vehicle Pig.6 is a vertical sectional view of the Information organiser on the line 6 6 of FIg.4 and Fig.7 is a fragmented, vertioal section similar to Fig.6, particularly illustrating an alternative form of construction for the intermediate layer of the Information vehicle holder. As illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, the present information organising device, generally designated 10, is a substantially passive structure comprising one or more Information vehicles 11 formed from sheet material, and an information vehicle holder 12 having one or more pairs of relatively opposing, vehicle receiving openings, generally designated 13, continuously separated from one another and disposed to removably receive therein an information vehicle 11. Each of the vehicle receiving openings j.3 has a converging portion 17a which converges towards the opposing vehicle receiving opening 1 1x and whIch, in the embodiment illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, runs the entire length of the vehiclereceiving opening 13. The converging portions 13a of the opposing vehicle receiving openings permit information vehicles of various dimensions to be removably received therein. The information vehicles 11 may be any of a variety of relatively planar objects upon which various information may be provided, such as credit cards, photographs, index cards or relatively small sheets of paper.Since the opposing, vehicle receiving openings 13 do not meet, the vehicle rec.eiving holder 12 forms a seat 15 between the lower ends 13b of each pair of opposing openings 13 against which the lending edge portion 11a of the vehicle 11 abuts.In this manner, the vehicle receiving holder 12 may be formed from a single layer of material without requiring additional flaps or pouches.Preferably, the holder 12 is formed from flexible material which bows somewhat when an information vehicle 11 is inserted therein, so that the vehicle may be more easily inserted and withdrawn and In order to reduce wear and tear on the various structures. The pairs of opposing, vehicle receiving openings 13 are preferably arranged in at least one longitudinally aligned row and are disposed to receive less than the entire length of the relatively opposing, lateral odge portions 11b and 11c of the information vehiole. Similarly, the seats 15 formed between the lower ends 13b of the opposing openings e aligned on a common axis of symmetry. In this manner, the information vehicles 11 lie in overlapping relationship to each other, w.th a portion of each vehicle projecting above the vehicle lying lmmediately above I . As illustrated in Fig.3, each of the opposin. vehicle receivin, openings 13 may be provided with a guide portion 13c which is concinuous with and is angled obtusely and laterally outwardly from the converging portion 13a. The distance between the outelthost ands of the guide portions 13c located on opposing vehicle receiving openings 13 is greater than the distance between the relatively opposing, lateral edge portions 11b and lle of the information vehicle 11 inserted there bet ,een, the guide portions therefore provide entrances for the information vehicle into the opposing opening, further reduce wear and tcar on the present device and facilitate insertion and removal of the vehicle 11. Fib 5 also illustrates, in outline form, z billfold or other pocketsized folder 16 into which the present information organiser may be inserted. As illustrated in Fig.5, the present information organiser may be provided with one or more information vehicles 11 which are substantially square pieces of sheet material. Notes or other information may be provided thereon and since a portion of each vehicle preferably projects beyond the vehicle lying immediately above it, the square vehicle may be inserted into its respective openings 13 in four different directions to expose various portions of the information provided on the vehicle. In addition, the information vehicle is preferably provided with a border 17 on its peripheral surface portion which contrasts in colour with the adjacent interior surface 18 of the vehicle.In this manner, a plurality of inform action vehicles lying in overlapping relationship in their respective opposing openinings 13 are visually more distinguishable from one another. Fig.4 illustrates another modification of the present invention wherein the information vehicle holder 12 is inserted into a loose leaf notebook 19, and the pairs of relatively opposing, vehlcle receiving openings 13 are arranged in two, spaced apart, longitudinally aligned rows. Figs. 6 and 7 illustrate preferred forms of internal construction for the vehicle holder 12 adopted for use in the loose leaf notebook 1 illustrated in Fig.4. As Indicated in both Figs. 6 and 7, the holder 12 preferably provided with at least one intermediated layer 20 of relatively rigid sheet material and with an outer layer 21 of relatively flexible material having first and second portions 21a and 21b dispersed on opposite sides, respectively, of the intermediate layer 20.The intermediate layer 20 is substantially uninterrupted, but each of the first and second portions 21a and 21b of the outer layer 21 are provided with a plurality of pairs of vehicle receiving openings 13. Thus, the holder is adapted to receive information vehicles 11 on both sides of the pave. The Information vehicle holders illustrated in Figs. 6 and 7 are distinguishable in that the intermediate layer 20 of Fig.G is formed from a relatively rigid, central layer 20a of cardboard sheet material enveloped in a layer 20b of synthetic resin material. h single intermediate layer 20 of relatively rigid synthetic resin material is provided inFig. 7. The outer layer 21 of the holder 11 in both Figs. 6 and 7 is preferably formed from rolatively flexible, synthetic resin material.Reforring to Fig.41 one will note the outer edges 22 and longitudinally extending stripes 23 of the holder 12 are formed preferably by conventional heat sealing processes. In this manner, the first and second portions 21a and 21b of the outer layer 21 are secured to each other along the outer edges 22 and to the intermediate layer 20 along the longitudinally extending stripes 23, and the guide portions 13c of the vehicle receiving openings 13 are prevented from extending laterally outwardly.
