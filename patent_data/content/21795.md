# Couplings for tubes.

## Abstract
A tube coupling has a collet 13 with resilient arms 16 arranged to co operate with an internal cam surface 21 on a member 10 surrounding the collet 13 so that the collet arms 16 are forced radially inwardly to grip a tube 12 more tightly if the tube 12 and collet 13 are pulled in the axial direction outwardly of said member 10. Improved sealing means are provided around the tube comprising an O ring 29 with means, e.g. a spring or a member 30 threaded in said body, for applying axial compression to the O ring 29 thereby forcing it to deform radially into tight engagement with the tube 12, thereby enabling good sealing to be obtained even for low fluid pressures in the fluid passing through the coupling.

## Description
COUPZINGS FOR TUBES This invention relates to couplings for tubes and is more particularly coiicerned with a tube coupling of the kind having a collet with resilient arms arranged to co operate with a cam surface on a member surrounding the collet, which member has an internal surface tapering in one axial direction and engaging the arms of the collet so that the arms are forced radially inwardly by axial movement of the collet in said one direction. With such a tube coupling, the collet is arranged so that said one direction is the direction of withdrawal of the tube from the member. The end of the tube is pushed into the coupling in the Opposite direction through the collet. Any outward pull on the tube with respect to said member tends, by the engagement between the collet and the tube, to pull the collet in said one direction thereby causing the arms, by engagement with the cam surface, to grip the tube more tightly. Such a coupling thus serves to hold the tube in said member the end of the tube can be inserted directly into the coupling and is engaged thereby in a manner which prevents withdrawal of the tube merely by a pull thereon. The tube can be released however by pushing the collet inwardly into said member whilst pulling the tube outwardly. This release can only be effected by a deliberate action and not by an accidental pull on the tube. It is commonly required to seal the tube in said coupling and it is the usual practice to provide an O ring within the bore in said member inwardly of the collet, theO ring fitting tightly around the end of the tube. If there is any leakage of fluid between the end of the tube and said member, the fluid pressure tends to force the O ring back against the collet and thus serves not only to apply pressure to the collet in a direction tightening the grip of the collet arms and tube but also serves to deform the O ring to hold it more tightly against the tube and the surrounding surface of said member. With such couplings, the higher the pressure of the fluid, the better is the seal. There are however often circumstances in which the advantages of the simple and quick mitLng and releasing og the coupling would be desirable but In watch the fluid pressure is low, for example below 20 p.5.1. It is an object of the present invention to provide improved sealing at low pressures in a tube coupling of the kind described. According to this invention, in a tube coupling of the kind having a collet with resilient arms arranged to co operate with a cam surface on a body member surrounding the collet, which body member has an internal surface tapering to a smaller diameter in one axial direction and engaging the arms of the collet so that the collet arms are forced inwardly by axial movement of the collet in said one direction, and in which a resilient annular member is provided in said body member with means for compressing said annular element axially so as to deform it radially inwardly. Operation of said compressing means thus enables the resilient annular member, which is conveniently an O ring, to be forced into sealing engagement around the outer surfaces of a tube inserted into the coupling through the collet. In one arrangement the resilient annular member is provided between the collet and an internal shoulder on a support for the resilient annular member, an annular element is provided in the coupling between the resilient annular member and the sollet, which annular element is adjustably secured in said support so that it can be positioned to hold the resilient annular member in compression against said shoulder. When the resilient annular memher is. compressed in the axial direction, it expands radially inwardly and outwardly and it is thus forced into sealing engagement with the tube.The axial compression holds the resilient annular member in sealing engagement against the shoulder in said support arid preferable the internal bore in said support is such that the compression of the resilient member causes it to be forced into sealing engagement with the surrounding surface of said support. It will be seen therefore that, by adjustment of the position of said annular element, the resilient member can be deformed to give a tight seal irrespective of any fluid pressure of the fluid passing through the coupling, the resilient member being deformed to seal into surface irregularities in the tube surface.This is of particular importance in the case of low pressure fluids. If there is fluid leakage around the end of the tube onto the resilient annular member, and if the fluid pressure is sufficiently high to compress the resilient member further, it will improve the sealing.However the provision of the annular element enables the resilient member to be axially compressed even in the absence of any fluid pressure. The aforementioned annular element is preferably a threaded element engaging an internal thread in said support so that the axial position of the annular element can be adjusted by rotation about the axis of the collet and body member. Very conveniently in such an arrangement, the collet and annular element are provided with mutually engaging portions such that the annular element can be rotated in said support by rotation of the collet. For example the annular element may have a castellated end and the collet arms may be formed to engage in the castellations.Conveniently in such an arrangement, alternate arms of the collet are of different length and the castellations comprise recesses for receiving the longer collet arms. In the simplest form, the support comprises a part of the body member. In this case, the annular element may have an external thread engaging an internal thread in a cylindrical portion of said body member. It may be preferred however in some cases to provide a support separate from the body member, the support being a holder for the resilient annular member and positioned within said body member, the annular element being threaded in said support for adjustment in the axial direction to enable the resilient member to be compressed between the annular element and a shoulder in the support and a further seal being provided between the support and said body member. This further seal may be another O ring around the support. The support may be axially movable in said body member between a shoulder and the collet member but locked against rotation in the body member. It will be appreciated that commonly the problem is to obtain effective sealing against the tube, which may have an uneven surface, The annular element enables this seal to be obtained as in the previously described construction. The further seal effects the sealing between the support and the body member where the problems of sealing are less severe, bearing in mind that the surfaces to be sealed together are pre formed as part of the coupling.The advantage of having the support axially movable in the body member is that, if there is high pressure fluid in the coupling, any leakage around the end of the tube will tend to move the support towards the collet and hence will tend to force the collet in the direction such that the collet arms are forced to grip the tube more tightly. The invention furthermore includes within its scope a tube coupling for holding a tube of predetermined external diameter comprising a body member having an internal bore, a collet fitting in said bore from one end thereof and an O ring around said tube adjacent a shoulder on the body member or on a support in the body member, which shoulder faces the end of the bore from which the collet is inserted, the bore in said body member, between the shoulder and the end from which the collet is inserted having a tapered portion tapering from a larger diameter portion down to a smaller diameter portion, and the collet having resilient arms with surface portions engaging the tapered surf ace on said body member so that the collet arms are forced radially inwardly to grip the tube as the collet is moved towards said end, and wherein an annular element is provided adjustable for movement to compress theO ring against said shoulder so as thereby to cause theO ring to seal tightly around said tube. In another construction, the means for compressing the resilient annular member comprises a spring. Thus the invention includes within its scope a tube coupling of the kind having a collet with resilient arms arranged to co operate with a cam surface on a member surrounding the collet, which member has an internal surface tapering to a smaller diameter in one axial direction and engaging the arms of the collet so that the collet arms are forced inwardly by axial movement of the collet in said one direction, and in which a resilient annular member, for example and O ring, is provided in said member between the collet and an internal shoulder in said member, wherein spring means are provided in the coupling between the collet and the resilient annular member operative when the collet is in said member to press the resilient annular member away from the collet in an axial direction against a shoulder in said member. The invention furthermore includes within its scope a tube coupling for holding a tube of predetermined external diameter comprising an outer member having an internal bore, a collet fitting in said bore from one end thereof and an O ring seal seated within said bore against a shoulder therein, which shoulder faces the end from which the collet is inserted, the bore in said member, between the shoulder and the end from which the collet is inserted having a tapered portion tapering from a larger diameter portion down to a smaller diameter portion, and the collet having resilient arms with surface portions engaging the tapered surface on said member so that the collet arms are forced radially inwardly as the collet is moved towards said end, and wherein spring means are provided in said bore operative to force the O ring away from the ends of the collet arms towards said shoulder. Preferably the O ring is made, in the known way, to fit resiliently over the tube. The axial pressure exerted by the spring means squeezes the O ring in the axial direction and hence causes it to expand radially inwardly and outwardly. The O ring is thus urged by the spring means into tight engagement with the tube and with the inner surface of the bore of said member surroulding the 0being. In the absence of any fluid pressure on the O ring, the O ring is also forced against the shoulder in said member so as to seal against the shoulder as well as against the surface of the tube.The provision of the spring means thus serves to give a goodv oeal against fluid leakage around the end of the tube, even in conditions where the fluid pressure is low. With a high fluid pressure, leakage will cause fluid pressure on the O ring forcing it away from the shoulder against the spring means, so further tending to deform the O ring in the radial direction and thereby improve the sealing against leakage. Preferably the aforesaid member, axially inwardly of said shoulder, has a second shoulder of smaller diameter against which the end of the tube abuts, the tube therefore extending axially beyond the first mentioned shoulder engaged by the O ring. The spring means conveniently comprises a spring washer, preferably having an annular surface extending continuously around the tube in a plane normal to the axis thereof, said surface arranged to bear against theO ring, the spring washer further having resilient arms extending from this surface to bear against the end surfaces of the collet arms. The following is a description of three embodiments of the invention, reference being made to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a longitudinal section through part of a tube coupling Figures 2 and 3 are respectively a side elevation and end elevation of an adjustable element used in the construction of Figure 1, these figures being drawn to a different scale from Figure 1 Figure 4 is a longitudinal section through part of another construction of tube coupling, and Figures 5 and 6 are longitudinal sections through part of further tube couplings. Referring to Figure 1, there is shown part of a tube coupling comprising a body member 10 having a bore 11 therethrough. A tube 12, shown in chain lines, is insertable into the coupling from the right hand end thereof as seen in the drawing to be gripped by a collet 13 which has a cylindrical portion 14 terminated at its outer end by a flange 15 and having resilient arms 16 extending axially inwardly into said body member 10 from the cylindrical portion 14, In the particular embodiment illustrated, there are six such arms and these are alternately short arms 17 and long arms 18. The arms each have a projection 19 in its inner surface, the projections 19 lying in a plane normal to the axis of the collet. These projections serve to grip the tube 12. The collet may be made of metal or of plastics material in the latter case, the projections 19 may be constituted by metal inserts. On their outer face, the collet arms 16 have a portion 20, the diameter of which increases in the axial direction into the coupling to form a tapered surface co operating with a tapered cam surface 21 on the body member 10 such that, if the collet is moved outwardly, that is to the right in the drawing, the collet arms 16 are forced radially inwardly to grip the tube 12. The tube 12 is inserted through the outer end of the collet, the right hand end in the drawing, to extend through the collet and to abut against a shoulder 25 formed in the coupling member 10. This shoulder forms a stop for the tube and is constituted by the end of an enlarged diameter portion 26 of the bore 11. The internal diameter of this portion of the body member is made just sufficient to accommodate the tube 12.The collet fits in a still larger diameter part 27 of the member 10, which part is terminated by a second shoulder 28 and a resilient O ring 29 is provided in the body member around the tube 12 adjacent the shoulder 28. An annular element 30 shown in further detail in Figures 2 and 3 having an external thread 31 engages an internal thread 32 in the body member so that, by rotation of this annular element 30, the O ring 29 can be compressed in the axial direction, Such axial compression serves to expand the O ring radially inwardly and outwardly.The O ring is made of a size such that it fits closely over the tube 12 and thus the axial compression serves to force the O ring into any irregularities in the tube and thereby to effect good sealing between the O ring and the tube. The axial compression serves to force the 0being against the shoulder 28 thereby sealing the O ring in the body member and also serves to improve the sealing against the surrounding cylindrical surface of the body member. To effect the required axial compression of the O ring, the annular element 30 has to be adjusted axially and this can be effected by rotation of the annular element 30 in the body member. FQr this purpose, the outer end of the element 30 is castellated to mate with the inner end of the collet, In the particular embodiment illustrated, the collet arms are alternately of longer and shorter length and the castellation comprises projecting portion 35 extending towards the shorter arms 17 and recesses 36 to accommodate the longer arms 18 of the collet, Thus rotation of the collet in the body member 10 enables the annular element to be adjusted in position axially. When a tube is to be released from a coupling, it is necessary to disengage the resilient arms 16 from the tube. For this purpose, the collet is moved axially inwardly into the body member 10 by pressing on the flange 15. The ends of the arms have sloping surfaces 38 which engage the surfaces of the annular element 30, the sloping faces 38 being arranged so that axial movement inwardly of the collet forces the collet arms radially outwardly. Figure 4 illustrates a modigicatiqn of the constructicri shown in Figure 1 and, in the following description, the same reference characters are used to indicate corresponding features. Reference will be made in the following description only to those features which differ from the construction of Figure 1. In Figure 4 the annular element 30, which is similar to that shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3, has an external thread 31 which, in the construction of Figure 4, engages an internal thread 40 in a support 42, for the O ring 43, which support is of generally cylindrical form and conveniently is made of moulded plastics material. This support 42 is located within a cylindrical bore in the body member 10, the bore in the body member in Figure 4 being larger than in the arrangement of Figure 1 in order to accommodate this support, The body member 10 has a radially extending key 44 to engage a co operating recess 45 in the support 42 to prevent rotation of the support in the body member.The support is sealed to the body member by means of an O ring 46 in an annular recess 47 around the outer surface of the support. The annular element 30 in this embodiment serves to compress the O ring 43 against a shoulder 48 formed in the support so thereby causing the O ring 43 to be brought into tight sealing engagement with the tube 12 and also to be sealed tightly against the shoulder 48 and surrounding cylindrical surface 49 of the support 42. The arrangement of Figure 4, compared with that ofFigure 1, has the advantage that, if the coupling is used for a tube carrying a high pressure fluid, any leakage of fluid around the end of the tube 12 will cause pressure to be built up on the inner end surface of the support 42 and will thus tend to force the support 42 outwardly in the axial direction thereby tending to move the collet outwardly and so thereby causing the collet arms to be forced more tightly into engagement with the tube 12.The sealing against the surface of the tube is effected as before with the O ring 43 whilst the O ring 46 provides the sealing between the support and the body member 10 This latter seal presents much less of a problem than the sealing against the tube because the support and body member have preformed surfaces which are defined in the construction of the coupling whereas the tube would in many cases, have irregularities on its surface, In the. construction of Figure 1, in which the compression ring runs in the housing, the collet can be released fairly easily under pressure. If, as inFigure 4, the compression ring runs in a sub assembly which exerts pressure on the collet when the tube is under pressure, it is harder to release the collet under pressure. In this case, it may sometimes be preferred to form a back stop in the housing. Such a construction is shown in Figure 5 which shows a construction similar toFigure 4 but with a back stop 148 which limits the outward movement of the collet. In Figure 5 the same reference characters are used as in Figure 4 for corresponding features and the construction and operation will be clear from the previous description. Referring to Figure 6, there is shown part of a tube coupling comprising a body member 50 having a bore 51 therethrough. A tube 52 shown in chain lines is insertable into the coupling from the right hand end thereof as seen in the drawing to be gripped by a collet 53 which has a cylindrical portion 54 terminated at its outer end by a flange 55 and resilient arms 56 extending axially inwardly into said body member from the cylindrical portion 55. In the particular embodiment illustrated, there are six such arms. These arms each have a projection 57 on their inner surface, the projection 57 lying in a plane normal to the axis of the collet. These projections serve to grip the tube 52. The collet may be made of metal or of plastics material in the latter case, the projections 57 may be constituted by metAl inserts. On their outer face, the collet arms 56 have a portion 59, the diameter of which increases in the axial direction into the coupling to form a tapered surface co operating with tapered surface 60 on the coupling member 50 such that, if the collet is moved outwardly, the collet arms are forced radially inwardly to grip the tube 52. The tube 52 is inserted through the outer end of the collet, the right hand end of the drawing, to extend through the collet and to abut against a shoulder 65 formed in the coupling member 50. This shoulder forming a stop for the tube is constituted by the end of an enlarged diameter portion 66 of the bore 51.The internal diameter of this portion of the coupling member is made just sufficient to accommodate the tube.The collet fits in a still larger diameter part 67 of the member 50 which part is terminated by a second shoulder 68 and a resilent O rng 69 is provided in the coupling member around the tube adjacent this shoulder 68. A spring washer 70 is provided between the O ring 69 and the inner ends of the collet arms to compress the O ring against the shoulder 68. This spring washer has an annular portion 71 lying in a plane generally normal to the axis of the tube and collet and bearing against the O ring 69. At its radially inner end, this portion 71 has integral spring portions 72 which extend radially and axially outwardly from the surface 71 to bear against the ends of the collet arms 56. The spring washer 70 is so dimensioned that, when the collet is put in position in the member 50, the spring is under compression so compressing the O ring 69 in the axial direction. The seal is thus forced against the shoulder 68 and iss also caused tp expand.inwardly against the surface of the tube 52 and outwardly against the enlarged bore portion 67 of the member 50.The spring washer 70 thus serves to deform the O ring 69 to give improved sealing between that O ring and the outer surface of the tube and between the O ring and the surfaces of the member 50. The resilience of the spring washer 70 permits of the forcing of the collet 53 inwardly into the member 50 when it is required to release a tube from the coupling, the collet arms 56 moving outwardly because of their own resilience and the ends of these arms riding smoothly over the rounded abutments constituted by the turned over edges of the aforementioned integral spring portions 72 of the washer. In the construction of Figure K, the spring 70 which exerts pressure on the O ring 69 may be inserted before a swaging operation on the body of the cpupling.Alternatively the internal diameter of the swaged body may be made larger than that illustrated so that the spring and O rina can be inserted after the body has been formed, e.g. swaged to the required shape. A collet of suitably larger size would then have to be employed. In yet another arrangement the spring is a split spring washer so that it can be introduced through the reduced diameter part of the body.
