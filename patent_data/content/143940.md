# Permanent disposal of radioactive particulate waste.

## Abstract
A system for the permanent storage and disposal of radioactive particulate waste in a cartridge composed of a liquid impervious casing enclosing a waste storage region provided with a ferromagnetic matrix made of steel wool, together with inlet and outlet conduits suitably associated with the waste storage region to enable a liquid containing such waste material to be conducted through the matrix while the particulate waste is adhered thereto under the influence of a magnetic field and the remaining liquid filtrate is expelled from the cartridge, and to then permit an encapsulating material, such as a resin catalyst mixture, to be introduced into the waste storage region to completely fill that region. The cartridge is temporarily connected by remotely controllable valves to conduits for permitting the liquid containing waste material to be introduced into the cartridge while the liquid component thereof is removed to a storage container, and the encapsulating material to be then introduced into the waste storage region, followed by direct insertion of the cartridge into a drum which can be subse quently sealed and permanently stored, all of this occurring in a fully mechanized and remote manner which avoids the exposure of any operating personnel to any significant radiation dose.
