# Method of forming an amorphous region in a crystalline metallic material.

## Abstract
A desired shape amorphous region is formed at a predet ermined position in a crystalline metallic material by introduc ing the desired shape of lattice defect at the predetermined position in the material and then irradiating the lattice defect with an electron beam to form the desired shape of amorph ous region at the predetermined position in the material.
