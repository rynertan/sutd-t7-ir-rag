# Preparation of tris beta hydroxypropyl isocyanurate.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a process for the preparation of tris β hydroxypropyl isocyanurate through reaction of propylene oxide with cyanuric acid. According to the invention the reaction is effected in a polyol, which is liquid under the process conditions and in which tris β hydroxypropyl isocyanurate is soluble or miscible, in the absence of a catalyst. Preferably a polyol is used which may be used in admixture with tris β hydroxypropyl isocyanurate in polyurethane synthesis. The advantages of the process are that the propoxylation does not proceed too far, and that there is no need to remove catalyst residues or solvent.
