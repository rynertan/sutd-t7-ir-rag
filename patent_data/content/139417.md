## Description
VACCINES BASED ON MEMBRANE BOUND PROTEINS AND PROCESS FOR MAKING THEM This invention relates to membrane bound proteins and derivatives thereof, and to vaccines obtained from them.Background Analysis of the immune response to a variety of infectious agents has been limited by the fact that it has often proved difficult to culture pathogens in quantities sufficient te permit the isolation of important cell surface antigens. The advent of molecular cloning has overcome some of these limitations by providing a means whereby gene products from pathogenie agents can be expressed in virtually unlimited quantities in a non pathogenic form. Surface antigens from such viruses as influenza 1 , foot and mouth disease , hepatitis 3 , vesicular stomatitis virus 4 , rabies 5 , and herpes simplex viruses 6 have now been expressed in E. coli and S. cerevisiae, and, in the future, promise to provide improved subunit vaccines.It is clear, however, that the expression of surface antigens in lower organisms is not entirely satisfactory in that potentially significant antigenic determinants may be lost by virtue of incomplete processing e.g., proteolysis, glycosylation or by denaturation during the purification of the cloned gene product. This is particularly true in the case of membrane proteins, which, because of hydrophobic transmembrane domains, tend to aggregate and become insoluble when expressed in E. coli. Cloned genes coding for membrane proteins can be expressed in mammalian cells where the host cell provides the factors necessary for proper processing, polypeptide folding, and incorporation into the cell membrane i,8 . While these studies show that membrane proteins can be expressed on the surface of a recombinant host cell, and, for example 8 , that a truncated membrane protein lacking the hydrophobic carboxy terminal domain can be slowly secreted from the host cell rather than be bound to it, it is not clear that either the membrane bound protein thus expressed or the truncated protein thus secreted will be able to act, in fact, to raise antibodies effective against the pathogen from which the protein is derived. Herpes Simplex Virus HSV is a large DNA virus which occurs in two related, but distinguishable, forms in human infections. At least four of the large number of virus encoded proteins have been found to be glycosylated and present on the surface of both the virion and the infected cells 9 . These glycoproteins, termed gA B, gC, gD, and gE, are found in both HSV type 1 HSV1 and HSV type 2 HSV2 , while in the case of HSV 2, an additional glycoprotein gF has been reported to be found 10 . Although their functions remain somewhat of a mystery, these glycoproteins are undoubtedly involved in virus attachment to cells, cell fusion, and a variety of host immunotogica7 responses to virus infection 11 .Although HSV 1 and HSV 2 show only 50 percent DNA sequence homology 12 , the glycoproteins appear to be, for the most part, type common. Thus, gA B, gD, and gE show a large number of type common antigenic determinants 13 16 , while gC, which was previously thought to be completely type specific 17,18 , has also been found to possess some type common determinants. Type specific antigenic determinants can, however, be demonstrated using monoclonal antibodies for some of the glycoproteins 10,19 , showing that some amino acid chongs have occurred since HSV1 and HSV2 aiveraeo. One of the most important glycoproteins with respect to virus neutralization is gD 11 . Considerable evidence has been adduced strongly suggesting that the respective gD proteins of HSV 1 andHSV 2 are related. For example, recombination mapping has localized the respective genes to colinear regions in both virus genomes.Amino acid analysis showed gross homology between the two proteins.The gD proteins induce neutralizing antibodies to both type 1 and type 2 viruses in 2 type common manner 19 21 . In addition, most monoclonal antibodies generated to these glycoproteins are type common, also suggesting a high degree of structural relatedness between the two types of glycoproteins 20 . Some monoclonal antibodies, however, were found to react type specifically, suggesting significant differences between the proteins 19 .Peptide maps of the proteins also unambiguously revealed such differences 22a . These results although suggesting that these polypeptides are related, are insufficient to indicate exactly how close the relationship is. In order to examine the nature of the type commonality of HSV 1 and HSV 2 gD proteins, the DNA sequences of the gD genes from HSV1 and HSV2 were determined. The derived amino acid sequences showed similarity. The resultant derived protein sequences were also analyzed for structural differences by using a program designed to determine hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions of the protein. This analysis demonstrated a high degree of conservation on a gross structural level. Although several amino substitutions were found between the two glycoproteins, the vast majority of these substitutions were conservative, suggesting an important structural requirement of this glycoprotein to the virus. In contrast to HSV 1, HSV 2 appears to encode yet another glycoprotein, termed gF 22b,10,22c,22d . Although the HSV 2 gF had an electrophoretic mobility which was much faster than HSV 1 gC, mapping studies with recombinant viruses revealed that this protein encoded by a region of the HSV 2 genome which was approximately colinear with the gene for HSV 1 gC 22c,22d . In addition, it has been recently demonstrated that a monoclonal antibody against HSV 2 gF will cross react weakly with HSV 1 gC 22f and that a polyclonal antiserum made against HSV 1 virion envelope proteins precipitated gF 22d , suggesting a possible structural homology between the two glycoproteins. Thus, it appeared that a possible homologue to HSV 1 gC was the HSV 2 gF protein. This relationship was investigated in accordance with the present invention. To examine the relatedness between HSV 1 and HSV 2, it has been determined herein that a DNA sequence of a 2.29 kb region of theHSV 2 genome is colinear with the HSV 1 gC gene. Translation of a large open reading frame in this region demonstrates that a protein which has significant homology to HSV 1 gC is encoded in this region. It is suggested that this region encodes the HSV 2 gF gene and that the gF protein is the HSV 2 homologue of HSV 1 glycoproteinC.Summary of the Invention One specific embodiment of the invention relates to a vaccine based on the gD protein. In the light of this information about the structure of the gD protein, as aescribed more fully herein, it was decided to express the gD protein DNA in mammalian cells to see whether such was possible, and if possible, whether the expressed protein would bind to the host cell membrane, and whether a truncated form of protein lacking the membrane binding domain would be secreted from the host cell, and in either of the latter cases whether the expression product proteins could raise antibodies effective against HSV 1 and or HSV 2. As the results herein demonstrate, these objects have been achieved. In particular, the invention provides using these proteins obtained by recombinant DNA processes as components in a vaccine effective against HSV 1 andHSV 2 viruses. Thus provided are protective vaccines against occurrence of herpes infection and of reduction in frequency and severity of herpes infection recurrence in individuals already infected. Another specific emboaiment relates to another class of glycoproteins obtained by recombinant DNA processes useful as components in a vaccine against HSV l and or HSV 2 viruses.Specifically, such glycoprotein class includes HSV l gC effective against HSV l , HSV 2 gF more properly referred to as an HSV 2 gC , effective against HSV 2, or combinations of the two proteins, effective against both viruses. Other such glycoproteins include gA, gB, and gE. It is believed that a vaccine based upon the combined gC and gD glycoproteins would be significantly more effective as a vaccine than either glycoprotein alone. To further summarize, the present invention involves a vaccine comprising a polypeptide with antigenic determinants capable of specifically raising complementary antibody against HSV 1 and HSV 2 viruses. In one embodiment, the polypeptide is functionally associated with the surface membrane of a recombinant host cell capable of its production. In a typical instance, such functional association comprises a binding of the polypeptide with the surface membrane so that the polypeptide projects through the membrane. The recombinant cell line is derived from a stable, continuous line. In another embodiment, the vaccine comprises a polypeptide with the same antigenic determinants, but which is not functionally associated with the surface membrane. As set out in more detail below, one such polypeptide is a truncated, membrane free derivative of a membrane bound polypeptide. The aerivative is formed by omission of a membrane binding aomain from the polypeptide, allowing it to be secreted from the recombinant host cell system in which it has been produced. In another embodiment, the polypeptide is formes first in functional association with a surface membrane and thereafter the polypeptide is dissolved, preferably in a non ionic surfactant, to free the polypeptide of the membrane. As used herein, the term recombinant refers to cells which have been transfected with vectors constructed using recombinant DNA technology and thus transformed with the capability of producing the polypeptide hereof. Functional association is meant being bound to the membrane, typically by projecting to both sides of the membrane, in such manner as to expose antigenic determinants folded in a native conformation recognizable by antibody elicited against the native pathogen. Membrane bound in reference to polypeptides hereof refers to a class of polypeptides ordinarily produced in eukaryotic cells and characterized by having a signal sequence which is believed to assist its secretion through various cell membranes as well as a membrane binding domain usually hydrophobic in nature and occurring at the C terminal end which is thought to preclude its complete secretion through the cell membrane. As such, it remains functionally associated or bound to the membrane. This invention is particularly directed to the exploitation of those membrane bound polypeptides associated with pathogenic organisms, e.g., herpes virus. As used herein, the terms HSV 2 gF , HSV 2 gC and gC 2 are used interchangeably to refer to a glycoprotein portion of HSV 2 which is highly homologous with HSV l gC and which is capable of raising sufficient antibodies to be useful as a vaccine. Once the antigenic determinants of the polypeptides of the present invention are provided by functional association with the surface membrane, thereafter, the membrane may be removed from the polypeptides without destroying the antigenic characteristics.Thus, for example, the membrane bound polypeptide may be removed from the membrane by solubilization with a suitable solution, preferably one containing a non ionic surfactant, to remove the oolypeptide from the membrane. An advantage of doing this is to isolate the polypeptide from extraneous cellular material, raising potential potency in its use in a vaccine. A technique for removing the membrane from the polypeptide is described below. In another embodiment, membrane free preparations may be obtained by creation of a secretion system. As described in more detail below, such secreted polypeptide possesses at least some of the antigenic sites necessary for antibody stimulation.

The viral DNA was isolated from infected cell cultures by proteinase K digestion and CsCl banding 23 . Cloning of the gD Genes of HSV1 and HSV2 Previous napping and cioning studies had localized the HSV1 aD gene to a 6.6 kb BamHI fragment 6,24 . HSV1 DNA was cleaved with BanE1, and the 6 7 kb region was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis. This fragment was ligated into BamHI digested pBR322, and the resultant mixture was used to transform E. coli strain 294 ATCC No. 31446 . The ampicillin resistant, tetracycline sensitive plasmids were screened for the proper HSV1 fragment by restriction enzyme digestion. The correct gD containing Sstl fragment was subcloned into Sstl digested plasmid pFM3 EuropeanPatent Application Publication No. 00686 3 5 January 1983 . Although the gD gene from HSV2 was previously mapped by recombination with HSV1, the exact location of this gene was unknown. Therefore, an 10 kb HindIlI fragment from the small unique region of the HSV2 aenome 4 was ligated into the Hindlil site of the bacteriophage lambda cloning vector 590 25 . In vitro packaged phage were plated at low density and screened by theBenton Davis proceaure with a 32P labeled subclone of the gD gene from HSV1 25 . Positively hybridizing plaques were grown, the DNA isolated, and the gD gene localized by Southern blotting and hybridizaton with the 32P labeled HSV1 gD gene 27 . The positively hybridizing, HSV2 gD containing fragments wre subcloned into the plasmid pUC9 28 . DNA Sequence Determination and Computer Analysis Various fragments from the HSV1 and HSV2 gD genes were subcloned into the ml3 phage vector mp9 29 , and were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide method of Sanger 30 . The nucleotiae sequences were analyzed using the HOM program 31 . The hydropathy of the deduced protein sequence was analyzed using a width of 12 and a jwnp of 1 31a .Cloning of the gD Regions from HSV1 and HSV2 Other studies had localized the HSV1 aD gene to the 6.5 kb BamHI J fragment according to the nomenclature of Roizman 6,12,24 .Isolation and sequencing of part of this fragment showed that this fragment contained the HSV1 gD gene. Since one might expect that the DNA sequences of the HSV1 gD gene would be relatively homologous to the HSV2 gD gene, this fragment was used as a probe for the isolation of the gD gene from the HSV2 genome. Since most of the genes from the HSV1 and HSV2 genomes appear to map colinearly 35 , the region from the small unique region of theHSV2 genome which corresponded to the HSV1 gD region the HindIII L fragment 12 , was cloned into a lambda phage vector. Screening of the resultant plaques with a 32P labeled HSV1 gD gene subclone revealed positively hybridizing plaques, suggesting that there was indeed nucleic acid sequence homology between the two virus genomes in this region. Isolation of the phage DNA and subsequent Southern blot analysis revealed the region of this fragment which corresponded to the gD gene. This region was subcloned for DNA sequence analysis.The Coding Regions Figure 1 illustrates the two gD DNA sequences compared with theHOM program 31 . Nucleotide number 1 is chosen as the A of the ATG initiator methionine. Gaps have been introduced by the HOM computer program to maximize the sequence homologies 31 . Nucleotide differences are shown by the symbol , while amino acid differences are shown boxed. Amino acid differences between theHSV1 gD sequence reported here, determined for the Hzt strain of qSV1, and that reported by Watson et al. 6 for the Patton strain, are depicted by the symbol . The start of HSV1 gD gene transcription, shown by an arrow, is from Watson et al. 32 .Possible linked glycosylation sites are shown shaded. Two possible TATA sequences are shown 5 to the start of gD transcription, while a third possible TATA sequence is shown 5 to 2 second open reading frame at the 3 end of the ESV2 sequence. Two regions of non coding sequence homology should be noted 5 to the gD genes and 5 to the second open reading frame from the HSV2 sequence. The Hydropathy of gD Proteins The hydropathy of each glycoprotein was analyzed using the program aeveloped by Hopp et al. lea . As sown in Figure 2, a hyarophobic transmembrane domain exists at the 3 end of the gene.Twelve amino acid long stretches were analyzed, and the average hydropathy was calculated. Residue differences between the two glycoproteins are shown, with conservative changes marked and non conservative changes marked . A HSV1 gD protein hydropathy,B HSV2 gD protein hydropathy. The DNA sequence analysis demonstrates that the HSV1 and HSV2 gD proteins are 80 percent homologous. The majority of the differences found between these two proteins were in the amino and carboxy terminal regions. The amino terminal region of these proteins contains a hignly hydrophobic region which contains an arginine residue near the amino terminal methionine. This hydrophobic domain is tile signal sequence which is characteristic of secreted an i membrane bound proteins and which presumably functions to direct at least a portion of the protein into the lumen of the enooplasmic reticulum 33 . A comparison of the first twenty amino terminal amino acids showed that there were a total of 12 differences between the type 1 and type 2 genes. Virtually all of the differences.however, are conservative since they encode other hydrophobic amino acids. The exceptions are the gly arg replacement at residue 3 and the arg gly replacement at residue 7. Although these replacements are not conservative, they do not change the net structure of the signal domain. Both genes maintain a positively charged residue within the first 10 amino acids. The hydropathy plot in Figure 2 revealed 2 hydrophilic carboxy terminal domain preceded by a hydrophobic region. This structure is characteristic of membrane bound glycoproteins and has been previously found in other viral surface antigens 5,34 . Its function is to anchor the protein in the cellular and viral memranes and, as such, performs an important role for virus infection. Twelve amino acid changes in this region of the gD proteins from residues 333 to 362 were found, most of which are conservative. This suggests that the only criterion for the amino acids in this region is that they be predominantly apolar in order to span the lipid bilayer.In addition, the region after the membrane domain residues 363 375 , which probably serves to anchor the protein in the membrane 33 , shows 5 changes in its first 13 residues followed by a long homologous stretch. This result suggests that the initial 10 15 residues in the carboxy terminal hyarophilic domain may only serve an anchoring function and therefore only need to be charged, while the subsequent 23 residues may serve some other function important to the gD protein specifically. Although many other amino acid changes are found throughout these two proteins, the vast majority of the changes are conservative. This fact is underlined by the structure revealed by the hydropathy program shown in Figure 2. As can be seen in this comparison, the two glycoproteins show very similar plots. The amino acid changes which are not conservative do not appear to change the hydropathy of the protein.Expression of the HSV 1 gD In order to establish a permanent membrane bound gD producing cell line, the gD containing fragment was ligated Figure 3 into a mammalian expression vector 36 containing the selectable marker, dihydrofolate reductase dhfr . Figure 3 shows a diagram of the plasmid, pgD dhfr, constructed for the expression of HSV 1 glycoprotein D. The expression plasmid consisted of the origin of replication ano the ss lactamase gene ampr derived from theE. coli plasmid pER322 37 , a cDNA insert encoding mouse dhfr 35,38 under control of the SV 40 early promoter and a 4.6 kbHindIII to BanHI fragment containing the gD gene also under control of the SV 40 early promoter. The HindIII end of this fragment lies 74 bp to the 5 side of the initiator methionine codon and includes the mRNA cap site. The HindIII site lies 250 bp to the 3 sia of the Goldberg Hogness box of the SV 40 promoter. The coding region of the gD containing fragment is 1179 bp long and adjoins a large 1.9 kb 3 region which contains at least part of the glycoproteinE gene 24, 32 , a translational stop codon, and a polyadenylaticn site. The plasmid pgD.dhfr was constructed as follows The 4.6 kilobase HindlIl Bam H1 fragment containing the entire gD coding sequence was isolated from the Bam H1 fragment cloned from the HSV 1 genome see above . The 2.8 kilobase HindIII Sal 1 fragment containing an SV40 oricin early promoter and the pBR322 ampicillin resistance gene and origin of DNA replication were isolated from the plasmid pEHEal 14. The 2.1 kilobase Sal 1 5am H1 fragment containing a murine dihydrofolate reductase cDNA clone under the control of a second SV40 origin early promoter was isolated from the plasmid pE348HBV E400D22 36 .These three fragments were ligated together in a triple ligation using T4 DNA ligase, and the resultant mixture was used to transform E. coli strain 294. The resultant colonies were grown and the plasmid DNA screened by digestion withSac 2. The correct DNA construction pga.dhfr Figure 3 was used for further transfection studies. The plasmid was introduced into Chinese Hamster Ovary cells CHO deficient in the production of dhfr 39 using a calcium phosphate precipitation method 40 . Colonies capable of growth in media lacking hypoxanthine, glycine, and thymidine were obtained and nine dhfr clones were analyzed. Of these, gD could be detected in five colonies using anti HSV 1 antiboaies in radioimmunoprecipitation and indirect immunofluorescence assays.One of the five lines gD12 was designated for further study. In oraer to characterize the cloned gD gene product, gD12 cells were metabolically labeled with 35S methionine or H glucosamine and analyzed by raaioimmunoprecipitation. The procedure used was as follows Cells were grown i10 Ham s F12 medium Gibco supplemented with 7 percent commercially dialyzed fetal bovine serum Gibco , penicillin 100 u ml , and streptomycin 100 uInl . When the cultures were approximately 80 percent confluent, the medium was removed, the cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline PBS , and labeling medium Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium containing either one tenth the normal concentration of methionine or glucose was added to a final concentration of 0.064 ml 1cm2 Either 35S methionine SJ.204, Amersham Int. 50 75 Ci ml or H glucosamine 100 Ci ml was added and the cells were grown for an additional 18 20 hr.After labeling, the medium was harvested and the cells were washed twice in PES, and removed from the culture dish by treatment with PBS containing 0.02 percent EDTA. The cells were then solubilized in lysis buffer consisting of PBS, 3 percent NP 40, 0.1 percent bovine serum albumin, 5x10 5 M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.017 TIU ml of apoprotinin and the resultant lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 x g.For immunoprecipitation reactions cell lysates were diluted 3 fold ith PBS and aliqouts typically 180 l were mixed with 2 5 ul of antisera and incubated at 4 C for 30 min. Immune complexes were then adsorbed to fixed S. aureus cells by the method of Kessler 40a and were precipitated by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 30 s. The S. aureus cells were then washed 3 times with wpsh buffer PBS, 1 percent NP 40, 0.3 percent sodium dodecyl sulfate , and the immune complexes were eluted with 20 pl of polyacrylamide gel sample buffer 62.5 mM Tris HCl buffer, pH 6.8 containing 10 percent glycerol, 5 percent 2 mercaptoethanol, 0.01 percent bromophenol blue at 90 C for 3 min.After centrifugation for 30 s the supernatants were applied to 10 percent polyacrylamide slab gels according to the method of Laemmli 45 . Figure 5A compares autoradiographs obtained with the gD12 cell line and HSV 1 infected cells control immunoprecipitation from the gD12 cell lysate with normal rabbit serum lane 1 immunoprecipitation of native gD grown in HEL cells lane 2 and A549 cells lane 3 with the conoclonal anti gD antibody, 55 S 41 immunoprecipitation of cloned gD from the gD12 cell lysate with polyclonal rabbit antibodies Dako Corp. to 0SSV 1 lane 4 , and the monoclonal antibody, 55 S lane 5 immunoprecipitation of cloned gD from the gD12 cells metabolically labeled with 3H glucosamine with polyclonal rabbit anti HSV l antibodies lane 6 . It is seen lanes 4 and 5 that a diffuse band of 59 60 kd was specifically precipitated from the gD12 cell line using either rabbit anti HSV l antibodies or the monoclonal anti gD antibody, 55 S, specific for the HSV 1 protein 41 . This molecular weight agrees well with that reported for gD isolated from HSV 1 infectedKB cells 42 . It is seen that the same monoclonal antibody precipitated proteins of similar but different molecular weights from HSV 1 infected human cell lines. The major product precipitated from the A549 human lung carcinoma cell line lane 2 was 53 kd and that precipitated from the human embryonic lung cell line HEL was 56 kd lane 3 . Previous studies 43 have shown that the molecular weight of HSV glycoproteins varies depending on the host cell and that these difference are due to differences in glycosylation.To determine whether the gD protein produced in CHO cells was, in fact, glycosylated, the cells were metabolically labeled with H glucosamine. Because bands of identical molecular weights lanes 5 and 6 were precipitated after metabolic labeling with 355 methionine or 3H glucosamine, e concluded that the gD protein produced in CHO cells is glycosylated. The human cell lines A549 ATCC CCL 185 and HEL 299 ATCC CCL 137 were grown to confluence in 3.5 cm tissue culture dishes and infected with HSV 1 at multiplicity of 10 pfu per cell. Virus infected cells were labeled by a method similar to that described byCohen et al. 44 . 4 hr after infection the medium was removed and the cells were washed once with fresh medium Dulbecco s modified Eacle s medium and once with phosphate buffered saline P3S .Fresh medium containing one tenth the normal concentration of methionine was then added to the cells along with 3S rethionine Amersham, International to a final concentration of 75 pCi per ml of medium. The cells were grown an additional 20 hr and then harvested by treatment of washed cells with PBS containing EDTA 0.02 percent . Viral proteins were solubilized in lysis buffer consisting of PBS, 3 percent NP 40, 1 percent bovine serum albumin, 5x10 5M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.017 TIUlml of apoprotinin. The resultant lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 x g in a microcentrifuge.For immunoprecipitation reactions the cell or virus lysates were diluted 3 fold wit phosphate buffered saline, mixed with 2 5 vl of the appropriate anti serum and incubated for 30 min at 4 C. Antibody antigen complexes were removed from the reaction medium by the addition of 25 l of a 10 percent solution fixed S. aureus Kessler 40a and were precipitated by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 30 s.TheS. aureus cells were then washed 3 times with wash buffer P8S , 1 percent NP 40, 0.3 percent sodium dodecyl sulfate , and the cells suspended in 20 pl of polyacrylamide gel sample buffer 10 percent glycerol, 5 percent 2 mercaptoethanol, 0.0625 M in pH 6.8 Tris buffer, 0.01 percent bromophenol blue and incubated at 90 C for 3 min. After centrifugation 12,000 x g for 30 s the supernatants were applied to 10 percent polyacrylamide slab gels 45 . To further explore the post translational processing of cloned gD, pulse chase studies were conducted. Figure 5B shows immunoprecipitation of cloned gD from gD 12 cells with rabbit anti HSV 1 antibodies Dako, Corp. at various times after pulse labeling with 35S methionine. Figure 5B shows a pulse labelling of the gD12 cells. In these studies, cells were grown to confluence in 10 cm tissue culture dishes and labeled with 35S methionine as described above with the exception that the labeling reaction was carried out for 15 min. on ice, the cells washed 3 times with fresh medium, and then returned to the incubator and incubated at 370C for various times. The reactions were terminated by washing the cells in cola phosphate buffered saline and solubilizing the cells as described above.Proteins were immunoprecipitated at the following times after pulse labeling lane 1, 5 min lane 2, 15 min lane 3, 30 min lane 4, 60 min lane 5, 120 min. The precursor form of gD with a molecular weight of 51 kd was specifically precipitated from the gD12 cell line 5 min after a pulse with 35S methionine, and this precursor chased into the higher molecular weight form 59 kd after approximately 60 min. From these studies we estimate the half time for this post translational event to be approximately 45 min. The precursor product relationship between the 51 kd band and 59 kd band closely resembles that reported for virus produced gD 14,42,46,47 and the kinetics of this process are similar to those described by Cohen et al. 42 .In virus infected cells the difference in molecular weights between the precursor and the product has been attributed to both N linked and O linked oligosaccharides 48 . To determine whether gD was exported to the cell surface, indirect immunofluorescence studies were conducted. In these studies rabbit, mouse, and human anti HSV antibodies were reacted with unfixed cells under conditions which do not permiablize the cell membrane 49 . gD12 cells and the parental CHO cells 1 1 ratio were plated onto glass coverslips 2.2 x 2.2 cm and grown until the cells were approximately 60 percent confluent Human serum known to contain antibodies to HSV 1 50 was diluted forty fold with phosphate buffered saline PBS and 100 l was pipetted onto washed cells and was incubated for 30 min. at room temperature in a humi dified chamber.The cells were immersed 3 times in PBS to wash away unbound antibody and then were incubated with 100 Xll of 20 fold diluted tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate labeled goat anti human IgG antibodies CappelLaboratories for an additional 30 min. The unbound labeled antibody was washed away with PBS and the cells were dehydrated in ice cold 50 percent ethanol ana 100 percent ethanol and rehydrated with glycerol on a microscope slide 49 . The cells were then viewed under phase contrast and fluorescence optics in fluorescence microscope Zeiss . Fig. 4 showS A, gD12 and CHO cells viewed visualized with phase contrast optics B, fluorescence image of the same cells as in A.Comparison of the phase contrast images with the fluorescence images showed that the gD12 cells were heavily labeled, while the parental CH0 cells bound little or no labeled antibody. In control experiments with normal mouse sera, normal rabbit sera, or human sera known to be negative for HSV antibodies, no specific labeling of the cells could be detected.These studies suggested that the gD was exported to the cell surface. Experiments with CHO and gD12 cells fixed prior to labeling with agents known to permiablize the cell membrane methanol or acetone gave a different labeling pattern. In these studies we observed heavy perinuclear labeling of the gD12 cells with anti HSV 1 antibodies, and no specific labeling of the CHO cells. In order to determine whether gD12 cells expressed antigenic determinants relevant to human HSV 1 and HSV 2 infections, the binding of antibodies from individuals known to possess anti HSV 1 or anti HSV 2 antibodies 50 was examined. Radioimmunoprecipitation of lysates from metabolically labeled gD12 cells gave results comparable to those obtained with rodent anti HSV sera Figure 5 . Similarly, human anti HSV 1 sera gave specific labeling of gD12 cells in an indirect immunofluorescence assay Figure 4 and did not label the parental CH0 cell line. Taken together, the results obtained with various rodent anti HSV 1 andHSV 2 antisera, monoclonal anti gD antibodies and human anti HSV antisera provide evidence that gD expressed on the surface of gD12 cells possesses a number of antigenic determinants in common with the native virus and that the structure of these determinants is not dependent on interactions with other HSV 1 proteins. The fact that one of the monoclonal antibodies tested 1 S is known to neutralizeHSV 1 in vitro 41 and in vivo 51 demonstrates that the gD produced in CHO cells possesses at least one of the neutralizing antigenic determinants in common with the native virus. In order to have a quantitative measure of the binding of anti HSV antibodies to gD12 cells, an enzyme linked immunosorbtion assay ELISA was developed 52 . In these studies gD12 cells andCHO cells were plated and chemically fixed into alternate wells of 96 well microtiter tissue culture plates. Various antisera known to possess antibodies to HSV were then serially diluted and allowed to react with the fixed cells. At the end of the assay, the absorbance in each well was measured and normal binding curves were constructed. The specific binding of antibodies to the gD12 cells was determined by subtracting the values obtained with the parentalCHO cells from those obtained from the gD12 cells. Specific binding by high titer sera could be detected at dilutions of 1 10,000. We compared serum titers determined using the gD12 cell ELISA assay with anti HSV 1 and anti HSV 2 titiers determined by conventional methods. Human sera previously titered 50 againstHSV by conventional assays, i.e., inhibition of hemagglutination ISO or complement fixation CF , was serially diluted into wells of microtiter plates containing either gD12 cells or the parentalCHO cell line and the binding of anti gD antibodies was monitored in an ELISA assay. gD12 cells and the parental CHO cells were seeded into alternate wells of 96 well microtiter tissue culture plates Falcon Labware and were grown to confluence in F12 medium GIBCO containing 10 percent fetal bovine serum. The cells were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline PBS and then were chemically fixed with 0.0625 percent glutaraldehyde in PBS.The cells were again washed three times with PBS and stored until needed at 4 in PBS containing 1 percent bovine serum albumin, 100 mM glycine 1 mM NaN3. To measure anti gD antibody titers, the cells were washed with PES, and serially diluted antisera was allowed to react with the fixed cells 50 lil final volume for 1 hr at room temperature. Unbound antibody was washed away and the cells wre incubated with 50 jl of 1 2000 diluted goat anti human IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase Tago, Inc. . The enzyme linked antibody was allowed to react for one hour at room temperature, and the cells were then washed three times with PBS.After incubation, the peroxidase substrate, o phenylene diamine, was added 200 Al and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2.5 M H2504 50 yl and the absorbance of the reaction medium from each well was determined with an automated plate reading spectrophotometer Titertek . In Figure 6, the serum represented by the open and closed circles exhibited aHSV 1 CF titer of 128 and HSV 1 and HSV 2 IHA titers of 4096. The serum represented by open and closed squares exhibited a HSV 1 CF titer of 8 and HSV 1 and HSV 2 IHA titers of 8. A, closed circle and closed square indicates binding to gD12 cells open circle and open square indicates binding to CHO cells.B, closed circle and closed square represents the specific binding to gD12 cells calculated by subtraction of the values in A. In Figure 6 it can be seen that a serum with a high anti HSV titer determined by conventional assays gave a high ELISA titer, while another serum with low anti HSV titers gave no detectable binding in the gD12ELISA. The studies described demonstrate that stable cell lines constitutively express on their surface a transfected gene product which binds with antibodies generated by herpes virus infection.Immunization of mice with gD12 cells. Twenty female BABBLE mice 5 weeks of age were obtained fromSimonsen Laboratories Gilroy, California . The mice were divided into two groups of 10 mice each an experimental group and a control group. Each mouse in the experimental group was injected with gD12 cells known to express HSV 1 glycoprotein 0 on their surface. Each mouse in the control group was injected with the parental Chinese hampster ovary cell line CHO cells from which the gD12 cell line was derived. For immunization of mice both types of cells were grown to confluence in 15 cm tissue culture dishes. TheCHO cells were grown in Hams F12 medium GIECO supplemented with 7 percent commercially dialyzed fetal bovine serum GIECO , penicillin 100 U ml , and streptomycin 100 U ml .The gD12 cells were grown in the same medium lacking glycine, hypoxanthine, and thymidine. To harvest the cells, each dish was washed twice with 15 ml of phosphate buffered saline PBS and then treated with 15 ml of PBS containing 0.02 percent EDTA. After 15 20 min. the cells were then removed from the dish and pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min. at full speed in a clinical centrifuge IEC model CL clinical centrifuge, rotor model 221 . The supernatant was discarded and the cells were resuspended in PBS to a final concentration of 1 ml PBS per each 15 cm dish of cells. Each mouse was then injected with 0.5 ml of cell suspension 5 x 106 cells distributed as follows 0.25 ml injected interperitoneally, and 0.25 ml injected subcutaneously in the loose skin of.the back of the neck.The mice were then boosted twice with fresh cells preparea as described above on day 38 and day 55 after the initial immunization. ice were bled via the tail vein on day 68 to obtain sera for in vitro neutralization studies. Mice were challenged with HSV 1 aclntyre strain on day 70. The virus challenge entailed an interperitoneal injection of 2 x 107 pfu of virus into each mouse. The mice were scored daily for mortality and every other day for weight change and the onset of paralysis. All of the mice in the control group died within 7 days of the virus challenge, while all of the experimental mice were protected and showed no sign of infection. These studies conclude that immunization with the gD12 cells protect from a lethalHSV 1 virus challenge. A variety of transfection schemes are possible, of course, using a variety of selectable markers. For example, mouse L cells can be usefully transfected using a mutant dhfr gene as a selectable marker. The gD gene was transfected into such cells via a vector harboring such a marker. In principle, the strategy which we have described could be applied to any situation where the expression of a membrane protein is desired. Expression of a Truncated Form of the gD Gene The foregoing description relates to the production of membrane bound gD protein. However, as discussed above in relation to Fig. 2, analysis of the amino acid sequences of the gD protein ofHSV 1 and HSV 2 identified in each case a hydrophobiclhydrophilic carboxy terminal membrane binding domain Figure 7 .A Schematic Diagram of the HSV 1 Glycoprotein D gD Hydrophobic shaded and hydrophilic market regions of the protein were determined from the hydropathy analysis 31a of the gD protein sequence derived from the gene sequence. Only those regions thought to be important for membrane localization and binding are shown. The functional domains are . a the signal sequence 33 , b the hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and c the charged membrane anchor. The three putative N linked glycosylation sites are shown by the letter G.The expression plasmid consisted of the pBR322 bacterial origin of replication and ampicillin resistance gene, a cDNA insert encoding the murine dihydrofolate reductase gene under the transcriptional control of the SV40 early promoter 53 and aHindIII Hinfl fragment which encodes the first 300 amino acids of gD under the transcriptional control of a second Sv40 early promoter.The HindIll site of this fragment lies 74 bp to the 5 side of the initiator methionine of the gD gene. The HindIII site of the SV 40 early region vector 36 lies 250 bp to the 3 side of the Goldberg Hogness box of the SV40 promoter. The Hinfl site blunted with Klenow DNA polymerase and 4 deoxynucleotide triphosphates is ligated to the Hpal site of the 3 nontranslated region of the hepatitis B virus surface antigen gene 36 . This method is also useful for preparing a truncated HSV 2 gene. The resultant sequence creates a stop codon TAA immediately after amino acid 300 of the gD gene. The transcription termination and polyadenylation sites for the truncated gD gene transcript are encoded by the 3 untranslated region of the hepatitis B s urface antigen gene 36 . The plasmid pgDtrunc.dhfr was constructed as follows The 2.9 kilobase gD containing Sac 1 fragment was isolated from the Bam H1 fragment cloned from the HSV 1 genome see above in the plasmid pFM3 see above cut with Sac 1. A 1.6 kilobase HindIII Bst Ni fragment containing the entire gD gene was subcloned intoHindIII Bst N1 digested pFM42 EPO Application No. 68693 . This plasmid was then cut with Hinf 1, blunted with Klenow DNA polymerase and four deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and then subsequently cut with HindlII. The 960 base pair HindIII blunt Hinf 1 fragment containing the truncated gD gene was isolated and ligated toHindIII Hpal digested pEHBall4. The resultant construction pgDCos trunc contained the truncated gD gene with the hepatitis B surface antigen gene at its 3 prime.end.A 2.3 kilobase HindIII Bam H1 fragment containing the truncated gD gene was isolated from pgDCos trunc. The 2.8 kilobase fragment containing the SV 40 origin early promoter and the pBR322 ampicillin resistance gene and bacterial origin of replication were isolated from the plasmid pEHBal 14. The 2.1 kilobase fragment containing the murine dihydrofolate reductase cDNA clone under the transcriptional control of a second SV 40 early promoter was isolated from the plasmid pE348HBVE400D22 36 . These three fragments were ligated together with T4 DNA ligase, and the resultant mixture was used two transformE. coli strain 294. Plasmid DNA from the resultant colonies was screened with Sac 2, and the correct construction pgDtrunc.dhfr Figure 8 was used for further transfection studies. Plasmid pEHBal 14 was constructed by cleaving pE342R1 described below , an SV40 hepatitis chimera, with XbaI, which cleaves once in the coding region of the HBV surface antigen, and sequentially removing sequences surrounding this Xba I site by using nuclease Bawl31. The plasmid was ligated in the presence of the synthetic oligonucleotide 5 AGCTGAATTC, which joins the HBV DNA with a Hindlil restriction site. Resulting plasmids were screened for an Eco Ri Hind III fragment of 150 b.p. pEHBal 14 was sequenced, which verified that a HindlIl site had been placed at a point just upstream of where the HBsAg initiation codon is normally found. This construction thus places a unique HindIII site suitable for cloning at a position where a highly expressed protein HBsAg initiates translation.Any putative signals necessary for high expression of a protein should be present on this 5 leader sequence, Plasmid pE342 which expresses HBV surface antigen also referred to as pHBs348 E has been described by Levinson et al, EPOPublication No. 0073656, March 9, 1983, which is incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, the origin of the Simian virus SV40 was isolated by digesting SV40 DNA with HindIII, and converting theHindIII ends to EcoRI ends by the addition of a converter AGCTGAATTC . This DNA was cut with PvuII, and RI linkers added.Following digestion with EcoRI, the 348 base pair fragment spanning the origin was isolated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroelution, and cloned in pBR322. Expression plasmid pHBs348 E was constructed by cloning the 1986 base pair fragment resulting from EcoRI and BglII digestion of HBV Animal Virus Genetics, Ch. 5 Acad. Press, N.Y. 1980 which spans the gene encoding HBsAg into the plasmid pML Lusky et al., Nature, 293 79 1981 at the EcoRI and BamHI sites. pML is a derivative of pBR322 which has a deletion eliminating sequences which are inhibitory to plasmid replication in monkey cells . The resulting plasmid pRI Bgl was then linearized with EcoRi, and the 348 base pair fragment representing the SV40 origin region was introduced into the EcoRI site of pRI Bgl. The origin fragment can insert in either orientation. Since this fragment encodes both the early and lateSV40 promoters in addition to the origin of replication, HBV genes could be expressed under the control of either promoter depending on this orientation pHBS348 E representing HBs expressed under control of the early promoter . pE342 is modified by partially digesting with Eco RI, filling in the cleaved site using Klenow DNA ploymerase I, and ligating the plasniid back together, thus removing the Eco RI site preceding the SV40 origin in pE342. The resulting plasmid is designated pE342R1. The resultant sequence creates a stop codon TAA immediately after amino acid 300 of the gD gene. The transcription termination and polyadenylation sites for the truncated gO gene transcript are encoded by the 3 untranslated region of the hepatitis B surface antigen gene 36 . The resulting vector was transfected 40 into a dhfr CHO cell line 39 , and a suitable clone gG10.2 selected which produced the truncated gD protein and secreted it into the surrounding medium. The protein was extracted from the medium and the cells were tested for immunogenic activity. Figure 9 shows the results of immunoprecipitations of intra and extra cellular 35S methionine labelled extracts. Radioimmunoprecipitation of cell associated and secreted forms of gD. Cells were grown in Ham s F12 medium Gibco supplemented with 7 percent commercially dialyzed fetal bovine serum Gibco , penicillin 100 u ml , and streptomycin 100 ulml . When the cultures were approximately 80 percent confluent, the medium was removed, the cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline PBS , and labeling medium Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium containing one tenth the normal concentration of methionine was added to a final concentration of 0.05 ml cm2. 35S methionine SJ.204, Amersham Int. was added to a final concentration of 50 75 uCi ml and the cells were grown for an additional 18 20 hr.After labeling, the medium was harvested and the cells were washed twice in PBS, and removed from the culture dish by treatment with PBS containing 0.02 percent EDTA. The cells were then solubilized in lysis buffer consisting of PBS, 3 percent 1tP 40, 0.1 percent bovine serum albumin, 5x10 5 M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.017 TIU nlll of apoprotinin and the resultant lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 x g. For immunoprecipitation reactions cell lysates were diluted 3 fold with P6S and aliqouts typically 180 pl were mixed with 2 5 pl of antisera and incubated at 4 C for 30 min.To immunoprecipitate the secreted form of gD, 500 ssl of conditioned medium was incubated with 2 pl of antisera for 30 min at 4 C. Immune complexes were then adsorbed to fixed S. aureus cells by the method of Kessler 40a and were precipitated by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 30 s.The S. aureus cells were then washed 3 times with wash buffer PBS, 1 percent NP 40, 0.3 percent sodium dodecyl sulfate , and the immune complexes were eluted with 20 pl of polyacrylamide gel sample buffer 62.5 mMTris HCl buffer, pH 6.8 containing 10 percent glycerol, 5 percent 2 mercaptoethanol, 0.01 percent bromophenol blue at 90 C for 3 min. After centrifugation for 30 s the supernatants were applied to 10 percent polyacrylamide slab gels according to the method ofLaemmli 45 . A, immunoprecipitation of full length membrane bound gO from the gD12 cell line. B, immunoprecipitation of the cell associated form of the truncated gD from lysates of two independently derived cell lines 1 and 2 .C, immunoprecipitation of the truncated gD from the culture supernatants of the two cell lines shown in B. , indicates control rabbit antiserum , indicates rabbit anti HSV 1 antiserum Dako Corp. . As can be seen, evident are an intracellular form of 35,000Daltons and a secreted and apparently glycosylated extracellular gO protein.Preparation of Truncated gD Used for Immunization gD10.2 cells were grown to confluence in polystyrene tissue culture roller bottles Corning 25140 in F12 medium supplemented with 7 percent commercially dialyzed fetal calf serum1 50 pgiml streptomycin, and 0.3 .9 glutamine. After reaching confluence the medium was removed and the cells were washed three times in the same medium lacking fetal calf serum and supplemented with 2 glml Hepes buffer serum free medium .The cells were then grown 3 4 days in serum free medium and the conditioned niediwn was then harvested and stored at 20 C. The medium was thawed at 37 C and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min. in a Sorvall GS 3 rotor. After centrifugation the pellet was discarded and the supernatant was concentrated in an ultrafiltration apparatus Amicon equipped with a York5 ultrafiltration membrane. The resultant preparation was concentrated approximately 150 fold relative to the starting material and contained approximately 8 m of protein per liter. The preparation was then dialyzed extensively against phosphate buffered saline PBS and used for immunization without further purification.Immunization of Mice Each 8 week old BALB c mouse was immunized with 36 .9 of protein contained in 200 iil of an emulsion consisting of 50 percent aqueous antigen and 50 percent complete Freund s adjuvant. Each mouse was immunized at multiple intradermal and subcutaneous site as follows 25 pl in each rear footpad, 50 l in the tail, and lc0 ul distributed among 3 5 intradermal sites along the back. Four weeks after the primary immunization the mice were boosted with 36 ug of the protein as above with the exception that the emulsion was prepared with incomplete Freund s adjuvant.For the booster immunization each mouse received 200 ul of the antigen emulsion distributed as follows 50 ul in the tail, 150 u1 distributed among 5 intradermal sites along the back. 19 days after boosting approximately 500 u1 of blood was collected from each mouse by tail bleeding. The sera obtained from this bleed was used for in vitro neutralization studies see below . 37 days after boosting the mice were used for virus challenge studies. Conrol mice matched to the experimentals with regard to age, sex and strain were immunized with human serum albumin 15 pg per mouse using the same protocol as it the experimentals. In Vitro Neutralization Sera from eleven mice iummunized with concentrated gD10.2 culture supernatant were tested for the ability to neutralize HSV 1 in vitro. Serially diluted mouse serum 2 fold dilutions 1 8 to 1 16384 were incubated with approximately 40 pfu of HSV 1 for 1 hr.at 37 C in Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium OMEM . After the serum incubation, each dilution was applied to approximately 40,000Vero cells contained in each well of a 96 well tissue culture plate. After 3 4 days virus growth was determined by staining each well with 0.5 percent crystal violet. Wells in which virus growth occurred showed no staining. Neutralization titers were calculated by determining the highest serum dilution which prevented virus induced cell death. All of the sera tested no10 from mice immunized with gD10.2 supernatant material showed HSV 1 neutralization activity range 1 16 to 1 512 and HSV 2 neutralization activity range 1 8 to 1 16 . Control mouse sera n 8 failed to provide any neutralization.Serum obtained from a mouse immunized with HSV 1 gave a neutralizating titer of 1 32.Virus Challenge Eleven mice immunized with concentrated gD10.2 supernatant and 13 control mice immunized with human serum albumin were challenged with 10,000,000 pfu of HSV 1 Maclntyre strain by intraperitoneal injection. 14 days after the injection of virus, none of the gD10.2 immunized mice showed any indication of viral inflection In the control group, 7 of the 13 mice were dead by day 14, 3 showed severe wasting and paralysis, and 3 looked healthy. Statistical analysis two tailed Fisher exact test revealed that the difference between the immunized and control groups was significant at the P 0.002 level. See Table 1 .

Mouse sera were tested for HSV1 and HSV2 neutralization activity 19 days after the second secretea gD booster vaccination. Serially diluted mouse sera 1 8 1 16384 were incubated with 40 forming units of HSV1 or HSV2 for 1 hour at 37 C. Each dilution was applied to 40,000 Vero cells contained in each well of 96 well microtitre wells. After 4 days, the cells were stained with 0.5 percent crystal violet. Neutralization titres were calculated by determining the hiqhest serum dilution which prevented virus growth. 2. Mice were challenged by intraperitoneal injection of 1x107 plaque forming units of HSV1 MacIntyre strain . Challenged mice were observed for a period of three weeks for HSV1 infection. 3. Each mouse was immunized with approximately 3 micrograms of secreted gD in a 50 percent aqueous, 50 percent Freunds adjuvant solution. Mice were immunized at multiple intradermal and subcutaneous sites. Four weeks after the primary immunization, mice were boosted. Mice were challenged 19 days after the booster immunization. Control mice were immunized with an equivalent amount of human serum albumin HSA . 4. Significant at p 0.002 level. It was found that the truncated protein released into the medium from gD10.2 cells was effective to protect mice from a lethal infection from HSV 1.Antigen Preparation for HSV 2 Virus Challenge Amplified gD10.2.2 cells, grown in the presence of 250 nM methotrexate, were seeded into roller culture bottles 850 cmê and were cultured in Ham s F12 medium GIBCO supplemented with 7 percent fetal bovine serum. After the cells reached confluence approximately 3 days , the culture medium was removed, the cells were washed three times in phosphate buffered saline PBS to remove serum proteins, and new serum free culture medium was added. The serum free medium consisted of Ham s F12 medium containing 25 nil Hepes buffer. The cells were then cultured for three days and the resultant conditioned medium was harvested and used for antigen preparation.Fresh serunsfree medium was then added to the cells and the ccle of harvesting conditioned medium at three cay intervals was repeated an additional one or two times until the cells died or no longer adhered to the culture surface. gD10.2.2 conditioned seruFfree medium was then filtered and centrifuged at low speed to remove cellular debris, and the resultant material was then concentrated ten to twenty fold with an ultrafiltration device us10 membrane, Amicon . The concentrated medium was then dialyzed overnight against PBS 3 changes of PBS, one liter per change . The resulting material was then assayed to determine the protein concentration and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to determine protein composition and to estimate the purity of the preparation.The material prepared by this process was then used to immunize animals against HSV 2 infection as described below.Immunization of Mice Against HSV 2 Infection Forty female BALTIC mice were obtained from the Charles RiverLaboratories Boston, MA and were immunized with the secreted gD protein gDtrunc or human serum albumin HSA at 12 weeks of age.For the primary immunization against the secreted gD protein, the antigen was adjusted to a concentration of approximately 70 ug per ml in phosphate buffered saline and was emulsified with an equal volume of complete Freund s adjuvant. Each mouse was then immunized with 200 ul of this emulsion distributed as follows 50 ul subcutaneously at a site approximately 1 cm from the base of the tail, 25 ul subcutaneously in each rear footpad, and 100 ul distributed among 3 5 intradermal sites along the back. The mice were then boosted with the same antigen one month after the primary immunization. For the booster immunization the antigen was prepared by the same procedure as with the primary immunization with the exception that incomplete Freund s adjuvant replaced completeFreund s adjuvant. For the booster immunization, 200 ul of antigen emulsion was injected into each mouse and was distributed as follows 50 u1 in the tail, 25 u1 subcutaneously in the loose skin above each thigh, and 100 ul distributed among 3 5 intradermal sites along the back. The control group of mice was in nunized according to the same protocol as the experimental group of mice with the exception that human serum albumin replaced the secreted gD protein as the immunogen.Serum was collected from the mice 24 days after boosting for use in in vitro neutralization studies.HSV 2 Virus Challenge Both experimental secreted gD injected and control HSA injected groups of mice were challenged by an intraperitoneal injection of HSV 2 MS strain 31 days after the booster immunization. Each mouse received 2 x 105 pfu of virus in 100 pl of Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium Dli EtI containing 10 percent fetal bovine serum. LD 50 experiments revealed that this amount of virus represented 100 500 times the amount of virus required to kill 50 percent of a population of normal. uninjected BALBIc mice. The virus injected mice were observed for a period of 3 weeks. All of the control mice HSA injected died within 9 days of the virus challenge.All of the mice vaccinated with the secreted gO protein survived the full three weeks and appeared normal i.e., they did not exhibit wasting or paralysis .

See text above for the details of the HSV 2 challenge. Truncated glycoprotein D was purified from culture medium conditioned by the growth of the gD10.2 cell line previously described. The culture medium was concentrated by ultrafiltration and truncated gD was purified by immuno affinity chromatography using an anti gD l monoclonal antibody coupled to Sepharose 4B.Truncated HSV 1 glycoprotein D gel was isolated from serum free medium conditioned by the growth of gD10.2 cells as previously described. The cell culture medium was concentrated by ultrafiltration using commerically available membranes AmiconCorp. and ammonium sulfate precipitation. gD l was then purified to near homogeneity by immunoaffinity chromatography. The immunoaffinity column was prepared by coupling a monoclonal antibody, produced against HSV 1 to cross linked sepharose Pharmacia Fine Chemicals and eluted by a method similar to that described by Axen, et. al. Nature 214 1302 1304 1967 .The major product in the medium of unfractionated culture medium conditioned by the gD10.2 cell line is the mature truncated form of gD l 43 46 kd and a precursor form of gD 38 40 kd . On average the gD protein represents 20 50 percent of the protein present in growth conditioned medium. Fractionation of this material by immuno affinity chromatography resulted in a considerable enrichment of gD. It can be seen that the eluted material is free Qf all contaminating proteins detectable by silver staining. To determine whether purification of the protein by this protocol denatured the protein or disrupted the antigenic structure of the molecule, antigenicity studies with a variety of monoclonal antibodies were conducted.In these studies we found that all antibodies tested except those reactive with the carboxy terminus reacted with the purified preparation. No difference in antibody binding behavior could be detected with the purified preparation relative to the material found in unfractionated culture supernatants. To determine whether the purified gD l protein could be used effectively as the basis of a subunit vaccine to protect from genital infection by HSV 2, guinea pigs were vaccinated with gD l formulated in various adjuvants. In the first studies, purified gD was incorporated in complete Freund s adjuvant and injected in intramuscular and subcutaneous sites of female Hartley guinea pigs.Female Hartley guinea pigs, 2 months of age and weighing approximately 250g were purchased from Charles River Laboratories Portage, MI . For studies using Freund s adjuvant, the primary immunization consisted of the injection of 30ug of gD l emulsified in 50 percent complete Freund s adjuvant distributed as follows 0.5ml injected subcutaneously into the loose skin above the neck, and 0.5 ml injected intramuscularly into the thigh. After 31 days, the animals were boosted with the same amount of antigen incorporated in incomplete Freund s adjuvant. Control animals were injected according to the same protocol as the experimentals with the exception that adjuvant alone was injected. Experimental and control animals were challenged by intravaginal infection with HSV 2 19 days after boosting.In studies using alum adjuvented gD l, 30ug of gD l incorporated in either alum phosphate or alum hydroxide 0.15 ml was used for both the primary and the booster immunizations. Alum adjuvented protein was injected by intramuscular injection into the hind legs. Animals were boosted 51 days after the primary immunization and challenged 27 days later with live virus. Each animal received one primary immunization containing 30 ug of purified protein incorporated in completeFreund s adjuvant, and one booster immunization 31 days later of the same amount of antigen incorporated in incomplete Freund s adjuvant. All animals were challenged by intravaginal innoculation of HSV 2 19 days after the booster immunization. Table 3 indicates the results obtained from these studies. It can be seen that animals vaccinated with gD produced high levels of antibodies capable of preventing both HSV 1 and HSV 2 virus infection in an in vitro virus neutralization assay. We found that the sera from these animals neutralized HSV 1 slightly more effectively than HSV 2.This result is reasonable in view of the fact that the immunogen was derived from HSV 1, and that there are known to be type specific antigenic determinants on gD 1 Eisenberg, R.J. et al., J. Virol. 35 428 1980 Pereira, L. et al., Infect. and Immun. 29 724 1980 Showalter, J.D. et al., Infect. and Immun. 34, 684 1981 . More impressive was the fact that all of the animals vaccinated with gD l were completely protected from the clinical manifestations of virus infection ie. redness, swelling, vesicle formation, ulceration, loss of urinary retention, and lethal encephalitis . Thirteen of the fourteen animals injected with adjuvant alone developed severe primary infections. There were numerous vesicles which typically coalesce to. form acute ulcerations. In contrast, animals vaccinated with gD 1 gave no indication of virus infection. These results clearly indicated that gD l incorporated in complete Freund s adjuvant can provide effective protection from genital HSV 2 infection. Because complete Freund s adiuvant is not acceptable for use in humans, we next wanted to determine whether gD l could provide protection from HSV 2 infection when formulated with an adjuvant suitable for human use. To this end, studies with alum precipitated protein complexes J.S. Garvey et al., in Methods in Immunology 1977 p. 185 17 were initiated. Table 3 compares results obtained using gD l incorporated in the adjuvants alum hydroxide.and alum phosphate. In control studies, animals were vaccinated with adjuvant alone. It can be seen that both of the alum based preparations elicited high levels of neutralizing antibodies against HSV 1, and that the neutralizing titers against HSV 1 were comparable to those elicited against gD l incorporated in completeFreund s adjuvant. However, the titers of antibody capable of neutralizing HSV 2 were significantly lower with gD l incorporated in either of the alum preparations than gD 1 incorporated in complete Freund s adjuvant. This result suggests that incorporation of gD 1 in alum results in the loss of one or more antigenic determinants common to HSV 1 and HSV 2, or that recognition of cross reactive antigens is more effective when the protein is incorporated in Freund s adjuvant.These results also suggest that alum hydroxide is a more effective adjuvant than alum phosphate since the neutralizing titers to HSV 1 and HSV 2 are significantly higher with the former than with the latter. Although the protection provided by the alum adjuvant preparations was less effective than that obtained with the Freund s adjuvant preparations, it was none the less significant. While a number of animals showed signs of virus infection, the severity of the infections was considerably less than that obtained in adjuvant alone injected control animals. Thus the mean lesion score was 0.9 in animals vaccinated with the alum phosphate vaccine formulation, and 0.t in the alum hydroxide based formulation as compared with a mean lesion score of 3.2 for the adjuvant injected control animals.According to the 4 scale used for scoring lesion severity, the reduction from a mean lesion score of 3.2 to 0.7 corresponds to a reduction in clinical symptoms from several large vesicles score of 3 to minor redness and swelling score of 0.5 . Interestingly, throughout these studies the average in vitro neutralization titer against HSV 2 correlated with the severity of clinical disease. The results described above demonstrate that the clinical manifestations of primary HSV 2 genital infection can be significantly reduced by vaccination with recombinant gave. The results obtained demonstrate that a single HSV 1 derived glycoprotein can provide complete protection from genital HSV 2 infection when administered in conjunction with a potent adjuvant.

Guinea pigs were judged to be sympotmatic exhibiting characteristics of virus infection or assymptomatic no signs of virus infection according to the 4 scoring system described byStanberry, L.R., et al., J. Infect. Dis. 146 397 1982 . In summary O, No abnormalitiers 1 , swelling and erythema 2 , a few smal vesicles 3 , several large vesicles 4 , several large ulcerated lesions. Mean lesion score was calculated by taking the arithmatic average of the maximum lesion score observed in the symptomatic animals in each group. The advantages of using the truncated protein for diagnostic and vaccine applications is that, being secreted into the extracellular medium, it is contaminated with far fewer proteins than would be found in a whole cell preparation. It will be noted that the present invention uses a permanent cell line to produce the protein. Upon transfection the vector is incorporated into the genome of the cell line and can produce the protein without cell lysis. The cell line can thus be used for continuous production of the protein, especially in the truncated form which is secreted from the cell. For example, the cells expressing truncated protein can be continuously used in a perfusion system by constantly removing antigen rich medium from the cells and replacing it with fresh medium. The particular cell line used here was a CHO line deficient in dhfr production, transfected with a vector containing a dhfr marker. By exposing the cell line to methotrexate Mtx under suitable conditions 54 the dhfr production and hence the linked gD protein production can be amplified. Three cell lines derived by transfection of the truncated gD gene into dhfr CHO cells were plated in parallel, labeled with 35S methionine, and immunoprecipitated as described in Figure 10. Lanes 1 and 2 indicate the amount of secreted gD immunoprecipitated from 500 ul of culture medium conditioned by two independently isolated cell lines before selection with methotrexate. Lane 3 indicates the amount of truncated gD imunoprecipitated from an equal volume of culture medium from a cell line gD10.2.2 selected for growth in 250 nM methotrexate. Rabbit anti HSV 1 antibodies Dako Corp. were used for the immunoprecipitations shown in lanes 1 3. Lane 4 represents a control immunoprecipitation of 500 iil of medium conditioned by the cud10.2.2 cell line with normal rabbit serum. To quantitate the relative amounts of truncated gD secreted into the culture medium by cell lines before and after selection in methotrexate, a competitive ELISA assay was performed. gD12 cells expressing a membrane bound form of gD were plated out and fixed with glutaraldehyde to the surface of 96 well microtiter plates as previously described. Conditioned medium from various cell lines known to produce the truncated gD was serially diluted across the microtiter plate and was incubated with a fixed quantity 2 pl of rabbit anti HSV 1 antibody Dako Corp for 1 hr at 20 C. Unbound antibody and soluble truncated gD antibody complexes were removed by washing each well 3 times with PBS.Horseradish peroxidase coupled to goat anti rabbit IgG was then reacted with the fixed cells for 1 hr at 20 C and unbound antibody was removed by washing 3 times withPBS. The colorometric substrate, OPD o phenylene diamine , was then added to each well and allowed to react with the bound horseradish peroxidase antibody complexes for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of sulfuric acid to a final concentration of 0.25 N. The absorbance of the OPD in each well was determined with the use of an automated microtiter plate scanner Titertek multiskan and dilution curves were plotted. The binding of anti HSV 1 antibodies to the parental CHO cell line was used to measure the extent of nonspecific binding at each dilution.The amount of truncated gD in each culture supernatant was inversely proportional to the amount of absorbance in each well.

Closed circle, binding of antiHSV 1 antibodies to gD12 cells in the presence of medium from gD10.2.2 cells selected for growth in 250 nM methotrexate. Open square, binding of anti HSV 1 antibodies to gD12 cells in the presence of 100 fold concentrated medium from unamplified cells secreting truncated gD.This procedure was carried out on the go10.2 cell line to produce an amplified cell line gD10.2.2 which was capable of growth in 250 nM Mtx and which secreted approximately 20 fold more truncated gD into the culture medium than the parental go10.2 cell line see Figures 10 and 11 . The dhfr markeriamplification system can be used with other cells which are able to acquire and stably incorporate foreign DNA. The success of this invention in demonstrating that a truncated form of a membrane bound protein, lacking that part of the hydrophobic hydrophilic carboxy terminal region responsible for binding it to the membrane, can yet be immunogenic indicates that similar results can be expected with other immunogenic membrane bound proteins, thus providing an improved source of vaccine against viruses, parasites and other pathogenic organisms. In the foregoing example, the DNA of gD protein was truncated at residue 300 because there was a convenient restriction site there.This had the result that the carboxy terminal hydrophobiclhydrophilic region was completely removed, as can be seen from the hydropathy plot of Figure 2 indeed an additional preceding region was removed from residue 301 to 332 without, apparently, destroying the immunogenic character of the protein. It would seem to follow, therefore, that with this protein, and probably with other immunogenic membrane bound proteins, the extent of truncation could be considerably less if desired, so long as it has the effect of removing the membrane binding character so that the protein is secreted into the surrounding medium.Example 2 Example 2 relates to an HSV 2 gC protein formerly designated a gF protein .Cells, Virus, and DNA Isolation HSV 2 strain G was grown on HEp 2 cells after infecting the cell culture at an input multiplicity of 0.1 for 3 days at 33 C inDulbecco s Modified Eagles Medium containing 10 percent fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. HSV 2 DNA was isolated by proteinase K digestion followed by CsCl ultracentrifugation as described 23 . DNA Manipulations Restriction enzymes, DNA polymerase thlenow fragment, T4 DNA ligase, and T4 polynucleotide kinase were purchased from BethesdaResearch Labs and were used according to the suppliers directions.Molecular Cloning of HSV 2 DNA Restriction Fragments The EcoR1 P fragment, which corresponds to approximate map position 0.650 of the HSV 2 genome, was isolated from EcoR1 digested HSV 2 DNA on 5 percent acrylamide gels. The isolated fragment was cloned into EcoR1 digested pUC9 28 . This plasmid was called pUC R1P. The pUC RlP subclone was then used to localize a Sacl fragment of the HSV 2 genome which contained the EcoR1 P fragment.Southern blot experiments 27 revealed that a 4.9 kb Sacl fragment of HSV 2 contained the EcoR1 P fragment. This fragment was isolated on 0.7 percent agarose gels and was cloned into a p8R322 derived plasmid which contained a unique Sacl site 55 .This plasmid was called pBRSacl E . Further restriction enzyme analysis of pBRSacl E demonstrated a 2.9 kb Sall fragment with sequences homologous to the EcoR1 P fragment which was subcloned into Sall digested pUC9 as described above. This plasmid was called p9C2Sal2 .9 . DNA Sequence Analysis of Cloned HSV 2 DNA The majority of DNA sequences were determined using the dideoxy nucleotide chain termination technique. Various fragments were subcloned into the replicative form of the m13 phage vectors mp7, mp8, and mp9, and the DNA sequence was determined as described previously 29 . In some cases, fragments were 32P labelled at their 5 ends with y32P ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and theDNA sequence of the fragment was determined by using the chemical degradation method 56 . Computer assisted analysis of DNA and protein sequence data was performed using the HOM program 57 . The hydropathy of the deduced amino acid sequences was analyzed using a width of 12 amino acids and a jump of 1 31a . Southern Blot Analysis of HSV 2 DNA Restriction endonuclease digested HSV 2 DNA and plasmid DNA were fractionated on 1.5 percent agarose gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose using standard procedures. The single stranded ends of the Sac2 fragment, marked with a star in Figure 12, were filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase 1, and the resultant blunt ended fragment was ligated to Smal digested m13mp7 replicative form 29 with T4 DNA ligase. The single stranded DNA prepared from this ligation and transfection was used as a template for the synthesis of 32P labeled single stranded probe DNA of high specific activity 1x109 cpm pg using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Hybridizations were performed using standard procedures 27 .ResultsMolecular Cloning of the gF Coding Region of the HSV 2 Genome The strategy adopted for the isolation of the gF gene of HSV 2 was based on the assumption that this gene was colinear with theHSV 1 gC gene. This assumption was supported by the recent finding that a 75,000 dalton glycoprotein, gF, with antigenic relatedness toHSV 1 glycoprotein C is found in HSV 2 and that the gene for this protein is approximately colinear with the HSV 1 gC gene 22d,59 .In addition, the isolation of a monoclonal antibody which binds to both HSV 1 gC and HSV 2 gF further suggested that these two proteins may be homologous to each other 22f . It was thus reasoned thatDNA sequence analysis of the HSV 2 genomic region which is colinear with the HSV 1 gC gene would result in the derivation of protein sequence information which would localize the HSV 2 gF gene. The 600 basepair EcoR1 P fragment of the HSV 2 genome has been shown to map at position 0.650 12 . This region is approximately colinear with the known coding region of the HSV 1 gC gene which maps between approximately 0.630 and 0.640 of the HSV 1 genome 59 . This fragment was isolated from an EcoR1 digest of HSV 2 DNA, cloned in the plasmid pUC9 28 , and its DNA sequence was determined 29,56 . Comparison of the resultant sequence with the HSV 1 gC sequence 59 revealed a remarkable degree of sequence homology between the EcoR1 P fragment and the 3 end of the HSV 1 gC coding region.Thus, the EcoR1 P fragment was subsequently used as a probe to isolate a Sacl restriction endonuclease fragment from HSV 2 genomic DNA that overlapped the EcoR1 P fragment sufficiently to include the remainder of the HSV 2 gene which was homologous to theHSV 1 gC gene. Figure 12 illustrates the steps taken to isolate a 2.9 kb Sall fragment from the HSV 2 genome which contained the EcoR1 P fragment and which was used for subsequent DNA sequence analysis.DNA Sequence Analysis of the EcoR1 P region of the HSV 2 Genome The 4.3 kb Sacl E fragment, which was isolated from the HSV 2 genome based upon its sequence homology to the EcoR1 P fragment, was further digested to give a 2.9 kb Sall fragment which was termed pgC2Sal2.9. Figure 12 illustrates the fragments from pgC2Sal2.9 which were subjected to DNA sequence analysis using either the dideoxy nucleotide sequencing procedure 29 or the chemical degradation procedure 56 . In addition, this figure shows the position of the EcoR1 P fragment within pgC2Sal2.9 as well as the position of a BglII site which corresponds to the right hand end of the BglII N fragment at position 0.628 of the HSV 2 genome 12 . Specifically, Figure 12 shows the cloning of pgC2Sal2.9, the HY R region which map s colinearly with HSV 1 gC. The region of theHSV 2 genome mapping from 0.61 0.66 was cloned as a Sacl fragment pBRSac E using the 600 basepair EcoR1 P fragment as a probe.A Sall subclone of pBRSac E , pgC2sal2.9, was used for DNA sequence analysis. Arrows refer to the sequenced regions , and the location of a major 479 amino acid open reading frame derived from the sequence is illustrated. Various restriction sites are illustrated, including the Eco R1 sites which delineate the EcoR1 P fragment, and the Bgl 2 site which is found at the right end of the Bgl2 N fragment map position 0.628 26 . The Sac2 fragment marked with a star was used in Southern blotting experiments to investigate the deletion which appears in this region see results . Other sites were used for DNA sequencing experiments.Sm Smal, Sa Sac2, Rs Rsal, Bg Bgl2, Pv Pvu2, R1 EcoR1. Figure 13 illustrates the DNA sequence obtained from pgC25ai2.9 compared with the DNA sequence of the HSV 1 gC region 59 . The HSV 1 gC region HSV 1 and the sequence obtained from p9C2Sal2.9 HSV 2 were compared using the HOM program 57 .Because various deletions were utilized to maximize sequence overlap, all positions, including spaces, have been numbered for clarity. Stars are placed over non matching nucleotides. The underlined A residue at position 43 of the HSV 1 sequence is the approximate transcriptional start site of the gC mRNA 59 . TATA 1 and TATA 2 are the probable transcriptional control regions for the HSV 1 gC mRNA and the 730 base mRNA, respectively 59,60 . The inserted T residue at position 1728 of the HSV 1 sequence was discovered by resequencing this region and was found to introduce an in phase stop codon at positions 1735 1737 which was homologous to the stop codon for the HSV 2 major open reading frame. The position of the 730 base mRNA initiation codon of HSV 1 is shown at position 2032 2034, as is the position of a second HSV 2 initiation codon at position 1975 1977. Referring again to Figure 13, the illustrated derived sequence of HSV 2 was compared with the DNA sequence of the gC gene region ofHSV 1 59 which showed an overall sequence homology between these two fragments was approximately 68 percent. However, certain regions of the sequence showed either a much higher or lower degree of sequence homology than others. For example, the sequences between positions 0 and 570 of the HSV 1 and HSV 2 sequences showed only 51 percent homology, while the region between position 570 and 1740 showed a much higher degree of sequence homology 80 percent .An additional highly homologous region 70 percent was also found at tne end of the two sequences from position 1975 to position 2419. In addition to the nucleotide sequence changes, the two genomes showed various deletions or insertions when compared to each other. The most notable was an 81 basepair region found at position 346 426 of the HSV 1 gC sequence which is missing from the HSV 2 genome. From this overall sequence comparison it appeared that there was a high degree of sequence homology between the HSV 1 gC region and the HSV 2 region sequenced here. Frink et al. 59 have found that the 5 end of the 2,520 base mRNA encoding HSV 1 gC maps to the underlined A residue at position 43 of Figure 13. In addition, they pointed out an AT rich TATA box 60 sequence approximately 22 basepairs 5 to this residue.Comparison of the two sequences shown in figure 13 shows that theHSV 1 and HSV 2 sequences both contained the identical sequence1CGGGTATAAA, in this region. This sequence is identical to that reported previously by Whitton et al. 61 , which is found to occur at the TATA box regions in many of the HSV 1 and HSV 2 sequences determined thus far. This conserved sequence is also followed by aG rich region in both virus genomes. In addition to this putative transcriptional control region, a second TATA box was found in both sequences at position 1845 1849 of Figure 13. This second TATA box has been hypothesized to control the transcription of a 730 base mRNA in the HSV 1 genome 59 . Both HSV 1 and HSV 2 contain this sequence surrounded by GC rich flanking sequences, including a CGGGCG sequence which is similar to the CGGG sequence preceding the first TATA box.In addition, both genomes encode open reading frames og to these second TATA boxes, which will be discussed below. In order to determine if the 81 basepair deletion described above was actually found in the HSV 2 genome or if it was an artifact of cloning or sequencing, Southern blot analysis of theHSV 2 genomic DNA and the cloned HSV 2 DNA was performed. A 32P labeled probe was prepared from a Sac2 fragment see fragment in Figure 12 which spans the region missing the 81 nucleotides. If the HSV 2 genomic DNA is missing the 81 basepair region, then a Sma1 Bglll fragment spanning this region will be 576 basepairs, aSmal fragment will be 662 basepairs, and a Sac2 fragment will be 195 basepairs. Figure 14 illustrates Southern blot analysis of HSV 2 genomicDNA and pgC2Sal2.9 DNA. The region spanning the 81 basepair region missing in the HSV 2 sequence shown in Figure 13 HSV 2 positions 346 426 was analyzed using the Sac2 fragment marked with a star in Figure 12 which overlaps the deleted region. Lanes 1 3 are restriction digests of HSV 2 genomic DNA, and lanes 4 6 are restriction enzyme digests of pgC2sal2.9. The digested DNAs were electrophoresed on 1.5 percent agarose gels, denatured, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with the 32P labeled Sac2 fragment. The arrow shows the position of the 564 base pair HindIII fragment of phage X DNA. Lanes 1,6 Smal Bgl2 lanes 2,5 Smal Lanes 3,4 Sac2. The results shown in Figure 14 demonstrate that the predicted restriction sites surrounded the region missing the 81 basepairs in both the HSV 2 genomic DNA and the cloned HSV 2 DNA. In addition, the HSV 2 genomic fragments and the cloned fragments emigrated exactly, demonstrating that the deletion is not an artifact of cloning or sequencing.Analysis of the Major Open Reading Frame Within the HSV 2 2.9 kbSall Fragment Analysis of the potential coding sequences within the 2.9 kbSall DNA fragment of HSV 2 revealed an open reading frame of 479 amino acids which began with the methionine encoded at position 199 201 of the HSV 2 sequence shown in Figure 13 and ended at theTAA termination codon at position 1735 1737 of the HSV 2 sequence in this figure. As can be seen from Figure 13, both the HSV 1 gC protein and the HSV 2 open reading frame initiate at approximately the same position in the two sequences, relative to the TATA box homologies.In addition, while it initially appeared that the HSV 2 open reading frame found in this region terminated 12 codons before the HSV 1 gC gene, resequencing of the carboxy terminal region of the gC gene sequence of HSV 1 strain F revealed that the sequence reported by Frink et al. 59 was missing a thymidine nucleotide after position 1727 and that insertion of this residue resulted in a translated HSV 1 gC protein terminating at the same place as the HSV 2 open reading frame 1735 1737 ofFigure 13 . Thus, when taking the various deletions and insertions into account, as illustrated in Figure 13, the HSV 1 gC gene and theHSV 2 open reading frame show a very high degree of overlap. Figure 15 illustrates translation of the HSV 2 large open reading frame and comparison with the HSV 1 gC amino acid sequence.The single letter amino acid symbols were used. HSV 1 gC refers to the HSV 1 gC sequence, and HSV 2 gF refers to the HSV 2 open reading frame sequence. The proteins were compared using the HOM program, which maximized homologies by inserting gaps where necessary 57 .Stars are placed over non homologous amino acids. Putative N linked glycosylation sites NXS or NXT 62 are shaded, and cysteine residues C are boxed. Only amino acids, and not spaces are numbered. Also shown are translation of the second HSV 2 open reading frame and comparison with the HSV 1 730 base niNA protein. 730 QRF HSV 2 is the incomplete amino acid sequence of the second HSV 2 open reading frame from positions 1975 2406 of the HSV 2 sequence shown in Figure 13. 730 ORF HSV 1 is the amino acid sequence derived for the protein encoded by the 730 base mRNA ofHSV 1 59 . Conserved amino acid changes, with respect to charge, are marked C and nonconserved changes, with respect to charge, are marked N in Figure 15. Figure 15 illustrates the high degree of sequence homology between the HSV 1 gC gene and the 479 amino acid HSV 2 open reading frame. The first 19 amino acids contain approximately 80 percent sequence homology with the changes in the first 25 amino acids being all conservative with respect to charge. From residue 124 of HSV 1 gC residue 90 of the HSV 2 sequence to the end of both proteins there is about 74 percent sequence homology with 75 percent of the amino acid changes being conservative with respect to charge. Five putative N linked glycosylation sites NXS or NXT 62 are conserved between the two proteins, and all 7 cysteine residues are located in homologous positions relative to the C terminus.In addition to the overall conservation of sequences in the carboxy terminal three fourths of the proteins, there are also large regions of contiguous amino acid sequence homology up to 20 residues in length i.e., position 385 405 of the HSV 1 sequence and 352 372 of the HSV 2 sequence . It may be concluded from this sequence comparison that the open reading frame in this region of the HSV 2 genome encodes a protein which is homologous to HSV 1 gC. While the HSV 2 protein encoded in this region shows a remarkable degree of sequence homology to the HSV 1 gC sequence, there are several notable differences between the two sequences.The most striking difference is a deletion of 27 amino acids in theHSV 2 sequence which are found in the HSV 1 gC sequence from residues 50 76 Figure 15 and which corresponds to the 81 basepair deletion described above. In addition to this large deletion, both sequences show minor deletions of one or two amino acids. All of these deletions are found in the amino terminal regions of the proteins. In addition to these deletions, there are a large number df amino acid changes in the amino terminal region of the proteins which are clustered between residues 29 123 of the HSV 1 gC sequence residues 31 90 of the HSV 2 sequence . Only 30 percent of the amino acids in this region are homologous, with much of this homology due to conserved proline residues. 43 percent of the amino acid substitutions found in this region are non conservative with respect to charge.The only other regions which showed such a large number of changes are a carboxy terminal hydrophobic domain residues 476 496 of the HSV 1 sequence and 443 463 of the HSV 2 sequence where the proteins are 55 percent homologous but where all the changes are conserved, uncharged, hydrophobic amino acids and the carboxy termini of the proteins where the sequences are only 25 percent homologous, but where the overall amino acid composition is similar residues 500 512 of the HSV 1 sequence and 467 479 of theHSV 2 sequence . While five of the putative N linked glycosylation sites are conserved between the two proteins, the HSV 1 gC sequence contains two more sites than the HSV 2 sequence 9 versus 7 total .The HSV 1 gC sequence contains 2 N linked glycosylation sites in the 27 amino acids deleted from the HSV 2 sequence, and an overlapping pair of sites between residues 109 and 112 of Figure 15. The HSV 2 sequence contains two N linked glycosylation sites not found in theHSV 1 sequence, one of which is proximal to the amino terminus. In order tomore fully examine the possible structtiral homologies between the HSV 1 and HSV 2 sequences, hydropathy analysis was performed 31a . Figure 16 illustrates hydropathy analysis of the HSV 1 gC protein and the HSV 2 major open reading frame protein. The hydropathy of each protein was determined using the program of Hopp and Woods 31a . Hydrophobic regions are above the midline and hydrophilic regions are below the midline.Stretches of 12 amino acids were analyzed, and the average hydropathy was calculated. Putative atparagine linked glycosylation sites 62 are marked 0 gC 1 HSV 1 gC protein hydropathy.gC 2 gF HSV 2 major open reading frame protein hydropathy. Figure 16 shows that both proteins exhibited an extraordinary degree of structural homology based on the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of the amino acid sequences. Each show anN terminal hydrophobic domain followed by a stretch of hydrophilic amino acids which contain either 6 of 9 total HSV 1 or 3 of 7 total HSV 2 putative N linked glycosylation sites. The peaks and valleys which follow this hydrophilic region are very similar in both proteins, including the hydrophilic domain containing the finalN linked glycosylation site. The carboxy termini of both proteins shows a very hydrophobic 20 residue region followed by a hydrophilic carboxy terminus. The 27 contiguous amino acids found exclusively in the HSV 1 gC protein appear to encode a relatively hydrophilic region between residues 50 76 Figure 16 .In conclusion, this analysis reveals that the hydropathic features of both the HSV 1 gC and the HSV 2 protein are very similar and that the least conserved amino terminal regions of the proteins are found in hydrophilic regions which have the potential to be highly glycosylated.Analysis of the Second HSV 2 Open Reading Frame Translation of the final 431 basepairs of the HSV 2 sequence shown in figurel3 residues 1975 2406 revealed a second open reading frame of 105 amino acids. Although the sequence information reported here is insufficient to contain the entire HSV 2 second open reading frame, comparison of this sequence with the open reading frame encoded by the 730 base mRNA of HSV 1 reported byFrink et al. 10 also revealed a high degree of sequence homology.As can be seen jin figure 15, the two sequences showed 75 percent sequence homology in the overlapping regions, with about 90 percent of the amino acid changes being conservative with respect to charge. The major difference between the two sequences was a 19 amino acid N terminal region which was found in the HSV 2, but notHSV 1 sequence. Thus, although the function of the protein encoded in this region is unknown, the proteins from HSV 1 and HSV 2 show a considerable degree of sequence homology.Discussion The above results demonstrate that the HSV 2 genome encodes a colinearly mapping homologue of the HSV 1 glycoprotein C. The colinearity of the sequences found here is strengthened by the finding of a sequence 3t of the HSV 2 major open reading frame which apparently encodes a homologue of the HSV 1 730 base pair mRNA 10 . Previous mapping of the HSV 2 gF gene 33 , together with the properties described here for the major open reading frame in this region of the HSV 2 genome including several potential N linked glycosylation sites and an apparent amino terminal signal sequence 5 as well as a putative carboxy terminal transmembrane domain 28 allow the conclusion that the HSV 2 protein described here is the glycoprotein, gF.In addition, the size of the translated HSV 2 protein 52,000 daltons is similar to that reported for the endoglycosidase H treated, native size for HSV 2 gF 54,000 daltons 22d . Finally, the large extent of amino acid sequence homology as well as the conservation of several potential N linked glycosylation sites and of all 7 cysteine residues indicates structural homology between HSV 1 gC and HSV 2 gF. These results, then, strongly suggest that the HSV 1 gC protein and the HSV 2 gF protein are homologous to each other. These results help explain previous results which demonstrated that the HSV 2 gF and HSV 1 gC proteins were mainly type specific, but that they did have type common determinants 17,22d,22f,43 .Since several previous studies 17,18,43 demonstrated that these proteins induced predominantly type specific antibodies, it is reasonable that the most antigenic regions of the proteins are found within the more divergent N terminal sequences which follow the putative hydrophobic signal sequences. The hydrophilic nature of the divergent regions, along with their high content of potentialN linked glycosylation sites 62 , suggests that these regions would be located on the surface of the protein. Exposure of these divergent sequences to the outside of the proteins may be responsible for the generation of type specific antibodies directed against these divergent epitopes. However, type common antibodies could likely also be generated by the more highly conserved carboxy terminal three fourths of the proteins, since hydrophilic regions conserved between gC and gF could be exposed to the outside of the proteins and may be, in one case, glycosylated residues 363 366 of HSV 1 gC and 330 332 of HSV 2 gF . Thus, HSV 1 gC andHSV 2 gF share both type specific and type common determinants, but it appears that the type specific determinants are more antigenic. Although an explanation of the type specific and type common determinants of gC and gF is not known, it is possible that the proteins have at least two functions, one of which is important for the viability of both viruses, the type common domain, and one of which is specific for each virus type, the type specific domain.While the function s of gC and gF is at present unknown, and while viable gC minus mutants of HSV 1 have been isolated in vitro 65 , it is not clear that either gC or gF are indispensable to the viruses during in vivo infection of the human host and the establishment of latency. It is possible that at least some of the biological differences between HSV 1 and HSV 2, including predilection for site of infection and virulence, may be due to the marked structural differences between the amino terminal regions of gC and gF. It may be concluded, even in the absence of any functional knowledge of these proteins, that different selective pressures must be operating on the divergent and conserved domains of gC and gF. Previous sequence comparison of the gD genes of HSV 1 and HSV 2 58 demonstrated that the amino terminal signal sequence 63 and the carboxy terminal transmembrane domain 64 were able to tolerate a large number of mutations as long as the substituted amino acids were hydrophobic. The gC and gF sequence comparison demonstrates a similar finding in the carboxy terminal, putative transmembrane domain 64 from residues 476 496 of gC and 443 463 of gF. The large number of heterologous hydrophobic substitutions in this region suggests that, as in gD, any amino acid which is lipid soluble can be tolerated in this region. In contrast to gD, however, the amino terminal signal sequences of gC and gF are highly homologous in the first 19 residues.Thus, either this region has an important conserved function other than direction of the glycoproteins into the rough endoplasmic reticulum 5 , or there may be an overlapping gene or other functional sequence in this region of the genome which must be conserved 66 . Although insufficient HSV 2 sequence is presented here for a complete comparison, the region 5 to the start of HSV 1 gC mRNA transcription shows an identical CGGGTATAA sequence in both theHSV 1 and HSV 2 genomes. In addition, both sequences are followed by a G rich region immediately preceding the start of transcription. Thus, as was previously found for the gD genes ofHSV 1 and HSV 2, upstream sequence homologies exist between the two virus types which suggest the possibility that these regions are involved in transcriptional regulation of these genes.Interestingly, the second TATA box homology found in both virus genomes, which probably controls transcription of the 730 base mRNA 59,60 , also shows a relatively high degree of sequence homology inHSV 1 and HSV 2. These TATA boxes are preceded by CG rich sequences, which are similar, but not identical, to those preceding the first TATA 1 regions shown in Figure 13, and they are both followed by a 14 basepair region showing 80 percent sequence homology. The entire region of homology surrounding this region is only 33 basepairs with an overall sequence homology of 75 percent.If this region is involved in transcriptional regulation of the 730 base mRNA, then it appears that a relatively short sequence may be sufficient for recognition by transcriptional regulatory elements. The results demonstrate that the HSV 1 gC and HSV 2 gF glycoproteins are highly homologous, and that they encode type common and type specific domains. Since the two proteins do show significant sequence homology, and since they apparently map colinearly, we favor the proposal of Zezulak and Spear 22d to rename HSV 2 gF as HSV 2 gC or gC 2. In addition, the sequencing data reported here opens the way for a functional analysis of the gC 1 and gC 2 proteins by the interchange of various type specific regions between the two proteins in vitro and expression of the chimaeric sequences in mammalian cells 67 or by reincorporation of these regions back into the virus 6S . It is believed that the cloned gC 2 glycoproteins may be expressed and formed into a vaccine in a manner analogous to that set forth in Example 1. It is further believed that a vaccine which includes a mixture of such recombinant gC and gD glycoproteins would be significantly more effective as a vaccine against HSV l and HSV 2 than one based upon either glycoprotein alone.
