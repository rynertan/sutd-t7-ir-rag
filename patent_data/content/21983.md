# Method of and apparatus for accelerating a solid mass.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for accelerating an axi symetrical mass, such as a projectile, 50 by imploding a plasma discharge against the projectile surface, the plasma inducing an ionized liquid layer, and a magnetic field from the plasma interacting with the ionized liquid layer to accelerate the projectile. In a preferred embodiment the projectile is tapered toward its axis in a direction opposite from the direction of acceleration. To provide a long acceleration path a plurality of cascaded accelerating sections 51 55 are provided along the path and the projectile position, as it advances between the sections, is sensed and discharges are switched on sequentially in the sections.
