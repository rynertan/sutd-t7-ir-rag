# Moving bed radial flow solids fluid contacting apparatus.

## Abstract
The invention concerns an improved radial flow solids fluid contacting apparatus 1 in which radial flow of fluid liquid or gas coacts with downward flow of the solids in particle form. The invention concerns the design and placement of particle collection scoops 8 close to the bottom of the bed 4 of particles to eliminate stagnant particle zones by improving the conditions under which particles are withdrawn from the bed. The invention has particular application to a catalytic reactor and an array of arcuate funnel shaped scoops surrounding the central pipe of such a reactor is preferred. Preferred shapes and angles of inclination to the horizontal for the scoops are disclosed.
