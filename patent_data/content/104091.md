# Self testing system for reproduction machine.

## Abstract
A reproduction machine incorporating self test routines to test the machine operating logic, particularly at start up, to insure the integrity and operability of the component parts of the operating logic. The tests include routines for initially checking the logic and memory of the machine master control module 19 . A display panel on the master control module visually identifies any fault in the event the com munication link to the machine main display 7 has failed. Once the operability of the master control module 19 is established, self tests of the various machine remote control modules 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 are carried out followed by a test of the communication channel 25 between all modules. Any fault found is visually identified to facilitate repair and servicing.
