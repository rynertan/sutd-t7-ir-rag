# A DRY CELL BATTERY RE ACTIVATOR

## Abstract
A dry cell battery re activator comprising means for producing uni directional pulses and inductive coupling means whereby the pulses are applied to a closed circuit comprising an inductive element and a battery to be re activated. The battery to be re activated has characteris tics similar to a leaky capacitor and therefore it forms with the inductive element a heavily damped resonant circuit. Thus each time a pulse is induced in the inductive element damped oscillations occur in the resonant circuit including the battery.
