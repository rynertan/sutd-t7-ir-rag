# Nickel palladium chromium boron brazing alloy.

## Abstract
An improved brazing alloy, particularly suited for use in high temperature gas turbine engines, has a composition range which exhibits X ray inspection capability, improved stress rupture properties, good ductility and oxidation resis tance up to 760 C. The brazing alloy consists essentially of, by weight, about 20 80 Pd, 2 13 Cr, 1 4 B, balance being Ni and incidental impurities. The brazing alloy is capable of brazing in the 982 C 1093 C temperature range and is less costly than Au bearing brazing alloys currently in use for brazing in this temperature range.
