## Description
Process for Producing 15ethyl Methoxyacetate The present invention relates to a process for producing methyl methoxyacetate, and, more particularly, to a process for producing methyl methoxyacetate selectively from formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, and methanol. ethyl methoxyacetate is converted into ethylene glycol when hydrogenated and hydrolyzed. Therefore, it is a precursor for the production of ethylene glycol, and it is also useful 25 an organic solvent. According to the prevailing industrial process, the production of ethylene glycol from formaldehyde is accomplished by the steps of reacting formaldehyde and carbon monoxide in the presence of sulfuric acid catalyst to form glycolic acid, esterilying the glycolic acid with methanol to form methyl glycoate, and hydrogenating the methyl glycolate to form ethylene glycol. In this process, the production of the intermediate glycolic acid is carried out at a high temperature under a high pressure, e.g., 2000C and 700 atmospheres.The reaction under such severe conditions in the presence of a corrosive acid requires an expensive apparatus made of corrosion resistant materials, and consumes a great deal of energy for the generation of high temperature and high pressure. In addition, the production of ethylene glycol from formaldehyde involves many complex reaction steps. Heretofore, several attempts have been made to solve the above mentioned problems involved in producing the intermediate for ethylene glycol from formaldehyde. There are disclosed, for instance, a process for producing glycolic acid by reacting formaldehyde and carbon monoxide at a lower temperature and pressure in the presence of hydrogen fluoride catalyst Japanese Patent lsaid open Nos. 13719 1976 and 103135 1981 a process for producing glycolic acid by reacting formaldehyde and carbon monoxide in the presence of a catalyst based on a Cu I or Ag compound in concentrated sulfuric acid JapanesePatent Laid open No. 41327 1976 and a process for reacting formaldehyde and carbon monoxide in sulfuric acid orBF3 H20 in the presence of a copper I or silver carbonyl compound and then adding methanol, thereby producing an ester of glycolic acid Shokubai , 23 1 , 48 1981 . Unlike conventional processes, these reactions permit the production of glycolic acid from formaldehyde and carbon monoxide, without requiring high temperature and high pressure. However, they have some disadvantages. That is, in the case where concentrated sulfuric acid is used, the viscosity is so high that sufficient stirring is difficult and the solubility of carbon monoxide in the reaction system limits the reaction rate. In the case where BF3 H20 is used, it is comparatively unstable and tends to release BF3 gas. In the case where a hydrogen fluoride catalyst is used, an extremely expensive apparatus is required due to the high corrosiveness of the catalyst. Moreover, the production of ethylene glycol through these reactions requires a step for esterifying glycolic acid, which constitutes a complex process. In order to establish an industrially feasible process for producing ethylene glycol from formaldehyde applicants carried out investigations, which led to the finding that it is possible to prepare methyl methoxyacetate, which is useful as a precursor for the production of ethylene glycol, directly at a low temperature under a low pressure through the reaction of formaldehyde and carbon monoxide in the presence of a boron trifluoridemethanol complex catalyst containing a copper I compound and or silver compound. The gist of the present invention resides in a prowess for producing methyl methoxyacetate which comprises reacting formaldehyde or a derivative t hereof and carbon monoxide in the presence of a solution comprising boron trifluoride and methanol, and a copper I compound and or a silver compound. Then a sufficient amount of meth anol is added to complete the formation of said product. Formaldehyde The formaldehyde and derivatives thereof used in this invention include methanol solutions of formaldehyde and cyclic or linear polymers, e.g., trioxane and paraformaldehyde, and acetal, e.g., methylal. Catalyst The acid catalyst used in this invention is a boron trifluoride methanol complex represented by the formula BF3.xCH30H 1 x c 2 . It can be synthesized by blowing boron trifluoride gas into methanol. The copper I compound and or silver compound used as. catalvst in this invention may be any compound capable of forming copper I carbonyl and or silver carbonyl described below in the reaction system. A preferred example of such copper I compound is copper oxide and a preferred example of such silver compound is silver oxide or silver borofluoride. The copper I compound can be replaced by a 50 50 mixture of metallic copper and copper II compound, e.g., a mixture of copper powder and cupric oxide. The copper I carbonyl and or silver carbonyl is used in the molar ratio of 0.001 to 0.1 for 1 mol of BF3.xCH30H. Thus, relative to the former the latter is in. excess. Reactidn The process of the present invention is achieved by bringing formaldehyde into contact with the abovementioned catalyst in the presence of CO. The reaction temperature is preferably in the range of 10 to 1000C. In this temperature range, the copper I compound and silver compound used as co catalyst are present in the form of copper I carbonyl, Cu CO n n 1 to 4 and silver carbonyl, Ag CO m m 1 to 2 , respectively. Such cation most probably exists as an ion pair ith an anionic species of the BF3 methanol complex.The values n and m are close to 1 when the reaction temperature is high, and are close to 4 and 2, respectively, when the reaction temperature is low. Thus, although reaction rate increases at high temperatures, the reaction proceeds advantageously allow temperatures at which the values n and m are high. The reaction pressure is not specifically limited, but is usually 0.1 to 200 atmospheres, preferably 1 atmosphere to 200 atmospheres, to achieve a balance between the reaction rate and production cost. In the case where a high reaction temperature is employed or a comparatively weak acid catalyst is employed, a high pressure is preferred because a carbonyl cocatalyst does not form readily under such conditions. Usualiy, the reaction proceeds satisfactorily under low pressures around atmospheric pressure. According to this invention, copper I carbonyl and or silver carbonyl in BF3 methanol solution which may be prepared separately in advance or prepared in the reactor is placed in the carbon monoxide atmosphere. Then, a predetermined quantity of formaldehyde is added slowly with sufficient stirring at a prescribed temperature. The reaction proceeds rapidly and reaches a stage in which the absorption of CO into the reaction solution almost ceases. After completion of the reaction, the reaction solution is diluted with methanol, and the sulting methyl methoxyacetate is separated fom the solvent by distillation together with methanol. It is believed that the methanol for forming the ether methoxy group is derived from BF3 methanol complex during the reaction discussed above and that the ester methyl group is formed from methanol added after said reaction. Prior to distillation, a salt like NaF may be added to decompose the BF3methanol complex. In this case, the separated NaBF4 is decomposed to BF3 for recycling. The methyl methoxyacetate is purified by fractional distillation.Where ethylene glycol is desired as the final product, the methyl methoxyacetate is hydrolyzed to methyl glycolate and then hydrogenated to ethylene glycol with a known catalyst. The reaction can be accomplished batchwise, semi batchwise, or continuously. Stirring is desirable to improve the efficiency of contacting reactants with catalysts and to promote the dissolution of carbon monoxide into the reaction system. Effects of the Invention The process of the present invention has many advantages. It permits the reaction under mild conditions at low temperature and under low pressure. It permits the direct and selective production of methyl methoxyacetate which is a precursor of ethylene glycol. It permits the reduction of production cost because of less corrosion of apparatus. It simplifies the process. It forms substantially no polymer of glycolic acid, which inevitably decreases the yield in the prior art process. The invention is now described in more detail, though drily by way oi illustration, with reference to the following examples.Example 1 In a 200 ml four necked flask equipped with a stirrer was placed 0.715 g 0.005 mol of cuprous oxide.The atmosphere in the flask was replaced by carbon monoxide.Then, into the flask was introduced 50 ml of BF3.CH30H complex using a syringe. As soon as stirring was started, absorption of carbon monoxide started. Three minutes later, the molar ratio of carbon monoxide absorbed to copper I was about 3.2. To this solution was added dropwise with vigorous agitation 7.96 g 0.105 mol of methylal over 9 minutes. Agitation was continued for 3 hours at room temperature about 27 C , while keeping the partial pressure of carbon monoxide at 1 atmosphere, so that 1.928 liters of carbon monoxide was absorbed.Four hours later, an additional 0.214 liter of carbon monoxide was absorbed. Finally, 40 ml of methanol was added to the reaction liquid, while cooling with ice water. Gas chromatography and NMR analysis indicated the production of methyl methoxyacetate in an amount of 10.32 g 94.8 yield based on methylal .Example 2 Copper carbonyl in BF3 methanol solution was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1, and 3.00 g 0.100 mol of paraformaldehyde in place of methylal was added to the flask over about 3 minutes. As much carbon monoxide as 1.918 liters was absorbed within 25 minutes.Finally, 40 ml of methanol was added to the reaction liquid, while cooling with ice water. The reaction liquid was found by analysis to contain 7.75 g of methyl methoxyacetate 74.5 yield based on paraformaldehyde and 1.13 g of methyl glycolate yield 12.5 . Example 3 The reaction was carried out in the same manner as in Example 1 using 1.159 g 0.005 mol of silver oxide in place of cuprous oxide. The molar ratio of carbon monoxide absorbed to silver I was abdut 1.3. To the flask was added dropwise 7.68 g 0.101 mol of methylal.After agitation for 4 hours, 2.107 liters of carbon monoxide was absorbed. In subsequent 5.5 hours, additional 0.234 liter of carbon monoxide was absorbed.Finally, 40 ml of methanol was added to the reaction liquid, while cooling with ice water. The reaction liquid was found by analysis to contain 9.78 g of methyl methoxyacetate 93.1 yield based on methylal . Example 4 In a 300 ml glass lined autoclave equipped with a magnetic stirrer were placed 100 ml of BF3.1.5CH30H, 1.43 g 0.01 mol of cuprous oxide, and 6.00 g 0.200 mol of paraformaldehyde. The atmosphere in the autoclave was replaced by carbon monoxide, and the temperature of the autoclave was raised to 60 C. While keeping this temperature, carbon monoxide was introduced until the pressure increased to 75 kg cm2. While keeping this pressure, the reaction was carried out for 1 hour with stirring at 1000 rpm. Finally, 40 ml of methanol was added to the reaction liquid, while cooling with ice water.The reaction liquid was found by analysis to contain 19.24 g of methyl methoxyacetate 92.5 yield based on paraformaldehyde and 0.45 g of methyl glycolate 2.5 yield based on paraformaldehyde .
