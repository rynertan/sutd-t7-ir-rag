# MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY, A PROCESS FOR ITS PRODUCTION AND THE USE OF THIS MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY

## Abstract
A monoclonal antibody specific to human interleukin 2 is produced by a new antihuman IL 2 antibody producing clone, which is obtained by forming a hybridoma between an antibody producing cell of an animal immunized with human IL 2 and a myeloma cell and cloning the obtained hybridoma to select the desired clone. The new monoclonal antibody specific to human IL 2 may be used for determining the IL 2 content in blood by radioimmuneassay or enzymeimmuneassay. Further this monoclonal antibody specific to human IL 2 may be bound to an appropriate support in order to provide a carrier for affinity chromatography which can be used to obtain human IL 2 in high purity.
