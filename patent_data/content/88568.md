# Display vector generator utilising sine cosine accumulation.

## Abstract
A vector generator comprises X and Y digital to analogue converters 65, 66 providing X and Y deflection voltages to a cathode ray tube display, and X and Y digital accumulators 50, 51 provide respective inputs to the X and Y digitals to analogue converters. The word lenghts of the accumulators 50, 51 are wider than those of the digital to analogue converters 64, 65 and the digital to analogue converters derive their inputs from the most significant digits of the accumulators. X rate and Y rate signals proportional to the sine and cosine of the vector angle are applied as inputs to the respective accumulators 50, 51 which accumulate the rate signals with the present contents of the accumulators so as to generate linearly changing X and Y deflection signals. The vector angle is adjusted by changing the ratio of the sine to cosine inputs to the accumulators, and the vector speed is controlled by increasing and decreasing the sine and cosine signals but maintaining the ratio there between the same.
