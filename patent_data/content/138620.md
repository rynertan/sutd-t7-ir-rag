## Description
COLLAPSIBLE CONTAINER AND METHOD OF MAKING The present invention relates to collapsible sealed containers to dispense liquid products, and more particularly to such a container having a flexible conduit incorporated therein and to a method of making same. Many exemplary collapsible containers are available in the prior art which permit the extraction of a product from the container. Most of the containers use conventional dip tubes including an elongate cylindrical tube which includes an upper portion connected to a valve and a lower portion positioned within the product to be extracted from the container.For example, Daniels, U.S. Patent No. 3,171,571 discloses a conventional bag in box type of dispensing package including a dip tube. Another example of a dip tube positioned within a flexible bag is disclosed by Kramer, et al. U.S.Patent No. 2,859,899. The dip tube includes perforations through which the syrup or other material positioned within the flexible bag is sucked therefrom by means of a pump. U.S. Patent 4,286,636 to Credle discloses a collapsible bag with an extruded dip tube including at least one channel in the peripheral surface of the dip tube and extending along substantially the entire length of the dip tube. As a vacuum or suction is applied to the dip tube by a pump, initially all of the air within the collapsible bag is extracted therefrom. Subsequently, the liquid product is dispensed out of the collapsible bag and the bag collapses around a portion of the dip tube which is no longer surrounded by the liquid product. One of the disadvantages of the prior art collapsible containers including dip tubes is that they require the insertion of a dip tube, and thus of an additional step in the manufacture of the filled container. Additionally, because of the geometry of the dip tube and the collapsible container, the insertion of the dip tube could not be handled through automated means, but rather requires manual insertion. Summary of the Invention Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a flexible conduit for a collapsible bag which can be inserted during the formation of the bag and requires no manipulative steps after filling of the collapsible container. According to the invention, there is provided a collapsible container having two opposed side walls and an outlet provided in one wall, and comprising an elongate flexible rib member disposed along the inner surface of one wall and extending at least to a position adjacent the outlet, said rib member being effective to define a liquid flow channel through at least the major part of said container, whereby liquid may be dispensed from substantially all of said container as it collapses. The preferred embodiment provides at least one pair of flexible substantially parallel rib members disposed adjacent to an interior wall of the collapsible container. The flexible rib members are positioned within a collapsible bag and substantially adjacent to an annular spout member. Initially, air within the collapsible bag will be drawn therefrom.Subsequently, the liquid product diposed within the collapsible bag will flow through a channel formed by the adjacent ribs and the collapsible bag will collapse around the rib members. Progressively, as the liquid product is removed from the collapsible bag, the bag will continue to collapse around the rib members until all of the liquid product is dispensed therefrom. A further feature of the present invention is that the rib members can be disposed on a web which can be disposed betwen two flexible sheets which comprise a collapsible bag during the manufacture of the bag. The major advantage of this development is that it avoids substantial manipulative steps both in the manufacture and assembling of the collapsible container and in the filling and use of the bag. Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be understood that the detailed description of the invention and the specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description. Fig. 1 is an isometric, partially cut away front side view of a collapsible bag according to the present invention Fig. 2 is an enlarged cross sectional partial view of the collapsible bag including an annular spout adjacent to which are disposed a plurality of ribs according to the present invention Fig. 3 is an exploded view of an embodiment of the present invention and Fig. 4 is a lateral cross sectional view of a collapsible bag which illustrates the operation of the invention. Detailed Description A collapsible container 10 is used to dispense a liquid product therefrom. The collapsible container may be used in combination with a post mix beverage system. Such a post mix beverage system is disclosed in our U.S. Patent No. 4,014,461. As illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, the collapsible container 10 is made of a pair of sheets of flexible material 12 and 14 joined together at their respective peripheries 16 and 18. The flexible sheets are joined in a sealed relationship throughout the periphery and in the case of flexible sheets made of thermoplastic material, this may be a seal achieved by means of heat sealing or suitable adhesive.The collapsible bag 10 includes an annular spout, or bag fitment 20 disposed through the flexible sheet 12 and attached thereto by means of an annular flange 22. The spout 20 may be of any desired geometry which can be adapted to fit into a coupling for a suction system. Indeed as would be obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art, the spout 20 may be any shape including non annular. As shown in more detail in Fig. 2, the flexible sheets 12 and 14 may comprise a number of plies, e.g.24 and 26. In the preferred embodiment, two plies are used. Ply 24 is a web of 2 mil. 0.05 mm EVA ethylene vinyl acetate , disposed adjacent to second ply 26 which is a bonded web made up of the following three sheets 2 mil 0.05 mm EVA, 1 2 mil. 0.013 mm metalized PET polyethylene terephthalate , and 2 mil. 0.05 mm EVA. The collapsible container 10 includes at least one pair of ribs 30 disposed through the length of the collapsible container 10, shown inFig. 1, and in relation to the annular spout 20 so that the pair of ribs 30 passes substantially adjacent to, and in line with the opening 21 of the annular spout 20. Although a pair of ribs is described, a single rib or protrusion 30 of sufficient height would be sufficient to achieve the objectives of the invention, although not as efficiently as a pair of ribs alternatively an open groove may be formed on one of the walls.The ribs 30 are slight protrusions which are closely spaced together. The ribs 30 may be extruded onto the flexible sheet 14, or in the case of a two ply sheet, on the inner layer 24. In the preferred embodiment, the ribs 30 are disposed on the flexible sheet opposite to the flexible sheet where the annular spout 20 is attached. However, the present invention will also encompass the placement of the ribs on the flexible sheet on which the annular spout 20 is disposed, which although not as efficient, also can provide significant advantages over the system shown in the prior art. As illustrated in Fig. 3 another embodiment of the present invention includes a web strip 34 including at least one pair of ribs 30 disposed between the flexible sheets 12 and 14 and adjacent to, and in line with the annular spout 20. The web strip 35 should be made of compatible material with the flexible sheets 12 and 14 so that it can be bonded thereto. For example, if the interior ply of the sheets 12 and 14 is made out of EVA then the web strip 35 should be made of EVA or compatible material e.g. low density polyethylene .The web strip 35 is attached at its ends to the flexible sheets 12 and 14 during the formation of the bag, when the adjacent sheets are secured at their periphery thus, for example heat sealing of the adjacent flexible sheets 12 and 14 will also achieve the heat sealing and fixation of the flexible strip web 34. Illustrated in Fig. 4 is the operation of the ribs 30. As the flexible container 10 collapses, it has a tendency to collapse somewhat unevenly, leaving pockets of liquid which may become isolated from the rest of the liquid in the container. The ribs 30 form a conduit which cannot be closed off by the atmospheric pressure on the walls of the flexible sheets 12 and 14. Thus, the entire inner chamber of the flexible bag remains in communication with the spout 20 at all times during the operation. The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.
