## Abstract
Method for igniting a combustion chamber with a flui dized bed upon start up and a power plant for carrying out the method. According to the invention bed material, which is heated to the ignition temperature of a start up fuel, is transferred from a storage container 40 to the combustion chamber 8 , and fuel is supplied to the bed 14 . The airflow through the nozzles 13 of the combustion chamber bottom 12 are reduced during said transfer of bed material and are increased again when the fuel is supplied. The power plant according to the invention is equipped with means for tem porarily by passing the nozzles 13 of the combustion cham ber during the transfer of the hot bed material to the combustion chamber. For preheating and storing the bed material to be supplied to the combustion chamber, an iso lated container 40 is provided, which is separated from the combustion chamber and positioned at a level above the bottom of the combustion chamber. In a plant with a com bustion chamber 8 enclosed in a pressure vessel 10 , a connection with a valve 55 for by passing the air flow may be provided between the space 11 in the pressure vessel and the freeboard 18 of the combustion chamber 8 for reducing the air flow through the bed. Further, control means 38, 80 are provided for carrying out the necessary opera tions of valves, and the like, during the start up operation.
