# Portable computer.

## Abstract
The computer comprises a housing with a base portion 15 covered at the back by a rear top cover 19 to provide a chamber within which there are disposed the computer electronics and two disc drives with disk insertion slots in the right hand side wall of the housing. The front part of the housing base portion 15 carries a keyboard which can be closed by a front cover 16 hinged to the rear cover 19 . The front cover 17 , when opened up, exposes an 80 column, 25 line liquid crystal display for the computer. The bottom of the housing base portion 15 has a major flat portion at the rear which provides a suitable base on which the computer rests for lap held use. The front part, beneath the keyboard, inclines upwards and a hinged flap 21 at the rear of the computer can be opened up to tilt the computer onto the inclined front portion of the underside of the base 15 . This provides a convenient keyboard and viewing angle for use on a desk surface. The flap 21 also serves, when closed, to cover a rear panel of the computer, provided with various sockets.
