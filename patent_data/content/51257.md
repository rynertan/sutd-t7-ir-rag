# Pull push switch.

## Abstract
A pull push switch has one or two stationary contacts 25,26 and one U shaped elastic movable contact 23 with two legs 23,24 which, when not deformed, are adapted to resiliently make into contact with the stationary contacts. A cam 31 is securely mounted on an operating shaft which can be axially shifted between the pulled and pushed positions. The cam has a small diameter cylindrical portion 29 contiguous with a tapered intermediate portion 28 which in turn is contiguous also with a large diameter cylindrical portion 30 . The legs of the elastic movable contact are so positioned that they are normally maintained in contact with the peripheral surface of the cam as it is shifted in unison with the operating shaft so that when the shaft is pushed or pulled, the legs of the elastic movable contact rest on the small diameter cylindrical portion of the cam and subsequently make contact with the stationary contacts, whereby the switch is closed. When the operating shaft 1 is pulled or pushed, the legs of the elastic movable contact ride on the large diameter cylindrical portion of the cam so that they are forced to bend outward or moved away from each other and from the stationary contacts and consequently the switch is opened.
