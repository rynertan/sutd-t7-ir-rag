# Semiconductor integrated circuit device.

## Abstract
A programmable semiconductor integrated circuit de vice is disclosed, which includes different kinds of function blocks 12 1, 12 2,... 12 N formed on a substrate 10 . First wiring lines 22 1,22 2... 22 N extending in a row direction are connected to input terminals of the function blocks 12 , respectively. Second wiring lines 24 1, 24 2 ... 24 N are connected to output terminals of the function blocks 12 , respectively. The second wirings 24 are T shaped and have respective line components extending in a column direction. Floating gate type field effect transistors 26 are provided, in a matrix manner, at mutually electrically insulated crossing points among the first and second lines 22, 24 . The electrical state of the switching transistors 26 can be set independently and changeably, under the control of row and column decoders 30, 32 , to specify a desired wiring pattern of the function blocks 12 by having the shortest signal transmission paths of the first and second wiring lines 22, 24 through the hardware as in the case of a custom LSI, thereby realizing the desired custom made LSI.
