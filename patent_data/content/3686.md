# Electrochemical synthesis.

## Abstract
A liquid phase electrochemical synthesis is possible wherein a desired charged intermediate would normally be undesirably immediately electrolysed, by covalently trapping the charged intermediate onto particles of a sulphonated polystyrene, filtering off the liquid, and regenerating the polystyrene in say alkali to release and hydrolyse the intermediate. Hexamethylbenzene may be electrolysed in acetonitrile to give, by this process, 1, 3 2,4,5,6 tetramethyl bisacetamido methylbenzene.
