## Description
WIRE ARTICLES AND METHOD OF AND KIT OF PARTS FOR FORMING SAME. This invention relaes to wire articles and to a method of and a kit of parts for forming wire articles. Many different wire articles are used in homes, gardens, offices, shops, etc., including record and cassette racks, dish racks, vegetable racks7 wine racks, bird cages, tool racks, wire trays, wire display stands, colthes driers anci airers, an the 1 like. Such wire articles are sold as manufactured products ana are generally formed by cutting, bending and welding or soldering metal wire to form a required article. The wire article so formed is then generally provided with a required surface finish, e.g., is dip or otherwise coated with synthetic plastics material cr spray or otherwise coated with metallic or other paint.Such manufactured wire articles suffer from the disadvantage0 that they are not adaptable to individual requirements and are relatively expensive to buy. The present invention has as its object to provide a method of and a kit of parts for forming wire articles which will tenable articles to be formed according to individual requirements. The present invention provides a method of forming a wire article which comprises cutting wire stock into lengths of predetermined size, if necessary bending at least one of said cut lengths of wire, obtaining a plurality of connector members each comprising at least two socket portions each of which is adapted to receive an end portion of a cut length of wire, and connecting the cut lengths of wire together by means of the connector embers to form a required article. The present invention also providers a wire article comprising a plurality of cut lengths of wire of predetermined size and connector members connecting the cut lengths of wire together to form the article, the connector members each comprising at least two socket portions each of which receives an end portion of a cut length of wire. The present invention further provides a kit of parts for forming wire articles, the kit of parts comprising a supply of wire and a plurality of connector members each comprising at least two socket portions ach of which is adapted to receive an end portion of the wire. The supply of wire in the kit of parts ma be a continuous length of wire, e.g, a coil or stain of wire, which can be cut into lengths of predetermined size or may be pre cut into lengthe of predetermined size for forming a particular article or articles The kit of parts may include means for cutting and or bending the wire e.g., may include a wire cutting tool or a pair of pliers.The kit of parts may include instructions for cutting, bending and connecting the cut lengths of wire to forrt a particular article or articles. The wire used in the method, the article and the kit of parts of the present invention is preferably metal wire which is circular in section and has a diameter of not more than 6.0 mm, preferably from 1.6mm to 3.OOmm. Preferahly the wire has been pre finished, i.e. has been provided with a suitable surface finish, e.g., has been coated with a suitable synthetic plastics materia or with a suitable paint or other surface coating material such as a metallic paint or lacquer. Preferably the method of the present invention includes the further step of securing the end portions of the cut lengths of wire in the socket portions of the connector members by means of a suitable adhesive when connecting the cut lengths of wire together, and to this end the kit of parts may include a supply, e.g., a tube, of suitable adhesive. It has been found necessarsfr in order to satisfactorily adhesively secure the end portions,of the wire in the said socket portions to provide a clearance fit of the end portions of the wire in the socket portions. It has also be found that the size of tis clearance is critical. If the clearance is too sraall or if the end portions of the wire are a tight fit in the socket portions then air becomes trapped in the socket portions and the end portions of the wire cannot be inscrted fully into the socket portions. On tte other hand if the clearance is too large then the strength of the adhesive bond will be impaired.Thus it has been found that the clearance should not be less than 0.05mm. and should not be greate than 0.254mm. and that the clearance is preferably from O.lOirm. tc 0.178mm. The said connector members may be of various different kinds for connecting the cut lengths of wire together in various different ways. For example, one kind of connector member may comprise two socket portions which are axially aligned for connecting two cut lengths of wire end to end in axial alignment. Such one kind of connector member may, for example, be in the forin of a hollow tube into opposite ends of which can be inserted the end portions of to cut lengths of wire to be connected together.Other kinds of connector member may comprise two or more socket portions both or at least two of which have their axes angled with respect to one another, e.g., may comprise a right angle connector member for connecting t.io cut lengths of wire at right angles to one another, aTee shaped connector member for connecting trree cut lengths of wire together in a Tee formation, a Y shaped connector member for connecting three cut lengths of wire together irk a Y formation, or an X shaped connector member for connecting four cut lengths of wire together in anX frmation.The kit of parts of the present invention will contain a numbar of connector members of selected different types sufficient to enable a particular article or articles to be formed. The said connector members are preferahly formed, e.g., moulded, from synthetic plastics materialS although they could, if desired be formed from metal, wood or other suitable material. The kit of parts may also include one or more feet for supporting an article formed from the kit. The or each such foot may comprise a socket portion adapted to receive an end portion of a said cut length of wire and may, for example, be in the form of a solid sphere of plastics or other suitable material having an aperture therein which forms the socket portion. Some wire articles, such as a record rack or a toast rack, may require the use of a base member, e.g., a base board, and the method of the present invention may comprise providing a base member, e.g., of polished wood or a suitable plastics material, having apertures therein adapted to receive end portions of the cut lengths of wire and inserting the end portions of the cut lengths of wire in said apertures. Likewise the kit of parts of the present invention may comprise a base member having apertures therein adapted to receive end portions of the wire. The kit of parts of the present invention may further comprise fixtures or fittings necessary for the forming of a particular article or articles, e.g. may comprise one or more shelves and shelf supports, one or more wall brackets whereby an article formed can be mounted on a wall, one or more trays or other containers, and or one or more hook members. Fixtures and fittings such as shelf supports, wall brackets or hook members m.ay comprise a sleeve portion through which a cut length of wire can b inserted and which. can, if required, he secured at a required position on the cut length of wire by means of a suitable adhesive. The invention will be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows cut lengths of wire for use in the method of the present invention, Figs. 2A to 2K show various kinds of connector members which may form part of a kit cf parts according to the present invention, Figs. 3A to 3C show different kinds of feet which may form part of a kit of parts according to the present invention, Figs. 4A to 4E show different fixtures and fittings which ma form. part of a kit of parts according to the invention, and Figs. 5A to 5D show examples of articles which can he formed with a kit of parts according to the present invention. A kit of parts according to the present invention comprises a supply of wire which may be in the form of a continuous length, e.g., a coil or skein, suitable for cutting into lengths of predetermined size or may be in the form of cut lengths la, ib, ic, etc., of predetermined size as illustrated in Fig. 1. In addition the kit of parts comprises a plurality of connector members which may be cf various differ. nt types for connecting the cut lengths of wire together in various different ways in order to enable one or more required articles to be formed. Various aifferent types of connector member are illustrated in Figs. 2A to 2K. Thus Fig. 2A shows a connector member 2 in the form of a hollow tube the opposite ends of which are adapted to receive end portions of two cut lengths of wire so as to connect the two cut lengths 6f wire in endto end axial alignment.
