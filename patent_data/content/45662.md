## Description
This invention relates to modified bitumens and to a process for producing them. The invention is more especially concerned with bitumens modified chemically, which chemically modified bitumens have improved rheological properties rendering them useful, for example, in roadmaking. In the past, rheological or other properties of bitumens have been altered in several ways. Thus, for example, bitumen has been chemically modified by oxidation or dehydrogenation , or by treatment with sulphur. For example chlorides of i tin and other metals, ii silicon and iii phosphorus have been suggested for treating a tar British Patent 285,000 . Chlorides of zinc and other metals and of phosphorus have been mentioned for treating bitumen British Patent 382842 . Metal chlorides, sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid have been disclosed for treating bitumen British Patent 1,331,609 . Further, it has been proposed to catalyse the air oxygen blowing of bitumen, to give an oxidised bitumen, by means of a catalytic quantity of an anhydrous solution of phosphorus pentoxide in phosphoric acid British Patent 916,531 .The use of phosphorus pentoxide alone as a catalyst in bitumen blowing processes is described in Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Vol 45 No. 10, Page 2121 ff. Bitumen has also been modified by blending with other materials, for example, synthetic rubbers, natural rubber, various synthetic homo or co polymers, and elastomers. The modified bitumen products have different properties according to the nature of the modification achieved and the manufacturing method employed the manufacturing methods often being expensive in materials and or treatment times involved. There is required at the present time a moderatelypriced bituminous binder which has improved fatigue resistance properties and which imparts improved resistance to permanent deformation to surfacings incorporating that binder. It is one object of the present invention to provide a modified bitumen which, among other characteristics, at least substantially meets the aforesaid requirement for a bituminous binder. According to dne aspect of the present invention there is provided a chemically modified bitumen possessing phosphoruscontaining functional groups which are capable of reaction to form a phosphorus containing compound of a metal, preferably a polyvalent metal, or of an ammonium group or an amine.The phosphorus containing functional groups may be, for example, acidic functional groups capable of neutralization to form a metal, ammonium or amine salt. They may also be, for example, groups which will form an ion with which a metal counter ion can associate to form a relatively stable product. According to another aspect, the invention provides a chemically modified bitumen possessing phosphorus containing functional groups which have been reacted to form a phosphoruscontaining compound of a metal, preferably of a polyvalent metal, or of an ammonium group or amine. Preferably the said phosphorus containing groups are phosphonic or thiophosphonic groups. The preferred metals are calcium, barium and zinc. Other polyvalent metals which may be employed include magnesium, aluminium and iron.Monovalent metals may be found suitable, for example potassium and sodium. In a further aspect, the invention provides a process for the production of the chemically modified bitumens which comprises reacting the bitumen with the said phosphoruscontaining compound, and thereafter optionally hydrolysing and which process will also comprise further reaction when the metal or amine or ammonium compound iormation is required. By the term compound as employed herein, is meant a true chemical compound, which includes a salt, and a compound wherein an ion and a counter ion associate to form a relatively stable chemical structure. For the formation of thiophosphonic groups the preferred compound employed is phosphorus pentasulphide. For phosphonic groups the preferred compound is phosphorus pentoxide. The phosphorus compounds normally employed in a quantity of 0.5 to 25 wt. , more usually 2 to 7.5 wt. , preferably 2.5 to 5 wt. , calculated as phosphorus and based on the wt. of the bitumen. In all cases reaction temperatures are normally in the range 1000 to 1750, more usually 1250C to 1600C, preferably 1400C to 1500C. Reaction times depend, at least to some extent, on the final properties required.For example, starting with a bitumen having a softening point Ring and Ball ASTM D36 of 400C then an increase to a higher softening point, say 1Q00C, will take longer the lower the temperature employed in the range 1000C to 1750C.Thus, with a 5 wt. P2S5 or P205 treat rate, some 6 hours at 1250C or 2 hours at 1500C could be required. It is preferred to employ short periods, and hence the higher temperatures. Any hydrolysis and or further reaction conducted for example neutralization for metal, amine or ammonium compound formation, may be at any suitable temperature. Thus it may be in the aforesaid 1000C to 1750C range. Preferably, however, the temperature is lower than in the reaction step, being suitably in the range 1200C to 1400C, preferably about 1250C to 1400C. Again it is found in general that longer periods of time are required for the lower temperatures in the range. Normally one hour is required for a neutralization at 1400C. It is preferred to employ the oxide, hydroxide or acetate of the desired metal s for forming the metal compound s .Other anions are possible, for example formate, propionate.It is highly preferred to employ as anion one which will give rise to easily removable gaseous or liquid reaction byproducts. Bitumens which can be modified in accordance with the present invention are non oxidised bitumens or non blown bitumens, and include natural bitumens or a mineral pitch or a tar obtained as a product from coal or oil. Preferably a petroleum bitumen is employed such.as is obtained as the residue from vacuum distillation of crude oil. If desired, only a portion of such a residue may be employed, for example the precipitated asphalt obtained on treating the residue with a lower alkane, for example propane. The invention is especially suitable for use with penetration grades of bitumen, such as those having i a softening point R B not above 450C, suitably from 300C to substantially 400C, and ii a corresponding penetration units of O.lmm at 250C ASTM D 5 of from 300 to 80. The preferred chemically modified bitumens of the invention are those having the metal compound of the phosphoruscontaining groups. It is possible to obtain such a modified bitumen having intrinsic elastic properties due to the interaction between the modified molecules of the bitumen and the metal ions introduced into the system during the further reaction, for example neutralization. Such a modified bitumen is very suited for use as a binder giving surfaces prepared therewith a improved resistance to fatigue, without adversely affecting the resistance to permanent deformation, and b increased ravelling resistance. By way of illustration of the invention, two samples of a petroleum bitumen, of 410C softening point R B and approximately 200 penetration, were taken. Both were heated with 5 for 6 hrs at 150 C wt. calculated as phosphorus and based on the bitumen , one with P2S5 the other with P205. Properties of the P205 treated bitumen were measured. Substantially of both complete neutralization was thereafter effected employingCa, Ba and Zn compounds in solid form. Properties of the resultant products were measured. The results are shown in the following Tables 1 and 2.

Tobolski, published byJ. Wiley and Sons, 1960 Edition. For use in roadmaking a suitable procedure would be to mix the modified bitumen of the invention very preferably the metal compound type , preheated to 1500C to 1700C, preferably 1600C, with aggregate preheated to a similar temperature. The mixing and laying would be in conventional manner. Thus the benefits of the modified bitumen of the invention can be obtained without recourse to new roadmaking processes and apparatus. Some 6 parts of the modified bitumen per hundred parts of aggregate may be employed. The modified bitumen may itself be first mixed with a filler, suitably up to a 1 1 ratio modified bitumen to filler. For purposes of comparison, the same petroleum bitumen starting material was treated with phosphoric acid 5 wt calculated as phosphorus and based on the bitumen . Reaction was attempted over a period of about 3 hours at 1500C. The softening point of the product after this treatment had only risen to 430C, that is to say by only 20C. The product was then treated with 6.2 wt zinc oxide, but it was found that there were no material differences in the properties of the thus treated product from the phosphoric acid treated material. Hence there had been no material modification of the starting bitumen on employing phosphoric acid and there were substantially no phosphorus containing functional groups present for reaction with the zinc oxide.
