# Apparatus for mixing or granulation of particles.

## Abstract
A drum granulator 10 is described in which at least a part of the cylindrical outer wall is resilient. This can be achieved, for example, by forming the drum from steel and fitting it with a re silient rubber lining, which is exposed in way of circumferen tially extending slots in the steel. The drum rotates past piv otted rollers which are allowed to descend abruptly onto the re silient part of the wall, dislodging any material which adhered to it.
