# Mechanical press and method of assembly.

## Abstract
The crown portion 20 of a press has an open top thereby permitting the crankshaft and connection arm assembly 56 to be lowered therein in a pre assembled state. A cover plate 48 is then fitted to the crown and a motor 50 assembly is mounted thereon. Since the crown does not have to be inverted for the fitting of the crankshaft assembly it is possible for the press frame comprising the bed 14, uprights 18 and crown to be formed as a single casting thereby avoiding the necessity for tie rods.
