# Transmitter for transmitting an FSK modulated signal.

## Abstract
A transmitter for transmitting FSK modulated signals by means of an inductive aerial. With a large frequency deviation, such as with FFSK modulated signals, and a high transmission rate, which may cause the occurrence of a non constant envelope electronic equipment arranged in the vicinity is subjected to a greater degree of interference than with a small modulation depth and a low transmission rate. By generating in the transmitter and aerial current whose amplitude changes inversely proportionally to the frequency, tuning is not necessary and still a constant envelope is obtained.
