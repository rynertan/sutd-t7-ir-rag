# COLLAPSIBLE ELONGATE MINE SUPPORT

## Abstract
A mine support comprises a length of timber pole 1 with wood removed to form longitudinally extending and tapering planar strips 2 spaced circumferentially around it. The adja cent edges of the planar surfaces do not need to undercut the pole circumference, and a reinforcing sleeve 6 is fitted over the pole against the pole surface around and between the pla nar surfaces.
