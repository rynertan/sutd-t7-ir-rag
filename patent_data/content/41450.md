# Disc brake.

## Abstract
A disc brake includes a pair of friction elements which cooperate with a caliper 26 to engage a rotor 10 . A torque plate 12 movably supports the caliper via at least one pin 24 . The pin is received with an aperture 40 on the caliper and a resilient member 44 within the aperture accomodates the clearance between the pin and caliper. The resilient member defines at least one rib 54 or 56 substantially dis posed outside the aperture. The rib is deformable axially to generate a restoring force biasing the caliper and at least one of the pair of friction elements to return to a rest position.
