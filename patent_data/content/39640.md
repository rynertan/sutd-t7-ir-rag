# Electrical connector assembly having anti decoupling mechanism.

## Abstract
An anti decoupling mechanism for preventing un wanted decoupling of an electrical connector as a result of vibration. The decoupling mechanism includes a one piece gull shaped spring 400 mounted to a connector coupling ring 300 . The spring 400 includes a central portion 410 having an arcuate groove 411 formed thereon and a pair of wing members 420, 430 extending outwardly therefrom, the arcuate portion being secured in place by a pin 600 interference fit through a hole 331 disposed in the coupling ring. Each wing member in cludes first and second strips in superposed relation and a medial enlargement or tooth member 440 projecting radially inward from a forward surface of one of the strips and adapted to engage ratchet teeth 141 disposed on one of the connectors, the wings biasing the tooth against the ratchet teeth to increase anti decoupling torque.
