# Line protector for a communications circuit.

## Abstract
A line protector has a housing 2 with coaxial surge voltage arresters 40, 40 , line terminals 66, 68 and a ground terminal 70 . One line terminal 68 is sub stantially at one end of the cavity of the housing while the other line terminal 66 extends substantially the full length of the cavity of the housing. The ground ter minal extends from between the arresters to said one end of the housing cavity. Eeach terminal projects from the housing at said one end. The three terminals are insulated from the arresters by barrier walls 56, 60 in the housing. A cover 26 closes a side opening 16 in the housing through which the components of the protector are inserted.
