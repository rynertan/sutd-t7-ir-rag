# ARRANGEMENT FOR PROVIDING DATA SIGNALS FOR A DATA DISPLAY SYSTEM

## Abstract
The present invention includes a microprocessor 15 which acts to generate rasters of its signals from its read only memory ROM , thereby forming character representations of groups of coded signals, such as ASCII coded signals, coming from a main data processing device. The rasters of bit signals are temporarily stored in a buffer 23 which at a subsequent time transmits, in parallel, groups of said bit signals to a bit map memory 33 through logic circuitry. The group, or block, transfer of these bit signals in parallel occurs during horizontal or vertical blank periods. The parallel transfer during the blank periods provides part of the basis for acceleration of the transfer of data to a display device as compared with the prior art. In addition, the micro processor provides address information signals to a graphic display controller 19 , which in turn provides starting addresses for the location of the bit signals. In addition, a bit map memory device is employed to provide pixel information to a CRT display device 51 to create the characters to be displayed.
