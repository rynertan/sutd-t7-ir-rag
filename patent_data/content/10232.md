## Description
BACKGROUND or THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a herbicidal composition in which two active ingredients impart synergistic effect. Recently, many herbicides have been proposed and practicaily used to contribute to elimination of agricultural labour works. Thus, various problems on herbicidal effects and safety of the herbicides have been found in the practical applications. It has been awaited to find improved herbicides which have no adverse effect to the object plants and effective to noxious weeds in a small dose of the active ingredient and significantly safe without any environmental pollution. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a herbicidal composition which has excellent herbicidal effect and safety and which is especially effective to control weeds without phytotoxicity to beet. The herbicidal composition of the present invention comprises a phenoxypentenoic acid derivative having the formulaEMI1.1 tb SEP RO OC1 1CH CHCOI SEP I tb SEP 3 SEP ,Ct SEP tY tb wherein SEP R SEP represents SEP Ce SEP or SEP X and X represents a halogen atom or trifluoromethyl group Y represents hydrogen atom or chlorine atom R represents an alkoxyl group, an alkenyloxyl group, hydroxyl group or O Cat. Cat inorganic or organic cation or SR R an alkyl group and a carbamate derivative having the formulaEMI2.1 wherein R l Zpresents methyl or ethyl group X represents hydrogen atom or methyl group as active ingredients with a carrier. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The phenoxypentenoic acid derivatives I used in the present invention have no phytotoxicity to broad leaf weeds and are safe to broad leaf crop plants such as radish, soy bean, peanut, cotton, flax, beet, pimento and sunflower but are remarkably effective as herbicides to gramineous weeds such as barnyard grass, large crab grass, johnson grass, maize, quack grass, dent foxtail, and paspalum grass though they are less effective to annual bluegrass. On the other hand, the carbamate derivatives used in the present invention are substantially not effective as herbicides to gramineous weeds but are remarkably effective as herbicides to broad leaf weeds though they are less effective to green amaranth in Amaranthaceae and grown broad leaf weed in high leaf stage such as pale smartweed in Polygonaceae and has no phytotoxicity to beet in Chenopa diaceae. the herbicidal compositions of the prcsent invention have the advantageous characteristic to maintain longer herbicidal effect than those of the application of each single component. The herbicidal compositions of the present invention have surprisingly unexpected high synergistic effect to broad leaf weeds and gramineous weeds and a dose of the herbicides can be remarkably decreased. An absorption of the carbamate derivative into plants is improved by combining the phenoxypentenoic acid derivative with the carbamate derivative. Therefore, it is possible to completely control broad leaf weed in high leaf stage such as pale smartweed in Polygonaceae and also green amaranth in Amaranthaceae and annual bluegrass inGramineae which have not been effectively controlled by the conventional herbicides. Therefore, it is possible to completely control grown broad leaf weeds in high leaf stage such as pale smartweed which have not been effectively controlled. Moreover, the herbicidal compositions are effective to pale smartweed and annual bluegrass which could not be controlled by either of these herbicidal active ingredient. Thus, regeneration of weeds can be prevented by applying the herbicidal composition of the present invention. The herbicidal composition of the present invention can completely control broad leaf weeds and gramineous weeds without phytotoxicity to beet. Suitable phenoxypentenoic acid derivatives having the formula I used in the herbicidal composition of the present invention include 4 4 4 trifluoromethylphenoxy 2 pentenoic acid its esters such as methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl, secbutyl, t butyl, n amyl, iso amyl, n octyl or allyl esters its salts such as sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, ammonium, methylamine or dimethylamine salt its thiol esters such as methyl, ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl, n butyl, iso butyl, sec butyl or t butyl thiol esters 4 4 hromophenoxy phenoxy 2 pentenoic acid and its esters such as metiiyl, ethyl or iso propyl esters 4 4 4 iodophenoxy phenoxy 2 pentenoic acid and its esters such as methyl, ethyl or iso propyl esters 4 4 2,4 dichlorophenoxy phenoxy 2 pentenoic acid and its esters such as ethyl or iso propyl esters 4 4 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethylphenoxy phenoxy 2 pentenoic acid and its esters such as methyl, ethyl iso propyl, n butyl or allyl esters 4 4 2 bromo 4 trifluoromethylphenoxy phenoxy 2 pentenoic acid and its esters such as ethyl ester 4 4 2 chloro 4 bromophenoxy phenoxy 2 pentenoic acid and its esters such as methyl ethyl, iso propyl or allyl esters 4 4 3,5 dichloropyridyl 2 oxy phenoxy 2 pentenoic acid and its esters such as methyl, ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl, n butyl, iso butyl, sec butyl, t butyl or allyl esters or its salts such as sodium or diethylamine salts its thiol esters such as methyl or ethyl thiol esters.
