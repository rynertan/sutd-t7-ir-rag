# DEVICE FOR MOUNTING ON THE RUNG OF A LADDER LIKE MEMBER

## Abstract
The present invention provides a device adapted to be mounted upon the rungs 3 of a ladder like member 1 and 2, which device comprises a generally rectangular and planar load bearing member 10 having, preferably at or adjacent one edge thereof, means 12 for engaging a rung 3 of the ladder like member 1 and 2 and for locating the planar member 10 on the ladder like member 1 and 2 so that it can be pivotted about the rung 3 on which it is located, the planar member 10 also being provided with a stay 20 adapted to engage with another rung 3 of the ladder like member 1 and 2 and to retain the planar member 10 extended from the plane of the ladder like member 1 and 2 and thus form a platform for a user of the ladder like member 1 and 2 characterised in that the stay 20 comprises a pair of arms 21 pivotably mounted on the planar member 10 at or adjacent the edge opposed to the rung engaging means 12, each arm 21 carrying means 25 for engaging a rung 3 of the ladder like member 1 and 2, the arms 21 being spaced apart by a distance not significantly less than the lateral width of the planar member 10, whereby the arms 21 can be disengaged from the rung 3 to permit the planar member 10 and the arms 21 to lie substantially parallel to the plane of the ladder like member 1 and 2 with the arms 21 lying to either side of a planar member 10 mounted on a lower rung 3 of the ladder like member 1 and 2.
