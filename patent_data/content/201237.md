# Flocculation processes.

## Abstract
A cross linked high molecular weight polymer formed from a water soluble monomer or blend of monomers and which has IV and or solubility and or rheology properties indicating that it would be unsuitable for use as a flocculant can be used as a flocculant after shearing the polymeric material. The shearing may be applied to the polymeric material before addition to the suspension that is to be flocculated or can be applied to the suspension that is being flocculated. The shearing increases the intrinsic viscosity of the polymeric material and can improve its rheology and solubility. The polymeric material must be of high molecular weight.
