# Fluoroelastomer containing non tacky electrically conductive coating composition.

## Abstract
A fluoroelastomer containing non tacky electrically con ductive coating composition which comprises a a fluoroelastomer, b a fluororesin, c a coupling agent, d an electrically conducting material, e a liquid vehicle and optionally f an inorganic fibrous material, the weight ratio of the fluoroelastomer a and the fluororesin b being from 95 5 to 35 65, a coating film formed from which has electrical conductivity as well as the properties inherent to the fluoroelastomer.
