# Signal converting method and circuit for television receiver.

## Abstract
A signal converting circuit is disclosed for converting a television signal for 2 1 interlaced scanning system to another television signal for 1 1 non interlaced scanning system using line memories 3,45 for storing image data of two adjacent scanning lines of a present field and field memories 23, 24 for storing image data of a last occurring field. An interpolation signal 10 is produced by controlling a value of the televisions signal 16, 17 of the two adjacent scanning lines in response to the television signal 29 of the two adjacent scanning lines in the present field and the television signal of a scanning line positioned between the two adjacent scanning lines in the last occurring field.
