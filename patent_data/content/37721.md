# NUMERICAL MACHINE TOOL CONTROL

## Abstract
A numerical machine tool control system includes a plur ality of machine tools 11, 12,... controlled by a correspond ing plurality of numerical control circuits 21, 22... , each of which includes a manual data inputting panel 31,32,... . An automatic operation command device 8 is common to all of the numerical control circuits. Transmission means 71,72,... is provided between each of the numerical control circuits and the operation command device for exchanging input data for the machine tool and output data from the machine tool, for exchanging data for the manual data panel and data from the manual data panel, and for exchanging treatment program data. The entire operation of the plurality of machine tools is thereby controlled by the operation com mand device.
