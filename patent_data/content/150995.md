# TYRE BREAKER ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A tyre breaker comprising at least two breaker plies 4 is assembled on a carrier ring 10 which is movable between ply fitting stations 2,3 . The ring is mounted on an arm 5 which swings the ring 10 through 90 to each fitting station 2 or 3 where the ply 4 is supported on a table. Each end of the ply is then moved from the table on to the ring by means of grippers 16 , and rollers 18 then traverse the ring 10 to ensure that the ply 4 is positioned accurately. The joints formed in successive plies are diametrically opposed to one another.
