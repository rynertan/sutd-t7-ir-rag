# Composite control arm apparatus.

## Abstract
Composite control arm 50 replaces a control arm 12 , a spring 8 and bushes in the suspension of an automative vehicle. Different embodiments of composite control arm include two materials bonded together, with one material 60 providing primarily dimensional integrity and the other material 80,90 providing primarily springiness or flexibility so that the two functions are combined in a single composite element. The control arm is rigidly fixed 52, 54 to the chassis at one end and has a varying cross section over its length and breadth to define its flexibility.
