# ROTARY POWER TRANSMISSION

## Abstract
A rotary power transmission has gear trains each being one of a set providing a series of increasing speed ratios, and two clutches 13, 14 independently operable and providing alternative drive paths through the gear trains between a common input 11 and a common output 21 the gear trains of alternate ratios in the set are driven respectively through one and the other clutch, a hydrodynamic coupling 12 being provided in series with the clutch 14 of the odd speed ratios only.
