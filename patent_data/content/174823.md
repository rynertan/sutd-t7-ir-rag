## Description
The invention relates to apparatus for manufacturing electrical harnesses automatically, and more particularly, to fully automatic apparatus for manufacturing electrical harnesses of the kind which comprise a plurality of wires cut to desired lengths and a multi contact type connector attached to the wires at one end thereof. Recently semi automatic or fully automatic apparatus for producing such harnesses has been developed, typical examples of which are disclosed in Japanese Patent Kokai unexamined Publication No. 58 1983 145080, U.S. Patent No. 4,136,440 and U.S. Patent No. 4,310,967. The finished electrical harness has its connector free end covered with an insulation covering, which must be removed so as to enable the electrical conductors to be connected to circuits and instruments. To remove the insulation covering automatically, a stripping device is additionally provided in the system for making electrical harnesses. Under the conventional system, however, the stripping device is located adjacent to the connector assembling device, and the stripping process is carried out independently of the connector attaching process, the wire length measuring process and others. If full automation in making electrical harnesses is to be achieved, it is required for the stripping process to be carried out at the same time as the wire length measuring process is performed since this can considerably shorten the operation time. According to the invention there is provided apparatus for making electrical harnesses comprising wires and electrical connectors, the apparatus comprising The apparatus of the invention can be fully automatic and includes a stripping device provided in the wire length measuring device so that the wire length measuring process and the insulation covering stripping process can be simultaneously carried out. The invention is diagrammatically illustrated by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring to the drawings and firstly to Figure 1, apparatus for manufacturing electrical harnesses includes a wire supplying device 10 which supplies wires 2 horizontally in parallel by means of a bundling device 5, the wires 2 being supplied along a wire feed path W through a straightener 6 and a feed roller 7. A connector attaching device 11 is provided for attaching connectors 3 to the ends of the wires 2 by means of a punch 21 and a die 22 disposed on opposite sides of the wire feed path W, the punch and die having a cutting blade 23 located adjacent thereto. A connector supplying device not shown supplies connectors to the die 22 one by one. A first movable chuck 12 carries the wires 2 supplied to the connector attaching device 11 along the wire feed path W for a desired distance, whereby the desired length of the wires 2 is determined, and a second movable chuck 13 holds the wires 2 horizontally at equal intervals in parallel and guides the wires 2 to the connector assembling device 11 at which the second chuck 13 adjusts the positions of the wire ends. The second chuck 13 reciprocally moves in a predetermined relatively small range. The apparatus further includes a third movable chuck 14 provided between the second chuck 13 and the connector attaching device 11 and movable in a predetermined range along the wire feed path W. A device for determining the lengths of insulation covering to be stripped, hereinafter referred to as the stripping length varying device 15, is located between the second and third chucks 13 and 14. A stripping device 17, for removing the insulation covering of the wires 2, is mounted on the first chuck 12. The connector supplying device includes a conventional hopper feeder and magazine, the description of which will be omitted for simplicity. The punch 21 is mounted on a slider 25 which can be raised and lowered by means of a pneumatic cylinder 24, and is lowered from the raised position shown in Figure 2 to the lowered position shown in Figures 3 and 4 to cause the connectors to be attached to the wire ends. The cutting blade 23 is also mounted on the slider 25, and is operated by means of a pneumatic cylinder 26 fixed to the slider 25, independently of the punch 21. The cutting blade 23 cuts the wires in cooperation with a cutting die 27 at the preparatory position for connector attaching. In addition, the slider 25 has a wire chuck 28 for holding the wires at the moment of connector attaching, and a wire guide 29. The die 22 is mounted on a slider 30, which can be raised and lowered step by step by means of a first pneumatic cylinder 31 and a second cylinder 32 coupled to the first cylinder 31 through a joint 33 in such a manner that they can move together. The die 22 moves together with the slider 30 and, in operation, the die 22 is raised from the position shown in Figure 2 together with the slider 30 by means of the first pneumatic cylinder 31 until it reaches the preparatory position for connector attaching shown in Figure 3. From the preparatory position it is further raised to the position shown in Figure 4 where the connectors are attached to the wire ends. A connector presser 34 is provided at the release side of the die 22, the connector presser 34 securing the connector 3 under the pressure of a spring not shown . The connector presser 34 has a further wire chuck 35 located adjacent thereto, which mates with the wire chuck 28 The wire chuck 35 is operated by means of a pneumatic cylinder 36 mounted on the slider 30, independently of the die 22 it is raised from the preparatory position shown in Figure 3, and by working in association with the wire chuck 28, grips the group of wires 2A which have been pulled out to a desired length by the first chuck 12. As shown in Figure 5, the first chuck 12 includes a movable frame 40, and two pneumatic cylinders 41, 42 fixed to the movable frame 40. The two pneumatic cylinders 41 and 42 are coaxially provided and the piston rod 44 of the cylinder 42 passes through a piston rod 43 of the cylinder 41. A pair of arms 45 are pivotally attached to the movable frame 40 at their middle portions by pivot pins 46. Each arm 45 is provided with a chuck tooth 47 at its free end, and with a link 48 at its tail end, the link 48 being connected to the piston rod 43 to that the chuck teeth 47 can be opened and closed by operation of the pneumatic cylinder 41. The movable frame 40 can be reciprocally moved along the wire feed path W. The stripping device 17 mounted on the first chuck 12 includes a pair of sliders 50, and a stripping blade 51 fixed at the free end of each slider 50. Each slider 50 is slidably engaged in a dovetail groove 52 provided in an inner side of a respective one of the arms 45, and links 53 fixed to inner end portions of the sliders 50 are coupled to a connecting member 54 mounted on the free end of the piston rod 44. The sliders 50 can thus be reciprocally moved along the dovetail grooves 52 by means of the pneumatic cylinder 42. The sliders 50 move with the arms 45 so that as the chuck teeth 47 open or close the stripping blades 51 are opened and closed. The second chuck 13 can be opened and closed by means of a pneumatic cylinder 55, and can be reciprocally moved along the wire feed path W between the full line position and the dotted line position shown in Figure 1, a relatively small range, by a pneumatic cylinder 56. The third chuck 14 can be opened and closed by means of a pneumatic cylinder 58 and is movable along the wire feed path W as shown in Figure 1 by a pneumatic cylidner 59. Reference numerals 57 and 60 denote wire guides. The stripping length varying device 15 includes a plurality of varying plates 61 which are arranged laterally in such a manner that one plate corresponds to one wire and which are individually capable of ascending and descending a pneumatic cylinder 62 for moving the varying plates 61 up and down, and a pair of guide rollers 63, the pair of guide rollers 63 and the varying plate 61 being disposed on opposite respective sides of the wire feed path W. The reference numeral 64 denotes a straightener located adjacent to the stripping length varying device 15, so as to straighten up the wires bent by the varying plates 61. The wire length varying device 16 includes a plurality of varying plates 65 a pneumatic cylinder 66 for moving the varying plates 65 up and down, and guide rollers 67, which are provided on a carrier 68 which can be moved up and down by means of a pneumatic cylinder 69. This enables the guide rollers 67 to descend below the path of the first chuck 12, thereby allowing the first chuck 12 to pass safely above the rollers 67. An example of the operation will be described with reference to Figure 8 Then, the first chuck 12 is operated, and grips the free ends of the wires 2 by means of the chuck teeth 47. At the same time the stripping blades 51 slit the insulation coverings of the wires. Figure 8 d The first chuck 12 is advanced along the wire feed path W to pull the wires to a desired length. During the pulling travel the stripping device 17 is operated to move the stripping blades 51 way from the chuck teeth 47, thereby stripping the insulation covering off the conductor. Figure 8 e As best shown in Figures 6 and 7, the lengths of the stripped conductors vary, which is derived from the fact that the position of the top ends of the wires 2 are differentiated in accordance with the lengths to be stripped. Then, the connector attaching device 11 is operated As shown in Figure 10, a harness 9 has its wires 2A cut to predetermined lengths, and provided with one connector 3 at one end, with the other ends being free from a connector and having varying lengths of stripped conductors. A harness 9₁ shown in Figure 11 can be formed by slackening the wires by means of the varying plates 65 in the manner shown in Figure 9 a and b . A harness 9₂ shown in Figure 12 can be formed by using neither of the stripping length varying device 15 and the wire length varying device 16.
