## Description
The invention relates to a spreadable water in oil emulsion, based on a high melting butter fat fraction and a liquid oil, as well as to a process for its preparation. The preparation of a similar product, starting from cream and a vegetable oil, including a churning step, has been described in British Patent Specification 1 217 395. According to this patent specification a maximum amount of 30 of vegetable oil, based on the total amount of fat, can be included in the product, since higher concentrations of oil result in a product having too soft a consistency at room temperature. There is a need for a spreadable emulsion including if possible a reduced amount of the expensive butterfat and an increased amount of oil, preferably vegetable oil having a high content on unsaturated fatty acids which have a favourable physiological effect, with the further object of obtaining a better spreadability at temperatures ranging from 5 20 C than that of conventional products. It was found that a spreadable w o emulsion can be prepared that satisfies these requirements. The emulsion according to the invention comprises The above mentioned solid fat contents have been measured as N values according to the methods described in Journal of the American Oil Chemists Society, The liquid oil consists preferably of a vegetable oil containing a relatively high level of polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as sunflower oil, soybean oil, safflower oil, cottonseed oil, rapeseed oil, corn oil, groundnut oil, or mixtures thereof. It is also possible to use other vegetable or animal oils or low melting fractions. The butter stearine is a fraction obtained by the fractionation of butter in the presence of a solvent such as acetone or hexane, or in the presence of a surface active substance so called Lanza fractionation or in the absence of a solvent so called dry fractionation . Preferably the butter stearin is a fraction obtained by the dry fractionation of butter, as the use of solvents in dissolving the purifying oil causes part of the flavours to disappear when the solvent is removed. The dry fractionation is carried out at a temperature ranging from 15 to 30 C, preferably from 23 to 28 C. The butter stearin obtained by dry fractionation preferably has the following solid fat contents, expressed in N values The ratios between the components of the fatty phase of the emulsion are such as to impart to said phase the following solid fat contents To satisfy these criteria, the fatty phase will contain 20 65 wt of butter stearin and 35 80 wt , preferably 40 65 wt of liquid oil. The emulsions according to the invention may also contain a certain amount of non fractionated butterfat these emulsions preferably comprise a fatty phase having the following composition butter stearin 20 65 , liquid oil 35 80 and non fractionated butterfat 0 45 , it being understood that the sum of the quantities by weight of the three components has to be 100 . This non fractionated butter is preferably present in a dispersed form in the aqueous phase, which may further contain emulsifiers such as mono or di glycerides, lecithin, thickeners, proteins and water soluble salts. The pH preferably lies between 4.5 and 5.5. The aqueous phase preferably contains 1 10 wt of milk protein, based on the final product. A preferred aqueous phase is bacteriologically acidified skim milk. As a rule the aqueous phase constitutes about 16 wt of the total composition. In principle however, the emulsions may be of the low calorie type and constitute about 16 wt , for example 30 70 wt of the total composition. The process according to the invention for preparing the emulsion as defined above comprises The butterfat is prepared in a manner known per se, for example starting from cream which is converted into butter, followed by separation of the butter serum, or directly by centrifugation of cream. The butterfat is liquefied by heating it up to a temperature above melting point. Preferably a temperature is chosen which does not exceed 10 C above melting point. This maximum heating temperature will in most cases approximate 45 C. Ideally, the butterfat is brought to a temperature ranging from 35 to 40 C. The fractionation conditions have already been described above. For the preparation of the spreadable product it is possible to dose the fatty and aqueous phases separately into an apparatus in which the cooling and working are effected. It is also possible first to prepare a preemulsion, which is subsequently fed to the apparatus. Cooling and working of the emulsion can be carried out in a so called Votator apparatus, consisting of one or more scraped surface coolers in which the emulsion is rapidly deep cooled, and stirring vessels provided with pins in which post crystallisation can take place. Apparatus of this type is described in Andersen Williams Margarine , Pergamon Press, 2nd Ed., 1965. According to another embodiment of the invention a cream is prepared starting from a mixture of butter stearin, liquid oil and optionally non fractionated butterfat, which is injected into water or into diluted or non diluted skim milk, followed by churning of the mixture, if desired after addition of a further amount of tat, particularly liquid oil. The invention will now be illustrated by means of the following Examples Butterfat was prepared, starting from cream having a fat content of 38 , by centrifugation, followed by separation of the butterfat. Butterfat was heated to 40 C and subsequently cooled 3 C h to 25 C. The stearin obtained had the following characteristics The fatty phase was prepared by mixing at 40 C The fat mixture has the following characteristics An aqueous phase 16 pH 4.7 , containing acidified skim milk, was emulsified in the above mentioned fatty phase 84 , in which 0.1 of monoglyceride had been incorporated. The spread was prepared by feeding the pre emulsion to Votator units according to the following scheme A A C A, in which a so called A unit the pre emulsions were rapidly cooled and worked and post crystallisation took place in the so called C unit. The residence time in the A unit was 20 30 sec. and in the C unit about 2 min. On emerging from the first A unit the emulsion had a temperature of 15 C on emerging from the second A unit this temperature was 10 C. On emerging from the C unit the emulsion temperature was 13 C and on emerging from the third A unit 10 C. The hardness, expressed in C values determination according to Haighton et al Journal of American Oil Chemists Society The product was excellently spreadable at 5 and 20 C. The process prescribed according to Example I was repeated, except that the fractionation was carried out at 15 C, resulting in a stearin having the following solid fat contents A fatty phase was prepared starting from 60 of stearin and 40 of sunflower oil. The solid fat contents were as follows The spread emerging from the Votator had the following characteristics The product was eminently spreadable at 10 and 20 C. The process prescribed according to Example I was repeated, except that the fatty phase had been prepared starting from 60 of soybean oil and 40 of stearin. The fat mixture had the following percentages of solid fat The spread emerging from the Votator had the following characteristics The product was eminently spreadable at 5 and at 20 C. The process prescribed according to Example I for the preparation of the butter stearin was repeated. A fatty phase was prepared. starting from 40 parts of butterfat, 20 parts of butter stearin and 20 parts of sunflower oil. Subsequently an artificial cream was prepared by injecting this fatty phase into 60 parts of skim milk and 60 parts of water. This artificial cream was allowed to stand overnight at 10 C. Subsequently 20 parts of sunflower oil were added and the pre emulsion was churned until, besides skim milk, a product with the desired texture and plasticity was obtained. The product was eminently spreadable at 10 and 20 C. A pre emulsion was prepared, starting from the aqueous phase of Example I and a fatty phase consisting of 40 of sunflower oil and 60 of non fractionated butterfat, and was treated according to the process prescribed in Example I. The product thus obtained had the following C values At 15 and 20 C the product had no measurable C value and it was substantially liquid.
