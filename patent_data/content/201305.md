# Smooth, low friction magnetic recording medium.

## Abstract
Flexible magnetic recording media such as videotapes based on ferromagnetic oxide particles can provide high carrier to noise ratios previously available only with metal powder tapes when the recording layer has a high loading at least 74 by weight of oxide particles which have a high sur face area at least 40 mÂ² g and includes free monobasic fatty acid comprising more than 1.5 by weight of the ferromagnet ic oxide particles. The free fatty acid provides a coefficient of friction not exceeding 0.3. A preferred monobasic fatty acid is myristic acid. By incorporating into the bilder a lubricant adsorption inhibitor such as citric acid, a greater proportion of the fatty acid remains free.
