# Highway train.

## Abstract
In a highway train a wheeled and steerable, motor driven vehicle 1 is combined at least with a first load carrier 3 having its forward end portion rested on a first fifth wheel 2 supported by the rear portion of the tractive vehicle 1 , an auxiliary wheeled vehicle 6 having a front portion 6A with a second fifth wheel 27 supporting the rearward end portion of the first load carrier 3 , a second load carrier 3 having its forward end portion rested on a third fifth wheel 9 supported by a rear portion 68 of the auxiliary vehicle 6 , and an additional wheeled vehicle 10 supporting the rear end portion of the second load carrier 3 , the first load carrier 3 being en route supported solely by the first and second fifth wheels 2, 27 in a manner to be free to occupy a limited angular position in a generally horizontal plane relative to both the tractive vehicle 1 and the auxiliary vehicle 6 . The auxiliary vehicle 6 has fixed front wheels 7 and rear wheels 8 which by means of a steering mechanism are turned in response to any horizontal angular displacement occurring between the first load carrier 3 and the auxiliary vehicle 6 when the train passes through a curve and this in such manner that the auxiliary vehicle 6 will always seek itself back to a position in a straight line with the first load carrier.
