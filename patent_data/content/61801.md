# Imaging devices and systems.

## Abstract
In a thermal radiation imaging device a plurality of photoconductive detector elements 1, 6, 7 and 8 are present on a common substrate 2 , e.g. of sapphire. Each detector element comprises a strip 1 , e.g. of n type cadmium mercury telluride, on which biasing electrode means 6 and 7 , e.g. of gold are spaced for causing a bias current predominantly of majority charge carriers to flow along each strip 1 . The bias current supports an ambipolar drift of radiation generated charge carriers in the opposite direction. Read out means for detecting these carriers comprises a connection 8 protruding from one side of the strip 1 , while from the opposite side a recess 9 extends across part of the width of the strip 1 . The connection 8 of one strip extends into the recess 9 of an adjacent strip so that a compact, closely spaced and substantially aligned arrangement of the parallel detector elements 1, 6, 7 and 8 can be obtained. Advantageous read out characteristics can also result from the narrowing of the drift path by the recess 9 which constricts the bias current and increases the electric field in the read out area. An increase in responsivity and a shor tened effective read out length can be obtained.
