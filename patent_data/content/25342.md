# Apparatus for extracting water from ambient air.

## Abstract
Apparatus for extracting water from moisture laden ambient air comprises a plurality of chambers 1a packed with an adsorbent 4 for moisture in the air means 11,12,13 for bringing one or more of the chambers 1a into and out of register with a first and second desorbing section 25,26 and means 16 for passing ambient air through the chambers not in register with said sections, whereby moisture from the ambient air is adsorbed on the adsorbent 4 and subse quently removed from the adsorbent 4 in each chamber 1a as that chamber 1a is brought into register with the said desorbing sections 25,26 a recycling duct 18 connecting the second section 26 to the first 25 to complete a desorp tion circuit, means 19 for circulating air through said circuit to remove water from the adsorbent means 20 for heating the air in the circuit and means 22 for removing water from the circuit. The ratio of the number of chambers 1a in register with the desorbing sections 24,25 to the number of cham bers 1a receiving moisture laden air can be varied according to the temperature and moisture context of the ambient air.
