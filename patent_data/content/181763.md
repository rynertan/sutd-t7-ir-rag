# ACTUATOR EMERGENCY OPERATION

## Abstract
Electrical circuit configurations are described for the operation of an electrically powered actuator in an emer gency to drive the actuator to a predetermined position. In particular the actuator is connected to apply friction brakes of a railway vehicle. The configurations have in common are emergency power circuit connected between an emergency power source and the actuator, means for breaking the power circuit when the actuator reaches the emergency position and latching means to prevent run back. Preferably and in order to minimise size and weight the emergency power source is of limited capacity, sufficient for, say, two such emergency applications and is recharged from a normal power supply the recharging circuit being interlock ed with the latching means such that the actuator may not be released from the emergency position unless the power source has sufficient charge for at least one further emer gency operation.
