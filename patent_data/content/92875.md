## Description
PROCESS OF PREPARING ALKYLPOLYSACCHARIDES Technical Field and Background Art This invention relates to an improved process for making alkylpolysaccharides in which the alkyl group contains from about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms and the polysaccharide chain contains from about If to about 20 saccharide units on the average. Tl e imp roved process gives a good polysaccharide chain length distribution and a good color. The process can be used to prepare highly efficient alkylpolysaccharides useful as detelagel1t surfactants and foam builders for anionic detergent surfactants. Summary of the Invention The present invention relates to a process for prepariny a long chain alkyl polysaccharide comprising the essential step of reacting a short chain alkylsaccharide of a reducing saccharide containing from about five to about six carbon atoms in which the alkyl contains from one to about five carbon atoms with a long chain fatty alcohol containing from about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms at a reaction temperature of from about 9OO to about 1200C ill the presence of an acid catalyst, the resulting short chain alcohol being removed, preferably under a vacuum, and preferably as rapidly as possible, with the catalyst being destroyed by adding an alkaiine material after at least about 90 of the short chain alkyl saccharide has been destroyed, the extent of destruc tiun can be determined by measuring the resulting short chain alcohol which has been removed, or, preferably, by measuring the percent of water in the distillate, and before the average polysaccharide chain length exceeds about 20, preferably before the length exceeds about 4, most preferably before the length cx ceeds about 3. In a second highly preferred step the unreacted long chain fatty alcohol in the product from the above step is removed by applying a vacuum and heat to a thin film of the product of the first step whereby the unreacted fatty alcohol is reduced to a level of less than about 2 , preferably less than about µ , The combination of the above two steps can be used to provide a superior alkylpolysaccharide for use as a detergent surfactant in which the alkyl group contains from about 12 to about 18, preferably from about 12 to about lil carbon atoms, the average polysaccharide chain length is from about 1µ to about 3, preferably from about 1.6 to about 2 3 il saccharide units, the level of short chain alkylsaccharide and polysaccharlde Is less than about 10 , the amount of alkylpolysaccharlde in which the saccharide chain length is 6 or greater is less than about 10 , preferably less than about 5 , the alkylmonosaccharide content is less than about 60 , preferably less than about 50 , and the unreacted fatty alcohol content is less than about 28, preferably less than about µt Detailed Description of the invention The fatty alcohols useful herein may be primary or secondary alcohols having straight or branched chains which can be either saturated or unsaturated, and may contain ether linkages.Preferably, the alcohols are primary saturated alcohols. Examples include dodecyl, tridecyl, tetradecyl, pentadecyl, hexadecyl, and octadecyl alcohols, and mixtures thereof. The preferred fatty alcohols are those containing from about 12 to about 14 carbon atoms The short chain alkylmonosaccharides, are e.g., the methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, and pentyl, preferably propyl or butyl, and most preferably butyl, fructosides, glucosides, mannosides, galactosides, talosides, allosides, altrosides, idosides, arabinosides, xylosides, lyxosides, ribosides, and mixtures thereof.The preferred alkylmonosaccharides are glucosides and fructosides due to their availability and low cost, and the most preferred alkylmonosaccharide is derived from glucose. These compounds can be prepared separately, in a preliminary step, or as part of the first step since the corrcsponding short chain alcohols react with the corresponding reducing saccharides conlaining from five to six carbon atoms much faster than the long chain fatty alcohols react.Saccharides containing six carbon atoms are preferred The molar ratio of the long chain fatty alcohol to the short chain alkylmonosaccharide is between about 1 4 and about 4 1, preferably between about 1 2 and about 2 1, most preferably between about 1 1 and about 1.2 1. The level of long chain fatty alcohol is preferably kept as low as possible to facilitate the removal of unreacted fatty alcohol from the desired alkyl polysaccharide. An auxiliary solvent can be used to maintain fluidity.The lower levels of fatty alcohol also maximize the formation of the desired long chain alkylpolysaccharides especially at levels above about 608. Preferably the level of long chain alkylmonosaccharide in the finished product is less than about 60 , most preferably less than about 50 . The reaction is carried out at a temperature of from about 900C to about 120 C, preferably above about 100 C. Above about 1200C there is excessive formation of colored materials and excessively fast saccharide chain growth. However, the reaction temperature should be as high as possible to minimize the time of the reaction. If an auxiliary solvent is used, it should have a boiling point that will permit its easy removal for recycling. It should also be compatible with the short chain alcohol, the long chain alcohol, the saccharide and the alkyl saccharides and should not be reactive. Suitable auxiliary solvents include toluene, C8 12 hydrocarbons, etc. It is desirable that the resulting product contain a minimum of the short chain alkylsaccharides, which do not provide any substantial detergency benefits. However, care must be taken in removing the last amount of the short chain alcohol since this normally requires more stringent conditions and one wants to avoid removal of the long chain alcohol. Furthermore, if the reaction proceeds for too long a time, the average polysaccharide chain length becomes too long. Increasiny the reaction time can be used to achieve longer polysaccharide chains since free sac charide reacts with the end of the saccharide chain preferentially as compared to the fatty alcohol.Accordingly, it is desirable to remove the short chain fatty alcohol rapidly and kill the catalyst by adding an alkaline material as soon as the desired product is achieved. Known analytical techniques can be used to determine the structures of the alkylpolysaccharide surfactants herein for example, to determine the saccharide chain length, the amount of butyl glucoside, the free fatty alcohol content, and the level of unreacted polysaccharide. More specifically, gas or liquid chro matography can be used to determine the unreacted alcohol content and the unreacted polysaccharlde content respectively.Proton nmr can be used to determine the average saccharlde chain length. The point of attachment of the hydrophilic portion of the molecule to the hydrophobic portion of the molecule can be determined by 13C nmr. The alkylpolysaccharide stirfactants are complex mixtures.Their components vary depending upon the nature of the starting materials and the reaction by which they are preapred. Jinalyt ical standards which are useful in calibrating instruments for analyzing the components of a particular alkylpolysaccharide surfactant can be obtained from Calbiochem Behrinjc Co. I aJolla,California These standards include those for octylglucoside Calbiochem num 494559 , decylglucoside Calbiochem num 252715 . and dodecylmaltoside Calbiochem jt324355 5 , The combination of vacuum and temperature should not remove the long chain alcohol.Preferably the reaction takes place in a thin film, preferably at high Reynolds numbers 720,000 , as set forth hereinafter, to permit rapid removal of the short chain alcohol which results, and preferably the reaction takes place under a vacuum to assist in the rapid removal of the resulting short chain alcohol. Thin films can be achieved using, preferably, a wiped film evaporator or a drum evaporator, or mills in which two cylinders combine to form a thin film, etc. In a mill it is desirable that one of the cylinders rotate faster than the other to impart a shearing and mixing action. The reaction mix is conveniently removed from a drum or cylinder by a doctor blade. The length of the saccharide chain is primarily controlled by adjusting the ratio of the saccharide monomer to the fatty alcohol.For any given ratio there Is a desired end point at which time the desired reaction is complete and beyond that point one effects undesired dehydration of the saccharide moieties. The synthesis process can be monitored by following the percent of water contained in the distillate. The distillate contains mainly lower fatty alcohol and long chain fatty alcohols. The water level can be analyzed by collecting the distillate in fractions and titrating it with Karl Fischer reagent. The optimum end point is at the lowest water level in the distillate, preferably 0.1 . Further reaction increases the glycoside chain length rapidly and can make the product unsuitable for, e.g., detergent applications. An in line moisture monitor is ideal to control the process. In one reaction in which the initial molar ratio of butyl glycoside to C1 2 13 fatty alcohol was about 3, the temperature was about 1180C and the pressure varied from about one cm. ofHg to one atomosphere, the percent water in the distillate varied with the amount of distillate collected as follows Distillate ml 50 140 270 320 360 375 380 396 H2O 12.4 4.1 0.9 0.2 0.08 0.25 0.3 0.15 The desired end point occurs when the percent of water in the distillate is less than about 0.2, preferably less than about 0.1, most preferably less than about 0.08. The acid catalysts can be any of the conventional acids such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, phosphorus acid, toluene sulfonic acid, etc., and other Lewis acid catalysts, etc. The amount of acid catalyst used is between about 0.0001 mole per mole of saccharide monomer and about 0.02 mole per mole of saccharide monomer1 preferably between about 0.005 and about 0.01, most preferably between about 0.001 and about 0.006. The amount of catalyst used can control the speed of reaction. When larger amounts of catalysts are used the neutralized catalyst should be one that is compatible with the end use of the sur factant. Sulfuric acid is the preferred catalyst. Removal of the Fatty Alcohol The fatty alcohol can be removed from the product of the first step by distillation or by a solvent extraction technique.The fatty alcohol and any auxiliary solvent are removed after the catalyst has been destroyed by neutralizatlon. The preferred method of fatty alcohol removal Is to form a thin film of the reaction product containing the neutralized catalyst and apply heat and a vacuum. A wiped film evaporator Is a particularly preferred piece of equipment for removing the fatty alcohol.Although the prior art represented by German OLS, 3,001,064 has described the problem associated with removing fatty alcohol from an alkyl polysaccharide without causing an increase In the color,It has now been found that the use of a thin film evaporator and a vacuum permits the removal of the fatty alcohols and or solvent of this invention to a level below about 28 and even below about 1 296 without any appreciable change in the color of the product.This discovery is especially important when one is preparing alkylpolysaccharides from alcohols containing more than 10 carbon atoms where the boiling point of the fatty alcohol, even under a high vacuum, is very high and prolonged exposure to high temperature leads to decomposition of the polysaccharide. With alkyl polysaccharides in which the alkyl group contains more than 10 carbon atoms, it is preferred to have a small amount of short chain alkyl C1 5 saccharide present to maintain the fluidity thus allowing lower temperatures to be used. In the removal process of this invention the product is formed into a thin film at a temperature of from about 1200C. to about 2000C., preferably from about 140 C. to about 1800C,, most preferably from about 1600C. to about 1700C. and under a vacuum of from about O.lmmHg to about 20mmHg, preferably from about O.lmmHg to about 5mmHg, most preferably from about 0,1mmHçl to about 3mmHg. The thin film during the reaction and the removal steps is preferably formed in a thin film evaporator which gives a film with a thickness of from about Imm to about lOmm and aReynolds number of at least about 20,000, preferably at least about 50,000, and more preferably about 100,000. The film in such evaporator is preferably less than about Smm at its thinnest and more preferably less than about 5mm in the wave. Preferred Product The process defined hereinbefore can be used to prepare a preferred alkylpolysaccharide detergent surfactant having super lor properties with respect to detergency and suds boosting for other detergent surfactants. This preferred alkylpolysaccharide has the formula RO Z is which R is an alkyl group containing from about 10 to about 18 carbon atoms Z represents a 5 or 6, preferably 6, carbon member reducing sacdiaride moiety x averages from about 1.6 to about 2 314 the amount of alkylpolysaccharide in which x is greater than 6 Is less than about 10 , preferably less than about 58 the amount of the alkylpolysaccharide in which x Is 1 Is less than about 608, preferably less than about 50 , and the defined material is associated with no more than about 10 alkylsaccharides and polysaccharides wherein the alkyl group contains less than about 8 carbon atoms and with no more than about 2 alcohol containing an R group. Preferably in the above compound R is a straight chain saturated alkyl group and preferably the R groups contain from about 12 to about 14 carbon atoms. An even more preferred average of x is from about 1.7 to about 2.5. The preferred Z group is a glucoside group. The above preferred alkylpolysaccharide preferably consti tutes at least about 90 of the all ylpolysacchal ide material present. It is difficult to achieve an alliylpolysaccharide having the appropriate alkyl chain length and average x without either exceeding the desired amount of fatty alcohol or monosaccharide on the one hand, or providing excess material in which x exceeds 6 on the other hand. It is also difficult to maintain a good color in alkyl polysaccharide detergent surfactants to permit their incorporation into detergent compositions, and to minimize the amount of short chain alkylpolysaccharide present. The process described hereinbefore achieves the desired product by minimizing the temperature to which the material is exposed, especially while an acid catalyst is present maximizing the speed at which the short chain alcohol is removed killing the catalyst as soon as the desired end point has been reached and then removing the fatty alcohol, preferably by a process which minimizes the time and the temperature to which the desired product Is exposed. Surprisingly, It has been discovered that the increase in the alkyl chain length from 10 to 12 results In a very large decrease in the reactivity of the fatty alcohol. It also Increases considerably the difficulty involved In removing the fatty alcohol without exceeding the decomposition temperature of the polysaccharide chain. The combination process disclosed herein achieves the desired product. The importance of the limits on the preferred alkylpolysaccharide detergent surfactant are documented hereinafter in the examples. In order to obtain maximum performance, x needs to be as low as possible while maintaining water solubility. The desired products have an HLB of from about 7 to about 30, preferably from about 10 to about 20, and a critical micelle concentration of from about 10 ppm to about 1000 ppm, preferably from about 20 ppm to about 500 ppm. EXAMPLE I 50ml of n butanol, log anhydrous glucose, 20ml n dodecanol and 0.05349 of p toluene sulfonic acid were added to a looms 3 neck flask with stirring. The reaction mixture was refluxed at 115 1170C for 2 hours. The n butanol was then removed as fast as possible with the help of partial vacuum while keeping the temperature at 100 C, to 1200C. The reaction was kept at 120 C, 5cm Hg vacuum for 40 minutes. 0,027g of Na2CO3 was used to neutralize the reaction mixture. The unreacted n dodecanol was then distilled off using a Wiped Film Evaporator by Pope at a temperature of 1650C and a vacuum of 2 mm Hg.The final sample is a crispy solid with the following analyses In the following, e.g., dodecanol polyglycoside with n glucose moieties is abbreviatedC12Cn . Average glucose number per alkyl chain 2.0, weight percent of n butyl oligoglycoside 5.9 , C12, C1 40 , C12 G2 218, C12 G3 13 , C12 G4 9.8 , C12 G5 8 , C12 C6, IOt, C12 OH 0.116 . EXAMPLE II 500ml n butanol, 48g anhydrous glucose, 200 ml Neodol 23 and 0.0534g of p toluene sulfonic acid were reacted. The reaction was carried out in a lOOOml flask with vigorous stirring.After n butanol removal, reaction condition was set at 1180C, 2cmHg vacuum until 103 of the added n butanol volume was collected. Water After neutralizing In the usual manner, the sample was dried, as in Example I, through the wiped film evaporator. The product was analyzed to be average glycoside number per alkyl chain 2.0, weight percent of n butyl oligoglycoside 1 , C12,13 G1 C12,13 G2 19 , C12,13 G3 11.5 ,C12,3 G4 8.4 , C12,13 G5 4.44 , C12,13 G6 3.85 . EXAMPLE Ill 500 ml n butanol, 1929 anhydrous dextrose, 200 ml Neodol 23 and 0.05349 p toluene sulfonic acid. The reaction was carried out in the same manner as Example II. The final product was analyzed to be average glucose number per alkyl chain 2,5,C12,13 G1 35 , C12,13 G2 20 ., C12,13 G3 15 , C12,13 G4 12.68, C12,13 G5 9.8 , C12,13G6 6 7.6 . COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE IV 480g anhydrous dextrose, 6.0g p toluene sulfonic acid, 960g Neodol 23 C12 13 fatty alcohol and 3600ml n butanol were refluxed at 1170C for 1 hour. The n butanol was distilled off under atmospheric pressure for 45 minutes at 1200C. The pres sure was reduced gradually to 50mm Hg and the temperature was maintained at 1300C for 1.5 hours. The reaction mixture was neutralized with 3g sodium carbonate in 20ml H2O. The excess alcohol was washed away with acetone. The product had the following analyses 27 butyl polyglycosides, 10.2 cjlLicose units per molecule. This indicated the temperature was too high and too much catalyst was used. This favored the polysaccharide chain length polymerization without removing the butyl polyglycosides. EXAMPLE V 96g anhydrous dextrose, 200ml Neodol 23 C1213 fatty alcohol , 0,9g p toluene sulfonic acid and 500ml n butanol were refluxed for 2 hours. 95 of the n butanol was then removed by distillation at 1150C t 50C under vacuum. The resulting mixture was then passed through a Pope 2 inch Wiped Film Evaporator twice, operated at 1200C, and 2cm Hg pressure. The reaction mixture before the removal of excess fatty alcohol was the following composition alkyl polyglycoside 51 , average glucose per molecule 2.0, butyl polyglycosides 58. EXAMPLE VI 400g anhydrous dextrose, 800ml Neodol 91 C9 11 fatty alcohol , 1 6g p toluene sulfonic acid and 2000ml n butanol were refluxed for 2 hours. 95 of the butanol was then removed under the same conditions as in Example V. The reaction mixture was passed through a Pope Wiped Film Evaporator twice, the resulting mixture contains alkyl polyglycoside 4896, average glucose per molecule 1.6, butyl polyglycoside 38. Wiped Film Evaporator Examples EXAMPLE VII 960g anhydrous dextrose, 2000ml Neodol 23, 5000ml n butanol and 1. 2y concentrated sulfuric acid were refluxed at 1170C for 2 hours. n butanol was then removed at 1170C, 2cm Hg pressure.The reaction mixture was neutralized with Na2CO3 solution. The excess Neodol 23 was then removed by a 2 inch Pope Wiped FilmEvaporator operated at 160 1700C, 2mm Hg pressure. The solution residence time in the hot zone was approximately 1 minute.The resulting product had a light brown color. Melting point about 1300C. It was cooled to room temperature and was easily ground into a yellowish powder. Analyses showed a content of 0.4596 Neodol 23. It dissolved readily in water and gave a yellowish clear solution. EXAMPLE VIII lOOg anhydrous dextrose, 200ml Neodol 91, 500ml n butanol and O.lg concentrated sulfuric acid were refluxed at 1170C for 2 hours. n butanol was then removed at 1170C and 2cm Hg pressure. After neutralization by Na2C03, the reaction mixture was passed through a 2 inch Pope Wiped Film Evaporator. The oper acting conditions were 155 1650C and 2mm Hg pressure, A product containing 0.2 Neodol 91 was obtained. EXAMPLE IX The same reaction as In Example VIII was carried out except 400my Neodol 23 was used In place of Neodol 91. The reaction mixture was passed twice through the Pope Wiped Film Evaporator at 165 170 C and 2mm Hg pressure. The product contained 0.4X Neodol 23. EXAMPLE X 420 ml of 1 butanol, 0.7 g p toluene sulfonic acid, 57g methyl a D glucopyranoside and 25g methyl B D glucopyranoside were added to a one liter, 3 neck flask. The above mixture was refluxed at 116 1180C. After 2 3 hours of refluxing, the boiling point of the mixture dropped to 1090C. 230ml of a mixture of dodecanol and tridecanol was added. The mixture was allowed to boil at 1180C and the distillate collected. Methanol was collected first, followed by butanol. Vacuum was slowly increased to give a steady rate of distillation without letting the temperature rise above 1200C. The level of moisture contained in the distillate was measured by Karl Fischer titration. The reaction was stopped when the moisture level dropped to below 0.1 in the distillate.0.27g Na2CO3 dissolved in 3ml water were added to neutralize the catalyst. The reaction mixture was then purified by removing excess dodecanol and tridecanol using a Kugelrohr distillation apparatus. Aldrich Cat. No. 210,046 3 . The resulting cake was ground to give a biege colored powder. Analysis gave 2.0 average glycoside units per molecule, 8.0 butyl oligoglycosldes and no methyl glucosides. EXAMPLE XI 500ml 1 butanol, 1009 galactose, O.5g p toluene sulfonic acid were added to a one liter 3 necked flask. The mixture was refluxed at 116 1180C until clear. About 280ml butanol was then removed through distillation. 400ml of a mixture of dodecanol and tridecanol was added and the mixture was distilled at 1200C with partial vacuum. The reaction was stopped when the amount of water contained in the distillate dropped below 0.1 . Sodium carbonate and citric acid buffer were added to neutralize the catalyst.
