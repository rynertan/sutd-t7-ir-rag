According to one feature of the present invention there are provided compounds of general formulaEMI1.1 wherein R1 represents a grouping of formula R3.NH.R4 where R represents a group CnH2n where n is an integer from 1 to 6 and R represents an acyl group of forttriila CYRa, CY.ZRb or CY.NH.Ra in which Y and Z, which may be the same or different, each represents oxygen or sulphur Ra represents a hydrogen atom or a an alkyl group which may contain from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, for example, a methyl, ethyl, propyl or isopropyl, butyl, sec butyl or tert butyl group, optional substituents being for example selected from one or more of halogen e.g. fluorine, chlorine or bromine cyano azido amino hydroxy C1 4 alkoxy, thiol, and C1 4 alkylthio, b an aralkyl group having up to 10 carbon atoms especially an arylmethyl group e.g. a benzyl or substituted benzyl group, suitable substituents bn the phenyl ring of a benzyl group being hydroxy, e.g.p hydroxy, or sulphonamido, e.g. m sulphonamido and suitable substituents on the methylene group of a benzyl group including azido, amino, carboxyl or hydroxy and protected forms thereof, or c an aryl group having up to 10 carbon atoms e.g.a phenyl or substituted phenyl group, suitable substituents being halogen e.g. chlorine cyano b alkoxy e.g. methoxy or alkyl e.g. methyl, and R represents a methyl or ethyl group 2a RZ represents a carboxyl esterifying group or a hydrogen atom and B represents a group, S or0 and salts thereof. Compounds according to the invention may be of use as antibiotics as detailed below or may be useful as intermediates in the preparation of active compounds or in the purification of active compounds. The compounds as shown in formula i have the 5R 6onfiguration but the invention extends not only to such individual isomers but also to mixtures of the compounds of formula I with the corresponding 5S isomers,for example in racemic mixtures. B preferably represents the group sus. In the group R , the group C H2n represented n 2n by R3 may have a straight or branched chain and n is preferably from 1 to 4 as, for example, in a methylene or ethylene group. Groups NHR which are of particular interest include formamido, acetamido, ureido, methylureido and phenylureido, and formamido is especially preferred. When When R represents a carboxyl esterifying group, it may for example be an organic group derived from an alcohol aliphatic or araliphatic , a phenol, a silanol or a stannanol. Such an alcohol, phenol, silanol or stannanol used to esterify the carboxyl group preferably contains not more than 24 carbon atoms. 2a Thus, the group R may represent a straight or branched unsubstituted or substituted alkyl or alkenyl group, preferably having from 1 8 carbon atoms, for example a methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec butyl, t butyl or allyl group, optional substituents being for example, alkoxy e.g. methoxy halogen i.e.fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine cyano acyloxy, e.g. alkanoyloxy, such as acetoxy or pivaloyloxy, or alkoxycarbonyloxy, such as ethoxycarbonyloxy acyl e.g. p bromobenzoyl and alkoxycarbonyl e.g. ethoxycarbonyl an aralkyl group having up to 20 carbon atoms especially an arylmethyl group e.g. a benzyl or substituted benzyl group, suitable substituents being halo e.g.chloro nitro, e.g. o or nitro cyano alkoxy e.g. p methoxy or alkyl e.g. methyl groups a diphenylmethyl or triphenylmethyl group or a fur 2 ylmethyl, thien 2ylmethyl or pyrid 4 ylmethyl group, the heterocyclic groups of which may also be substituted e.g. by a C14 alkyl group, preferably methyl an aryl group having up to 12 carbon atoms e.g. a phenyl or substituted phenyl group, suitable substituents being halo e.g. chloro nitro, e.g. o or p nitro cyano alkoxy e.g. p mrthoxy or alkyl e.g. methyl groups a cycloalkyl group containing not more than 12 carbon atoms e.g. adamantyl, cyclohexyl or cyclopentyl a heterocyclic group containing not more than 12 carbon atoms, the heteroatom being, for example, oxygen, as in the tetahydropyranyl or phthalidyl group a stannyl group having up to 24 carbon atoms for example a stannyl group carrying three substituents which may be the same or different selected from alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, or aralkoxy groups.Such groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, n butyl, phenyl and benzyl groups or a silyl group having up to 24 carbon atoms which may carry three groups which may be the same or different selected from alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl and aryl groups. Such groups will preferably be C14 alkyl e.g.methyl, ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl or t butyl groups. The alkyl, alkoxy, alkanoyloxy, alkanoyl and alkoxycarbonyl substituents referred to above preferably contain 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Where substituents are present on any of the above mentioned groups, there will preferably be only one of each of the substituents, with the exception of halogen, in which case there may be up to three substituents. Salts of compounds of formula I include, for example, salts of acidic compounds of the invention formed with inorganic and organic bases. Such salts include alkali metal salts, e.g. sodium, potassium and lithium salts, alkaline earth metal salts, e.g. calcium, and magnesium salts, ammonium salts, and substituted ammonium salts. Salts of compounds of formula I also include acid addition salts of compounds of formula I in which the R group contains a basic nitrogen atom.Examples of acid addition salts are those formed with hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, phosphoric lactic citric, fumaric, maleic, toluenesulphonic and trifluoroacetic acids. Compounds of formula I in which R2a is hydrogen and R carries a basic nitrogen atom may exist in zwitterionic forms and such zwitterionic forms are included within the present invention. In general acids and metabolically labile esters of compounds of formula 0 in which B represents oS, and salts of such compounds are the preferred forms for use in medicine. However, other compounds of the invention are also useful, particularly for the preparation and purification of the preferred compounds just referred to and other compounds. Thus for example, where the ester grouping is readily cleaved e.g. by hydrolysis or hydrogenolysis, without significant degradation of the rest of the molecule, the esters are especially useful as carboxyl protected derivatives of the parent compounds.Those esters which are readily cleaved and are primarily of use in this connection include arylmethyl esters, especially the benzyl, nitrobenzyl, benzhydryl and trityl esters as well as the stannyl, e.g. tri nbutylstannyl, and silyl esters. As indicated above, the ester grouping may be metabolically labile, i.e. it may be converted into the carboxylic acid during general metabolic processes e.g. in the blood or liver.Metabolically labile esters include substituted alkyl esters carrying an oxygen substituent on the a carbon atom, for example a acyloxyalkyl, e.g. acetoxymethyl and pivaloyloxymethyl esters a alkoxycarbonyloxyalkyl esters, e.g. l ethoxycarbonyloxyethyl esters and phthalidyl esters. Compounds of formula I wherein B represents ,S and R2a represents a hydrogen atom or a metabolically labile ester grouping, together with salts of such compounds, in general possess antibacterial activity. They have been found to be active against a range of grampositive and gram negative microorganisms, for example against strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus species, Escherichia coli Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella sonnei, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella aeroenes, P teus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens, Probidence species and Haemophilus influenzae. In general, the compounds are stable to the action of 8 lactamases produced by some gram positive organisms for example those produced by Staphylococcus aureus, and to p lactamases produced by some gram negative organisms such as Enterobacter cloacae. Compounds of formula I wherein B represents ,S and R2a represents a hydrogen atom or a metaboliclly labile ester grouping and physiologically acceptable salts of such compounds may thus be formulated as pharmaceutical including veterinary compositions which may if desired contain a further antibiotic.Such compositions will also contain carriers and or excipients and may, for example, be in a form adapted forcral or parenteral administration. Such compositions may thus, for example, take the form of powders, tablets, capsules, lozenges, solutions and syrups suitable for oral administration, and may include, for example, starch, lactose, talc, magnesium stearate, gelatin, distilled water and suspending, dispersing, emulsifying, flavouring or colouring agents. Active compounds of formula I may further be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas. For parenteral administration, the compounds may be presented in ampoules for formulation before use. The active compounds of formula I will generally be administered to humans at a total daily dosage level df 50 mg to 20 g, preferably from 100 mg to 10 g, which may be in divided doses given 1 4 times per day. Dosage units will in general contain 12.5 mg to 5 g, preferably 50 mg to 1 g of active compound according to tne invention. Active compounds of formula I may be of use in treating a variety of diseases, in humans and animals, caused by pathogenic bacteria, such as respiratory tract or urinary tract infections. The compounds of the invention may be prepared by two principal methods, namely by a ring closure and by acylation of corresponding penems carrying a free amino group. In general they may be obtained from available starting materials, as illustrated in the reaction scheme hereinafter The compounds of general formula I wherein B represents a group S may thus, for example, be prepared by reacting a compound of the formula II EMI8.1 wherein Rla is as defined above for R1 except that any amino, carboxyl, hydroxy or thiol groups should be in protected form or represents a group of formula R .f 3 where R is as defined above and R represents an azido or protected amino group R2 represents a carboxyl esterifying group as defined above for R2a R5 R5 represents a halogen atom or a group of formula NRXRYRZ in which Rx, RY and RZ, which may be the same or different, each represents an aliphatic, araliphatic or aromatic group or two of RX Thv and RZ together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached represent a five , six or seven membered heterocyclic ring optionally containing a further heteroatom and the third of RX, RY and RZ is as def inc c shove or R , RY and together with the nitrogen atcm to which they are attached form an aromatic heterocyclic ring or an aromatic or nonaromatic polycyclic heterocyclic system and R6 represents a leaving group, for example a halogen atom or an acylated or etherified hydroxy group with hydrogen sulphide where necessary in the presence of a base or sith a hydrosulphide or sulphide salt, followed where R is different from R1 in the desired compound of formula I , by conversion to a group of formula R3NH2 where R is as hereinbefore defined and subsequent acylation to give the desired compound of formula I , deesterification being optionally effected before, during or after said conversion of a group R into a group R NH2 or R1. Where a compound of formula II is employed which is racemic, the product of the invention obtained will likewise be racemic. If desired, a compound of formula I in which B represents S obtained by the above reaction may subsequently be oxidised, as discussed in more detail hereinafter, to yield a compound of formula I in which B represents a group SJO. Other optional subsequent reaction steps include reaction of a free acid of formula I with a base or reaction of a compound of formula I wherein the RÚ group contains a basic nitrogen atom with an acid to yield a salt and or R1 modification of the R group, including deprotection cf a compound in which R1 carries one or more protected carboxyl, amino, hydroxy or thiol groups to yield a compound in which R1 carries one or more free carboxyl, amino, hydroxy or thiol groups and or separation of a mixture of 5R and 55isomers to yield an individualSR isomer or formula I all of which optional steps are discussed in more detail hereinafter. Suitable hydrosulphide and sulphide salts include, for example, alkali metal, e.g. sodium, potassium and lithium salts alkaline earth metal, e.g. calcium, salts and onium salts, for example quaternary ammonium salts wherein the quaternary ammonium ion has the formulaEMI10.1 where R, R , R and R ,which may be the same or different,each represents an alkyl or aralkyl group. Examples of such salts include the benzyltrimethyl simmonium and tetra n butylammonium salts. In the reaction with hydrogen sulphide, the presence of a base, either organic or inorganic, is desirable to accelerate the reaction, to optimise yields and to curtail excessive acidity. It is in general preferred to use as weak a base as possible which is effective in the reaction. Suitable bases for use in the reaction include amine bases, for example, tertiary amine bases, e.g. trialkylamines, preferably. those wherein the alkyl groups have from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as triethylamine, hindered bases such as 3 azabicyclo t3,2,2 nonane or aromatic bases such as pyridine. Where R5 represents a halogen atom, the reaction will in general be effected at a temperature of from 150 C to 500C, reaction temperatures of from 590C to 100C, particularly 20OC to 40 C, being preferred. The reaction is desirably effected in the presence of an inert solvent, stable to the reaction conditions employed. Suitable solvents include, for example, cyclic ethers e.g. tetrahydrofuran and dioxan, halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. methylene chloride and 1,2 dichloroethane, esters, e.g. ethyl acetate and amide solvents, e.g. dimethylformamide. Alternatively, where the reaction is effected in the presence of a base, an excess of base may serve as solvent. Where R5 represents a group of formula t RXRYR,Z the reaction with hydrogen sulphide or a hydrosulphide or sulphide salt is preferably carried out at temperatures of from 300 to 300C. The reaction s completed by cyclisation to form a penem of formula I by heating. The cyclisation reaction is preferably effected above 4400 C, e.g. at 500 to 1000C. Following the reaction of the compound of formula 9 iT wherein R5 represents a group of formula N with the hydrogen sulphide or hydrosulphide or sulphide salt, it may be possible to isolate a thioenolate of the formula irk EMI11.1 wherein Rx, Ry, RZ, Rla and R2 have the above meanings . On heating, e.g. in a solvent such as ethyl acetate or l,2 dichloroethane, the compound of formula IIA cyclises to the desired penem ester of formula I . Cyclisation may if desired be carried out in the presence of an acid scavenging agent, e.g. an insoluble inorganic base such as solid, anhydrous sodium, potassium or calcium carbonate. In the compounds of formula II and IIA , when Rla represents a group of formula R3Rc wherein Rc represents a protected amino group, the latter will be cleavable to NH2 for example by hydrolysis or reduction, before or after cyclisation. Many acyl groups R4 will be similarly removable and may, indeed be removed, for example after cyclisation, to permit introduction of a more preferred acyl group R4. When R5 represents a halogen atom it is preferably a chlorine or bromine atom. In the case that R5 represents a group of formula e N R there will be an anion A associated with the compound of formula II . In general the anion A will be derived from the reagent used for the introduction of the group R6 e.g. a halide ion such as a chloride ion, as described hereinafter. Where R5 represents a group of formula RXRYRZX Rx, RY and Rz may, for example each represent an alkyl group having up to 8 carbon atoms. e.g. a C16 alkyl group preferably a C14 group, an aralkyl group having up to 6 carbon atoms in the alkyl portion or an aryl group, such aralkyl and aryl groups desirably being monocyclic, e.g.benzyl and phenyl, and such alkyl groups include also cycloaliphatic e.g. C37 ccioal yl groups or two of i RY and Rz may together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached represent a five, six or sevenmembered heterocyclic ring optionally containing a further oxygen or sulphur atom e.g. a N alkyl piperidinium orN alkyl morpholinium group or R RY and RZ may, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached represent a bicylic, non aromatic heterocyclic ring sstr e.g. a quinuclidinium group, or an aromatic ring e.g.pyridinium. A triethylammoni iitn group is particularly preferred. R6is preferably the residue of an acid R6H having a pKa in water at 250C of 3. 5 or less. Where R represents an acylated or eth erified hydroxy group this may, for example, be an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic or araliphatic carbonyloxy, sulphonyloxy or phosphinyloxy group containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms or an aliphatic ether group containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms. e.g. methoxy. Suitable suiphonyloxy groups include, for example, those wherein the aliphatic or aromatic grouping is an alkyl e.g. C1 8 group, which may be substituted by a halogen atom e.g. fluorine or chlorine, or an aryl e.g. C6 15 group which may carry alkyl, e.g. methyl, alkoxy e.g. methoxy or halogen e.g. bromine substituents. Suitable phosphinyloxy groups include, for example, groups of formulaEMI13.1 whereR7 and R , which may be the same or different, may each represent an alkyl, aryl or aralkyl group or may together with the phosphorus atom form a 5 or 6 membered ring. Alternatively R7 and or R8 may represent groups ORe and 0Rf respectively where Re and Rf are as defined for R7 and R8 or may together form a diva lent 5 or 6 membered ring. An example of the latter type of phosphinyloxy group is the group EMI14.1 Suitable carbonyloxy groups include, for example, those wherein the aliphatic or aromatic grouping is an alkyl e.g. C1 8 group optionally substituted by one or more halogen atoms or an aryl e.g. C6 15 group optionally substituted by, for example, one or more halogen atoms or nitro groups. When When R represents a halogen atom, this is preferably a chlorine or bromine atom. Preferred meanings for R include methanesulphonyloxy, trifluoromethanesulphonyloxy, p toluene suiphonyloxy, benzenesulphonyloxy, dimethoxyphosphinyloxy groups and a chlorine atom. The products of the ring closure reaction will be esters. Where a free acid of formula I or a salt of such an acid is ultimately required, the ester may subsequently be cleaved at any stage after the ring closure. Where an ester of a compound of formula I is required different from that originally produced, tnis may be obtained by deesterification followed by reesterification as described hereinbelow Suitable methods for deesterification are well known in the art. Thus, for example, a silyl or stannyl ester may be cleaved by mild solvolysis e g. by reaction with water, alcohols, phenols or carboxylic acids e.g. acetic acid.Alternatively, esters which are readily subject to reduction, for example, arylmethyl esters such as benzl, benzhydryl, trityl or more preferably, p nitrobenzX71 esters may be cleaved by reduction e.g. by hydrogenol,s s for example using a metal catalyst, e. g. a noble metal slwer as platinum, palladium or rhodium. The catalyst may be supported e.g. on charcoal or kleselguhr. In the case of p nitrobenzyl esters, cleavage may also be effected by reduction of the nitro group e.g. using a dissolving metal reducIng agent such as zinc in acetic acid or zinc in aqueous tetrahydrofuran or acetone controlled in the pH range 3 6. DreferaL 4 5.5 e.g. by the addition of aqueous HC1 aluminium amalgam in a moist ether, e.g. tetrahydrofuran or iron and ammonium chloride in an aqueous ether such as aqueous tetrahydrofuran followed by hydrolysis either under the reduction conditions or by subsequent treatment with acid. Alternatively, a p nitrobenzyl ester may be cleaved under alkaline conditions using, for example, sodium sulphide in a solvent such as aqueous tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide or acetone. As indicated hereinafter, reactive cleavage of an ester may result in simultaneous reduction of an azido group or reductive cleavage of a protected amino group in R1. Similarly hydrolysis may simultaneously cleave a protected amino group in R1 or the group NHR itself and care must therefore be taken to cleave the ester selectively where such simultaneous cleavage is not desired. Where it is desired to produce a salt of the compound of formula I , an acid dry be reacted, e. g. in an appropriate organic solvent with an appropriate base, preferably in equimolar quantities and preferably under conditions favouring precipitation of the salt. In the formation of alkali metal salts for example, e.g. sodium or potassium salts, an alkanoate is a preferred base e. g. a 2 ethyl hexanoate. Where the compound of formula I obtained is a compound in which the R1 group contains a basic nitrogen atom, it may, if desired, subsequently be converted into an acid addition salt by reaction with an appropriate acid. Sulphoxides of formula I according to the invention may be prepared from the corresponding sulphides of formula I by, for example, oxidation with peracids such as peracetic, monoprphthalic, m chloroperbenzoic or metaperiodic acid. Oxidation is preferably effected at a temperature not greater than 100C and avoiding excess oxidising agent. Esters of the acid of formula I may, for example, be prepared by reaction with an alcohol, phenol, silanol or stannanol or a reactive derivative thereof to form the desired ester. Reactionswill desirably be effected under mild conditions in order to prevent rupture of the bicyclic nucleus. The use of neutral or mild acidic or basic conditions therefore, at temperatures between 70 and 350C is preferred. The alkyl, alkoxyalkyl and aralkyl esters may be prepared by reaction of the acid of formula I with the appropriate diazoalkane or diazoaralkane e.g. diazomethane or diphenyldiazomethane. The reaction will generally be effected in an ether, ester or a halohydrocarbon solvent, e. g. diethyl ether, ethyl acetate or dichloromethane. In general, reduced temperatures are preferred for example 15 to 15 C. The esters derived from alcohols may slse be produced by reaction of a reactive derivative of the alcohol, for example a halide such as the chloride.bromide or iodide or a hydrocarbonsulphonyl derivative such as a methanesuiphonyl or p toluenesulphow,ri ester with a salt of the acid of formula I e.g. an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt such as a lithium sodium potassium, calcium or barium salt or an amine salt such as a triethylammonium salt. This reaction is preferably carried out in a substituted sulphoxide or amide solvent, e.g. dimethyl sulphoxide, dimethylformamide or hexa methylphosphoramide . Alternativel y4 the esters may be prepared by reaction of the acid with the alcohol in the presence of a condensing agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Stannyl esters may conveniently be formed by reaction of the carboxylic acid of formula T or a salt thereof with reactive tetravalent tin moieties. Trialkyl tin oxides are preferred for the synthesis of tin compounds in view of their availability and low toxicity. Silyl esters of the acid of formula I may be formed by reaction with a reactive tetravalent silicon moiety.Trialkylsilyl halides and mono or bis silylated acetamides are preferred as silylating agents.. Proton acceptors e.g.weak bases such as pyridine may often be used with advantage when hydrogen halides are formed during such esterification. Where the initial product of the ring closure is a compound corresponding to formula T but shere. z1 repre 3c sents a group of formula R R , such a compound may be further reacted in order to convert the group of formula R3Ra into a group of formula R3NH2 which group may then be acylated to produce the desired compound of formula I . Separation of a mixture of a SR isomer of formula I with the corresponding SS isomer may be effected,for example, by knows techniques such as fractional crstallisation of a salt of an acid of the invention formed with an optically active base.Methods of separation and resolution are described, for example, in Tables ofResolving Agents and Optical Resolutions by S. H.Wilen, published by University of Notre Dame Press 1972. Acylation of a compound of formula IA EMI18.1 wherein RIb is a grouping of formula R3NH2, where R3 has the above meaning, and R2a and B have the above meanings, constitutes a further feature of the invention.The SR isomer of formula IA may be reacted alone or in admixture with the corresponding 5S isomer. Where a mixture of isomers is acylated but only tfle SR isomer of formula I is required, separation may be effected, for example as described above. Where R2a is a hydrogen atom, the compound of formula aA exists as a zwitterion. Acylation may be effected by reaction with an acylating agent e.g. of formula X C Y.Ra, X.CY.Z Rb or X CYNHRa where Y, Z, Ra and Rb are as hereinbefore defined and X represents a displaceable rtiDstituenrt for example, a halogen atom, c .g chlorine or bromine, an O acyl group, an 0 hydrocarbyl group or a hydroxy group.Thus for example, the acylating agent mav be a carboxylic or thiocarboxylic acyl halide, carbamoyl halide, thiocarbamoyl halide, or haloformyl ester X halogen a carboxylic acyl anhydride, which may be symmetrical or mixed X O.Acyl a carboxylic or thiocarboxylic acid in the presence of a coupling agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiirnide X OH or an active ester of a carboxylic or thiocarboxylic acid, such as 4 nitrophenylformate. The acylating agen may, however, also be a keter or sulphene or an isocyanate or isothiocyanate or an activated imide. In order to avoid complicating side reactions where it is desired to prepare a compound of formula I in which Rêa represents a hydrogen atom, the acylation reaction is often more conveniently carried out before removal of the carboxyl esterifying group. The use of compounds of formula IA having an ester group COOR is particularly preferred in reactions involving the use of a carboxylic or thiocarboxylic acid in the presence of a coupling agent such as dicyclohexylcarbod iimide an arylmethyl ester group, e.g. a benzyl ester group, is preferred. Acylation with an acyl anhydride or an isocyanate may, however, readily be effected on the free acid in which R2a ishydrogen. In mapy cases, acylation may be assisted by the presence of a bis trialkyl tin oxide, such as bis tri n butyl tin oxide. Activated imides will generally be N acyl cyclic imides. Such compounds may have the formula RdReN.CY., d e wherein Rv and R together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form a heterocyclic ring, in which the nitrogen is linked to two carbonyl groups, f aY represents oxygen or sulphur and R represents R or ZRb where Ra, Rb and Z are as defined above. In some cases it may be preferable to form an activated derivative of the parent amine prior to acylation, e.g. a C15 trialkylsilyl derivative such as a trimethylsilyl derivative. Carboxylic acyl, thiocarboxylic acyl, or carbamoyl halide reagents are preferably the chlorides.Mixed anhydride reagents preferably contain the acyl group to be introduced attached to a tertiary alkanoyloxy or C15 alkoxycarbonyloxy grouping, e.g.pivaloyloxy or ethoxycarbonyloxy. Reactive ester reagents include aryl esters, especially aryl esters carrying electron withdrawing substituents e.g. nitrophenyl esters.Reactive ester reagents prepared from N hydroxyimides e.g.N hydroxysuccinimide and from other reagents e.g. 1hydroxybenzotriazole or 2 mercaptopyridine, may also be used. The reactive ester reagent may conveniently be formed in situ. It may be convenient to carry out the reaction in the presence of a base, preferably a weak base, e.g. an inorganic base such as an alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate or an organic base e.g. a tertiary base such as a trialkylamine, particularly when the aminoacid zwitterion form of the parent amine or an acid addition salt thereof is used as starting material or, where the acylating agent liberates acid, the base thereby functioning as an acid binding agent. Suitable solvents for the reaction include aprotic solvents such as an amide, e.g. dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide or hexamethylphosphoramide an ester, e.g.ethyl acetate an ether, e.g. tetrahydrofuran or dioxan a ketone, e.g. acetone a halogenated hydrocarbon, e.g.dichloromethane or chloroform a substituted sulphoxide, e.g. dimethylsulphoxide or mixtures of the above solvents.Reactions with acyl halides and anhydrides may also be effected in aqueous solutions, e.g. aqueous acetone or tetrahydrofuran. The reaction is advantageously effected at or below room temperature e.g. in the range 200 to 35 C. When, in a compound corresponding to formula I but in which R1 represents a group R3Rc, the group Rc represents an azido group, conversion of the azido group into an amino group is effected by means of reduction, for example by catalytic hydrogenation. The hydrogenation catalyst is normally a noble metal catalyst, e.g. palladium, platinum or rhodium, or another transition metal catalyst such as nickeL. The catalyst may be supported e.g. on charcoal or kieselguhr the metal catalyst is preferably palladium e.g. as 10 palladium on charcoal.Hydrogenation will desirably be effected in a solvent for the starting material. Suitable solvents for the hydrogenation include ethers such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran esters such as ethyl acetate ketones such as acetone or methyl etht ketone chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride amides such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide or alcohols such as ethanol or mixtures thereof. Such solvents may advantageously be mixed with water or an aqueous buffer. In some combinations a two phase system may result. in cases where the substrate is sufficiently water soluble, water or an aqueous buffer may be used alone. The azido group may alternatively be reduced using dissolving metal reducing agentse.g. zinc and aqueous hydrochloric acid controlled in the pH range 2 to 6, preferably 4 4. 5. Suitable solvents include, for example, water miscible solvents such as ketones e.g. acetone, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and alcohols such as ethanol. Certain esters used as starting materials may be cleaved during reduction, e.g. arylmethyl esters such as E nitrobenzyl esters, to yield a free carboxyl group.Selective reduction of the azide group is possible where the ester group is not cleavable by reduction or only cleavable under different conditions from those used to reduce the azide group. The acid product of formula IA may be isolated from solution by, for example, partitioning between the solvent where water immiscible and water and after removal of catalyst, the aqueous phase may be lyophilised to yield the desired acid. The acid product of formula IA may also be isolated from solution by precipitation or crystallisation either as its zwitterionic form or as a salt as defined above. Depending on conditions the isolated compound may. be in the form of a solvate or hydrate. Where, in a compound corresponding to formula I but in which R1 represents a group R3Rd, the group Rd represents a protected amino group, deprotection may be effected by conventional methods. Thus, for example a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed by catalytic hydrogenation, while the t butoxycarbonyi group may be removed by acid hydrolysis. Such deprotection may, if desired, be accompanied by simultaneous cleavage of the ester group CQOR2a or selective deprotection may be effected. Where a compound of formula I is formed in which R carries a carboxyl, amino, hydroxy or thiol group in protected form and such a group is required in the free form, deprotection may subsequently be effected, for example using conventional techniques such as hydrolysis or hydrogenolysis. Thus, for example, deesterification and deprotection of an amino group may be effected by the methods described above in relation to R a and Rd respectively. The compounds of general formula II used as starting materials may be prepared by a variety of methods. Thus they may, for example, be prepared by reaction sequences involving clavulanic acid and its derivatives or they may beprepared by total synthesis. One method of preparing compounds o.f general formula II wherein R5 represents a halogen atom involves reacting a compound of formula III EMI24.1 wherein Ria, R 2 and R6 are asbereinbefore defined and is a group of formula SR10 orEMI24.2 where R represents an aliphatic, araliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic group with an electrophilic halogenating agent. The halogenating agent msy, for example, be molecular halogen or an N halo amide or imide. The N halo amide or N halo imide may include a cyclic system, the amide or imide linkage forming part of the cyclic system examples of such N halo amides include N bromo caprolactam and examples of such N halo imides include the l,3 dibromo 5,5 di lower alkyl hydantoins e.g.1,3 dibromo S,5 dime tlhyl hydantoin N bromosuccinimide N chlorosuccinimide N bromophthalimide etc. Other useful N halo amidesinclude N halo lower alkanoamidese.g. N bromoacetamide. The reaction will preferably be carried out in an inert solvent, e.g. a halogenated hydrocarbon, for example, methylene chloride. Molecular halogen, e.g. chlorine or bromine, may, for convenience, be added in solution, e.g. in a halogenated hydrocarbon, such as carbon tetrachl6ride. Suitable reaction temperatures are from 1500C to 25 C. The use of low temperature e.g. below about OOC, has been found advantageous in assisting the control of the reaction. Where molecular halogen is used, it may be desirable to carry out the reaction in the presence of an acid binding agent in order to remove any hydrogen halide as it is formed and thus prevent side reactions. Suitable acid binding agents include amides e.g. carboxvlic aoid amides such as acetamide, metal carbonates e.g. calcium carbonate, oxiranes e.g propylene oxide, and molecular sieves. The acid binding agent, when used, will desirably be present in a quantity which ensures as rapid removal of hydrogen halide as possible. When R10 represents an aliphatic group, this may be saturated or unsaturated and thus may, for example, be an alkyl or alkenyl group which may contain 1 6 carbon atoms e.g. C14 alkyl such as methyl or butyl, or a cycloalkyl group, which may have 3 7, preferably 5 or 6 carbon atoms. Such alkyl groups may, optionally, carry one or more etherified hydroxy groups. When R10 represents an araliphatic or aromatic group, it will desirably be an aralkyl group which may have 1 6 carbon atoms in the alkyl portion, or an sryl group, the rings in such aryl and aralkyl groups, preferably being monocyclic, e.g. phenyl and optionally carrying substituents such as C14 alkyl groups e.g. methyl groups. When R10 represents a heterocyclic group, it will desirably contain a carbon attached 5 7 membered heterocyclic ring containing one or more heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulphur or oxygen, which may be aromatic e.g.pyridyl and or carry one or more alkyl groups, for example containing 1 6 carbon atoms e.g. a methyl group or may have a bicyclic structure, an example of such a group being a benzothiazol 2 yl group. Specific groups R9 which may be mentioned include, for example, methylsulphinyl p tolylthio C1 4 alkylthio e.g. n butylthio, methylthio and ethylthio and benzylthio groups. Compounds of formula III may, for example, be prepared from compounds of formula IV . EMI26.1 wherein R1a, R2 and R9 are as hereinbefore defined by reaction with one or more reagents serving to replace the enolic hydroxy group by, or convert the enolic hydroxy group into, a leaving group e. g. a halogen atom or an acyloxy or ether group. Compounds of formula III in which R6 represents a halogen atom may, for example, be prepared by treating a compound of formula IV with dimethylformamide and phosphorus trichloride at a temperature of from 20 to 40 C. 6 Compounds of formula III in which R is an acyloxy group may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula IV with an appropriate acylating agent, e.g.an acyl halide or anhydride. Such an acyl halide will desirably be a phosphinyl or sulphonyl halide, the phosphinyl and sulphonyl portions being as defined above.Thus, in this case, the compound of formula IV may be reacted with an alkane sulphonyl halide or aryl sulphonyl halide, for example methanesulphonyl halide, p toluene sulphonyl halide or a dialkoxyphosphinyl chloride e.g.dimethoxyphosphinyl chloride. Reaction is normally carrot out in a solvent, e.g. an ether such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran or a halogenated hydrocarbon such as methylene chloride. Reaction temperatures are generally from 30 to 300C, preferably from 150 to 20 C. The reaction will normally be effected in the presence of an acid binding agent, e.g. a tertiary amine such as triethylamine, pyridine or collidine or an oxirane such as propylene oxide. Compounds of formula III in which R6 is an e.i group may, for example, be prepared from compounds of formula IV by reaction with a diazoalkane, e.g.diazomethane, optionally in the presence of a Lexis all catalyst such as boron trifluoride etherate. The react may be effected in a solvent such as an ether e.g.diethylether, dioxan or tetrahydrofuran, a hydrocarbon e light petroleum fraction, or a halogenated hydrocarbo1. dichloromethane or chloroform. The reaction temperature is preferably low, e.g. 15 to 150C. Alternatively a compound of formula II where S is a leaving group, and R represents a halogen atom ma be prepared from a compound corresponding to formula II but where R is hydroxy., by reaction with one or more reagents serving to replace the hydroxy group by or convert it into a leaving group, e.g. a halogen atom or e acyloxy or ether group. Such reagents may be 6f the type previously described in relation to compounds of formula IV . For acylation an acid binding agent will normally be present, e.g. an oxirane such a propylene oxide or a base where a base is used this is preferably a weak base such as pyridine. The compounds corresponding to formula II in which R5 is halogen but in which R6 is hydroxy may be prepared from compounds of formula IV by reaction with an electrophilic halogenating agent e.g. of the type described above in relation to the compounds of formula III . The compounds of formula IV wherein R9 represents a group of formula SR10 as defined above and R1a represents a grouping of formula CH2 CH2NHR4 or CH2CM2 F where 4 cR and R are as hereinbefore defined , may be readily prepared from the compounds of formula V EMI28.1 wherein Rê is as defined above and RÚÚ represents a grouping of formula NHR4 or Rc where R4 and Rc are as defined above by reaction thereof with a thiol R10SH, wherein R10 is as defined above. The thiol R SH will preferably be present in excess as compared with the starting material of formula V . The reaction will desirably be carried out in an aprotic organic solvent, e.g. an ether solvent such as tetrahydrofuran although the thiol may itself serve as the medium for the reaction. The reaction will desirably be carried out at or above ambient temperature, e.g. at from 200 to 800 C. The compounds of formula V may be prepared from compounds of formula vr EMI29.1 wherein R2 and R have the above meanings analovousl to the method described in Belgian Patent No. 858515 by treatment thereof at elevated temperature with a base.Preferred bases for use in this reaction are tertiary organic bases e.g. tertiary amines. Such amines will desirably have the formula R RYR N, where RX, RY andRz are as defined above. Use of simpler trialkylamines e.g. having 1 6 carbon atoms in each alkyl group, particularly methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl groups, is preferred and trietkx b amine is especially preferred. Reaction will desirably be carried out in a suitable inert solvent. Such solvents will preferably have some degree of polarity and include esters e.g. ethyl acetate.ethers e.g. tetrahydrofuran, ketones e.g. acetone, amides e.g. dimethylformamide and halogenated hydrocarbons e.g.1,2 dichloroethane or chloroform. Reaction will desirably be effected under reflux, a temperature of from 500C to 1000C being preferred. S Compounds of formula II wherein R represents a group of formula RxRyRz may be prepared by reaction of compounds of formula VII EMI29.2 VII where Rla, R2, Rx, RY and RZ have the above meanings by reaction with an appropriate reagent serving to introduce the group R6. The introduction of the group R6 may be effected by the procedures described above for the formation of compounds of for iclla III .In particular, the compound of formula VII may be reacted with a sulphonylating agent e. g. a methanesulphonylating agent such as methane sulphonyl chloride to form a product of formula it in which R is methanesulphonyloxy. in general, as mentioned above. an anion A6, derived from the reagent used for introduction of the group R6, e.g. a halide ion such as a chloride ion will be associated with the compound of formula II thus formed. The reaction may be effected in the presence of a base for example a tertiary base such as pyridine. The latter may serve as solvent or a further solvent may be present, e.g. a halogenated hydrocarbon such as methylene chloride or 1,2 dichloroethane. If desired such a compound of formula VII may be used in the presence of pyridine to prepare a compound of formula II in situ which compound may then be directly cyclised to a compound of formula I by addition of triethylamine and passing in hydrogen sulphide. Heating, e.g.to about 700C completes the reaction. where a compound of formula IIA is prepared from a compound of formula VII without isolation of the compound of formula II , the compound of formula IIA may be partly in the form of an acid addition salt with an acid HA where A is as defined above such as HC1. Compounds of formula VII may, for example, be prepared by reaction of a compound corresponding to formula II in which 5 is halogen but in which R6 is a hydroxy group with an excess of a tertiary base NRxRyRZ in the presence of a solvent such as ethyl acetate at temperatures of from 0 to 300C, preferably art ambient temperature. Compounds of formula VII in which R represents 11 11 a grouping of formula CH 2CH2 R where Rll is as hereinbefore defined may alternatively be prepared by a ring opening reaction on a compound of formula VI employing a base NRXRYRZ. Where NRXRYRZ is to be the residue of a weak base such as pyridine it may be possible to perform the ring opening by reaction with the weak base in the presence of a catalytic quantity of a strong base. The ring opening reaction is preferably effected in the presence of a solvent such as ethyl acetate at temperatures of from 0 to 300C, most preferably at ambient temperature.Compounds of formula VII in which R1 represents a grouping of R11 formula CH2CH2R may also be prepared by treatment of a compound of formula V with a base NRXRYRZ. Compounds of formula VI may be prepared as described in German OLS 27 47 599 or by methods analogous thereto. It should be noted that in the above reaction sequences and those described hereinafter the groups R1a and COOR2a may be modified using the above described techniques between the various reaction stages set out, although remaining within the stated definition. Thus, for example conversion of an azido group or protected amino group into a group of formula NHR as required in the final compound of formula I , and or deesterification of a group such as R2a followed by reesterification, may be carried out either on a compound of formula VI , after the cyclisation of a compound of formula II or at some intermediate stage. Protecting la groups on R may also be replaced by others which may be more appropriate at an intermediate stage. The compounds of formula IV in which Rla represents a group R3Rc in which Rc is an azido group may be prepared as described in our European PatentApplication No. 3415. Certain of the compounds of formula it , IIa , III and IV and compounds corresponding to formula II in which R5 is halogen but wherein R6 is hydroxy are believed to be novel compounds and thus according to a further feature of the invention there are provided compounds of the general formula VIII EMI32.1 wherein Rlc is as defined for R other than a group of formula R3N3 where R3 is as defined above R2 represents a carboxyl esterifying group and M either represents a halogen atom or a group R9 in which R 10 0 10 10 represents a group SR or S R where R is an aliphatic, araliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic group and R a represents a hydroxy group or a leaving group or M represents a group of formula zi NRXRYR v wherein Rx, Ry, Rz and A are hereinbefore defined and R6a represents a leaving group or M represents a group NRxRyRz where RX, RY and R are as hereinbefore defined 6a and R represents S or 0 .Compounds of general formula V except where R is a group R R where Rc is N3 are also new and constitute a further feature of the invention. Processes for the preparation of the compounds embraced by formula VIII such processes being as set out hereinbefore constitute yet further features of the present invention The invention also includes non toxic physiological precursors of the active compounds of the invention, that is substances which on administration are converted in vivo into the antibiotic compounds. In the case of the acids of formula I R2a H , their metabolically labile esters which already fall within the definition of the compounds of the invention are examples of such physiological precursors.
