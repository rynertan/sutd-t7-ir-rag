The apparatus consists of a pair of insertable adapters 20, 42, 70 for the ends of a cylin drical core 14, 34, 74 which holds a supply of plastics stretch films 12, 32, 74 and a pair of tubular like grip means 16, 36, 72 for said insertable adapters. The grip means serves as a control means for the speed of paying out the plastics stretch film material, and as a means for applying tension on the film during the course of applying it to materials and items. The apparatus may be used for manual or machine application of film to materials. Brake shoe equivalents of the grip means may be used for machine applications.
