# Coil spring for transluminal implantation and planar blank for the manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
Planar blank 1 3 intended for the manufacture of a coil spring 5 7 suitable for transluminal implantation, characterized by an elongated, essentially straight mid section 9 11 which at its ends passes over into end sections that are bent in the plane of the blank in opposite directions to form a blank having Z shape, whereby a coil spring made from the blank in which the spring material as seen in cross section has radially flattened shape at its ends has a lower pitch than the mid section or no pitch at all and a coil spring made from such blank.
