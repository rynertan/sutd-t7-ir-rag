## Description
The invention relates to an electrical connector and to a method of assembling the discrete wires of a bundle of wires to an electrical connector housing. A known type of connector housing is formed with a wire receiving duct extending rearwardly from a portion adjacent a contact face and opening at a wire receiving mouth at a rear face, a row of closely spaced contacts being received in respective cavities at the contact face which cavities extend transversely of and communicate with the duct portion. Flat cable, in which a series of wire like conductors are located in side by side relation at the same pitch as the passageways by webs of insulation, may readily be assembled in the housing for termination, by insertion of a free end into and along the duct so that the conductors are aligned with respective contacts. The contacts are then driven into engagement with respective conductors and a rear portion of the housing adjacent the mouth crimped into engagement with the cable to provide strain relief. An example of such connector is described in EP A 108477. There is disclosed in FR A 2 236 290, from which the preambles of present Claims 1,4 and 6 have been derived, an electrical connector having a wire receiving cavity that opens to the exterior of the housing. A row of closely spaced contacts are received in cavities which extend transversely of and communicate with the wire receiving cavity. Wires are inserted into the cavity and there along where they are terminated by respective contacts. There is disclosed in DE A 2 523 915 a wire holder for the assembly of discrete wires to an electrical connector. The wire holder provides a row of wire locating apertures at the same pitch as the contacts of the connector. By inserting the wires into the apertures, a subassembly is formed which brings, prior to connection of the wires to the connector, the discrete wires into alignment with the respective connector contacts. A problem arises, particularly in the field when it is desired to assemble and terminate, in a connector housing, discrete wires extending from a bundle of wires. The discrete wires cannot readily be maintained in the desired serial positions and at the correct pitch during insertion into the connector when unraveled from the bundle. From one aspect, the present invention consists in a method of assembling and terminating discrete wires, extending from a bundle of wires, in an electrical connector of the type comprising an insulating housing having a wire receiving duct extending rearwardly from a duct portion adjacent a contact face and opening at a wire receiving mouth at a rear face, and a row of closely spaced contacts received in contact receiving cavities at the contact face, which cavities extend transversely of and communicate with the duct portion, in which method the wires are inserted through the mouth into and along the duct into alignment with the contacts and the contacts are urged into the duct into terminating engagement with the wires, characterized by the steps of respectively loading the discrete wires into wire locating apertures of a wire holder to form a subassembly prior to insertion of the wires into the duct, said apertures being spaced at the same pitch as the contacts, and said wires being slidable in the apertures, and inserting the subassembly into and along the duct thereby to position the discrete wires in alignment with respective contacts. Preferably, when used with a connector in which the duct portion communicates with an enlarged mouth through a common, divergent wire guiding throat, the subassembly is inserted axially along the duct until the wire holder is arrested by interference with the throat and the wires are then slid or advanced through the holder into the duct portion at the same pitch as the contacts. The wire holder retains the discrete wires at the same pitch as the contacts enabling rapid and accurate termination simply by pushing the cable manually. From another aspect, the invention consists in an electrical connector comprising an insulating housing having a wire receiving duct extending rearwardly from a duct portion adjacent a contact face and opening at a wire receiving mouth at a rear face, a row of closely spaced contacts received in cavities at the contact face, which cavities extend transversely of and communicate with the duct portion, and a series of discrete wires extending from a bundle and inserted into the duct through the mouth along the duct to the duct portion where they are respectively terminated by contacts urged into the duct portion and into engagement with the wires, characterized by a wire holder, which is a slidable fit in the duct, located in the duct and having wire locating apertures disposed at the same pitch as the contacts, the discrete wires being respectively located in the wire locating apertures, and being a slidable fit therein. The housing may include a clamping portion deformed into gripping engagement with the wires at a location between the rear face and the wire holder to provide strain relief and retain the wire holder in the housing duct. Desirably, the apertures open toward the contacts and are in staggered relation with adjacent apertures being located in different rows. This both enables the discrete wires to be maintained at the same close pitch as the contacts and the apertures to be defined by adjacent wall portions in a comb like structure in spite of the close pitch. Conveniently, the wires are loaded into the wire holder at locations spaced from their free ends, the free ends trimmed to lengths corresponding to axial lengths of the passageways and throat, and the wire holder then slid along the wires to the free ends. This ensures that the wires are trimmed to the correct length so that they extend sufficiently along the cavities for effective termination in the final axial position of the wire holder relative to the cable. The apertures may open to only one or both sides of the wire holder providing comb like structures which facilitate entry of the wires in the holder. The slots can have resilient wire entry portions of reduced width securely to retain the wires in the apertures throughout the loading step. From a further aspect, the invention consists in an electrical connector kit comprising an insulating housing having a wire receiving duct extending rearwardly from a duct portion adjacent a contact face and opening at a wire receiving mouth at a rear face, a row of closely spaced contact receiving cavities at the contact face communicating with the duct portions, and contacts respectively disposed in the cavities, characterized by a wire holder having wire locating apertures at the same pitch as the contacts, said wire holder being slidable into the duct mouth when loaded with a series of discrete wires extending from a bundle of wires to bring the discrete wires into alignment with the contacts, and said wire locating apertures being adapted to permit the wires to slide relatively thereto. Preferably, the duct portion located adjacent the contact face communicates with an enlarged mouth through a divergent throat of smaller size than the wire holder, and movement of the latter along the duct is arrested by abutment with the throat. An example of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which FIGURE 1 is an isometric view of a known electrical connector in which wires can be terminated according to the method of the invention FIGURE 2 is a cross sectional view of the connector of Figure 1 FIGURE 3 is a cross sectional view along line 3 3 of Figure 2 FIGURE 4 is a rear view of the connector FIGURE 5 is an isometric view of a wire holder according to the invention FIGURES 6a and 6b are isometric views of first and second steps of loading discrete wires into the wire holder and FIGURES 7a through 7d are isometric views showing successive steps of loading a subassembly of the wire holder and wires into the connector and termination of the wires. As shown particularly in Figures 1 to 4, a connector suitable for use in the invention is similar to that used for ribbon cable and disclosed in EP A 108477, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Briefly described, the connector comprises a housing 11 moulded in one piece of suitable plastics material formed with a wire receiving duct extending rearwardly from a duct portion, which comprises a single row of blind ended wire receiving passageways 12, adjacent a contact face to a common, divergent, wire guiding throat 13 with a wire receiving mouth 14 of increased size. Lateral walls 15 between adjacent passageways 12 are perforate passageways for receipt of the insulating web extending between conductors when used with the ribbon cable and conductor supporting rails 16 extend along the floor of each passageway. Contact receiving cavities 17 at the contact face communicate with the passageways and insulation piercing contacts 18 are preloaded in the cavities for termination with the respective conductors in the passageways. Deformable cable clamping latches 19 are formed in a wall of the mouth for deformation into the mouth into clamping engagement with a cable terminated in the connector. A wire holder 21 is moulded in one piece of plastics material with a series of staggered wire locating apertures 22 located at the same pitch the passageways 12 but in two rows 23 and 24, having centrelines on opposite sides of the centreline of the passageways, adjacent apertures being in different rows. The apertures open to a common side of the wire holder providing a resilient comb like structure, walls of the apertures constituting teeth. Wire entry portions 25 of each aperture are of reduced width securely to retain wires in the holder. The overall size of the wire holder is such that it is receivable as a sliding fit in the mouth 14. In order to assemble ends of discrete wires of a bundle of wires in a shielded cable, the outer insulating jacket is stripped adjacent the end to expose the foil shield which is returned over the jacket. The discrete wires are then unraveled and drawn laterally into the holder in their desired serial position with the holder spaced from the leading edges as shown in Figure 6A. The ends of the discrete wires are then trimmed so that their leading edges are of lengths corresponding to the axial lengths of the passageway plus the axial length of the throat. The wire holder is then slid along the wires to a location adjacent their leading ends thereby holding the leading ends in a fixed position Figure 6B . The subassembly is then inserted into the mouth Figure 7A and advanced by pushing the cable until the wire holder abuts the throat Figure 7B when the discrete wires will be advanced through the wire holder guided by the throat into respective passageways as shown in Figure 7C. The contacts 18 are then driven against the wires in known manner and the clamping portion deformed into engagement with the wires behind the wire holder to assist in providing strain relief Figure 7D . It will be appreciated that the location of the centrelines of the rows of apertures 23, 24 equidistant from the centreline of the passageway permits the leading ends of the wires to be guided by the throat into the passageways with minimum deviation. The resiliency of the aperture walls or teeth of the comb like wire holder adjacent the wire entry ends of the wire holder apertures enables the wires to be loaded therein one by one and securely retained therein while remaining wires are manipulated into a desired position
