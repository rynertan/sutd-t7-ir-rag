# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO CREAMING APPARATUS

## Abstract
Biscuit creaming apparatus 1 comprises a stencil tube 2 rotatably mounted on a rotatable stencil sleeve 3 , the stencil sleeve having spaced apart outlet ports 5 alignable with discharge orifices 6 in the stencil tube. Alignment can take place with both the tube 2 and sleeve 3 stationary whereby cream supplied to the stencil sleeve is caused to discharge from the discharge orifices of the stencil tube at an angle to the vertical, for purging purposes as in Figures 7 and 8 . Alternatively, alignment with the stencil sleeve 3 stationary and the stencil tube 2 rotatable thereabout, causes cream supplied to the stencil sleeve to discharge downwardly and sequentially from orifices 6 in the stencil tube on to biscuit shells carried by conveyor band 44. The preferred angle of discharge is between about 45 and 135 to the vertical. When purging, the cream is discharged from the orifices 6 such that a tray 47 can easily be placed in position to collect the cream.
