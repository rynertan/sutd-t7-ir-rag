It is further preferred that R1 be selected fromC1 4alkoxy, C1 4alkyl and halogen and Rê and R are both hydrogen. Similarly R is preferably chosen from carboxyl, tetrazol 5 yl or carboxyvinyl, and R5 and R6 are both hydrogen, and an especially preferred group of compounds are those having the following formulaEMI5.1 in which R1 is C1 4 alkoxy, C1 4alkyl or halogen and R4 is carboxyl, tetrazol 5 yl or carboxyvinyl, or a salt or ester thereof. A further preferred group of compounds is one of formula II above, in which R1 is carboxyl especially in the 5 position , R2 especially in the 7 position is hydrogen, C 4alkenyl or C 1 4alkyl, and R4, R5 and R6 are each hydrogen, hydroxyl, C3 4alkenyl, C1 4alkyl, C3 4alkenyloxy, C1 4alkoxy or the groupEMI5.2 when R7 and R8 are each hydrogen or C 1 4 alkyl and of those compounds the most preferred are those in which R1 is carboxyl especially those substituted in the 5 position , R2 is hydrogen and R4, R5 and R6 are each hydrogen, carboxyl, C1 4alkyl or C1 4alkoxy. Suitable salts of compounds of invention include for example, those of mineral bases such as alkali metal hydroxides, especially the potassium or sodium salts, or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, especially the calcium salts, or of organic bases such as amines for example trimethylamine. When the compounds contain an amino group or a basic nitrogen atom, acid addition salts are included such as those with inorganic acids, for example hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, sulphuric or phosphoric acids, or with organic acids, such as organic carboxylic acids, for example, glycollic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, salicylic, o acetoxybenzoic, nicotinic or isonicotinic acid, or organic sulphonic acids for example methane sulphonic, ethane sulphonic, 2 hydroxyethane sulphonic, toluene p sulphonic or naphthalene 2 sulphonic acid. Preferred esters are those derived from C1 4alkanols, for example the methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl and n butyl.Also included are esters having a substituted alkyl group in v.ew of the fact that it is often desirable to attach an ester group that cleave to give the free acid, and examples of such substituted alkyls include acetoxymehyl, methylthiomethyl, methoxyethyl, ethoxyethyl, methylsulphinylmethyl and methylsulphonylmethyl. The preferred salts and esters are those which are pharmaceutically acceptable but other derivatives are also included in the invention since they may be useful as intermediates in the preparation, purification or characterisation of the pharmaceutical end product. The invention includes a method of preparing compounds of the invention which comprises reducing a compound of formulaEMI7.1 The reduction is preferably carried out by the use of hydrogen and a metal catalyst, the latter preferably being a precious metal such as platinum or palladium. It has been found that 10 per cent palladium on charcoal is a convenient catalyst for this purpose. Generally the reduction process is carried out in a solvent, for example, acetic acid, and at a temperature from 0 C to 1000 C, for example at room temperature. As mentioned above, the compounds of formula III are known and their method of preparation is described, for example, in British Patents 2 030 142, 2 014 566 and 2 001 631. They may best be prepared by condensing an appropriately substituted benzaldehyde with a benzofuranone as depicted below EMI8.1 compound of formula III It will be appreciated that many of the compounds of the invention can be converted one to another by introduction or conversion of groups in the benzofuranone or phenyl ring either during one of the intermediate stages in the preparative reactions or in an end product. Thus, for example, a tetrazol5 yl compound can be prepared from the corresponding cyano compound by reaction with an azide.When a nitro substituent is desired in the benzofuranone or phenyl nuclei, the corresponding unsubstituted compound can be nitrated with a mixture of concentrated nitric and sulphuric acids by the conventional method. The nitro compound can subsequently be converted to other substituents such as amino or acylamino. The amino compound may be diazotised and the resultant diazonium salt converted to a variety of other products, for example, by decomposition in an alcohol to yield the corresponding alkoxy substituted compound or by reaction with a cuprous halide to yield the corresponding halo substituted compound. Hydroxy substituted compounds can be prepared from the corresponding methoxy compounds by cleavage with, for example, boron tribromide. It will be appreciated that the compounds of the invention have an asymmetric centre at the carbon atom of the benzofuranone moiety linked to the benzyl group carbon number 2 and this asymmetry gives rise to the existence of optical isomers. Substantially pure optical isomer can be prepared by chemical reaction in the presence of a chiral catalyst.Alternatively, a racemic mixture of both isomers can be separated by conventional chemical methods such as for example by the preparation of diastereoisomers as salts with an optically active base and subsequent liberation of the enantiomers. The anti allergy activity of the compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters has been demonstrated in guinea pigs using either the guinea pig chopped lung test described by Mongar and Schild in the Journal of Physiology London 131, 107 1956 or Brocklehurst in the Journal of Physiology London 151, 416 1960 , or the Herxheimer test described in the Journal of Physiology London 117, 251 1952 . In the Herxheimer test, which is based on an allergic bronchospasm induced in guinea pigs closely resembling an asthmatic attack in man, compounds exhibited activity at dosages ranging from 25 mg kg to 200 mg kg. The compounds of the invention have also shown activity in tests devised to indicate anti lammatory activity as, for example, the adjuvant arthritis test B.B. NewbouldChemotherapy of Arthritis Induced in Rats by MycobacterialAdjuvant. Br. J. Pharmacol. 21, 127 136 1963 . The compounds of this invention are accordingly indicated for therapeutic use in the treatment of immediate sensitivity reactions and in particular in the treatment of asthma, as well as being of use in the treatment of antiinflammatory diseases. The compounds of this invention may be administered by various routes, for example, by the oral or rectal route, by inhalation, topically or parenterally, for example by injection, being usually employed in the form of a pharmaceutical composition.Thus the invention includes a method of administering a compound according to formula I to a mammal suffering from an allergic reaction or an inflammatory disease or to prevent such allergic or inflammatory disease. Pharmaceutical compositions also form part of the present invention and are prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art and normally comprise at leat one active compound in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. In making the compositions of the present invention, the active ingredient will usually be mixed with a carrier, or diluted by a carrier, and or enclosed within a carrier which may, for example, be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container.Where the carrier serves as a diluent, it may be a solid, semi solid, or liquid material which acts as a vehicle, excipient or medium for the active ingredient, Thus, the composition may be in the form of tablets, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixires, suspensions, aerosols as a solid or in a liquid medium, ointments containing for example up to 10 by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, injection solutions and suspensions and sterile packaged powders. For administration by inhalation, particular forms of presentation include aerosols, atomisers and vaporisers. Some examples of suitable carriers are lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, syrup, methyl cellulose, methyl and propyl hydroxybenzoate, talc, magnesium stearate and mineral oil. The compositions of the invention may, as is well known in the art, be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient. Where the compositions are formulated in unit dosage form, it is preferred that each unit dosage form contains from 5 mg to 500 g, more usually 25 to 200 mg, of the active ingredient. The term unit dosage form refers to physically discrete units suitable as unit dosages for human subjects and animals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The active compounds are effective over a wide dosage range and, for example, dosages per day will normally fall withing the range of from 0.5 to 300 mg kg, more usually in the range of from 5 to 100 mg kg. However, it will be understood Aiat the amount administered will be determined by the physician in the light of the relevant circumstances including the condition to be treated, the choice of compound to be administered and the chosen route of administration, and therefore the above dosage ranges are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. The following Examples illustrates the invention.EXAMPLES 1 to 3 3 1 2, 3 Dihydro 5 methoxy 3 oxo 2 benzofuranvl methyl0benzoic acid Z 3 1 5 Methoxy 3 oxo 2 3H benzofuranylidene methyl benzoic acid 10 g was suspended in glacial acetic acid 250 ml and hydrogenated at room temperature and 60 p,s.i. pressure in the presence of 10 palladium on charcoal 500 mg for 1 hour.
