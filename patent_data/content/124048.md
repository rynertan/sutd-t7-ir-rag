# Method for producing L tryptophan by fermentation.

## Abstract
A microorganism strain capable of producing L trypto phan, is constructed by inserting a chromosomal DNA frag ment with the genetic information for the L tryptophan biosyn thesis, which has been derived from glutamic acid producing bacteria, into a vector plasmid capable of self replicating in cells of Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria, and in corporating the recombinant plasmid into a DNA recipient be longing to Coryneform glutamicum acid producing bacteria and isolating the transformed strain. By cultivating the obtained strain in a suitable medium L tryptophan is produced in high yields.
