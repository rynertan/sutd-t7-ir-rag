# Digital data reproducing system.

## Abstract
A digital data reproducing system which carries out quantization by the frequency over the transmission rate with respect to waveform distortion created by a group delay caused by ghost and repeater or the like when digital informa tion signals are received to thereby perform waveform equali zation, and which carries out interpolation computation to thereby enable data reproduction about equivalent to that quantized by an ideal sampling timing, thus realizing entire digitization of the data reproducing system.
