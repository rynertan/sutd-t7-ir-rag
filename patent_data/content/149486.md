## Description
This invention relates to an improved motor fuel composition for an internal combustion engine.More particularly, the invention relates to a motor fuel composition effective to inhibit the formation of harmful deposits, for example, on the carburetor of an internal combustion engine. It is well known that internal combustion engine fuels such as gasoline tend to deposit sludge and varnish in the carburetor and engine. Heretofore, there has been continuing interest in developing improved detergents which inhibit the formation of such deposits. Gasoline fuels containing oxygenates have recently become more prevalent and these gasoline fuels can require new compositions as carburetor detergents to obtain optimum results.

Such radicals include the following 1 Hydrocarbon radicals that is, aliphatic e.g., alkyl or alkenyl , alicyclic e.g., cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl , aromatic, aliphatic and alicyclic substituted aromatic, aromatic substituted aliphatic, and alicyclic radicals, and the like. 2 Substituted hydrocarbon radicals that is, radicals containing non hydrocarbon substituents which, in the context of this invention, do not alter the predominantly hydrocarbon character pf the radical. Those skilled in the art will be aware of suitable substituents examples are halo especially chloro and bromo , hydroxy, alkoxy, nitro, carbalkoxy and alkylthio. 3 Hetero radicals that is, radicals which, while predominantly hydrocarbon in character within the context of this invention, contain atoms other than carbon present in a chain or ring.otherwise composed of carbon atoms. Suitable hetero atoms will be apparent to those skilled in the art and include, for example, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. In general, no more than about three substituents or hetero atoms, and preferably no more than one, will be present for each ten carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon based radical. Preferably, the hydrocarbon based radicals inComponent B are free from acetylenic unsaturation and have about 30 to about 5000 carbon atoms, desirably about 5 to about 300 carbon atoms. The radicals are usually hydrocarbon or chloro substituted hydrocarbon. The source of the hydrocarbon based radical is generally a homopolymer or interpolymer of polymerizable olefin monomers containing about two to sixteen and usually about two to six carbon atoms. Illustrative monomers of this type are ethylene, propylene, l butene, 2 butene, isobutene, l octene and l decene. The polymer may also contain units derived from polyenes, including conjugated dienes such as 1,3 butadiene and isoprene nonconjugated dienes such as 1,4 hexadiene, 1,4 cyclohexadiene, 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene and 1,6 octadiene and trienes such as l isopropylidene 3a, 4,7, 7a tetrahydroindene, l isopropylidenecyclopentadiene and 2 2 methylene 4 methyl 3 pentenyl 12 2.1 bicyclo 5 heptene. A first preferred class of polymers comprises those of terminal olefins such as propylene, l butene, isobutene and l hexene. Especially preferred within this class are polybutenes comprising predominantly isobutene units. A second preferred class comprises terpolymers of ethylene, a C38 a monoolefin and a polyene selected from the group consisting of nonconjugated dines which are especially preferred and trienes. Illustrative of these terpolymers is Ortholeum 2052 manv actured by E. I. duPont de Nemours Company, which is a e olymer containing about 48 mole percent ethylene groups, 48 mole percent propylene groups, and 4 mole percent 1,4 hexadiene groups, and having an inherent viscosity of 1.35 8.2 grams of polymer in 100 ml. of carbon tetrachloride at 300C. . The source of the hydrocarbon based radical contains at least about 30 and preferably at least about 50 carbon atoms.Among the olefin polymers, those having a number average molecular weight as determined by gel permeation chromatography of about 700 5000 are preferred, although higher polymers having number average molecular weights from about 10,000 to about 100,000 or higher may sometimes be used. In the alkylation reaction, at least one mole of unsaturated acid or acid derivative is normally used per mole of hydrocarbon based radical source. Particularly when said source contains a substantial number of olefinic bonds, more than one mole of unsaturated acid or acid derivative may be used per mole thereof. The hydrocarbon based radical in the resulting acylating agent should be substantially saturated that is, at least about 95 of the carbon carbon bonds therein should be single bonds. The carboxylic dispersant is prepared by reacting the substituted succinic acid, anhydride or other acrylating agent with at least one of the above identified polar reagents.Suitable nitrogen compounds are those characterized by a radical of the structure NH wherein the two remaining valences of nitrogen are satisfied by hydrogen, in particular, polyamines. The polyamines for preparing Component B are alkylene polyamines and mixtures thereof , including those having the formula EMI7.1 wherein n is an integer between about 1 and 10, preferably between 2 and 8 each A is independently hydrogen or a hydrocarbon or hydroxy substituted hydrocarbon radical having up to about 30 atoms and R2 is a divalent hydrocarbon radical having about 1 18 carbons. Preferably, A is an aliphatic radical of up to about 10 carbon atoms which may be substituted with one or two hydroxy groups, and R1 is a lower alkylene radical having 1 10, preferably 2 6, carbon atoms. Especially preferred are the alkylene polyamines where each A is hydrogen.Such alkylene polyamines include methylene polyamines, ethylene polyamines, butylene polyamines, propylene polyamines, pentylene polyamines, hexylene polyamines and heptylene polyamines. The higher homologs of such amines and related aminoalkyl substituted piperazines are also included. Specific examples of such polyamines include ethylene diamine, triethylene tetramine, tri 5 2 aminoethyl amine, propylene di amine, trimethylene diamine, hexamethylene diamine, decamethylene di amine, octamethylene diamine, di heptamethylene triamine, tripropylene tetramine, tetraethylene pentamine, trimethylene diamine, pentaethylene hexamine, di trimethylene trimine, 2 heptyl 3 2 aminopropyl imidazoline, 1,3 bis 2 aminoethyl imidazoline, 1 2aminopropyl piperazine, 1,4 bis 2 aminoethyl piperazine and 2 methyl 1 2 aminobutyl piperazine. Higher homologs, obtained by condensing two or more of the above illustrated alkylene amines, are also useful. The ethylene polyamines, examples of which are mentioned above, are especially useful for reasons of cost and effectiveness. Such polyamines are described in detail under the heading Diamines and Higher Amines, Aliphatic inKirk Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, ThirdEdition, Vol. 7, pp. 580 602. They are prepared most conveniently by the reaction of an alkylene chloride with ammonia or by reaction of an ethylene imine with a ring opening reagent such as ammonia. These reactions result in the production of the somewhat complex mixtures of alkylene polyamines, including cyclic condensation products such as piperazines. Because of their availability, these mixtures are particularly useful in preparing the compositions of this invention. Satisfactory products can also be obtained by the use of pure alkylene polyamines. Hydroxy polyamines, e.g., alkylene polyamines having one or more hydroxyalkyl substituents on the nitrogen atoms, are also useful in preparing Component B. Preferred hydroxyalkyl substituted alkylene polyamines are those in which the hydroxyalkyl group has less than about 10 carbon atoms.Especially of such hydroxyalkyl substituted polyamines includeN 2 hydroxyethyl ethylene, diamine,N,N bis 2 hydroxyethyl ethylene diamine, 1 2 hydroxyethyl piperazine, monohydroxypropyldiethylene trimine, dihydroxy propyltetraethylene pentamine and N 3 hydroxybutyl tetramethylene diamine. Higher homologs obtained by condensation of the above illustrated hydroxyalkyl substituted alkylene amines through amino radicals or through hydroxy radicals are likewise useful. In the reaction of the acylating agent with the polar compound, it is frequently preferred to employ a substantially inert, normally liquid organic diluent such as benzene, toluene, xylene or naphtha. Typical carboxylic dispersants suitable for use as Component B are listed in Table I by reactants and diluent.
