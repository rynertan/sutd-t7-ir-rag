# Arithmetic circuit with overflow detection capability.

## Abstract
Arithmetic circuit with overflow detection capability in consecutive addition or subtraction operations on data represented in two s complement fixed point notation for use in digital filtering or the like processing. Advantage is taken of the periodical relationship in this representation between the true result value and the one including over flows, so that one overflow in a given direction is compen sated for by a further overflow in the opposite direction. In a first embodiment a single overflow detector 4 is connected to the calculating means 5 performing said operation and feeds a counter 1 which is counted up or down when the most significant bit of a calculation result indicates an overflow occurring in a positive or negative direction, respectively. Upon completion of the operation, the content of said counter 1 determines the existence of a final overflow by means of a zero detecting circuit 2 and its most significant bit indicates the overflow direction. A second embodiment using three flip flops and several gates instead of a counter functions irrespective of the number of consecu tive additions or subtractions but is put into a latched condition by two successive overflows in the same direction.
