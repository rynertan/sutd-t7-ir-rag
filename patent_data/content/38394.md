# Molding powder of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene, process for its preparation.

## Abstract
Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene powder is heated at a temperature between its crystalline melting point and about 275 C for a short period of time ranging from about one minute to about thirty minutes to obtain a molding pow der having properties which facilitate subsequent compres sion molding. Compression molded articles made from the heat treated powder have better transparency, gloss and low temperature mechanical properties than those made from untreated powder.
