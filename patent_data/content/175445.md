# Compressor surge control.

## Abstract
An adaptive gain surge control system 18 for a centrifu gal compressor 14 reacts to both normal and emergency surge conditions by controlling a bypass valve 48 across an inlet and outlet of the compressor in response to a variable gain determined by the offset of a surge control line from the surge line of the compressor.
