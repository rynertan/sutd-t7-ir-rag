# Improved linerless closure.

## Abstract
A linerless closure for use in sealing plastic bottles and jars is disclosed. The linerless closure has a series of concentric annular sealing rings for sealing contact with a bottle mouth. A ridge located between an inner and outer sealing flange provides for a minimum of two sealing surfaces and a maximum of three sealing surfaces with a bottle mouth. A buttress flange spaced inwardly of the inner sealing flange provides additional strength to the inner sealing flange for guiding an irregular bottle mouth to a sealing engagement.
