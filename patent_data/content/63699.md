# Process for the production of high solids concentration pigmentary titanium dioxide slurries and titanium dioxide dispersions.

## Abstract
Stable high concentration aqueous slurries of pigmen tary metal oxide particles having a hydrous oxide surface treatment comprising alumina, for example alumina surface treated pigmentary titanium dioxide, may be formed by the use of a specified combination of anionic and amine dispersants and a milling in the presence of grinding elements, for example in a sand mill, to develop suitable viscosity and gloss characteristics. The slurries may show thixotropic properties and are suitable for incorporation in vinyl silk aqueous emulsion paints.
