# Method for rapid controlled coating of the inner surface of pipes with a tenacious calcite lining.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a method for obtaining a tenacious in situ coating deposition of calcite on the inner surface of water pipes at very high rates. The calcite producing ingredients are supplied to the water stream in quantities supplementing concentrations available in the natural water used, giving the required supersaturation levels by addition of suitable salts to provide an aqueous lining solution supersaturated with respect to calcium car bonate containing dissolved calcium and carbonate ions. The method consists in maintaining the suspended calcium carbonate particles concentrations in the lining solution below 300 ppm, the excess suspended particles being removed by physical means. The calcite coating deposition according to the present invention has the advantage that it occurs at the rate of above 5 microns h and even above 50 microns h, maintaining a completely corrosion free system during the coating. The method is applicable to lead pipes, cement mortar linings or asbestos pipes.
