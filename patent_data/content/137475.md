## Description
This invention relates to laundry prespotting compositions.More particularly, this invention relates to aqueous laundry prespotting compositions having excellent stain removal properties.Current commercially available prespotting compositions fall into two categories, those based primarily upon water and those based primarily upon solvents. The aqueous based prespotting compositions are primarily non aerosol formulations intended for use in trigger spray bottles or squeeze bottles. These aqueous based prespotting compositions have good stain removal characteristics against the so called water borne stains. These stains include grape juice, mustard, grass, chocolate, clay and similar stains.The solvent based composition formulations typically have been packaged in aerosol form. These solvent based compositions typically are more effective in removing oil borne stains, such as cooking oil, fat, spaghetti sauce, sebum, grease, motor oil and the like. It is possible to formulate solvent based prespotting compositions with reasonable water borne stain remover.However, it is desirable to use a composition which has good removal for both water borne and oil borne stains.There have been attemps to replace the solvent with water in prespotter compositions for both aerosol and non aerosol formulation types. One approach is described in U. S. Patent 4,438,009, issued March 20, 1984. The compositions described in this patent are emulsions containing a salt, a nonionic surfactant, from 5 to 60 by weight of a solvent, and water. These compositions are described as having good stain removal properties but these compositions require that some solvent be present for the enhanced stain removal.Another approach is set forth in U. S. Patent 4,079,078, issued March 14, 1978. A typical formulation having certain ingredients corresponding to the teachings of that patent is tested in Example I herein as a comparative formulation. Such compositions require a nonionic surfactant, an anionic surfactant, an alkanolamine, a base, water, a fatty acid corrosion inhibitor, as oleic acid, and optionally, an electrolyte salt to reduce gel formation, such as sodium citrate, and a color stabilizing agent, as citric acid in amounts of up to 1 .Most commerically available liquid prespotting formulations are totally aqueous. These aqueous formulations exhibit good stain removal for the water borne stains but are inferior to solvent based prespotters for oil removal.Most aerosol prespotting formulations and a few liquid formulations are totally non aqueous. These formulations have excellent oil borne stain removal but are less effective against water borne stains. Further these solvent products often contribute to soil redeposition.The object to the present invention to provide an aqueous liquid prespotting composition having superior cleaning properties for both oil and water borne stains. Accordingly, the present invention provides a laundry prespotting colposition comprising a from about 0.1 to 6 by weight of a chelating agent b from about 5 to about 40 by weight of at least one nonionic surfactant wherein the surfactant has an HLB such that the combined HLB for all surfactants present is within the range of from 9 to 13 and c water wherein the composition is substantially solvent free and wherein the composition has a pH within the range of from about 4.5 to 12.2.It has been surprisingly found that the aqueous prespotting composition of the present invention exhibits good cleaning including oil removal and resoil inhibition under most conditions encountered in the home laundry. The prespotting composition of the present invention has cleaning properties equal to or better than solvent containing compositions.The compositions of the present invention are generally liquids of varying viscosities from rather thin compositions suitable primarily for use as pump spray or squeeze bottle spray compositions to rather thick formulations which would have to be spread on the cloth by some alternate method.Still further features and advantages of the composition of the present invention will become more apparent from the following more detailed description thereof.The first component of the compositions to the present invention is a chelating agent. It is thought that the chelating agent functions in the composition to the present invention to assist in removal of certain heavy ions which inhibit the surfactancy of the nonionic surfactants. Also these chelating agents act in concert with the nonionic surfactant so that the surfactant is in the right configuration to attack oily stains from an aqueous system.Suitable chelating agents include the salts of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid EDTA such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid di sodium salt, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid diammonium salt, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid trisodium salt, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tetrasodium salt, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tetrapotassium salt, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tetrammonium salt, etc., the salts of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid DTPA such as diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid pentasodium salt, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid pentapotassium salt, etc., the salts of N hydroxyethyl ethylenediaminetriacetic acid HEDTA such as N hydroxyethyl ethylenedianinetriacetic acid trisodium salt, N hydroxyethyl ethylenediaminetriacetic acid tripotassium salt, etc.8 the salts of nitrilotriacetic acid NTA such as nitrilotriacetic acid trisodium salt, nitrilotriacetic acid tripotassium salt, etc., other chelating agents such as triethanolamine, diethanolamine, monoethanolamine, etc. and mixtures thereof. Preferred chelating agents are the EDTA and the NTA type chelating agents especially the salts of ethylenediaminetretraacetic acid and particularly the tetrasodium, trisodium and disodium salts of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid.Typically the chelating agents are present in the composition of the present invention in an amount of from about 0.1 to 6 by weight. It is within this weight range that the optimum cleaning and prespotting efficiency is obtained. It is perferred that the chelating agents be present in the amount of from about 1.0 to 4 by weight and preferable from 1.5 to 3.0 by weight. The chelating agents, especially the EDTA, DTPA, and HEDTA types, can be added to the composition of the present invention in the salt form, which is prefered since the salts are water soluble, or in the water insoluble free acid form. If the chelating agents are added in the free acid form, the free acids must be at least partially neutralized to make them water soluble and form the chelating agent salts in situ. Suitable bases to neutralize the free acids are sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and ammonium hydroxide. Sufficient base is added to solublize the free acid chelating agent and to bring the pH of the composition within the range of about 4.5 to 12.2. If the chelating agents are added as salts, these salts are often quite basic, having a pli often above 10. It may be necessary to add some acid or other pH buffering material to the composition of the present invention to adjust the pH to within a range of from 4.5 to 12.2 and preferably 6.5 to 8.5 and optimum 7 to 8. Suitable acids include citric acid, oxalic acid, acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric, and the like. The primary function of the acid is to control the pH so that the chelating agent and the surfactants can remove the stains from the fabrics.Certain organic acids also have some chelating properties and therefore may contribute to the overall cleaning efficiency of the prespotting nomposition. Generally the acids, if used, are present in the compositions in the amount of from 0.2 to 2 by weight, however the amount of acid used is not critical.The preferred acid is citric acid.Citric acid may also be employed as a chelating agent, since it possesses chelating properties. For this purpose it is employed in cnelating amounts from about 1.0 to 4.0 by weight and, preferably, from 1.5 to 3.0 by weight. A suitable base can be employed to adjust the pH of the composition to within the preferred range from 6.5 to 8.5 and, optionally, between 7 and 8.Accordingly, citric acid may be employed herein as a first component of the inventive composition to assist in removing heavy ions and or to act in concert with the nonionic surfactant to aid in attacking oily stains. If desired, it is also employed in combination with other chelating agents of the invention to assist in controlling the final pH of the composition, when such other chelating agents are added as salts. The compositions of the present invention also include at least one nonionic surfactant. A single nonionic surfactant having an appropriate HLB can be utilized or mixtures of nonionic surfactants such that the BLB of the resulting mixture of nonionic surfactants is within the appropriate range. It has generally been found that the nonionic surfactant or mixture of nonionic surfactants should have an HLB within the range of from 9 to 13 for optium efficiency. It is perferred that the B1B be between 10 and 12. The optimum HLB range is from 10.5 to 11.5.Suitable nonionic surfactants include the ethoxylated nonylphenols such as the Surfonic N series available fromTexaco Chemicals and the ethoxylated octylphenols including the Triton X series available from Rohm Haas the ethoxylated secondary fatty alcohols such as theTergitol series available from Union Carbide the ethoxylated primary fatty alcohols such as the Neodols available from Shell Chemicals the ethoxylated sorbitan fatty acid esters such as the lseens from ICI America and the sorbitan fatty acid esters such as the Spans from ICIAmerica.The perferred surfactants include the ethoxylated nonylphenols especially those having a degree of ethyloxylation of from 3 to 10 moles of ethylene oxide, the ethoxylated octylphenols expecially those having from 3 to 10 moles of ethylene oxide and the ethoxylated fatty secondary alcohols especially those having from 3 to 10 moles of ethylene oxide. As noted above mixtures of nonionic surfactants, which individually have an HLB outside the range, can be utilized so long as the resultant HLB value of the mixture is within the range as set forth above. It is within this fiLB range that the stain removal properties of the composition of the present invention are at a maximum. Outside this range there is not sufficient oil and water dispersibility to provide suitable stain removing properties.Generally it has been found that the nonionic surfactants which are water dispersible have the best stain removal properties in the compositions of the present invention. it is thought that water dispersible surfactants act both against oil and water borne stains.Generally the composition should include from 5 to 40 by weight of at least one nonionic surfactant and preferably from 5 to 208 by weight and optimally 7 to 20 by weight of at least one nonionic surfactant.The compositions of the present invention are characterized as being substantially solvent free. By the term substantially solvent free1 is meant a composition which contains less than 1 by weight of an organic water immiscible solvent such as isoparaffinic hydrocarbons, deodorized kerosene, d limonene, the chlorinated solvents such as perchloroethylene, methylene chloride, etc., This term is meant to exclude those non polar water insoluble solvents typically used in stain removal compositions.The compositions of the present invention can also include small additional amounts of other conventional materials including perfumes, defoamers, bacteriacides, bacterstats and the like. Generally these materials are present in amounts of less than 2 by weight based on the amount of the composition.Although the compositions of the present invention are primarily designed for use as prespotting compositions, these compositions can also be use as laundry detergents or cleaning agents. These compositions can be used as heavy duty liquid laundry cleaning compositions. The compositions of the present invention can be prepared by any conventional means. Suitable methods include cold blending or other mixing processes. It is not necessary to use high shear or other strenuous mixing techniques to prepare the compositions of the present invention.The prespotting compositions of the present invention will now be illustrated by way of the following examples where all part percentages are by weight and all temperatures and degrees celeius unless otherwise indicated.

Triethanolamine 8.0 gms. Melt all the components of Part A together at 120 1300 F.Add Part d to Part A with agitation while hot until homogeneous. At this time, 12 grams of air filter dirt 200 mesh is added and agitated for 10 minutes. From 50 100 ml of 1200 F deionized water is added with agitation and stirred for 10 minutes. From 900 950 ml to total 1000 ml of 1200 F deionized water is added and agitated until the temperature of the mixture drops to 1100 F. The mixture is agitated in a Gifford WoodHomogenizer for 10 minutes or until 1200 F. Pour the mixture through cheesecloth and store in 100 F oven. Example BGrass stain slurry is prepared by placing 50 grams of fresh grass clippings and 500 grams of water in a blender and gradually increasing the speed to uify . Add isopropyl alcohol as needed up to 50 grams to reduce foaming and blend for 20 minutes Add remainder of isopropyl alcohol to 50 grams total and mix for 5 minutes. Strain through a 40 mesn screen and keep refrigerated until use. Example 1A liquid prespotting composition having the following composition was prepared Water 84.1 , Nonylphenol ethyloxylate 6 moles ethylene oxide Surfonic N 60 10 Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, tetrasodium salt 40 actives 5 Citric acid 50 actives 0.9 100.0 This formulation was mixed and then placed into a squeeze bottle having a fountain type cap for testing. The composition had a pH of 7.9. The formulation was tested on 4 types of white cloth swatches 100 cotton, 65 35 polyester cotton, 50 50 polyester cotton, and 1008 polyester. Each swatch was stained with 7 stains, used motor oil, mustard, grape juice, chocolate, a 20 clay slurry, artificial sebum Example AX, and grass slurry Example B .The swatches were saturated with the above formulation and allowed to sit for 1 minute. The swatches were then washed with Tide detergent available fromProcter Gamble with a dummy load of cotton towels. The stain removal characteristics were rated on a 5 point scale with 1 being essentially no removal and 5 being complete removal. The above formulation is compared to a liquid prespotter formulation comparative containing 2 sodium citrate, 8 of a C12 C15 ethoylated alcohol 7 moles ethylene oxide , 2.4 sodium xylene sulfonate and 87.6 water.
