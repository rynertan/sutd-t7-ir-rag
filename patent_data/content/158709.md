# A process for producing a para substituted phenol derivative.

## Abstract
By reacting, using as a catalyst a modified or unmodified cyclodextrin, a phenol compound with an organic halide se lected from the group consisting of a carbon tetrahalide and a substituted or unsubstituted allyl halide in the presence of an alkali metal hydroxide, a substituent group derived from said organic halide can be introduced to the para position of the phenol compound with high selectivity, whereby various useful para substituted phenol derivatives can be advanta geously obtained.
