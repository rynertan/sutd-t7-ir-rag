# Methods of using selective optical excitation in deposition processes and the detection of new compounds.

## Abstract
The present invention generally relates to the use of fluo rescence signals obtained by selective optical excitation to detect and monitor a species present during a flow reac tion or decomposition of various reactants. These reactions were analyzed in situ using a tunable laser as a selective excitation source in combination with a reactor inducing such reactions with a diffusion flame or a plasma. The resul tant spectra and analysis presented herein demonstrates the detection of new compositions like SiHF in the gas phase. The invention allows for pinpoint spatial probing of the reactor without perturbing the reaction. Thus, a deposi tion process can be controlled by monitoring a selected species and adjusting the deposition reaction parameters in response to the species mere detection or relative concen tration. The invention also contemplates perturbing deposi tion reactions by selectively exciting a species present in the deposition reaction to modify the deposited material so that the quality of the deposited material improves. Specifi cally, improved photovoltaic devices which include photo conductive material made in accordance with the present invention are disclosed herein.
