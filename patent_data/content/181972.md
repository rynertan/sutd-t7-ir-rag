## Description
Rotary Pumps or Engines This invention relates to rotary pumps or engines. Rotary pumps or engines are described, for example, inGB 677 674. This describes a rotary pump or engine comprising a stator consisting of a closed casing, a shaft supported eccentrically in said casing, and a rotor provided with blades pivotally connected at their inner ends to the periphery of the rotor, wherein the chamber in the casing is of generally oval shape. Hitherto, rotary pumps and engines have been complicated and expensive to produce. I have now devised a rotary pump or engine which is simple in design and easy and cheap to manufacture. Thus, in one aspect the present invention provides a rotary pump or engine of the eccentric chamber and pivoting vane type comprising a plurality of parallel plates to thereby define one or more eccentric chambers, said plates being compressed together, and one or more vanes within said one or more eccentric chambers pivoted at one end to a core member and having pivoted tip members at the other end, said core member rotating relative to said one or more eccentric chambers. In the pump or engine of the invention working media such as air, steam or other fluids or mixtures thereof may be worked upon or work in volumes of variable capacity formed by curved vanes oscillating within chambers of rectangular cross section. The bodies of the pumps or engines of the invention contain the chambers of variable capacity which are formed by a series of laminated parallel chamber plates, dividing plates and end plates held together by a number of tension members passing through the plates. This type of construction enables conventional machine tools to be used for the production of the pump or engine parts, and the simplicity of the design will permit low costs of manufacture. The vanes of the pump or engine of the invention are preferably curved, pivoted at one end to a core member and have a pivoted tip member at the other end. The vanes conveniently taper from their pivot end towards their tip members. The vanes in accordance with this invention lie in chambers formed in plates of the same thickness as the vanes and have dividing plates on at least one side of each chamber. The chamber in each chamber plate is the result of an eccentric circle or other profiled form cut from through the full depth of the chamber plate, the inner surface of which forms the peripheral surface of the chamber. The chamber plates and their respective divider plates together with the endplates in which the bearings of the pump or engine are located, form a series of parallel plates or a laminated assembly. The variable volumes formed by relative rotational movement of the vanes within their chambers enable the device to act as a pump or engine. The body of the pump or engine generally consists of a laminated assembly of plates being the end plates containing the bearings of the machine and between these, the alternate chamber plates and dividing plates according to the number of chambers desired for the particular machine. However, a small version of the machine may have only one chamber plate between endplates and bearings. If desired, fluid delivery valves or intake ports may be positioned in the side or endplates of the pump, or alternatively valves may be provided to pass e.g. compressed air or gas into a central hollow shaft. The vanes may conveniently be provided with light springs to keep the vane tips in contact with the chamber peripheral surface when pivoting outwards. As relative movement takes place between the chamber plate and the vanes, the eccentric surface of the chamber forces the vane to pivot inwards. The pivoting tip of the vane itself forms a pressure operated seal, and the sides of the vanes may also have pressure operated seals. In rotating body pumps fluid may be drawn through radial ducts formed between the chamber peripheral surface and the utter surface of the chamber p ate. In stationary body pumps fluid may be drawn through ports or grilles located in the dividing or endpjates of the pump. In either case the ducts, ports or grilles for fluid entry are so positioned that the relevant vane will close such openings when that vane begins to pivot inwards under the pressure of the chamber plate eccentric surface. At the point of minimum eccentricity for each chamber plate, a conventional spring pressure seal may be provided through the full depth of the chamber. Each chamber may have one, two or more vanes and a complete machine may have one or more chambers. The rotational axis of a pump or engine according to this invention may be vertical, horizontal or in any other plane. Rotary steam engines according to this invention preferably comprise a stationary outer body comprising the laminated assembly of plates previously described, with an inner rotor carrying the vanes which lie in chambers and between dividing plates and or end plates as already described. In this embodiment the inner peripheral surfaces of the chamber plates are generally not in the form of eccentric circles but have profiles designed to obtain optimum benefit of steam expansion and are offset in relation to the central axis. A feature of engines in accordance with this invent on is that relative movement between vanes and chamber surface is opposite to the relative movement when functioning as pumps, which means that for engines, the pivot end of the vane is leading and the vane tip trailing within a stationary outer body. For use as a steam engine the width and depth of tiie chambers conveniently differ one from another and the dividing plates between chambers preferably incorporate ports designed to permit optimum transfer of steam from one chamber to an adjacent chamber. In the design of a three ch3mber.steam engine according to one embodiment of this invention, the machine could conveniently be a triple expansion rotary steam engine. The steam may be admitted to the first chamber either via a tangential port or via ports in the rotor and hollow central shaft similar to an air engine or internal combustion engine application of this invention. Thus the first chamber is a high pressure HP chamber and within the chamber may be one or more vanes, preferably three, each being attached to the rotor by its pivot pin at an angular separation of 1200. When one of the HP vanes has moved through approximately 1200 under pressure of throttleadmitted steam, it uncovers a port in the dividing plate allowing the steam to pass into the adjacent intermediate pressure IP chamber.The width and depth of this chamber are generally greater than those of the HP chamber. The IP chamber has the same number of vanes in it similarly attached to the rotor by their pivot pins, but at positions in advance of those in the HP chamber. When the dividing plate port is uncovered, the relevant vane in the IP chamber is in a position to receive beneficially the steam from the HP chamber.Meanwhile the next or following vane in the HP chamber is under the influence of a fresh volume of steam whilst the back or leading side of the same HP vane is scavenging the chamber ahead of it into the adjacent IP chamber via the open port in the dividing plate. The third chamber in this design is the low pressure LP chamber, the width and depth of the chamber being again greater than those of the adjacent IP chamber. This LP chamber also accommodates the same number of vanes as in the preceding chambers, and here again the vanes are attached to the rotor hy their pivot pins but in advance of the vanes in the IP chamber so that the relevant vane in the LP tract receives beneficially the steam passing out of the IP chamber when the appropriate vane in the IP chamber uncovers the port in the dividing plate between the IP and LP chambers.The function of following vanes in both IP and LP chambers is as described for the HP and IP chambers except that radial exhaust ports may be formed in the LP plate through which steam may pass to a condenser. A triple expansion rotary steam engine in accordance with one embodiment of this invention has been described above but a single chamber steam motor is equally applicable whilst a multiple chamber rotary steam engine will follow the same principles of construction and operation. As a rotary air motor or internal combustion engine, the outer body comprising the laminated assembly of plates is also conveniently stationary while the centre portion consists of a rotating rotor. In this case also, the chamber peripheral surfaces may be not in the form of eccentric circles but have profiles designed to obtain optimum benefit of air or gas expansion, and offset in relation to the central axis. The air or gas entry port may be in the expansion portion of the relevant chamber fed from a rotary sleeve valve, in which case the shaft of the machine rotates and drives the rotary sleeve valve. In a further embodiment of the design, the rotor rotates on a stationary hollow shaft and air or gas entry is via a curved duct or ducts in the rotor admitting air or gas from the stationary hollow shaft. The relevant ports in the hollow shaft and rotor are so positioned as to align at a predetermined position in the rotation of the rotor to give optimum entry and expansion of compressed air or gas. Air motors or internal combustion engines in accordance with this invention may have one or more chambers, and the chambers may have one or more vanes. However, I have found that in air motors or internal combustion engines, the preferred number of vanes is two in each chamber positioned on the rotor with pivot pins at an angular separation of 1800. When intended as an air motor or internal combustion engine, injector and or ignition equipment are generally provided in the chamber plate where expansion begins to take place. The chamber plates are generally designed to provide optimum flame propagation. Embodiments of the invention are hereinafter described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a cross section through an air compressor or fluid pump in accordance with the invention Figure 2 is a cross section through a triple expansion steam engine in accordance with the invention Figure 3 is a cross section through an air motor or internal combustion engine in accordance with the invention and Figure 4 is a section along the line A B of the pump illustrated in Figure 1. The positive displacement pump illustrated in Figures 1 and 3 comprises an outerbody 1 consisting of a laminated assembly of chamber plates 2, dividing plates 3 and endplates 4, which are held in compression by tension members e.g. screws or bolts 5 all of which rotate about a stationary core 6. Each chamber plate 2 has curved radial air intake ducts 7 formed in the advancing sector of the chamber eccentric, and has two curved vanes 8 in it. In this diagram of a three chamber compressor, the other two chambers are indicated by dotted line eccentric circles with vanes not shown for clarity. Each chamber plate has a conventional spring pressure seal 9 through the full depth of the chamber at the position of minimum eccentricity. The vanes have hinged tip members 10 and the complete vanes are attached by pivot pins 11 to the stationary core. The core comprises segments, one to each chamber which are keyed onto the central hollow shaft 12 with keys 13 and are held together by threaded members e.g. screws or bolts 14 parallel to the shaft 12. Between the core segments and held in compression by threaded members 14 are pairs of metal rings 15 and nipped between them a flexible diaphragm 16, having tapered edges and of larger diameter than rings 15. The rings 15 are so positioned as to align with the dividing plates 3 which have vee section grooves machined into their inner bore. The tapered edge of the diaphragm 16 projects into the vee section groove to provide inter chamber sealing. The segments of the core 6 are fitted with valves 17 to allow air in the diminishing space of the chamber to pass into the bore of the hollow shaft 12. The triple expansion rotary steam engine shown in Figure 2 comprises a laminated outer body 21 comprising chamber plates 22, dividing plates not shown and endplates not shown held in compression by tension members 23. In this embodiment the body 21 is stationary. Long dowels 24, split longitudinally, serve to locate chamber plates and dividing plates accurately in relation to one another. A tangential steam entry port 25 is formed in a HP chamber plate through which steam enters the HP chamber. Three vanes 26, each having a pivoting tip member 27 are attached by pivot pins 28 to rotor 29 which is carried on hollow shaft 30 and bearings located in endplates not shown . The dividing plate between the HP chamber and adjacentIP chamber has a port which is uncovered to allow steam transfer at 1400 as shown in Figure 2. The vanes in the IP chamber are a number of degrees in advance of vanes in the HP chamber. The dividing plate between the IP chamber and the subsequentLP chamber similarly has a port which is uncovered at 2900.Steam transfer then again occurs and the third expansion of steam takes place in the LP chamber from which it escapes radially via exhaust ducts 31 formed in the LP plate, which could incorporate a manifold passing the steam to a condenser. In the air motor or internal combustion engine shown inFigure 3, the vanes 40 with their hinged tips 41, lie in their corresponding chamber 42, being hinged on their pivot pins 43 and attached thereby to a rotor 44 which is carried on bearings located in endplates not shown of laminated stationary body 45, held together by tension members 46. A sparking plug or fuel injector for igniting or supplying combustible gas for an internal combustion engine is mounted in a threaded hole 50 through each of the chamber plates. In this embodiment the rotor rotates on a stationary hollow shaft 47, and compressed air or combustible gas supplied to the end or ends of hollow shaft 47 passes via ports in stationary hollow shaft 47, and ducts 48 in rotor 44 into the expansion or combustion portion of chamber 42. An alternative method of air or gas entry is from a rotary sleeve valve lying across the planes of the chamber plates through suitably shaped ports in the expansion portion of the chamber and is driven directly from the main shaft which rotates with the rotor. Products of combustion or expanded air escape via ducts 49 formed radially in the chamber plate.
