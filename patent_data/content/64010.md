# SYSTEM AND PROCESS FOR AUTOMATIC WIRE WELDING

## Abstract
This wire welding electrode assembly, wire welding system and wire welding process utilizes the wire to be welded as one of the welding electrodes. The system and process provides a welded segment of wire between weld ing tabs and external terminals of an electronic circuit package with a ceramic substrate of the package assembled in its housing. Pivotal cutting blades are provided in the system for cutting the wire after it has been welded between two points. The system is preferably programmable to accommodate a variety of welding tab and terminal confi gurations in different packages.
