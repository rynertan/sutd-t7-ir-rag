# Joining silicon nitride to metals.

## Abstract
The problem of joining silicon nitride to a metal or metal alloy is overcome by bonding a surface of the silicon nitride to a layer of aluminium oxide or an aluminium silicon compound or magnesia or magnesium oxide or mullite, then bonding that first layer to a layer of nickel alumina before joining the nickel alumina to the metal or metal alloy by a conventional brazing or welding process. This has the further advantage of accommodating the widely differing coeffi cients of thermal expansion between the silicon nitride and the metal by the provision of materials between them which have graded coefficients of thermal expansion between the two extreme coefficients of thermal expansion. The method can be used to produce pistons having silicon nitride crown portions joined to aluminium or aluminium alloy piston bodies or to produce gas turbine blade assemblies having silicon nitride aerofoils joined to a metal root.

## Description
JOINING SILICON NITRTDE TO METALSThe invention relates to the joining of silicon nitride to metals and to articles produced by such joining.Silicon nitride is more heat resistant than many metals such as the aluminium and aluminium alloys used in the manufacture of articles such as pistons for internal combustion engines, and the nickel and cobalt alloys used in the manufacture of blades for gas turbine engines, both of which work in a hot environment.Silicon nitride is comparatively strong at high temperatures, having a modulus of rupture of about 206 kPa. at temperatures up to 13500C. There are several forms of silicon nitride which can be so used such as reaction bonded sili Ca mitride, in which a silicon powder is compacted and reacted with nitrogen at high temperature, or hot pressed silicon nitride, which is a silicon nitride powder pressed in graphite dies at high temperature and bonded together with a glass flux, or sintered silicon nitride, which is a silicon nitride powder heated in the presence of a bonding agent such as ytrea and a magnesia so that the particles stick together, or a compound known as sialon, which is silicon nitride with oxygen and aluminium. In many articles, however, such as pistons and gas turbine blade assemblies, it is not possible to make the whole article of silicon nitride because of the loads imposed on the article. For this reason, it is desirable to join silicon nitride to metals. It has not, however, so far been possible to establish such a joint by conventional welding or brazing processes because silicon nitride does not wet i.e. it will not carry a liquid film on its surface and so it is not possible to coat it with conventional fluxes or other metal compounds which allow welding or brazing of the silicon nitride to the metal. Silicon nitride will, under certain circumstances, wet with highly reactive brazes based on titanium and chromium, but these require the use of a high vacuum furnace which is expensive to operate, produces an expansion mismatch and can give generally poor quality joints.According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of joining silicon nitride to a metal or metal alloy and comprising bonding to a surface of the silicon nitride, firstly a layer of aluminium oxide or an alumina silica compound or magnesia or magnesium oxide or mullite and secondly a layer of a ceramic metal and then joining the ceramic metal layer to a surface of the metal or metal alloy by a welding or brazing process.According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a piston having a crown end thereof or a part of the crown end thereof formed from silicon nitride and the remainder of the piston formed from a metal or a metal alloy and comprising joining the silicon nitride part to the metal or metal alloy portion by a method according to the first aspect of the invention. e According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a blade for a gas turbine engine and comprising forming an aerofoil portion of the blade of silicon nitride and forming a root portion of the blade of a metal or a metal alloy and then joining the aerofoil portion to the root portion by a method according to the first aspect of the invention.The following is a more detailed description of two embodiments of the invention, by way of example, reference being made to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a cross section of a portion of a piston for an internal combustion engine, andFigure 2 is a schematic perspective view of a part of a bade for a gas turbine engine.Referring first to Figure 1, the piston for an internal combustion engine mprises a body portion 10 which is, for example, cast from aluminium or an aluminium alloy or a magnesium alloy. The end of the body has a flat generally circular surface 11.The piston also includes a combustion bowl 12 formed in a crown end member 13 of silicon nitride Si3N4 in any suitable form, such as reaction bonded silicon nitride, in which a silicon powder is compacted and reacted with nitrogen at high temperature, or hot pressed silicon nitride, which is a silicon nitride powder pressed in grapnite dies at high temperature and bonded together with a glass flux, or sintered silicon nitride, which is a silicon nitride powder heated in the presence of a bonding agent such as ytrea and a magnesia so that the particles stick together, or a compound known as sialon, which is silicon nitride with oxygen and aluminium. The member 13 is provided with a peripheral flange 14 which has the same external diameter as the external diameter of the body 10.An annular reinforcement member 15 of a ferrous material is provided around the silicon nitride member 13 beneath the flange 14 and has an external diameter which is substantially the same as the external diameters of the flange 14 and the piston body 10.The silicon nitride member 13 is connected to the other parts as follows.First, the cylindrical surface 16 of the silicon nitride member 13 is sprayed with a layer of aluminium oxide A1203 . This may be done by using a plasma spray process or by any other suitable form of spray. In alternative embodiments, alumina silica compounds or magnesia or magnesium oxides or mullite A168i2O13 may be used.The use of a plasma a spray process ensures that the aluminium oxide is bonded firmly to the surface of the silicon nitride member 13.Next, a layer of a ceramic metal such as nickel aluminide is sprayed onto the coating of aluminium oxide. Once again, a plasma spray process may be used or any other suitable form of spray process to ensure the formation of a firmly bonded layer. Since nickel aluminide can be welded or brazed to metals using conventional such processes, the coated silicon nitride member 13 is then brazed to the reinforcement 15 by a conventional brazing process using a brazing paste to form a connection 17 therebetween. The assembled member 13 and the reinforcement 15 are then brazed to the upper surface 11 of the piston body 10 in a similar 20 fashion. Subsequently, a ring groove or grooves are machined in the reinforcement 15 to produce a finished piston. In this way, a piston is formed which has a crown end and a combustion bowl 12 formed from silicon nitride which can readily resist the temperatures of, say, up to 8000C which. may be found in the cylinders of internal combustion engines, particularly Diesel cycle engines with a heat insulated piston. The joining method described above. with reference to Figure 1 provides a connection between the silicon nitride member 11, the body 10 and the reinforcement 15 which is strong enough to take all loads imposed on the piston. The problem of differing coefficients of thermal expansion between the silicon nitride member 13 and the piston body 10 and the reinforcement 15 is overcome by the fact that the aluminium oxide or alumina silica compound or magnesia or magnesium oxide mullite, where used has a coefficient of thermal expansion intermediate the coefficients of thermal expansion of the member 13 and the body and reinforcement 10, 15, while the nickel aluminide has a coefficient of thermal expansion intermediate the coefficients of thermal expansion of the aluminium oxide and the body 10 and reinforcement 15. Thus there is a succession of materials with graded coefficients of thermal expansion which overcomes the problem of direct joints between materials having widely differing coefficients of thermal expansion.It will be appreciated that a welding process can be used in place of the brazing process described above.Referring next to Figure 2, the. blade comprises an aerofoil portion 20 which is formed from a silicon nitride of any of the types described above with reference to Figure 1. The aerofoil portion 20 is provided with a rectangular base 21 which forms part of the gas shroud platform and has a flat undersurface.The blade also includes a fir tree root 22 which is formed from any suitable metal or metal alloy such as a nickel or cobalt alloy and having a rectangular upper surface 23 forming the remainder of the gas shroud platform and corresponding to the flat undersurface of the base 21 of the aerofoil portion 20.The two surfaces are joined using the . technique described above with reference to Figure 1. The undersurface of the silicon nitride aerofoil portion 20 is sprayed with a layer of aluminium oxide or an alumina silica compound, or a magnesium oxide or mullite. Onto this layer is sprayed a ceramic metal such as nickel aluminide which is, in turn, welded or brazed to the upper surface 23 of the root 22.There is thus formed a composite gas turbine blade in which the silicon nitride aerofoil 20 is well able to wst sland the hot conditions encountered in the turbine in operation, while the metal or metal alloy root 22 is well able to bear the stresses placed on tne blade. This avoids the stressing problems encountered in the roots of blades formed entirely from silicon nitride.The graded coefficients of thermal expansion of the layers overcome the problem of differential expansion of the aerofoil and the root.It will be appreciated that composite silicon nitride metal or metal alloy parts, joined as described above, could be used for form other gas turbine parts which encounter the hot turbine gases and are stressed in use. For example, composite turbine shrouds and other hot gas path components could be made in this way.Indeed, the method described can be used whenever it is required to join silicon nitride to a metal or metal alloy.
