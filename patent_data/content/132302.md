# POLYETHER POLYOLS FROM MIXED INITIATORS

## Abstract
Polyether polyols suitable for the production of flexible polyurethane foams having improved load bearing proper ties are obtained by reacting one of more alkylene oxides with a mixture of initiators comprising 1 60 to 90 weight of a trifunctional partially alk oxylated initiator, and 2 10 to 40 weight of a secondary partially alk oxylated initiator having an active hydrogen functionality of from 4 to 8. Preferably, the triol initiator is partially alkoxylated, the higher functional alkoxylated initiator is added, and the resulting mixture is further alkoxylated.
