# Improvements in coating methods.

## Abstract
A method of coating a support 1 with microcapsules, especially in manufacturing pressure sensitive recording paper, by dispensing hydrophobic walled microcapsules in water, applying the dispersion to the support 1 and removing excess dispersion by passing the support 1 past a flexible blade 5 thereby also to spread and smooth the coating.
