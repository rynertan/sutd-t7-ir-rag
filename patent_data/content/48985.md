# Process for cellular polyurethane formation using tertiary amine catalyst mixtures.

## Abstract
Tertiary amine catalyst mixtures comprising at least one hydroxyalkyl piperazine, preferably 2 hydroxyethyl piperazine or 1,4 di 2 hydroxyethyl piperazine, and at least one other tertiary amine for increasing the pro cessability of hydroxyalkyl piperazine in controlling the water isocyanate reaction rate to obtain optimum per formance in cellular polyurethane foam formulations and or enhancing the compatibility of hydroxyalkyl pi perazine with other foaming ingredients in flexible poly ester polyurethane foam formulation and a process for producing cellular polyurethanes, such as flexible polyester or polyether polyurethane foam and high re silience polyether polyurethane foam, by effecting the reaction of an organic polyol reactant and an organic polyisocyanate reactant in the presence of a blowing agent and said tertiary amine catalyst mixture, the re sulting cellular polyurethanes exhibiting very low resi dual amine odor.
