# Process and apparatus for preparing finely divided silicon dioxide in good yield.

## Abstract
Process and apparatus are provided for preparing finely divided silicon dioxide in goo yield by reaction of silicon fluoride in the vapor phase with water vapor, combustible gas and free oxygen containing gas in a flame reaction zone to form hydrogen fluoride and silicon dioxide entrained in a gaseous reaction mixture withdrawing the gaseous reaction mixture from the flame reaction zone and then immediately and rapidly cooling the gaseous reaction mixture and entrained silicon dioxide to a temperature below 700 C by passing the gaseous reaction mixture in a turbulent flow at a Reynolds number above 300 under constraint through a straight narrow passage in alignment with the gas flow, the passage having a diameter within the range from about 20 to about 150 mm and smooth walls constituting a cooling surface.
