# RATIO DISCRIMINATOR

## Abstract
A radio discriminator is disclosed which can provide an exact indication of the achievement of tuning and is unaf fected by drifts and variations in the components or supply or reference voltages. The discriminator includes a modu lated signal input 1 , an intermediate frequency circuit com prising first and second tuned oscillating circuits 2,3 , wherein the first circuit 2 is connected to the input 1 and the second oscillating circuit 3 has a secondary winding 10 equipped with an intermediate tap 11 connected to a first terminal 30 of a tertiary winding 12 and a detector circuit 4 having an output terminal 5 . The tertiary winding 12 is at a reference DC voltage, at a second terminal 31 thereof, and connected with its first terminal 30 to the output ter minal 5 .
