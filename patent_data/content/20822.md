# Current detector circuit.

## Abstract
Current detector circuit which first comprises two identical transformers, with the primary windings thereof connected in series and the secondary windings thereof connected in opposition, but in series with that circuit in which it is desired to detect the current, and in which the primary windings comprise the load of the collector of an NPN transistor, said collector being connected through a resistor to the base of a PNP transistor the emitter of which is connected to the positive supply line and the collector is connected to the negative line through a resistor condenser cell, the NPN transistor emitter being connected to the negative line through a condenser cell and the NPN transistor base biased by means of a resistive divider connected to the positive line, is fed back from the collector through two condensers in series, the condenser junction being also connected to the positive line through a resistor.
