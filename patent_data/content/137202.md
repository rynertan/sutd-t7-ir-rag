# Rotary rock drilling chuck.

## Abstract
A chuck for a drilling machine is fitted to a retractable spindle. Plungers 25 carried by a yoke 26 move when the yoke 26 abuts the front end 20 of the machine. This charges an accumulator carried inside the chuck body. Opening a valve causes the chuck jaws to clamp while closing the valve and opening another valve causes the chuck jaws to relax.
