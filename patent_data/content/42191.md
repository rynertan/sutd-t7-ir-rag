## Description
Tailgate loading packer for a collecting bodyThe invention relates to a tailgate loading packer for a collecting body, comprising a trough shaped bottom provided with upright sidewalls, above which bottom a packer plate is movable for advancing the material dumped on the troughshaped bottom to the collecting body, this packer plate being connected with drive means provided with hydraulic cylinder piston systems by means of portions projecting through grooves into the sidewalls as is nown fromUS Patent 3.297.180. These tailgate loading packers are applied in vehicles adapted to collect refuse which is dumped from containers or in the form of filled bags onto the trough shaped bottom. By means of the packer plafe the material can be scraped off the trough shaped bottom and compressed in the collecting body. In the known installation the portions of the packer plate projecting through the sidewalls are supported rotatably on the free ends of relatively long rocker arms which are arranged on the outside against the widewalls of the tailgate loading packer. Hydraulic piston systems operate on these rocker arms for moving the rocker arms both ways at a certain angle.Moreover, the portions connected to the plate and projecting through the grooves are provided with an arm projecting outside the tailgate loading packer on which arm another set of hydraulic cylinder piston systems engage so as to allow the packer plate to rotate with respect to the rocker arms.This tgilgate loading packer has the disgdvantage that a relatively long overhanging superstructure is required, while it is difficult to enay relatively high and tall containers for the refuse onto the trough shaped bottom since the plate or a movable cross wall cooperating with the plate means an impediment. It is another disadvantage of this known installation that, if it is desired to adapt the plate as a comb, the movement of the plate is such that the teeth of the comb cannot be cleaned. The comb shaped of the packer plate is desirable because it should be possible to tear up the plastic bags in which the refuse is packed.A tailgate loading packer which does allow this is known frcm Dutch patent application 72 13152. The packer plate is provided with a comb shaped portion and the teeth of this comb shaped portion extend, at the end of the compres sing stroke, between teeth of a fixed plate on the front of the tailgate loader. Upon retraction of the packer plate the teeth of the fixed plate slip along the teeth of the combshaped portion, so that no material may accumulate between the teeth.For this purpose, the packer plate with its teeth is rota tably arranged around a rotatable shaft, the rotatable shaft possessing two cranks arranged in even line with each other which support the shaft. On these cranks two cylinder piston systems engage which are mutually arranged at a different angle t allowing an angular displacement over 3600.Moreover, near the sidewalls of the tailgate loader, guides are arranged to the packer plate, these guides cooperating with shoes which are mounted rotatably in the sidewalls of the toilgate loader. As a result thereof, the points of the teeth of the comb shaped portion of the packer plate des cribe a conchoid. Upon retraction of the packer plate the teeth run along the teeth of the fixed plate Moreover, this embodiment allows a very short collecting body since no portions of the plate impede the emptying of containers.However, the arrangement of the cylinder piston systems at different angles so os to allow the cranks to rotate over 3600 is a disadvantage of this known installation. As a result thereof, there arise undesired frictions because the cylinder piston system on the one side of the tailgate loader has a dead point other than that of the cylinderpiston system on the other side of the tailgate loader.It is the object of the invention to,provide a tailgate loader, which is adapted to the handling of refuse which is supplied in plastic bags or in containers, which allows a relatively light construction and possesses a very short tailrange, without the disadvantages of the known installations.According to the invention this is realized with a tailgate loader of the type described at the beginning which is characterized in that on each side of the installation the packer plate with the portion extending through the groove is supported on a serially pivotally connected rod system one rod of which is a rocker arm supported on the sidewall, which packer plate, at a distance from its pivotal support, is connected pivotally with a rocker rod which forms part of the rod system, which rocker rod is again pivotally connected with another rocker arm which also forms part of the rod system, and in that each rocker arm cooperates with a hydraulic cylinder piston system belonging thereto.The advantage thereof is not only that the above mentioned disadvantages are removed but also that a particularly favourable track of movement of the packer plate may be brought about in which the points of the teeth of the comb shaped portion of the packer plate move relatively high over the material dumped on the trough shaped bottom and a controlled force may always be exercised also at the dead points of the cylinder piston systems. It is another advantage thereof that the installation can operate continuously because in dumping of refuse no impediment by the plate is experienced.The invention will be explained with reference to the accompanying drawing in which Fig. 1 is a vertial section through a tailgate loader according to the invention with a packer plate at the end of its track of movement for the compression Fig. 2 shows the same section as in Fig. 1 with the packer plate at the end of its track of movement for lifting it Fig. 3 shows the same section as in Fig. 1 but with the packer plate at the end of its track of movement for swinging outward, andFig. 4 shows the same section as in Fig. 1 but with the packer slate at the end of its track of movement for penetrating into the material. The tailgat e loader according to the invention compris es a trough shaped bottom 1 which is arranged between two sidewalls running parallel to each other of which one sidewall 2 is shown in the drawing. At the rear the trough shaped bottom possesses a stiffening box profile 3 and on the front side a similar stiffening box profile 4. This foremost stiffening box profile 4 joins an aftermost and undermost edge 5 of a collecting body of a vehicle. At the top of this collecting body the tailgate loader is suspended by means of the pivots 6. On the frontside the tailgate loader is provided with a cross wall 7 which closesthe passage to the collecting body. Near the lower end Rthe cross wall a stiffening box 8 has been provided against which teeth 9 are arranged at a distance from each other.Between and under these teeth 9 there is provided a passage for the material dumped on the trough shaped bottom. By means of a packer plate which is generally indicated by 10, this material can be advanced from the trough shaped bottom 1 underneath the teeth 9 and via the passage provided herev to the collecting body of the vehicle and be compressed in this collecting body. So, the tailgate loader for the collecting body comprises a trough shaped bottom 1 provided with upright sidewalls 2, above which bottom a packer plate 10 is movable for advancing the material dumped on the trough shaped bottom to the collecting body, this packer plate 10 being connected with drive means provided with hydraulic cylinder piston systems 13 and 14 by means of portions 12 or journals extending through grooves 11 into the sidewalls 2. According to the invention, the tailgate loader is shaped in such a manner.that on each side thereof the packer plate 10 with the portion 12 or journal extending through the groove 11 is supported on a serially pivotally connected rod system as indicated with a dotted line, one rod of which is a first rocker arm 15 supported on the sidewall, on which rocker arm the loader plate is supported pivotally, which loader plate 10 is connected pivotally with a rocker rod 16 at a distance from its pivotal support 12, this rocker rod forming part of the rod system, which rocker rod 16 is again connected pivotally with a second rocker arm 17 which is also part of the rod system, and that each rocker arm 15, 17 cooperates with a hydraulic cylinder piston system 13 resp. 14 belonging thereto.At least one of the two rocker arms 15, 17 on one side of the installation is connected with an equivalent rocker arm 15 resp. 17 on the other side of the tailgdte loader by means of a rotatably supported soft 18 running between the sidewalls which is shaped as a hollow tube in this embodiment. This shaft 18 is the main shaft of the tailgate loader and preferably the rocker arm 15 is connected firmly with this main shaft 18.Excitation of the hydraulic cylinder piston systems 13 on both sides of the tailgate loader will, therefore, cause here the rocker arms 15 to be rotated simultaneously without there being mutual displacement between the two rocker arms 15.As already stated above, the packer plate 10 is pivotally connected with the first rocker arm 15 with a journal 12 extending in the sidewall 2 through the groove 11, the journal 12 being provided with a fixed arm 19 which is part of the rod system and pivotally connected at 20 with the rocker rod 16.In the embodiment illustrated, the rocker arm 17 is rotatable around the main shaft 18 and, therefore, the pivot points of the two rocker arms 15 resp. 17 coincide in that the rocker arm 17 is supported rotatably around the shaft 18 of the other rocker arm 15. In this embodiment the serially pivotally connected rod system forms a rod quadrangle. It is, however, also possible that the pivot points of the two rocker arms 1 and 17 are positioned at a distance.By means of the cylinder piston system 14 the rocker arm 17 can be displaced, as a result of which also the rocker rod 16 which is pivotally connected therewith is displaced. Because at 20 the rocker rod 16 is connected pivotally with the crank 19, the packer plate 10 will rotate with its journal 12, because the hollow crossbeam 22 of the plate is connected firmly with the journal 12 by means of cheeks 23. At certain distance from each other tooth shaped portions 24 are arranged to the hollow crossbeam 22, these tooth shaped portions forming together a comb shaped portion. The position of the tooth shaped portions 24 or teeth are chosen in such a manner that these may project between the teeth 9 .of the fixed plate 7. With reference to the point 25 of the teeth 24, the track to be passed through by the packer plate 10 will now be described.In Fig. 1 the plate 10 is shown at the end of its compression stroke in which the material is advanced from the trough shaped bottom to the collecting body through the passage under the teeth 9. The teeth 9 then project between the teeth 24. The cylinder piston system 13 is in an extended position and the journal is positioned in the lower portion of the groove 11 in the sidewall 2. The cylinder piston system is now in its most retracted position. Starting fromFig. 1, retraction of the cylinder piston system 13 will cause point 25 of the teeth 24 of the packer plate to pass a track, as indicated with dot and dash line A. Retraction of the cylinder piston system 13 moves the rocker arm 15 upwardly and the journal 12 arrives in the upper portion of the groove 11. The teeth 24 now slip along the teeth 9 and refuse, if any, sticked between the teeth 24 is removed between these teeth.Should there be portions of plastic bags between the teeth,these portions are torn up because the portion of these bags sticking under the teeth holds it fast. After passg the packer plate 10 arrives in a position shown in Fig. 2. Material may be dumped on the trough shaped bottom 1 or into the tailgate loader and it is evident from Fig. 2 that the plate 10 does not mean an impediment when, for instance, refuse is dumped from high tall containers into the tailgate loader. Then the hydraulic cylinder piston system 14 is excited, the cylinder piston system 13 remaining in retracted position.Extension of the cylinder piston system 14 will cause the rocker arm 17 to rotate around the shaft 18, the rocker rod 16 and the fixed arm 19 being pressed backward, so that the plate 10 pivots around its journals 12 and the points 25 of the teeth 24 pass through the track shown in Fig. 3 with B. It is also evident from this figure that the plate can move relatively high above the material dumped on the bottom 1. After the position according to, Fig. 3 has been reached, the cylinderpiston system 13 is now excited, the cylinder piston system 14 remaining in its extended position. In this manner, the rocker arm 15 together with the journal 12 moves downwardly till the journal 12 arrives at the lower portion of the groove 11. The point 25 of the teeth 24 traverses the track C. In order to make the plate 10 traverse its compression stroke, the cylinder piston 14 is retracted, while the cylinder piston system 13 remains in its extended position. The plate 10 now moves towards the aperture under the teeth 9 and finally finishes its compression stroke in the position according to Fig. 1, the point 25 traversing the track D. The material dumped on the bottom is advanced to the collecting body in this manner.The above mentioned movement cycle may be carried out nether discontinuously or continuously. Continuous rotation of the installation is particularly to advantage when loose bags refuse are dumped into the tailgate loader or household containers for refuse are to be emptied.
