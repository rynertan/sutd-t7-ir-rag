# L ASCORBIC ACID PRODUCTION IN MICROORGANISMS

## Abstract
Improved production of ascorbic acid is obtained em ploying Chlorella as a microorganism source and growing the culture under a controlled pattern of carbon source supply. Greatly improved ratios of ascorbic acid to total carbon supplied as well as enhanced ascorbic acid concen trations in the fermentor are obtained. C. pyrenoidosa UV101 158 was deposited at the A.T.C.C. on 27 June 1985 and given Accession no. 53170.
