Preferred groups represented by R are optionally substituted lower alkyl, C2 C6alkylene, monocyclic aryl and monocyclicarylene. According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of the compounds having the formula I2C CI CH2 n0jm R wherein R, m and n have the meanings stated above, which comprises reacting a triiodoalkenol having the formula I C CI CH OH 2 2n with an isocyanate of the formula R NCO m The triiodoalkenols having the above formula in which nis 1, 2 or 3 are known compounds. Triiodoallyl alcohol and 1,1,2 triiodobut l ene 4 ol are mentioned in Volume 1 of Beilsteins Handbuch der Organischen Chemie at pages 440 and 442 respectively. l,l,2 Triiodopent l ene 5 ol is disclosed in Chemical Abstracts, Volume 26, page 2166 1932 . This process can be carried out by methods which are well known in the urethane art. Thus, the isocyanate may be added to the triiodoalkenol at a rate such that the reaction temperature is readily controllable, if desired with the aid of external cooling. The reaction may be carried out in the absence of a solvent, or a solvent which is inert to isocyanate groups may be used.Examples of suitable solvents are esters such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate and 2 ethoxyethyl acetate, ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclohexanone and 4 methoxy 4 methylpentan 2 on e, hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene, halogenated hydrocarbons such as trichloroethylene, methylene dichloride, l,l,l trichloroethane and tetrachloroethylene, and polar aprotic solvents such as dimethyl formamide and dimethylacetamide. There may also be used a catalyst of the kind which accelerates reaction between an isocyanate group and a hydroxyl group. As examples of such catalysts there may be mentioned organic and inorganic basic compounds, and soluble compounds of metals, for example, of transition metals1 such as iron and manganese acetylacetonate, and of tin or antimony, for example, dibutyl tin dilaurate and stannous octoate compounds of lead such as lead acetate, basic lead acetate and lead 2 ethylhexoate. As basic organic catalysts tertiary amines are suitable1 particularly triethylamine, 4 dimethylaminopyridine, triethylenediamine, dimethylbenzylamine and dimethylcycl ohexylamine. Particularly advantageous are mixtures of metallic and amine catalysts.The amount of catalyst used will depend upon its activity, the temperature used and the rate of reaction desired, but in general an amount from 0.02 to 1.0 by weight1 based on the weight of triiodoalkenol, will be appropriate. The reaction may be carried out at normal room temperature, e.g. 15 to 250 C, or at a moderately elevated temperature up to 400C, the temperature preferably being finally raised to 50 600C or somewhat higher, e.g. up to 100 C, to ensure completion of the reaction.The resulting triiodoalkenylcarbamate may be isolated from the reaction mixture by conventional means. According to a yet further feature of the invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of the compounds having the formula I2C CI CH2 nOCO2NH mR wherein R, in and n have the meanings stated above, which comprises iodinating an alkynylcarbamate having the formula HC C CH2 nOCONH m R wherein R, in and n have the meanings stated above. The reaction may be carried out by the addition of iodine to the copper derivative of the alkynylcarbamate, the iodine conveniently being added in the form of a solution in aqueous potassium iodide. The copper derivative of the alkynylcarbamate may be prepared, for example, by addition of the latter to a solution of cuprous chloride in aqueous ammonium carbonate at ambient temperature, when the copper derivative separates and is isolated as a moist cake which is used as such in the iodination stage. The alkynylcarbamates having the above defined formula may themselves be obtained by reaction of the appropriate alkynol having the formula HC C CH2 OH with an isocyarste having the formula R NCO m, R, in and n having the meanings stated above, the reaction being carried out under similar conditions to those described previously for the reaction of a triiodoalkenol I C CI CH OH with an 2 2n isocyar.ate R NCO m. The alkynols of the above formula in which n is 1, 2 or 3 are known compounds. Propargyl alcohol and but l yn 4 ol are mentioned in Volume 1 of Beilsteints Handbuch der Organischen Chemie at pages 454 and 455 respectively. Pent l yn 5 ol is disclosed in Chemical Abstracts, Volume 26, page 2166 1932 . According to a still further feature of the invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of the compounds having the formula I2C CI CH2 nOCONH mR wherein R, m and n have the meanings stated above which comprises iodin at ion of compounds having the formula Ic C CH2 nOCONA m R wherein R, in and n have the meanings defined above.Monoiodoalkynyl esters of N substituted hydrocarbyl carbamic acids having above formula in which the hydrocarbyl group R is an alkyl, aryl or alkylaryl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms are described in US Patent Specification No, 3923870 already referred to, together with one method for their preparation, namely iodination of an alkynol of formula HCDC. CH2 n OH to give IC C CH2 nOH, followed by reaction of the latter with an isocyanate having the formula R NCO m. These monoiodo alkynyl esters of N substituted hydrocarbyl carbamic acids may also be prepared by reacting an alkynol having the formula liC C CH OH with an isocyanate having the formula R NCO to give a carbamate having the formula HC C CH2 nOCONHjmR1 m followed by iodination of the latter. The corresponding nonoiodoalkynyl carbamates in which R is a cycloalkyl or arylalkyl group may be prepared by strictly analogous methods. The conversion of the monoiodoalkynyl derivative into the corresponding triiodoalkenyl compound may be achieved by the copper or ultraviolet radiation catalysed direct addition of molecular iodine to the latter compound, which may be dissolved in a suitable solvent, for example, ethanol. The trio do compound may be isolated from the reaction by conventional means. The new triiodoalkenyl esters of N substituted hydrocarbylcarbamic acids hereinbefore described have biocidal activity, and according to a still further feature of the present invention there is provided a method for protecting a medium which is susceptible to attack by micro organisms against such attack, and controlling or preventing the proliferation of micro organisms in a medium already infected thereby, which comprises adding to the said medium a biocidal amount of a compound having the formula I2C CI CH2 nOCONH mR wherein R, m and n have the meanings stated above. In the above definition, preventing the proliferation of micro organisms means that the micro organisms are not allowed to multiply further, the number of micro organisms not necessarily being substantially altered. Controlling the proliferation of micro organisms means that the rate of multiplication of the micro organisms is either reduced or rendered. negative i.e. a reduction in numbers, including the case of complete eradication . Micro organisms in this specification means bacteria, fungi and algae. The triiodoalkenylcarbamates of the present invention are particularly valuablein respect of their fungicidal activity, and they are especially useful as paint film fungicides. The amount of the biocide which is used will depend upon the medium being treated and the nature of the microorganisms involved, but for aqueous media, for example, the cooling water systems of power stations, the water systems of paper mills, aqueous oil emulsions such as the cutting oils used as lubricants and coolants in the machining of metals and in water based paints and adhesives, an amount from 1 to 1000 parts per million by weight, based on the weight of the medium, may be used, from 25 to 500 parts per million by weight being generally effective. When used as a paint film fungicide the biocide will generally be used in an amount to provide a concentration in the paint, before its application to a substrate, of from 500 to 10,000 parts per million by weight, based on the weight of the paint. The biocidal compound may be added to the appropriate medium as the undiluted solid compound, as a solution in an organic solvent, for example, a lower alkanol such as methanol or ethanol, or dimethylformamide, if desired together with water, or as a dispersion in water prepared with the aid of a dispersing agent, for example, the sodium salt of a naphthalene 2 sulphonic acid, formaldehyde condensate.
