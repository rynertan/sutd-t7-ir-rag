## Abstract
In a method and apparatus for forming a space section 83 in a pair of concealed slide fastener stringers, with a pair of tapes 82, 82 gripped with interengaged coupling elements 80 disposed at the upper side of the tapes 82, 82 , a pair of continuous concealed slide fastener stringers upwardly from the under side of the tapes 82, 82 by a pair of laterally spaced and vertically movable dies 30, 30 until head portions of a series of the interengaged coupling elements 80 are exposed to the dies 30, 30 and supported thereon. A punch 70 is then lowered to cut certain interengaged coupling elements 80 on the raised dies. Finally, an ejector 32 is raised through the dies 30, 30 to clamp the cut coupling elements 80 against the punch 70 and continues moving upwardly to gether with the punch 70 to pull the cut coupling elements 80 out of sewn stitches 85 .
