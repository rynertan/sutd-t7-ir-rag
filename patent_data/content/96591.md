# Drilling bit.

## Abstract
In a diamond impregnated bit scourer particles in the form of silicon carbide are added to the matrix. The mesh size of the silicon carbide is less than that of diamond and the concentration preferably about 40, if the diamond concentration is 40.

## Claims
CLP,IMS 1. An impregnated drilling bit which has a working face, the working face having diamond particles embedded in a matrix and the matrix including particles of a scouring agent selected from the group consisting of alumina, boron carbide and silicon carbide, the scouring agent particles being not larger than the diamond particles. 2. The impregnated drilling bit claimed in claim 1 in which the scouring agent particles are between one quarter and two thirds of the size of the diamond particles. 3. The impregnated drilling crown claimed in either one of the above claims in which the scouring agent is silicon carbide.

## Description
DBILINZ BIDFIELD OF TE ITY xT OIX This invention relates to an impregnated diamond drilling bit for attachment to the end of a drill string. The invention is particularly, but not exclusively, applicable to coring crowns which cut rock cores.BACKGROUND OF THE lIWENnIlON Renown impregnated coring crowns consist of a head which performs the actual drilling in the form of a matrix, prepared by powder metallurgical methods, in which the diamond particles are distributed as homogeneously as possible. In some instances the matrix consists of a bronze. In other cases, the matrix consists of one of, or a mixture of, tungsten, tungsten carbide, nickel and many other metals and refractory carbides infiltrated with a nickel bronze.The matrix depending on its compositlcn may be prepared by either hot pressing or by infiltration.Under the action of the applied forces on the bit resulting from the drilling machine acting on the rotating drill string behind the bit, the pressure that the individual diamond particles exert on small areas of the rock causes the rock to fragment into small particles. As the drilling proceeds the exposed surface of each diamond particle wears, and the matrix in between is also worn away. Should the matrix wear be insufficient, the active particles of diamond will eventually be worn flush with the matrix and new particles will not be exposed at a sufficiently fast rate, drilling will no longer b possible and the bit can be said to have become closed up 1. It is an object of the Invention to provide a matrix which will substantially ameliorate the above problems. SUEtL21 02 TThnff IWvTNTION According to the present invention, there is provided an impregnated drilling bit which has a working face, the working face having diamond particles embedded in a matrix and the matrix including particles of a scouring agent selected from the group consisting of alumina, boron carbide and silicon carbide, the scouring agent particles being not larger than the diamond particles and preferably between one quarter and two thirds of the size of the diamond particles.The scouring agent particles are brittle and hard and have a limited ability to bond to the matrix.When scouring agent particles are released during drilling operations they have the effect of scouring matrix from around the diamond particles and assist in maintaining a gap between the matrix at the face of the bit and the rock such that the bit remains open and can continue to drill efficiently.The scouring agent particles are preferably silicon carbide particles which are between one half and two thirds of the size of the diamond particles. The silicon carbide particles are present in sufficient quantlties that when they tear loose they will scour away matrix from around the diamond particles.Another scouring agent which may be used in the present invention is alumina.In choosing the matrix and the scouring agent, one must firstly ensure that the diamond particles will be firmly held. Secondly the scouring agent particles must break away in time to erode the matrix to keep the bit open, but not so soon as to deprive the working diamond particles of the support of the matrix.DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGIt shows a series of graphs illustrating the performances of various bits.DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTSFour bits were prepared and used in drilling tests to determine their performances. Each bit had the same diamond concentration, viz. 40 concentration and the diamond particles were 35 40 mesh. The bits had the same commercial bronze matrix to which silicon carbide was added as follows Bit No. 1 No addition. Bit No. 2 50 60 mesh SiC added in a concentration of 100, i.e. 25coo by volume.Bit No. 3 50 60 mesh SiC added in a concentration of 40.Bit No. 4 45 50 mesh SiC added in a concentration of 40.In the attached graph the performances of the four bits are illustrated, graph No. 1 showing that ofBit No. 1 and so on.It will be seen that except during the very early stages the load required for drilling to the same depth is much larger for a bit with no SiC than for the other three bits. Also too much scouring agent graph 2 is not to be recommended. 50 60 mesh and 45 50 mesh of the SiC work equally well.
