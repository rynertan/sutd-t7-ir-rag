# Hydraulic drive system for single rod cylinder.

## Abstract
A hydraulic drive system including a main line A , a variable displacement hydraulic pump 1 and another main line B connected to a single rod cylinder 2 in a closed hydraulic circuit, and a flushing valve 9, 10, 14, 19 having a first switching position in which one main line A is communicated with a low pressure line C and a second switching position in which the other main line B is communicated with the low pressure line C . The flushing valve is operative to maintain at least one of the two main lines in communication with the low pressure line C at all times while moving from one switching position to the other switching position, to keep a lock up phenomenon from taking place in the closed hydraulic circuit. The system further includes a pressure generating device 5, 11, 16 for generating between the two main lines A and B a pressure diffe rential necessary for effecting switching of the flushing valve.
