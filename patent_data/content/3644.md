## Description
Title ANIMAL FEED SUPPLEMENTS CONTAINING ANTIBIOTIC TRANS BM123y AND PROCESS FOR MAKING SAME, This invention relates to a method of recovering antibiotic BM123t from fermentation whole harvest mashes containing it. More particularly, the novel process involves adding a synthetic tanning agent, an alkali metal alkyl sulfate or a dioctyl sulfosuccinate either to the whole harvest mash or to the filtered fermentation liquor, and recovering the so precipitated antibiotic complex by any convenient means. The invention also relates to the use of these and related complexes and salts in animal feed supplement compositions for enhancing the growth rate of animals such as poultry, swine, early weaned pigs, and ruminants such as cattle, sheep and goats. Antibiotic trans BMl23rmay be formed by fermentative biosynthesis during the cultivation under controlled conditions of certain strains of an undetermined species of Nocardia, which are available from theAgricultive Research Service Culture Collection,Northern Regional Research Laboratory, Peoria, Illinois,U.S.A. where they are deposited under Nos. NRRL 5646EMI1.1 NRRL 8050 and NRRL 11230. Mutants of such strains mayEMI1.2 EMI1.3 also produce the antibiotic. The preparation and properties of antibiotics trans BM123T1, trans BM123T2, and trans BM123 are set forth in U.S. Patent No.4,007,167. Hereinafter, the term trans BM123y refers to a mixture in any proportions of trans BM123r1 and trans BMI23 gamma 2. The problem of recovering the antibiotic economically has been a serious one. In the patent referred to above, adsorption on carbon followed by elution and column chromatography are employed. Such a process is not excessively expensive where pure antibiotic is required for medical usage. However, when the antibiotic is to be used in animal feed supplement compositions the factor of cost is a very serious matter and there is, therefore, a need for an inexpensive process of recovering the antibiotic for this purpose. The present invention deals with a process and in a more specific aspect also with a product. The process involves the precipitation of the antibiotic either from the whole harvest mash or from the filtered fermentation broth by the addition of a synthetic tanning agent, an alkali metal alkyl sulfate or a dioctyl sulfosuccinate salt. More specifically, in its broadest aspect, the present invention provides a process for the production of an animal feed supplement, characterized by adding to a fermentation whole harvest mash containing containing antibiotic trans BM123t, or to a filtered fermentation broth containing antibiotic By1237, at a suitable acid pH, a complexing agent selected from synthetic tanning agents, alkali metal alkyl sulfates and dioctyl sulfosuccinate salts, whereby to precipitate out a complex of the antibiotic with said complexing agent and recovering the precipitated complex. The synthetic tanning agent operable in the process of the present invention is a sulfited phenol formaldehyde condensate which may be represented by the following general formula EMI3.1 wherein R is hydrogen or a methylene sulfonic acid group CH2S03H and n is 0,1,2,3, or 4 with the proviso that about half of the R groups present are methylene sulfonic acid groups. This synthetic tanning agent is not a pure chemical compound but of necessity is obtained as a mixture having an estimated molecular weight of 420 530. It is readily prepared by first condensing phenol and formaldehyde in aqueous media followed by reaction of the intermediate condensate with formaldehyde, various sulfites, and buffer acids lifmET num yLtNE thus formingt sulfonic acid groups CH2S03H in the molecule.The product is an amorphous water soluble material that may be obtained either in concentrated water solution or in powder form, and ranges from colorless to dark brown. In order to avoid cumbersome language, this synthetic tanning agent will be referred to by its generic name in the art as syntan , and this term will be used extensively in the specification and appended claims. A sulfited phenol formaldehyde syntan of the above general type is sold by A.J. BR J.O. Pilar Inc. of Newark, N.J. under the trademarks of TruTan RT Regular and TruTan RT New. The alkali metal alkyl sulfates alternatively operable as complexing agent the process of the present invention may be represented by the following general formula CH3 CH2 nOSO2OM wherein n is an integer from 9 to 17, inclusive, and M is sodium or potassium. Typical of such alkali metal alkyl sulfates which may be employed are, for example, sodium decyl sulfate, potassium hendecyl sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate, potassium tridecyl sulfate, sodium myristyl sulfate, potassium pentadecyl sulfate, sodium cetyl sulfate, potassium haptadecyl sulfate, and sodium octadecyl sulfate.Mixtures of alkali metal alkyl sulfates may also be employed such as a mixture of sodium cetyl sulfate and sodium oleyl sulfate a mixture of sodium hendecyl sulfate and potassium octadecyl sulfate a mixture of potassium decyl sulfate and sodium heptadecyl sulfate a mixture of potassium lauryl sulfate and potassium cetyl sulfate a mixture of sodium tridecyl sulfate, potassium myristyl sulfate, and sodium pentadecyl sulfate, and the like. When mixtures of alkali metal alkyl sulfates are employed, then a corresponding mixture of antibiotic alkyl sulfate complexes are obtained. The dioctyl sulfosuccinate salts operable in the process of the present invention are those prepared from sulfobutanedioic acid, 1,4 bis 2ethylhexyl ester and the alkali metal or alkaline earth metal cations. Typical of such salts are dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, dioctyl potassium sulfosuccinate, dioctyl calcium sulfosuccinate, dioctyl magnesium sulfosuccinate, etc. The preparation and properties of these dioctyl sulfosuccinate salts are set forth in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,028,091, 2,176,423, and 3,035,973. Mixtures of dioctylsulfosuccinate salts may also be employed such as a mixture of dioctyl lithium sulfosuccinate and dioctyl barium sulfosuccinate. When mixtures of dioctyl sulfosuccinate salts are employed, then a corresponding mixture of antibiotic complexes are obtained. The novel process of the present invention provides almost complete removal of the antibiotic activity from the fermentation mash or broth.Furthermore, the antibiotic complexes so obtained can be used without separation of the constituents in animal feed supplement compositions, which is an important economic advantage. Therefore, in one of the aspects of the present invention the complex of antibiotic trans BM123r and the above described compounds are included as new products. The products of the antibiotic have been referred to as reversible antibiotic complexes. Their exact chemical nature has not been determined, but covalent bonding is not involved and the product is not a physical mixture. The complex, derived from the interaction of the antibiotic and the syntan, alkali metal alkyl sulfate or dioctyl sulfosuccinate salt is not necessarily combined in any limiting stoichiometry. The chemical bonds are reversible since antibiotic trans BMl23ymay be recovered from the complex by adsorption on a cross linked carboxymethyldextran gel column followed by elution with aqueous acid. While it is not intended to limit the present invention to theories of chemical constitution and the like, it seems probable that the complexes of the present invention are sufficiently reversible so that under conditions of use in animal feed supplement compositions the antibiotic is set free upon ingestion. As starting material for the novel processes of the present invention there may be employed the whole harvest mash obtained after completion of a fermentation with the aforementioned Nocardia sp. NRRL 5646, NRRL 8050,NRRL 11230 or mutants thereof. Preferably, there is employed the fermentation liquor or broth which has been clarified by removing the mycelia and other insolubles by filtration. Diatomaceous earth or any other conventional filtration aid may be used to assist in the filtration. In the case of the syntan complex, the following procedure is preferably followed. The pH of the whole mash or the filtered broth may be first adjusted to between 1.8 and 5.0 with dilute aqueous acid. Suitable acids for this purpose may be, for example, dilute hydrochloric acid, dilute sulfuric acid, dilute trifluoroacetic acid, etc., although even glacial acetic acid may be used. Then an aqueous solution of the syntan is added slowly, with stirring, at ambient temperatures. The pH may then be adjusted at this point to 1.8 5.0 by acidifying as above or basifying with a suitable base such as aqueous ammonia or soda ash. The antibiotic and the syntan form a complex which is water insoluble and thus precipitates.The precipitated syntan complex or, in the case of the whole mash, the precipitated syntan complex together with the fermentation mash solids, is then removed by filtration or centrifugation and dried. The products so obtained may be dried by 1 slurrying the wet solids in polar, water miscible non solvents such as acetone followed by filtration, rinsing and airdrying or by 2 reslurrying the wet solids in water and freeze drying or spray drying. When the products of the present invention are thus carefully dried under temperature conditions which do not degrade antibiotic trans BM123 , they are usually white to tan powders in the case of the syntan complex.In the case of the syntan complex associated with dried harvest mash solids, they are usually gray to brown powders or solids. In the dry form, these products are extremely stable, keeping without significant loss of antibiotic activity for considerable periods of time. This long storage life is, of course, an important practical advantage. It is an advantage of the present invention that the amount of syntan added to precipitate the complex is not critical and no exact stoichiometric relations need to be followed. In general, the amount of syntan used will be somewhat in excess of the minimum required to form the complex with the antibiotic. Excess syntan will merely remain in solution upon filtration. The amount of syntan required is, however, directly proportional to the antibiotic concentration in the mash or liquor. The specific bioactivity of the precipitated complex also varies and it is in fact likely that the complex has varying relative amounts of antibiotic and, of course, is quite likely to be a mixture of complexes because the syntan used is not a pure single chemical compound. The minimum amount of syntan required to form the complex with the antibiotic in any particular fermentation batch may be readily determined as follows. A sample conveniently 50 100 mB of the fermentation whole harvest mash is taken and clarified by removing the mycelia and other insolubles by filtration, preferably with a filter aid. The filtrate is then acidified to a pH of 1.805.0 with dilute aqueous mineral acid such as dilute hydrochloric acid, dilute sulfuric acid, dilute phosphoric acid, or the like. The solution is then titrated with the particular aqueous solution of syntan which is to be used until no further precipitate or turbidity forms. The amount of syntan solution for the fermentation batch is then calculated from the titter. of the sample taken, providing also for a slight excess. In the case of the alkyl metal alkyl sulfate, the preferred procedure is that which will now be described. The pH of the whole mash or of the filtered broth is first adjusted to between 1.9 and 2.1, preferably about 2.0, with an acid. Suitable acids for this purpose may be, for example, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, and the like, although even glacial acetic acid may be used.This pH adjustment appears to be critical since below pH 1.9 there appears to be degradation of antibiotic trans BMI23 gamma during drying of the filter cake even at 40 C, under vacuum. Then, an aqueous solution of an alkali metal alkyl sulfate or a mixture of alkali metal alkyl sulfates is added slowly, with stirring, at ambient temperatures. The entire process of the present invention is preferably carried out at from about 15 C. to about 300C., conveniently at room temperature. The antibiotic and alkyl sulfate form a complex which is water insoluble and thus precipitates. The precipitated complex or, in the case of the whole mash, the precipitated complex together with the fermentation mash solids, is then removed by filtration or centrifugation and dried.The products so obtained may be dried by 1 slurrying the wet solids in polar, water miscible non solvents such as acetone followed by filtration, rinsing and air drying or by 2 reslurrying the wet solids in water and freeze drying or spray drying. In the use of the dioctyl sulfosuccinate complex, the preferred procedure is as will now be described. The pH of the whole harvest mash or the filtered broth is first adjusted to between 2.5 and 6.0 with dilute aqueous acid. Suitable acids for this purpose may be, for example, dilute hydrochloric acid, dilute sulfuric acid, dilute trifluoroacetic acid, etc., although even glacial acetic acid may be used. Then an aqueous solution of a dioctyl sulfosuccinate salt or a mixture thereof is added slowly, with stirring, at ambient temperature. Diatomaceous earth is added and the antibiotic and the dioctyl sulfosuccinate salt form a complex which is water insoluble and thus precipitates. The precipitated complex or, in the case of the whole mash, the precipitated complex together with the fermentation mash solids, is recovered by filtration or centrifugation and dried.The products so obtained may be dried by slurrying the wet solids in polar, water miscible liquids such as acetone which do not act as solvents for the complex followed by filtration, rinsing and air drying or by reslurrying the wet solids in water and freeze drying or spray drying. When the products of the present invention are thus carefully dried under temperature conditions which do not degrade antibiotic trans BMl23T, they are usually tan to brown colored solids. The amount of dioctyl sulfosuccinate salt added to precipitate the complex with the antibiotic is normally the minimum required to form the complex with the antibiotic. The amount of dioctyl sulfos uccihate salt required is, however, directly proportional to the antibiotic concentration in the mash or liquor.The specific bioactivity of the precipitated complex also varies and it is, in fact, likely that the complex has varying relative amounts of antibiotic. The minimum amount of dioctyl sulfosuccinate salt required to form the complex with the antibiotic in any particular fermentation batch may be readily determined as follows. A sample conveniently 50 100ml. of the fermentation whole harvest mash is taken and clarified by removing the mycelia and other insolubles by filtration, preferably with a filter aid. The filtrate is then acidified to a pH of 2.5 to 4.8 with dilute aqueous mineral acid. This solution is then titrated with the particular aqueous solution of dioctyl sulfosuccinate salt which is to be used until no further precipitate or turbidity forms. The amount of dioctyl sulfosuccinate salt solution for the fermentation batch is then calculated from the titer of the sample taken. The trans BM123 complexes which can be produced by the process of the present invention can be used as growth promoting agents for farm animals. We have also found that antibiotic trans BM 123r itself, salts thereof, and alkylated derivatives thereof, are similarly useful as growth promoting agents for animals. Thus, in another aspect, the present invention provides an animal feed supplement characterized as a dried mixture of fermentation harvest mash solids and an anti bacterial ingredient selected from the group consisting of antibiotic trans BM123y, an antibiotic trans BM123t salt, an antibiotic trans BM123yalkyl sulfate complex, an antibiotic trans BMl23ydioctyl sulfossuccinate complex, an antibiotic trans BM123y syntan complex, an antibiotic trans BMl23yalkylated derivative, and mixtures thereof in any proportion. The invention also provides an animal feed composition for improving feed efficiency and enhancing the growth rate of animals and poultry characterized as a nutritionally balanced animal feed containing from about 0.001 to about 1.0 by weight of the feed of an antibacterial ingredient selected from the group consisting of antibiotic trans BM123 an antibiotic trans BM123tsalt, an antibiotic trans BM123r alkyl sulfate complex, an antibiotic trans BM123 dioctyl sulfosuccinate complex, an antibiotic trans BM123 syntan complex, an antibiotic trans BM123 alkylated derivative, and mixtures thereof in any proportion. The alkylated derivatives of trans BM123 which are effective as growth promoting agents herein are described in U.S. Patent 4,048,431. In accordance with the present invention, the dried complexes or the dried harvest mash solids containing the complexes, either along or in combination with suitable carriers, when added to an animal feed aid in increasing the growth rate. In addition, feed efficiency is improved. The present invention has the advantage that the growth rate of non ruminants such as poultry and swine and especially weanling pigs is significantly increased, and that feed conversion rates are noticeably enhanced. The feed supplement compositions of the present invention suitably are administered in an amount sufficient to furnish approximately the following dosage levels in mg. head day Large ruminants 350 Small ruminants 200 Non ruminants 100 Poultry 2The milligrams per pound of antibiotic trans BM1237 present in any particular supplement composition of the present invention may be readily determined by bioassay as set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4,007,167. The preferred method is an adaptation of the Staphylococcus aureus turbidimetric assay for tetracycline that is described in the manual Assay Methods of Antibiotics, aLaboratory Manual by D.C. Grove and W.A. Randall,Medical Encyclopedia Inc. 1955 pages 48 52, substituting Klebsiella pneumoniae as the test organism.From the potency data thus obtained, the pounds of feed supplement composition to be used per ton of feed may be readily calculated. A wide variety of carriers may be used in the preparation of the feed supplement compositions of this invention. Carriers suitable for use to make up the feed supplement compositions include the following soybean meal, alfalfa meal, cotton seed oil meal, linseed oil meal, cornmeal, cane molasses, urea, bone meal, corncob meal, and the like. The carrier promotes a uniform distribution of the complex in the finished feed into which the supplement is blended.It thus performs an important function by ensuring proper distribution of the complex throughout the feed. The following examples illustrate the invention. Example 1 Preparation of Antibiotic trans BM123T Syntan Complex from Whole Harvest Mash Thirty liters of Nocardia sp.
