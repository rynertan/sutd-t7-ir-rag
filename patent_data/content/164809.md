# Method of protecting or shielding a device from oxygen within a glass melting furnace.

## Abstract
A method is disclosed for protecting or shielding a device such as an electrode 130, 130 , 130 within a glass melting furnace 110 , the device 130, 130 , 130 being maintained at elevated temperatures above an oxidizing temperature thereof. The device 130, 130 , 130 is dipped into the molten glass 112 to a selected immersion level D2 along a selected length thereof susceptible to temperatures in excess of the oxidation temperature, and maintained at the immersion level D2 for a sufficient time to allow the molten glass to adhere to and coat the device over said selected length. The device with its adhered molten glass coating 140 is with drawn from the molten glass at least to a selected operating level D1 above the immersion level D2 such that the device is shielded from oxidizing agents along the selected length.
