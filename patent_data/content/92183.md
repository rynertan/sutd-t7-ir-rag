# Preservation of foods with non lactose fermenting Streptococcus lactis subspecies Diacetilactis.

## Abstract
A method for using selected strains of Streptococcus lac tis subspecies diacetilactis, which have been modified to be non lactose fermenting, for the preservation of foods contai ning lactose is described. The subspecies is more generally known as Streptococcus diacetilactis. The selected Strepto coccus diacetilactis strains have been modified by curing to remove at least one natural plasmid which controls the fermen tation of lactose to lactic acid while retaining the ability of this subspecies to inhibit bacterial spoilage in foods. The plasmid removed by curing is about 41 megadaltons Mdal in mass. The method using the modified strains of Streptococcus dia cetilactis is particularly adapted for the preservation of milk products.
