# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE MOLDING OF GLASS REINFORCED PLASTIC BODIES

## Abstract
In a method of molding a large plastic structure which includes applying a vacuum to draw the molds together, injecting resin into the space between the molds while the vacuum is applied, maintaining the vacuum at least until the resin gels, removing the vacuum, allowing the molded structure to harden, removing the male mold and then removing the molded structure, molding is carried out on a moving production line without danger of disturbing the resin while gelling by disposing the molds on bogies and moving the bogies onto motor driven glide rollers at the point where the resin is injected, and the bogies transported on the glide roller drive until initial gelling has taken place. In order to maintain a vacuum at a plurality of molds on an assembly line, each mold has its own vacuum unit operating with compressed air and a pluraiity of molds are interconnected to supply compressed air in series to each of the molds.
