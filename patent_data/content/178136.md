# PRESSURE VESSEL

## Abstract
A portable pressure valve in the form of a welded steel tank having four upright substantially planar side walls 1 to 4 welded together at adjacent edges to form an assembly that is rectangular in horizontal cross section. Top and bottom walls 5,7 are welded to the side walls, a relief valve 11 is mounted on the top wall and a discharge valve 25 is mounted on the bottom wall. A steel frame comprises an upright 26 to 29 at each of the four junctions between adjacent side wall edges and a reinforcing structure eg. 36, 41, 47, 48, 49 for each side wall is welded to and extends between each pair of up rights and is also welded to the respective side wall, in order to give to the wall the strength necessary to withstand the ex pected pressures. Reinforcing structures are associated with the top and bottom walls for the same purpose. Base members are welded at the feet of the uprights and provide a horizontal base plane for the assembly.
