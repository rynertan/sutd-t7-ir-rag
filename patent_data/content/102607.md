# Disc playback apparatus.

## Abstract
In a disc playback apparatus using an optical pickup 14 or the like, any flaws on a track of the disc 13 are detected using a first level detector 16 for detecting a maximum value level of a recording information signal of an output of the pickup 14 a second level detector 17 for detecting a change of the maximum value level of the recording information signal and a comparator 18 for comparing outputs e₀₁, e₀₂ of the above first and second level detectors 16, 17 . When any flaws were detected, a driving signal of a driving device for the pickup is held to a fixed potential.
