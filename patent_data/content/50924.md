# Pawl and ratchet mechanism.

## Abstract
A pawl and ratchet mechanism having a movable baulking member 4a , saltable in both a ratcheting and a pawl free condition in which the pawl and ratchet components are respectively in and out of engagement with each other, and also settable in a baulking condition which prevents relative movement of the said components into the ratcheting condition, the baulking member 4a being maintained in the baulking condition when the relative rotation of the said components is inappropriate to permit the mechanism to be operated in the ratcheting condition, and a thrust member 24, 92 engageable with the baulking member 4a or with means 4 connected thereto and movable in first and second directions to move the baulking member 4a towards or away from the ratcheting condition. Thrust switching means 34, 61 is provided, settable in first and second conditions in which, in operation, thrust is imparted to the thrust member 24, 92 to cause them to move respectively in the said first and second directions, and detector means 40 46, 81 84, 90 which detects when the baulking member 4a has moved into the baulking condition and when the baulking member 4a has moved out of the baulking condition and into the pawl free condition, the detector means 40 46, 81 84, 90 controlling the setting of the thrust switching means 34, 61 .
