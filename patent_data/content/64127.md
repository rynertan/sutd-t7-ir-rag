# ELECTRONIC THERMOMETER WITH INTEGRALLY HOUSED PROBE AND COIL CORD

## Abstract
An electronic clinical thermometer with electrical circuit ry 13,37 and a display 2,22 to indicate the temperature as measured by a probe 5,25 , which is sheathed in the housing 1,20 containing the electrical circuitry and display. The probe leads are connected to the circuit in the housing by a coiled cord 6,26 which will stretch from a passage 16,32 in the housing when the probe is unsheathed. The probe handle nests 10,30 with the housing and covers the openings leading to the probe sheath 18,34 and the passage into which the cord retracts, so that the probe is protected and the cord hidden when the thermometer is not in use.
