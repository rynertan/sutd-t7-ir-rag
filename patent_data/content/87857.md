# Multiport register file.

## Abstract
A monolithic storage array 10 having multiple write ports 12, 14 and multiple read ports 16, 18 , which may be used simultaneously in any combination. Each cell of the illustrative array has two storage flip flops Q1 Q4 and Q5 Q8 , one for connection to each read port, and has a switching network Q9 Q16 for connecting write port row and column selection signals to set or reset both flip flops as desired. Row selection for reading is effected by raising a power supply voltage coupled to the flip flops, to increase noise immunity, and the device has only four isolated collectors, for high device density in monolithic form.
