## Description
The preSent invention relates to a vehicle wiring system. Conventionally, a wiring system in a motor vehicle such as a car consists of a wiring harness connecting the various components such as the lights, windscreen wipers etc., via the control switches on the dashboard to the vehicle battery. The harness is itself necessarily complicated involving a large number of wires of different lengths which need to be colour coded for identification and which are provided with different types of terminals. The production of a wiring harness therefore entails a large amount of labour and furthermore a purpose built harness is required for each vehicle model and indeed the wiring harnesses differ between versions of the same model. Consequently, the vehicle manufacturer requires large stocks of harnesses to meet all his needs.A still further disadvantage is the labour involved in installing a wiring harness and to an even greater extent its replacement in a used vehicle if it should become damaged. The present invention therefore seeks to provide a simplified wiring system which is capable of mitigating at least some of the foregoing disadvantages. In accordance with the present invention, there a vehicle wiring system comprises a power supply cable extending from a live terminal of the vehicle battery to the vicinity of each electrical component to be energised, a master computing unit connected to switches on the dashboard, slave units arranged in the vicinity of the components to be energised and connected by a signal line to the master computing unit, and switch means controlled by the slave units in dependence upon instructions received by way of the signal line from the master unit, the slave units being further operative to send to the master unit a signal indicative of correct or incorrect operation of the components, Preferably, the master unit is further connected to a display controlled by the master unit to provide a visible indication identifying any faulty component. Advantageously, the master unit is additionally arranged to provide a visual indication on the dashboard of the various operating parameters of the vehicle such as oil pressure, water temperature, alternator voltage and contents of the fuel tank, the slave units being connected to sensors and being arranged to transmit such information to the master processing unit over the said signal line. The invention will now be described further, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a block diagram of a wiring system in accordance with the present invention Figure 2 is a detailed diagram of the hardware conatined in the master computing unit, and Figure 3 shows the hardware of each of the slave units. The system in Figure 1 consists of a master computing unit 10 connected to five slave units designated 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20. The slave unit 12 is connected to the live terminal of the vehicle battery 22 by means of a starter cable 24 and a thinner gauge power cable 26 connects the live terminal of the battery in turn to the slave units 14, 16 18 and 20 and additionally to the master unit 10, a three way plug and socket 30 being provided at the branch leading to the master unit 10. Additionally, a signal line 32 is passed around the car connecting the master unit 10 to all the slave processing units and if required an earthline 34 is additionally provided. An earthline is required where there is no return path through the vehicle body, for example where the body of the vehicle is of fibreglass. Bach of the slave units has a plurality of switches which may be relays but are preferably electronic switches such as power transistors.Bach slave unit is connected by a set of short wires to a few adjacent components. The master unit controls the operation of the slave units and also supports the driver interface two displays and up to tw enty two switches The slave units are each capable of controlling and monitoring eight switching channels, each unit can also monitor eight analogue channels as described further below. By mounting the master unit in proximity to the user of the vehicle dashboard it is possible for the majority of data inputs controlling system functions to be fed directly into the master unit.However certain data, e.g. oil pressure, is collected remotely. System functions can be divided into three categories. The first category consists of functions controlled directly from the master unit e.g. Sidelights, Readlights, Indicators, Fans,Horns, Starter motor, Ignition coil feed, Stop lights, Reversing lights, and other dashboard controlled functions. Although the stop and,reversing lights are included in this category it may in some harness configurations be desirable to sense those switches remotely. The second category may be termed remote functions and includes oil pressure sense, fuel level sense, temperature sense, and alternator output sense. Finally, some functions require special consideration and form a special category. For example, because of the nature of the electronic system it is not possible to use the snventional parking circuit for the windscreen wiper. Instead, it is necessary to sense the parking switch and use this information in conjunction with steering column switches to control the motor. The master computing unit of a practical embodiment is based upon an Intel minimum CS85 chip set. This comprises three devices 8085A CPU , 8156 RAM and I O , 8755A EPROH and I O connected in the manner shown in the circuit of Figure 2. The system is augmented by an 8212 eight hit latch which provides an additional eight output lines for driving indicator light emitting diodes. The master unit is constructed on a singlePCB placed behind the dashboard. Connectors for swish inputs, display serial I O and power are brought out to the edge of the board. Ribbon cable is used for all connections to the board. The twenty two I O lines of the 8156 RAM are used for reading switch inputs from the dashboard, steering column and other switches. These lines are active low, i.e. a switch closure causes the appropriate line to be tied to ground. This provides for fail safe operation in that in the event of any fault in the computing system power is maintained to the various components. The master unit controls two displays, the first being a two digit decimal display driven from the 8755A central processing unit via two 7447 TTb.BCI to 7 segment decoders. This, display operates in two modes 1. Display of driver requested information from analogue sensors, e.g. temperature.2. Display of system faults blinking mode . Mode 1 display information is selected actuation of switches connected to the 8755A PR0N. Mode 2 is a default mode and is entered automatically on occurence of a system fault identified by the flashing number.The second display consists of eight individual IIM f s used for warning lights. They are driven by the 8212 output latch. Communication to the slave units utilises the bit programmable I 0 lines of 8755g. The serial I O line PA7PA,6 interfaces with the data bus of the wiring harness through two 74125 TTL tri state buffers arranged back to back forming a single bi directional buffer. Another I O line PA5 controls the buffer mode. The CPU clock is driven by an external 6MHz crystal. This provides an accurate time base for serial communication. In addition, the clock output CM of the CPU feeds the timer of the RAM which is used for deriving real time functions.The timer is programmed to run continuously and interrupts the CPU at a software controllable time interval via the interrupt input. Power to the microcomputer is supplied by a 7805 5V voltage regulator. An in line diode protects the regulator against inversion of the 12V supply. Drop at this supply occurs when the bu s line voltage falls below approximately,6.5V. Each slave unit Fig. 3 is bas ed upbn the Intel 8748 single chip microcomputer. This device is a member of the MCS48 family, it is a W EPROM version of the 8048. The slave units are constructed on two PCB1s. One board carries the microcomputer and data acquisition circuits, the other power transistor, drivers and resistor networks for monitoring of the outputs. The boards are mounted in a diecast box with all connections bDugh to a single nylon multiway socket. Like the master unit, the slaves have an external 6 MHz crystal as a frequency reference.This permits accurate matching of the bit rates between master and slave. Address of the slave unit is read in from three switches. Thb three switches allow the master to control up to eight slave units. Since the stand alone 8748 does not have enough I O lines to meet the full requirements of the slave unit, it is used in conj mtion with an Intel 8243 I O expander chip. This interfaces directly to the 8748 at the expense of 4 I O lines, prqviding an additional sixteen programmableI O lines. Each switching channel of the slave has two of these lines dedicated to it, one output P4o 53 for controlling the power switches and one input P60 P73 for monitoring the load. Analogue data acquisition is from a Teledyne 8700 eight bit CMOS analogue to d gital converter.Under microcomputer control it is possible to select one of eight analogue inputs via a CMOS 4051 multiplexer. Channel selection is determined by 3 I O lines P24 P26 . A D conversion is initiated by a 0 1 0 transition on a converter line and completed conversion is signalled by a status line going low. . Data is read into the microcomputer through an eight bit port. The serial 1 0 line interfaces with the data bus of the wir ing harness through a buffer similar to that of the master buffer. TwoI O lines control the buffer mode. The serial line also connects to the interrupt input of the 8748. This signals arrivial of data when the buffer in the input mode and the internal interrupt logic of the 8748 is enabled Power switching in the save units is performed by PNP Darlington power transistors. The devices used Lamda PMD 13K40 have an 8A continuous rating and a minimum current gain of eight hundred. Drive from the microcomputer is stepped up by open collector drivers on the switching board. Resistor networks monitor the O P circuits of the power transistors when in the off state. If a normal bad is present, the output of the network is a logic 0 otherwise the output is a logic i ,. This would occur in the event of a lamp filament failing open circuit . A short ciruit output would blow the output line fuse and the O P will appearO C indicating a fault condition. The output is also monitored when theTwitching channel is in the on state. This is achieved by turning the power transistor off for a short time. When saturated it takes approximately 25 ps for the device to tarn off. After this time, valid data can be read by the 8748 and the channel returned to active status. The short off time does not permit lamp filaments to cool thus minimising stress on the lamp. The microcomputer board is powered by a similar regulator arrangement to the, master In addition, a 5V rail is provided for the ADG. This is generated from the 5Y rail by an Intersil 7600 CMOS voltage converter. Power to the switching board is taken directly from the unregulated 12T supply. Communication between master and slaves is always initiated by the master transmitting a command.Command words consist of ten bits, one start bit low , eight data bits and one stop bit high . Each bit is 20 Fs wide, i.e. the transmission rate is 50K bits When not in use, the default state of the data bus is high. The eight data bits consist of an analogue channel request, three slave address bits, th ee slave channel address bits and one bit for selecting channel state for switching command O on . This format allows control of eight slave units each with eight switching and eight analogue channels. The system may be expanded to control mae slave units by licreasing the number of address bits, e.gb an additional bit doubles the possible number of slave units. Following a command, the addressed slave replies with a word also containing eight bits. If the command was an analogue data request, the result of the last conversion is returned. If switching,If switching, the load monitoring data is returned, i.e. start bit followed by either eight zeros or eight ones 0 normal .Commands are transmitted cyclicly, i.e. the complete set of commands is transmitted the sequence is then repeated. In use, the master unit collects all data relevant to the system operation from either the slave units or directly from switches on the dashboard.Raving accepted information from the data inputs, the master transmits appropriate commands to each componentrof the system e.g. if the brake light switch is on, it transmits commands to the slave units which will turn on the power to the bulbs. The master cycles around all components of the system during a control cycle. Once completed, the cycle is repeated, because this method of repeated transmission eliminates spurious commands that may occur due to electrical noise. Following transmission of each command there is a time slot during which the slave addressed can return data relating to the command to the master. For example, if the command is to switch on a lamp that is broken, the slave unit informs the master which makes this information available to the driver of the vehicle. An additional feature of the master is its potential to communicate with processors controlling other subsystems of the vehicle. It might, for example, pass information from the. fuel tank and the rod speed sensors to a trip computer.
