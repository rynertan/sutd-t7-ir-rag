# Closed vaporization heat transfer system.

## Abstract
Closed heat transfer system including a body of water in a first chamber 12 , a body of aluminum compound in a second chamber 14 and a conduit 16 connecting the containers, the system being operative in a first step to evaporate water from the first chamber 12 to cool it by withdrawing heat of vaporization which is supplied to the water at relatively low temperature and to react the water vapor with the aluminum compound in the second chamber 14 to generate heat at relatively high temperature and to combine with the water so that the water vapor pressure remains low and water con tinues to evaporate from the body of water 10 for cintinued cooling, and the system operating in a second stage by supply of heat to the reaction products of the water and aluminum compound to restore the aluminum compound to its initial condition by driving off water which is condensed and returned to the body of water 10 in the first chamber 12 .
