## Description
The present invention relates to polypeptides which are useful as diuretics, natriuretics and vasodilators, methods to produce said polypeptides, compositions of DNA encoding said polypeptides, as well as recombinant expression systems capable of expressing said DNA and recombinant hosts transformed with said expression system. In the prior art the search continues for a natriuretic hormone which might modulate tubular reabsorption. There are several candidates for such a hormone, among which are included the natriuretic factor s recently isolated from atrial muscle cells. A natriuretic effect has been demonstrated by crude extracts of rat atrial tissue but not ventricular tissue. The existence of these atrial natriuretic factors strengthens the long held suspicion that the heart, aside from its obvious influence on renal perfusion, may play an important role in regulating renal sodium and water excretion. Stretching of the atria is known to induce diuresis and natriuresis, and this is possibly mediated by increased release of these factors. Diuretic therapy is currently a mainstay in the treatment of hypertension, renal failure and the various edematous states heart failure, etc. . Currently available pharmacological preparations have, however, several important limitations and undesirable effects. While their use may be directed at a specific abnormality i.e. volume expansion , their multiple actions are undoubtedly not physiological, leading for instance to potassium depletion, increased retention of uric acid and abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism. In addition, all known diuretics profoundly stimulate the renin angiotensin aldosterone system, which counteracts their volume depleting and blood pressure lowering effects and leads to other unwanted effects. It would be desirable to provide a pharmacologically effective compound which can regulate blood pressure by providing a complete but controlled range of physiological responses. However, the isolation of such compounds from atrial tissue is typically a cumbersome process and requires substantial substrate tissue to produce minute quantities of the compounds. While certain of these compounds can be produced by chemical synthesis, it was considered desirable to apply recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid DNA and related technologies to the production of larger quantities of such compounds to provide material for clinical and therapeutic applications. Proceeding from the seminal work of Cohen Boyer, U.S. Patent No. 4,237,224, recombinant DNA technology has become useful to provide novel DNA sequences and produce large amounts of heterologous proteins in transformed cell cultures. In general, the joining of DNA from different organisms relies on the excision of DNA sequences using restriction endonucleases. These enzymes are used to cut donor DNA at very specific locations, resulting in gene fragments which contain the DNA sequences of interest. These DNA fragments usually contain short single stranded tails at each end, termed sticky ends . These sticky ended fragments can then be ligated to complementary fragments in expression vehicles which have been prepared, e.g., by digestion with the same restriction endonucleases. Having created an expression vector which contains the structural gene of interest in proper orientation with the control elements, one can use this vector to transform host cells and express the desired gene product with the cellular machinery available. Once expressed, the gene product is generally recovered by lysing the cell culture, if the product is expressed intracellularly, or recovering the product from the medium if it is secreted by the host cell. Recombinant DNA technology has been used to express entirely heterologous gene products, termed direct expression, or the gene product of interest can be expressed as a fusion protein containing some parts of the amino acid sequence of a homologous protein. This fusion protein is generally processed post translationally to recover the native gene product. Many of the techniques useful in this technology can be found in Maniatis, T., However, while the general methods are easy to summarize, the construction of an expression vector containing a desired structural gene is a difficult process and the successful expression of the desired gene product in significant amounts while retaining its biological activity is not readily predictable. Frequently gene products are not biologically active when expressed in yeast, bacteria or mammalian cell systems. In these cases, post translational processing is required to produce biological activity. The present invention provides a polypeptide compound useful as a natriuretic, diuretic, and or vasodilator in mammals, said polypeptide compound having the formula wherein Further embodiments of the invention are set forth in the attached claims 2 to 9. Compounds of the present invention useful as natriuretics, diuretics, vasodilators and modulators of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system include atrial natriuretic vasodilator polypeptides ANVPs substantially free of unrelated atrial tissue or products. Also included are polypeptide compounds identified by the formula where n 19, and including any of the D isomer, L isomer and DL isomer racemic mixture and Also provided are methods for producing compounds of the present invention using recombinant DNA techniques for expressing DNA encoding ANVPs, proANVPs or pre proANVPs comprising Methods for using these compounds as diagnostic and therapeutic agents are also provided. In accordance with the present invention novel atrial natriuretic vasodilator polypeptide compounds ANVPs are provided for the regulation of fluid volume and blood pressure in host organisms, in which one aspect of the invention provides ANVPs substantially free of unrelated atrial tissue or products. Generally preferred embodiments of the present invention include compounds identified by the formula where X and Y are as previously defined, the cysteine residues are desirably bound by a disulfide bond and amino acid residues in parenthesis are alternatives to the residue immediately preceeding. Certain presently preferred embodiments included in the above formulae include or wherein amino acid residues in parenthesis are alternatives to the residue immediately preceeding, A further aspect of the invention provides nucleic acid sequences capable of directing the synthesis of ANVPs, proANVPs the precursor forms of the mature ANVP expression product compounds and pre proANVPs proANVPs with intact signal peptides , and fragments derived therefrom, such nucleic acid sequences comprising the DNA sequences of Figures 1 and 2, including oligonucleotide sequences contained therein, and allowing for the replacement of codons with other codons capable of directing the synthesis of the same or functionally equivalent amino acid sequences, such equivalent amino acids including the alternative residues disclosed in the examples provided. The nomenclature used to describe ANVP compounds of the present invention follows the conventional practice of using the first three letters of the trivial name of the amino acid and wherein the L form of any amino acid having an optical isomer is intended unless otherwise expressly indicated. Compounds within the scope of the present invention can also be obtained by modifying the above recited formulae in numerous ways while preserving the activity of the ANVP compounds thus obtained. For example, while the amino acids of these compounds are normally in the natural L form, one or more, usually two or less and preferably one amino acid may be replaced with the optical isomer D form, or a DL racemic mixture, as demonstrated in certain of the illustrative examples included in the present application. Amino acid residues contained within the compounds can also be modified by amidation, acetylation or substituted with other chemical groups which can, for example, change the solubility of the compounds without effecting their activity. In addition, one or more amino acid residues can be replaced by functionally equivalent residues for example basic polar amino acids can be replaced with other basic polar amino acids and acidic polar amino acids can be replaced with other acidic polar amino acids. However, the replacement of certain nonpolar hydrophobic amino acids, particularly cysteine, are considered less desirable due to the likelihood of interfering with the cystine disulfide bridge. The ANVP compounds of the present invention can also be modified by extending, decreasing or substituting in the compounds amino acid sequence, e.g., by the addition or deletion of amino acids or oligopeptides on either the N terminal or C terminal end, or both, of the sequences disclosed above. Particularly, Y can be amide or an amino acid or oligopeptide of not more than about 20, more usually 8, and desirably 5 or less amino acids and X can be N acetyl or an amino acid or oligopeptide of not more than about 125, and desirably about 101 amino acids, provided the modifications do not adversely effect all of the natriuretic, diuretic and vasorelaxant activities of the subject compounds. Furthermore, compounds of the present invention can be mixed with, bonded to or conjugated with compounds having the same or a complementary range of biologic activities to obtain the benefits of the present invention. Certain presently preferred ANVP compounds of the present invention have been isolated from atrial tissue substantially free of unrelated atrial tissue or products. Generally, acetic acid extracts of atrial tissue are subjected to gel filtration, and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography using C₁₈ and CN columns , while assaying for the natriuretic and vasorelaxant activity of the fractions. Compounds within the scope of the present invention can be isolated and purified from biological tissue sources, notably mammalian atrial tissue sources, or can be synthesized chemically by means well known in the art such as, e.g., solid phase synthesis. The synthesis is commenced from the C terminal end of the peptide using an alpha amino protected amino acid. t Butyloxycarbonyl Boc protective groups can be used for all amino groups even though other protective groups are suitable. For example, Boc Arg OH or Boc Tyr OH i.e., selected C terminal amino acids can be esterified to chloromethylated polystyrene resin supports. The polystyrene resin support is preferably a copolymer of styrene with about 0.5 to 2 divinyl benzene as a cross linking agent which causes the polystyrene polymer to be completely insoluble in certain organic solvents. Conveniently, ANVP compounds may be synthesized using manual techniques or automatically employing, for example, a Biosearch SAM II automatic peptide synthesizer Biosearch, Inc. San Rafael, California as described in the instruction manual. Alternatively, compounds of the present invention can be produced by expression of recombinant DNA constructs. Such production can be desirable to provide large quantities or alternative embodiments of such compounds. More particularly, modifications in the amino acid sequence of the various forms of pre proANVP, proANVP and ANVP compounds can be effected by various changes in the nucleotide sequence of the cloned structural gene used to direct the synthesis of the compounds. Included within such modification of the DNA sequence are the replacement of various codons with other codons which, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, direct the synthesis of the same amino acid. In addition, by codon substitution, one or more amino acid residues can be replaced by functionally equivalent residues, as disclosed above. Compounds of the present invention are shown to have natriuretic and diuretic activity in the intact mammal and in the kidney isolated from a mammal. Furthermore, compounds of the present invention including synthetic compounds, possess vasorelaxant activity, and inhibit the release of aldosterone that has been shown to be enhanced by oxidation and diminished by reduction, which indicates the presence of a disulfide bridge between the cysteine residues contained in the general formulae disclosed herein is required for the biological activity described above. Compounds of the present invention which are shown to have the above recited physiological effects can find use in numerous therapeutical applications such as, e.g., inducing natriuresis, diuresis, and vasodilatation. Thus these compounds can find use as therapeutic agents in the treatment of various edematous states such as, for example, congestive heart failure, nephrotic syndrome and hepatic cirrhosis, in addition to hypertension and renal failure due to ineffective renal perfusion or reduced glomerular filtration rate. These compounds can be administered to mammals for veterinary use such as with domestic animals, and clinical use in humans in a manner similar to other therapeutic agents, that is in a physiologically acceptable carrier. In general the dosage will range from about 0.01 to 100 µg kg, more usually 0.1 to 10 µg kg of the host body weight. Alternatively, dosages within these ranges can be administered by constant infusion over an extended period of time, usually exceeding 24 hours, until the desired therapeutic benefits have been obtained. These compounds can be administered neat, as mixtures with other physiologically acceptable active or inactive materials, or with physiologically suitable carriers such as, for example, water or normal saline. The compounds can be administered orally or parenterally, for example, by injection. Injection can be subcutaneous, intravenous, or by intramuscular injection. These compounds are desirably administered in pharmaceutically effective amounts and often as pharmacologically acceptable salts such as acid addition salts. Such salts can include, e.g., hydrochloride, hydrobromide, phosphate, sulphate, acetate, benzoate, malate, among others. Compounds of the present invention can also be used for preparing antisera for use in immunoassays employing labelled reagents, usually antibodies. Conveniently, the polypeptides can be conjugated to an antigen by means of dialdehydes, particularly from 4 to 6 carbon atoms and aliphatic, or carbodiimide. These compounds and immunologic reagents may be labelled with a variety of labels such as chromophores, fluorophores such as, e.g., fluorescein or rhodamine, radioisotopes such as ¹²⁵I, ³⁵S, ¹⁴C, or ³H, or magnetized particles, by means well known in the art. These labeled compounds and reagents, or labeled reagents capable of recognizing and specifically binding to them, can find use as, e.g., diagnostic reagents. Samples derived from biological specimens can be assayed for the presence or amount of substances having a common antigenic determinant with compounds of the present invention. In addition, monoclonal antibodies can be prepared by methods known in the art, which antibodies can find therapeutic use, e.g., to neutralize overproduction of immunologically related compounds The following examples are provided by way of illustration, rather than implying any limitation of the subject invention. In the experimental disclosure which follows, pre proANVPs, proANVPs and ANVPs derived from rat and human DNA sequences have amino acid residues numbered 1 152 and 1 151 respectively to indicate differences in the disclosed amino acid sequences. The amino acid sequence of chemically synthesized ANVPs are numbered from the arginine residue found at position 126 in the rat derived sequence and position 127 in the human derived sequence see Figures 1 2 . Compounds within the scope of the present invention have been isolated from atrial tissue in accordance with the following protocol. These compounds and their synthetic polypeptide analogs are included in the collective term ANVPs. A polypeptide compound was isolated from an acetic acid extract of atria, substantially free from unrelated tissue and products. Atria from 1400 male Wistar rats were homogenized in 8 volumes of 1 N acetic acid containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride PMSF Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo. , 3 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA and 5 uM pepstatin A pepsin and renin inhibitor, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO . This homogenate was centrifuged at 10,800 x g for 30 minutes and the pellet was rehomogenized in 4 volumes of the original buffer. The supernants from the extracts were pooled and neutralized with ammonium hydroxide. The neutralized supernatants were then centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 20 minutes and lyophilized. The lyophilized atrial extract was reconstituted in 6 ml buffer, centrifuged and loaded on a 2.5 X 45 cm gel filtration column of Sephadex G 50 fine, Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, NJ previously equilibrated with 1 N acetic acid. Aliquots from each fraction were dried Savant Speed Vac concentrator , reconstituted in phosphate buffered saline PBS and assayed for natriuretic activity in intact rat and for vasorelaxant activity using rabbit aortic rings. The results of this chromatographic step were as shown in Figure 3A, and the regions contained in horizontal bracket were lyophilized, reconstituted with 0.1 aqueous trifluoroacetic acid TFA , pooled and centrifuged. The pooled material was adjusted to 15 acetonitrile CH₃CN and applied to a 0.39 X 30.0 centimeter µ Bondapak C₁₈ column Waters, Inc., Milford, MA , using a Waters U6K injector and solvent delivery system Waters, Inc., Milford, MA . Bound material was eluted with a linear gradient of solvents A 0.1 TFA B CH₃CN from 85 15 to 45 55 over 40 minutes. Aliquots of the fractions were assayed for natriuresis in the isolated kidney and vasorelaxant activity as described subsequently. A broad region of coincident natriuretic and vasorelaxant activity was eluted and these fractions were pooled and dried. The material obtained and dried was reconstituted in A B, 78 22, and rechromatographed in 12 separate applications at 1.0 ml min. using a gradient of 22 to 34 B over 48 minutes. Aliquots of the fractions were tested for natriuretic and vasorelaxant activities as described. The results were as displayed in Figure 3B. Fractions from the three active peaks were pooled and dried overnight. The combined fractions from the second peak indicated by bracketed area in Figure 3B were reconstituted in A B, 77 23, applied to a C₁₈ column and eluted using a gradient of 23 to 29 B over 90 minutes. The results of this rechromatography were as shown in Figure 3C, where the bracketed area indicates fractions with vasorelaxant activity. Active fractions from 6 applications were pooled. The material thus obtained was applied to a 0.39 X 30 cm µ Bondapak CN column waters, Inc., Milford, MA . The solvent system used was A 0.1 TFA in water and B 0.055 TFA in CH₃CN . The sample was reconstituted in A B, 90 10, and chromatographed in three separate applications at 0.6 ml min. using a gradient of 10 to 30 B over 60 minutes. Vasorelaxant activity was determined by the reduction in tension produced in histamine contracted aortic rings as described subsequently. The most active peak, indicated by the bracket in Figure 3D, was dried and sequenced. The sequence was determined from one nanomole of protein using the Applied Biosystems 470A gas phase sequencer Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer. PTH amino acids were identified with a Beckman 334 T HPLC, using a 0.46 X 25 cm IBM CN column. The gradient applied was as indicated in Hunkapiller, N. W. and L. F. Hood, The following compound, isolated substantially free from unrelated rat atrial tissue and products has the sequence where X OH or Tyr OH Because of the methods used to assay the products of the purification procedure, natriuretic and vasorelaxant activity is an inherent property of the isolated and purified ANVP material. In the examples that follow, deoxyribonucleic acid DNA sequences encoding rat and human derived pre proANVPs and proANVPs are described. It is required that numerous alternative sequences can be constructed which will direct the expression of polypeptide embodiments of the present invention. Total RNA was isolated from rat atria by the method of Chirgwin, J.M. The polyadenylated RNA poly A RNA fraction was obtained by affinity chromatography using oligo dT cellulose as described by Aviv, H. and P. Leder, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA Double stranded cDNA was synthesized and prepared for insertion into the plasmid vector pUC8 Vieira, J. and J. Messing, Gene First strand cDNA was synthesized by the RNA dependent DNA polymerase from Avian Myeloblastosis Virus primed with oligo dT ₁₂ ₁₈. The RNA template was then removed by base hydrolysis. Second strand DNA was synthesized by RNA dependent DNA polymerase, relying on self priming at the 3 end of the first strand molecule, thereby forming a double stranded hairpin DNA. These molecules were blunt ended at the open ended termini using the large fragment of DNA polymerase I of Five µg of rat atrial poly A RNA yielded about 25 ng of cDNA, size selected to greater than 300 base pairs, and gave a library of about 200,000 independent recombinants. These recombinants were plated on nitrocellulose filters, replica plated and the library stored frozen on glycerol impregnated filters at 70 C with the protocol of Hanahan, D. and M. Meselson, Gene Amino acid sequences for native rat ANVPs, as determined in Section I, were used to design oligonucleotide probes to screen the rat atrial cDNA library, as described in Wallace, R.B. The cDNA library was then screened by colony hybridization using these probes. Four replica filters were prepared from each filter, so that each colony could be screened with each oligonucleotide probe pool. The filters were baked for 2 hrs. at 80 C under vacuum and then washed overnight at 68 C with shaking in a large volume of 3X SSC where 1X SSC is 0.15 M NaCl, 0.15 M sodium citrate, pH 7.5 0.1 SDS. The filters were prehybridized in 6X SSC, 0.1 SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 5x Denhardt s solution, 0.1 Ficoll, 0.1 polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1 bovine serum albumin 0.05 sodium pyrophosphate at 50 C for a minimum of 2 hrs. Filters were then hybridized with 2.5 X 10⁶ cpm ³²P labeled oligonucleotide probe mixture phosphorylated in accordance with Maniatis, T. A colony was considered positive if it hybridized with one probe from region number 1 and one probe from region number 2. One colony was chosen which hybridized strongly to the oligonucleotide probes pools a and c and hybridized to a random primed atrial cDNA probe but not a ventricular cDNA probe. Sequencing of this clone demonstrated that it encoded rat pre proANVPs. This clone is referred to as pNFl. The purified DNA insert, obtained from pNFl, was prepared using small miniprep methods Maniatis The amino acid sequence of native rat pre proANVP was determined from the cDNA nucleotide sequence. A single open reading frame encoding a 152 amino acid sequence was disclosed, extending from the initiation codon ATG at base 85 to the termination codon TAA at position 541. Biologically active ANVPs see Figure 5 can be identified in the amino acid sequences of human and rat pre proANVPs see Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively . Atrial and ventricular poly A RNA was subject to Northern blot analysis after fractionation by electrophoresis on a 1.4 agarose gel containing methylmercuric hydroxide by the method of Bailey, J.M. and N. Davidson, Anal. Biochem. The cDNA sequence for pre proANVP determined above indicates that pre proANVP has a molecular weight of approximately 16,500 daltons. To determine the actual precursor size, atrial mRNA encoding pre proANVP was purified by hybrid selection Goldberg, M.L. Hybrid selected RNA and total poly A RNA was translated using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system Bethesda Research Labs, Gaithersburg, Maryland in the presence of 250 uCi ml ³⁵ S methionine. Translation products were fractionated by 2 dimensional gel electrophoresis by loading 1 X 10⁶ cpm of acid precipitable radioactivity per sample. The first dimension was an isoelectric focusing gel using a gradient from pH3.5 10, O Farrell, P.Z. The results were as indicated in Figures 6b and 6c, where the position of several atrial specific translation products having molecular weights between 12,000 and 30,000 daltons are marked by arrows. Translation products encoded by pNFl hybrid selected atrial RNA are indicated in Figure 6d which shows at least 3 related protein species having molecular weight between 18,000 and 20,000 daltons which are major atrial specific species. Figure 6e shows that hybrid selection does not recognize any ventricular specific proteins. Because the proteins in Figure 6d were hybrid selected, are atrial specific and are of the correct molecular weight range, they represent pre proANVPs. The cDNA isolated from pNFl encoding rat pre proANVP provided a probe for identifying the human gene. A human genomic clone library in bacteriophage Charon 4A Lawn, R.M. The size of the native human pre proANVP gene was determined to permit identification of a full length clone. Two mg of high molecular weight DNA was prepared from 20 g of rat liver by the method of Blin, N. and D Stafford, Nuc. Acid Res. The six human genomic clones that hybridized to rat pre proANVPs cDNA were then analyzed for the presence of a similarly sized fragment and one of them, designated λHG6, contained such a fragment. λHG6 DNA was then digested with For the human gene, the 2589 base pair fragment shown to hybridize with the rat cDNA was prepared from a large scale plasmid prep by 4 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Before sequencing could proceed, the large size of the DNA segment dictated that several useful restriction endonuclease cleavage sites be determined which would break the sequence into smaller fragments. Particularly useful sites were found at positions 586 A human fetal heart, obtained at 26 weeks of gestation, was used to prepare poly A mRNA, as described in section II. From a total of 1.7 gm of heart tissue 60 µg of poly A mRNA was isolated. Double stranded cDNA was prepared as described in Manniatis, T. The size fractionated cDNA was then cloned into the bacteriophage λ vector, λgt10, as described by Huynh, T.V. The cDNA library was screened by plague hybridization as described by Maniatis, T. Using the amplified human fetal heart cDNA library, phage were plated on plates using the host strain BNN102. Nitrocellulose filters were lifted from these plates, baked for 2 hours at 80 C under vacuum, and hybridized to 5 X 10⁵ cpm of ³²P labelled rat pre proANVP cDNA, pNF1 insert. Hybridization was in 40 formamide, 50mM Na phosphate pH 6.5, 5x Denhardts solution 0.1 Ficoll, 0.14 M polyvinylpyridine, 0.1 bovine serum albumin , 5xSSC, 50 µg ml salmon sperm DNA and 50 µg ml yeast RNA for 16 hours at 42 C. The filters were washed twice for 30 minutes in 1xSSC 0.1 SDS at 50 C and autoradiographed. A total of twenty hybridizing phage corresponding to human pre proANVP cDNA clones were then identified. Twelve of the positively hybridizing phage were chosen and were purified to homogeneity by replating. Phage DNA preps were made from these human pre proANVP cDNA clones and the DNA was digested with The The nucleotide sequence of the human pre proANVP cDNA clone number 6 is shown in Figure 1B. The clone was compared to the rat pre proANVP cDNA to confirm that it corresponds to human ANF pre proANVP. This cDNA clone extends from the region corresponding to amino acid 15 through the human pre proANVP coding region and contains all of the 3 untranslated region. It therefore contains all of the sequences coding for the biologically active components of human proANVP and is suitable for expression in foreign systems. Compounds of the present invention were synthesized by solid phase techniques. Synthesis were performed manually or, alternatively, on a Biosearch SAM II automated peptide synthesizer Biosearch, San Rafael, California using t Boc amino acids in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer.

The peptide was then lyophillized and resuspended in a solution of 0.1 M NH₄HCO₃, pH 8.0 at a peptide concentration of 100 µg ml. The suspended peptide was exposed to air for 48 hours to promote slow reoxidation. The peptide was then lyophillized.

One g of Boc Phe pMBHA Resin was obtained using schedule B, with the required sequence of amino acids introduced in order as Boc Ser Bzl OH, Boc AsnOH, Boc Cys 4 CH₃Bzl OH, Boc GlyOH, Boc LeuOH H₂O, Boc GlyOH, Boc Ser Bzl OH, Boc GlnOH, BocAlaOH, Boc GlyOH, Boc IleOH 1 2H₂O, Boc Arg Tos OH, Boc Asp OBzl OH, Boc IleOH 1 2H₂O, Boc Arg Tos OH, Boc GlyOH, Boc GlyOH, Boc PheOH, Boc Cys 4 CH₃Bzl OH Boc Ser Bzl OH, Boc Ser Bzl OH, Boc Arg Tos OH . The peptidyl resin was then suspended in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride HF containing 10 anisole, 2 Ethyl methyl sulfide for 30 min. at 10 C, and 30 min. at 0 C. The HF was removed by evaporation under vacuum and the peptide resin mixture was suspended in diethyl ether. The peptide resin mixture was washed twice with diethyl ether, once with chloroform, once with diethyl ether, once with chloroform and once with diethylether. The peptide was extracted from the mixture with 2.0 M acetic acid, diluted with H₂O and lyophilized, to give the unoxidized dihydro peptide. The crude peptide was dissolved in deoxygenated 0.01 M ammonium acetate NH₄OAc , pH 8, to 0.5 mg ml and then oxidized by dropwise addition of a slight excess of 0.01 M potassium ferricyanide KCN solution stirred 20 minutes and pH adjusted to 5 with acetic acid. The peptide solution was treated with DOWEX AG3X4 anion exchange resin, filtered, diluted with H₂O and lyophilized to give the crude cyclized peptide. Purification of the peptide was achieved by desalting on Sephadex G 25F using 0.5 M AcOH as eluant, followed by ion exchange chromatography on CM Sepharose Pharmacia Fine Chemicals or CM cellulose Whatman using a gradient elution generated by addition of 300 mM NH₄OAc, to a solution of 0.01 M NH₄OAc, pH 4.5. Fractions collected having a minimum 97 purity as judged by reversed phase HPLC were pooled and lyophilized from H₂O several times to yield the purified rANVP 126 148 acetate salt. Following the procedures outlined in Examples III.A.1 4, with appropriate modification, the following ANVPs were synthesized The biologic activities of native and chemically synthesized ANVP compounds and analogs were determined using The activity of rANVP 126 149 was measured in the isolated rat kidney. Functioning isolated rat kidneys were perfused in a closed circuit system, as described in Camargo, M.J.F. These results also show that in isolated kidneys perfused in the absence of vasoconstrictors, the compounds of the present invention increased renal vascular resistance, filtration fraction and glomerular filtration rate. In contrast, in isolated kidney precontracted with endogenously generated angiotensin, the compounds decreased vascular resistance. These effects with the synthetic compounds show that ANVPs can have both renal vasoconstrictive and vasorelaxant activity depending on the absence or presence of endogenous vasoconstrictors. The natriuresis observed in the isolated kidney can result from a renal vasoconstrictive effect preferentially expressed in the efferent arteriole. In a similar manner, the effects of other ANVPs were examined in the isolated rat kidney. Table II summarizes the effects of these peptides on urinary flow rate, urinary sodium excretion and glomerular filtration rate. It should be noted that all ANVP s tested in this system increased urine flow rate and urinary sodium excretion. Relatively few unrelated peptides effect flow rate and sodium excretion in this manner in the isolated rat kidney. Thus the observed effects are specific to the ANVPs and related analogs. These effects are presumably mediated by the interaction of the ANVPs with specific receptor sites within the kidney. Isolated rat kidneys were treated as described in Table I. Control periods for each compound are denoted by C and experimental periods following the addition of compounds are denoted by E. V urine flow rate U Since the native ANVPs relax precontracted blood vessels, the effects of these peptides were studied on isolated thoracic aoetic rings from rabbit and on isolated vascular wall cells of bovine origin. The synthetic ANVPs were compared to partially purified gel filtration step and purified HPLC native ANVPs for their ability to relax histamine contracted aortic rings. Rings were suspended in 10 ml aerated Kreb s buffer under 1.5 g passive tension. Rings were precontracted with 5 X 10 ⁶ M histamine, washed and allowed to return to baseline tension, as described Kleinert, H. D. 1984 , As shown, both purified native rANVP 126 150 and synthetic rANVP 126 150 relaxed the tissue at the same doses. In addition, hANVP 127 151 is equivalent to rANVP 126 150 in this tissue. However, rANVP 127 150 , the equivalent of atriopeptin III described by Geller, In order to relax precontracted aortic vessels, the ANVP compounds must first bind to specific membrane receptors. Associated with this ligand receptor interaction is an increase in intracellular cyclic GMP Winquist Binding assays were performed as follows ANVPs were labelled with ¹²⁵I according to the procedure of Schenk, As shown in Figure 9, the ¹²⁵I ANVP binds to the cells in a specific and saturable manner. Specific and saturable binding is a necessary component of a hormone receptor interaction. Furthermore, ¹²⁵I ANVP binding can be displaced by unlabelled ANVP compounds and not by a variety of hormones angiotensin, epinephrine, vasopressin, glucagon that act at other receptor sites. Thus, the displacement of ¹²⁵I ANVP binding by ANVPs and analogs as a function of concentration is a reflection of their potency to bind to the vascular wall and alter the contractile state of the vessel. Concentrations at which ANVPs and related analogs displace ¹²⁵I ANVP from binding sites on vascular smooth muscle cells are outlined on Table III. These data demonstrate that of the disclosed embodiments D Ala¹⁴² rANVP 126 150 , rANVP 126 150 and hANVP 127 151 are most reactive with vascular wall cells. Since the agonistic action of ANVP in vascular smooth muscle not only results from binding to specific receptors, but is also associated with increases in cyclic GMP, the effects of ANVPs and analogs on cyclic GMP accumulation were examined using the same cultured cells. Figure 10 demonstrates the magnitude of ANVP mediated cyclic GMP increases in cultured aortic smooth muscle and endothelial cells. In Figure 11A B, the relative activities of ANVP and analogs on cyclic GMP accumulation in aortic smooth muscle and endothelial cells are shown. The data is plotted in a dose response relationship log dose vs of maximal cyclic GMP increases . Once again, a distribution in potency over three orders of magnitude can be seen. The rank order of potency in both cell types is D Ala¹⁴² rANVP 126 150 D Ala¹³¹ rANVP 126 150 rANVP 126 150 rANVP 126 149 hANVP 127 151 rANVP 127 150 other D amino acid substitutions. These data will reflect the vasodilatory potency of these peptides in bovine aorta. Thus, the data demonstrate that certain D amino acid substitution increase potency, while others decrease potency. Furthermore, the data imply that removal of the carboxy terminal tyrosine residue has little effect on vascular reactivity. Furthermore, the data confirm the observation that the amino terminal arginine residue is important for maximal reactivity. Synthetic ANVP compounds rANVP 126 149 , rANVP 126 150 and hANVP 127 151 were also found to be natriuretic in the intact rat. These compounds were administered as a bolus injection to Inactin anesthetized rats 100 mg kg, average weight 399 g which were maintained on a constant infusion of normal saline at 2.2 ml hr. The results were as shown in Table IV, wherein the change in each parameter was assessed by the difference between the average of three control periods 10 mins. each and the first experimental period maximum response . Data are expressed as mean SE. Renal and hemodynamic effects have also been measured in anesthetized dogs receiving a constant infusion of the compound rANVP 126 149 1 µg kg bolus, followed by 0.1 µg kg min for 1 hour . Immediate effects were noted on blood pressure, GFR and urine flow rate and electrolyte excretion which were sustained throughout the infusion. The experimental data presented for these parameters in Table IV are the average values obtained during the infusion. Mean arterial pressure MAP fell consistently by 10 15 while GFR rose by 25 35 , in association with a sustained diuresis and natriuresis Table V . All these parameters returned to control i.e. pre infusion levels during the recovery period i.e. following termination of the infusion . The peptide produced significant decreases in plasma renin activity PRA and plasma aldosterone PA , as shown in Table V. Additional studies demonstrate that this substance also inhibits the ability of angiotensin to stimulate aldosterone production by isolated adrenal cells. Thus, ANVPs are able to block the effects of the renin angiotensin system at several levels 1 they antagonize the direct actions of angiotensin on its target organs blood vessels and the adrenal and 2 inhibit renin secretion, which leads to a reduced rate of angiotensin formation in the blood. Based on the above data, it is evident that the synthetic and tissue derived ANVP compounds possess similar activity, desirably after the synthetic ANVP compounds have been allowed to oxidize to promote the formation of disulfide bridges. It is also evident from the above results that the subject compounds can be used as a potent vasorelaxant, diuretic and natriuretic in mammalian hosts. In the examples that follow the expression of prorANVP 87 152 prorANVP 25 152 , prohANVP 26 151 and prohANVP 102 151 in Plasmid pEA300 Amman, E. PKK10 2 Brosius, J., Gene The ten oligodeoxynucleotides shown in Figure 12E were synthesized and purified as described above. 500 pmole of each oligodeoxynucleotide except 1 and 10 were phosphorylated individually in 20 µl containing 60 mM Tris Cl, pH 8, 15 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl₂, 20 µci of ³²P γ ATP and 20 units of polynucleotide kinase P L Biochemicals for 30 min. at 37 C. This was followed by the addition of 10 µl containing 60 mM Tris HCl, pH 8, 15 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl₂, 1.5 mM ATP and 20 additional units of polynucleotide kinase followed by another 30 min. incubation at 37 C. Following incubation the samples were incubated at 100 C for 5 min. 500 pmole of oligodeoxynucleotides 1 and 10 were diluted to 30 µl in the above buffer without ATP. 16.7 pmole of each oligodeoxynucleotide constituting a double standard pair e.g. oligodeoxynucleotides 1 and 2, 3 and 4 etc. Figure 12E were mixed and incubated at 90 C for 2 min. followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Each pair was then combined with the others in the construction and extracted with phenol chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation. The oligodeoxynucleotide pairs were reconstituted in 30 µl containing 5 mM Tris HCl, pH 8, 10 mM MgCl₂, 20 mM DTT, heated to 50 C for 10 min. and allowed to cool to room temperature followed by the addition of ATP to a final concentration of 0.5 mM followed by the addition of 800 units of T4 DNA ligase and incubated at 12.5 C for 12 16 hours. The ligation mixture was extracted with phenol chloroform and the DNA ethanol precipitated. The dried DNA was reconstituted in 30 µl and digested with Plasmid PKK233 2 see Section IV.A.1.a.ii. was digested to completion with Twenty nanograms of plasmid pKK 233 2 Nde was digested to completion with Plasmid pNF1 see above was digested to completion with Following an incubation at 65 C for 5 min. the ligation mixture was adjusted to 100mM NaCl and incubated for 2 hrs. at 37 C with The expression plasmid, pKT52 was digested to completion with To confirm that the reading frame of the cloned proANVP sequence in pKT 52 was correct, pRNF 6852 was digested with As shown in Figure 12B, plasmid pRNF 6852 was designed to express a fragment of the rat proANVP cDNA which encodes a protein from amino acids 87 to 152. Because a synthetic decamer An IgG fraction was prepared from 1 ml of non immune serum or anti serum raised against a chemically synthesized rat ANVP peptide using Protein A Sepharose 4B Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden chromatography as described in the manufacturer s specifications and collected in a total volume of 4 ml. The dried TCA pellet was resuspended in 40 µl of 50 mM Tris Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 SDS and incubated at 100 C for 5 min. Ten µl of this mixture representing total bacterial protein was diluted to 20 µl with 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 6.8, 22 glycerol, 2 SDS, 2 2 mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 bromphenol blue, followed by incubation at 100 C for 5 min. The remaining 30 µl used for immunoabsorption of the mixture was diluted to 1 ml with 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.15 M NaCl, and 2 Triton X100, followed by the addition of 40 µl of purified IgG derived from non immune serum or antiserum raised against rat ANVP. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and 4 C overnight. Following the overnight incubation, 50 ul of Protein A sepharose 4B 10 suspension in 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.5 Nonidet P 40 NP 40 and 1 mg ml ovalbumin was added to the mixture and incubated at 4 C for 1 hr with gentle agitation. Following centrifugation at 4 C, the supernatant was discarded and the Protein A Sepharose pellet resuspended in 0.5 ml of 50 mM Tris HCl, pH7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5 NP 40, and 1 mg ml ovalbumin. The pellet was washed by vigorous vortexing, followed by centrifugation and removal of the supernatant. This procedure was repeated four additional times. The Protein A Sepharose pellet was washed an additional two times with 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 0.15 M NaCl and 0.5 NP 40, followed by one wash with 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5. Following drying The total and immunoabsorbed samples were subjected to discontinuous SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described by Anderson, C.W. A comparison of the polypeptide patterns from cells containing plasmids pKT 52 or pRNF 6852, labeled with L ³⁵S cysteine as described above, is shown in Figure 13. A polypeptide with an approximate molecular size of 6200 daltons appears uniquely in lane C, which represents the total polypeptides derived from pRNF 6852. This polypeptide is specifically immunoreactive only to anti ANVP IgG lane D . In addition, there was no detectable reaction of immune IgG with any polypeptide derived from pKT 52 lane B . Thus, it was concluded that the predicted fragment of proANVP was expressed in cells containing the specific plasmid pRNF 6852. In a manner similar to that described in Section C.2, full length proauriculin was expressed. To accomplish this, plasmid pNFl see above was digested to completion with which had been synthesized on a SAM I DNA synthesizer Biosearch Inc. and purified by preparative gel electrophoresis as described. T4 DNA ligase was added to this mixture to ligate the linker onto the digestion products. Digestion of the ligation mixture with Following transformation of JA221 1pp F lacI A plasmid having both Plasmid pRNF 12852 Figure 12D encodes a protein encompassing residues 25 through 152 of the rat proANVP precursor with the additional methionine codon ATG preceding the codon AAT which corresponds to residue 25. A comparison of the polypeptide patterns from cells containing plasmids pKT 52 or pRNF 12852, labeled with L ³⁵S cysteine as described above is shown in Figure 13, lanes A and E, respectively. One major polypeptide species with an approximate molecular size of 18,400 daltons appear uniquely in lane E marked by arrows which represents the total polypeptides derived from pRNF 12852. This polypeptide was specifically immunoreactive only to anti ANVP IgG whereas there was no detectable reaction of immune IgG with any polypeptide derived from pKT 52 compare lanes B and F in Figure 13 . The 18,400 dalton polypeptide observed in Figure 13F is believed to be rat proANVP starting at amino acid 25 following an initiator methionine as shown in Figure 12D. The plasmid pHGRBl containing the human genomic DNA was digested to completion with The ligation mixture was digested with Following transformation of JA221 1pp F lacI A plasmid having an Because a synthetic using dideoxynucleotide sequence analysis as described Sanger, λ phage DNA from clone 6 containing the human ANVP cDNA Section II.C was digested with which had been synthesized and purified as described followed by the addition of T4 DNA ligase to ligate the linker onto the The expression plasmid pTRP 233 Figure 12F was digested to completion with As shown in Figure 12G, plasmid phNF 233 was designed to express full length human proANVP encompassing residues 26 through 151 of the human pre proANVP protein with an additional methionine codon, ATG, preceeding the codon AAT which corresponds to residue 26. Immunoabsorption of L ³⁵S cysteine labeled polypeptides derived from cells containing phNF 233 or pTRP 233 was accomplished as described in Section IV.A.2. using antisera raised in rabbits injected with synthetic rat ANVP 127 152 . Total and immunoabsorbed L ³⁵S cysteine labeled polypeptides were analyzed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography as described in Section IV.A.2. A comparison of the polypeptide patterns from cells containing plasmids pTRP 233 or phNF 233 labeled with L ³⁵S cysteine is shown in Figure 14. A major polypeptide with an approximate molecular weight of 18,000 daltons appears uniquely in lane B which represents the total polypeptides derived from phNF 233 as compared to lane A which represents total polypeptides derived from pTRP 233. This 18 K dalton polypeptide is specifically immunoreactive to anti ANVP antisera whereas reaction with polypeptides derived from pTRP 233 was not detected compare lanes C and D in Figure 14 . The predicted polypeptide of human pro ANVP 26 151 was therefore expressed in cells containing the specific plasmid phNF 233. Resulting immunoreactive column fractions were pooled and lyophilized. The dried material was brought up in approximately 4 ml of distilled water and submitted to high performance liquid chromatography HPLC purification. The material was applied to a 1 X 25 centimeter Vydac C₁₈ column Vydac 218TP1010 using a Perkin Elmer Series 4 LC injector and solvent delivery system Perkin Elmer . The bound material was washed for 2 minutes with aqueous 15 acetonitrile CH₃CN and 0.1 trifluoroacetic acid TFA which was followed by the development of a linear gradient of CH₃CN and 0.1 TFA from 15 85 to 60 40 over 45 minutes. Aliquots from 1 minute fractions were collected and portions dried and assayed for immunoreactivity using an anti ANVP radioimmunoassay as described. The peak of immunoreactivity was subsequently collected and dried One hundred pmoles of material was submitted to automated amino acid sequence analysis using a Model 470A protein sequenator Applied Biosystems Inc. . The first 18 amino acids analyzed were Met Asn Pro Met Tyr Asn Ala Val Ser Asn Ala Asp Leu Met Asp Phe Lys Asn . No other detectable impurities could be observed from this analysis. SDS polyacrylamide gel analysis, as described in section IV.2.b, also revealed no other detectable impurities of the purified material which migrated with an apparent molecular size of 18,000 daltons. From the sequence analysis of this polypeptide described above it was concluded that this polypeptide corresponds to full length human 26 151 pro ANVP with an additional amino terminal methionine and contains undetectable contamination from bacterial polypeptides. In the examples that follow the expression of various proANVP and ANVP polypeptides in Two procedures are disclosed for the preparation of vectors for intracellular expression in the yeast Using this vector, any sequence of DNA in the pre proANVP sequence can be inserted and used to express a desired fragment of pre proANVP. For example, insertion of the 454 bp ANVP containing fragment into the A second procedure for intracellular expression of pre proANVPs also allows extracellular secretion of proANVPs and fragments thereof. In the second procedure, a restriction fragment containing the entire pre proANVP precursor coding region is isolated from the plasmid pNF4 by first digesting the plasmid with the restriction enzyme A yeast library in the Two fragments of DNA from pNFl Section II.A.3. encoding pre proANVP were inserted into the unique A DNA was prepared from The α factor proANVP fragment processing scheme is shown in Figure 15. The mRNA transcript is initiated and terminated from the α factor sequences in the vector. This is translated into a chimeric protein and initiated through the yeast secretory process. Proteolytic processing of this protein occurs both at the Glu Ala QA residues and the Lys Arg KR residues in the α factor portion of the molecule Kurjan J. and I. Herskowitz, The molecular weights of the proteins whose synthesis and secretion is directed by YEp α NF 9 are not inconsistent with the possibility that an endogenous yeast protease cleaves the ANVP peptide from the proANVP precursor encoded by the Cells were removed by centrifugation and the cell free supernatant used either directly or concentrated by lyophilization. Ten volumes of acetone were added to the aqueous solution and the mixture allowed to precipitate on ice for 10 15 minutes. The precipitate was then pelleted by centrifugation, and the acetone removed. A small amount of water no more than 1 volume was added to this pellet to facilitate resuspension. Ten volumes of methanol were then added to this mixture, extensively mixed, and the precipitate collected by centrifugation The supernatant was then removed and dried under vacuum. This pellet was resolubilized in 1.0 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer and immunoprecipitated and washed as described in Section IV.A.2. As shown in Figure 16B, the complexity of proteins as determined after the above extraction procedure is relatively simple compared with the complexity of total secreted protein. Lanes 1 and 2 in Figure 16B show the secreted ³⁵ S Cys labeled protein whose synthesis is directed by YEp α NF 7 and YEp α NF 5 respectively in the methanol soluble fraction. Lanes 3 and 4 in Figure 16B show the same proteins following immunoprecipitation in both cases with anti ANVP IgG. The antiserum appears to specifically precipitate a 3,000 Dalton protein from YEp α NF 5 lane 4, Figure 16B while no protein was precipitated from the corresponding inverse orientation YEp α NF 7 lane 3, Figure 16B . Lanes 5 and 6 show a similar immunoprecipitation of ³⁵ S Cysteine labeled proteins appearing in the methanol soluble fraction of media conditioned by yeast cultures harboring plasmids YEp α NF 12 and YEp α NF 9, respectively. The result is the same as shown for lanes 3 and 4, Figure 16B, and a 3,000 Dalton protein was specifically immunoprecipitated from media conditioned by These results suggest that both yeast expression plasmids, YEp α NF 5 and YEp α NF 9, direct the synthesis of a 3 kd ³⁵ S Cys labeled protein approximately 25 30 amino acids in length which is immunoprecipitated by specific anti ANVP IgG. Plasmid YEp α 8 Section IV.B.2.b. was digested to completion with Plasmid pJJ 1 was digested to completion with The synthetic DNA sequence shown in Figure 17B was designed with the set of preferred yeast codons derived from the codon usage in the highly expressed yeast genes encoding the glycolytic enzymes. The eight oligodeoxynucleotides shown in Figure 17B were assembled as described in Section IV.A.1.b. Following ligation, the mixture of DNA was digested with Plasmid JCl 5 was digested to completion with Plasmid pJC 2 encodes the α factor signal leader peptide Kurjan, J. and Herskowitz, I., To positively identify the immunoreactive peptide, The dried material was resuspended in 5 ml of acetic acid and submitted to high performance liquid chromatography as described in Section IV.A.5. The immunoreactive peak fraction was isolated and 200 pmoles submitted to automated amino acid sequence analysis as described Section IV.A.5. . The resulting amino acid sequence was In addition, contaminants due to yeast polypeptides were not detectable by this method of analysis. In the examples that follow, the expression of prorANVP 25 152 and prohANVP 26 151 in CHO cells is described. These examples are provided by way of illustration and it will be readily understood that any pre proANVP, proANVP, or ANVP can be expressed in mammalian cells in the same manner. To facilitate the expression of rat pre proANVPs in mammalian cells, a hybrid gene was constructed in which the coding segment for rat pre proANVP was fused to a powerful regulated promoter derived from the human metallothionein II hMTII gene. This was performed in two steps. First, an expression vector was prepared. The expression vector, pHSI, carries 840 nucleotide base pairs of hMTII sequence Karin, M. To complete the construction of the hybrid gene, the Autoradiograms of ³⁵S Met labeled proteins secreted into the media reveal the appearance of a 18,000 dalton protein that is specifically immunoprecipitated by anti ANVP IgG. This protein is not seen in ³⁵S Methionine labelled proteins of cells containing a control plasmid. Thus CHO cells containing pMT NF 1 10 secrete proANVPs into the media of these cells. Chinese Hamster Ovary CHO cells containing pMT NF1 10 were deposited with the ATCC on May 31, 1984 and accorded accession number CRL 8569. Human pre proANVPs was expressed in a similar manner with appropriate modifications to account for the features of the human genomic clone. Briefly, a plasmid, HGRB 1, carrying the Cultured CHO cells which were transformed with pHNF 8 were subcloned by plating cells at low dilutions in dishes containing Harris F 12 medium supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum. Individual subclones were subsequently removed and each examined for pro ANVP production by both radioimmunoassay Section V and radiolabelling with ³⁵S methionine. The ³⁵S methionine labelled proteins were resolved by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Shown in Figure 18B are the results of these experiments. Lane 2 shows ³⁵S methionine labelled proteins from control CHO cells. Lane 1 shows ³⁵S methionine labelled proteins from a CHO pool transformed with pHNF 8 prior to subcloning. Lanes 3 6 show ³⁵S methionine labelled proteins from four subclones containing pHNF 8 and are designated CHO 8 2 6, CHO 8 2 55, CHO 8 2 81, CHO 8 2 93. In each of the subclones distinct ³⁵S methionine labelled bands appear at 18,000 and 10,000 daltons. The bands were identified as proANVP 18,000 k and a proANVP fragment comprising the amino terminus of this protein by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies. The fact that the subclones are producing proANVP was confirmed by radioimmunoassay as described in Section V. It should be noted that the 10,000 dalton form implies that a substantial portion of proANVP is being cleaved by proteolysis in this system. Such a proteolytic event yields the amino terminal fragment 10,000 k and smaller carboxy terminal fragments containing shorter ANVP s. Thus, the clones are considered important for producing proANVP and smaller fragments with or without the biologically active ANVP segment. Chinese Hamster Ovary CHO cells containing pHNF 8 and designated CHO 8 2 81 were deposited with the ATCC on April 9, 1985 and accorded accession number CRL 8782. Various rat and human proANVPs and ANVPs whose expression and secretion are directed by the yeast α factor system described in Section D.2 and the Samples of the above expressed material were also tested for natriuretic and diuretic activity using the isolated perfused rat kidney model as described by Camargo, M. The human proANVP 128 151 purified as described in Section IV.B.2.d. was subjected to assays as described above and displayed the full range of biological activities. In a manner similar to the yeast expressed active material, rat and human pre proANVPs, proANVPs and ANVPs expressed by the bacterial and mammalian cell expression systems described in Section IV.A and IV.C, respectively, have been shown to possess biological activity. The rat proANVP fragments 87 152 and 26 152 whose syntheses were directed by plasmids pRNF 6852 and pRNF 12852, respectively, in Purified human proANVP 26 151 prepared from In the case of mammalian cell expression, both prorANVP 25 152 and prohANVP 126 151 produced in CHO cells exhibited biological activity similar to that observed above. The proANVP proteins expressed using the above described recombinant DNA techniques in yeast, bacteria and mammalian cells all contain the common ANVP sequence where the bracketed amino acid residue is Met in human ANVPs and Ile in rat ANVPs. The proANVP fragments expressed in the systems described above show potent vasorelaxant, natriuretic and diuretic activities Tables VII, VIII and IX . These same and related activities have also been demonstrated with rANVP 126 150 and hANVP 127 151 . Thus, these expressed fragments should share all properties with a synthetic ANVP, both on As demonstrated in the above examples, the methods and compositions disclosed can find use in expressing pre proANVPs, proANVPs and fragments thereof, and ANVPs. It is apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art that any sequence or fragment of polypeptide disclosed herein can be expressed by employing minor modifications to this disclosure, while remaining within the scope of the invention. In particular, any fragment of the pre proANVPs amino acid sequence disclosed can be expressed. Certain of these fragments will not contain the complete sequence of ANVP, but may contain portions of ANVPs. These fragments can themselves demonstrate biological activity comparable with or complementary to the activities disclosed for the instant compounds. In addition, human derived proANVPs, fragments thereof and ANVPs contain a single amino acid replacement compared to the biologically active rat derived polypeptides. Therefore yeast, bacterial and mammalian cell expressed human derived compounds, prepared in the manner previously described, will display similar biological activity. Compounds of the present invention were used to provide immunoassays, particularly radioimmunoassays, for the determination of the presence or amount of ANVPs in samples. Antibody to ANVPs was produced by immunizing New Zealand white rabbits subcutaneously and intramuscularly with 250 µg ANVP conjugated to bovine serum albumin in complete Freund s adjuvant. Rabbits were boosted at three week intervals with an identical quantity of conjugate in incomplete Freund s adjuvant. The rabbits were bled from the ear artery 7 10 days after a boost and the resulting serum was tested for its ability to bind ANVP. Parallel control non immune serum samples were also tested. Table V presents data from a representative experiment in which the ability of antisera to interact specifically with ANVPs was examined. ANVP 500 nanograms was immobilized at individual wells of a polystyrene plate. Varying dilutions of antisera wore then added to these wells and the amount of antibodies specifically bound was quantified by adding ¹²⁵I labeled sheep anti rabbit IgG antisera. This is a standard method for determining specific antibody titres. As shown in Table X, at a serum dilution of 1 400 significant quantities of antibody were still binding to ANVPs. Specific binding was not observed with non immune serum. The experiment depicted in Table XI is identical to that of Table X, however, varying concentrations of non immobilized ANVPs were added concurrently with a 1 100 dilution of anti ANVP antiserum. As shown, non immobilized ANVPs competitively displaced antibody binding from immobilized ANVPs. Thus, this serves as an example of a competitive displacement assay. This assay and similar radioimmunoassays, can be used to quantify ANVP like immunoreactivity in tissues or serum under a variety of physiological or pathophysiological states. Thus far, the assay has been used to detect ANVP in atrial extracts. ANVP was not detected in ventricular extracts. Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of clarity and for purposes of understanding, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that modifications of the invention may be practiced while remaining within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
