# Voltage protective apparatus for variable frequency power system.

## Abstract
An apparatus for detecting a voltage in a variable fre quency power system equipped with a variable frequency power unit 2 in a path extending from an AC power supply line 1 to a load, wherein the threshold value of a protective re lay 5 functioning upon occurrence of an abnormal voltage in the power system is determined in accordance with a physical quantity proportional to the system frequency.
