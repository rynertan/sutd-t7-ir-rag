## Description
The present invention relates to a method for selecting hybridomas i.e. immortal clones which produce antibodies specific to domains of a surface antigen which is usually not accessible at the surface of intact cells, and in particular to the P glycoprotein surface antigen correlated with multidrug resistance Juliano, R.L. Ling, V. Clinical resistance to combination chemotherapy poses a major obstacle to the successful treatment of neoplastic disease such as cancer. The underlying mechanisms of such clinical resistance are largely unknown. No diagnostic reagents are currently available to define the nature and degree of resistance in a patient, and thereby facilitate a rational choice of treatment, or provide a basis for more accurate prognosis. Numerous investigators have developed mammalian tissue culture and The striking correlation between P glycoprotein expression and the expression of the multidrug resistance phenotype raises the possibility that P glycoprotein might serve as a diagnostic marker for the detection of multidrug resistant malignant cells in cancer patients. Also, because the P glycoprotein is found in different mammalian species, it probably plays an important functional role in the mammalian cell surface. What this role might be in multidrug resistant cells, or in normal tissue, is not yet understood. We have now found it possible to obtain monoclonal antibodies that would serve as versatile analytical reagents, preferably recognizing homologous regions of the P glycoproteins of different species. For this reason, in designing a strategy for selecting monoclonal antibodies specific for P glyoprotein, several theoretical considerations were taken into account. Firstly, P glycoprotein bears a carbohydrate moiety which may account for 20 30 of its molecular size Ling, V., Kartner, N., Sudo, T., Siminovitch, L. Riordan, J.R. Because of these theoretical considerations, a screening method for immortal clones hereinafter also referred to as hybridomas was designed that would avoid relying on a cell surface binding assay, and that would guarantee the selection of monoclonal antibodies which would serve as useful reagents for immunoblotting. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for preparing a monoclonal antibody specific for a conserved region located in the C terminal portion of the P glycoprotein cell surface antigen correlated with multidrug resistance in mammalian species said antibody having cross reactivity with P glycoprotein cell surface antigens of different mammalian species and said antibody being further defined by its ability to bind isolated plasma membranes of multidrug resistant cells and its inability to bind live cells, comprising According to another aspect of the present invention therefore there is provided a monoclonal antibody specific for a conserved region located in the C terminal portion of the P glycoprotein cell surface antigen correlated with multidrug resistance in mammalian species said antibody having cross reactivity with P glycoprotein cell surgace antigens of different mammalian species and said antibody being further defined by its ability to bind isolated plasma membranes of multidrug resistant cells and its inability to bind live cells. Accordingly, the invention provides a method for selecting immortal clones which produce antibodies specific to domains of a cell surface antigen which is usually not accessible at the surface of intact cells, comprising the steps of immunizing a suitable mammal with cell or tissue fractions containing plasma membranes of a mammalian cell line of interest immortalizing antibody producing cells from said immunized mammal to form a plurality of immortal antibody producing clones and screening said clones for production of antibodies specific against said antigen immobilized on a solid substrate. The invention also provides hybridomas which produce antibodies, i.e. monoclonal antibodies, specific for such cell surface antigens, and particularly P glycoprotein, as well as such monoclonal antibodies themselves when such hybridomas and monoclonal antibodies are produced by the aforesaid method of the invention. A preferred embodiment of the invention will be described by way of non limiting example with reference to the drawings in which In the preferred method of the invention, mice were immunized with sodium dodecyl sulphate SDS solubilized plasma membranes of multidrug resistant Chinese hamster ovary CHO and human cell lines. Hybridomas were formed from spleen cells taken from the mice by fusion with a suitable fusion partner see Example 1 below . Using a cross species panel of detergent solubilized plasma membranes immobilized on nitrocellulose filter test strips, it was ensured that the monoclonal antibodies selected would bind to conserved, drug resistance specific epitopes in the denatured antigen, as they would be presented in protein immunoblots Western blots after SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS PAGE . Results of a hybridoma screening, using nitrocellulose test strips, are shown in Fig. 1. As expected, a number of different specificities were observed, including those toward common mammalian, CHO or human antigens Fig. 1 f, e and c, respectively . More importantly, specificities toward membranes of resistant cell lines, either CHO or human, or both, were observed Fig. 1 b, d and a, respectively . The majority of strips are negative or only weakly stained. Specificities other than those indicated in Fig. 1 were only rarely seen and generally did not breed true. Primary screening of hybridoma supernatants of 1,007 wells which were positive for growth yielded 71 wells positive for drug resistant cell membrane 19 against human only, 37 against CHO only, an 15 against both . After expansion of these wells and secondary screening, 21 strongly positive wells remained 2 against human only, 5 against CHO only, and 14 against both . Hybridomas specific for drug resistant membranes were cloned twice by limiting dilution, using the above screening method to select specific antibody producing clones. Eight stable clones were ultimately isolated 3 against CHO only, and 5 against both CHO and human . Losses of specific antibody secreting hybrids were presumably due to their genetic instability. The primary screening results probably reflect the presence of an initial population of unstable specific antibody producing hybrids, rather than a large proportion of false positives. All further characterization was accomplished using the final, twice cloned hybridomas. The results of the initial screening of the hybridomas clearly indicate that some differences in the binding sites recognized by the different antibodies are to be expected. For example, three of the eight final clones showed no affinity for membranes of drug resistant human cells. In order to characterize these differences more precisely, supernatants from cloned hybridomas were screened with a larger panel of drug sensitive and resistant plasma membranes. Test strips were also prepared for immuno blotting plasma membranes of sensitive and resistant CHO cells after SDS PAGE. Figure 2 A and B shows the results of these experiments. In Fig. 2 A the results of dot blotting a larger panel of cell lines allows the classification of the eight monoclonal antibodies into three distinct groups I, II and III according to the pattern of staining obtained. No significant staining of drug sensitive cell membranes was observed for any cell line, with any of the eight monoclonal antibodies. The monoclonal antibodies in Group I appear to stain all drug resistant membranes tested. Those of Group II stain drug resistant CHO and mouse membranes, but stain human membranes only very poorly. The single member of Group III stains drug resistant CHO and human membranes, but not those of mouse. Other minor differences are also observed among the three groups. In order to determine the molecular sizes of the antigens being stained by the monoclonal antibodies, Western blots of drug sensitive and drug resistant plasma membranes were overlayed with hybridoma supernatants and developed using a radiolabelled second antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 B , all of the antibodies stained a major drug resistance specific band of approximately 170,000 daltons. It is of interest that faint bands of lower molecular weight are also stained. These bands are variable among different preparations of plasma membranes from the same cells, and may be proteolytic fragments of the major staining band. None of these minor bands are observed in membranes of drug sensitive cells. Similar putative breakdown products have been described previously, when using polyclonal rabbit antisera specific for P glycoprotein of multidrug resistant plasma membranes Kartner, N., Riordan, J.R. Ling, V. Differences in the peptide maps and in the staining patterns against a panel of different plasma membranes suggest that there may be three different antigenic sites. To provide more direct evidence of differences among the eight monoclonal antibodies and to determine the spatial relationships of their binding sites, competitive binding studies were performed with ascites of the different hybridomas and purified, radio labelled representatives of the three antibody groups. Typical competition assay results are shown in Fig. 3. These results clearly allow the classification of the antibodies into three groups I, II and III on the basis of their binding to three spatially distinct epitopes. In the direct competitive binding assay of eight monoclonal antibodies against purified, radioiodinated antibody shown in Fig. 3, the target antigen was plasma membrane vesicles from CH The evidence presented above strongly suggests that the monoclonal antibodies under investigation bind the P glycoprotein of multidrug resistant cells, but this conclusion needs to be corroborated by testing the antibodies on cell lines which have been used previously to define the P glycoprotein. Although dot blots have shown differential staining of drug resistant cell membranes, it is not clear that the same antigen is bound in each case. Previous work has shown that homologous P glycoproteins of consistent molecular weight are expressed in all multidrug resistant cell lines so far tested Kartner The foregoing demonstrates that detergent solubilized and denatured P glycoprotein immobilized on nitrocellulose filters is detected with the monoclonal antibodies under study. In many applications for diagnostic or research purposes it is important that an antibody be capable of detecting the antigenic site as it is presented in intact cells and tissues. In this regard it has been found, using both radiolabelled antibody and indirect, immunofluorescence staining, that none of the monoclonal antibodies binds the surface of intact multidrug resistant cells. Nonetheless, as is seen in Fig. 4 B , using fixed and permeabilized cells, the monoclonal antibodies are capable of labelling the surface membrane of resistant CHO and human cells. It is apparent from this work that the epitopes defined by the monoclonal antibodies are either cryptic, or exposed on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. When native plasma membrane vesicles are spotted onto nitrocellulose, all eight antibodies bind to them at least as well as to SDS solubilized membranes, showing that protein unfolding is probably not a requisite for epitope recognition. It is presumed therefore, that the antibodies bind the exposed cytoplasmic domain of relatively native P glycoprotein in disrupted, or inside out membrane vesicles. Fig. 4 C demonstrates that with the use of flow cytometry the degree of staining of cells with these monoclonal antibodies can be determined semi quantitatively and correlates with the degree of drug resistance of the cells. Such a relationship exists between the degree of drug resistance and the amount of P glycoprotein expressed in drug resistant cells, Kartner This same correlation, which is obtained between fluorescence intensity and the degree of drug resistance of the resistant cells shown in Fig. 4 C , is strong corroborative evidence that P glycoprotein is being stained specifically. Furthermore, Fig. 4 B and C demonstrates that these monoclonal antibodies are indeed useful as reagents for the staining of cells and tissues. In addition to their use in indirect immunofluorescence methods, the antibodies have been used in conventional immunoperoxidase staining techniques. The Group I monoclonal antibody, C219, has been used to obtain a 700 bp cDNA probe, pCHP1, from a λgt11 expression library of the multidrug resistant CHO cell line, CH In summary, a strategy has been designed and employed to select for monoclonal antibodies that bind conserved, multidrug resistance associated antigens after SDS denaturation and immobilization on nitrocellulose. The method of hybridoma screening used in the present work is a generally useful technique for producing monoclonal antibodies against cell surface antigens. It assures reagents that will be useful for identifying antigens in the powerful Western blotting technique. Furthermore, it avoids some of the possible problems associated with cell surface binding assays and, thus, provides a complementary alternative for hybridoma screening. The method also provides a means of generating antibodies to cytoplasmic domains of membrane antigens. These domains are of great interest because of their functional association with the cytoplasm of the cell, and they have, as yet, rarely been characterized in detail. In the production of monoclonal antibodies that differentially bind plasma membranes of multidrug resistance cells, eight different antibodies were obtained. It is significant that all eight antibodies show specificity toward the same antigen, the P glycoprotein, supporting the notion that the expression of P glycoprotein is the major alteration of the multidrug resistant cell surface. Furthermore, each of the eight antibodies binds one of three distinct epitopes confined to a region less than 240 amino acids in length. This domain is apparently accessible only on the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane and is presumably in the C terminal region of the P glycoprotein polypeptide. It is interesting that three independent antigenic sites are clustered in this region. This suggests that the domain is relatively more immunogenic than the majority of the protein. Possibly this region represents a hydrophilic domain in an otherwise relatively hydrophobic protein. Alternatively, it has recently been suggested that regions of a polypeptide that are conformationally more fluid are more likely to be antigenic. Thus, the termini of polypeptides are often relatively antigenic regions. It is also of interest that no antibodies that bind an extracellular domain of the P glycoprotein were obtained. The carbohydrate moiety, in particular, should be relatively unaffected by detergent solubilization and, for other glycoproteins, this moiety often accounts for a high proportion of antigenic sites. One explanation for the present observation is that carbohydrate determinants of P glycoprotein might be common to other glyconjugates, present in both drug sensitive and drug resistant cells, and would not be detected in a differential screening assay. Alternatively, recognition of the extracellular domain of P glycoprotein as a self antigen, particularly if this domain is structurally conserved among mammalian species, could account for this observation. The epitopes which have been defined in the cytoplasmic domain of the P glycoprotein do not appear to be equally represented in different mammalian species. One of the epitopes described Group I is detected equally well in rodent and human P glycoproteins and, therefore, appears to be highly conserved. The Group II epitope is detected in hamster, less well in mouse, and very poorly in human P glycoprotein. This observation may reflect a species related structural divergence in this region of the protein. On the other hand, the Group III epitope is detected in hamster and less well in human P glycoprotein, but very poorly in mouse. This epitope could represent a more variable region of P glycoprotein structure. Another explanation might be that different members of a P glycoprotein multigene family are expressed in different cell lines. This possibility as been previously proposed as a possible mechanism for variation in the cross resistance patterns of multidrug resistant cells selected from common parental lines. The particular drug of selection, and possibly the characteristics of the parental cell line, may affect the amplification and overexpression of specific genes, or specific combinations of genes. Recently, Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA with a P glycoprotein specific cDNA probe pCHP1 has provided strong evidence in support of a multigene family of P glycoproteins. The antibodies described in the present work are the first molecular probes available for the assessment of the role of P glycoprotein in human tumours and for the elucidation of the molecular biology of the multidrug resistance phenotype. Clinical application of the monoclonal antibodies for diagnosis of therapy resistant disease is an obvious utility for this invention. Early detection of elevated levels of P glycoprotein in tumours might indicate a departure from routine chemotherapy an application of novel treatments that may circumvent the multidrug resistance phenotype. Preliminary findings of elevated amounts of P glycoprotein in some ovarian carcinomas of patients failing chemotherapy demonstrate the utility of the present monoclonal antibodies for this purpose. Furthermore, these reagents will be useful in the sensitive and specific detection of P glycoprotein in experimental systems and in normal mammalian tissues. This will allow the study of the biosynthesis and functional role of P glycoprotein in drug resistant cells. Such studies will provide insights into structure and function at the mammalian cell surface, and also will establish a theoretical basis that might lead to improved chemotherapy of presently nonresponsive neoplastic disease.
