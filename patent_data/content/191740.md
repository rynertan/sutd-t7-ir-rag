# Temperature and current protection for quadruple voltage regulator.

## Abstract
A quadruple voltage regulator 20, 40, 60, 80 , having four independently controllable power circuits in a single integrated circuit, comprises a current sensor 24, 44, 64, 84 for each of the power circuits. Each current sensor provides an active output signal when the magnitude of the current provided by the corresponding voltage regulator exceeds a selected limit. A single temperature sensing device 12 monitors the temperature of the integrated circuit and generates a control signal when the temperature exceeds a selected threshold temperature magnitude. The output sig nal of each current sensor is independently combined with the control signal from the temperature selector to disable the corresponding voltage regulator circuit when the tem perature exceeds the threshold magnitude coincident with an excess current provided by the regulator.
