# Belt conveyor arrangement.

## Abstract
A continuous belt 14 has upper and lower runs 14a, 14b and lower runs 23a, 23b of continuous ropes 23 car ried and driven by end rollers 12, 13 and intermediate wheels 22 . To allow the lower run 14b of the belt to be supported by the lower run 23b of the ropes, the lower run of the belt is laterally diverted from below the lower run 23b of the ropes and re diverted back onto the lower run of the ropes by rollers 30 in the region of one end roller 12 . The lower run of the belt is again diverted laterally and re diverted below the lower run 23b of the ropes adjacent the other end roller 13 . In an other embodiment, the belt 114 is twisted whilst the lower run of the ropes 123 is vertically diverted to allow space for the twisting of the lower run of the belt below the upper run of the belt, so that lateral movement of the belt beyond the normal confines of the conveyor arrangement is avoided.
