# Diglyceride manufacture and use in making confectioner s butter.

## Abstract
Saturated triglycerides are reacted with glycerol in the presence of either a glycerolysis catalyst or a pre formed glycerate to provide a product which is a mixture of mono glycerides. triglycerides, 1, 2 diglycerides and 1,3 diglycerides. The mixture is stored in the presence of a low temperature rearrangement catalyst at a storage temperature below the melting point of the gylceride ester components of the mixture and substantially all of the mixture is converted into 1 ,3 diglycerides. In this way there are prepared, for example, 1 palmitoyl, 3 stearoyl diglyceride, 1,3 distearoyl diglyceride and 1 ,3 dipalmitoyl diglyceride, which are appropriate precursors for the synthesis of confectioner s hard butters, and the like.
