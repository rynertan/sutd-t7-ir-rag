# Improvements in and relating to fluidic contactors.

## Abstract
A fluidic contactor comprising a vortex stage and a separator stage. The vortex stage is in the form of a vortex chamber 7 whereby fluids of different densities when introduced into the chamber 7 through one or more tangential inlets 9 are caused to swirl through the chamber before passing into the separator stage which is in the form of a column 6 forming an extension of an axial outlet from the vortex chamber. In passing along the column 6 the fluids become separated and emerge through separated outlets 11, 12 at the end of the column remote from the chamber. The fluids can be mixed together before entry into the chamber or separate fluids can be intimately mixed together in swirling through the chamber, in each case to permit mass transfer of constituents between the fluids.
