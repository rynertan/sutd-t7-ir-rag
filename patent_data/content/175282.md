## Description
TITLE DIRECT PROCESS FOR PREPARING SILOXANES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThe present invention relates to a process for preparing siloxanes more particularly and in a preferred embodiment, the present invention is a direct process for the preparation of cyclic and oligomeric dimethylsiloxanes by the fluidized bed reaction of copper activated silicon with dimethyl ether and a methyl halide.Description of the Prior ArtAlkylsiloxanes, especially the dimethylsiloxanes, find extensive use in emulsions, antifoams and pastes on account of their low surface tension, high surface activity, good spreading power, chemical inertness and thermal stability. The direct synthesis of the dimethylsiloxanes from dimethyl ether and suitably activated silicon has been of interest for many years. This has been so because a successful synthesis would reduce the cost and complexity associated with the state of the art process. Currently, a mixture of methylchlorosilanes is made by the RochowDirect Reaction see, e.g., U.S. A 2,380,995 .This mixture is separated via a multiplate distillation to obtain high purity dimethyldichlorosilane, which is subsequently hydrolyzed to cyclic and linear dimethylsiloxanes and HC1 equation 1 EMI2.1 n 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8Descriptions of the state of the art technology are given in the monographs W.

Voorhoeve, Methylchlorosilanes Precursors to Silicones , Elsevier, NY 1967 and in the review W. Buechner, wOrganometallic Chemistry Reviews, Library 9, pp 409 431.Corrosion and pollution problems attend the handling and recovery of the liberated HCl. However, the gas may be recycled to the synthesis of HSiC13 or used to prepareCH3C1 from CH3OH for the Rochow Direct Reaction. Some silicones manufacturers use methanol in place of water and obtain CH3C1 as the by product equation 2 D 14,331 EMI3.1 Small amounts of HC1 and CH3 20 are also formed, and if not removed, have undesirable effects on the rate and selectivity of the Rochow Direct Reaction i.e., on the synthesis of the methylchlorosilanes .It is to obviate these complexities that there has been much interest in obtaining the direct synthesis of dimethylsiloxanes fron silicon and dimethyl ether equation 3 EMI3.2 Although not wishing to be bound by theory, the overall process proposed by equation 3 may actually involve the intermediate synthesis of dimethyldimethoxysilane followed by hydrolysis to the cyclic and oligomeric dimethylsiloxanes equation 4 EMI3.3 Methanol can be dehydrated to dimethyl ether equation 5 , which could then be recycled.EMI3.4 Japanese patent 286 1951 Chem. Abstr. 47, 3334 1953 discloses that dimethyldimethoxysilane and methyltrimethoxysilane were obtained in good yield from the reaction of silicon, containing 10 copper catalyst, and dimethyl ether at 400 4300C in a fixed bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. However, an exhaustiveD 14,331 investigation of the reactivity of activated silicon with ethers in fixed bed reactors by Rochow and Zuckerman TheReaction of Ethers with Silicon1, PB 157357, NTIS. U.S.Dept. of Commerce later showed that disclosure to be erroneous see, e.g., U.S. A 4,088,669 at column 1, lines 52 61 . Rochow and Newton Inorg. Chem. 9, 1072 1970 also failed to realize methylmethoxysilane formation when the reaction was attempted in a slurry of silicone oil at 3000C. Fredin, et. al., Abstracts 184thNational ACS Meeting, Kansas City, MO, March 12 17, 1982. INOR 60 showed that whereas groundstate silicon atoms reacted spontaneously with methanol at 10 K in an argon matrix, no reaction was observed with dimethyl ether.Photoexcitation of the Si atoms was necessary in order to achieve insertion into the C O bond of the dimethyl ether.The co reaction of mixtures of dimethyl ether and hydrogen chloride with silicon copper mixtures and contact masses has been disclosed in US A 2,459,539,GB A 642,997 and by Turetskaya, et. al. Russ. J. Gen. Chem. 44 12 , 2738 1975 . In each case the principal products were methylchlorosilanes. Presumably, methylchloride was first formed equation 6 and it then reacted with silicon to give the methylchlorosilanes.EMI4.1 U.S. A 4,088,669 discloses that dimethyldimethoxysilane is the main product from the reaction of dimethyl ether and methylbromide with activated silicon at 200 3000C under autogenous conditions. The patent specifies that a closed reaction vessel is necessary in order to get dimethyl ether to react with silicon and that D 14,331 activating traces of tin, mercury and copper and long reaction times 1 100 h were essential to the success of the synthesis. More particularly, Example 13 of the patent indicates that no reaction product was obtained, under a variety of reaction conditions, when gaseous dimethyl ether was continuously passed through a fixed bed of powdered, copper activated silicon.The overall process was thought to proceed as described in equations 7 9 Speier, et. al., Abstracts 13th OrganosiliconSymposium, Univ. of Michigan, March 30 31, 1979 see also, column 4, lines 16 22, of U.S. A 4,088,6690. The patent describes CH3Br as having a catalytic function.EMI5.1 EMI5.2 The method disclosed in said U.S. A 4,088,669 is attended by serious disadvantages when applied on a large scale. The confinement of a large mass of reacting silicon particles in a closed vessel and maintenance of said mass at a uniform temperature between the limits 200 3000C specified therein necessitate special means to obtain adequate heat transfer and mass transfer through the reaction mixture in order to avoid hot spots.Hot spots lead to pyrolysis of the methyl bromide and dimethyl ether and the formation of surface deposits which inhibit further reaction of the silicon mass. Both dimethyl ether critical temperature 1290C and methyl bromide critical temperature 1940C have critical temperatures less than the lower temperature limit set forth in the patent. Consequently, they are both gaseous D 14,331 under the reaction conditions specified. Agitation e.g., by stirring, rocking or shaking of the mass is required in order to obtain adequate heat transfer and continually expose fresh surface for reaction. Problems associated with stirring large masses of abrasive silicon particles have been discussed in U.S. A 2,887,502 and 2,389,931 and are well known to those skilled in the art of the Rochow synthesis.While the use of an inert solvent, as specified in U.S A 4,O88,669, reduces the heat and mass transfer problens, said solvent must be free of impurities which inhihit the synthesis of diinethyldinetfloxysilane. Recycle of the solvent is essential for the economic practice of this synthesis. Hence additional processing steps e.g., filtration and distillation which add to the complexity of the synthesis are required.Contrary to these teachings, it has now surprisingly been found that the direct synthesis of organosiloxanes and their precursors may be accomplished successfully in a fluidized or agitated bed reactor with contact times substantially less than 7 hour. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention is a process for the direct synthesis of cyclic and oligoeric organosiloxanes comprising reacting a hydrocarbon ether and a hydrocarbon halide with a fluidized or agitated bed of activated silicon particles with a maximum contact time of five minutes and continuously withdrawing products from that reaction. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTSIn its preferred form, the direct synthesis of this invention is perforned in a conventional gas solid reactor such as a stirred bed or fluidized bed reactor. It is necessary that the reactor system not be closed. That is, arrangements must be made for the continuous withdrawal or removal of the products of the direct synthesis. This may be accomplished using conventional techniques and equiplnent. Accordingly, the reaction temperature must be greater than the boiling points of the reactants and products. The boiling points referred tn hero are nnt T.0 bar necessarily those atl O mm Hg but those appropriate to the pressure conditions in the reactor.A conventional means of cooling and condensing the hot product mixture in a vessel separate from but directly attached to the gas solid reactor may also be provided if desired.It is also necessary that the activated silicon particles be maintained in a state of agitation i.e., stirred or fluidized so as to facilitate heat and mass transfer and avoid hot spots in the reaction medium. Other operational details pertinent to gas solid reactors are well known to those skilled in the art and thus will not be fully described herein. The same reactor may be used for silicon activation and subsequent reaction with hydrocarbon halide and hydrocarbon ether. Alternatively, the silicon activation and reaction may be conducted in separate reactors, provided the activated silicon is transported to the second reactor in an inert atmosphere.Pure silicon does not react with the hydrocarbon halide, methyl chloride, below about 4000C. As pointed out above, even atomic silicon is unreactive towards the hydrocarbon ether, dimethyl ether. Hence the silicon must be activated in order that the combined reaction with the hydrocarbon ether and hydrocarbon halide can be successful. The preferred activator is copper because it allows the lowest reaction temperatures to be used.Silver is also suitable. It is essential that the activator e.g., copper and silicon be in intimate contact to permit diffusion of copper or other activator into the silicon and the formation of an alloy or solid solution. Copper has a high diffusion rate in silicon and this rate increases with temperature Ward andCarroll, J. Electrochem. Soc. Solid State Sci. Tech.129 1 , 227 1982 1. Temperatures above about 3000C are therefore commonly employed for activation.In the case of the preferred activator, copper, activation may be accomplished by, for example, solidifying a melt containing copper and silicon and comminuting the solid into particles or by heating particles of silicon and copper together as described in U.S.i 2,380,996 or preferably by heating mixtures of copper oxides and silicon in the presence of hydrogen and or hydrogen chloride see, e.g., U.S.A 4,n4,908 and 2,380,997 or by heating copper salts e.g., cuprous chloride and silicon see, e.g., Voorhoeve, et. al., J.Catalysis 4, 123 1965 . Similar methods may be employed with activators other than copper. Various other activators and other methods of activation are known in the art and have been described in the above mentioned monographs by Voorhoeve and Petrov, et. al.The amount of copper required to activate the silicon is usually less than about 10 by weight of the silicon used. In general, amounts of from 0.5 to 3 by weight have been found to be optimum. An increase in the amount of copper catalyst within this range or even beyond has only a negligible effect on the results of the direct synthesis.The silicon employed in the synthesis is preferably technical grade material containing 90 98 by weightSi, with the remainder composed of such elements as Fe,Ca, Mg, Al, Sn, B, Cu, Cr, Zn, Ti, Cd, Bi and Sb and other impurities. Impurities present in technical qrade silicon have been described by Lobusevich, et. al. Russ. J.Appl. Chem. 49 10 , 2236 1976 . Preformed metal silicides such as those of iron, calcium, magnesium and copper may also be employed in the synthesis either as individual phases or admixed with elemental silicon.A broad range of particle sizes, e.g., 28 x D mesh i.e., no more than 500 um may be used in the synthesis.However, it is preferred that the copper activated silicon particles be smaller than about 48 mesh i.e., less than 300 um . Smaller particle sizes contribute to good fluidization of the bed and assist heat transfer. The particle size range employed in any given reaction depends on the size of the reactor and the scale of the synthesis. In laboratory experiments, the preferred particle size range was 65 x 150 mesh i.e., 104 208 um but this size distribution is not absolutely necessary for the success of the synthesis.Additives known to have a demonstrably beneficial effect on the rate and selectivity of the Rochow Direct Reaction may also be preferably employed. The best known of these additives are zinc powder, anhydrous ZnC12, ZnO and ZnCO3. However, others such as cadmium salts see, e.g., U.S. A 3,446,829 , cobalt salts, antimony and bismuth salts see, e.g., the Noll and Voorhoeve monographs, supra are also suitable. These additives may be introduced at the silicon activation stage and or during the reaction of the hydrocarbon halide and hydrocarbon ether with the activated silicon particles.It is known in the art that these additives promote the formation of dialkylsilyl compounds. Consequently, their employment is expected to favor a high content of the desired organosiloxanes.The amount of the zinc additive employed may be 0.2 0.5 by weiqht of the silicon charged to the reactor.Larger amounts lead to increased ZnC12 formation in the reacting mass and difficult fluidization of the bed.Additionally, excess ZnC12 may be transported from the bed and enter the reaction product where it may catalyze condensation reactions of the alkoxysilanes and lead to the formation of silicone gum. While the latter are desirable products in some cases, in the present invention it is preferable to avoid their formation and obtain fluid siloxanes. The hydrocarbon ethers which may be employed in the present invention are those having at least one, and preferably two, aliphatic hydrocarbon groups bonded to the ether oxygen, and may be represented by the general formula R1 O R2, wherein R1 and R2, which may be the same or different, each represents an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical, which may be saturated or unsaturated, or an aromatic hydrocarbon radical with the proviso that at least one of R1 and R2 is an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical such as an alkyl radical. Thus diaryl ethers are excluded, but dialkyl ethers are suitable.Also suitable are alkyl aryl ethers such as methylphenyl ether, and ethylphenyl ether. Preferred ethers are the structurally symmetric ones of the general formulae ROR, wherein R is a monovalent aliphatic hydrocarbon radical, which may be saturated or unsaturated, containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Representative of this class are methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl, vinyl and allyl radicals. Structurally unsymnietric ethers such as methylethyl ether lead to siloxanes containing more than one type of alkyl residue bonded to silicon.Notwithstanding their usefulness, these mixtures are commercially less desirable than those siloxane products containing only one kind of alkyl group bonded to silicon and thus are not as preferred for purposes of the present invention. The commercial utility of the dimethylsiloxanes, and the ready availability at an inexpensive price and ease of handling in gas solid reactions of dimethyl ether all contribute to making dimethyl ether the preferred hydrocarbon ether of this invention.The hydrocarbon halide which nay be employed in the present invention may be chosen from among those known to react with copper activated silicon in the Rochow DirectSynthesis, and may be represented by the general formulaR3X, wherein R3 represents a saturated or unsaturated aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon radical, such as an alkyl, vinyl or phenyl radical, and X represents a halogen atom. Suitable examples are methyl chloride, methyl bromide, ethyl chloride, ethyl bromide, vinyl chloride, chlorobenzene and bromobenzene. Methyl chloride and methyl bromide are the preferred hydrocarbon halides. For the direct synthesis of cyclic and oligomeric dimethylsiloxanes devoid of halogen atoms or alkoxy groups bonded to silicon, methyl bromide is preferably employed.Methyl chloride favors formation of the precursors, dimethylmethoxychlorosilane, dimethyldimethoxysilane, dimethyldichlorosilane, C , dichloro dimethylsiloxanes and , S chloromethoxy dimethylsiloxanes .The total amount of gaseous reactant i.e. hydrocarbon ether plus hydrocarbon halide employed in this invention must be, as a minimum, sufficient to fluidize the activated silicon particles and must, of course, be less than that flow which completely discharges or elutriates the activated silicon particles from the bed before they are reacted. The minimum flow for fluidization is computed from a knowledge of the gas densities, the density and particle size distribution of the activated silicon particles and the temperature of the reaction, as described for example in the monograph, FluidizationEngineering by D. Kunii and 0. Levenspiel, John Wiley BR Sons, New York 1969 . It is possible to operate the bed at many times this minimum flow and still keep the reacting activated silicon particles contained in the reactor in a fluidized state.For the laboratory preferred average particle size of about 149 um and reaction temperatures of 300 3500C, the minimum linear fluidization velocity is approximately 0.15 cm sOperational values of 2 5 times this minimum flow are preferred.Both the hydrocarbon halide and hydrocarbon ether must simultaneously be in contact with the activated silicon particles to realize successful direct synthesis of the desired organosiloxanes. They may be introduced to the reactor via separate conduits. However, it is preferred that metered quantities of hydrocarbon halide and hydrocarbon ether be admixed and then injected into the reactor through a common conduit. Example 3 shows that dimethyl ether and activated silicon alone do not react under the preferred conditions of this invention.Likewise, injection of dimethyl ether into the head space of a reactor in which the Rochow Direct Synthesis was being practiced did not result in the formation of the desired dialkylsiloxanes.At the preferred fluidization velocities, superficial contact times of about five seconds to about five minutes are obtained, and are therefore preferred, depending on the height of the fluidized bed of activated silicon particles.The molar proportion of hydrocarbon halide to hydrocarbon ether is not critical and may be varied to determine the type of products formed during the reaction. Low hydrocarbon halide to hydrocarbon ether molar ratios i.e., less than about 1 lead to low levels of siloxane formation and favor the formation of hydrocarbonoxy intermediate compounds such as the dialkylhaloalkoxysilanes and dialkyldialkoxysilanes. Moreover, as that ratio increases beyond about 6 to 1, formation of intermediates such as diorganodihalosilanes are favored over siloxanes. Hydrocarbon halide hydrocarbon ether molar ratios of 1 1 to 6 1 favor the formation of the desired cyclic and oligomeric organosiloxanes.Preferred hydrocarbon halide to hydrocarbon ether molar ratios are in the range of 1 2.0. When the starting reactants in the process of the instant invention are the preferred alkyl halide and dialkyl ether, all alkyl radicals being the same, the reaction product may contain the following classes of products 1. Monomeric alkylhalosilanes of the general formula RaSiBbX4 a b, wherein a and b are integers greater than or equal to zero, 4 a b is greater than zero, R represents an alkyl group, and X represents a halogen atom e.g., CH3 2SiHCl, CH3 3SiHCl, CH3SiHC12 CH3 2SiC12. 2. Monomeric alkylalkoxy and alkylhaloalkoxy silanes of the general formulae R2Si OR X and R2Si OR 2, wherein R and X have the same meaning e.g., CH3 2Si OCH3 Cl, CH3 2Si OCH3 2.3. Alkylhalodisiloxanes of the general formula RaSi2OXb, wherein R represents an alkyl group, a and b are each an integer greater than zero and a b 6 e.g., CH3 3SiOSi CH3 2Cl, CH3 3SiOSiC12CH3. 4. Alkylhaloalkoxydisiloxanes of the general formula RaSi2O OR bXc, wherein R represents an alkyl group, a, b and c are each an integer greater than zero and a b c 6 e.g., Cl CH3 2SiOSi CH3 20CH3, C12CH3SiOSi CH3 2OCH3.5. Hexa alkyl disiloxanes of the general formula R3SiOSiR3 wherein R represents an alkyl group e.g., CH3 3SiOSi CH3 3. 6 a Linear trialkylsilyl endblocked trisiloxanes and oligomeric siloxanes of the general formula MDn M wherein n is an integer of 1 to 7, M a R3SiOl 2 D R2SiO and R is an alkyl group e.g., CH3 3SiO CH3 2SiO nSi CH3 3 6 b Functionalized siloxanes of the class just defined in 6 a of the formulae MDnSixaRb wherein a and b are each an integer greater than or equal to zero, a b 3, and M, n, x and D are as defined above, e.g., CH3 3SiO CH3 2SiO nSiC12CH3i or MDnSi OR aRb wherein M, n, D, R, a and b have the same meaning e.g., CH3 3SiO CH3 2SiO nSi OCH3 CH3 2 7. Honocyclic dialkylsiloxanes of the general formula wherein D has the same meaning as above and n represents an integer of 3 to 8 e.g., CH3 2SiO n It is preferred that the process of the present invention be performed to obtain predominantly the members ofClasses 6 and 7 above. The compounds of Classes 1 5 are considered to be the precursors of the desired siloxanes produced by the process of the present invention. When the preferred hydrocarbon halide, methylbromide, is employed, the members of Classes 6 a and 7 tend to predominate when the preferred hydrocarbon halide, methylchloride, is employed, the members of Class 6 b tend to predominate.Generally, when the preferred operating conditions are followed, the members of Classes 6 and 7 predominate over the compounds of Classes 1 5. Distillation of the product mixture to obtain individual compounds is not critical to the utility of this invention. The gaseous portion of the reaction product is essentially a mixture of hydrocarbon ethers and hydrocarbon halides of different composition from that at the inlet. In the preferred practice of this invention, this mixture is analyzed e.g., by gas chromatography to determine the hydrocarbon halide to hydrocarbon ether molar ratio, is reconstituted with additional hydrocarbon halide and or hydrocarbon ether to obtain molar ratios in the range 1.0 2.0, and is then recycled to the direct synthesis of the siloxanes. For the higher boiling liquid components, their normal boiling points are such that they fall into groups roughly equivalent to the classes 1 through 7 defined above.Accordingly, a distillation can be performed if desired to obtain individual distillates corresponding to each class of product.The minimum temperature of the direct process of this invention is set by the minimum temperature at which the hydrocarbon halide reacts with the activated silicon.These temperatures are recorded in the above cited monographs by Voorhoeve and Petrov, et. al. For example, they are 2900C for CH3C1 and 1950C for C2H5C1 and for CH3Br. Maximum temperatures are determined by the temperatures of onset of hydrocarbon halide pyrolysis.Optimum temperatures are those which permit both facile reaction and volatilization of the products without the complexities of pyrolysis. Accordingly, the operational temperature range for this invention at atmospheric pressure is 250 4000C, preferably 325 3600C.The process of the present invention may be conducted at atmospheric pressure or at super atmospheric pressures up to 4,14 bar abut 60pounds per square inch gauge , as is conventional for the direct reaction. At higher pressures, temperatures lower than 300 400 C may be employed, as is apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. The particular pressure at which the process is operated is not critical, and those skilled in the art can select an appropriate pressure.Of course it is to be understood that storage containers, reactors, transport lines, pumps, valves and other fittings employed in the apparatus to effect the reactions of the instant invention, all of which are conventional, and which come into contact with, or are reasonably expected to come into contact with the hydrocarbon halides, hydrocarbonhalosilanes, hydrocarbonhalohydrocarbonoxysilanes and the various siloxanes of this invention as defined above must be corrosion resistant, especially at the preferred temperatures.The following examples, together with comparison Example 3, illustrate the preferred embodiments of the instant invention under laboratory conditions. The examples are based on work which was actually performed.All experiments were conducted in laboratory Vycor fluidized bed reactor of overall length 66 cm. The upper 10 cm of the reactor was an expanded head, 6.5 cm internal diameter, while the lower 56 cm had an internal diameter of 3.3 cm. The bed height when fluidized was 25 cm, thus giving a length diameter, L D, ratio of 7.6. An air driven vibrator was sometimes used to assist fluidization. A sintered glass frit at the bottom of the reactor supported the activated silicon particles end dispersed the gases as they entered the bed. Heating wire and fiberglass insulation were wrapped along the entire length of the reactor. Two Pyrex thermowells were placed vertically through the top of the reactor into the bed of activated silicon particies. One thermocouple provided feedback to the heater controller device, the other was attached to a digital thermometer.A reservoir, vented with nitrogen, was attached to the reactor near its base just above the glass frit to permit the intermittent addition of zinc promoters and or additional activated silicon to the bed. The junction of the reservoir and the reactor was normally kept closed by a valve. The reactor was connected to a condensing chamber by a side arm attached to the top of the expanded head section of the reactor. The condensing chamber was maintained at 630C to 780C with solid carbon dioxide and isopropanol. Condensed samples of the reaction product were withdrawn, usually hourly, into weighed, chilled flasks. Unreacted methylhalide and dimethyl ether were distilled off at 23 309C and the residue analyzed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography mass spectrometry.The reagent gases were conveyed from their commercial cylinders to the reactor through stainless steel tubing.All gases were passed through packed beds of anhydrous calcium sulfate obtained from W.A. Hammond and Co. under its trademark Drierite prior to entry into the reactor in order to remove traces of moisture. Of course, all flowmeters were calibrated with the appropriate gas volumetrically with a wet test meter and or gravimetrically by condensing and weighing metered quantities of liquified gas. For the experiments wherein methanol was added to the activated silicon particles along with dimethyl ether, weighed amounts of methanol were delivered by syringe pump to a heated 70 1000C section of the common inlet to the reactor and therein it was vaporized and mixed with the dimethyl ether before entering the bed of activated silicon particles.Example 1 Preparation Of Activated Silicon ParticlesThe reactor described above was charged with 200 g.ofo,147O,2OBmn 65 x 150 mesh technical grade silicon 98.4 Si , 0.35 Al, 0.55 Fe and 5.0 g of cement copper CuO 22 ,Cu2O 50.4 , CuO 18.8 and heated to 3000C with dry nitrogen as the fluidizing gas. Thereafter, nitrogen was discontinued and HC1 at 1.0 j min i.e., measured at 210C, 1 bar was admitted to the reactor for 1 hour.A 10 200C exotherm occurred during that time.Simultanenously, approximately eight percent of the silicon charged was converted to chlorosilane, principally trichlorosilane which were condensed in the refrigerated chamber. Upon the termination of HC1 flow, dry nitrogen was again admitted to the bed for one hour to desorb residual chlorosilanes and Si Cl surface species from the activated silicon particles. The bed temperature was usually increased to the reaction temperature 325 3600C during this desorption step. Existence of the Si X X C1, Br surface species on silicon surfaces following treatment of silicon with CuX or HX has been established through the experiments of Zubkov, et. al., Dokl. Akad.Nauk, SSR 159 3 , 599 1964 188 3 , 594 1969 andMiyamura, et. al., Surf. Sci. 72, 243 1978 . Example 2This example illustrates that activated silicon particles prepared as described in Example 1 react with methyl chloride to give methylchlorosilanes. Powdered ZnCO3 0.5 g was added to the activated silicon particles while they were under nitrogen fluidization at 3250C. TheZnCO3 was placed in the above mentioned reservoir attached to the base of the reactor and injected into the latter with a pulse of dry nitrogen. Thereafter, additional ZnCO3 0.2 g was injected hourly in the same manner. Methyl chloride at 0.8 mien was substituted for nitrogen as the fluidizing gas and the reaction continued for 8 hours. Gas chromatographic analysis of the hourly samples showed that steady state conditions in the bed were attained in 2 3 hours.The steady state parameters were 89.93 wt CH3 2SiC12, 4.58 wt CH3SiC13, 1.06 wt CH3 3SiCl, 1.11 wt CH3SiHC12 and a total of 3.32 wt of the methylchlorodisilanes and methylchlorosiloxanes shown below CH3 3Si Si CH3 2C1 CH3 3Si SiC13 Cl CH3 2Si SiC13 CH3 3Si Si CH3 3 CH3Cl2Si SiCl2CH3 CH3 2ClSi SiC12CH3 CH3 2ClSi Si CH3 2C1 CH3 3SiOSiC12CH3 CH3 2ClSiOSiCl3 Example 3 For Comparison Together, the three experiments in this example show that dimethyl ether does not react with activated silicon particles by itself, but needs the simultaneous presence of an organohalide to do so. a Silicon particles, activated with cement copper and HC1 as described in Example 1, were promoted with ZnCO3 as described in Example 2 and treated with 0.8 t min of dimethyl ether for 6 h at 3250 C. No silicon containing products were obtained. In fact, the hourly sample flasks contained only small amounts of elutriated silicon particles following the evaporation of the dimethyl ether. b When, instead of desorption with N2 at 3250C for 1 h the desorption of the Si Cl surface species was conducted at 2650C for 30 min , so as to retain more of the said Si Cl species on the silicon particles, treatment with a mixture of 90.6 g h of dimethyl ether and 34.84 g h of vaporized methanol at 2660C for one hr gave a product mixture containing 3 CH3 2Si OCH3 2, 3 CH3Si OCH3 3, 56 HSi OCH3 3, 23 Si OCH3 4 and 15 methoxydisiloxane and methylmethoxydisiloxanes.It is well known that HSi OCH3 3, and Si OCH3 4 are the principal products of the direct synthesis of methanol with activated silicon particles see, e.g., U.S. A 3,072,700 and 2,473,260 . Their formation persisted throughout the duration of the experiment.However, synthesis of the methylmethoxysilanes was not sustained beyond the first hour. c Reaction of the freshly activated and only partially desorbed silicon particles example 2 b with 89.7 gih.. of vaporized methanol for 5 hrs followed by 6 hrs with a mixture of 90.6 gih of dimethyl ether and 92.9 q h . of vaporized methanol did not result in methylmethoxy silane formation. All eleven hourly samples showedHSi OCH3 3, Si OCH3 4, and methoxydisiloxanes as the only products.Without being bound by theory, these results may be explained as follows Surface Si Cl moieties reacted with dimethyl ether equation 10 to produce methyl chloride EMI22.1 The latter reacted with the activated silicon partices to produce CH3 2SiC12 and CH3SiC13 as well as additional Si Cl surface species. The methylmethoxysilanes arose via equations 11 14 EMI22.2 Eventually, their formation was terminated due to the loss of CH3C1 from the bed. It is to replenish the Si Cl surface groups that CH3C1 is required in this direct synthesis.Example 4This example shows that the direct synthesis of siloxanes ensues from the use of CH3 2O and CH3C1 mixtures. The reaction was performed as described in Example 2 except that the feed gas contained 0.37 min cumin CH3 20 plus 0.54 t min CH3Cl. The volumetric ratio, CH3C1 CH3 2O, was 1.46 and the molar ratio, 1.44. Two cumulative, 3 h samples were collected. Gas chromatographic mass spectrometric analysis of each sample following distillation of the excess CH3 2O and CH3C1 revealed CH3 2SiHCl CH3 3SiCl CH3 2SiC12 CH3 2Si OCH3 Cl CH3 3SiOSi CH3 2C1 CH3 2SiO14 Cl CH3 2SiOSi CH3 2OCH3 CH3 3SiOSiC12CH3 C12CH3SiOSi CH3 2OCH3 CH3 3SiOSi CH3 2OSiC12CH3 CH3 3Si OSi CH3 2 2OSiC12CH3Note that compared with Example 2, no disilanes were detected and that many more siloxanes were formed. Total content of linear, cyclic and functionalized siloxanes was 8.09 wt . The direct synthesis of methylsiloxanes from dimethyl ether and methyl chloride was accomplished in a fluidized bed at atmospheric pressure.Example 5This Example shows that CH3Br and CH3 2O react with activated silicon to yield a higher content of siloxanes than was realized with CH3C1 and CH3 2O under analogous reaction conditions. a The reaction of Example 2 was repeated with 0.83 t min CH3Br over a 22 hour period. 591.34 g of mixed methylbromosilanes was obtained after distillation of excess methylbromide. The product contained 41.10 wt CH3 2SiBr2, 33.06 wt CH3SiBr3, 22.23 wt CH3 3SiBr, 0.57 wt S CH3 2SiHBr, 0.22 wt CH3SiHBr2 and 2.92 wt methylbromodisilanes. b Following the above reaction with methyl bromide, the feed gas was changed to 0.373 t min CH3 2O and 0.55 mien CH3Br. The volumetric ratio,CH3Br CH3 2O was 1.48 and the molar ratio 1.49. Reaction was continued for 7 h at 3250C. The product left after evaporation of excess CH3 2O and CH3Br was a viscous, pleasant smelling liquid, which did not fume in contact with moisture as did the mixed methylbromosilanes. Gas chromatographic mass spectrometric analysis revealed the presence of the following methylmethoxy silanes and linear and cyclic methylsiloxanes CH3 3SiOCH3 CH3 3SiOSi CH3 3 CH3 28i OCH3 2 CH3 3Si OSi CH3 2 nOCH3 n 1, 2, 3 and 4 CH3 3Si OSi CH3 2 nOSi CH3 3 n 1, 2, 3 and 4 CH3 2SiO n n 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7The total content of siloxanes in the product was 83.58 wt t. Less than 1t of CH3 2Si OCH3 2 was formed.
