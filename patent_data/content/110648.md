# Synchronization apparatus in redundant time division multiple access communication equipment.

## Abstract
The synchronisation between an active circuit 2a and a standby circuit 2b is carried out using a frequency divided signal TXSFTa from an active transmission frame timing sig nal TXFTa instead of using the transmission frame timing sig nal itself, and at times other than the output timing of the fre quency divided signal, a standby transmission frame counter 13b runs independently. Thus, failure of the active circuit is less likely to affect the timing of the standby circuit and switch ing between the active circuit and the standby circuit can be carried out smoothly.
