# A transparent switch array.

## Abstract
A transparent switch array 10 includes a flexible or pliant sheet 28 having a number of vertically ex tending conductive column elements 32 mounted in spaced apart parallel relationship with a rigid backplate 12 that includes a number of horizontally extending conductive row elements 16 so that the intersecting row and column elements, in effect, form a matrix of rectangular touch pressure activated switches 70 . A relatively thin, flat electrical cable 48 that is inter posed between two edge regions of the backplate 12 and the sheet 28 provides a portion of the peripheral backplate flexible sheet spacing, with thin adhesive strips 64 establishing the interelement spacing along the other two border regions. An array of small trans parent elastomeric dots or beads that are deposited on one surface of the pliant sheet 28 in effect out line the individual switch elements 70 and main tain the pliant sheet 28 in noncontacting, closely spaced orientation with the backplate 12 . Compressive U shaped spring clips 72 spaced along the periphery of the switch array 10 , maintain the components in proper position and ensure good electrical contact be tween the conductive row and column elements 16 and 32 and solderless connections between the electrical cable 48 and the conductive elements 16 and 32 of the backplate 12 and the flexible sheet 28 .
