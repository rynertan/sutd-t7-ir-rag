# Alkali metal ionization detector with in situ calibration capability.

## Abstract
A calibration filament 3 containing a sodium bearing compound is included in combination with the sensing fila ment 2 and ion collector plate 1 of a sodium ionization detector to permit periodic generation of sodium atoms for the in situ calibration of the detector. Typically, the detectors are monitored in a control room which is remote from a fast breeder reactor facility. The detectors require removal from the reactor facility for periodic maintenance and calibration. With the detector having in situ calibration capability, the efficient use of the detectors are significantly enhanced.
