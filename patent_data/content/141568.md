# Sealed lead acid battery.

## Abstract
The Invention envolves a sealed lead acid battery com prising a cell element having positive plates, negative plates and separators, and electrolyte retained within micropore of the cell element. The micropores of both the plates is substantially filled with the electrolyte, while the micropores of the separators are not completely filled with the electrolyte. The voids formed partialy in the micropores of the separators permit transport of the oxygen gas from the positive plates to the negative plates. Such a sealed lead acid battery has long service life, and excels in ability to Oâ‚‚ absorb gases and reproduce water during overcharging and to recover by charging after a long overdischarged state storage.
