## Description
The present invention relates to an optical rotary encoder and, more particularly, to an optical rotary encoder which allows easy alignment of a light receiving element and a fixed slit. An optical rotary encoder is already known. Figures 1 A to 1 D show an example of such an optical rotary encoder. Figure 1 A is a partial cutaway view, in which a fixed encoding plate 13 is fixed to a lower portion of a rotating encoding disk 12 fixed below a rotating shaft 11, and a light receiving element array 14 is fixed below the plate 13. A light emitting diode 15 fixed to a printed circuit board 16 is arranged above the rotating encoding disk 12. Figure 1 B is a plan view of the rotating encoding disk 12. Light transmitting portions slits and light shielding portions indicated by hatched portions are formed along the outer periphery of the rotating encoding disk 12 at equal intervals. Light emitting diodes 15a and 15b in Fig. 1 A , generally indicated by reference numeral 15 , emit light downward onto the light transmitting and light shielding portions. Figures 1 C and 1 D are plan views showing the fixed encoding plate 13 and the light receiving element array 14. The fixed encoding plate 13 derives an A phase signal and an For this reason, in the conventional encoder, the assembly and alignment are performed as shown in Figs. 2 A to 2 F . Note that Figs. 2 A , 2 C , and 2 E are partial plan views of the encoder shown in Figs. 1 A to 1 D , and Figs. 2 B , 2 D , and 2 F are sectional views corresponding to those plan views. Referring to Figs. 2 A and 2 B , the fixed encoding plate 13 is mounted on a fixing base 17 with a groove 17a. Next, referring to Figs. 2 C and 2 D , the light receiving element array 14 is inserted in the groove 17a, and is mounted on the fixing base 17. In this case, the patterns of the fixed encoding plate and the light receiving element array are aligned accurately using a microscope. Referring to Figs. 2 E and 2 F , the fixing base 17 is mounted on a flange 18, the patterns of the rotating encoding disk 12 and the fixed encoding plate 13 are aligned to be concentrical with each other, and then the fixing base 17 is fixed to the flange 18 by screws. Since the above components must be moved in X and Y directions, i.e., two directions, so as to be aligned, alignment of the light receiving element array and the fixed encoding plate, and that of the fixing base and the flange are cumbersome and the number of assembling steps of the encoder is undesirably increased. EP A 0 100 828 describes an incremental rotary encoder having a slotted housing attached to the frame of a machine which supports a rotatable shaft to which the encoder is to be mounted. Also attached to the housing is a stationary mask defining slits which are aligned with passages in the housing. The mask has an accurately dimensioned aperture for locating it, and thus the housing, on a bearing provided on the rotatable shaft. An array of light sources and detectors are mounted on opposite sides of the housing aligned with passages in the housing and the slits in the mask. A rotating encoding disk is then connected to the shaft, the disk being mounted in the slotted housing so that its interdigitated opaque and transparent portions align with the slits of the mask and thus with the light sources and light detectors. EP A 0 100 819 describes an optical shaft encoder in which a mounting plate is secured to a housing by a latch, at a predetermined distance from the housing. A rotatable encoder disk which has a conical shaped hub is placed in an aperture defined by the housing. The assembly is pushed on to a motor shaft, such that the disk is secured to the shaft. A mounting plate is then attached to a motor case and the housing rotated. This moves the housing into an abutting relationship with the plate and therefore spaces the housing a predetermined distance from the disk which is thus both axially and radially positioned. EP A 0 054 660 describes an angle measuring device including a graduated disk mounted on a drive shaft which is to be aligned with a stator mounted on the attachment surface of an external drive unit. In order to align the stator properly with respect to the drive shaft and the graduated disk, a centring collar is provided on the attachment surface, concentric with the drive shaft. The centring collar interacts with at least two alignment surfaces defined by the stator. These alignment surfaces are positioned to define the desired orientation of the stator with respect to the drive shaft. DE C 2 848 612 discloses a pulse generator which has a pulse disk rotatably mounted, within a casing, on a shaft which is itself supported by the casing. The casing is also provided with a light transmitting and a light receiving module. Bearing surfaces on either side of the disk bear against bearing surfaces provided on the shaft and serve to support and accurately centre the pulse disk. It is an object of the present invention to provide an encoder which allows easy alignment of an encoder, and reduces the number of assembling steps. According to the present invention, there is provided an optical rotary encoder for detecting a rotating position of a rotating shaft by connecting and disconnecting an optical path formed by a light emitting element and an opposing light receiving element upon rotation of the rotating shaft, characterized by comprising a fixing base having a cylinder concentrical with an axis of the rotating shaft, and fixed to a flange a light receiving element plate having a hole of a size enough to be engaged with the cylinder of the fixing base and be rotatable relative thereto during assembly, and a light receiving element precisely aligned from the center of the hole in the radial direction thereof and a fixed encoding plate, in which an encoding portion is formed so that given light is radiated on the light receiving element of the light receiving element plate, which is fixed to the fixing base so as to be adjacent to the light receiving element plate at a predetermined distance therefrom. When the light receiving element plate with the above arrangement is engaged with the cylinder of the fixing base, the light receiving element is precisely aligned with the axis in the radial direction. Furthermore, when the fixed encoding plate is fixed to the fixing base and the light receiving element plate is rotated to be adjusted in its circumferential direction, the encoding portion of the fixed encoding plate can be easily aligned with the light receiving element of the light receiving element plate, and after this alignment, the fixed encoding plate and the light receiving element plate are fixed to the fixing base. The fixing base with the thus aligned fixed encoding plate and light receiving element plate is fixed to the flange. The fixed encoding plate is fixed to the fixing base so as to be aligned with the encoding portion of the rotating encoding disk using a light transmitting ring formed in the fixed encoding plate. Furthermore, according to the present invention, there is provided a method for assembling an optical rotary encoder which detects a rotating position of a rotating shaft by connecting and disconnecting an optical path formed by a light emitting element and an opposing light receiving element upon rotation of the rotating shaft, and which comprises a fixing base having a cylinder concentrical with an axis of the rotating shaft, and fixed to a flange a light receiving element plate having a hole of a size enough to be engaged with the cylinder of the fixing base and be rotatable relative therein during assembly, and a light receiving element precisely aligned from the center of the hole in the radial direction thereof and a fixed encoding plate, in which an encoding portion is formed so that given light is radiated on the light receiving element of the light receiving element plate, which is fixed to the fixing base so as to be adjacent to the light receiving element plate at a predetermined distance therefrom, characterized by comprising a the step of fitting a cylinder step of the fixing base in the hole of the light receiving element plate b the step of aligning the fixed encoding plate with a supporting portion of the fixing base c the step of centering the fixed encoding plate d the step of rotating the light receiving element plate so as to align the light receiving element with the fixed encoding plate while the light receiving element plate is kept inserted in the cylinder step of the fixing base e fixing the light receiving element plate and the fixed encoding plate to the fixing base and f engaging the fixing base with the fixed encoding plate and light receiving element plate, which are aligned and fixed in the above steps, with an engaging portion of the flange. Figure 3 shows assembly of an optical rotary encoder according to an embodiment of the present invention. Figure 3 A is a sectional view of a light receiving element plate 24 and a fixed encoding plate 23 mounted on a fixing base 27. Figure 3 A shows a state when the fixed encoding plate 23 is fixed using a jig 40, a non metallic spacer 41, a washer 42, and a screw 43. Figure 3 B is a plan view of Fig. 3 A . The fixed encoding plate 23 has the same pattern for deriving A , In assembly of the encoder according to the present invention, the above components are prepared in advance, which must satisfy the following machining conditions. The cylinder step 27b of the fixing base 27, with which the light receiving element plate 24 is engaged, must be formed into a precise concentrical circle with respect to the center O O of the rotating shaft. In this case, however, the step 27b can be easily formed by cylinder machining using a lathe or the like. The hole of the light receiving element plate 24 is machined to be engaged with the outer diameter of the cylinder step 27b of the fixing base 27. In this case, a clearance of several micrometers must be formed to allow pivotal movement of the light receiving element plate 24 when it is inserted in the cylinder step 27b of the fixing base. However, the radial position of the light receiving element array with respect to the central axis O O must not be adversely influenced. More specifically, this allows easy alignment of the radial position of the light receiving element array with a high precision by simply engaging the light receiving element plate with the cylinder step of the fixing base. Since the fixed encoding plate 23 is made of glass, machining precision of the hole is limited to at most about 0.1 mm. However, the ring shaped transparent portion 23 acting as the centering track is formed to be accurately concentrical with the axial center. A method of assembling the encoder shown in Fig. 3 will now be described. As is clearly understood from the above descriptions, when the light receiving element plate is mounted on the fixing base, the light receiving element array can be accurately, uniformly, and quickly aligned in the radial direction. Thus, alignment of the pattern of the fixed encoding plate and the light receiving element array need only be performed in the circumferential rotating direction. The fixed encoding plate is aligned with the slit portion of the rotating encoding disk when it is mounted on the fixing base. Therefore, the encoder can be assembled only by mounting the fixing base with the light receiving element plate and the fixed encoding plate on the flange. In the above embodiment, the incremental type optical rotary encoder has been described, but the present invention can be applied to an absolute type optical rotary encoder. Figures 4 A to 4 C partially show an absolute type optical rotary encoder according to an embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 4 A is a plan view of a rotating encoding disk 112, Fig. 4 B is a plan view corresponding to Fig. 3 B , and Fig. 4 C is a plan view corresponding to Fig. 3 C . In this embodiment, 5 annular slits are formed in the rotating encoding disk 112, which enables absolute position detection of 5 bits, i.e., 2⁵ 1 0 to 32 per rotation. Referring to Fig. 4 B , a light transmitting ring 123a and pattern portions 130a to 130e for forming an absolute phase corresponding to the 5 annular slits of the rotating encoding plate 112 are formed in a fixed encoding plate 123 placed on a supporting portion 127a of a fixing base 127. Other portions of the plate 123 are covered with a black mask as indicated by hatching. Referring to Fig. 4 C , a light receiving element array 114 corresponding to the pattern portions 130a to 130e of the fixed encoding plate 13 is arranged on a light receiving element plate 124, and is aligned precisely from the center of the rotating shaft in the radial direction just as in Fig. 3 C . The light receiving element plate 124 comprises a glass epoxy plate having a hole engaged with a step 127b of a cylinder portion of the fixing base 127 just as in Fig. 3 D . As can be seen from the above description, the encoder shown in Figs. 4 A to 4 C is substantially the same as the incremental type encoder shown in Fig. 3 A to 3 D except for the slit of the rotating encoding plate 112, the pattern portions 130a to 130e of the fixed encoding plate 123, and the light receiving element array 114 of the light receiving element array 124. Therefore, it can be manufactured and assembled in the same manner as the above mentioned incremental type encoder. According to the present invention as described above, alignment becomes easy, and the number of assembling steps can be decreased. An optical rotary encoder of the present invention can be applied to precise positional detection of working machines.
