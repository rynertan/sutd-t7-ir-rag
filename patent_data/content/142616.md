# Method and apparatus for editing and for replay of digital audio data recorded on a magnetic tape.

## Abstract
In producing an edited tape 31 the lead in material up to a first edit point is separated from the lead out material run ning from a second edit point by a space containing unwanted material and accommodating the actual or notional splice. The unwanted material ensures correct operation of error protection for all of the wanted material on replay. The first and second edit points are marked by codes placed on the tape 31 by a code processor 43 and supplementary head 42 . During replay the digital data recovered from the tape by a head 32 is entered into a random access buffer store 34 under control of a write address generator 38 and read out to output electronics 37 under control of a read address generator 39 running at the audio sampling rate. The write address generator 38 normally runs at a rate corresponding tape speed but the code processor detects the codes for first and second edit points and a control unit 51 stops the write address generator 38 between such points so as to discard the unwanted material. The store is then replenished by speeding up the tape by a comparator 40 and speed control unit 10 in an arrangement which preserves a constant rela tionship between the read and write addresses, i.e. a constant degree of filling of the memory 34 .
