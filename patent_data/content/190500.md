# INSULATING ELECTRICAL CONDUCTOR

## Abstract
Providing an insulation layer upon electrical conductor 26 by passing the conductor with clearance towards and through an outlet orifice 30 of a die insert 24 as the conductor approaches a die orifice 32 . The degree of concentricity of the conductor within the insulation layer is monitored after extrusion and an eccentrically positioned conductor is moved towards a concentric location by moving the conductor, at a position upstream of the outlet orifice of the die insert, laterally of the feedpath. This movement effects a change in approach of the conductor to the outlet orifice and influences a change in the angle of departure from the outlet orifice thereby altering the lateral position of the conductor within the die orifice.
