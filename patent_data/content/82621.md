# Implantable bone prosthesis.

## Abstract
A flexible, bone prosthesis is disclosed that comprises demineralized bone powder contained within a medical grade porous flexible casing made from polymeric fibers or a microporous membrane. The pores of the casing are smaller than the particle size of the bone powder but large enough to permit ingress of body cells associated with bone formation.
