# Improved drilling fluids based on sulfonated elastomeric polymers.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to sulfonated elastomeric polymers which are copolymers of isoprene and sodium styrene sulfonate or teropolymers of isoprene, styrene and sodium styrene sulfonate wherein these sulfonated polym ers function as viscosification agents when added to oil based drilling muds which are the fluids used to maintain pressure, cool drill bits and lift cuttings from the holes in the drilling operation for oil and gas wells. The sulfonated and elastomeric polymers have 5 to 100 meq. of sulfonate groups per 1000 grams of the sulfonated elastomeric polymer, wherein the sulfonated groups are neutralized with a metallic cation or an amine or ammonium counterion. A polar cosolvent can optionally be added to the mixture of oil drilling mud and sulfonated elastomeric polymer, wherein the polar cosolvent increases the solubility of the sulfonated elastomeric polymer in the oil drilling mud by decreasing the strong ionic interactions between the sulfonate groups of the sulfonated polymer.
