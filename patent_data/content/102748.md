# Parenteral solution administration set.

## Abstract
The administration set has a porous hydrophilic filter member 28 , which can control the liquid level and prevent the passage of gas downwardly through the set, located adjacent the lower end of a drip chamber 20 to control flow out of the lower end and to be submerged in liquid held in the drip chamber during operation thereof. The set is thereby usable with parenteral solution pumps. The drip chamber may contain an elongated member 48 projecting inwardly of the lower end of the chamber and carrying indicia along its length to indicate liquid volume in the chamber as a function of liquid level.
