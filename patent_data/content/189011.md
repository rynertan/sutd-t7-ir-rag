# Telescopic guide, especially for transmittance of torque.

## Abstract
A telescopic guide, especially for transmittance of tor que in alternating directions and of the type which com prises a telescopic shaft 1 having at least three axial guide grooves 4 6 distributed round the telescopic shaft, an outer telescopic sleeve 2 having inner axial counter grooves 12 provided round the sleeve substantially like the guide grooves 4 6 of the telescopic shaft 1 , and sev eral transmittance elements provided between the guide grooves 4 6 of the telescopic shaft and the counter grooves 12 of the telescope sleeve 2 . The transmittance elements preferably are rows of balls, in which at least one such row has balls of a relatively elastic material, where as the other rows comprise balls of a material which is hard in relation to said elastic material. The balls of elastic material may have a slightly larger dimension than the grooves 4 of the telescope shaft and the counter grooves 12 of the telescopic sleeve 2 whereas the balls of harder material may have a slightly less dimension than the equivalent grooves 5, 6 and counter grooves re spectively. Preferably the grooves 5, 6 of the telescopic shaft 1 for the hard balls are angularly displaced in rel ation to the equivalent counter grooves of the telescopic sleeve 2 such that the points of contact for two adjacent hard balls with the telescopic shaft 1 and the telescopic sleeve 2 are located on common mutually parallel planes. The telescopic guide may comprise three rows of transmitt ance elements, in which one row has elastic balls, and four rows of transmittance elements, in which two such adjacent rows comprise elastic balls.
