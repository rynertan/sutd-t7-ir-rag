# CORDLESS INTELLIGENT MOUSE

## Abstract
A cordless mouse pointing device 16 communicates to a base station receiver 222 across free space. An infrared beam is modulated by a serial data output 188 containing information specifying the displacement and status of the mouse pointing device 16 . The mouse pointing device 46 is battery operated, but may optionally be connected to the base station with a cord 40 . The cord 40 communicates data between the mouse 16 and the base station 12 as well as provides power from the base station 12 to recharge the batteries 86 of the mouse 16 and to power the mouse 16 . A low voltage sensing device 48 in the mouse 16 determines if the batteries 86 are nearly exhausted, this information being transmitted to the base station 12 to warn a human user. If the mouse pointing device 16 is not used and its buttons 28, 30 are not pushed for a predetermined period of time, the mouse 16 switches off many of its active circuits to preserve battery power i.e., it goes to sleep . Before going to sleep, the mouse 16 transmits a sleep notification packet 188 to the base station 12 to inform the user that the mouse 16 has gone to sleep and must be awakened again i.e., by depressing one of the mouse pointing device buttons 28, 30 before it can again be used.
