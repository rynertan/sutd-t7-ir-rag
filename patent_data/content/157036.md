# SERIAL CHIP SCAN

## Abstract
Disclosed is a scan apparatus 4 which provides an interface and control signals between a secondary com puter 1 and data locations in a host computer 2 . The scan apparatus 4 functions independently of the normal opera tion of the host computer 2 . Scan out is performed trans parently to the operation of the host computer 2 . The host computer 2 is constructed using circuits on semiconductor chips 7 1. 7 Y . The semiconductor chips 7 1, 7 Y are organized in blocks 3 1 . Chips within each block 3 1 include scan apparatus 4 which controls the scan opera tions in connection with that chip. The scan apparatus in each chip is connected through two I O pins to a clock lines and to a bidirectional scan data line. The scan apparatus on each chip includes a multimode sequencer so that each chip in each block can be independently performing scan sequences. The block scan apparatus and the secondary computer perform the functions of requesting a scan sequence for transmitting the scan data.
