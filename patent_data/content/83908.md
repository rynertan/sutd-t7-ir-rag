# Synchronous rotating assemblies for luminous scenographies with central part supporting four turning caps in orthogonal position.

## Abstract
A rotating assembly is employed fitted with spotlights for luminous dynamic scenographies foreseen with a central cylindrical envelope 1 on a rotation shaft 9 and hemisferic bottom 2 , externally bearing a system of four analogous caps on rotation shafts with a horizontal orthogonal scheme turning in synchronism with its movement. The synchronism is possible thanks to a cross gear system, each one supported by one of the said shafts and engaged on the top by an overlying conical gear 16 wich, through a Cardan trasmission 13 , is moved by the central supporting shaft. The conical gear system is fitted in a frame inside the box and each shaft turns on a pair of bushes fitted on the frame and on the envelope.

## Description
Synchronous rotating assemblies for luminous scenographies with central part supporting four turning caps in orthogonal position .The invention refers to a device for luminous scenographies driven by a setoof spotlights with differently coloured ray pencils which settled in components with different movements generate changing projection effects and differently interfering one with another a nd animating the room.The contrivance is differentlyssupport on a plane or on a wall on a protection box of the driving organ and permits particular emtL oys for night club rooms. In particular it permits to increase the fantasmagorical animation effect of the room in comparison with the present devices with a single supporting and rotating part of spotlights,The turning assembly is supported on a rotation shaft centrally bearing, on a longitudinal axle, a part with cilindrical envelope and hemispheric bottom which is exeternally supporting a system of four analogous caps on shafts at orthogonal horizontal scheme turning in syncronism withthe rotation movement of the central supporting movement of the central supporting part.The said 5 aft is driven by the motor assembly fitted in the protection box.The envelope components can be manufactured in light plate or other stiff material and are foreseen with projecting and integral spotlights on the outer continuous walls of the envelopes, thus generating a sight perception of assembly connected to independent rotating components. The mation synchronism of the five assembly components is carried out by a gear cross system, each of which integrally brought by one of the above shafts and one the top engaged by an overlying conical gear which, through a Cardan transmission, is driven by the rotation shaft of the central support. The system of the five conical gears is fitted in a box inside the frame and each shaft is turning on a pair of bushes properly fitted on the frame composing the box and the envelope.A not limiting forr, of execution is illustrated by the drawings ofTable 1 where Fig. 1 is the view of the only rotating assembly wwth out support and box including the driving motor. The figure shows two of the moving caps and the hemisferic bottom analogous to the ones of the central part, all equipped with spotlights in position.Fig. 2 is the partial longitudinal section of the rotating assembly on the top of which the f1 ged box can be seen positioning She motor assembly forthe supporting shaft drive which, through the Cardan trasmission, is rotating in synchronism the system of the four hemispheric caps. The orthogonal system of shafts turning on the pair of bushes foreseen on the frame wall and on the envelope can be noted too. The rotation assembly employs the central part with upper cylindrical component 1 and lower end with hemispherical form 2 analogous to the outside caps 3, 4, 5 and 6. The central part shows above the preclusion circular wall 7 with central bore 8 for setting the ro tation shaft 9. driven by the motor assembly 10 contained in box 11 fitted with side flanges 12 for fixing on the plane or on the ceiling. The rotation shaft 9, through Cardan joint 13 fitted on wall 14, through shaft 15, trasmits the motion to conical gear 18 engaging the concial gear assembly 17, 18, 19 and 20 for turning shafts 21,22, 23 and 24. Each of the said shafts is turning on a pair of bearing 25 on the frame wall 26 and 27 on the envelope. The caps can be fitted on the central part by means of screw com ponents 28 which can be set in a corresponding Spiral cavity 29 of the shaft through the correspondence bore foreseen on the cap.On the moving four caps and on the stationary one, spotlights are foreseen with emerging collars 30 of the projectors. In a version, the spotlights are foreseen in series connection and equipped with sight guage to enable a prompt localization of the light source to restore in case of troubles In practice, the materials, the spotlights, the co..ec. on system the motor elements and those of the transmission, as well as every thing else in order may be differently carried out.
