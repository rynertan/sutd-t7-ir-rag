# Method and apparatus for producing an indentation in a tubular body.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for production of couplings for joining together sections of metal tubing, the couplings being of the type comprising sockets having e.g. an annular recess carrying a filler metal, whereby the filler metal comprises a plastic composition which is applied under pressure to a selected internal area of a section of deformable tubing 28 thereby to form an indentation containing a deposit of plastic composition.
