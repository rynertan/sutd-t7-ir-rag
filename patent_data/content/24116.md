# Mobile high frequency vibrator system.

## Abstract
A carrier mounted seismic vibrator system that is primar ily adapted for generation of high force, high frequency seismic energy into an earth medium. The apparatus includes first and second vibrators 12F and R as supported by first and second lift systems 28F and R disposed in tandem juxtaposi tion generally centrally in said vehicle 10 , and the lift sys tems 28F and R are designed to maintain equal hold down force on the vibrator coupling baseplates 32F and R without exceeding the weight of the carrier vehicle. The juxtaposed vibrators are then energized in synchronised relationship to propagate increased amounts of higher frequency seismic energy into an earth medium.
