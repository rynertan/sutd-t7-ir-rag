# COSMETIC PENCIL

## Abstract
A cosmetic pencil for use in the topical application of eye shadow, eye liner, lipstick, or the like. The pencil comprises an outer sheath or barrel and an inner core of a cosmetic compo sition. The barrel is composed of polyethylene and contains from 5 to 20 by weight of hydrogenated castor oil. The cos metic pencil can be readily sharpened through use of a con ventional pencil sharpener, and the addition of the hydrogenat ed castor oil provides the barrel with increased toughness, easier sharpening characteristics, as well as substantially re ducing stress cracking of the barrel at elevated temperatures.
