# Ballet toe shoe and process of manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
A ballet dancer s toe dancing ballet shoe 10 is designed and manufactured more simply than conventional ballet toe shoes. A sole supporting shank 20 of the toe shoe has a tip flat 40 at the front thereof which may be folded up to define the front panel of the complete ballet toe shoe. The shank is applied to a male mold member 80 which is inserted into a female mold member cavity 70, 72 and resin is inserted into the space between the mold members for defining a toe box support frame 50 in which the inserted portion of the shank 20 and tip flat 40 are embedded. The shank is comprised of a leather like material. The completed combination of the shank and toe box support frame are removed from the mold members. A ballet toe shoe upper 14 is fastened to the shank and over the exterior and in the interior, as well, of the toe box support frame 50. The space between the mold mem bers is greatest toward the interior of the cavity 72 and gradually diminishes toward the exterior of the cavity, thickening and giving greater strength to the front of the toe shoe 60 than to the rear portion of the toe box 62. The shank and resin combination eliminates intricate processes and skilled labor now required to manufacture toe shoes. At the same time, the desired properties of varying degrees of stiffness of the shoe upper and of proper support of the dancer s foot are maintained.
