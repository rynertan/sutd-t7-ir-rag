# Current source circuit arrangement.

## Abstract
Of a first and a second PNP transistor T₁ T₂ having commoned base electrodes, the emitters are connected through resistors R₁ R₂ to the positive supply voltage termi nal 2 . The collector lead of the first transistor T₁ includes a current source 3 , which supplies a current which is repro duced at the output terminal 4 . The commoned base elec trodes are driven by a third transistor T₅ connected as an emitter follower, its emitter lead including a current source 5 . The base of the third transistor T₅ is connected through a resistor R₅ to the positive supply voltage terminal 2 as a result of which supply voltage variations appear also at the commoned bases of the first and second transistors T₁ T₂ so that the output current at the output terminal 4 is substan tially independent of supply voltage variations. A differential amplifier comprising fourth and fifth transistors T₆ T₇ , in which the base of the fourth transistor T₆ is connected to the collector of the first transistor T₁ and the base of the fifth transistor T₇ is connected to a reference voltage V
