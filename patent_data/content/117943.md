# Method of manufacturing a communication cable.

## Abstract
A cable comprises a central electrically insulating com posite string, including a relatively hard strength member filament 8 with a relatively soft layer 9 thereon. Four, in the case of a quad, electrical or optical conductors 10 are at least partially embedded in the softer layer 9 and may abut the filament 9 . A polyethylene sheath 11 is extruded over the string. The quad may be made by pressing the conduc tors against the outer periphery of the string whereby to deform it without heating it, and may involve the use of a die arrangement which ensures the desired spacing and configuration of the conductors relative to one another, necessary for high quality quads of electrical conductors in order to have low crosstalk, is obtained. The cable construction, which facilitates miniature quad manu facture, is such that cable can be manufactured with a minimum of process stages at high throughput speeds.
