## Description
This invention relates to a video signal processing apparatus capable of removing noise effectively without deteriorating the picture quality for use in a video tape recorder VTR or the like. Recently, in generally used consumer VTR sets, apparatus for removing low level noise of high frequency band signal and noise removing apparatus utilizing the line correlation are used to remove noises mixed in the reproduced signals. The noise removing apparatus for high frequency band which has been widely used is described below. Fig. 1 a is its block diagram, in which numeral 12 is an input terminal of reproduced and demodulated luminance signal, 13 is a high pass filter, 14 is a limiter, 15 is a subtractor, and 16 is an output terminal of the signal with reduced noise. The operation of the noise removing circuit thus composed is as follows. The high pass filter 13 has a frequency characteristic as indicated by solid line in Fig. 1 b , for example, when the horizontal frequency f In a consumer VTR, meanwhile, since the S N ratio is still insufficient by the noise removing apparatus for high band as shown in Fig. 1 alone, a noise removing apparatus utilizing the line correlation is used at the same time. Referring further to the drawing, the conventional noise removing apparatus utilizing the line correlation is described. Fig. 3 a is a schematic structural drawing of the conventional noise removing apparatus utilizing the line correlation, in which numeral 1 is an input terminal of reproduced FM luminance signal, 4 is a glass delay line for delaying the FM signal by 1H, 5 and 6 are demodulators for frequency demodulation, 7 is a subtractor for obtaining the difference between the demodulated luminance signal and the 1H delayed luminance signal, 8 is an attenuator for attenuating the output signal of the subtractor 7 to about 1 2, 9 is a limiter for limiting the amplitude of signal, 10 is an adder for adding the output signal of demodulator 5 and output signal of limiter 9, and 11 is an output terminal of signal. An example of such noise removing apparatus is disclosed in US A 4 302 768. The operation of thus composed noise removing apparatus utilizing the line correlation is as follows. In Fig. 3, the line from the input terminal to limiter 9 has the so called C shaped comb line filter characteristic with respect to the demodulated signals, and when the vertical frequency f Nevertheless, since thus composed conventional noise removing apparatus for high band and noise removing apparatus utilizing the line correlation are composed of analog circuits, many parts are required to make up circuits, and the structure of the VTR is much complicated. Besides, since the operation of the limiter depends on the nonlinear characteristic of semiconductor, it is difficult to realize a desired characteristic, and if the input signal amplitude is large, the output amplitude of the limiter does not become 0, so that the resolution of the picture may be deteriorated more or less. Still, in the noise removing apparatus utilizing the line correlation, since the 1H delay is effected in the form of FM signal by using glass delay line, two demodulators are required, and yet the noise removing effect may not be exhibited sufficiently due to the instability of frequency characteristic of the glass delay line or inaccuracy of delay time. It was also difficult to reduce the size of the apparatus. Further prior art is described in US 3,333,055. In the apparatus described in that document the incoming television signal is divided by way of filters into a plurality of frequency bands. At least one of the higher frequency bands is applied to a threshold device which is designed to inhibit any signal below a predetermined amplitude and pass signals above that amplitude. The television signal is then recombined, and as a result of the action of the threshold devices the noise in the signal, in the horizontal dimension, is reduced. While the devices described above are analog processing circuit, it is also known to process television signals digitally. This is shown for instances in the N.H.K Laboratories Note, No. 263, August 1981 pages 1, 3 9 in an article A Universal Digital Video Processor by K. Murakami and K. Enami. The processor described includes a device for reducing the noise in one screen dimension of the television signal. This invention is intended to solve the above discussed problems in the prior art, and is further intended to present a video signal processing apparatus capable of obtaining an excellent noise removing effect without deteriorating the signal, while simplifying the structure of the apparatus and reducing the manufacturing cost. A video signal processing apparatus of this invention comprises Since all of the components necessary to implement such a circuit are composed of digital circuits, they may be realized as a one chip semiconductor device, so that the apparatus may be simplified, be adjustment free and lowered in cost. Moreover, since processing is effected in the form of digital signal, the input output characteristics of the nonlinear processing means can be freely set. Therefore, by determining these characteristics in a way to suppress frequency components, of the input luminance signal passing through the filter with a small amplitude, the noise can be reduced without deteriorating the signal quality. Furthermore, in a range where the input signal amplitude of the nonlinear processing circuit is larger than a specified level, by determining the nonlinear input output characteristics in such a way as to emphasize the frequency component passing through the filters, the picture can be clarified without emphasizing the noise. Still more, by determining the nonlinear input output characteristics so as to suppress the frequency component passing through the filters when the input signal is smaller than a specified level and to emphasize when the range of the input signal amplitude is otherwise, the noise can be suppressed while the signal picture can be clarified. In these nonlinear processing circuits, any nonlinear input output characteristic can be easily realized, for example, by using ROM. Or, by designing the nonlinear processing circuit so that to select any desired one of plural kinds of input output characteristics, the noise reduction extent and the picture resoltuation can be freely adjusted depending on the nature of the picutre, S N ratio or the taste of the user. Furthermore, the filters may be designed to remove noise in the medium range which is likely to have the greatest visual impact. The filter which relates to the vertical frequency, by using memory to delay the signal by one horizontal scanning period, overcomes many defects of the glass delay line as compared with the conventional noise removing apparatus utilizing the line correlation by glass delay line, and an excellent noise removing effect may be obtained, and the demodulator is required only in one line. The invention defined above may divide the horizontal and vertical two dimensional frequency regions into four bands, the signals in which are individually nonlinearly processed and synthesized. In this invention since the noise uniformly distributed in all bands is divided into small section by the frequencies and are led into the nonlinear processing circuit, the noise and signal can be separated smoothly in each nonlinear processing circuit, and it is possible to suppress only the noise without deteriorating delicate luminance changes. Furthermore, when noise is superposed on the signal, by separately nonlinearly processing the frequency band including the signal spectrum and the other frequency band, a beautiful picture can be obtained by effectively removing the overlaying noise. And optimum nonlinear characteristics may be determined depending on the signal of the individual divided frequency bands, noise property, and visual characteristics, and an excellent noise removing effect can be obtained by keeping the deterioration of visual picture quality to a minimum. At this time, by utilizing the signal delayed for one horizontal scanning period obtained at the time of making up a filter, the dropout may be compensated. Since this dropout compensation function is to drop out in the form of digital signal after demodulating the reproduced FM signal, the noise occurring due to the discontinuation at the changing point of the phase of FM signal as experienced conventional does not take place. Or a dropout extending over a long period exceeding 1H may be smoothly compensated because the data is delayed in the form of digital signal, without deterioration of the picture quality due to decrease of amplitude or band as experienced conventionally. Fig. 4 is a circuit block diagram of a first video signal processing apparatus which is described to aid understanding of this invention, in which numeral 117 is an input terminal of luminance signal which has been digitized after being reproduced from the VTR and frequency demodulated, and 118 is a filter. This filter 118 is composed of a delay circuit 119 with delay time D, an arithmetic circuit 120, and a coefficient circuit 121. Numeral 122 is a nonlinear processing circuit for nonlinearly processing the output signal from the filter 118, 123 is an adder for adding the output signal of the nonlinear processing circuit 122 and the input luminance signal, and 124 is an output terminal for delivering the processed signal. Its operation is as follows. First, the basic operation of this circuit will be described. The frequency characteristic of the filter 118 is a high band passing type performance as shown in Fig. 5 when, for example, the delay time D is about 14 nsec, and the higher band portion of the luminance signal fed into the input terminal 117 is allowed to pass and supplied into the nonlinear processing circuit 122. Supposing the input output characteristic of the nonlinear processing circuit 122 to be as indicated by solid line C in Fig. 6 a , the signal fed to the input terminal 117 appears directly at the output terminal 124 in Fig. 4, and the frequency characteristic of the line from the input terminal 117 to the output terminal 124 becomes as shown by solid line Q in Fig. 6 b . On the other hand, when the input output characteristic of the nonlinear processing circuit 122 is as indicated by solid line A in Fig. 6 a . the frequency characteristic of the apparatus becomes as shown by solid line O in Fig. 6 b , which is a low band passing type characteristic. To the contrary, when the input output characteristic of the nonlinear processing circuit 122 is as shown by solid line E in Fig. 6 a , the frequency characteristic of the apparatus will emphasize the high band as indicated by solid line S in Fig. 6 b . Similarly, when the input output characteristic is as shown by solid lines B and D in Fig. 6 a , the frequency characteristic of the apparatus becomes as shown by solid lines P and R in Fig. 6 b . This is the basic operation of this circuit. Supposing now that a reproduced luminance signal containing noise is fed into the input terminal 117, the high band component is extracted by the filter 118, and fed into the nonlinear processing circuit 122. Here, generally, since the luminance signal is mostly composed of low frequency components, the extracted high band components with a small amplitude may be almost regarded as the noise. Accordingly, when the input output characteristic of the nonlinear processing circuit 122 is determined as shown in Fig. 7 a , the frequency characteristic of the apparatus becomes as shown by solid line O in Fig. 6 if the high band component obtained by the filter 118 in Fig. 4 is low in level and may be regarded as noise, so that the noise in the high band may be suppressed. Whereas if the high band component obtained by the filter 118 is large and may be regarded as signal, the frequency characteristic of the device becomes as shown by solid line Q in Fig. 6 b , so that the signal may not be deteriorated. However, in the nonlinear characteristic in Fig. 7 a , since the output does not become 0 if the input is sufficiently large, the resolution may be deteriorated more or less. Accordingly, it is possible to modify the nonlinear characteristic as shown in Fig. 7 b . As a result, the resolution of the signal will never be deteriorated. However, in this characteristic, since it is discontinuous in the threshold area, an unnatural impedance may be caused in this discontinuous part depending on the threshold level. In this case, as shown in Fig. 7 c , it can be improved by setting up a characteristic free of discontinuous point. In this way, by properly setting the nonlinear characteristic, the noise can be suppressed without deteriorating the signal. On the other hand, it is also possible to set the nonlinear input output characteristic as shown in Fig. 7 d . In this case, when the signal amplitude passing through the filter 118 is large and may be regarded as signal, the frequency characteristic of the device emphasizes the high band as indicated by solid line S in Fig. 6 b . Or, when the amplitude of the signal passing through the filter 118 is small and it may be regarded as noise, the frequency characteristic of the device becomes as indicated by solid line Q in Fig. 6 b , so that the noise may not be emphasized. Thus, without emphasizing the noise, the resolution of the picture can be enhanced. Or when a nonlinear characteristic as shown in Fig. 7 e is used, the resolution of the picture can be further enhanced even in a signal with a relatively small amplitude. Or, it may be also possible to determine the nonlinear characteristic as shown in Fig. 7 f . In this case, as estimated from the explanation above, the noise is suppressed by the frequency characteristic of solid line O in Fig. 6 b , while the signal is emphasized in the high band by the characteristic of solid line S in Fig. 6 b . Meanwhile, concerning the structure of the nonlinear processing circuit 122 having various nonlinear input output characteristics as shown in Fig. 7, various compositions may be considered by proper combination of logic circuits depending on the individual characteristics, and by using read only memories hereinafter referred to ROM , various nonlinear characteristics may be realized very easily. That is, using the input signal to the nonlinear processing circuit 122 as the address, a desired characteristic can be realized by composing so that the memory content corresponding to the address is delivered as output signal, and by storing the predetermined input output characteristics. In this circuit, since processing is effected in the form of digital signal, the input output characteristic of the nonlinear processing circuit can be freely set, and it can be easily realized, in particular, by using ROM. As a result, the characteristic to suppress the noise without deteriorating the signal, the characteristic to improve the resolution of the picture without emphasizing the noise, and even the characteristic to suppress the noise and improve the picture resolution at the same time can be easily realized. Besides, since all processings are effected in the form of digital signal, all components can be formed on one chip semiconductor, so that reduction of size and manufacturing cost of the apparatus can be realized. Thus, many advantages are brought about. Incidentally, in the above circuit, the nonlinear processing circuit 122 has one nonlinear input output characteristic, but it may be also possible to possess plural nonlinear input output characteristics and use one of them selectively. This technique is explained by referring to Fig. 8, in which numeral 129 is a nonlinear processing circuit, 127 and 128 are input and output terminals of the nonlinear processing circuit 129. This nonlinear processing circuit 129 comprises nonlinear input output circuits 130a to 130n possessing different nonlinear input output characteristics, and a switch 131 to select one of these nonlinear input output circuits 130a to 130n, and this switch 131 is controlled by a control signal 132. This nonlinear processing circuit 129 can be easily realized, for example, by storing plural kinds of input output characteristics in a table in a ROM and selecting one of them. By using such nonlinear processing circuit 129, the frequency correction and noise reduction range can be properly adjusted depending on the property of picture, S N ratio or the taste of the user. Fig. 9 is a circuit block diagram of a second video signal processing apparatus which is described to aid understanding of this invention, in which numeral 133 is a filter composed of delay circuits 134a and 134b each with delay time D, coefficient circuits 135a to 135c with coefficeints 1 4, 1 2 and 1 4 respectively, and an adder 136, and numeral 137 is a delay circuit with delay time D for feeding the input luminance signal into the adder 132. In this second circuit, what differs from the first circuit in Fig. 4 lies in the composition of the filter 133 and the insertion of delay circuit 137. In the frequency region, the frequency characteristic of the filter 133 is nearly same as that of the filter 118 in Fig. 4 as shown in Fig. 5, and the relation between the characteristic of the nonlinear processing circuit 122 and the line from the input terminal 117 to output terminal 124 is nearly same as in the case of the first circuit explained with reference to Fig. 6 a and b . However, in the first circuit shown in Fig. 4, the delaytime from the input of the filter 118 to its output varies with the frequency, and the delay time of the signal from the input terminal 117 to the output terminal 124 varies, as a result of the above, depending on the frequency of input signal or characteristic of the nonlinear processing circuit 122, so that the picture quality may be unnaturally deteriorated. By contrast, in this circuit, the delay time between input and output of the filter 133 remains constant D regardless of the frequency of signal, and the delay time of the signal from input terminal 117 to output terminal 124 is always D, as a result of insertion of the delay circuit 137, regardless of the frequency or nonlinear processing characteristic, so that the signal may not be deteriorated. In this circuit, meanwhile, since the delay circuit 137 may be commonly replaced by the delay circuit 134a, so that the circuit scale can be reduced. Fig. 10 is a circuit block diagram of a third video signal processing apparatus which is described to aid understanding of this invention, which differs from the second circuit shown in Fig. 9 only in the filter composition and its frequency characteristic. Numeral 138 is a filter, which is composed of delay circuits 139a to 139c with delay time 3D, 2D and D, respectively, operating circuits 140a to 140c, and a coefficient circuit 141 with coefficient of 1 8. The delay circuit 139a also functions to delay the signal being led into the adder 132, without passing through the filter 138, by delay time 3D. The frequency characteristic of this filter 139 becomes a band passing type as shown in Fig. 11 when, for example, the delay time D is about 140 nsec. When the input output characteristic of the nonlinear processing circuit 122 is as shown by solid lines A to E in Fig. 6 a , the frequency characteristic of the circuit from the input terminal 117 to the output terminal 124 in Fig. 10 becomes as indicated by solid lines T to X in Fig. 12. At this time, the delay time of the signal from the input to output is always 3D, regardless of the frequency of input signal or input output characteristic of the nonlinear processing circuit 122. Therefore, when the input output characteristic of the nonlinear processing circuit 122 is set as shown in Fig. 7 a to f , it varies as indicated by solid lines T to X in Fig. 12 depending on the amplitude of the output signal of filter 138, so that the noise region or signal in a medium band of around 1 to 2 MHz can be emphasized. In this circuit, by using a band passing type filter, the noise in the medium band which is more impeding than the high band noise visually can be lessened. In a fourth example apparatus, a filter relating to the vertical frequency is used. Fig. 13 is a circuit block diagram of a fourth video signal processing apparatus which is described to aid understanding of this invention, in which numeral 210 is an input terminal being fed with a luminance signal after being reproduced by the VTR, frequency modulated, demodulated and digitized, 211 is a digital memory for delaying the input luminance signal by one horizontal scanning period 1H , 212 is a subtractor for subtracting the signal delayed by the digital memory 211 from the input luminance signal, 213 is a coefficient circuit for multiplying the output signal of the subtractor 212 by 1 2, 214 is a nonlinear processing circuit for delivering a specific output depending on the amplitude of the output signal of the coefficient circuit 213, 215 is a subtractor for subtracting the output of the nonlinear processing circuit 214 from the input signal, and 216 is an output terminal where a noise reduced output is obtained. The nonlinear processing circuit 214 is, similarly to the embodiment shown in Fig. 4, composed of, for example, a ROM. The operation of the video signal processing apparatus in this case thus composed is basically same as that of the prior art shown in Fig. 3, and the frequency characteristic from the input terminal 210 to the input of the nonlinear processing circuit 214 is as indicated by solid line in Fig. 3 b in the case of NTSC system, and the frequency characteristic of the circuit from the input terminal 210 to the output terminal 216 varies with the amplitude of the input signal of the nonlinear processing circuit 214. The input output characteristic of the nonlinear processing circuit 214 can be freely realized as shown in Fig. 7 same as in the case of the preceding circuit shown in Fig. 4, so that the reduction of noise and enhancement of resolution can be achieved. Thus, in this circuit, because of 1H delay by using digital memory, the size can be reduced the cost is lowered by the semiconductor composition, as compared with the conventional use of glass delay line only one demodulator is used and sufficient noise removing effect can be exhibited. In addition to these effects, because of nonlinear processing in the form of digital signal, any desired nonlinear input output characteristic can be realized. As a result, it is possible to remove only noise without deteriorating the vertical resolution as compared with the prior art, and the characteristic to suppress the noise and improve the vertical resolution of the signal at the same time can be also realized. Also in this circuit, it is possible to compose the nonlinear processing circuit 214 to possess plural input output characteristics as shown in Fig. 8. As a result, by selecting the input output characteristic properly depending on the type of picture or level of noise, it is possible to adjust the amount of noise reduction and the emphasis of the vertical resolution. Having described one dimensional filtering apparatus, below are described embodiments of the invention comprising plural digital filter means for dividing the horizontal and vertical two dimensional frequency region of digitized input luminance signal into plural two dimensional frequency bands, plural nonlinear processing means for nonlinearly processing the outputs of the plural filters, and a mixing means to mix the outputs of the plural nonlinear processing means. In this composition, the signal component and noise component may be separated more clearly, and the noise can be suppressed without deteriorating the signal component, and also the noise component superposing on the signal can be reduced efficiently. Fig. 14 is a configuration of video signal processing apparatus in a first embodiment of this invention, in which numeral 317 is an input signal of reproduced FM luminance signal being demodulated and digitized, and 322 is an output signal of the signal lowered in the noise level. Numeral 325 is a memory for delaying the signal by 1H, 326 is an adder, 327 is a subtractor, 328, 329, 330 and 331 are delay circuits each with delay time D where D about 140 nsec , 332 and 333 are adders, 334 and 335 are coefficient circuits for doubling the signal, 336 and 338 are adders, 337 and 339 are subtractors, 340 and 341 are coefficient circuits for multiplying the signal by 1 8, 344 to 346 are nonlinear processing circuits having nonlinear input output characteristics, and 347 is an adder for mixing the four output signals of the nonlinear processing circuits 344 to 346 and coefficient circuit 341. In this configuration, the transfer functions from the input terminal 317 to the coefficient circuits 340 to 343 are defined as follows, supposing the delay of delay time D to be z ¹ and the delay of H to be w ¹. When this embodiment is compared with the noise removing apparatusses shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. 13, there are several advantages. In explaining these advantages, the operation of the circuits of Fig. 9 and Fig. 13 and their cascade connection is discussed below in the two dimensional frequency region. In Fig. 9, the frequency band of the output of the filter 133, that is, the signal fed into the nonlinear processing circuit 122 corresponds, in Fig. 16, to bands II and IV. In Fig. 13, the band of the signal fed into the nonlinear processing circuit 214 corresponds to bands III and IV in Fig. 16. In both cases, the band is about 1 2 of the total two dimensional frequency region, and it must be noted that a relatively large energy is led into the nonlinear processing circuit. The operation of cascade connection of the circuits of Fig. 13 and Fig. 9 is as follows. The noise contained in the signal reproduced by the VTR is a white noise over an entire band, while the signal spectrum is concentrated in a narrow frequency band. Supposing the signal spectrum is present only in region I in Fig. 16, since the regions III and IV led into the nonlinear processing circuit in Fig. 13 and the regions II and IV led into the nonlinear processing circuit in Fig. 9 are both noise components of a small amplitude only, and noise existing in the frequency regions of II to IV will be suppressed. Or, if a signal spectrum with large amplitude is concentrated in the region III, the noise reducing effect by the apparatus in Fig. 13 is not present, but since the regions II and IV have only noise components of small amplitude, the noise in these regions is suppressed by the apparatus in Fig. 9. That is, the noise of the frequency components of II and IV superposed on the signal having spectrum in the region III is suppressed, and a favorable picture can be obtained. Similarly, when there are signal components only in the region II, the noise of the frequency components of III and IV superposed on the signal is suppressed by the device of Fig. 13. In this composition, however, if there is a signal component of large amplitude in the region IV which corresponds to the oblique component of picture image, the noise is not removed by the apparatusses of Fig. 13 and Fig. 9, and the noise of the frequency components II and III superposed on this signal cannot be reduced. By contrast, in this embodiment, as shown in Fig. 15 e to f , the signals led into individual nonlinear processing circuits are about 1 4 of the total two dimensional frequency region of the signal, being narrower as compared with the frequency band led into the nonlinear processing circuit in the embodiment shown in Fig. 9 or Fig. 8. Therefore, of the noise uniformly distributing in the entire band, the amplitude of the noise led into the respective nonlinear processing circuits decreases, and the non passing amplitude of the nonlinear input output characteristic shown in Fig. 17 a can be set smaller. To the contrary, since the signal components are concentrated in a narrow frequency band, one of the four filter outputs is concentrated, and the amplitude does not decrease so much. As a result, the signal and noise can be separated clearly, and only the noise can be reduced without much deteriorating delicate luminance changes. That is a first feature of this embodiment. As explained previously in relation to Fig. 16, when the embodiments of Fig. 13 and Fig. 9 are connected in cascade, the noise reducing effect is not obtained at all when there is a signal with large amplitude in the region IV which corresponds to the oblique component of picture image, and the noise superposed on this signal cannot be suppressed. In this embodiment, by contrast, since nonlinear processing is effected in each one of regions II to IV, if there is a signal with large amplitude in region IV, the noise of the frequency components in the regions II and III superposed on that signal can be suppressed, so that a favorable picture can be obtained. This is a second feature of this embodiment. A third feature is that different nonlinear processings can be given to the three frequency regions II to IV in Fig. 16. Generally, the reproduced signal of VTR is deteriorated in the high band of horizontal frequency. By contrast, the noise component in high band is hardly impeding visually, as compared with the noise in medium or low band. Accordingly, by setting the nonpassing amplitude of the nonlinear processing circuit in the regions II and IV smaller as compared with the region III containing the signal in the medium or low band of the horizontal frequency, deterioration of small signals in high band can be prevented, so that the picture can be visually improved. Concerning the frequency regions of II and IV, while the region II comprises signals of fine vertical patterns, the region IV corresponds to signals of fine oblique patterns. Generally, in the picture, the oblique pattern is not so important for small signals, as compared with the vertical pattern, with respect to the picture quality and visual effect. Accordingly, as compared with the non passing amplitude of the nonlinear processing circuit with respect to region II, by seating that of the region IV somewhat larger, the larger noise can be suppressed while hardly deteriorating the picture quality visually. In this embodiment, thus, the optimum nonlinear characteristic can be determined separately depending on the signal of divided frequency regions and nature of noise. As mentioned hereabove, this embodiment owns numerous excellent features. In addition to them, the entire device may be composed of semiconductors and structured as one chip IC, so that the device can be small sized, adjustment free, and lowered in cost, while only one frequency demodulator is needed. Moreover, in this embodiment, by determining the input output characteristic of the nonlinear processing circuit as shown in Fig. 17 b , the noise with small amplitude can be suppressed, while the signal with large amplitude can be emphasized, so that the resolution can be enhanced wihtout increasing the noise. Furthermore, not to mention, the nonlinear processing circuits 344, 345 and 346 may be composed to realize plural nonlinear input output characteristics as shown in Fig. 8. A second embodiment of this invention is described below. Fig. 18 is a configuration of a video processing apparatus in the second embodiment of this invention. What differs from the first embodiment shown above lies in the dropout compensating function making use of the signal delayed by 1H which is obtained at the time of making up the two dimensional filter. In Fig. 18, numeral 323 is an input terminal of dropout detection signal to tell the presence or absence of dropout, 324 is a switch to be controlled by the dropout detection signal, and other parts are same as in the embodiment shown in Fig. 14 and are given the same numerals. The operation of thus composed embodiment is as follows. The switch 323 is usually connected to the upper side, where an excellent noise removing effect is obtained exactly the same as in the embodiment shown in Fig. 14. On the other hand, when dropout occurs in the input signal, it is controlled so that the switch 324 is connected to the lower side by the dropout detection signal fed from the switch 323. As a result, the output of the switch 324 is replaced by the 1H delayed signal, so that the dropout is compensated. In this embodiment, besides the excellent noise removing effect as in the embodiment in Fig. 14, compensation of dropout in the form of digital signal by using 1H delayed signal is effected, and unlike the conventional case of compensating the FM signal with the signal delayed by glass delay line, the annoying noise caused by discontinuity at the phase change point of FM signal does not occur in principle. Or even against a dropout longer than 1H, the compensating signal is not deteriorated due to decrease of amplitude or band, so that an excellent compensation is achieved.
