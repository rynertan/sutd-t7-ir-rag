# CALENDAR

## Abstract
A calendar utilizes an existing relationship binding together all dates, past and future, in relation to any starting date. The constant relationship between days of the week, months of the year, and numbers enables the user of the calendar without resorting to calculation to find and display any other date not known in advance by simple manipulation of moving components of the calendar. For any given date as a reference point, one may determine, for example, the day of the week of any past or future date without prior knowledge or calculation over the full range of dates encompassed by the calendar.
