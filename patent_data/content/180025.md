# SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE COMPRISING A BIPOLAR TRANSISTOR AND A MOSFET

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a semiconductor de vice having complicated bipolar transistor and MOSFET. In an equivalent circuit of this semiconductor device, MOSFET 3 is connected between the base 33 and emitter 34 of the bipolar transistor 1 . The bipolar transistor 1 is a vertical type transistor, and MOSFET 3 a lateral type tran sistor. The MOSFET 3 is formed on a base 33 surface on the side of one main surface on which the emitter 34 of the bipolar transistor 1 is exposed, in such a manner that the MOSFET 3 is substantially opposed to the emitter 34 .
