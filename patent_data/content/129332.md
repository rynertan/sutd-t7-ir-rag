# Process for preparing carboxylic acid anhydrides.

## Abstract
Acetic anhydrde is prepared by reacting, at elevated temperature, methyl acetate or dimethyl ether with carbon monoxide in the presence of an effective amount of a catalyst which comprises 1 cobalt, 2 a compound containing at least one quaternary nitrogen or phosphorus atom and 3 a source of iodide or bromide wherein the atomic ratio of iodide or bromide to cobalt is from 0.5 1 to 5 1. The compound containing at least one quaternary nitrogen or phosphorus atom can optionally by generated in situ by a quarternisation reaction.
