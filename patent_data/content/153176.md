# Middle distillate compositions with improved cold flow properties.

## Abstract
The low temperature properties of a distillate petroleum fuel oil boiling in the range 120 C to 500 C, and whose 20 and 90 distillation points differ by less than 100 C, and or whose Final Boiling Point is in the range 340 C to 370 C are improved by the addition of a polymer or copolymer having at least 25 wt. of n alkyl groups of average number of carbon atoms from 12 to 14 with no more than 10 wt. containing more than 14 carbon atoms.
