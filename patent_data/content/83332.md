# ASYMMETRIC REDUCTION OF NITRO CONTAINING PROCHIRAL COMPOUNDS

## Abstract
There is described the heretofore unknown catalytic asymmetric reduction of the nitro group of nonolefinic prochiral substrates, together with a new route to lysine from caprolactam via N formyl 3 nitro caprolactam, 3 nitro caprolactam and 3 aminocaprolactam as intermediates.
