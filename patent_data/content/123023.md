# Aqueous composition and method of providing the same.

## Abstract
Aqueous thermosetting coating compositions adapted for roll coat application are disclosed in which water has dispersed therein an adduct of a diglycidyl ether of a bis phenol having a 1,2 epoxy equivalency of at least 1.2 and an average molecular weight of from about 2000 to about 5000 with a stoichiometric proportion, based on epoxy and secon dary amine, of diprimary amine having a single secondary amine group and each primary amine group blocked by a ketimine group. At least about 50 of the amine groups of this adduct are protonated with a volatile acid, and the ketimine groups hydrolyze in the water to provide primary amine func tionality and ketone solvent in the aqueous medium. From 20 to 50 , based on total resin solids, of water insoluble, heathardening phenol formaldehyde resin curing agent is employed for cure. The curing agents are added to the adduct in solution in water miscible organic solvent, and cresol formaldehyde curing agents are preferred.
