# Single crystal growing method and apparatus.

## Abstract
The main point of the present invention is to minimize impurity contamination and to prevent a heat convection from affecting the solid melt interface by floating a baffle plate 16 in the interior of a crucible 7 which contains a feed melt 12 in order to obtain a single crystal 15 of a small dislocation density, in pulling up a single crystal 15 of a compound semiconductor having a high melting point and exhibiting high dissociation pressure at the said melting point such as a compound semiconductor of Groups III V, especially GaAs or Gap. Improvement is made on the shape of the baffle plate 16 and on baffle plate moving means 18 , and this baffle plate 16 is suitably combined with suitably selected intra furnace pressure or heating means or temper ature measuring means.
