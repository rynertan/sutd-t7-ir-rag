# High tensile steel and process for producing the same.

## Abstract
A high tensile steel which has a satisfactory yield strength of 60 kg mm² or more and excellent resistances to sulfide corrosive cracking and corrosion, and which comprises, as indispensable components, 0.05 to 0.50 wt of C, 0.1 to 1.0 wt of Si, 0.1 to 2.0 wt of Mn, 0.05 to 1.50 wt of Co and the balance consisting of Fe, is produced by hot or cold rolling it, rapidly heating the rolled steel to austenitize it, quenching the austenitized steel and, finally, tempering the quenched steel at a temperature not higher than the Ac₁ point of the steel.
