# A METHOD OF CLEANING A TUBULAR MEMBRANE MODULE

## Abstract
A method of cleaning a reverse osmosis tubular mem brane module which has a plurality of tubular membrane tubes 50 arranged in a set of parallel supporting tubes 12 with an axial annular permeate flow channel 64 defined between each membrane tube and the supporting tube 12 within which it is contained. Following use of the module to separate a permeate from a feed stream the thin annular permeate channels are flushed with a cleaning solution, to clean the permeate flow channels and the exterior permeate back surface of the membrane tubes, without passing the cleaning solution through the membrane of the membrane tube.
