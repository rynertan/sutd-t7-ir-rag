# High profile structures, e.g. for soil retention or drainage.

## Abstract
In order to make a high profile structure, a planar, biaxially heat shrinkable, plastics mesh layer 1 is fixed to a planar, relatively non heat shrinkable plastics mesh layer 2 at zones 3 which are spaced apart on a generally square grid, and the structure so formed is heated to cause the shrink layer 1 to shrink biaxially and thereby cause the non shrink layer 2 to assume a cuspated configuration. This provides an inexpensive, dimensionally stable, regular high profile, bulked structure. The structure can be shipped as a semi finished product after fixing the layers together and before heating, thereby reducing bulk and hence shipping costs.
