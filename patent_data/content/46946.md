# Universal rotating machine for expanding or compressing a compressible fluid.

## Abstract
A pair of tangential rotors 14, 16 are provided on separate shafts dependently rotatable in a housing, one having a vane 60 and the other a notch 70 for allowing passage of the vane, to form a fluid tight segmented annular region through which the vane moves. A valve admits 106 a mass of high pressure compressible fluid to the region through a triangular port 98 for expansion, or from the region after compression, the mass of fluid being confined in a portion of the region between the vane and the surface of the notched rotor and changing in pressure because of the change in arcuate length and thus volume of the confined region portion. Multiple pairs of rotors may be included on the one rotor and two notches on the other. Two vaned rotors may cooperate with one notched rotor, the vaned rotors being on separate shafts.
