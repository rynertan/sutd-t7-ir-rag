# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING BIAXIALLY ORIENTED POLYESTER FILM.

## Abstract
Process for producing biaxially oriented polyester film, which comprises stretching an unoriented polyester film in a longitudinal direction such that the Δn becomes 0.030 to 0.055, then in the same direction such that Δn becomes 0.080 or less and n becomes 1.600 or less in a temperature range of 95 to 150 C, followed by stretching in a transverse direction. The resulting film has good smoothness and sliding proper ties, undergoes less breakage, and has less unevenness in thickness, thus being useful as base film for magnetic tape, particularly VTR tape.
