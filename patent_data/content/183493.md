## Description
This invention relates to a novel modified ethylenic random copolymer. More specifically, it relates to a liquid modified ethylenic random copolymer which can exhibit excellent performance, for example as a modifier or modifying aid for various resins or rubbery polymers, a lubricant oil additive, or a dispersing aid for aqueous dispersions of resins or rubbery polymers. It is known that modified olefinic polymers obtained by graft copolymerizing high molecular weight olefinic polymers such as polyethylene or polypropylene with monomers such as unsaturated carboxylic acids, anhydrides thereof, styrene and unsaturated silane Compounds are used as modifiers for resins, adhesives, tackifiers, etc. Since, however, these modified olefinic polymers have a high molecular weight and are solid, they do not exhibit sufficient performance in some applications. Some modified olefinic polymers having a relatively low molecular weight, on the other hand, have been proposed which are obtained by graft copolymerizing liquid olefinic polymers such as low molecular weight polybutene or polyisobutylene with unsaturated carboxylic acids, the anhydrides or esters thereof, unsaturated silane compounds, etc. see U.S. Patents Nos. 3,912,764 and 4,320,214, British Patent No. 1,480,453, Japanese Patent Publication No. 23,668 1977, and Japanese Laid Open Patent Publications Nos. 144,995 1978, 28,386 1979 and 149,741 1979 . These low molecular weight modified olefinic polymers, however, do not show excellent performance in such applications as modifiers or modifying aids for rubbery polymers, particularly silicon containing rubbery polymers, lubricant oil additives and dispersing aids for aqueous dispersions of resins or rubbery polymers. In the compounding of rubbery polymers, attempts have been made to provide rubbery polymer compositions having excellent weatherability, oxidation resistance and tackiness by incorporating an ethylene alpha olefin or ethylene alpha olefin diene elastomeric copolymer in natural rubber or a synthetic rubbery polymer such as polyisoprene, polyisobutylene or chloroprene. The mere blending of the two, however, has the defect of causing a deterioration in the dynamical properties of the resulting composition, and usually to remove this defect, the aforesaid low molecular weight modified olefinic polymers are incorporated as a modifying aid. The modifying effect of these modified polymers is small and not satisfactory. Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 147533 1982 proposes a modified low molecular weight olefinic polymer obtained by graft copolymerizing a waxy low molecular weight olefinic polymer with a styrene type hydrocarbon compound as a releasability improver for styrene type polymers. However, a tackifier composition prepared by incorporating such a modified low molecular weight olefinic polymer as a modifier or modifying aid in a styrene type polymer such as a styrene isoprene styrene block copolymer to be sometimes abbreviated as SIS has poor tack and adhesion strength. Among the conventional styrene type polymers, SIS has a large cohesive force, but cannot by itself give a tackifier having excellent tack and adhesion strength. It has therefore been the practice to incorporate various modifiers in order to use these styrene polymers in the field of tackifiers. For example, it is known to incorporate a process oil or modified wax in SIS, but this brings about a defect such as a reduction in the adhesion strength of the resulting composition. It has been desired in this field therefore to develop a modifier which when incorporated into such a styrene polymer as SIS, can give a composition having excellent tack and adhesion strength. One object of this invention is to provide a low molecular weight modified ethylenic copolymer which is useful as a modifier or a modifying aid for various resins and rubbery polymers, particularly as a modifying aid for rubbery polymer compositions, and can give rubbery polymer compositions or modified resins having excellent dynamical properties when incorporated as a modifying aid in rubbery polymer compositions comprising natural rubber or a rubbery polymer such as polyisobutylene or chloroprene and an ethylene alpha olefin or ethylene alpha olefin diene elastomeric copolymer or in resins such as polyolefins and polyethylene terephthalate. Another object of this invention is to provide a low molecular weight modified ethylenic copolymer which when incorporated as a modifier in a styrene type polymer, gives a styrene type polymer composition having excellent tack and or adhesion strength. Still another object of this invention is to provide a low molecular weight modified ethylenic copolymer which exhibits excellent performance in such applications as a lubricant oil additive or a dispersing aid for aqueous dispersions of resins or rubbery polymers. Other objects of this invention along with its advantages will become apparent from the following description. According to this invention, there is provided a liquid modified ethylenic random copolymer derived from 100 parts by weight of a base ethylenic random copolymer composed of 25 to 75 mole of ethylene and 75 to 25 mole of an alpha olefin having 3 to 20 carbon atoms and having a number average molecular weight The modified ethylenic random copolymer of the invention will now be described in detail. The ethylenic random copolymer as a base of the modified ethylenic random copolymer of this invention is a random copolymer, preferably being liquid, prepared by copolymerizing ethylene with at least one alpha olefin having 3 to 20 carbon atoms. The random copolymer is composed of 25 to 75 mole , preferably 30 to 70 mole , more preferably 40 to 60 mole , of ethylene units and 75 to 25 mole , preferably 70 to 30 mole , more preferably 60 to 40 mole , of C₃ C₂₀ alpha olefin units the mole is based on the total amount of ethylene and C₃ C₂₀ alpha olefin and a number average molecular weight of 200 to 10000. The ethylenic random copolymer as a base desirably has at least one, preferably all, of the following properties. More specific methods of determining the molecular weight distribution b , the number average molecular weight c and the Z value d are as follows The number average molecular weight and weight average molecular weight of the copolymer are measured by the following method. For details of the method, reference may be made to Journal of Polymer Science, Part A II, vol. 8, pages 89 103 1970 . Elution counts of a standard substance having a known molecular weight 16 samples of monodisperse polystyrene having different molecular weights selected from the range of 500 to 840 10⁴ were measured by GPC gel permeation chromatography , and a calibration curve showing the relation between the molecular weight and the elution count was prepared. The GPC pattern of a copolymer sample was taken by GPC. From the calibration curve, the molecular weights Mi at the individual counts i were read, and from the GPC pattern, the elution volumes Ni at the individual counts i were read. The number average molecular weight Thus, the Mn, Q value and Z value of the copolymer of this invention were calculated by the following equations. The minimum and maximum elution counts of the GPC pattern of the copolymer were read, and the corresponding minimum and maximum molecular weights of the copolymer, calculated as polystyrene, were read from the calibration curve. The Z value was thus calculated from the following equation.

The copolymerization of ethylene with the alpha olefin can be carried out by using Ziegler catalysts known The ethylenic random compolymer used as a base in this invention is preferably liquid at ordinary temperature. But when a styrene type hydrocarbon or an unsaturated silane compound is used as the modifier, the ethylenic random copolymer may sometimes be one which has a high ethylene content and a high intrinsic viscosity and is semi solid at ordinary temperature. In this case, the ethylenic random copolymer may have a crystallinity, as measured by X ray diffractometry, of usually not more than 5 , preferably not more than 2 .

Among these, C₃ C₆ unsaturated carboxylic acids or its anhydride such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, maleic anhydride and glycidyl methacrylate, especially maleic acid, or anhydrides thereof such as maleic anhydride, and mono or di lower alkyl esters thereof are preferred. The term lower , as used herein, means that a group or compound qualified by this term has not more than 6, preferably not more than 4, carbon atoms. The proportion of the unsaturated carboxylic acid compound grafted to the ethylenic random copolymer is 0.2 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 0.5 to 40 parts by weight, especially preferably 1 to 30 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the ethylenic random copolymer. Suitable styrene type hydrocarbons are those corresponding to the following formula wherein R¹ and R², independently from each other, represent a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms.

In the present invention, the proportion of the grafting monomer grafted to the base polymer is expressed in parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the ethylenic random copolymer in the modified ethylenic random copolymer. In the case of a modified ethylenic random copolymer having grafted thereto the alpha,beta carboxylic acid compound a , the proportion of the compound a grafted is determined from the oxygen content of the copolymer measured by an oxygen analyzer and the IR analysis of the copolymer. The proportion of the styrene type hydrocarbon b grafted is determined by C¹³ NMR analysis, and the proportion of the unsaturated silane compound c grafted is determined from the weight of Si measured by weight analysis. The modified ethylenic random copolymer of this invention can be produced by reacting graft copolymerizing the ethylenic random copolymer with the modifier in the presence of a radical initiator. The reaction can be carried out usually in an inert gas atmosphere in the presence of a solvent, or in the absence of a solvent. The reaction can be carried out, for example, by continuously or intermittently feeding the modifier compound and the radical initiator with stirring to the heated liquid ethylenic random copolymer in the presence or absence of a solvent. The proportions of the modifier and the radical initiator fed in this graft copolymerization reaction, and the reaction temperature and time can be varied depending upon the type of the modifier, etc. Generally, these reaction conditions may be selected as tabulated below according to the type of the modifier compound. Usually organic peroxides are used as the radical initiator for the graft copolymerization reaction. The organic peroxides preferably have a decomposition temperature, at which the half value is 1 minute, of 60 to 270 C, especially 150 to 270 C.
