# Method and apparatus for conducting logging operations in a borehole.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for logging earth formations surrounding a borehole, particularly a deviated borehole, includes providing a drill pipe 143 with a tubular protection means 145 which forms an extension to the drill pipe 143 , attaching a well tool 141 within the protection means and lowering the protection means 145 with the tool 141 into the borehole. The tool which is releasably attached within the protection means 145 is released from the protection means and displaced beyond the protection means before moving the tool through the borehole 140 to log at least a portion of the formations surrounding the borehole.
