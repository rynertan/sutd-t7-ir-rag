# Semiconductor laser apparatus with isolator.

## Abstract
A laser diode 2 is mounted on a block 101 forming part of a base structure 1 . The diode is hermetically sealed within a cap 3 provided with a window 4 for the emission of light. The p n junction plane of the laser diode 2 is parallel to the vertical surface on which it is mounted and light is emitted through an end surface of the diode in a direction normal to the window 4 . In order to prevent return light from disturbing the diode and creating noise, the window 4 is formed of magneto optical material which is magnetically saturated by an external annular magnet 5 . The thickness of the window 4 is such that the plane of polarization of the emitted light is rotated 45 by Faraday rotation. A further 45 rotation is imposed on any returning light so that there is a 90 rotation relative to the plane in which the laser diode 2 is active. In other embodiment the magneto optical material is deposited on the inside of a glass window or on the end surface of the diode.
