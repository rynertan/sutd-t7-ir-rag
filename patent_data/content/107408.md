# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING ETHANOL

## Abstract
Ehtanol is produced from biomass in a single plate still by pasteurizing the biomass in the still and distilling water therefrom, fermenting the biomass, and distilling off the ethanol produced. The residual biomass my be concentrated, in the same still, to produce a dried feed. The aqueous ethanol obtained may be concentrated by treatment with a dehydrating agent and distill ation. The dehydrating agent is preferably regenerated and re used.
