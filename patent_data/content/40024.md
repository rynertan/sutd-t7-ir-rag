# Power assisted vehicle steering system.

## Abstract
A power assisted vehicle steering system has a pressure biased piston and cylinder 1 actuation of which effects in the power assistance. The piston 2 has axially opposed faces 5, 7 with different effective pressurised areas of which the face 5 with the smaller area communicates with a first chamber 6 and the face 7 with the larger effective area communi cates with a second chamber 8 . A valve 10 which is axially adjustable but may be rotary in response to a steering man oeuvre controls flow of pressure fluid from the pump 9 to the piston and cylinder 1 for providing power assistance. The valve 10 derives fluid pressure from the pump 9 through a restrictor 26 which may be adjustable and has a neutral condition in which the first and second chambers 6,8 and the pump output communicate with the reservoir by way of con trol ports 18, 19 , 20 in the valve, the second chamber 8 communicates with the pump by way of the restrictor 26 and the control port 19 and the first chamber 6 communicates with the pump upstream of the restrictor 26 and the control port 19 . The restrictor 26 is arranged so that with the valve 10 in its neutral condition the fluid pressure in the second chamber 8 provides an axial force on the piston face 7 which balances the opposing axial force on the smaller piston face 5 .
