# BOOM FOR SAILBOARDS

## Abstract
The free corner of a sail is secured to a boom with the interposition of means which are apt to transform the lateral forces acting on the boom into axial pulling forces on the sail end, thus maintaining the sail constantly in stretched condition, regardless of the elastic deformation undergone by the boom spars.
