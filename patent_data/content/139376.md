# System and apparatus for continuously fractionating blood in situ.

## Abstract
A system, method and device for continuously frac tionating blood in situ. The fractionating device 25 is connected in a closed loop to the donor 30 and includes interleaved blood plates 55 and blood fraction plates 50 separated by a semipermeable membrane 75 . Grooves 95 in the plates direct blood flow and blood fraction collection. Uniform distribution among the plates 50, 55 and intraplate 60 is obtained by manifolds 110 . A device 25 for continuously producing blood fraction, comprises a stack 45 of at least two plates 50, 55 having at least one surface 102 with a blood flow channel 100 therein separated by a semipermeable membrane 75 selectively permeable to the blood fraction, an inlet 26 for conducting blood to each blood flow channel 100 and an outlet 36 for conducting blood therefrom to establish a longitudinally extending blood flow path, each blood flow channel 100 having a distribution portion 110 for uniformly distributing blood transversely of the blood flow path and a transfer portion 160 extending longitudinally thereof, each collection chan nel 90 being substantially in registry with said transfer portion 160 of said facing blood flow channel 100 for receiving the blood fraction passing through said membrane 75 , and a fraction outlet 98 for conducting the blood fraction from each collection channel 90 , whereby the blood fraction continuously transfer from blood passing through said transfer portion 160 of each blood flow channel 100 through the membrane 75 to the adjacent collection channel 90 to said fraction outlet 98 .
