# SPEED CONTROL SWITCH DEVICE

## Abstract
A speed control switch device includes a retractable trigger and a swingable reversing lever to control the power to, the speed of, and the direction of rotation of a motor in a hand held electric tool, such as a drill. A single printed circuit board mounts the elements of the solid state speed control circuit and also mounts a first set of contacts, a second set of contacts, and a resistance strip which comprise integral parts of a reversing switch, an on off switch, and a rheostat, respectively.
