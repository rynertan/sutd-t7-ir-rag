# Ribbon type electro acoustic transducer with an increased operating frequency range.

## Abstract
A ribbon type electro acoustic transducer has a magnet system which comprises a pole plate 2, 3 and a centre pole 1 between which an air gap 8 is formed. A diaphragm 7 on which conductors 9 are arranged, is disposed in the air gap. The cavity 15 enclosed by the magnet system and the diap hragm 7 can be acoustically coupled, as the case may be via an additional cavity 16 , to a bass reflex duct 17 . This results in a transducer with an operating frequency range which has been extended towards lower frequencies.
