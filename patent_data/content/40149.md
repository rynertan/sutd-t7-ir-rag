# Oligopeptides with specific inhibiting properties of collagen induced aggregation, process for preparing the same and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.

## Abstract
The invention relates to oligopeptides with specific inhibiting properties of collagen induced aggregation, pro cess for preparing the same and pharmaceutical composi tions containing them. These peptides comprise no more than 10 aminoacids containing the following sequence N ter A X₁ Gly Y Gly X₂ A C ter in which X₁ and X₂ represent, independently from each other, either a hydroxyprolyl or a prolyl residue Y represents either a Z X₃ or a X₃ Z residue wherein X₃ is a hydroxyprolyl or prolyl residue and Z is a spacer aminoacyl residue and A is preferably a lysyl residue Z is preferably a glutaminyl, glutamyl, aspartyl or asparaginyl residue.
