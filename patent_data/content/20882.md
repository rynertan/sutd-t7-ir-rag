# Non asbestos millboard composition, products thereof and process for their preparation.

## Abstract
A non asbestos millboard refractory composition useful for the manufacture of lehr and glass tempering rolls and useful at temperatures above about 650 C. comprises on a dry weight basis 10 30 percent ceramic fiber, 0 10 percent organic fiber, 35 60 percent pyrophyllite and 20 35 percent inorganic binder. This composition is particularly useful in the manufacture of a non asbestos millboard sheet which is formed by preparing an aqueous slurry of the components of this composition, adding flocculant and developing the flocculated composition into sheet form by placing the slurry on a rotating screened cylinder to effect formation and dewatering, transfering the dewatered and formed slurry to a synthetic felt and then to an accumulator roll, where layers of the slurry are accumulated upon one another to a desired thickness. The accumulated layers are then slit, removed and formed into flat sheets of desired dimensions for subsequent use.
