# Magnetic reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
A magnetic reproducing apparatus comprises two rotary magnetic heads 6a, 6b mounted on respective bimorphs 7a, 7b , the heads 6a, 6b being displaceable in the transverse direction relative to recorded tracks 11a, 11b on a magnetic tape 10 is reponse to control voltages applied to the respective bimorphs 7a, 7b to effect correct scanning of the tracks 11a, 11b , a pulse generator 48 for generating a first pulse signal of frequency dependent on the transport speed of the tape 10 , a first counter 47 for counting the pulses of the first pulse signal to produce a first count output each time a head 6a, 6b completes scanning of a track 11a, 11b , a second counter 68 which, starting from the first count output, count the pulses of a second pulse signal which has a frequency which is an integral multiple of the frequency of the first pulse signal and produces a second count output, and a circuit 70, 71a, 71b to derive from the second count output control voltages for supply to the bimorphs 7a, 7b to preset the positions of the heads 6a, 6b relative to the tracks 11a, 11b each time a head 6a, 6b is to start scanning a track 11a, 11b . The apparatus further comprises a third counter 80 for counting the pulses of the first pulse signal to produce a respective third count output corresponding to each scan of a track 11a, 11b by a head 6a, 6b , a subtractor 83 to derive a difference output from each third count output and the immediately preceding third count output, and an adder 84 to add the difference output to the second count output prior to supply to the circuit 70, 71a, 71b for deriving the control voltage, whereby the control voltages and modified in dependence on acceleration or deceleration of the transport speed of the tape 10 .
