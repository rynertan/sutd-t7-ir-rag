# Thermal system based on thermally coupled intermittent absorption heat pump cycles.

## Abstract
A combined intermittently operated heat pump device which comprises n combinations n being an integer equal to or greater than 2 of intermittently operated heat cycles, each combination comprising of vessels accommodating therein different kinds of absorbent material MH, MH₂, MH₃, MH₄ having different temperature and pressure characteristics and coupled with each other by means of a piping through which a common working medium can flow. The 2n batches of the absorbent materials in the respective vessels include at least n 1 kinds of the absorbent material having different tempera ture and equilibrium pressure characteristics, at least one temperature of heat of absorption in one of the cycles being selected to be higher than the temperature of heat of desorp tion in at least one of the remaining cycles. A heat transporta tion passage 13 is provided between the one of the cycles and the at least one of the remaining cycles for enabling the heat generated in the one of the cycles to be used as a heat input to the at least one of the remaining cycles.
