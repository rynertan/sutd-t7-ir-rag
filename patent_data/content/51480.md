# Laminate films for heat shrink packaging foodstuffs.

## Abstract
Problems with prior art laminate films used for heat shrink packaging of foodstuffs, such as insufficient oil and peel resistance, are overcome by a laminate film comprising a center layer and two outermost layers with a respective adhesive layer between the center layer and each outermost layer, and being capable of exhibiting a rate of heat shrinkage at 90 C of more than 15 , the center layer consisting of a copolymer I of vinylidene chloride and both the outermost layers consisting of from 20 to 70 by weight of a copolymer II of ethylene and an alpha olefin, the copolymer II having a crystalline melting point of 110 to 125 C, and from 80 to 30 by weight of a copolymer III of ethylene and vinyl acetate, the copolymer III having a crystalline melting point of 85 to 103 C, the content of copolymer II in the total amount of copolymers in both the outermost layers being less than 65 by weight.
