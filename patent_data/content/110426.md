# Epihalohydrin polymer blends.

## Abstract
Blends of epihalohydrin polymers and lower polyolefins containing an acid acceptor, an unsaturated polyfunctional acrylate or methacrylate, and a coagent that is cured with an organic peroxide provide low viscosity, improved hardness, easy processing, and improved physical properties on curing.
