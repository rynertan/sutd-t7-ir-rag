# Method of recording X ray images and imaging chamber suited therefor.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method is described for producing an electric field distribution in an imaging chamber corresponding with that of spherical caps. By adequately choosing the distance between annular ring electrodes provided on or in the electrodes of the imaging chamber, use may be made of a high DC voltage generator of the cascade type so that the voltage applied to each annular electrode is an integer of a basic voltage. Also the voltage over the gap may so be generated. As a consequence, only one high DC voltage is necessary for generating all the voltages of the whole system.
