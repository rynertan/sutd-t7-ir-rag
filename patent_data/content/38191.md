# 5 Acylsalicylanilides derivatives and method for inhibiting the growth of microorganisms.

## Abstract
The composition comprises certain 5 Acylsalicylanilides and more particularly comprises the compounds encom passed by the following generic formula The preferred compositions of the invention have a parti tion coefficient greater than 4 and the substituted moieties in the phenyl ring of the Z group have a combined overall electron withdrawing effect on the phenyl ring of the Z group. The method of the invention comprises contacting the microorganism with a sufficient concentration of the above composition for a sufficient time to inhibit the growth of the mi croorganism. The above compositions are effective antiseptics against a wide range of microorganisms, especially bacteria, and the compositions surprisingly are especially effective against mi croorganisms prevalent in dental plaque.
