# CATCHMENT PACKS

## Abstract
This invention relates to catchment packs of the type commonly utilized in platinum metal catalysed ammonia oxidation plants for the manufacture of nitric acid. In more detail there is disclosed a catchment pack suitable for locating downstreams of a platinum group metal catalyst in an ammonia oxidation reactor for the purpose of recovering volatilised platinum group metal or oxides there of and comprising getter material in the form of an agglomeration or assemblage of unwoven randomly oriented fibres sandwiched between support gauzes made from an oxidation resistant material, wherein the pack comprises a plurality of segments arranged in the same plane so as substantially to cover the cross sectional area of the reactor, each segment containing said fibres sandwiched between said support gauzes in substantially stable regular distribution and having at least one essentially straight edge contiguous with an essentially straight edge on an adjacent segment.
