# Thermoset relief patterned sheet.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a flexible composite sheet material having a thermoset patterned relief surface of high quality and definition which is particularly useful for producing high quality optical sheet components such as a lenticular screen sheet for producing three dimensional pic tures and photographs. The composite sheet 10 comprises a flexible base film 11 having front and rear surfaces and a layer 12 of a cured thermosetting polymer overlying the front sur face of the base film. The cured thermosetting polymer layer has a nonplanar outer surface 13 defining a predetermined desired relief pattern of high quality and durability and of fine definition in the thermosetting polymer layer.
