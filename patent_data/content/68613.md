# Disc bake assemblies having retraction control mechanism.

## Abstract
A sliding caliper disc brake assembly includes grip and slip retraction and knockback control mechanism 88, involving a spring washer 104 and a friction ring 110, effective between the caliper piston 54 and the caliper housing 24, and additionally grip and slip retraction and knockback control mechanism 120, involving a spring washer 162 and a friction ring 192, effective between the caliper housing 24 and a fixed mounting bolt 16 for the caliper 12, to provide zero brake lining drag in the brake released condition, without undue lost pedal travel.
