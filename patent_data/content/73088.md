# OBTAINING ENERGY FROM CRYOGENIC FLUIDS

## Abstract
A plant for converting a cryogenic fluid into gas, comprises a container 1 for the cryogenic fluid, means such as a pipe 2 and a pump 3 for supplying the fluid from the container 1 to a vaporising plant 5 for converting the cryogenic fluid into a gas stream at super atmospheric pressure, means 6, 12 for supplying the gas stream to the inlet of a gas expander 16 which includes a rotor 18 drivable by the gas stream, which rotor 18 comprises an output drive shaft 22 , an alternating current generator 28 arranged to be driven by the shaft 22 and a voltage and frequency converter 32 having its input side connected to the electrical output of the generator 28 and its output side connected to an electrical power network 15 . The converter 32 is of the kind which, over a predetermined range of the speed of rotation of the generator 28 , delivers at its output side electric power at a voltage and frequency which at all times conform to the voltage and frequency of the network 15 .
