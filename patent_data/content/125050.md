# Apparatus for measuring the temperature and other parameters of an electric power conductor.

## Abstract
A self contained hot stick mounted radio transmitting module capable of measuring the temperature of the power conductor of an electrical transmission line, and the tempera ture of the ambient air. It may also measure one or more electrical characteristics of the conductor. The data are trans mitted for local display and or at a power control center. The modules are donut shaped and open like a pair of jaws. One or more spring loaded temperature probes 54, 72 are located such that they may be pushed against a power line 42 when a donut is mounted to a hot stick 70 with the jaws open. Power to an open module is supplied by a battery. Power to a closed module, mounted on a conductor, may be supplied by the battery or by power derived from the conductor. A donut may be left on the power line for an indefinite time and the hot stick removed, or instantaneous measure ments may be made with the hot stick attached, and the module then immediately removed. The temperature probe of the present invention com prises a pair of concentric spring loaded tubes 227, 230 . A beryllia insert 56 is mounted between a temperature sensor 52 and the power conductor.
