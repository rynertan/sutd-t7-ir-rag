# Method and device for inspecting a moving sheet material for streaklike defects.

## Abstract
Identification of subtle streaklike defects 13, 14 in running webs 10 and sheets by transversely scanning distinct lateral sections of the webs or sheets by means of lines 15, 16 of radiant energy that run parallel with the direction of movement 11 of the webs or sheets. Trans mitted or reflected radiation is received on corresponding photocells 18 that move synchronously with the lines of radiant energy. During each scan of each section of the webs or sheets, a large number of comparisons occur between the output signals of each photocell 18 at a given first lateral position and at a second lateral position that is separated from the first one by a distance b that is of the order of magnitude of the width a and preferably half the width, of a streaklike defect to be indentified.
