# Method and apparatus for laying a pipeline on the sea bottom.

## Abstract
Apparatus and method for laying a pipeline on the sea bottom which includes a boyant body 12 comprised of a toroidal buoyancy tank, a central hub 16 and radial spokes. The body 12 is adapted to carry a single, continuous length of pipe. The pipe 28 is wrapped on the body 12 when he is horizontally disposed and floating on the water. The body 12 with the convolutions of pipe 28 are towed to the second site while the body 12 and the pipe 28 remain horizontally disposed. The the tank receives over valves 74 sea water to unbalance the body 12 and cause it to be moved into a vertical position. In this position, the body 12 is towed for wardly and rotated to allow the pipe 28 to be vertically unwrapped from the body 12 and to gravitate therefrom. A second tank 30 having a power mechanism 41 which is coupled by gear 43 with the body 12 to rotate the body during a pipe laying operation or during the pipe 28 will be wrapped onto the body 12 .
