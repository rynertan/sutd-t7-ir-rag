# Process for blowing film from linear thermoplastic material.

## Abstract
A process for the continuous blowing of film from such linear thermoplastic materials which after that the plastic melt has left an annular die, when introducing gas into the interior of the tube, forms a neck part having an essentially constant diameter and then forms a rapidly expanding main bubble whereby the speed of the film at the upper part of the neck is kept above 15 m min..
