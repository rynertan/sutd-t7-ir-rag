# Monoclonal antibodies, processes for their preparation and methods for their use.

## Abstract
Monoclonal antibodies specific for unglycosylated human interferon beta are prepared by immunizing a mammal with unglycosylated human interferon beta to produce cells capable of producing antibodies in the body of said mammal, fusing said cell with lined myeloma cells originating from a mammal other than the immunized mammal, selecting the resultant fused cells for the production of antibodies specific for unglycosylated human interferon beta , subjecting the selected fused cells to cloning to produce monoclones, selecting the resultant monoclones for reactivity with at least one member selected from unglycosylated human interferon beta and other human interferons, culturing the selected monoclones, and recovering the desired monoclonal antibody from the culture thereby obtained. Such monoclonal antibodies specific for unglycosylated human interferon beta are used in processes for the purification and quantitative determination of unglycosylated human interferon beta .
