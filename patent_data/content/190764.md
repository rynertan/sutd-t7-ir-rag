# Process and system for disposing of radioactive liquid waste.

## Abstract
The process of the present invention comprises adding an alkaline earth metal hydroxide 2 such as barium hydroxide to a radioactive liquid waste 1 containing sodium sulfate as the main component to convert the latter into an insoluble alkaline earth metal salt 4 such as barium sulfate, adding silicic acid 3 to by product sodium hydroxide to prepare water glass and solidifying the radioactive insoluble alkaline earth metal salt 17 with the water glass. According to this process, exudation of radioactive substances from the solid can be prevented and the solid having a high durability can be obtained at a low cost.
