# A LOCK

## Abstract
A lock comprising a lock bolt, a handle, a bolt actuator 3 which effects movement of the lock bolt, an actuator operating member 8 and a lock control system 9 19 the actuator operating member 8 operating the bolt actuator 3 upon movement of the handle and under the control of the lock control system 9 19 , the lock control system 9 19 including a solenoid 15 and a solenoid energization circuit 17 19 , the solenoid energization circuit 17 19 including a switch circuit 18 which operates to energize the solenoid 13 upon verification of an input code with a present code, characterised by the lock control system 9 19 having a control member 11 which is held against movement by the solenoid 15 when energized, whereby the control member 11 permits the actuator operating member 8 to operate the bolt actuator 3 to move the lock bolt with the control member 11 disabling the actuator operating member 8 when the solenoid 15 is not energised.
