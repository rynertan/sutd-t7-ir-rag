# CLUTCH THROW OUT BEARING AND BEARING CARRIER ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A clutch release bearing 10 and bearing carrier assem bly 12 comprising a support flange 18 proximate an end of the carrier member, and a pair of resiliently flexible lugs 56 on the bearing housing face in engagement with the carrier flange disposed each in pocket 66 formed in the peripheral surface of the carrier proximate the flange such as to retain the bearing in assembly with the carrier while permitting limited radial motion of the bearing relative to the carrier for self alignment and preventing rotational motion of the bearing housing relative to the carrier. An elastomeric cushion 74 is preferably disposed on the surface of the carrier flange for permitting limited angular axial alignment of the bearing with the axis of rotation of the clutch.
