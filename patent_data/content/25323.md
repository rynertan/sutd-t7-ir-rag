# A shift circuit.

## Abstract
The shift system has rotate parts 12 1 and 12 2 which take divided input data from divided input parts 9 1 and 9 2. Each rotate part 12 1, 12 2 is selectively operable to rotate the divided input data fed thereto and place the rotated data in rotate part outputs 10 1 and 10 2. Select parts 14 1, 14 2 place a selection from the rotated data in rotate part outputs 10 1 and 10 2 in select part output 11, which selection corresponds to the input data shifted by a selected amount. When the rotate parts 12 1, 12 2 rotate data by multiples of 2
