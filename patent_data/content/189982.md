# Circularly polarizing antenna feed.

## Abstract
A circularly polarizing antenna feed comprises a feed waveguide 1 having a short circuit reflecting plate 2 at one end and a radiating horn 3 at the other, a wave exciter 4 for launching nearly polarized plane waves axially along the feed waveguide 1 in opposite directions, and a grid of parallel reflector strips 5 disposed in a plane which is perpendicular to the waveguide axis 7 and which is located between the wave exciter 4 and the reflecting termination 2 at a distance of approximately 位g 8 from the exciter 4 and approximately 位g 4 from the termination 2 The reflecting strips of the grid 5 are inclined at an angle of 45 to the direction of polarization of the waves propagated by the exciter 4 , the grid 5 and the reflecting termination 2 together forming a twist reflector which effectively reflects and rotates through 90 the waves incident upon the grid 5 . These reflected waves together with the forwardly prop agated waves from the exciter 4 represent circularly polarized waves. As an alternative to the reflector grid 5 the feed may comprise a metal septum plate which has an axial length of 位g 4 and which is disposed in the waveguide 1 in an axial plane inclined at 45 to the polarization direction of waves propagated by the exciter 4 and so that its front edge is located 位g 8 behind the exciter.
