# Method of selecting recombinant dna containing streptomyces.

## Abstract
A novel method of selecting Streptomyces recombinant DNA containing host cells and vectors useful in the method are described. The vectors conver tylosin resistance to sensitive Streptomyces host cells and thus provide a conve nient method of selecting Streptomyces transformants. The novel tylosin resistance conferring gene described can be isolated on an 2.6 kb Kpnl restriction fragment from plasmid pSVB2. Plasmid pSVB2 can be isolated from Strep tomyces lividans TK23 pSVB2 NRRL 15880 .
