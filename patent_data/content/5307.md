# Method and apparatus for making variegated glass in a continuous, elongate sheet form.

## Abstract
A molten glass confluent 24 comprising discrete domains of differently coloured glasses is formed by combining differently coloured viscous molten glass streams 15 and 17 in a forehearth 18 and is pressed into a continuous sheet of variegated glass by rollers 42 and 44 . The molten glass of the confluent 24 is stirred, firstly, coarsely by reciprocating a paddle 36 then by injecting gas bubbles into it from below and, finally, finely by manipulating a puddle 40 in a non synchronous mixing pattern. Flow of the confluent 24 to the rollers 42 and 44 is partially obstructed by a weir 50 so that a reservoir of molten glass develops behind the weir 50 . The reservoir is a source of supplemental glass for use as needed to compensate for transient shortfalls in the quantity of glass reaching the rollers 42 and 44 .
