# A PROCESS FOR PROCESSING A MOIST METAL OR METAL COMPOUNDS CONTAINING COMPOSITION COMPRISING AT LEAST ON SOLID PRODUCT SEPARATED FROM GASES EVOLVED DURING THE PREPARATION OF IRON

## Abstract
A waste sludge as obtained from gases evolved during steel preparation in converters by blowing oxygen through said liquid steel is mixed with fly ash thereby forming particulate material. Preferably the final products contain 25 35 of fly ash and at most 5 of a curing activator. The hardness of the particles may be improved by moistening the surface of the particles with water.
