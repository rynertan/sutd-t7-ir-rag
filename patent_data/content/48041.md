# Method and apparatus for writing a signal information track by using a radiation beam.

## Abstract
This invention relates to an apparatus and process for writing video information in the form of a frequency modulated signal upon a video disc member and for recovering the video information from the video record is described. The video disc member 10 formed by the writing apparatus is also described. The writing apparatus includes a laser 30 as a source of a laser write beam 29 and a write optical system 40 for directing the stationary laser write beam to a moving video disc member. The video disc member comprises a substrate member carrying a light responsive coating 26 at least one surface. The write optical system focuses the beam to a small spot of light approxi mately one micron in diameter upon the light responsive layer. The intensity of the focused spot is changeable under the control of a light intensity modulating assembly 44 . This light intensity modulator changes the intensity of the write laser beam with respect to a predetermined threshold intensity sufficient to form a first type of indicia 37 in the coating. A read system 165 is employed to retrieve the video signal stored on the video disc member. This read system includes a read laser 150 for generating a read beam, and a motion control assembly for rotating and translating the video disc member relative to the read light beam. A read optical system directs the read beam to impinge upon the successively positioned specular light reflective and non specular light reflective regions 37,38 carried by the video disc member. The read optical system also collects the light 150 reflected from these regions. The reflected light beam is intensity modulated by the specular light reflective and non specular light reflective regions. The read optical system also directed the reflected light beam to a light sensing circuit for changing the intensity modulated reflected light beam to a corresponding frequency mod ulated electrical signal 165 which is representative of the video signal stored on the video disc member. Circuitry is described for using a triangular frequency modulator for driving a Pockels Cell 68 and for obtaining a sinusoidal shaped light modulation output signal from the linear polariser 70 The output from the linear polariser is adjusted such that the half power point from the polariser equals the threshold power level of the material forming the information storage layer. A second harmonic bias circuit 264 is employed for removing the second harmonic intermodulation distortion of the modulated write beam.
