The top part 14 of the plastic bag 10 is provided with a carrying aperture 16 or equivalent and the bottom with a filling valve 18 or equivalent for filling the plastic bag 10 with bulk goods. The top part 14 of the plastic bag 10 has been formed with the aid of a transversal seam 12 and a reinforcing patch 15 attached to the top part 14 . The reinforcing patch 15 is attached on one side of the top part 14 , whereby the top part 14 is composed of three thicknesses of material, or a reinforcing patch 15 is attached on both sides of the top part 14 , whereby the top part 14 is composed of four thicknesses of material. The top part 14 of a plastic bag 10 intended for a larger quantity of bulk goods is folded at least once before attaching the reinforcing patch 15 , whereby the top part 14 is composed of at least five thicknesses of material.
