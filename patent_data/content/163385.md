# Process for producing synthesis gas by partial combustion of hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
Process for the production of synthesis gas and higher hydrocarbons in which a saturated hydrocarbon and an oxygen containing gas having a ratio of hydrocarbon to oxygen of greater than the stoichiometric ratio for complete combustion are introduced into a bed of an inert particulate material. The upward flow rate of the hydrocarbon oxygen containing gas stream is sufficient to fluidise or to produce a spouting action of the bed material, whereby the particulate material is thrown up above the bed surface and subsequent ly falls back into the bed. The hydrocarbon and oxygen containing gas are ignited and reacted together, and the products of the reaction withdrawn.
