# Method and system for controlling an AC DC converter system.

## Abstract
In control of an AC DC converter system including AC DC converters 1A, 1B having respective AC terminals con nected to AC power systems 6A, 6B and having respective DC terminals connected to each other, a fault in the AC power systems is detected, and upon occurrence of a fault in any of the AC power systems, the DC current of the AC DC con verter which is connected to the sound AC power system is adjusted in such a manner as to maintain the AC voltage of the AC DC converter which is connected to the sound AC power system at a desired value.
