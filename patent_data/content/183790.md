EP A 0 107 915 is concerning a moisture vapour permeable, adhesive surgical dressing which comprises a continuous film of a hydrophilic polymer which has a moisture vapour permeability which is greater when in contact with water than when not in contact with water and which is attached around its edges to a water transmitting film so as to form a sealed portion into which exudate may pass from an exuding wound. The hydrophilic polymer may consist of a polyurethane prepared by reacting polyethylene glycol, polytetramethylene glycol, ethane diol and 4,4 dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate. US Patent 4,052,495 describes a method of obtaining release of polyurethane polymers from various substrates by adding siloxane polyoxyalkylene copolymers comprising OH groups to the reaction mixture comprising polyols and polyisocyanates. It is an object of the invention to provide nonporous uniform films and coatings of segmented block copolymers which can be used as wound dressings or coatings for textiles with high impermeability to liquid water, high permeability to water vapor, high textile strength and elongation and high soil release properties. The present invention is directed to a moisture vapor permeable material in the form of a nonporous uniform film or coating of a thickness less than 127 µm, said film or coating is obtained by using a solution of the material in an organic solvent and evaporating the solvent, said material comprising a segmented block multipolymer and optionally a base polymer, said segmented multipolymer comprising an essentially linear hard segment copolymer chain characterized by at least one polyurethane or polyurethane urea hard segment and at least one copolymer soft block comprising polyoxytetramethylene oxide and polydialkylsiloxane as hydrophobic and polyethylene oxide as hydrophilic components. The materials according to the present invention will usually be formed by admixing a base polymer and a segmented block multipolymer additive in a solution and casting the admixture as a film. Removing the solvent by evaporative procedures will result in a material having a high moisture vapor capability. When used without a base polymer, the block multipolymer will usually be dissolved in a solvent, then cast as a film or coating. This method is particularly preferred for forming moisture vapor permeable coatings on textiles. As used herein, the term base polymer will refer to the polymer whose moisture vapor transmission characteristics are modified by the block multipolymer additive. Such base polymers may be segmented or block copolymers, blends thereof, thermoplastic homopolymers, or homopolymer mixtures which may also contain plasticizing agents. For example, plasticized polyvinylchloride and polyethylene may be used as base polymers. Typical base polymers which may be utilized according to the present invention include polyurethanes, polysulfones, polyesters, polyethylenes, polypropylenes, polystyrenes, poly acrylonitrile butadienestyrene , polybutadiene, polyisoprene, styrene butadiene styrene block copolymers, styrene isoprene styrene block copolymers, poly 4 methylpentene , polyisobutylene, polymethylmethacrylate, polyvinylacetate, polyacrylonitrile, polyvinylchloride, polyethylene terephthalate, cellulose and its esters or derivatives. The term segmented refers to the relatively short length of repeating units, e.g., less than about ten monomeric units, but preferably less than three monomeric units, typically alternating more than once, with structural formulas, such as ABAB. A preferred class of base polymers includes the polyurethanes, including polyether urethane ureas, polyether urethanes and polyester urethanes. The polyurethanes or polyurethane ureas may be the reaction products of polymeric ether glycols and a diisocyanate, and a chain extending diamine or dihydroxy derivative. By the use of various types of isocyanates e.g. aliphatic or aromatic , glycols e.g. polyethylene, polypropylene, or polytetramethylene oxides , and chain extenders aliphatic or aromatic , the structural properties of the base polymer may be varied depending upon the end use of the material. A particularly preferred base polymer is a polyurethane urea formed from the polymerization of diphenylmethane diisocyanate MDI , ethylene diamine ED , and polytetramethylene oxide PTMO . Other base polymers include polyester polyethers, polyesters, polyether polyamides, polyamides, styrene isoprenes, styrene butadienes, thermoplastic polyolefins, styrene saturated olefins, copolyesters, ethylene vinyl acetate, ethylene ethyl acrylate, ionomers, thermoplastic polydienes. The segmented block multipolymers according to the present invention comprise an essentially linear segmented copolymer chain characterized by at least one polyurethane or polyurethane urea hard segment and at least one copolymer soft block comprising polyoxytetramethylene oxide and polydialkylsiloxane as hydrophobic and polyethylene oxide as hydrophilic components. The hard segment may be relatively short in length, typically including from one to ten repeating units. Preferably, the hard block will be a homopolymer wherein the hard segments comprise urethane selected from the same polymers which comprise the preferred polyurethane urea base polymers. When the segmented block multipolymer is used as an additive the similarity of the urethane segments of the additive and the urethane of the base polymer will cause the additive to be at least partially compatible with the base polymer in the admixture. The copolymer soft block s of the block multipolymer are comprising both hydrophobic and hydrophilic components. The hydrophobic components of the soft block are consisting of polytetraalkylene oxide and a polydialkylsiloxane. Techniques for forming siloxane copolymers are known, e.g., as described by Noll, Chemistry and Technology of Silicones Academic Press, 1968 , disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. The hard segments preferably comprise condensation products of diphenylmethane diisocyanate MDI with a diamine or diol. A particularly preferred hard segment will contain hard segments of MDI and ethylene diamine. A particularly preferred composition of the first class will comprise the following The amounts of each of the block multipolymer additives which will be added to the base polymer, when used, will depend upon the base polymer and additives which are used. Generally, the organic polymer additive will be added in an amount to achieve a silicone concentration of at least 0.5 by weight in the admixture containing both base polymer and additive. In the above concentration ranges, the additives according to the present invention will cause an increase of the moisture vapor transmission rate of the base polymer by about 10 to 500 , when cast in films ranging in thickness from 12.7 µm 0.5 mil to 50.8 µm 2.0 mil . To cast the films, the base polymer will normally be dissolved in an appropriate solvent, such as dimethylacetamide DMAC , dimethylformamide DMF , toluene isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran THF . The additives will then be added and the film will be cast according to conventional procedures onto a support. Upon evaporation of the solvent a film will remain comprising materials according to the present invention. Similar methods may also be utilized to form thermoplastic films. The base polymers utilized according to the present invention may be those conventionally known in the art, i.e. polyurethanes, polyetherurethaneureas, polyetherurethanes, polyesterurethanes, polyester polyether, thermoplastic elastomers, many of which are commercially available as Estanes B.F. Goodrich Company , Pellethane Upjohn , Hytrel and Lycra Spandex DuPont . The segmented block multipolymers according to the present invention may be suitably formed of block copolymers of alternating hard segment and soft block components interlinked by chemical bond in accordance with the method set forth by Noshay and McGrath, Block Copolymers Overview and Critical Survey Academic Press 1977 . A suitable number of repeating units of each polymer of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic soft block components will typically be on the order of 1 to 100 units. The procedure for preparation of the segmented block multipolymer additive may be performed by several procedures which differ in the degree to which the structure of the resultant product may be defined. One procedure involves a coupling of two or more preformed blocks or segments which are prepared in separate reactions prior to the coupling reaction. This procedure involves a well defined structure if the coupling reaction precludes like blocks or segments from reacting with themselves, but only allows dissimilar blocks or segments to couple to one another. Other coupling reactions may occur resulting in a less defined structure of the two preformed blocks or segments possess the ability via the coupling reaction to react with themselves as well as the dissimilar block or segment. Additional coupling reactions may occur when a single or more preformed block or segment is coupled with a second block or segment created during the coupling reaction. In this case the initial length of the preformed block or segment is known, by virtue of their separate reaction used to prepare but the sequence of the distribution of the copolymer is not known exactly since both coupling and chain growth is possible in the reaction. Suitable methods of forming these and other such copolymers for use in the present invention are set forth in the aforementioned Noshay and McGrath publication. A typical procedure is given below The above preferred additive will be used in the preferred base polymer, which is a low durometer polyurethaneurea based on diphenylmethane diisocyanate MDI , ethylenediamine ED and polytetramethylene oxide PTMO . A typical procedure is outlined below. Charge a stirred, dry nitrogen purged reaction vessel with 8.60 g 0.034 moles diphenylmethane diisocyanate, 50.0 g 0.025 moles polytetramethylene oxide, and 100 ml anhydrous dimethylformamide at 45 C. Maintain the 45 C temperature for 1 hour, 15 minutes. Remove the heat, dilute the mixture with 200 additional ml anhydrous dimethylformamide, and add 0.54 g 0.009 moles ethylene diamine incrementally over a 20 minute period. Typically, the base polymer will be dissolved in the solvent, preferably dimethylacetamide, and the additives will be added to the solution based on the weight of the base polymer. The amount of solvent which is used will depend at least in part on the thickness of the desired film. The thicknesses of the films which are desired will depend upon the ultimate use to which the film will be utilized. The compatibility between the base polymer and the organic polymer additive may be controlled by using a constant silicone soft segment and varying the chemistry of the remainder of the components of the admixture. Therefore, if the base polymer is Estane 5714, the additive may be a polymer containing a low molecular weight silicone with the remainder of the additive comprising MDI, butanediol, and PTMO. On the other hand, using the same silicone content in a copolymer or a polymer additive containing ethylene diamine, polybutylene adipate and MDI may give a different compatibility with the same Estane 5714 base polymer at equivalent concentrations. Therefore, the choice of the amounts and types of additives and base polymers which are utilized according to their present ivention may be readily determined to achieve the most effective MVTR according to the teachings of the present invention. Wound dressings comprising a nonporous uniform film according to the present invention may be made which have high elongation and excellent tear propagation so that the films may be stretched over joints and limbs to conform to parts of the body, while retaining the capability of being intentionally torn or cut without propagating rips across the dressing. A particularly preferable wound dressing material may comprise a polyether polyester elastomer commercially available under the name Hytrel DuPont as the base polymer. Textiles coated with a material according to the present invention will have low permeability to liquid water, high permeability to water vapor, high tensile strength and elongation. Generally, fabrics will be coated with a composition comprising either a segmented block multipolymer or a mixture of a base polymer and block multipolymer additive by conventional coating techniques. The compositions according to the present invention are particularly advantageous as fabric coatings due to excellent adhesive properties, and lack of tackiness which allows the coated fabrics to be easily sewn. In addition, the viscosity of the bulk composition is in the range which permits easy handling for coating techniques. Finally, the coated fabrics have a pleasing texture and are more cloth like in feel than conventional water impermeable synthetic materials which characteristically have boardy texture. While not intending to limit the invention by a particular theory, it is believed that commercially available water impermeable coated textiles are microporous while the coated textiles according to the present invention form a substantially solid sheet of water vapor permeable material to give a pleasing cloth like texture while improving the soil release and liquid water impermeability. Coated fabrics according to the present invention are useful as rainwear, uphostery, shoe tops, tablecloths, tarpaulines, protective interliners for clothing proofed against chemical agents, and similar uses where liquid, e.g., water impermeability and water vapor permeability is desired. Having described the preferred embodiments, the following examples are presented, but the invention is not intended to be limited thereto. Fisher Payne Permeability cups were used to determine the moisture vapor transmission rate MVTR of the test specimens. Ten milliliters of distilled water was dispensed into the flanged cup. A disk of the sample was placed over the cup flange followed by a butyl rubber sealing gasket and a metal flat ring. The sample, gasket and ring were secured to the cup flange with three clamps with sufficient pressure to insure a tight seal. The MVTR of the unsupported cast films were determined by the standard test conditions of ASTM E 96, procedure BW. This procedure involved testing the material at 23 1 C and 50 2 relative humidity. The cup was inverted allowing the distilled water to cover the inner surface of the film. Air was continuously circulated over the face of the inverted cup at 152 m min. 500 ft min. . The samples were conditioned for 24 hours at 23 C and 50 RH prior to testing. The MVTR of five specimens from each cast film were measured. The assembled cups were placed in the test chambers for one hour. The temperature, air velocity and relative humidity were recorded. At the end of this time period, each cup was accurately weighed to 0.1 mg. The cups were inverted and returned to the test chamber for two hours and reweighed. The MVTR of each cup was calculated from equation 1 . Each film was analyzed on three separate days to determine the reproducibility of the coating and testing methods.
