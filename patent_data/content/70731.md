# Method of supplying a fine particle powder.

## Abstract
A fine particle powder from a container 100 to an apparatus through an opening therein, which comprises causing an engagement portion formed in part of the container to cooperate with an engagement portion formed in the apparatus adjacent to the opening e.g. in the outer machine frame of an electrostatic recording apparatus whereby the fine particles powder can spontaneously be moved e.g. to a hopper 5 while the container is maintained stationary. The method makes it possible to supply toner without contamination of the hands and garments of an operator. The container can positively be held and fixed by the engagement of the container with the body of the apparatus. Further, the scattering and floating toner particles can be completely prevented from leaking.
