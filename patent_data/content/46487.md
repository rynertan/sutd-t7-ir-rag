# A DISK BUBBLE DEVICE

## Abstract
A propagation pattern for contiguous disk bubble de vices includes a first propagation track 22A having cusps on first 24A and second 24A sides, said cusps on said second side being shifted by about half of a period relative to said cusps on said first side and a second propagation track 22B having cusps on first 24B and second 24B sides, said cusps on said second side being shifted by about half of a period relative to the cusps on said first side and said second track 22B being shifted longitudinally by about half of a period relative to said first track 22A .
