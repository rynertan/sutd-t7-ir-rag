# SHOCK SENSOR SWITCH

## Abstract
A vibration sensitive switch has a pair of spaced apart parallel contacts 4 housed in a switch body 1,2,3 and a movably supported activated mass 5 inside a chamber 6 in the body. The mass 5 is supported by contact bridging means in the form of a pair of bars 14, 16 secured in the mass and located between the two contacts 4 with the centre of gravity Cg of the mass 5 spaced from the points of contact between the contacts 4 and the bars so that bars are urged against the contacts 4 by a lever action as a result of the gravitational force acting on the mass 5 . The forces at the contact points are thus greater than that which would be obtained by simply allowing the mass to rest on the contacts, which enables a relatively small mass to be used having a greater sensitivity to high frequency vibrations.
