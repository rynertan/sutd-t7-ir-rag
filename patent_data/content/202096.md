# Residual current detector.

## Abstract
A residual current detector capable of detecting an earth leakage current, e.g. for use in a circuit breaker, includes a toroidal core 2 through which passes the live and neutral wires 3, 4 of an electrical installation, to form the primary windings of a differential transformer. At least one secondary winding 5,6 is wound on to the core 2 and driven with an alternating voltage by a generator 7 . A phase sensitive tector 11 identifies a residual current by detecting the change in phase of the voltage across the at least one secon dary winding 5, 6 . The secondary winding may comprise two coils, a first coil 5 driven by the generator 7 and a second coil 6 adapted to pick up an induced voltage from the toroidal core 2 . The phase sensitive detector 11 , which may form part of a phase locked loop 30 , compares the phase of the signal from the second coil 6 with that of the alternating voltage of the generator 7 .
