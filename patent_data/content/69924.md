# Computed tomography system cable retractor.

## Abstract
A cable retractor for a computed tomography scanner that is driven with a motor and a belt through two revolutions between clockwise and counterclockwise limits about a horizontal axis. An inner drum is fixed on the scanner for rotation therewith and a stationary outer drum is concentric to the inner drum. Cables are fastened where they enter the outer drum and exit the inner drum on their way to the scanner. A loop is formed in the cable in the circular channel defined by the concentric drums to provide enough cable length for the scanner to make two revolutions. A disk facing the channel is journalled for rotation on the inner drum. Pulleys extend axially from the disk to support the cable loop. The disk is belt driven so its angular motion is a constant fraction of the motion of the scanner whereby the pulleys move at the same rate as the loop to keep it supported as cable is reeled between the drums. Solenoid operated latching levers assure stopping the scanner rota tion before the cables would be overstressed.
