# LAMP ENVELOPE WITH IMPROVED RESISTANCE TO SOLARIZATION AND LAMPS MADE THEREFROM

## Abstract
A lamp envelope is fabricated from a soda lime silicate glass containing an effective amount of cerium oxide or a compound thermally decomposable to cerium oxide at temp eratures below about 1450 C to inhibit solarization of the glass under the influence of ultraviolet radiation having a wavelength equal to or less than 254 nanometers and lamps made from same.
