# Controlling the circulating current in naturally commutated static power converters.

## Abstract
A power converter for producing a desired waveform from AC power supply, uses naturally commutated thyristors arranged in positive and negative banks. The firing pulses to the nonload carrying bank only of the naturally commutated thyristor power circuit of the static power converter are retarded to reduce or eliminate the interbank circulating current. In one form of the invention, half wave rectified load current signals are summed with the output waveform reference signal applied to the positive and negative bank firing pulse generators in a sense to retard the pulses in the nonload carrying bank. In another form of the invention, inversion end stops are used to generate the retarded firing pulses in the nonload carrying bank.
