# Catalyst system and process for polymerizing conjugated dienes.

## Abstract
Conjugated dienes, in particular 1,3 conjugated dienes can be polymerized or copolymerized using the catalyst system of this invention to polymers wherein the amount of 1,2 structure contained in the polymer is increased, and polymers can be prepared containing varying amounts of 1,2 structure as desired. Such desirable results can be obtained in accordance with the process of the present invention for polymerizing conjugated diene monomers which comprises the use of a catalyst system which compris es a at least one anionic initiator based on lithium, and b a modifier composition comprising at least one cyclic acetal of a glyoxal. In another embodiment, the catalyst system also con tains at least one coinitiator selected from the group consisting of organomagnesium compounds, organoalumi num compounds, or mixtures thereof.
