# Color changeable fabric.

## Abstract
A fabric 2 formed from fiber like strands 4 of hollow, transparent filaments which have been woven or otherwise joined together is disclosed. The hollow strands contain a liquid in which color coded micromagnets 8 are dispersed. The micromagnets are free to rotate within the filament, the fabric 2 thereby being capable of changing colors, either selectively or totally, when an activating magnetic force causes the micromagnets 8 therein to rotate. The fabric 2 may incorporate, in place of color coded micromagnets 8 , other orientable bodies which are also capable of being oriented, as for example by an electromagnetic or electrosta tic force field, to produce a visual display. Further, the fabric may comprise a material having one or more liquid filled veins, the liquid again containing color coded micromagnets or orientable bodies dispersed therein.
