# Method for the preparation of aldehydes.

## Abstract
An improved process for the dehydrogenation of alco hols, to produce aldehydes therefrom, using a copper containing catalyst, is described wherein the alcohol is introduced in the gas phase initially in admixture with an inert gas only, and after an initial reaction period the alcohol is continued to be introduced, in the gas phase, in an admixture with an inert gas together with a minor amount of hydrogen. As a result, prolonged catalyst activity with retained selectivity is achieved.
