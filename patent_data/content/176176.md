# METHODS FOR STABILIZING SWELLING CLAYS OR MIGRATING FINES IN SUBTERRANEAN FORMATIONS

## Abstract
A method of preventing or reducing the migration of fines and or the swelling of clays in a permeable subterra nean formation, comprising contacting said fines or clays with an effective amount of an organic polycationic polymer having a molecular weight in the range of from about 50,000 to about 300,000 and having monomer units of the formula
