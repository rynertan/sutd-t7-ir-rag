# Automotive suspension control system with road condition dependent damping characteristics.

## Abstract
A suspension control system for automotive vehicles automatically adusts the damping strength of variable shock absorbers or other dampers in accordance with road surface conditions as recognized by frequency analysis of a vehicle height or vibration sensor signal. The sensor signal reflects vertical displacement of the vehicle body from the road surface and includes high frequency components due solely to displacement of the wheels or unsprung mass relative to the road surface and low frequency components due to displacement of the vehicle body or sprung mass. The sensor signal is filtered into these separate frequency bands, the amplitude of each of which is compared to a correspond ing reference level. The results of comparison give an indication of the degree and scale of irregularities in the road surface specifically, a high amplitude low frequency com ponent indicates larger scale bumps and dips capable of bouncing the vehicle whereas a strong high frequency component reflects a rough textured road surface, such as gravel. The comparison information is sent to a suspension system controller which causes actuation of the shock absorbers to a stiffer mode of operation when the low frequency sensor signal components are relatively strong.
