## Description
The invention relates to a process for the carbonylation of allenically unsaturated compounds with carbon monoxide in the presence of water, an alcohol and or a carboxylic acid. It is known that allenes may be carbonylated in the presence of water or alcohols to yield carboxylic acids or esters, respectively. However, the known processes have various drawbacks which render them rather unattractive for use on a technical scale. British patent specification 1,110,405 describes carbonylation of allene in the presence of a palladium halide and an organic phosphine. British patent specification 1,123,367 describes carbonylation of polyolefinically unsaturated compounds in the presence of a palladium chalcogenide, an organic phosphine and an acid. The necessity of using extremely high partial pressures of carbon monoxide is a disadvantage of these known processes. European patent application 106,379 describes carbonylation of olefinically unsaturated compounds having two double bonds in the presence of a palladium catalyst, at least 5 mol of a triarylphosphine per gram atom palladium and an acid having a pK It has now surprisingly been found that allenically unsaturated compounds are rapidly carbonylated at relatively low pressure by using a catalytic system in which protonic acids having a pK The invention, therefore, provides a process for the carbonylation of allenically unsaturated compounds with carbon monoxide in the presence of water, an alcohol and or a carboxylic acid, which process is carried out in the presence of a catalytic system formed by combining Surprisingly, it has furthermore been found that the process according to the present invention exhibits a very high selectivity to carboxylic acids, esters or carboxylic anhydrides, starting from water, alcohols or carboxylic acids, respectively. The selectivity to a certain compound expressed in a percentage is defined as Both homogeneous and heterogeneous palladium catalysts may be used in the process according to the invention. Homogeneous catalysts are preferred. Suitable homogeneous catalysts are the salts of palladium with, for example, nitric acid, sulphuric acid or alkanoic acids having not more than 12 carbon atoms per molecule. Salts of hydrohalogenic acids may, in principle, be used as well, but they have the drawback that the halogen ion may have a corrosive effect. A palladium compound used by preference is palladium acetate. Moreover, palladium complexes may be used, for instance palladium acetylacetonate, tetrakistriphenylphosphinepalladium, bis tri o tolylphosphinepalladium acetate or bistriphenylphosphinepalladium sulphate. Palladium bonded to an ion exchanger for instance an ion exchanger comprising sulphonic acid groups is an example of a suitable heterogeneous catalyst. Mixtures of two or more compounds of divalent palladium may be used. The organic phosphine may be primary, secondary or, which is preferred, tertiary. Suitable phosphines include those of the general formula I An optionally substituted alkylene group formed by R² and R³ suitably has in the range of from 4 to 9 and particularly from 6 to 8 carbon atoms, and such a group may form a monocyclic or a bicyclic ring containing the phosphorous atom. An example of such a compound is Another preferred group of organic phosphines are those of the general formula I in which R³ represents a chain of carbon atoms ending with the group PR⁴ R⁵, in which R⁴ represents an optionally substituted phenyl group and R⁵ an optionally substituted alkyl, optionally substituted cycloalkyl or optionally substituted phenyl group. Within this group R¹ and R² preferably represent an optionally substituted phenyl group. Preferred compounds are 1,5 di diphenylphosphino pentane and 1,6 di diphenylphosphino hexane. Preferably, R⁴ and R⁵ are equal to R¹ and R², respectively. The chain of carbon atoms suitably comprises 2 to 6 carbon atoms and preferably comprises 2 to 6 methylene groups. Any aryl group present in the organic phosphine of the catalytic system may carry an electron donating substituent, such as an alkyl group, a p alkoxy group para with respect to the carbon phosphorous bond and a dialkylamino group. The alkyl groups and p alkoxy groups preferably have no more than 5 carbon atoms examples of such groups are methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec butyl and tert butyl groups. An example of a suitable phosphine is tri p methoxyphenyl phosphine. The phosphines used in the process according to the invention may carry electron withdrawing substituents on any aryl group. Examples of electron withdrawing substituents are halogen atoms and m alkoxy and halomethyl groups, halo referring to iodo, bromo, chloro and fluoro the halomethyl groups include mono , di and trihalomethyl groups. Very good results have been obtained with tri p chlorophenyl phosphine in combination with orthophosphoric acid. Other examples of suitable phosphines are phenyldiethylphosphine, ethyldiphenylphosphine, phenyldipropylphosphine, propyldiphenylphoshine, tri o tolylphosphine, phenyl di butylphosphine, diphenylmethylphosphine, tricyclohexylphosphine, tri n butylphosphine and tri n octylphosphine. Further examples of suitable phosphines are 1,2 di diphenylphosphino ethane, 1,2 di diphenylphosphino ethene, 1,2 di diphenylphosphino ethyne, 1,2 di diphenylphosphino benzene, 1,2 diphenylphosphino tetrafluoro 1,2 cyclobutene, 1,2 diphenylphosphino hexafluoro 1,2 cyclopentene, 1,2 diphenylphosphino octafluoro 1,2 cyclohexene, 1,4 diphenyl 1,4 diphosphacyclohexane, bis o diphenylphosphinophenyl phenylphosphine and tris o diphenylphosphinophenyl phosphine. Mixtures of two or more organic phosphines may be used. The protonic acid having a pK Mixtures of two or more protonic acids having a pK Modifying the process according to the present invention by using less than 15 mol organic phoshine per gram atom palladium results in a very low reaction rate and a decreased selectivity to carboxylic acids, esters or carboxylic anhydrides. Preferably in the range of from 20 to 500 mol of organic phosphine are used per gram atom of palladium use of more than 500 mol is, however, not excluded. The quantity of the compound of divalent palladium is not critical. Preference is given to the use of quantities in the range between 10 ⁵ and 10 ¹ gram atom palladium per mol of allenically unsaturated compound. The number of equivalents of the organic phosphine which is used per equivalent of protonic acid is not critical and may vary between wide limits. Suitably, in the range of from 0.2 to 50 equivalents of the organic phosphine are used per equivalent of the protonic acid. A separate solvent is not essential in the process according to the invention, and often a large excess of one of the reactants, usually the alcohol, may form a convenient liquid phase. However, it may in some cases be desirable to use a separated solvent and any inert solvent may be used. A suitable solvent may for example be selected from sulphoxides and sulphones, for example dimethyl sulphoxide, diisopropyl sulphone or tetrahydrothiophene 1,1 dioxide also referred to as sulfolane and ethers. Very good results have been obtained with ethers, in particular with anisole, 2,5,8 trioxanonane also referred to as diglyme and diphenyl ether. Another example of a suitable ether is diisopropyl ether. The process according to the invention permits the use of very mild reaction conditions. Temperatures in the range of from 50 C to 200 C, especially 100 C to 150 C, are generally suitable. The pressure may vary over a wide range. Generally, a pressure in the range of from 1 to 100 bar is suitable, with pressures of from 5 to 50 bar being preferred. Pressures higher than 100 bar may be used, but are usually economically unattractive. The molar ratio of alcohol or water or carboxylic acid to allenically unsaturated bonds is not critical, may vary between wide limits and is generally in the range of from 0.1 1 to 10 1. The process according to the invention may be carried out using a wide variety of allenically unsaturated compounds and it is not excluded that such compounds carry one or more substituents which are inert under the reaction conditions, such as halogen atoms and cyano, ester, alkoxy and aryl groups. In addition, the allenically unsaturated compound may contain one or more substituents which are not inert under the reaction conditions, for example hydroxy groups. The fate of such groups will depend on the precise reaction conditions. One or more allenically unsaturated bonds may be present in any position in the carbon chain. Very good results have been obtained with unsubstituted alkadienes, particularly with those having up to 20 carbon atoms per molecule, more particularly with allene. Other examples of suitable allenes are 1,2 butadiene, 1,2 pentadiene, 3,4 octadiene and 3 methyl 1,2 butadiene. The allenically unsaturated compound may be used pure, diluted with an inert compound or diluted with a compound which is not inert under the reaction conditions. An example of the latter case is a mixture of an allenically and an acetylenically unsaturated compound, such as allene mixed with propyne, as becomes available by cracking of hydrocarbons in the presence of steam for the production of ethylene. Acetylenically and ethylenically unsaturated compounds are both carboxylated when the organic phosphine is a phosphine of the general formula I in which any aryl group is unsubstituted or carries an electro donating substituent and the protonic acid is a non carboxylic protonic acid having a pK A wide range of alcohols may be used as reactant in the process of the invention. For example, the alcohol may be aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic, and may carry one or more inert substituents, for example halogen atoms and cyano, ester, alkoxy and aryl groups. The alcohol suitably contains up to 20 carbon atoms per molecule. One or more hydroxy groups may be present, in which case different products can be obtained as desired, depending upon the molar ratio of reactants used. For example, a trihydric alcohol can be reacted with a small quantity of allenically unsaturated compound to produce a mono ester, or with a large quantity of allenically unsaturated compound to produce a tri ester. Thus the choice of alcohol depends solely on the desired product. The use of water produces alpha beta unsaturated carboxylic acids as the initial product. The use of alcohols produces alpha beta unsaturated esters, and these can of course be poly esters as described above. Alkanols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isobutanol, tert. butanol, stearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, cyclohexanol, allyl alcohol, chlorocapryl alcohol, ethylene glycol, 1,2 dihydroxypropane, 1,4 dihydroxybutane, glycerol, 1,6 hexanediol, phenol or 2,2 dihydroxymethyl 1 butanol, and alcohols containing ether linkages, for example triethylene glycol, all may be used. A wide range of carboxylic acids may be used as a reactant in the process according to the invention. This carboxylic acid may be the same as or different from the protonic acid having a pK In the process according to the invention the carbon monoxide may be used pure or diluted with an inert gas, such as nitrogen, noble gases or carbon dioxide. Generally, the presence of more than 10 v of hydrogen is undesirable, since under the reaction conditions it may cause hydrogenation of the allenically unsaturated compound. Generally preference is given to the use of carbon monoxide or a carbon monoxide containing gas which contains less than 5 by volume of hydrogen. The following Examples further illustrate the invention. A 250 ml magnetically stirred Hastelloy C autoclave Hastelloy is a trade mark was charged with 10 ml methanol, 40 ml of a solvent and with palladium acetate, a phosphine and a protonic acid if any . The Table hereinafter states which solvent, phosphine and protonic acid was used and the quantities of each of the three catalyst components. The autoclave was flushed with carbon monoxide, pressurized with allene till a partial allene pressure of 2 bar was reached and with carbon monoxide till a partial pressure of 20 bar was reached, sealed and heated to a temperature of 115 C. After the reaction time stated in the Table the contents of the autoclave were analysed by means of gas liquid chromatography. The reaction rates and selectivities to methyl methacrylate are presented in the Table. Example 1 shows that the reaction rate and the selectivity to methyl methacrylate are both very high when using benzenephosphonic acid pK Example 3 shows that the presence of trifluoroacetic acid gives very high reaction rates and selectivities to methyl methacrylate. Example 4 shows that good results are obtained when using methacrylic acid pK Example 5 shows that reaction rate and selectivity to methyl methacrylate are both very high when using a triphenylphosphine in which each of the three phenyl groups carries an electron withdrawing substituent in combination with a protonic acid having a pK Comparative Experiment A shows that using a ratio mol phosphine to gram atom palladium of 6 results in a very low reaction rate. Comparative Experiments B and C show that reaction rate is very low when using a strong non carboxylic protonic acid. Comparative Experiment C also shows that the combination of a phosphine having an electron withdrawing substituent on the phenyl groups and a strong non carboxylic protonic acid results in a very low reaction rate. Comparative Experiment D shows that in the absence of a protonic acid the reaction rate is very low. The experiment of Example 1 was repeated using 10 ml methacrylic acid instead of 10 ml methanol and 40 ml diphenyl ether instead of 40 ml anisole. The reaction rate was 1400 mol allene per gram atom palladium per hour and the selectivity to methacrylic anhydride 95 , measured after 0.5 h. The experiment of Example 6 was repeated in the absence of benzenephosphonic acid. The reaction rate was 1100 mol allene per gram atom palladium per hour and the selectivity to methacrylic anhydride 92 , measured after 0.5 h. The experiment of Example 1 was repeated using 5 ml water instead of 10 ml methanol and 40 ml diglyme instead of 40 ml anisole. The reaction rate was more than 1000 mol allene per gram atom palladium per hour and the selectivity to methacrylic acid 85 , measured after 0.5 h. The experiment of Example 1 was repeated using 10 mmol trifluoroacetic acid instead of 10 mmol benzenephosphonic acid, 40 ml diphenyl ether instead of 40 ml anisole and using 10 ml methacrylic acid. The reaction rate was more than 1400 mol allene per gram atom palladium per hour and the selectivity to methacrylic anhydride 90 , measured after 0.5 h. The experiment of Example 1 was repeated using a partial allene pressure of 1.5 bar and a partial propyne pressure of 1.5 bar and 40 ml diphenyl ether instead of 40 ml anisole. The overall reaction rate was 320 mol allene propyne per gram atom palladium per hour and the selectivity to methyl methacrylate was 91 , measured after 2 h.
