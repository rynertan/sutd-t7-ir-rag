# ANIMAL GROWTH PROMOTANT

## Abstract
An animal growth promotant which comprises as an effective ingredient a peptide of the following formula I X A B Trp C Y wherein X is selected between hydrogen and t butoxycarbonyl A is selected from the group consisting of Leu, Ile, Phe, Ahx, Met, MetO and Phe Cl , either of L or D configuration B is selected from the group consisting of Pro, Ala, Gly, Val, Leu and Pip, either of L or D configuration C is selected from the group consisting of Val, Leu, Met, MetO, Ile, Phe, Phe Cl and Ahx, either of L or D configuration or A, B and C independently represent a chemical bond provided that at least one of them is an amino acid residue Y is selected from the group consisting of OH, OMe, OEt, OBzl, NH₂, NH Et, NEt₂ and the veterinarily acceptable salts thereof. A feed or veterinary composition containing it, and a method for promoting the growth of animals are also provided. New compounds according to formula I, wherein A is different from L Leu or L Phe or C is a chemical bond, as well as a method for preparing the same is disclosed.
