# HARD COPY RECORDER PAPER SPEED CONTROL

## Abstract
A hard copy recorder is provided in which paper or film is moved along a paper path by a motor driven roller. A tension measuring dancer measures paper or film tension. The position of the dancer is sensed by an optical sensor, which produces a signal representative of paper or film tension. The paper or film tension signal is used to selectively couple one signal from a number of sources of predetermined different frequencies to the motor to control its speed in accordance with the sensed paper tension.
