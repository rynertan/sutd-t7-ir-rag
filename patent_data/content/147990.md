# A process for preparing secondary aminoether alcohols.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a process for selectively preparing severely sterically hindered secondary aminoether alcohols by reacting a primary amino compound with a polyalkylene ether glycol in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst at elevated temperatures and pressures. The severe ly sterically hindered secondary aminoether alcohols are useful in acid gas scrubbing processes, particularly in the selective removal of H₂S from gaseous streams containing CO₂ and H₂S.
