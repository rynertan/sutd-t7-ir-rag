# METHOD FOR MANAGING VIRTUAL MEMORY TO SEPARATE ACTIVE AND STABLE MEMORY BLOCKS

## Abstract
A pointer, N, indicates an address in a virtual memory space of a demand paged memory including a plurality of virtual address pages page 1 Page n 1 and a fixed number of physical memory pages into which blocks of information B1 B17 can be written. A back up memory store 40 is provided for containing paged out memory pages. The pointer, N, is advanced along the virtual address pages to indicate the next available virtual address page for allocation, and newly allocated blocks are located on the virtual address page pointed to by said pointer N. Should the necessary space for a block allocation not exist on the page pointed to by said pointer, N, a page which is most recently used and least sparsely utilized is identified from the physical pages onto which blocks have been previously written the block is allocated on that page. If no space remains on the virtual address pages in physical memory for block alloca tion, then, a least recently used and most sparsely allocated page is identified and paged out to the back up store.
