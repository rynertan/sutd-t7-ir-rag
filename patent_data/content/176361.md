# VENDING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A pair of uprights 3, 4 are arranged on opposite sides of a stack of newspapers 5 and support between them a cross member carrying slides 11, 12 which rest on the top of the stack of newspapers and engage the top newspaper of the stack by means of inclined pins 20 . Operation of an electric motor 33 initiated by a coin or token inserted at 38 drives a crank 34 in an anti clockwise direction to the position shown in dotted lines so as to move the uprights to the position shown in dotted lines at 41 . This moves the slides 11, 12 to the left so as to cause the top newspaper of the stack to be moved until it falls off the top of the stack as shown at 39 , and thence into a vended position at 40 for access through a door 10 . The motor 33 continues to rotate so as to return the crank 34 to the full line position and then automatically stops, with the slides 11, 12 in position for vending the next newspaper.
