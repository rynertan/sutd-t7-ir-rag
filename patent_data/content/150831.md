## Description
NAPHTHALENE ANTI PSORIATIC AGENTS The invention relates to naphthalene derivatives which are useful in inhibiting certain dermatological conditions. This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions useful in relieving the effects of certain chronic recurrent papulosquamous dermatoses, e.g., psoriasis. This invention also relates to a process for preparing compounds of this invention. Psoriasis is a skin disease characterized in part by excessive proliferation of cells of the epidermis which remain strongly adherent and build up into a scaly plaque typical of the disease. Currently available therapies, which are not curative, depend on the control of epidermal cell proliferation through the use of hormonal agents, such as corticosteroids or through the use of compounds related to cancer chemotherapy such as hydroxyurea, methotrexate, and the nitrogen mustards. While the above agents are effective to a certa n extent, they cause numerous severe undesirable side effects including renal irritation, heretic toxicity, and erythema. The compounds, 2 methoxy 1,4 diacetyloxynaphthalene, 2 ethoxy 1,4 diacetyloxynaphthalene and 2 methoxy 3 methyl l,4 diacetyloxy naphthalene are known, but no useful biological activity has been ascribed to them.

Compound of formula V may also be prepared by reacting compound of formula VIII with an alcohol. To a solution of compound of formula VIII in the alcohol is added boron trifluoride etherate. The solution is heated from 500 to 100 C, preferably from 600 to 80oC for 1 2 hour to 4 hours1 preferably for 1 to 3 hours.Compound of formula V is recovered by filtration. Compounds of formula I are prepared from compounds of formula V by first hydrogenating to form compounds of formula IX EMI21.1 When R1 is alkoxy or phenoxy, compound of formula V is hydrogenated in a hydrogen atmosphere and a catalyst such as palladium on charcoal. When R1 is alkylthio or phenylthio or the R3 group contains a sulfur atom, compound of formula V is hydrogenated in the presence of cyclohexadiene and a catalyst such as palladium on charcoal. The hydrogenated compound is reacted with an alkanoyl or aroyl anhydride and pyridine dimethylaminopyridine such as acetic anhydride and the like in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether and the like. Compounds of formula I are recovered by recrystallization. The sulfinylnaphthalenes of formula I are prepared by oxidation of the corresponding thio compounds with a stoichiometric amount of a suitable peracid in an inert organic solvent. The compounds of formula I bearing a sulfonyl substituent are prepared by further oxidizing the compounds of formula I wherein R3 is a sulfinyl group with a suitable peracid typically at 10 to 750C for 1 to 10 hours. Preferably, m chloroperbenzoic acid in an inert organic solvent at room temperature is used to prepare the desired sulfonyl compounds. The acid anhydrides are commercially available from, i.a., Aldrich Chemical Co. or if not available may be prepared by condensing the appropriate acid in the presence of acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride containing a trace of phosphoric acid.

Forty percent w v peracetic acid in acetic acid 1 ml is added over 30 minutes to a solution of 2 methoxy 5 phenylthio 1,4 diacetyloxynaphthalene 0.98 g, 3 mmol in methylene chloride 15 ml . Excess peracetic acid is destroyed by the addition of a few milligrams of 5 palladium on carbon and the mixture filtered through a celite bed. The filtrate is concentrated in vacuo and the residue recrystallized from methanol giving 0.59 g of 2 methoxy 5 phenylsulfinyl1,4 diacetyloxynaphthalene. Similarly, using either peracetic acid or m chloroperbenzoic acid, the following compounds are prepared from the respective thio compounds 2 methoxy 5 imidazol 2 ylsulfinyl 1, 4 diacetyl oxynaphthalene 2 methoxy 6 2 chlorophenylsulfinyl 1,4 diacetyloxynaphthalene 2 methoxy 5 3 chlorophenylsulfinyl 1,4 diacetyloxynaphthalene 2 methoxy 6 4 chlorophenylsulfinyl l , 4 diacetyl oxynaphthalene 2 methoxy 5 2, 6 dichlorophenylsulfinyl 1, 4 di acetyloxynaphthalene 2 methoxy 5 4 fluorophenylsulfinyl 1,4 diacetyloxynaphthalene 2 methoxy 5 2 bromophenylsulfinyl 1,4 diacetyloxynaphthalene 2 methoxy 5 4 bromophenylsulfinyl 1,4 diacetyloxynaphthalene 2 ethoxy 6 4 methoxyphenylsulfinyl 1,4 diacetyloxynaphthalene 2 propoxy 6 4 nitrophenylsulfinyl 1,4 diacetyloxynaphthalene 2 n butoxy 6 2 ethylphenylsulfinyl 1,4 di acetyloxynaphthalene 2 methoxy 6 pyrimidin 2 ylsulfinyl 1,4 di acetyloxynaphthalene 2 methoxy 5 pyrimidin 4 ylsulfinyl 1,4 diacetyloxynaphthalene 2 methoxy 6 methylsulfinyl l, 4 diacetyloxy naphthalene 2 methoxy 5 benzylsulfinyl l, 4 diacetyloxy naphthalene and 2 methoxy 5 methoxycarbonylmethylsulfinyl 1,4 di acetyloxynaphthalene. EXAMPLE 4 2 methoxy 5 phenylsulfonyl l , 4 diacetyloxy naphthalene. Preparation of Compound of Formula I where R is phenylsulfonyl . A mixture of m chloroperbenzoic acid 300 mg and 2 methoxy 5 phenylthio 1,4 naphthoquinone 200 mg, 0. 61 mmol in methylene chloride 5 ml is stirred at 220C for 16 hours and the resulting solution then passed through an alumina column 10 g of Activity 1 eluting with chloroform. The eluates are concentrated to dryness and the residue is crystallized from isopropanol giving 95 mg of 2 methoxy 5 phenylsulfonyl 1,4 diacetyloxynaphthalene. EXAMPLE 5 Biological Data As indicative of anti psoriatic activity, the following test was carried out. Inhibition of Arachidonic Acid Induced Mouse Ear Edema MATERIALS AND METHODS Male or female Swiss Webster mice weighing 18 27 g were randomly assigned to treatment groups of 8 or 10 animals, caged together, and given food and water ad libitum. The test materials were prepared as solutions or suspensions in reagent grade acetone at a dose level of 100 mg ml and arachidonic acid was prepared as a solution in acetone also at 100 mg ml. The test materials were applied to the right ears of mice by means of an automatic microliter pipet so that 10 p1 of solution was applied to each of the inner and outer surfaces.Each ear therefore received a total of 20 p1 of solution containing 2 mg of test material. One hour after application of the test material, the arachidonic acid solution was applied in the same manner. One hour after the arachidonic acid application the animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the right ears were removed. An 8 mm disc was punched from each ear with a biopsy punch, and the discs were weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg. For the purpose of determining the anti inflammatory effect of test materials a negative control group receiving two applications of acetone only, and a positive control group receiving acetone alone followed by arachidonic acid were run in each experiment.The percent inhibition resulting from treatment with the test material was calculated as follows Inhib.
