# METHOD AND DEVICE FOR INPUTTING COORDINATES OF ROBOT.

## Abstract
A method and a device for inputting the coordinates of a robot acts so that the coordinates are input accurately by scanning the working area of the robot and inputting, as coordinates of the working position, positional data when a sensor has detected the working position. A movement data calculator 138 receives target position data from a pre teaching data area 146 , operates a pulse register 130 and drive circuits 152 , 154 , 156 , and makes the sensor positional data in a position register 130 coincide with the target positional data. It then receives positional vector data from a plane scanning data area 148 and a vertical scanning data area 150 and scans the sensor over the working area. When a detector 526 detects the fact that the sensor has reached the working position, a pulse distributor 11 stops the operation, and the sensor positional data stored in the register 130 is fed to a calculator writer 132 which calculates the positional coordinates of the robot, and writes them into a teaching data storage area 136 in a memory 134 .
