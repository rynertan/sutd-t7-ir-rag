# Bearing for liquid metal pump.

## Abstract
A liquid metal pump bearing support has a series of tangentially oriented spokes 32, 34 connecting the bearing cylinder to the pump housing 14 structure, which spokes may be arranged in a plurality of planes normal to the bearing axis with the spokes in one plane being arranged alternately with those in the next plane. The bearing support structure provides the pump with sufficient lateral support for the bearing structure together with the capability of accommodating differential thermal expansion without adversely affecting pump performance.
