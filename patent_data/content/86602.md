## Description
APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING THE TEMPERATURE OF FUEL SUPPLIED TO A VEHICLE ENGINE OR THE LIKE This invention relates to apparatus for controlling the temperature of fuel, particularly diesel fuel, supplied to a vehicle engine or other liquid fuel burning apparatus. In low temperature conditions e.g. at temperatures of around 100C to 200C, a serious problem commonly arises with motor vehicles driven by diesel engines in that the diesel fuel freezes in the tank and fuel supply lines to an extent that the fuel supply to the engine is cut off.By the term freezes it is not necessarily meant that the diesel fuel actually solidifies but it becomes more viscous and waxy crystals form so that the fuel cannot pass through the various filters provided in the fuel supply lines. Frequently a diesel engine will start and run for a short time in freezing conditions due to unfrozen fuel present in the engine and unfrozen portions of the fuel line. When such unfrozen fuel is used and the fuel pump mechanism of the vehicle attempts to pump frozen fuel from the tank to the engine, it fails to do so and the engine stops. This situation often results in the vehicle having to be abandoned on an open road where it can become a hazard to other road users. Attempts have been made to overcome the problem of freezing of diesel fuel by the provision of chemical additives to the diesel fuel in the vehicle fuel tank in order to lower the freezing point of the fuel. An alternative method has been to heat the fuel tank. Such methods are expensive and in the case of. fuel additives can conceivably reduce the efficiency of the engine. Similar problems can also arise in other liquid fuel burning apparatus e.g. domestic or industrial oil fired central heating systems and the present invention is applicable to such systems. An object of the present invention is to provide apparatus for incorporation in fuel systems which will obviate or mitigate the problem of freezing fuel in a simple and efficient manner. According to the present invention, there is provided apparatus for controlling the temperature of fuel supplied to a fuel burning unit comprising a chamber adapted to receive a limited amount of fuel at a low temperature from a source, heating means in said chamber for heating the low temperature fuel to a higher temperature, and outlet means from the chamber whereby the fuel at a higher temperature can be supplied to the fuel burning unit. Preferably the chamber is of a capacity which is substantially smaller than that of the source. According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a system of supplying fuel to a fuel burning unit, said system comprising a source of fuel and pump means for feeding the fuel from the source to the fuel burning unit characterised in that there is provided in the pipe line between the source and the fuel burning unit apparatus for controlling the temperature of fuel supplied to the unit, said apparatus comprising a chamber for receiving an amount of fuel at a low temperature from the source, heating means in said chamber for heating the low temperature fuel to a higher temperature, and outlet means from the chamber whereby the heated fuel can be supplied to the fuel burning unit. According to yet another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of controlling the temperature of fuel supplied to a fuel burning unit from a source characterised in that there is provided at a location in the supply line between the source and the unit a chamber for continuously receiving a limited amount of fuel at a low temperature from said source and heating said amount of fuel for passage to the fuel burning unit. An embodiment of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawing. Referring to the drawing, a vehicle driven by a diesel engine incorporates a fuel source in the form of a main fuel tank 1 within which is stored a supply of diesel fuel. A pumping mechanism not shown of known form, and which may, for example, include a lift pump and injection pump, normally pumps diesel fuel from the tank to the engine. The apparatus of the present invention comprises a container 2 of any suitable material buch as Perspex Registered Trade Mark . The container 2 defines a chamber 3 therewith in through which fuel can be drawn from the tank 1 by means of an interconnecting pipe 4 into the bottom of the chamber 3. Projecting into the bottom of the chamber 3 from the base of the container 2 is a 140 watt electric immersion coil 5 which, when energised, serves to heat fuel flowing into the bottom of the chamber 3 from the pipe 4. An outlet pipe 6 is connected through the pumping mechanism to the engine so that fuel from the container 2 can be supplied thereto.The end of the outlet pipe which is located within the container 2 is fitted with a fine brass gauze filter 7. It will be noted that fuel entering the pipe 4 in the fuel tank 1 does not pass through a filter so that the passage of fuel into the pipe 4 is as unrestricted as possible. It has been found suitable for the container 2 to have a capacity of about pint. If a vehicle having the above described apparatus fitted thereto encounters low temperature conditions sufficient to freeze the diesel fuel in the tank 1, the immersion heating coil 5 is energised for approximately 3 or 4 minutes prior to starting the engine. The fuel in the container 2 is thus heated to a temperature sufficient to ensure that the fuel is fed in a fluid condition to the engine. As the fuel is burned, the pumping mechanism is sufficient to pump cold fuel continuously from the tank 1, through the unrestricted pipe 4 and into the bottom of the chamber 3 where it remains sufficiently long to be heated by the coil 5.The warm fuel then passes out through the outlet pipe 6 to the engine. In this way a continuous supply of warm fuel is supplied to the engine. It will be appreciated that by virtue of the present invention, only a small amount of fuel requires to be heated at a given time so that the process is much more efficient than one which involves heating the whole of the fuel tank. Although the invention has been described above with particular reference to motor vehicles powered by a diesel engine, it will be readily appreciated that it can be used in other vehicles such as railway engines, military tanks or the like. In addition it can be used for fuels other than diesel fuel. Furthermore in a situation where there is a long run of fuel line between the fuel tank and the engine, a plurality of containers in accordance with the invention can be incorporated at spaced intervals along the fuel line. In a further application of the present invention the apparatus, for example as shown in the drawing, is incorporated in a domestic or industrial oil fired central heating system. In this instance, the immersion heating unit of the invention is fitted into the fuel supply system in advance of the boiler of the central heating system in a manner similar to the fitting thereof in relation to a vehicle engine. It is considered that the only modification which requires to be made is that the inlet pipe to the unit from the fuel supply tank is of a relatively large diameter e.g. one inch. This will permit waxy, partially frozen fuel to gain access to the immersion heating unit in low temperature conditions. It is envisaged that when used for a heating system, the unit of the present invention can be continuously heated by means of the immersion coil. When the present invention is used in tarnation to a vehicle engine, it is considered that fuel economy of the engine is improved.
