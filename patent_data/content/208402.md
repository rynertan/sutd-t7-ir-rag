# Tag assemblies.

## Abstract
A tag assembly 1 comprises male and female tag mem bers 2 and 3 intended to be disposed on opposite sides of an animal s ear and to be held together by a part 5 passing through the ear. The female tag member 3 has a laminar body 9 and a laminar extension 19 in the plane of the body 9 having an arrow shaped head 21 which may be forced through a curved slot 22 in an attachment member 11 in order to sec urely attach the attachment member 11 to the tag assembly 1. The attachment member 11, which may serve a marking func tion or as a means of applying insecticide to the animal, is readily replaceable by a fresh attachment member without removing the tag assembly 1 from the animal, and, if desired, more than one attachment member may be accommodated at a time on the extension 19.
