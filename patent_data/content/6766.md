## Description
PHENETHANOLAMINES, THEIR FORMULATIONS, USE AND PREPARATION This invention relates to phenethanolamine derivatives, pharmaceutical formulations containing those compounds, methods of preparing the novel compounds and their use in weight control of mammals. Some of the most extensive efforts in basic research have been in the area of phenylethylamine derivatives, many of which are catecholamines. A great deal of study, for example, has been carried out on the naturally occurring catecholamine epinephrine.Epinephrine is a potent sympathomimetic drug and a powerful cardiac stimulant. The use of epinephrine is limited, however, due to its undesirable side effects, which include fear, anxiety, tremor, tenseness, throb bing headache, increased blood pressure, dizziness, respiratory difficulty and palpitation, as well as its short duration of action. The use of drugs which cause more than one biological effect can be very dangerous. For example, since both bronchodilation and cardiac stimulation are mediated by the broad group of receptors known as 9 receptors, a drug acting on such ss receptors not only would effect bronchodilation, but additionally could cause observable effects upon the heart. In fact, some individuals allegedly hav died from ventricular fibrillation caused by excessive 5 stImulation after using bronchodildtion agents See GreenDurg and mines, Br. Med. J. 1, 563 1967 . The cardiac effects of phenethylamXne aerivatives has long been known see for instance U.S. Patent Specification No. 3,816,516 which describes the 3 agonist properties of certain l phenyl 2 alkylaminoalkanol derivatives similar to the compounds of the invention. The Applicants have now discovered that surprisingly certain para substituted N phenylpropyl phenethanolamines are effective in causing loss, or preventing formation, of adipose tissue in mammals and that this hitherto unsuspected activity in this type of compound is obtained with minimal associated cardiac effects. According to the present invention there is provided a compound of the formula I EMI2.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen or fluorine R3 is aminocarbonyl, methylaminocarbonyl, orC1 C2 alkoxycarbonyl or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In one aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical formulation which comprises a compound of formula I , or a pharmaceuticallyacceptable salt thereof, associated with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor. Whilst the compounds provided by this invention are referred to generically as phenethanolamines, they will be systematically named herein as N sub stituted 3 phenylpropylamines. For example, a compound having the above formula wherein R1 and R2 both are hydrogen and R3 is aminocarbonyl will be named herein as N 2 phenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 3 4 aminocar bonylphenyl propylamine. The asymmetric carbon atom, namely the carbon atom labeled C in the above formula, preferably has the R stereochemical configuration as described byCahn et al., Experientia, Vol. XII, pp. 81 124 1956 . The compounds provided by this invention can be prepared by any of a number of methods involving well known and routinely used chemical processes. A preferred process involves the reaction of a styrene oxide preferably optically active with a 3 phenylpropylamine. According to this aspect of the invention there is provided a method of preparing a compound of formula I in which a styrene oxide of formula it EMI3.1 where R1 is as defined above, is reacted with a propylamine derivative of formula EMI3.2 where R3 is as defined above, followed, in the case where the styrene oxide is not optically active, i.e.is not an R styrene oxide, and it is desired to produce an optically active product, by resolution using conventional methodology. For example, a styrene oxide, such asR ortho fluorostyrene oxide, can be reacted with approximately an equimolar quantity of a phenylpropylamine such as 3 4 methylaminocarbonylphenyl propyl amine to provide the corresponding phenethanolamine of this invention, for instance R N 2 2 fluorophenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 3 4 methylaminocarbonylphenyl propylamine. Such condensation reactions normally are carried out in an unreactive polar organic solvent such as ethanol, dioxane, toluene or dimethylformamide, and usually at a temperature of from about 20 to about 1200C, preferably from 50 to 1100C.Under such conditions, the condensation generally is substantially complete after about 6 to about 10 flours, and the product phenethanolamine can be isolated by simply removing the reaction solvent, for instance by evaporation under reduced pressure. Further purification of the product thus formed can be accomplished if desired by standard methods including chromatography, crystallization and salt formation. Another preferred method for preparing the compounds of this invention involves reacting a mandelic acid derivative with a phenyipropylamine to provide the corresponding condensed amide, and then reducing the amide carbonyl group to provide a compound of formula I . Such a method is ideally suited to the preparation of compounds wherein R3 is an alkoxycarbonyl substituent. Accordingly in a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of preparing a compound of formula I which comprises reducing a compound of formula III EMI5.1 where R1 and R3 are as defined above, followed in the case where the mandelic acid derivative is not the a enantiomer, and it is desired to prepare an optically active final product, by resolution using conventional methodology. The reaction of the mandelic acid derivative with the phenylpropylamine is best accomplished utilizing coupling reagents such as those commonly used in the synthesis of peptides. Such routinely used coupling reagents include carbodiimides such as N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC and N,N diisopropylcarbodiimide, as well as N ethoxycarbonyl 2ethoxy 1,2 dihydroquinoline EEDQ . Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide generally is a preferred coupling reagent.A substituted or unsubstituted l hydroxybenzotriazole can be employed to accelerate the reaction if desired.The general process for preparing peptides utilizing dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and l hydroxybenzotriazole is discussed in detail by Konig and Geiger in Chem. Ber., 103, 788 798 1970 . For instance, either 2 phenyl2 hydroxyacetic acid or 2 2 fluorophenyl 2 hydroxyacetic acid can be reacted with approximately an equimolar quantity of a 3 phenylpropylamine in the presence of a substantially equimolar amount of both dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and l hydroxybenzotriazole.The coupling reaction is best carried out in an organic solvent such as dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphorotriamide, acetonitrile or dichloromethane.The reaction normally is carried out at a reduced temperature, for example at a temperature below about 500C., generally at about 0 to about 100C. The reaction normally is substantially complete within about two to about twenty hours however, longer reaction periods appear not to be detrimental to the desired product and can be utilized if desired. The coupling of an acid and an amine in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide to form an amide converts the dicyclohexylcarbodiimide to dicyclohexylurea. This latter compound is characteristically quite insoluble in organic solvents and accordingly can be removed from the reaction mixture simply by filtration. Once the dicyclohexylurea is removed from the reaction mixture, the product amide can be isolated by removal of the reaction solvent, for instance by evaporation or the solvent under a reduced pressure.The product thus formed can be dissolved in a water immiscible organic solvent such as ethyl acetate and washed with aqueous sodium bicarbonate to remove any remaining l hydroxybenzotriazole. The amide so formed can, if desired, be further purified by routine procedures including crystallization and chromatography. The amide next is reduced to provide the corresponding N phenylpropyl phenethanolamine comprehended by this invention. Reduction of such amide can be accomplished by any of a number of routine reduction processes, such as reaction with metal hydride reducing agents. A preferred reduction process comprises reaction of an amide with diborane.In such a reduction reaction, the diborane typically is utilized in an excess amount relative to the amide, such as from about 1 to about 4 molar excess. The reduction generally is carried out in an organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether1 benzene, dichloromethane, toluene, dioxane, or like solvents. Such reduction reactions typically are complete within about two to twenty hours when carried out at a temperature of from about 0 to about 100 C. Any excess diborane and borane complex remaining in the reaction mixture after the reduction of the amide is complete can be decomposed by the addition to the reaction mixture of an alcohol such as methanol or ethanol and an acid such as hydrochloric acid. The reduced product thus formed can be isolated by simply removing the reaction solvent, for example by evaporation. The product, a phenethanolamine having the above formula, generally exists as a solid and can thus be further purified by crystallization or chroma tography. Alternatively, the amine so formed can be converted to an acid addition salt, as will be discussed more fully hereinbelow. When the above described processes for preparing a compound of formula I are carried out utilizing unresolved starting materials, thereby affording racemic mixtures of N phenylpropyl phenethanolamines, separation of the diastereomers so formed can be accomplished by conventional techniques known per se in the art, if required. However, since the S isomer is substantially inactive, having no adverse side effects at the therapeutically effective dose levels, the racemate is advantageously utilized without resolution. However, it should be emphasized that it is the R isomer which conveys the biological activity. In one aspect of the invention there is provided a method of improving the quality of meat, in livestock animals such as pigs, sheep or cattle by administering to those animals a compound of formula I .This improvement in meat quality may take place in two ways firstly, adipose tissue already present may be removed and, secondly, formation of adipose tissue may be prevented. The compound of formula I will normally be administered to the animal in its feed. Accordingly, in a further aspect of the invention there is provided animal feed containing a compound of formula I , or a pharmaceuticallyacceptable salt thereof. Another method of preparing compounds comprehended by this invention comprises reacting a phenethanolamine with an aldehyde or ketone to provide the corresponding Schiff base, followed by reduction of the Schiff base. Such process is illustrated by the following scheme EMI9.1 The condensation of the phenethanolamine and the phenethyl aldehyde can be carried out in an organic solvent such as toluene, generally in the presence of an acidic catalyst such as para toluenesulfonic acid. The product from the condensation is an imine, i.e., a Schiff base, which upon reduction provides the corresponding phenethanolamine gf the invention. The reduction is typically carried out with hydrogen or with a metal hydride such as sodium cyanoborohydride. Still another method for preparing the compounds of this invention comprises reacting a hydroxy protected 2 phenyl 2 hydroxyacetic acid acylating agent with a 3 phenylpropylamine to provide an amide, and then reduction of the amide carbonyl group to provide a compound of this invention. Such process is depicted by the following scheme EMI10.1 R1 and R3 in the above formulae are as defined above, X is a good leaving group and M is a readily removable hydroxy protecting group. Commonly used hydroxy protecting groups include acyl moieties such as acetyl, chloroacetyl and dichloroacetyl, as well as ether forming groups such as trimethylsilyl and the like. Such readily removable hydroxy protecting groups are more fully described by E. Haslam in ProtectiveGroups in Organic Chemistry, J.F.W.McOmie, Ed.,Plenum Press, New York, N.Y., 1973, Chapter 3. As noted above, X is defined as a good leaving group and includes halogen groups such as chloride and bromide, as well as acyloxy groups such as acetoxy and dichloroacetoxy. As an example of the preparation of a compound of this invention utilizing a hydroxy protected mandelic acid acylating agent, a compound such as R 2. 2 fluorophenyl 2 hydroxyacetic acid can be reacted with dichloroacetyl chloride to provide R 2 2 fluorophenyl 2 dichloroacetoxyacetic acid. Reaction of this latter compound with a halogenating agent such as thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride provides the corresponding acid chloride, namely R 2 2 fluorophenyl 2 dichloroacetoxyacetyl chloride.Reaction of such acid chloride with a phenylpropylamine provides the corresponding amide. The amide so formed is then reduced, for example by reaction with diborane or the like, and the hydroxy protecting group is removed, for instance by hydrolysis, thus providing an optically active compound having the above formula. A further method for preparing compounds comprehended by this invention comprises reacting a phenacyl halide with a 3 phenylpropylamine. For example, a phenacyl halide such as 2 fluorophenacyl bromide can be reacted with about an equimolar quantity of an amine such as 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylamine.Such alkylation reactions normally are carried out in a suitable solvent such as ethanol and in the presence of a base such as sodium carbonate or triethylamine.The reaction is complete within about six hours when carried out at about 500C. and provides a ketone intermediate, for instance N 2 2 fluorophenyl 2 oxoethyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylamine. The ketone thus formed can be isolated as the free amine base or as an acid addition salt. Reduction of such ketone, for example by reaction with sodium borohydride or the like, affords a compound of this invention, generally as a mixture of optical isomers at C. Such mixture of optical isomers can be sepa rated by standard procedures, or if desired can be utilized directly in the present invention, since theS isomer is essentially devoid of biological activity. Compounds of the above formula wherein R3 is aminocarbonyl can be prepared either directly by reacting the appropriate phenylpropylamine with a styrene oxide or alternatively can be derived from those compounds wherein R3 is C1 C2 alkoxycarbonyl, i.e. methoxycarbonyl or ethoxycarbonyl. For example,R mandelic acid can be coupled with 3 4 methoxycarbonylphenyl propylamine to provide, after reduction of the amide carbonyl group, the corresponding optically active amine namely R N 2 phenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 3 4 methoxRycarbonylphenyl propylamine. This amine can be reacted with hydrazine for about 2 to 40 hours at about 50 to 1000C. to convert the alkoxycarbonyl group to a hydrazino carbonyl group.The latter compound can be converted by hydrogenation to the corresponding aminocarbonyl derivative. Such hydrogenation is accomplished utilizing common catalysts such as Raney nickel. Compounds of formula I wherein Pus3 is methylaminocarbonyl are preferably prepared by reacting a styrene oxide with a 3 4 methylaminocar bonylphenyl propylamine. The required phenylpropylamine starting material can be prepared by simply reacting methyl amine with the appropriate benzoyl chloride derivative. For example, 3 4 chlorocarbonylphenyl propylaminium chloride can be reacted with methylamine to provide 3 4 methylaminocarbonylphenyl propylamine. Reaction of the latter compound with a styrene oxide affords a compound of formula I . The compounds provided by this invention are amines and as such are basic in nature. Consequently, they can readily be converted to acid addition salts by reaction with organic or inorganic acids. Accordingly, an additional embodiment of this invention comprises pharmaceutically acceptable salts of theN phenylpropyl phenethanolamines of the abdve formula.The particular acids utilized to form salts of this invention are not critical, and such silts include those which are prepared by reaction of the amine of this invention with any of a number of common acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, nitric, perchloric, formic, acetic, butyric, citric, maleic, succinic, oxalic, fumaric, lactic, methanesulfonic, p toluenesulfonic, and related acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts which are formed by reaction of an amine of this invention with an acid such as one of the above named acids typically exist as highly crystalline solids, and thus lend themselves to ready purification by recrystallization from common solvents such as methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate and the like.Additionally, such salts are easily formulated for convenient administration, particularly by the oral route, to subjects in need of treatment for obesity. When desired, such acid addition salts are readily converted to the corresponding free amine base by reaction with a suitable basic compound, for instance sodium or potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, triethylamine, sodium bicarbonate, and the like. Obesity is a very serious disease that currently is the subject of a great deal of concern, particularly since no truly effective treatments are known. A full discussion of nutritional diseases and obesity in general is presented by Albrink in Textbook of Medicine, 12th Ed., 1969, W. B. Saunders Company,Philadelphia, Pa., pp. 1164 1174 and by Salans inCurrent Therapy, 1977, W. B Saunders Company, p.455 460. Compounds provided by this invention are particularly useful due to their ability to effect an actual reduction in weight when administered to a mature obese animal. Such weight reduction is accom lishes without a concomitant reduction in daily food consumption. When the compounds of this invention are administered to immature obese animals, the degree of weight gain is significantly reduced compared to that observed in young obese animals not receiving a compound of the invention. The anti obesity activity of the compounds of this invention has been demonstrated in a number of biological tests utilizing mice, rats and dogs. One of the major actions of the claimed compounds on a biological system appears to be the mobilization of fatty acids from adipose tissue stores. In addition, the compounds of this invention cause an actual reduction in body weight in mature obese animals without causing a decrease in food consumption, i.e., without causing appetite suppression. As already pointed out, the unique physiological effect of the compounds of this invention is their potent anti obesity activity and their physiologically tolerable degree of cardiovascular activity.This unique and unexpected separation of biological activity is achieved by selecting the proper chemical substitution pattern in the phenethanolamines of the invention. Because of the surprisingly low inotropic activity of the compounds of this invention, they can be administered to an animal at doses large enough to effect release of free fatty acids from adipose stores without causing a substantial increase in the pumping force of the heart. Such unique biological spectrum of the compounds of this invention renders them particularly useful in the control of weight in obese animals. As used herein, weight control in obese animals refers to the ability of the compounds of this invention to effect an actual weight reduction when administered to a mature obese animal, whereas such compounds are effective in the prevention of excessive weight gain when administered to immature obese animals.The terms mature and immature are used herein to refer to the generally accepted definitions of age and growth patterns. Obesity is an art recognized term and is used as such herein. An additional aspect of this invention is a method for controlling weight in obese animals. WhIle the anti obesity effective dose of a compound of this invention employed in the control of obesity will vary depending on the particular drug employed and the severity of the condition being treated, the usual dosage of a compound of this invention will be from about 1.0 to about 25 mg. per kilogram of animal body weight. The compounds of the invention preferably will be administered orally at a dosage of from about 1 to about 5 mg. kg., generally given in individual doses from one to four times per day. When desired, the drug can be administered orally in the form of a tablet or capsule, or alternatively in sustained release form.According to the method of this inven tion a compound defined by the above general formula is administered to a mature obese animal to effect ar. actual reduction in weight without diminishing the daily food consumption. The drug will be administered daily, at increasing dosage levels if desired, until the desired weight reduction is effected. The compounds of the invention can be administered to an immature obese animal to effect a reduction in weight gain without a diminished daily food consumption.Once the immature obese animal reaches maturity, a reduction of weight will be effected until a substantially normal weight is achieved. The compounds comprehended by this invention can be formulated by normal procedures for convenient administration by any of a number of routes. It is preferred that the compounds be formulated for oral administration. Pharmaceutical formulations which are useful in weight control in obese animals are provided in a further embodiment of this invention. Such pharmaceutical compositions can contain, as active ingredient, one or more of the compounds provided by this invention, in combination i desired with any of the inactive isomers as hereinbefore indicated, in addition to any of a number of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents.Typical carriers and diluents commonly used include gelatin, starch, dextrose, sucrose, lactose, cellulose derivatives, stearates, polyvinylpyrrolidine, glycerine, ethyl lactate, sorbitol, mannitol, and the like. A suitable pharmaceutical composition can additionally include any of a number of common preserving agents, stabilizers, antioxidants, taste correctors, and the like. Examples of such additives include ascorbic acid, sorbic acid, various esters of p hydroxybenzole acid, and the like. Typical pharmaceutical compositions seful in the treatment of obesity according to this in vention will generally include from about 1 to about 50 percent by weight of a compound of this invention as active ingredient. The remainder of said pharma ceutical composition will comprise suitable carriers and diluents. A pharmaceutical composition containing as active ingredient at least one of the compounds of this inventIon can be molded into tablets, encapsulated into empty gelatin capsules, or made into a solution or suspension. Such pharmaceutica comrositions can be administered to an obese subject In need of treat ment by any of a number of routes, including the oral and parenteral routes. A preferred formulation, for example, comprises about 500 mg.G of N 2 phenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 3 4 a.minocarbonylphenol p cOvl mnn n chloride admixed wit any of a number of suitable carriers and molded into a tablet for oral adminis tration to an obese human subject at te rate o from 1 to about 4 tablets per day for effective weight control. In an effort to more fully illustrate particular aspects of this invention, the following Preparations illustrate how starting materials useful in the invention may be prepared whereas the followingExamples illustrate the preparation of final products of formula I and their use in pharmaceutical formulations, The Examples are representative only and should not be construed as limiting in any respect.
