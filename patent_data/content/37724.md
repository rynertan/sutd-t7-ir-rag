## Description
PHOTOGRAPHIC COLOUR DIFFUSION TRANSFER MATERIALS CONTAINING TIMING LAYERS This invention relates to photographic colour diffusion transfer materials. It is customary in many photographic colour diffusion transfer materials to incorporate an acid substance which will cause a lowering of the pH when processing is completed. However, without any special arrangements such a lowering of the pH could occur too rapidly and before processing was complete. Such a difficulty has been overcome by having a timing layer between the acid layer and the point of discharge of the alkaline processing composition. The timing layer only allows passage of the alkali after a given time thus giving greater control in the design of the photographic material. British Specification 1,544,306 describes timing layers comprising a film forming linear polymer with a molecular weight of from 5000 to 100,000 wherein the linear chain of the polymer comprises alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments joined to one another through carbonate, urethane and or ester groups.While it is suggested that the hydrophobic segments could be polymeric, the specific polymers disclosed employ only monomeric hydrophobic groups. The polymers employed are contrasted with prior art vinyl polymers wherein the polymer backbone consists of carbon only and it is suggested that such polymers are inferior as timing layers to those having heteroatoms in their backbone. Since the development process is temperaturedependent, it is often necessary to adjust the temperaturedependence of the timing layer to obtain maximum temperature latitude of processing. The present invention provides addition block co polymer timing layers whose break down time varies with changes in temperature and thus enables temperature dependence profiles to be matched to the requirements of a particular image transfer material. According to the present invention there is provided a photographic colour diffusion transfer material containing an acid layer and a timing layer characterised in that the timing layer comprises an addition block copolymer comprising blocks of polymerised styrene or a substituted styrene and blocks of a homoor co polymer which is alkali permeable or which becomes alkali permeable after contact with alkali. It is believed that the block copolymers employed herein have the ability to separate into microphases due to the incompatability of their constituent parts.It is thought therefore that the timing layer made therefrom can be considered as a hydrophilic or potentially hydrophilic matrix containing hydrophobic regions. The morphology of the layer can be controlled by varying the lengths and the ratio of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic blocks. Such variations, in turn, cause the break down time behaviour to vary. The polymerised styrene blocks may be formed from styrene itself or styrene substituted with, for example, hydrocarbon groups, particularly alkyl groups of 1 4 carbon atoms. Specific substituted styrenes include E methyl styrene and a methylstyrene. The monomers from which the alkali permeable blocks are made may vary widely. The monomers may, for example, contain acid groups or basic nitrogen containing groups. Alternatively they may contain hydrolysable groups, for example, esters. Particular examples of such monomers are vinyl acetate, N vinylcaprolactam, N vinylpyrrolidone, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, methacrylic acid and N vinylimidazole either alone or in combination. The block copolymer may contain 10 45 weight percent styrene blocks, preferably 15 20 weight percent. The block copolymers may be prepared by known methods, for example that described by T. Otsu, J. Polym.Sci. 26 236 1957 but any other method suitable for preparing block copolymers described in the literature can be used. e.g. described for example in Block andGraft Copolymerization by R.J. Ceresa, Wiley, London 1973. The present timing layers may be present in complete dye diffusion transfer film units or in separate photosensitive materials or receiving sheets. Various formats for colour diffusion transfer film units are described in the prior art, such asU.S. Patents 3,415,644, 3,415,645, 3,415,646, 3,647,437, 3,636,707 and 3,756,815 and Canadian Patents 928,559 and 674,082. In these formats, the image receiving layer containing the photographic image for viewing can remain permanently attached and integral with the image generating and auxiliary layers present in the structure when a transparent support is employed on the viewing side of the film unit. Other so called peel apart formats for colour diffusion transfer film units are described, for example, in U.S. Patents 2,983,606, 3,362,819 and 3,362,821. In those formats, an image receiving element is separated from the photosensitive element after development and transfer of the dyes to the image receiving layer. A preferred format of the colour transfer film units of this invention is depicted in BritishSpecifications 1,330,524 and 1,405,662 which describe integral colour transfer formats consisting of a laminated sandwich of an integral negative receiver element, a transparent processing cover sheet and, adapted to be spaced between them, an opaque viscous processing composition spread by rupturing a pod by drawing the transfer sandwich between a pair of juxtaposed rollers.On the transparent film support of the integralnegative receiver are coated successively an imagereceiving layer, a white reflective pigment layer, an opaque layer, three image forming units and an overcoat layer. On the transparent film support of the cover sheet are coated successively a neutralizing layer and a timing layer. The unit is exposed through the cover sheet while the viewing of the image is from the opposite side. Cover sheets useful for the above format, as well as for all other colour transfer systems, are described in British Patents 878,064 and 1,340,349 and U.S. Patent 3,414,411. Other film unit formats in which this invention may be employed are described in U.S. Patents 3,362,821, 3,415,644, 3,415,645, 3,415,646, 3,647,437, 3,635,707 and 3,362,819 and British Specification 1,330,524. The dye image providing materials which may be employed in this invention generally may be characterized as either 1 initially soluble or diffusible in the processing composition but being selectively rendered nondiffusible in an imagewise pattern as a function of development, such as those disclosed, for example, inU.S. Patents 2,647,049, 2,661,293, 2,698,244, 2,698,798, 2,802,735, 2,774,668 and 2,983,606 or 2 initially insoluble or nondiffusible in the processing composition but being selectively rendered diffusible in an imagewise pattern as a function of development, for example, those disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patents 3,227,550, 3,227,551, 3,227,552, 3,227,554, 3,243,294 and 3,445,228. These materials may be preformed dyes or dye precursors, e.g.colour couplers or oxichromic compounds. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the dye image providing material is a nondiffusible redox dye releaser. Such compounds are, generally speaking, compounds which can be oxidized by oxidized developing agent, i.e., crossoxidized, to provide a species which will release a diffusible dye, such as by alkaline hydrolysis. Such redox dye releasers are described in U.S. Patents 3,725,062, 3,698,897, 3,628,952, 3,443,939, 3,443,940, 3,928,312, 3,929,760, 3,980,379, 3,993,638, 3,954,476, 3,932,380 and U.S. PublishedPatent Application B 351,673, British Specifications 1,405,662, 1,464,104, 1,464,105, 1,458,471, 1,465,183 and 1,465,184.

The cover sheet, consisting of a layer of alizarin yellow indicator gelatin coated on a polyethylene terephthalate film base, is soaked in 0.5 M KOH 20 secs. and the two sheets laminated together, using hand rollers. The dye density was read by reflection every 15 seconds, as the colour of the dye changed with changes of pH. The timing layer breakdown time TLB was assessed as the time in seconds at which the density first begins to fall. The temperature coefficient is obtained from an Arhenius plot of measuring the release characteristics over a range of temperatures the slope of a plot of log TUB 1 in 0K gives the activation energy or, more precisely the temperature coefficient.
