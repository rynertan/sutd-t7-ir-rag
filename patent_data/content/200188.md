# COMPOUNDS HAVING SOMATOSTATIN LIKE ACTIVITY USEFUL FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF LOCAL ANTI INFLAMMATORY COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
Compounds having somatostatin like activity have been found to be useful for the manufacture of local anti inflammatory agents in the treatment of such conditions as, for example, psoriasis, eczema, seborrhea, and other local ized inflammatory and allergic conditions. Particularly useful are cyclic and bridged somatostatin analogs.
