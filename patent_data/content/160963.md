# Depository printer mechanism for an automated teller machine.

## Abstract
A depository printer mechanism is provided for use with an automated teller machine ATM . The mechanism in cludes an envelope tray for receiving a customer envelope to be deposited in a depository bin, a support assembly for supporting the envelope tray for movement between hori zontal and vertical positions, and a printer frame secured to the support assembly. A printer carriage is also provided including a motor for reciprocating the printer carriage in the printer frame between a first position and a second position, and from the second position back to the first position. The printer carriage includes a printer module for printing indicia on the customer envelope. The printer carriage further includes several subassemblies a drive assembly and a slide rod assembly for driving the printwheel against the customer envelope, and a pivot assembly for rotating the envelope tray from the horizontal position to the vertical position as the motor drives the printer carriage from the second position back to the first position. The depository printer mechanism thus supports a stationary customer envelope during printing of indicia thereon by a single reciprocating printing carriage, thus obviating a costly and complex transport, control circuitry therefor and a plurality of printer modules.
