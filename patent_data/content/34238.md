## Description
PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIVE AMINE CARBOXYBORANES Current research investigations for compounds having desirable biological activities and use in cancer chemotherapy treatments reveal the need for compounds with minimal toxicity and increased biological activity. The use of boron compounds in neutron capture therapy was suggested as early as 1936 byG. I. Locher, American Journal, Vol. 36, p.l 1936 . The rational for this therapy, now quite familiar to boron chemists, rests upon the fact that 1OB and thermal neutrons a nuclear reaction capable of destroying cells. Only very important requirement for utilization of this approach is a large concentration differential of 103 between the neoplasm and normal tissue so that only the tumor is destroyed. Included in the neutron capture therapy approach is the concept, advanced by A. H.Soloway, Progress In Boron Chemistry, Vol. 1,The MacMillan Company, New York, 1964, Chapter 4, of preparing antimetabolites or other carcinostatic agents containing boron for a possible two fold attack on a neoplasm. Thus, direct inhibition of tumor growth by the boron compound could be coupled with selective incorporation of the compound into the neoplasm with concomitant use of the neutron capture theory. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to this invention, there is provided novel amine carboxyborane compounds which exhibit significant antihyperlipidemic cholesterol lowering activity. More specifically, amine carboxyboranes depicted by the chemical formula R1R2NHH BC O OH wherein R1 and ss2 are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, propyl and n butyl have been shown to be exhibit significant antihyperlipidemic activity. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The process of preparing the novel amine carboxyboranes and their utilities are more fully illustrated in the following discussion and examples. The relative amounts of the reactants mentioned herein are in parts by weight and room temperature includes the temperature range of 20 30 C. EXAMPLE I Axmnonia carboxyborane H3N.H2BC O OH DescriptiveDiscussion Synthesis, X Ray Crystal Structure, andBiological Activity of Ammonia carboxyborane, the Boron Analogue of Glycine The boron analogue of glycine, ammonia carboxyborane H3N BH2C02H , was prepared by an amine displacement reaction on Me3N.BH2CO2H, and structurally characterized by single crystal X ray analysis biological assays indicate that this compound is biologically active, in particular it has been shown to possess significant antihyperlipidemic activity. Glycine, H2NCH2C02H or H3NCH2C02, may be considered the simplest alpha amino acid and was the first to be discovered. We have now discovered the synthesis and characterization of its isoelectronic and isosteric protonated boron analogue, ammonia carboxyborane, H3N.3H CO H referred to in Table 1 as Compound 1. This compound may be viewed as the parent of a novel class of boron analogues of the command alpha amino acids. Although we have previously reported the synthesis of other amine carboxyboranes, e.g. Me3NSH2C02H, the boron analogue of betaine in the Journal of America Chemical Society,Vol. 98, p.5703, 1976, all previous examples did not contain hydrogen bonded directly to nitrogen.An extremely important feature of the present example, like its glycine counterpart, is its potential to form peptide linkages and to be incorporated into proteins. The structure of Compound 1 has been unequivocally established by single crystal X ray analysis and its stability in several media investigated. Preliminary testing ofCompound I in animal model studies has demonstrated biological activity, in particular, significant antihyperlipidemic activity. Preparation of ammonia carboxyborane was achieved by an amine exchange reaction. One part of Me3N.BH2CO2H was allowed to react with 10 parts liquid NH3 in an evacuated stainless steel cylinder at room temperature for 3 weeks after which time excess ammonia was allowed to evaporate off and removed finally by pumping out. The residue was transferred to a flask with the aid of dryCHCl3, refluxed for 3 4 hours, filtered hot, and washed with hot CHC13 to give H3N BH2C02H as an insoluble residue.This procedure led to yield of crude product in the 50 55 range which remained essentially constant even when the time of reaction was increased from 3 to 6 weeks a reaction period of 2 weeks gave H3N.BH2CO2H in 30 yield. When the crude product is freshly crystallized from cold water it melts at 1160C but this is lowered, with no observable change in spectral characteristics, after storage of the product in screw capped vials over a period of time in normal laboratory conditions.

Single crystal X ray analysis established the structure of ammonia carboxyborane unequivocally.

Germain et al, Acta Crystallogr.,Section A, Vol. 27, p.368. Full matrix least squares refinement of atomic positional and thermal anisotropic B, C, 4N, 0 isotropic H parmaters converged to an R value of 0.052 over 598 statistically significant ti greater than 2.0 sigma I reflections measured on an Enraf Nonius CAD 3 automated diffractometer Ni filtered Cu K alpha radiation, o lambda 1.5418 A theta 2 theta scans . Although molecules of H3N.H2BC O OH exist in the solid state in a form typical of optically inactive or racemic carboxylic acids, i.e. as centrosymmetric dimers, they have a slightly longer, and thus weaker, O H. . .0 hydrogen bonded distance 0. ..0 2.668 2 in H3N.H2BC O OH vs. ca. 2.64 in simple acids . Dimer of H3N.H2BC O OH are further associated via interdimer 0 N H. . .0 hydrogen bonds N. . .0 2.981 and 3.157 Al involving two of the amino hydrogen atoms, class of relatively strong intermolecular interactions not available to simple carboxylic acids, and a feature which must be partly responsible for the elevated melting point of H3N.H2BC O OH compared to propionic acid 20.8 C . Hydrolysis of H3N.H2BC O OH occurs very slowly as manifested by the observation that a 0.118M solution thereof in water underwent only trace decomposition in 3 hours. Very slow decomposition of H3N.H2BC O OH also took place in alkali a a 0.126M solution thereof in 1N NaOH underwent only 0.33 decomposition in 3 hours, with tapering off after that time, only trace amounts of gas being evolved in the following 3 days. In contrast, H3N.H2BC O OH is readily hydrolyzed in acid, e.g. a 2.23 1 mole ratio of gas to H3N.H2BC O OH was evolved after 3.5 hours from a 0.126M solution ofH3N.H2BC O OH in 1N HC1, and this increased to 2.27 after 20.5 hours by which time gas evolution was complete. Assuming that only hydrolysis of the B H bonds occurs, a total of two moles of H2 per mole of H3N.H2BC O OH would be anticipated. However, ir. analysis of the evolved gas showed that it contained CO, a fact which may be indicative of the involvement of a carbonyl intermediate lH3N BH2CO which could undergo subsequent hydrolysis to yield CO and H2.That compound ammonia carboxyborane H3N H2BC O OH is reasonable thermally stable was demonstrated by heating 0.778 mmol H3N H2BC O OH in an evacuated flask at 60 0C for for 8 hours when only 0.55 mole was found to be decomposed. Significant antitumor activity observed following the procedures described by C. Piantadosi et al in theJournal Pharm. Sci., Vol. 58, p.821 1969 . The control in this screen, 6 mercaptopurine, showed 99 inhibition.Additionally, significant antihyperlipidemic activities where serum cholesterol was assayed by means of the Lieberman Burchard reaction. The control in this assay, clofibrate, which requires 300 mg kg for significant antihyperlipidemic activity, showed 98 inhibition. In each of the tests evaluating the antiturnor and antihyperlipidemic activities a dose of 20 mglkg per day of H3N H2BC O OH was administered to CF1 male mice the LD50 is greater than 0.2 grams kg. In the Ehrlich Ascites screen, inhibition of tumor growth was 76.5 for H3N H2BC O OH, while lowering of the serum cholesterol level was 44 after 9 days and 60t after 16 days. EXAMPLE IIDimethylamine carboxyborane CH3 2NH.H2BC O OH DescriptiveDiscussion Synthesis, X Ray Crystal Structure, andAntitumor Activity of Dimethylamine carboxyborane the Boron Analogue of N,N Dimethylglycine The biologically active boron analogue ofN,N dimethylglycine, He2NH BH2COOH, was prepared by an amine displacement reaction on Me3N BH2COOH and has been structurally characterized by single crystal X ray analysis. Preparation of dimethylamine carboxyborane was achieved by the interaction of 10 parts dimethylamine with 1 part of trimethylamine carboxyborane CCH 3N.BH2C O OH in a steel bomb at room temperature for a period of 15 days.Unreacted trimethylamine carboxyborane was removed by dissolution in CHCl3 at room temperature, leaving dimethylamine carboxyborane which could be recrystallized from hot CHCl3. Yields of dimethylamine carboxyborane up to 80 can be obtained by extended reaction. Satisfactory analytical data were obtained m.p. 105 C. decomp. nu Nujol NH 3220 sh OH 3160 BH 2370 s , 2290 m CO 1640 s cm 1 delta NMe2 2.45 ppm in D20, taking delta HOD 4.70 ppm as reference.The structure was confirmed unequivocally by single crystal X ray analysis Crystal data C3H1OBNO , M 102.93, monoclinic, o space group P21 c, a 10.548 5 , b 6.600 3 , c 9.395 5 A, beta 3 90.98 5 0, U 654.0 A3, Z 4, D 1.045 g cm 3. c Intensity data to theta 670 were recorded on an Enraf NoniusCAD 3 automated diffractometer Ni filtered Cu K radiation, 0 alpha lambda 1.5418 A theta 2 theta scans . The structure was solved by direct methods. Atomic positional and thermal parameters anisotropic B, C, N, 0 isotrophc H were refined by fullmatrix least squares calculations to R 0.066 over 885 statistically significant reflections. In the crystal the dimers are further associated through N H. . .0 hydrogen o bonding N. . .0 2.867 A . Although dimethylamine carboxyborane is stable in air, the m.p. loses its sharpness when it is kept in normal laboratory conditions for a long time other spectroscopic properties remain the same. It is also thermally quite stable when heated in an evacuated flask at 600C for 8 hours1 it partly sublimed with only ca. 0.7 evolution of H2. The considerable hydrolytic stability of dimethylamine carboxyborane was demonstrated by the fact that a ca. 0.p5M solution thereof in H20 produced only ca. 1.5 of the theoretical amount of H2 after 2 days assuming complete decomposition to H2 , ca. 2.0 in one week, and 4.4t in three weeks. Moreover, dimethylamine carboxyborane was found to be stable in strong base as no measureable amount of H2 was evolved in 7 days from a ca. 0.06 M solution thereof in 1 N NaOH.On the other hand, however, dimethylamine carboxyborane is readily hydrolyzed by 1 N HC1 as indicated by the liberation of more than the theoretical amount of gas within 2 days the i.r.spectrum of the generated gas showed that carbon monixide CO had been liberated in addition to H2. Evolution of CO in this case may be indicative of a second reaction pathway with acid according to equation 1 . The intermediate, Me2NHBH2CO , EMI10.1 could undergo subsequent hydrolysis to give CO and H2 in a manner similar to the reported hydrolysis of BH3CO. In the Ehrlich Ascites antitumour screen, dosages of 33.3 mg kg per day of dimethylamine carboxyborane into CF1 male mice resulted in inhibition of tumour growth of 94.6 the LD50 for this compound is in excess of 200 mg kg. EXAMPLE IIIMethylamine carboxyborane CH3NH2H2BC O OH DescriptiveDiscussion Synth esis, X Ray Crystal Structure, andBiological Activity of Methylamine caroyborane, the Boron Analogue of Sarcosine The boron analogue of sarcosine N methylglycine , MeNH3 BH2COOH, was prepared by an amine displacement reaction on Me3N BH2COOH, and structurally characterized by single crystal X ray analysis biological as says indicate that this compound has significant anti tumour and antihyperlipidemic as well as moderate antiinflammatory activity. The existence of a class of isoelectronic and isosteric boron containing alpha amino acid analogues possessing biological activity would be expected to have considerable impact on many scientific and medical fields.Directed towards our goal of synthesizing boron analogues of the common alpha amino acids, we have discovered the synthesis, X ray crystal structure, and biological activity of methylamine carboxyborane, McNH2BH2COOH, the boron analogue of sarcosine N methylglycine . Preparation of methylamine carboxyborane was achieved by the interaction of 10 parts of methylamine with with 1 part Me3N.BH2COOH in a stainless steel bomb at room temperature for 15 days. The unreacted trimethyamine carboxyborane was removed by dissolution in hot CHC13, leaving methylamine carboxyborane which could be recrystallized from cold H20 the yield before recrystallization was more than 95 .Satisfactory analytical data were obtained m.p. 108 9 C 1 decomposed i.r.

Single crystal X ray analysis established the structure of methylamine carboxyborane unequivocally.Monoclinic crystals of methylamine carboxyborane belong to space group P21 c, a 5.125 2 , b 5.509 3 , o o c 17.289 8 A, beta 99.91 5 , U 481 A, Z 4, 3 d 1.228 g cm . The structure was solved by direct c methods disclosed in the article by G. Germain et al cited above. Full matrix least squares refinement of atomic positional and thermal anisotropic B, C, N, O isotropic H parameters converged to an R value of 0.039 over 690 statistically significant I greater than 2.0 sigma I reflections measured on an Enraf NoniusCAD 3 automated diffractometer Ni filtered Cu K alpha o radiation, lambda 1.5418 A theta 2 theta scans .The conformation and molecular dimensions of the centrosymmetric dimers were found in the solid state.As with trimethylamine carboxyborane the intradimer o hydrogen bonded 0. . .0 separation at 2.688 A in methylamine carboxyborane is slightly longer than the 0 corresponding value of ca 2.64 A which is found in simple carboxylic acids. The dimers are further associated in the crystal by weak N H. . . O hydrogen bonds N. . . O 3.101 and 3.102 . Compound methylamine carboxyborane proved to be fairly stable in air as evidenced by the fact that although prolonged exposure to normal laboratory conditions resulted in a slight lowering of the m.p., the i.r. spectrum remained unchanged. In water, slow decomposition of methylamine carboxyborane occurred typically, a 0.0443M solution thereof in water produced 1 4 of the theoretical amount of H2 after 3 hours assuming complete decomposition to H2 , 1.7 in 21 hours, 2.4X in 7 days, and 2.9 in 14 days. Slow decomposition of methylamine carboxyborane also took place in 1N NaOH solution a 0.0423M solution thereof in 1N NaOH liberated no gas in 3 hours, 0.25 of H in 18 hours, and 0.85 in 7 days. In contrast to its relative stability in water and NaOH solution, methylamine carboxyborane is sensitive to acid.Rapid decomposition of methylamine carboxyborane in 1N HC1 was accompanied by the generation of greater than the theoretical amount of H2 in 24 hours the i.r. spectrum of the generated gas showed that carbon monoxide CO was liberated in addition to H2.Evolution of carbon monoxide may be indicative of a reaction pathway with acid whereby formation of the intermediate MeNH2.BH2CO is followed by its hydrolysis to yield CO andH2 in a manner similar to the reported hydrolysis of BH3CO.Methylamine carboxyborane is thermally fairly stable on heating a sample thereof in an evacuated flask at 600C for 8 hours, only 0.6 mole evolution of H2 was observed. Significant anti tumour and antihyperlipidemic activities were demonstrated when dosages of 20 mglkg per day of methylamine carboxyborane were administered to CFl male mice the LD5010 is greater than 1 g kg. In theEhrlich Ascites screen, inhibition of tumor growth was 94Z for methylamine carboxyborane, while lowering of the serum cholesterol level was 34 after 9 days and 33Z after 16 days. Moderate antiinflammatory activity 46 inhibition by a dosage of 20 mg kg of methylamine carboxyborane was also indicated.
