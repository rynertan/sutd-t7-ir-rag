# An ear tag for marking animals.

## Abstract
The ear tag comprises a male part 1 having a stem 4 with a head portion 6 at one end, the head portion 6 forming an external shoulder 8 , and a female part 12 with an opening 16 through which the head portion can be passed. The area surrounding the opening 16 forms a shoulder 24 which engages with the shoulder 8 of the head portion to lock the head portion in place. A hollow boss 18 is formed with the female part and encloses the opening 16 and head portion when it has been passed through the opening. A collar 26 is located within the boss 18 , this collar having an internal rim 30 which abuts the shoulder 24 of the female part. The collar 26 is made of material which has a softening temperature higher than that from which the boss 18 is formed and is deformable to enable said head portion 6 , when engaged through said opening 16 , to pass the internal rim 30 and become located with the collar such as to be retained by the collar within the boss 18 .
