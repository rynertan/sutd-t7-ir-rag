# Asynchronous multiplex system.

## Abstract
An asynchronous multiplex system allows full duplex communication between a plurality of terminals 18 28 each provided with a universal, asynchronous receivertransmitter UART 42 52 which serially receives data information from a source thereof and is operative to produce a flag signal indicat ing that all of the bits of a data word have been received for storage therein and are ready for transmission. The multiplex system includes a transmitter section 68 and receiver section 88 servicing a group of data terminals 18 28 . The trans mission section includes a scanner 66 which sequentially in terrogates the UARTS associated with each of the correspond ing data terminals, and control logic 70 for causing the data words stored in a UART to be delivered to a transmission shift register 74 for temporary storage. The transmitter section further includes an encoder 78 which develops a data code identifying the particular terminal from which the data word is being transmitted. The control logic 70 causes the data word and corresponding code to be simultaneously transmitted as a single, multi bit data message over a transmission path 12 to the receiving section of another multiplexer servicing another group of terminals. The control logic 70 functions to suspend the scanning process until the transmission shift register 74 is emptied by transmission of the previous data message. The receiving section 88 of each multiplexer includes a pair of shift registers 94, 98 for respectively receiving and storing the data word and data code portions of a data message origi nating from a terminal in another group thereof, and is pro vided with control logic 96 for delivering the data word to a terminal 18, 28 identified by the data code.
