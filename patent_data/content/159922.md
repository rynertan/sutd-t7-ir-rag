# AQUEOUS FABRIC SOFTENING COMPOSITION

## Abstract
An aqueous fabric softening composition containing less than 10 cationic softener also includes an alkoxylated fatty acid amide containing less than 5 alkylene oxide groups per molecule, such as tallow ethanolamide or diethanol amide in an amount such as 110 , together with an ionic salt of Li , Ca , Mg or Al . The compositions exhibit low viscosities which are stable on storage.
