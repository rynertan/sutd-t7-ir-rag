## Description
BE1iZOHETEROCYCLIC CARBAMATES We have found that benzoheterocyclic carbamates are active antilipolytic agents as evidenced by the myocardial lipase and the rat adipocyte assays. Lipolysis is associated with ischemic heart disease free fatty acid has a detrimental effect on the ischemic heart by disrupting electrical conduction, decreasing myocardial efficiency and preventing the transfer of adenosine diphosphate and adenosine triphosphate, in and out, respectively, of the mitochondria. Interventions which depress myocardial oxygen consumption in animals and man provide a protective effect against ischemic injury. This invention provides compounds capable of inhibiting lipolysis associated with ischemic heart disease. It has been found that benzoheterocyclic carbamates are active antilipolytic agents, while the structurally related compounds, 8 quinoline carbanilates, are known in the prior art as fungicides, pesticides, amebicides and bactericides. Compounds of the StructureEMI2.1 and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein R and R1 are each , alkyl, alkoxy, carboxyl, carbalkoxy, trifluoromethyl, halogen, nitro or hydroxy X is 0, N, S or C Y is 0, N or S and R2 is H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, or heteroaryl, are useful in the treatment of ischemic heart disease and hypertriglyceridemia. The alkyl group and the alkyl moieties in alkoxy and carbalkoxy contain from I to 10 carbon atoms and may be a straight or a branched chain. Such groups include for example methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, amyl, and isoamyl. The halogen is F, CI, Br or I. The aryl group may be unsubstituted or substituted with up to 3 of the following substituents alkyl, alkoxy, carboxyl, alkylcarboxy, trihalomethyl, halogen, nitro or hydroxy. The heteroaryl is selected from the group consisting of tetrazolyl, pyridyl, furanyl, thienyl or imidazolyl. The compounds of this invention are prepared by condensing a hydroxy compound of formula IIEMI3.1 with an isocyanate R2 NCO in the classical manner to form the corresponding carbamate compound of formula I herein.The substituents R, R1 X, Y and R2 are as previously defined except that R, R1 and R2 should not include groups which are reactive with the aforesaid isocyanate under the reaction conditions employed. Such reactive groups should be blocked, preferably with groups that are readily removable after carbamate formation if the reactive groups are desired on the final product. Blocking groups include, for example, acyl groups, e.g. acetyl, or ether groups such as methyl or benzyl which can be readily removed after carbamate product formation as is well known in the art. The reaction is accomplished by merely contacting the reactants preferably in an organic solvent and in the presence of a base such as an organic tertiary amine e.g.pyridine, triethylamine, and similar amines, conveniently at room temperature, although temperatures from OOC to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture can be used. The use of high temperatures will materially shorten the reation time but may lead to secondary reactions and is therefore not preferred. The reaction can be followed by known methods using aliquots of the reaction mixture to determine the amounts of isocyanate still present. Usually, the reaction is allowed to proceed for from about one hour to several hours to assure completeness of reaction. The product is isolated from the reaction mixture using standard methods, e.g. evaporation of the solvent, and purification by chromatographic techniques.

Myocardial Lipase AssayAll compounds were dissolved in DMSO final concentration 3.0 and tested in duplicate at a concentration of 100 mart. Canine cardiac lipases were obtained by extracting washed heart membranes with buffer plus heparin and a small amount of Triton X 100 detergent. Because these enzymes are only active at an oil water interface, the enzyme reaction is run in an oil water emulsion that contains triolein substrate,Tris buffer 50mM, pH 6.8 and a small amount of bovine serum albumin 0.5 added to stabilize the emulsion. A small amount of tritiated triolein was added to the unlabelled triolein substrate. Tritium labelled oleic acid released by the lipases was extracted into hexane, separated from unreacted triolein and counted in scintillation counter. Inhibitory agents reduce the amount of radioactivity appearing in the free fatty acid fraction isolated in the extraction procedure. Rat Adipocyte AssayAbdominal fat pads were removed from male rats weighing 200 250 grams and placed in Krebs bicarbonate buffer gassed with 95 2 58 CO2 The fat pads were digested with collagenase for 1 hour at 370 C, washed twice withKrebs bicarbonate buffer and distributed among a set of 20 ml plastic counting vials. Two such vials received only buffer and cells 4m1 but no agonists or antagonists. The remaining vials received epinephrine 3cm plus the phosphodiesterase inhibitor methylisobutylxanthine 10 AM . Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO or water to a concentration of 20 cm and 40 1 was added to the buffer plus cells in the counting vials. The final compound concentration for routine screening was 200 F final concentration of DMSO 1 .The cells were incubated for I hour at 370C under a 95 2 5t CO2 atmosphere. The incubation was stopped by placing the vials in crushed ice. The cells and medium were transferred to test tubes, centrifuged and the cell layer removed by aspiration. The aqueous phase was assayed for glycerol using the enzyme glycerol dehydrogenase. The glycerol dehydrogenase assay for glycerol depends on the enzyme catalyzed conversion of glycerol to glyceraldehyde and ILIAD to NADH. The assay can detect as little as 5 10 nanomoles of glycerol. The aqueous phase, following removal of cells, usually contained about 50 to 80 nanomoles of glycerol per 300A1 of assayed sample if no inhibitory activity was present. Samples from the control tubes no agonist usually contained 0 5 nanomoles of glycerol per 300 of of sample. In Vivo Lipolysis AssayThis assay is based on the general concepts described byLovisolo et al. Lovisolo, P. P., Briatico Vangosa, G.,Orsini, G., Ronchi, R. and Angelucci, R.

Pharmacological Research Communications 13 163 174 1981 Sixteen male rats 200 300 grams are marked with a color code to facilitate individual identification during the course of the experiment. Each assay is to include 4 nonfasted control animals. The remaining animals are fasted for 22 hours water ad libitum . Test compounds are prepared either in methocel S 2 or methocel plus DMSO S 3 . After 22 hours of fasting the animals are injected i.p. at five minute intervals with either 2 ml of carrier solution S 2 or 3 or 2 ml of carrier solution plus test compound. This procedure is carried out on animals lightly anesthetized with ether.Two hours after drug injection, at 5 min intervals, the animals are again lightly anesthetized and the abdominal cavity is opened. Blood is withdrawn from the inferior vena cava through a 16 gauge needle into a 20 ml syringe. No anticoagulant is used. The blood is transferred immediately to 12 ml plastic centrifuge tubes. The blood is allowed to coagulate at room temperature for 1 hour. The tubes are then centrifuged at 4000 x g 3000 rpm for 10 min in an RC 3Sorval refrigerated centrifuge. The clear serum 3 4 ml sample is transferred to the siliconized vacutainer tubes, labeled and stored at 700C. The serum samples are analyzed for determination of unesterified fatty acids.
