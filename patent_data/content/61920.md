# Methods of aligning optical liquid level indicators.

## Abstract
A water level indicating assembly 10 has an optical system 22 for establishing an optical signal indicative of water level, which signal is split by a beam splitter 18 to transmit the majority of the optical signal to a fibre optic cable 16 and to reflect a part of the signal to a proximately located display means 13 in the form of a glass diffuser 14 . An end 24 of the cable 16 is reflected in the beam splitter 18 to form a reflection 24 which varies in intensity as the end 24 of the cable 16 is moved with the brightest reflection 24 appearing when a lamp 26 of the optical system 22 is in line with the end 24 of the cable 16 .
