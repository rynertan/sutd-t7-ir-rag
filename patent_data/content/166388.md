# Process for the production of pitch type carbon fibers.

## Abstract
A process for producing pitch type carbon fibers, which comprises melt spinning pitch material through spinning nozzles, followed by infusible treatment and carbonization and optionally by graphitization, characterized in that a packing layer is provided ad an upstream portion of each nozzle, and the pitch material is passed first through the packing layer and then through the nozzle for spinning.
