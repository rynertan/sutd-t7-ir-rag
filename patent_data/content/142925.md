# Precision roll coater.

## Abstract
A roll type coater for applying a coating material to a web of paper 30 includes an actuator mechanism for accurately controlling the movement and position of a metering roll 14 with respect to a coating transfer roll 22 , to prevent shock loading of the transfer roll upon closing movement of the metering roll 14 , and to provide for rapid opening of the metering roll when necessary. The mechan ism includes a bellcrank 50 and link 52 connected to move the metering roll 14 along guideways 11 , in which the linkage approaches, but does not exceed, an overcenter position just before the metering roll comes into contact with one or more micrometer blocks which space it accurately from the coating roll. A movable stop 70 is provided which engages the bellcrank 50 just prior to closing of the rolls, to absorb the impact and prevent the same from being transferred to the adjacent rolls and retracts, permitting final rotation of the bellcrank and the associated movement of the metering roll into its final metering position, with the loads all stacked in one direction. The movable stop may be operated against the bellcrank to open up the nip between the rolls, when necessary.
