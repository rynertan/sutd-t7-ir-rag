# Compact vacuum cleaner.

## Abstract
A vacuum cleaner 10 is constructed of relatively rigid, molded plastic main structural elements including a dirt col lecting tank 12 and a motor housing 14 releaseably secured to each other by a buckle 35. The main structural plastic ele ments also include a fan housing 30 wherein a centrifugal fan 51 rotates, a mounting plate 55 to which the motor 25 is secured, and a baffle member 60 having a cup formation which receives the rear of the motor 25. A common fasten ing means 121 mechanically secures the fan housing 30, the plate 55, and the baffle member 60 to the motor housing 14. A releaseable latch 34 is at one end of the buckle 35 and a hook 33 at the other end thereof. The latch 34 holds the tank 12 and motor housing 14 together, and the hook 33 is for en gaging a wall bracket 110 to mount the cleaner 10 in a ver tical position. The buckle 35 also includes a skid portion 32, located between the latch 34 and hook 33, to facilitate move ment of the cleaner 10 along a horizontal supporting surface 31. Hundreds of relatively small apertures 95 in the mount ing plate 55 are arranged in a narrow band adja cent the periphery of the fan 51 so as to provide for the pas sage of air through the motor mounting plate 55 without creating excessive back pressure while maintaining quiet conditions in spite of high speed air flow.
