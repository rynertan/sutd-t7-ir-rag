# PREPARATION OF ALCOHOLS

## Abstract
Alcohols, such as aromatic and aliphatic alcohols, are prepared by reducing the corresponding aldehyde with an alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme and with a cofactor for the enzyme. The enzyme is immobilised by covalent bonding to a support material to ameliorate the problem of its inhibition by the aldehyde and hence increase its active life. The enzyme is preferably an enzyme of Enzyme Commission class 1.1.1.1. such as yeast alcohol dehydrogenase YADH or horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase HLADH . The support material may, for example, be agarose or an oxirane acrylic polymer.
