# Single mode single polarization optical fiber.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a single mode single polarization optical fiber which is capable of functioning as an in line fiber polarizer which allows only one polarization of the fundamental mode to propagate along the fiber. In structure, the fiber comprises a central core region 10 a cladding region 12 which is substantially in contact with the central core region and a surrounding region 12, 14 . The various regions are formed such that the refractive index of an outer cladding region is greater than the refractive index of an inner cladding region but less than that of the core region. The arrangement of the present invention produces stress birefringence between the cladding and surrounding regions and the central core region sufficient to split the two orthogonal polarizations n
