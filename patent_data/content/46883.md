# Multiple spindle rotary indexing machine tool.

## Abstract
The multiple spindle machine tool system comprises a fixed base 10 and a central, upwardly projecting column 11 . A worktable 12 is mounted on the base 10 , for incremental, rotary indexing movements about the column 11 and carries a number of rotatable work holding chucks or spindles 13 , which are pregressively indexable with the worktable from a loading station through a series of work positions. At each work position, a separate tool slider 14, 14a is mounted on the column 11 . At all of the work stations save the one next preceding the loading station, the several tool slides 14, 14a are driven from a common motor 17 , which is also utilized to effect rotation of the spindles 13 at all stations except the final work station, and also to index the worktable 12 through successive rotary incre ments after each machining step. One work station is provided with a tool slide 14a with independent, numerical ly controlled motors 107 and 108 for X and Y axis movement, and a third independent motor 93 for spindle rotation.
