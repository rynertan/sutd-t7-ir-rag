# Non catalytic process for reducing no emissions of combustion effluents.

## Abstract
A non catalytic combustion process for reducing NO emissions to the atmosphere wherein a reducing gas comprising ammonia, either alone or in combination with one or more other reducing gases, is injected into a flowing combustion effluent containing NO and oxygen when at least a portion of the combustion effluent is in a reduction zone at a temperature within the range of from about 700 C to about 1100 C, and placing a metallic material substantially at the end of the reduction zone to substantially reduce ammonia breakthrough.
