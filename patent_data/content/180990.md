# IMPROVED ADDRESSING FOR A MULTIPOINT COMMUNICATION SYSTEM FOR PATIENT MONITORING

## Abstract
A method for dynamically assigning addresses to new modules as they are coupled to a communication system 100 with a synchronous data link control SDLC bus is described. These modules communicate with a display unit via the SDLC bus. The SDLC bus is controlled by a primary station 102 in the display unit, with all modules acting as secondary stations 104, 106, 108 . The primary station 102 periodically broadcasts a time tag to all modules at a thirty two hertz rate. At power up, each module obtains a number, modulo 16, derived from the lower four bits of its unique twenty four bit serial number. The module uses this number as a count of the number of time tags which must occur before the module responds to the primary with an address request. If there are no collisions with other modules, the primary sends the module a packet which assigns the module the next available address. In the event of a collision i.e., two or more modules request an address at the same time , the primary SDLC controller detects a CRC error and ignores the SDLC frame. The modules will each time out and obtain a new number, modulo 16, derived from the next significant four bits of the module serial number. This process continues until the module obtains an address.
