# Reflection type optical focusing apparatus.

## Abstract
A reflection type optical focusing apparatus comprising an optical focusing system including at least two 4th degree surface reflectors 30, 31 with their revolving symmetric axis formed by a line connecting the position of a point source A1 and the point source focusing position A2 , said reflectors being used in combination so that the light emitted from a point source placed at the point source position is focused to form a virtual point source at the point source focusing position, and a 4th degree surface reflector 32 with its cross section, on a plane including the revolving symmetric axis, forming a part of an ellipse with its major axis having a certain inclination with respect to the revolving symmetric axis, said virtual point source being located at one focal point A2 of the ellipse so that a light image in the shape of an arc band 12 is obtained.
