## Description
INTRAGONADAL REGULATORY PROTEIN This invention relates generally to the field of biochemistry, and more particularly to the chemistry and physiology of gonadal function. The term gonad refers to the mammalian reproduction system, and includes both the testis and the ovary.The function of these glands is dependent upon the interrelationship of a number of hormones and proteins, many of which are found, in varying amounts, in both sexes. The ovary is the essential female reproductive organ in which eggs are produced. In vertebrates there are commonly two ovaries, suspended from the dorsal surface of the broad ligaments, one on each side of the uterus. Adult human ovaries are composed of a fibrous vascular stroma in which are imbedded the Graafian follicles, which contain the eggs. The eggs are discharged by the bursting of the Graafian follicles on the surface of the ovary and are then immediately received into the mouth of the oviduct. Thereafter, the eggs flqw through the fallopian tube to the uterus, covered by a mucous membrane known as the endometrium, where the fertilized ovum develops. The egg cells or ova are periodically matured in the ovaries at intervals of approximately four weeks. At the end of each four week period, one egg reaches maturity and passes into one of the fallopian tubes. The egg descends gradually and remains viable for a short while, and during this time fertilization may take place. Within the ovary, there is a layer of cells called the germinal epithelium. Here, the potential egg begins its existence and continues to develop until a primary follicle, i.e., a group of cells isolated from the main layer, is formed around the potential egg. During a lifetime, each human ovary forms between 200,000 and 400,000 follicles. Of all these potential eggs only a few develop into mature eggs, most of them degenerating. The primary follicle that does not degenerate increases in size, and the egg cell itself enlarges up to thirty times its original size. Other changes occur in the areas adjacent to the follicle. As the follicle matures, it moves toward the surface of the ovary and when the maturation process is complete, the follicle protrudes from the surface. At this time, ovulation occurs, i.e., the follicle bursts and the egg is expelled from the surface of the ovary. The developing follicle produces sex hormones by metabolizing pre hormones using a series of enzymes 3p ol dehydrogenase, l hydroxylase, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and aromatase. Aromatase is a central enzyme in the production of sex hormones referred to as estrogens estradiol, estrone and estriol . Estrogenic hormones play a particularly important role in both the menstrual cycle and the reproductive cycle. Although 1y estradiol is the principal estrogenic hormone, a number of other estrogenic substances have been isolated, including estriol and estrone. These hormones induce the growth of the vaginal epithilium, secretion of mucous by the glands of the cervix and initiate the growth of the endometrium. The corpus luteum, which fills a rupturedGraafian follicle in the mammalian ovary, produces at least three hormones, progesterone, 17B estradiol and relaxin. Progesterone acts to complete the proliferation of the endometrium, which was initiated by the estrogenic hormones, and to prepare it for the implantation of the ovum. This reproductive cycle is well regulated as long as the production and secretion of both the sex hormones from the ovaries and the gonadotropic hormones of the pituitary gland are within normal limits. The anterior lobe of the pituitary, by manufacturing and secreting the gonadotropic hormones, controls the production of the sexual hormones in the ovaries and stimulates the development of the reproductive organs and the maintenance of their structure. The ovaries, The gonadotropic hormones have been determined to be proteins, with variable amounts of carbohydrates, and their structures are known. The molecular weight of human LH is about 26,000, and that of human FSH is about 30,000. The cellular response to gonadotropic hormones is translated through cellular receptors.These receptors are located within the cell membrane and are specific for each gonadotropin, thus, LH only activates LH receptors and FSH only activates PSH receptors. Non abortifacient means for the avoidance of pregnancy include oral contraceptive medications which contain estrogen and or progesterone like steroidal sex hormones. These medications, by raising the level of sex hormones in the blood stream, generate a cervical mucous which is hostile to spermatazoa.With increased levels of such hormones the endometrium tends to resist implantation of the fertilized ova.Further, the excess hormones provided by oral contraceptives directly inhibit the release of LH and FSH by the pituitary. As such, the ovarian cycle is disrupted and ovulation does not occur. The complications of such steroidal contraceptive medications, e.g., nausea, vomiting, weight gain, hypertension and tumor stimulation, adverse effects on calcium and phosphate metabolism, are well known and need not be discussed at length.However, these side effects result not only from the abnormally high levels of steroidal hormones in the blood stream, but from disruption of the hormonic homeostatis of the organism, i.e., the cycle of hormone adjustment between the ovary and the pituitary gland. under control of the gonadotropic hormones, produce the female sexual hormones. In turn, the rate of production of gonadotropins by the pituitary is influenced by the production of sex hormones. The effects are mutual and the two glands maintain an exact balance in hormone production. More specifically, the follicle stimulating hormone FSH from the pituitary stimulates the Graafian follicles, which thus produce estrogens. Estrogens not only inhibit FSH production through negative feedback on the pituitary, but also stimulate the pituitary to increase its production of luteinizing hormone LH through positive feedback. This hormone LH in turn brings about ovulation of the Graafian follicle. After the ova are discharged, the LH stimulates the empty follicle, now the corpus luteum, to produce progesterone. This hormone brings about the changes in the reproductive organs required for the development of the embryo. The progesterone then partly inhibits the pituitary from producing more LH. Thus, there is no further ovulation. The subsequent fall in progesterone then releases the pituitary inhibition allowing for the production of FSH to begin the process anew. When pregnancy occurs, the placenta of the embryo itself produces human chorionic gonadotropin hCG , which stimulates the continuing production of progesterone from the corpus luteum, thus preventing menstruation and stimulating the continuing development of the uterus. This progesterone also inhibits further ovulation in spite of the presence of the hCG from the placenta. Accordingly, it has been a desideratum to provide a contraceptive medication which permits the regulation of the ovarian process without an accompanying disruption of the hormonic homeostatis of the organism. While sex hormones are commonly referred to as male androgenic and female estrogenic hormones, these substances, including the proteinaceous substances associated therewith, are each important in the regulation of both the male and the female reproductive systems. For example, the luteinizing hormone LH and follicle stimulating hormone FSH play important roles in the regulation of the testis. These gonadotropins are synthesized and released in the male pituitary under the regulation of a hypothalamic peptide luteinizing hormone releasing hormone which is synthesized in the hypothalamus. LH binds to the surface receptors on the Leydig cells and promotes increased testosterone synthesis.It should be noted that testosterone synthesis is also regulated by the prevailing estradiol concentration, with high estradiol levels decreasing testosterone synthesis. Spermatogenesis is a complex event where primitive germ cells the spermatogonia proceed through multiple cell divisions, in an orderly progression from spermatogonia to spermatocyte to spermatid, in order to form mature spermatozoa. In this progression, the intergenderal communality of the regulating hormones and proteins in the gonads is demonstrated by the fact that estrogen is a necessary component in the conversion of spermatogonia to spermatocytes. Further, the enzyme aromatase is a central enzyme in the conversion of androgens to estrogens. It should be noted that aromatase is a paracrine intragonadal enzyme that has been shown to be critical to the regulation of fertility in both the male and female gender of mammalian species. Accordingly, it has been a further desideratum to provide a facile method for the regulation of fertility in both the male and female gender of mammalian species.It should be understood that the regulation of fertility, as employed herein, refers to a method and or a composition of matter associated therewith, which enables either an increase or a decrease in mammalian fertility, that is, fertility control as opposed to mere contraception. The present invention accomplishes the foregoing objectives by providing a protein moiety which enables the intragonadal modulation of the level of aromatase in a mammalian host and thus can 1 regulate the maturation of ovarian follicles and the production of viable ova and 2 regulate spermatogenesis and the production of mature spermatozoa, without disturbing the normal level of sex hormones in the body. Specifically, a proteinaceous material or moiety having a molecular weight of from about 12,000 to about 18,000 and isoelectric points of about pH 4.0 to 4.5 and about pH 6.0 to 6.5 is provided, which inhibits intragonadal aromatase activity, modulates the intragonadal activity of 3 ol dehydrogenase, inhibits the development of granulosa cell LH receptors, and prevents the maturation of mature ova and the production of mature spermatozoa. The term protein moiety, as used herein, refers to a protein, proteins or functional operatives groups thereon which produce the described results. The production and activity of the protein moiety is interspecies, and it is both produced and effective in monotocous and polytocous mammals.In another aspect of the invention, antibodies to the novel protein are provided which inhibit the natural production of the protein moiety with a corre sponding alteration in 3,sol dehydrogenase and increase in aromatase activity resulting in the promotion of follicular development, ovum maturation and spermatogenesis. Thus, mammalian fertility may be controlled substantially independently of exogenous sex hormones and without modulating the extragonadal levels of estrogens. Further, methods are provided for the isolation, purification and production of the protein moiety, and for the use thereof in the regulation of fertility control. For convenience, the intragonadal regulating protein moiety is referred to herein as a gonadal regulating protein, and abbreviated as GRP.

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment The embodiment hereinafter set forth relates to the isolation and purification of the intragonadal protein moiety and its use in the inhibition of the activity of the aromatase enzyme, modulation of 3E ol dehyrogenase activity, regulation of mature ova and sperm formation and the production of the protein moiety by cell cultures. The protein moiety is isolated from the ovary or the testis by methods such as salt fractionation and dialysis, and purified by lyophilization and chromatography. Granulosa or Sertoli cells may be cultured to produce substantial amounts of the protein moiety, which is then similarly purified. Generally, gonadal fluid may be obtained by compression of appropriate mammalian gonads, and purified by chromatographic separation to yield GRP, although initial salt fractionation and subsequent electrophoretic separation vastly improve the separation procedure. More specifically, GRP may be extracted from biological fluids including ovaries, testis, rete testis fluid, lymph, blood, and ovarian follicular fluid from mammalian species. The preferred process for the separation and purification of GRP as set forth in the Examples is summarized as follows 1. Biological fluid is mixed with saturated ammonium sulfate to achieve a 30 558 concentration. 2. The precipitate from step 1 is re suspended in TRIS buffered saline 20 mM, pH 7.5 and dialyzed against 3 volumes of distilled water 36 hours, 4 C . 3. The retentate from step 2 is passed through a hydroxylapatite column which is subsequently washed with 2 column volumes of TRIS buffered saline 20 mM, pH 7.5 . The column is then eluted in a stepwise fashion with .025M phosphate buffered saline followed by 0.5M phosphate buffered saline. 4. The eluant from the 0.5M phosphate buffered saline is passed through a SephacrylG 200 column and eluted with TRIS buffer 20 mM, pH 7.5 . 5. The eluant from step 4 which elutes in the 40,000 molecular weight range is charged onto a Matrix gel Orange A column which was previously equilibrated with TRIS buffer 20 mM, pH 7.5 .The Matrix gel Orange A column is washed with 3 column volumes of TRIS buffer and then eluted withTRIS buffer 20 mM, pH 7.5 to which has been added 0.5M KCl. 6. The TRIS 0.5M KCl eluant from step 5 is charged onto a hydrogen ion exchange column previously equilibrated with imidazole buffer 0.25 M, pH 11 .The column is eluted with buffer over the pH range 11 3. 7. The eluant fraction corresponding to either pH 6.0 6.5 or pH 4.0 4.5 from step 6 is eluted through a TSK 3000 column with TRIS buffer pH 7.5, 20 mM by high performance liquid chromatography at 125 psi. The fraction corresponding to 35 to 37 minutes in Figure 8 analytical column and 77.8 to 78.D minutes in Figure 9 preparative column contain GRP. 8. The TRIS 0.5M KCl eluant from step 5 is layered on an agarose gel orSephadex G 25 column which have been previously charged with ampholines pH 3 8 . A current is passed through the support matrix of sufficient length and wattage to allow equilibration of proteins at their isoelectric points. The fractions recovered from these electrophoretic separations corresponding to pH 6.0 6.5 or pH 4.0 4.5 containFRP. 9. The TRIS 0.5M KCl eluant from step 5 can be charged onto a hydrophobic reverse phase column. The column can be eluted with increasing concentrations of organic reagents acetonitrile, trifluroacetic acid . GRP can be separated from the other components of step 5 eluant in this fashion using differential solubility to organic solvents. The biological effect of the moiety was assessed in laboratory animals by determining vatia tions in ovarian weight and analyzing body fluids for steriod hormones and enzyme activities. Aroratase inhibition was determined by incubating granulosa cells in the presence of a substrate and GRP and measuring the amount of estrogen formed. The 3 e ol dehydrogenase was found to be modulated by incubating granulosa cells in the presence of a substrate andGRP and measuring the amount of progesterone formed.The addition of labelled LH and FSH to in vitro granu losa cell cultures showed a decrease in LH receptors in the cells, and no change in FSH receptors. Regularly ovulatory primates were exposed to GRP and in all instances the ovarian cycle was modified, along with follicular growth, as evidenced by estrogen and progesterone levels, without the concomitant alteration of LH and FSH levels. In subsequent cycles, the primates had timely menstrual onset and showed no toxic treatment effects. Male animals were injected with GRP and exhibited reduction of spermatogenesis. Pharmaceutically effective amounts may be administered to individuals orally, by injection, membrane absorption or other means which will be apparent to those skilled in the art. A particularly advantageous method of admini stration comprises the introduction of an effective amount of the moiety to the absorbent mucous membranes. Since GRP inhibits aromatase and normal follicle maturation, it plays a central role in the ovulatory process. Accordingly blockage of the GRP activity allows for the maturation of multiple follicles to ovulatory status. The protein may be coincubated with hybrid cells in vitro to produce antibodies to proteins from different species. The antibody produced by the hybrid cultures and collected by chromatography may be injected into females thus blocking the action of the follicular protein and allowing for development and eventual ovulation of one or more follicles. Agricultural uses of a similarly prepared antibody allow for the maturation of multiple follicles in livestock which could be collected, fertilized in vitro and reinserted into a properly prepared surrogate.

Identification of the Sources and Physical Characteristics of GRPExample OneIdentification of Follicular InhibitoryProtein s in Ovarian Venous Blood Ovarian venous blood 5 ml was collected from six women aged 26, 28, 31, 36, 37 and 41 years undergoing laparotomy for indications not related to ovarian dysfunction on days 12 14 after the onset of the last menstrual period. Patients 1 3 maintained regular menstrual cycles, while patients 4 6 were anovulatory, as evidenced by oligomenonrrhea and a lack of large antral follicles in the ovarian cortex. A 25 gauge needle was inserted into the venous drainage within the infundibulo pelvic ligament, and free flowing blood was aspirated. In addition, the locus of the preovulatory follicle was determined by direct visual inspection. Peripheral serum 10 ml was collected concurrently from an antecubital vein. Serum was separated by centrifugation 800 x g for fifteen minutes of the clotted specimen and stored frozen 35C until fractionation. Concentrations of 17 estradiol in ovarian 1340, 886, and 470 pg ml and peripheral 248, 261, and 201 pg ml venous samples collected from patients 1, 2 and 3, respectively, were consistent with the preovulatory 1t estradlol levels reported for normal women.In addition, comparable samples from anovulatory patients 4 6 contained low levels of 17r estradiol in both ovarian 200 pg ml and peripheral 50 pg ml sera. Slowly thawed serum was fractionated by the dropwise addition of an equal volume of saturated ammonium sulfate under persistent agitation at 4 C. After twelve hours, the precipitate was resuspended 2 1, vol vol with 10 ammonium sulfate. After twelve hours of additional agitation and centriguation 3000 x g for 30 minutes , the supernatant was dialyzed with 10,000 molecular weight exclusion membranes against Dulbecco s phosphate buffered saline PBS 0.025 M pH 6.8 for 16 hours.The retentate was passed through a Concanavalin A linked Sepharose 4B Con A column 5 ml Pharmacia, Piscataway, NewJersey which was washed with 5 vol 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.4, then further eluted with 0.5 M methyl D mannoslde inPBS at a flow rate of 20 ml h at 4 C. Additional fractionations were performed where indicated on a Sephadex G 25 superfine column 1.6 x 50 cm Vo 60 ml 5 ml h 4iC with PBS.All Sephadex molecular weight seiving was performed using a reverse flow technique. Both Sephadex G 50 andG 25 were prepared according to the instructions of the manufacturer and equilibrated in the elution buffer.To increase resolution, the smallest of the Sephadex beads were removed by direct pipetting of the surface before degassing and column packing 10 mm H2O .Elution profiles were determined using an ISCO absorbance meter at 254 nm. The activity was assessed in twenty threeday old Sprague Dawley rats 45 55 g 2 days after hypophysectomy which were kept at 25 C with intervals of fourteen hours of light and ten hours of darkness.Animals were caged in groups of three and given rat chow and water ad libitum. Silastic implants containingDES diethylstilbestrol were prepared as follows. Ten grams of Silastic TM polymer were mixed with 3 9DES for thirty minutes at 16 C thereafter, four drops of stannous octoate catalyst were added, with an additional ten minutes of mixing. The material was passed through a Luer lock syringe id, 1 mm into a steaming. 95 C 0.9 NaCl water bath and annealed for two hours. DES containing Silastic implants 1 x 5 mm were inserted sc in the hypophysectomy incision forty eight hours before assay. The assay design consisted of three rats at each dose of reference preparation and unknown.Forty eight hours after hypophysectomy, animals were given either varying concentrations of gonadotropins LH FSH, 1 1 dissolved in 0.15 M NaCl with 1 bovine serum albumin and or equal volumes of test fractions in two divided daily doses. Twenty four hours after the initial injection, animals were sacrificed by decapitation, and ovaries were removed, trimmed and weighed on a Roller Smith balance. Rat trunk serum 178 estradiol determinations were performed by methods described in Goeblesmann et al., in Leprow et al Eds. Vasectomy Immunological and Pathologic Effects in Animals and Man, AcademicPress, New York, p. 165.Control determination of chromatography fractions containing inhibitory activity was performed by heating 56it for thirty minutes or trypsin digestion 20 mg 100 ml of representative samples for 4 hours. Figure 1 compares absorbency, at 254 nm, of the Sephadex G 50 fractions from a preovulatory ovarian venous sample of patient 1 to the bioassay results of the sample, as determined by rat ovarian weight and serum 17p estradiol concentrations. An initial peak rose to 28 absorbency units, followed by a gradual downward slop, with the emergence of a smaller second peak Ve Vo 1.42 1.55 . When these eluents were tested in the bioassays, the combined rat ovarian weights ranged from 57 100 mg, and rat serum 17P estradiol levels ranged from 70 230 pg ml throughout the initial fractions.Thereafter, fractions with aVe Vo of 1.42 1.55 corresponded to an inhibition of hMG induced ovarian stimulation in the bioassay, as evidenced by a decrease in ovarian weight 59 0.5 mg and a significant P 0.01, by paired t test decrease in serum 17P estradiol to levels less than 25 pg ml.As a consequence, these fractions were pooled and processed for dose response activity. Peripheral and ovarian venous blood collected from the ovary contralateral to the site of ovulation in patient 1 demonstrated similar G 50 elution profiles data not shown .However, when representative fractions were tested by bioassay, no reduction in ovarian weight or serum 17 estradiol was found. Further, ovarian venous blood preparations from the anovulatory patients also failed to suppress the response of the ovaries to hMG stimulation. However, ovarian venous sera from the ovulatory ovary of patients 2 and 3 had a similar SephadexG 50 elution profile. Fractions with a Ve VO of 1.48 1.60 suppressed the response of rat ovarian weight 57.4 2.1 vs. 81.2 4.5 mg P 0.05 and serum 17 3 estradiol concentrations 25 vs. 68 120 pg ml PA 0.01 to hMG stimulation. When active fractions from the G 50 eluents of patients 1 3 were heated or trypsin digested, they lost their ability to suppress ovarian weight or 178 estradiol secretion in response to hMG stimulation. Figure 2 depicts the dose response curve of ovarian weight suppression in the DES treated rat ovaries by active Sephadex G 50 fractions Ve Vo 1.42l.SS derived from patient 1. Analysis of the rat ovarian weight and serum 17 estradiol concentrations revealed insert central tendency ovarian weights , a linear dose response pattern.When these same fractions were treated with heat or trypsin, no suppression of ovarian weight was present. The isoelectric point of active fractions eluted from the Sephadex G 50 column was estimated by ampholyte displacement chromatography. Pooled aliquots 1 ml of active fractions were layered on a PolybufferExchanger 94 25 ml equilibrated to pH 7.4 with 0.025M Imidazole HCl column 0.6 x 30 cm . Fractions were eluted with Pharmalyte TM Polybuffer TM 74 HCl adjusted to pH 4.0 with HCl 1 N at 10 ml h at 4 C. Fractions that eluted at a pH greater than 7.4 were collected and rechromatographed in the same Pharmalyte column reequilibrated to pH 9.4 with ethanolamine 0.025M and eluted with Polybuffer 96 adjusted to pH 6.0 with 1 N KOH. Figure 3 compiles the active Sephadex G 25 fractions Ve Vo 1.20 1.25 pooled and developed by ampholyte displacement chromatograms from patient 1 for elution ranges pH 9 4. The bioassay results from ovarian weight and serum 170 estradiol concentrations from representative fractions suggested that the isoelectric point of the active Sephadex G 50 eleuents from patient 1 were between pH 6.2 6.5. Fractions corresponding to a pH of 6.1 6.5 manifest inhibitory activity in excess of 50 tested in the bioassay with hypophysectomized, twenty three dayold, DES treated rat ovaries receiving hMG therapy ovarian weight . Ampholyte displacement chromatography of the fractions with follicle inhibiting activity was obtained on Sephadex G 25 gel filtration fractions with V Vo 1.20 1.25. Figure 4 depicts the KaV values for the mol ecular weight standards and active Sephadex G 50 fractions from patients 1 3. Estimations of molecular weight ranged from 14,000 16,500 for patient 1, from 14,000 17,000 for patient 2, and from 16,000 18,000 for patient 3. Thus, it is seen that at least one protein which suppresses the follicle response to gonadotropins is secreted by the preovulatory ovary. Specifically, a heat and trypsin labile substance is secreted directly into the venous drainage from the ovary containing the dominant follicle which suppresses the follicular response to gonadotropins. That this protein is not secreted in large amounts by anovulatory ovaries was evidenced by the failure of the bioassay to detect inhibitory activity in the venous drainage of the contralateral ovary of patients 1 3 as well as the ovarian venous effluents from three anovulatory women.This potential intra and or interovarian regulator of folliculogenesis mediates dominance of the preovulatory follicle by an active process, such that after the selection of the dominant follicle, the gonadotropin responsivity of other follicles on the same and contralateral ovaries is suppressed.Example TwoIdentification of Follicular Regulator Protein s in Pooled Human Follicular Fluid To evaluate the role of nonsteroidal, follicular fluid proteins in folliculogenesis, the 10 55 saturated ammonium sulfate fraction of pooled human follicular fluid was dialyzed against 0.025 MTris HCl pH 7.5 using 10,000 molecular weight exclusion membranes, then passed through agarose immobilized textile dye. Activity was determined by test fraction inhibition of human menopausal gonadotropin 2 U humanLH FSH day induced ovarian weight gain, and serum estradiol increase in hypophysectomized, diethylstilbesteroltreated, twenty five day old female rats. Specifically, human follicular fluid was aspirated from regularly menstruating women aged twenty five to thirty five years undergoing ovarian hyperstimulation during participation in an in vitro fertilization protocol by treatment with clomiphene citrate 150 mg day for five days, beginning three eight days after onset of spontaneously occurring menses and hCG 5000 IU forty eight hours before aspiration .Sera were collected daily and estrogen concentrations were determined. When serum estrogen concentrations exceeded 800 pg ml, patients underwent laparoscopy for aspiration of follicles in excess of 20 mm in diameter. The follicular aspirate was immediately centrifuged 800 x g , the granulosa cells were removed and the aspirate was then frozen 57iC . Follicular aspirates from twenty such patients were pooled and provided the .hFF used throughout this study. Pooled hFF was slowly thawed and fractionated by dropwise addition of an equal volume of saturated ammonium sulfate SAS during persistent agitation at 4C. After a twelve hour incubation at 4 C, the precipitate was pelleted, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended 2 1, vol vol with 108 SAS. An additional twelve hours of agitation was followed by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for thirty minutes. The resulting supernatant was dialized using 10,000 molecular weight exclusion dialysis membranes against three changes of 0.025 M Tris HCl, pH 7.5, buffer A for sixteen hours. Insoluble material was removed from the retentate by centrifugation 3,000 x g for 30 minutes . A series of agarose triazine ring immobilized textile dyes Dye Matrix Screening Kit,Amicon, Lexicton, Massachusetts were prepared according to the manufacturer s instructions. Columns 9 x 32 mm, 2 ml bed volume containing Matrix Gel BlueA triozinyl dye Cibacron Blue 3GA , Red A Procion RedHE3B , Blue B Cibacron Brilliant Blue FBR P , OrangeA, or Green A were equilibrated with 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 , then charged with 0.5 ml aliquots of the dialyzed retentate. Unbound material was eluted with 10 ml buffer A. The bound protein was eluted with 1.5 M KCl in buffer A. Eluent fractions were dialyzed overnight against buffer A, and protein concentration determined. Eluents containing active material OrangeA bound fractions were further separated 10 ml h, 4iC on a Sephadex G 50 superfine column 1.6 x 50 cm, VO 60 ml, 5 ml h, 4 C with buffer A.Elution profiles were determined using an ISCO absorbance meter at 254 nm. For estimation of molecular weight by gel filtration, the same Sephadex G 50 column used for purification 2.6 x 70 cm, Vt 280, To 90 ml was equilibrated and developed with molecular weight standards ribonuclease A, chymotrypsin, and ovalbumin in buffer A at 10 ml h, 4 C. Fractions were then assessed for activity in the bioassay. Kav for each standard and active fraction was calculated using Vt 280,VO 90 Kav Ve Vo Vt Vo . Additional aliquots from the 10 5St SAS fraction of the hFF 10 ml were passed through aConcanavalin A linked Sepharose 4B Con A column which was washed with 5 vol of 0.5 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris HCl pH 7.4 , then further eluted with 2 M methyl D mannoside in buffer A at a flow rate of 20 ml h. Both Con A bound and unbound fractions were assessed for activity in the bioassay. Chromatography fractions containing inhibitory activity were heated 55 C, 1 h or trypsin digested 10 mg 100 ml for three hours, and then retested for bioactivity. Both Orange A bound and 10 55 SAS hFF were further purified by isoelectric focusing using aSephadex G 15 support matrix. The apparatus consisted of a 4 x 30 cm water jacketed glass column containing a 2.5 x 20 cm G 15 Sephadex bed supported by a 2.5 x 8 cmTeflon elution plug under a 25 m Millipore filter. The column was previously equilibrated with two bed volumes of a solution containing carrier ampholytes 4 of pH 3 10 and 4 of pH 2 4 in 12.58 glycerol.Cytochrome C was used as an internal marker protein pI 10.5 . The fractions were then washed into the column with 20 ml ampholyte glycerol solution. A second Millipore filter was placed on the top of theSephadex bed. A 10 ml polyacrylamide solution of 14 acrylamide, 0.3 Bis, and 50 M 1 N,N,N ,n tetramethylethylenediamine polymerized by the addition of 0.1 ml of 10 ammonium persulfate was then poured over the filter. Upon completion of polymerization twenty minutes , the column was inverted, the Teflon plug was removed, and a second acrylamide plug was layered over the bottom filter. After polymerization of the bottom plug, the column was returned to its upright position and lowered into anode buffer containing 18 sulfuric acid.The remaining upper portion of the column was filled with 1 ethanolamine. The column was cooled by recirculating water at 1 4 C throughout the procedure.Isoelectric focusing was initated at 800 constant V 16 mA and allowed to proceed to equilibrium as monitored by an eventual decline in the milliamperage to 2.5 mA 8 12 h . Thereafter, pooled column fractions 3 ml were dialyzed against buffer A to remove ampholytes before bioassay. Since an apparent isoelectric point was reproducibly determined in material isolated from the human ovarian vein blood by ampholyte displacement chromatograph in Example One, this procedure was employed with the 10 558 SAS dialyzed hFF. Pooled aliquots 10 ml were layered onto a PolybufferExchanger 94 adjusted to pH 7.4 with 0.025 M Imidazole buffer, ml h, 4 C. The column was eluted with Polybuffer 74 adusted to pH 4.0 with lN HCl. Fractions that eluted at a pH greater than 7.4 were collected and rechromatographed in the same Pharmalyte column reequilibrated to pH 9.4 with ethanolamine 0.025 M, and eluted with Polybuffer 96 TM adjusted to pH 6.0 with 1N KOH. The rats used in the bioassay were hypophysectomized and implanted as described in ExampleOne, and serum estradiol 17 concentration was determined as described previously. Control determinations no injected test fractions for unstimulated ovarian weight were 34.7 3.2 SEM mg rat and for LH FSH stimulated were 192.0 30.5 mg rat. Control levels of trunk serum estradiol were 12.5 0.7 pg ml for unstimulated rats, and 118.5 21 pg ml for LS FSH stlmulated. Where indicated, 100 inhibition equals ovarian weight and or serum estradiol concentration of mean unstimulated control values. Zero percent inhibition equals ovarian weight or serum estradiol concentration of LH FSHstimulated control rats. These results are similar to those which have been obtained with the previous application of this bioassay procedure in Example One.Tests of statistical significance wer performed by Student s t test and Duncan s multiple range analysis. Protein separation was performed using aWaters HPLC GPC Model 244 Liquid Chromatograph equipped with a 0.75 x 50 cm TSR 3000 SW gel exclusion column. A 100 ul aliquot of the dialyzed, Orange A dye ma.rlx eluent was separated on each high performance liquid chromatographic HPLC run. The proteins were eluted from the TSK column using an isocratic gradient of 0.02M PBS pH 7.0 at a flow of 0.5 ml min. The protein peaks were detected by absorbance at 280 nm with aWaters variable wavelength detector Model M 450 and molecular weight estimates of the specific follicular fluid proteins were performed using highly purified molecular weight chromatography standards of ribonuclease A, chymotrypsin, ovalbumin, and bovine serum albumin BSA . Table 1 summarizes the results of Dye Ligand matrix chromatography of the 10 55 SAS dlalyzed hFF fraction. Although Orange A bound only 17 of the charged protein, 1.5 M KCl eluted bioactive material that contained the greatest inhibition of the hMGinduced rat ovarian weight gain 89 1 6.89 SEM P 0.05 when compared to the other Dye Ligand eluents. Figure 5 depicts the chromatographic elution profile of hFF developed through Sephadex G 50 at 254 nm after SAS 10 55 cut, dialysis z10,000 molecular weight , and elution of Orange A bound material with 1.5 M KCl. Fractions 2 ml were tested in the LH FSHstimulated hypophysectomized, immature, DES treated rat for inhibition of ovarian weight, and serum estradiol concentration mean SEM . An initial peak in absorbance can be seen at Ve V0 ratio of 1.01.1, which after descending, reaches a gradual ascending second plateau Ve V0 of 1.58 1.68 . Biological activity was determined as inhibition of ovarian weight and trunk serum estradiol levels.The same column was then equilibrated with molecular weight standards and developed with buffer A, allowing for molecular weight estimation Kav log Ve Vo Vt VO for fractions containing inhibitory activity. Molecular weight of eluents containing inhibitory activity were estimated to be 13,000 18,000. Eluents from the isoelectric focusing of hFF after SAS 10 55 , dialysis and Orange A dye matrix chromatography 1.5 M KCl eluate Figure 6 were evaluated for activity in the bioassay. Only fractions in the pH range of 3.5 4.5 contained clear inhibition of ovarian weight and trunk 17 estradiol levels not shown . When isoelectric point determination was performed using ampholyte displacement chromatography Figure 7 , inhibition of rat ovarian weight was found in the pH range 4.0 4.5. In addition, a second area of inhibition in the bioassay was noted pH 6.0 6.5. . Figure 8 depicts the HPCL elution profile of the Orange A bound extracted hFF material eluted through a TSK 3,000 analytical molecular weight exclusion column. Figure 9 indicates the elution profile of the same material eluted through a TSK 3,000 preparative molecular weight exclusion column. Each of these elutidn profiles displays unique chromatographic patterns of GRP. In Figure 8, the HPLC eluent was divided into ten fractions based on peak absorbances 0 18.5 21.0 minutes void volume 1 21.0 23.0 minutes 2 23.0 25.0 minutes 3 25.0 28.5 minutes 4 28.5 32.2 minutes 5 32.2 34.0 minutes 6 34.0 40.0 minutes 7 40.0 45.0 minutes 8 45.0 49.0 minutes 9 49.0 53.0 minutes . Aromatase inhibiting activity elutes at 40 45 minutes. These fractions corresponded to the following molecular weight ranges 1, 100,000 2, 100,000 3, 70,000 100,000 7 5,500 18,000 8 2,500 5,500 9, 2,500. The retention times of peak absorbances after HPLC elution, when correlated to molecular weight standards, were highly reproducible 13 runs . When HPLC fractions were tested in the bioassay see Figure 10 , inhibition of ovarian weight gain and serum estradiol elevation were evident in rats injected with the 5,500 18,000 molecular weight fraction 78 8 SEM and 89 10 , respectively Pe0.01 as compared to the other fractions. Figure 11 shows a polyacrylamide gel, with sodium dodecyl sulfate, of the fractions shown in Figure 8 after HPLC. Columns 1 5 in Figure 11 correspond, respectively, to the columns 3 7 in Figure 8. The GRP is shown at the bottom of column 5, with a molecular weight of 15,000 to 16,000 when compared to the mole cular weight standards to the right of column 5. The standards include ribonuclease A at 14,000, and chymotripsinogen A at 22,000. In Example One, there is described a protein, in the venous drainage of the human ovary which contains the preovulatory follicle, which suppresses the folli cular response to gonadotropins. That this protein was not secreted in large amounts by anovulatory ovaries was evidenced by failure of the bioassay to detect inhibitory activity in the venous drainage of the contralateral ovary in ovulatory patients as well as both ovarian vein effluents from anovulatory women. In the present example, a comparable isolation procedure has shown a similar biological activity in human follicular fluid hFF . The rat bioassay employed to identify material in hFF which inhibits LH FSH mediated follicular stimulation was the same as that reported for human ovarian vein blood extracts.Follicular inhibitory activity in hFF had a molecular weight, determined by HPLC size exclusion chromatography 10,000 18,000 that is similar to that of follicular inhibitory activity recovered from human ovarian vein serum 14,000 17,000 . The indicated isoelectric point for inhibitory activity in human ovarian vein extract, as determined by chromatofocusing pH 5.8 6.4 , is similar to the hFF extract reported here. The follicular inhibitory substance reported here was derived from follicular aspirates of women during spontaneous ovarian cycles whose follicles were hyerstimulated by clomiphene and hCG therapy.Consequently, no conclusion can be drawn regarding this material in normally developing follicles.However, since a similar activity has been identified in the ovarian vein serum draining the spontaneous preovulatory ovary Example One these data indicate this inhibitory protein to be a product of the dominant follicle itself. Example ThreeGonadal Regulatory Protein Fractions in Porcine Follicular Fluid Example Two details the isolation of a protein fraction GRP from human follicular fluid, which suppresses follicular response to gonadotropins. The present example employs an identical isolation, bioassay and HPLC procedures with respect to porcine follicular fluid pFF . Isoelectric focusing demonstrated inhibitory activity at about pH 4.2 4.5 and pH 6.27 and peak activity was found in the molecular weight range 12,000 18,000 daltor.s. Granulosa cells were isolated from rat ovaries and FSH binding was determined by the procedure of Erickson, as described in Example Four. Aromatase activity of the rat granulosa cells was determined in a procedure identical to that described therein. Table 2 sumarizes the results of dye ligand matrix chromatography of the 10 558 saturated ammonium sulfate porcine follicular fluid fraction. AlthoughOrange A bound only 13 of the charged protein, 1.5 M KCl elution recovered bioactive material which contained the greatest inhibition of hMG induced rat ovarian weight response p .05 when compared to the other dye ligand eluents. When these same fractions were treated with heat 56 C or trypsin 10 mg , no suppression in ovarian weight was found. Figure 14 depicts the chromatographic elution profile of pFF at 280 nm developed through SephadexG 100 following the 10 558 SAS cut, dialysis, and elution of Orange A bound material with 1.5 M KCl. An initial peak can be seen at a Ve VO of 1.1 to i.17, thereafter trailing, followed by a gradual ascending second plateau at Ve VO 1.7 to 1.9. When biological activity was assessed in the HIFR hMG bioassay, 95 inhibition of both ovarian weight and trunk serum estradiol 17 B levels were found at Ve VO of 1.5.The same column was then equilibrated with molecular weight standards and developed with .025 M PBS, pH 7.4, allowing for estimation of the Kav VO Ve Ve Vo of fractions containing inhibitory activity. When eluents from the isoelectric focusing REF of the Orange A bound pFF extraction Figure 12 were evaluated for bioactivity by rat bioassay, only fractions within the range of pH 3.7 to 4.0 contained obvious inhibition of both rat ovarian weight response and trunk serum estradiol 17B levels 83.6 9.4 and 47.2 respectively . Serial dilutions of the extractedPFF fractions eluted from the Orange A dye matrix with 1.5 M KCl recovered from the isoelectric focusing column were tested for activity in the hypophysectomized immature DES treated female HIFR at bioassay. A dose response relationship was apparent Figure 13 with fractions in the pH 3.5 4.0 range, while other pH ranges from the IEF column were without inhibitory activity. When aliquots of this Orange A matrix column were separated by hydrogen ion chromatography chromatofocusing , fractions corresponding to pH 4.0 4.5 Figure 15, fraction 7 and pH 6.0 6.5 Figure 15, fraction 4 inhibited microsomal aromatase activity.When fractions 4 and 7 are further purified by HPLC molecular weight separation, aromatase inhibitory activity GRP is present in the fractions corresponding to 15,000 16,000 daltons. When aliquots from the ammonium sulfate 10 558 cut eluted from the Orange A dye matrix were passed through Concanavalin linked Sepharose 4B eluted 3 x Vo with PBS followed by 2 M alpha methyl mannoside , no inhibitory activity in the rat bioassay was noted in the Con A bound fraction i.e. eluted with mannoside with only marginal recovery of activity 20 30 inhibition of ovarian weight response in the material eluted in the unbound PBS fraction data not shown . Figure 16 depicts the HPLC elution profile of the Orange A bound extracted PFF material after separation through the Sephadex G 100 column Ve Vo 1.3 1.7 . The HPLC eluent was divided into five fractions based on peak absorbances 1 retention time 25.0 27.8 minutes 2 27.8 31.0 minutes 3 31.0 36.0 minutes 4 36.0 39.0 minutes 5 39.0 43.0 minutes .These fractions corresponded to the followina molecular weight ranges 1 100,000 74,000 2 74,000 36,000 3 36,000 18,000 4 18,000 12,000 5 12,000 5,800. The retention times of peak absorbances after HPLC elution, when correlated to molecular weight standards, were highly reproducible five runs . When HPLC fractions were tested in the bioassay see Figure 17 , inhibition of ovarian weight gain was evident in rats injected with fraction 3 74 8 p .01 and fraction 4 51 9 , p .05 as compared to the other three fractions. Inhibition of androstenedione conversion to total immunoreactive estrogen by granulosa cells harvested from the HPLC fraction treated rat s ovaries n 6 ovaries HPLC fraction was evident in HPLC fraction 3 11.1 3 pg 10,000 cells ml . When no test fractions were injected into the HIFR hMG bioassay rat prior to the aromatase assay, a range of 30 60 pg of total immunoreactive estrogen 10,000 cells ml was present in the control incubates. Figure 18 shows the results of FSH binding studies performed on the granulosa cells removed from the HIFR hMG rats used in the bioassay of the SephadexG100 fraction which contained inhibitory activity. No difference in FSH binding to the rat granulosa cells was evident between the control and inhibitor treatedHIFR hMG rats. Subsequent procedures, identical to those described in this example regarding porcine follicular fluid, have isolated GRP from bovine follicular fluid. Exanple FourIdentification of Regulatory Protein s in Human Granulosa Cell Secretions Follicular fluid was aspirated from regularly menstruating women twenty five to thirty five years old , undergoing clomiphene citrate 150 may for five days, beginning three eight days after the onset of spontaneously occurring menses and hCG 4000 IU, 36 hours before aspiration therapy during participation in an in vitro fertilization protocol. Serum was collected daily, and estrogen concentrations were determined. When serum estrogen concentrations exceeded 800 1000 pg ml, patients underwent laparoscopy for aspiration of follicles in excess of 20 mm in diameter. Follicular aspirates were immediately centrifuged 800 x g , granulosa cells were removed for culture, and the supernatant was frozen 57iC . Follicular aspirates from seven patients were evaluated. The aspirated follicular fluid volume, number of viable granulosa cells, and follicular fluid steriod concentrations from the largest follicle recovered from the seven patients are depicted in Table 2. All of the antral fluids contained high concentrations of progesterone 7 12 ug ml , indicating premature luteinizations of the. follicles 30 32 as a result of the clomiphene hCG therapy. Approximately 100,000 viable granulosa cells were obtained from each follicle. Individual hFF samples were slowly thawed and fractionated by dropwise addition of an equal volume of saturated ammonium surfate during persistent agitation at 4 C. After a twelve hour incubation at 4 C, the precipitate was recovered by centrifugation and resuspended 2 1, vol vol in 10 ammonium sulfate.An additional twelve hours of mixing was followed by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for thirty minutes.The resulting supernatant was dialyzed 10,000 molecular weight exclusion membranes against phosphate buffered saline PBS 0,025 M H 6.8 for sixteen hours at 4iC and then lophilized. The retentate 500 mg in 0.5 ml aliquots was passed through a column 9 x 32 mm bed volume, 2 ml containing agarose immobilized Orange A Dye matrix, Amicon , which had been equili brated with 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5. Unbound material was eluted with 10 ml 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5 and bound material was eluted with 10 ml 1.5 M KCl in 20 mMTris HCl pH 7.5. Bound eluent fractions were dialyzed overnight against PBS or distilled water. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al., J. Biol. Chem. 143 265. Rats were prepared for bioassay as described in the previous examples. Results of control determinations no injected test fractions were 34.8 3.2 mg rat for unstimulated ovarian weight and 122.0 13.5 mg rat for FSHstimulated ovarian weight. Control levels of trunk serum estradiol were 12.5 0.7 pg ml for unstimulated and 118.5 21 pg ml for LH FSH stimulated. Where indicated, 100 inhibition equals the ovarian weight and or serum estradiol concentration of mean unstimulated control values. Zero percent inhibition equals the ovarian weight or serum estradiol concentration of LH FSH stimulated control rats. These results are similar to those obtained during the previous examples. Tests of statistical significance were performed by Student s t test and Duncan s multiple range analysis. Figure 19 depicts the effect of extracted follicular fluid ehFF and respective granulosa cell culture media 24, 48, and 72 hours on the inhibition of LH FSH 2 IU stimulated rat ovarian weight augmentation and serum estradiol secretion 2 ml rat . Each value represents the mean SEM of three rats. All four follicular fluid extracts ehFF contained inhibitory activity, as evidenced by inhibition of both rat ovarian weight 40 65 and trunk serum estradiol concentrations 85 100 . Bioassay of culture media from the respective granulosa cell cultures collected twenty four, forty eight and seventytwo hours after plating indicated that inhibitory activity was present during the first forty eight hours of incubation. Variability in the initial twenty four hour determination of patients 2 and 3 may relate to initial plating efficiency. Importantly, all bioassay determinations were made after complete medium changes each twenty four hours. No inhibitory activity was noted after seventy two hours of culture. Figure 20 depicts the compiled mean SE bioassay results of culture media containing GRP derived from granulosa cell cultures of patients 5, 6 and 7. All media tested without gonadotropins added to the culture contained inhibitory activity of both ovarian weight and trunk serum estradiol concentrations exceeding 75 throughout the first two days of culture. Thereafter days 3 and 4 , the inhibitory activity of media from unstimulated cultures declined 43 and 37 , and 18 and 12 for ovarian.weight and serum estradiol levels, respectively . After coincubation of the granulosa cells with varying doses of LH FSH 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0U , inhibitory activity, as determined in the HIFR hMG bioassay, was markedly suppressed in all cultures after the first twenty four hours 208 . When progesterone concentrations were determined for these culture media , an inverse correlation between inhibitory activity in the bioassav and culture medium progesterone concentrations was apparent. The unstimulated cultures no added LH FSH had the least progesterone throughout the four days of culture 10 ng ml , but contained inhibitory activity Figure 20 , albeit in decreasing amounts as culture duration continued. However, after LH FSH was added to the granulosa cell cultures in increasing amounts, the progesterone concentrations rose in a dose and time .dependent pattern, while bioassay inhibitory activity declined to essentially the limits of bioassay detectabiiity Figure 20 . High performance liquid chromatography The high performance liquid chromatographic HPLC separation of follicular fluid steroids was performed. Protein separation was performed using the same Waters HPLC GPC Model 244 liquid chromatograph equipped with two Waters I 125 gel exclusion columns connected in series. A 10 aliquot of the dialyzed,Orange A dye matrix bound eluent was separated on eachHPLC run. The proteins were eluted from the I 125 columns using an isocratic gradient of 0.02 M PBS, pH 7.0, at a flow of 0.5 ml minute 800 psi . The protein peaks were detected at 280 nm, and molecular weight estimates of the specific follicular fluid proteins were performed using highly purified molecular weight chromatography standards of ribonuclease A, chymotrypsin, ovalbumin, and BSA. Granulosa cells were cultured for up to four days in twenty four hour intervals using 35 x 10 mm tissue culture dishes and 2 ml medium 199 containing 25 mM Hepes supplemented with 100 U ml penicillin, 100 fug streptomycin sulfate, and 15 fetal calf serum mediumA . Cultures were maintained in a humidified, 95 air 5 CO2incubator at 37it. After each twenty four hour incubation period, spent medium was collected and stored frozen at 20 C until bioassay was performed.Where indicated, human menopausal gonadotropin FSH LH,1 1 was added to specific cultures at the time of complete medium change. At the end of each twentyfour hour incubation period, spent medium was collected for bioassay, and 2 ml fresh medium were added. The final cell pellets were dispersed in medium A, and aliquots 0.5 ml of the cell suspension were diluted with 0.05 ml trypan blue for quantitation of viable cells in a hemocytometer. Initial plating density was 0.5 x 105 granulosa cells plate. Granulosa cells were isolated from rat ovaries and were collected by centrifugation at 800 x g at 4 C for ten minutes. FSH binding was determined using a modification of known techniques. Rat FSH, provided by the National Pituitary Agency, was labeled by the chloramine T procedure. Cells were resuspended in appropriate volumes of PBS 018 gelatin PBS gel , pH 7.0. All assays were run with three concentration of labeled hormone 100 p1 , buffer PBS 0.18 gel 100 and 100yl cells.Reactions were initiated by the addition of granulosa cells and were carried out for four hours at 25eC. Reactions were terminated by adding 1 ml cold PBS, followed by centrifugation at 30,000 x g for ten minutes. The supernatant was carefully aspirated, and the pellet was rewashed with 1 ml PBS. The final pellet was counted in a Y counter.Specific binding was calculated as the difference between binding in the presence nonspecific and absence total of an excess of unlabeled hormone. Figure 21 depicts the FSH binding studies performed on the granulosa cells removed from theHIFR hMG treated rat ovaries used in the bioassay experiments shown in Figure 19. Specific binding of rat FSH rFSH to granulosa cells was determined by incubating three concentrations of labeled rFSH in the presence and absence of excess unlabeled rFSH.Rat granulosa cell specific FSH binding was similar whether the rat received injections of spent medium from human granulosa cell cultures or saline. However, a marked difference in the ovarian weight and trunk serum estradiol concentrations of these rats was present. Replicate 0.1 ml portions of each rat granulosa cell suspension were pipetted into 12 x 75 mm polystyrene tubes. Androstenedione, the referent aromatase substrate, was added in 0.1 ml medium A final concentration, 1.0 x 10 7 M . All incubations were performed in triplicate for three hours at 37 C in a shaking water bath 120 cycles minute . The reaction was stopped by transferring the tubes to an iced water bath before centrifugation for five minutes at 1000 x g. The supernatants were decanted and stored at 20 C until measurements of estradiol and estrone were performed. Control incubations no androstenedione added were processed in the same way. Blank estrogen values obtained for the controls were subtracted from the corresponding values for incubations in the presence of androstenedione.Aromatase activity was expressed as estrogen production nanograms per viable granulosa cell . Rat granulosa cell aromatase activity is shown in Figure 22 and was markedly inhibited P 0.01 by treatment with spent media from all four days of culture 2.4 0.4, 2.9 0.7, 2.4 0.4, and 2.1 t 0.2 pg estrogen 10,000 viable cells ml, respectively, compared to saline control 4.6 0.2 pg estrogen 10,000 viable cells ml. Control determinations were performed on rat granulosa cells collected from HIFR hMG treated rats which did not receive culture medium injections.Inhibition of relative estrogen production by rat granulosa cells in the presence of 10 7 M androstenedione was seen throughout all four days of human granulosa cell culture medium treatment. Taken together, these data indicate that although no marked inhibition of rat granulosa cell FSH binding was induced by the human grandulosa cell culture medium, a clear disruption of aromatase activity occurred, which may account for the decreased rat ovarian weight and serum estradiol concentrations. Using the same purification techniques and bioassays described above, a similar protein or proteins have been identified in the culture media derived from the granulosa cells of human follicles. This data indicates that human granulosa cells secrete a protein that inhibits follicular response to gonadotropins. All of the antral fluid s steroid concentrations suggested premature luteinization. After extraction, all seven follicular fluids contained inhibitory activity, as evidenced by reduction of both rat ovarian weight 45 858 and trunk serum estradiol concentrations 85 100 in the HIFR hMG bioassay.Bioassay of these follicles granulosa cell culture media indicated inhibitory activity present during the first forty eight hours, while no inhibitory activity was noted after seventy two hours of culture. Spent culture media derived from granulosa cells cultured without additional gonadotropins contained inhibitory activity in the HIFR hMG bioassay throughout the first two days in vitro. Thereafter days 3 and 4 , inhibitory activity of media from unstimulated cultures declined. After coincubation of the granulosa cells with varying doses of LH FSH, inhibitory activity was markedly suppressed even after the first twenty four hours. An inverse correlation was apparent between inhibitory activity in the bioassay and the culture medium progesterone level.Although FSH binding of granulosa cells derived from rats used in theHIFR hMG bioassay was similar with or without injection of test fractions, their aromatase activity was markedly inhibited by treatment with human granulosa cell culture medium. These data indicate that although no marked inhibition in rat granulosa cell FSH binding was induced by the human granulosa cell culture medium, a clear disruption of aromatase activity occurred, which accounts for the decreased rat ovarian weight and serum estradiol concentrations found in the bioassay.Disruption of gonadotropin mediated aromatase induction by an intrafollicular protein may, in part, modulate the local balance between C 19 steroid aromatase and 5 reductase enzymic activities in individual follicles. A particularly advantageous method of preparing reproducing granulosa cell cultures which will produce GRP in quantity is to employ mammals which have no antibodies to foreign tissues, such as the laboratory rodent known as the nude mouse, for initial cell growth. Numerous experiments have been performed wherein an injection of about 107 granulosa cells, isolated from human, rat and other species, was administered subcutaneously to nude mice, followed by the administration of 100 mg of diethylstilbestrol an estrogen daily. After six to eight weeks, cells were recovered by aspiration with a syringe from the bleb formed by the initial injection, and the recovered cells reproduced in tissue culture. A variety of nonsteroidal regulators of ovarian function have been identified in a variety of species, including oocyte maturation inhibitor, luteinizing inhibitor, folliculostatin or inhibin, and FSH binding inhibitor. The biophysical characteristics of the intraqonadal protein of this invention are different from such substances. This material elutes through gel exclusion chromatography with a molecular weight of 12,000 4S,000, binds to Orange A dye matrix, and has an apparent isoelectric point of pH 4.0 4.5 and 6.0 6.5. These observations indicate that in addition to the intrafolicular steroidal mileau a variety of nonsteroidal compounds, secretory products of the granulosa cells or other ovarian compartments, contribute to the regulation of folliculogenesis.Example FiveThe presence of the gonadal regulating protein inTestis. Bovine testis were homogenized and the homogenate precipitated with 55 saturated ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was resuspended and dialyzed against distilled water. The retentate was eluted though Sephadex G 100 with TRIS buffer 20 mM, pH 7.5 .The eluant corresonding to a molecular weight range of 12,000 18,000 was collected and charged into an OrangeA dye matrix column. The column was eluted with TRIS buffer containing 0.5 M KCl 20 mM, pH 7.5 . This eluant contained GRP as evidenced by the inhibition of porcine granulosa cell aromatase activity Figure 23 bTEc and bTE OAB columns and rat serum estradiol levels Figure 24 BTE FSH and BTE OAB FSH columns .Further, this activity was contained in testicular extract fractions with isoelectric points of pH 4.1 4.5 and 6.0 6.5. This demonstrates that the testis and its secretory product, rete testis fluid, also containsGRP. Example SixExtraction of GRP from Sertoli Cell Cultures. Granulosa cells secrete GRP, and Sertoli cells are the embryonic homologue in testis of the granulosa cells in the ovary. Further, the biological activities of granulosa cells are present in theSertoli cells insofar as they have been identified and are relevant to gonadal function. Thus, the Sertoli cell provides an additional, readily available source of GRP. Accordingly, Sertoli cells may be grown in cell culture and the recovered culture media is extracted by the procedures described in the foregoing examples, principally salt participation, chromatographic procedures and electrophoresis. II. Biological ActivityExample SevenThe Effect of the Gonadal RegulatoryProtein as an Aromatase Inhibitor In Examples One through Six, protein s in ovarian venous effluent, human and porcine follicular fluid, testis fluid and spent media from human granulosa and Sertoli cell cultures inhibited rat ovarian weight gain in response to gonadotropin stimulation. Gonadal fluid extracts containing this protein were found to have a molecular weight of 12,000 18,000 and isoelectric points of about pH 4.0, 4.5 and pH 6.0 6.5. As inhibin, another protein secreted by human granulosa cells, increases with follicular maturation and decreases with luteinization, individual human follicles from untreated as well as hMG and clomiphene trated women were assessed forGRP activity, and that activity was correlated with the follicles follicular fluid steroid and inhibin concentrations. Follicular aspirates were obtained from women aged twenty four thirty two years who were participating in an in vitro fertilization protocol. All patients had regular ovulatory menstrual cycles based on monthly vaginal bleeding and at least a single luteal phase serum progesterone in excess of 3 ng ml.When serial ultrasonographic examinations ADR Model 2140 real time sector scanner with a 3.5 mflz rotating head transducer demonstrated a follicular diameter in excess of 18 mm laparoscopy was performed for aspiration of all follicles greater than 16 mm in diameter.Follicular aspirates were immediately transferred to an adjacent laboratory for removal of granulosa cells by centrifugation 600 x G, 15 minutes and storage of follicular fluid 37 C until assay. Follicular fluid concentrations of estradiol, progesterone, 17 hydroxy progesterone, androstenedione and testosterone were determined by established radioimmunoassay techniques. GRP was isolated from individual follicular fluid samples substantially as described in Example Two. Aromatase Activity Porcine granulosa cells were collected from fresh ovaries obtained at the local slaughterhouse. After washing in serum free HAMS HEPES tissue culture media, 5 x 105 cells in 0.2 ml of medium were pipetted into 12 x 75 mm polystyrene tubes. Triplicate 200 ul portions of each follicular fluid preparation at three different protein concentrations 700 10 ug ml were tested. Each tube then received 100 of FSH 10n g in culture medium and was incubated at 37iC in a shaking water bath for three hours. An atmosphere of 90 N2, 5 02 and 5 CO2 was maintained throughout the incubation. The incubation was stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml Hams Hepes media and centrifugation at 1000 x g for five minutes.The granulosa cells were then resuspended in 0.5 ml Hams Hepes media, whereupon 100 A of cells were assayed for armoatase activity.Androstenedione, the referent aromatase substrate, was added in 0.1 ml medium final concentration, 1.0 x 107M . All incubations were performed in duplicate for three hours at 37 C in a shaking water bath 120 cycles minute . The reaction was stopped by transferring the tubes to an iced water bath before centrifugation five minutes at 1000 x g . The super natants were decanted and stored at 20 C until measurements of estrogen were performed. Control incubations no androstenedione added were processed in the same way. Blank estrogen values obtained for the controls were subtracted from the corresponding values for incubations in the presence of androstenedione.Aromatase activity was expressed as estrogen production nanograms per viable granulosa cell . Inhibin Activity Ten percent weight volume activated charcoal Norite A was added to the individual folli cular fluids, and stirred continuously overnight at 4 C, followed by centrifugation 1000 x G, twenty minutes and sterile filtered to remove the charcoal.The charcoal stripped follicular fluid contained 10 pg ml of androstenedione, progesterone, and estradiol as determined by radioimmunoassay. Inhibin activity was determined using the degree of inhibition of basal i.e. non LHRH stimulated twenty four hour FSH secretion by dispersed rat anterior pituitary cells in primary monolayer. For each cell culture, anterior pituitary glands were obtained from 20 cycling female Sprague Dawly rats 250 300 gm body weight .During the thirty minute interval required for removal of all the pituitary glands, each gland was placed in medium pH 7.4, 20it . Pituitary glands were finely minced with scissors and incubated in a mixture containing 19 viokase, 33 collagenase, and 3 bovine serum albumin in medium buffer at 37 C for thirty to forty five minutes. The dispersed cells were counted using a hemocytometer and pituicyte viability was determined by 1 trypan blue exclusion. Typically, more than 90 of the dispersed cells were viable. The cells were diluted to a concentration of 2.5 x 105 viable cells per ml growth medium.Growth medium consisted of HAMS FlO containing 10 fetal calf serum with penicillin, fugizone and streptomycin 50 u ml and 50 mg ml and 50 mg ml respectively . Cells were added to tissue culture dishes in a volume of 2.0 ml growth media, and attachment of the cells to the well surface was completed by two days. After cell attachment, the original growth media was discarded and the cells were washed twice with additional HAMS balanced salt soluticn. Thereafter, three concentrations of charcoaltreated follicular fluid .02t, 0.2 , 24 were added to the plate.A lyophillyzed porcine follicular fluid standard PFF1 KT 1, provided by CP Channing was resuspended in water and tested in each assay at .003E, .016 ,.08 , .04 , and 2 concentrations. Twenty four hours later, the spent culture media was assayed in duplicate using the NIH RIA kit for rFSH. Data Analysis The mean estrogen concentration in the serum control tube for each GRPassay was set at 100 , and the response in each test was expressed as a percentage of the control estrogen concentration. The coefficient of variation for each group of three replicate tubes was calculated. If the coefficient was 15 , the estrogen assay was repeated and or one value of the three was discarded. A curve was constructed in which the percent inhibition of estrogen in each well was plotted vs the protein concentration of follicular fluid added. Unknown values were determined by plotting the experimentally determined values at three different protein concentrations 700 10 ug ml on a log linear graph and extrapolating the value at 50 ug ml.The percent inhibition of estradiol at 50 ug of unknown follicular fluid was read off the standard curve and expressed as percent aromatase inhibition for that follicle. For the inhibin assay, the response in each test plate was expressed as a percentage of the controlFSH concentration, which was set at 100 . The coefficient of variation of each group of three replicate plates was calculated. If the coeffient was 158 the assay was repeated. A standard curve was constructed in which the percent inhibition of FSH in standard wells was plotted vs the log of the standard added. Least squares linear regression was used to construct a standard curve in the linear portion of the dose response curve. Unknown follicular fluid inhibin values were determined by plotting the experimentally determined values 0.02 , 0.2 , 28 on a log linear graph and extrapolating the value at 1 . The percent inhibition of rFSH at 1 of unknown follicular fluid was read off the standard curve and expressed asChanning units 1 CU 1 unit of inhibin standard the inhibition of rFSH in rat pituicyte culture by 1 nl of charcoal treated, ethanol extracted porcine follicular fluid . Tests for statistical significance were performed by one way analysis of variance and Duncan s new multiple range test. Correlation between follicular fluid steroid concentration andGRP activity was performed using regression analysis with tests of statistical significance performed by t test corrected for N. Patient Outcome Seven patients underwent follicular aspiration during an untreated spontaneously occurring ovarian cycle. At the time of laparscopy, only one antral follicle was seen in each patient which was aspirated. Nine patients received clomiphene citrate therapy 150 mg day, cycle days 5 9 , providing a total of twenty four follicles with diameters 16 mm. All except one patient had multiple follicles aspirated. Six patients who underwent hMG therapy 150 IU LH 150 IU FSH administered daily beginning on cycle day 3 until follicle aspiration , provided twenty three follicles Care was taken to aspirate all follicles with diameters in excess of 16 mm. There was no difference between treatment groups in follicle size which averaged 18.7 .9 mm x SEM, range 16 24 mm . At the time of aspiration, serum estradiol levels averaged 1456 pg ml 285 pg ml for all patients studied range of 310 3200 pg ml with no significant difference between treatment groups. Validation To establish the number of porcine granulosa cells for the GEPassay, the following porcine granulosa cell concentrations were used .5 x 106, 1 x 106, 2 x 106 cells ml. The total amount of estrogen produced following a three hour incubation was 55 9, 140 27, 375 48 pg culture dish, respectively. Consequently, 2 x 106 porcine granulosa cells were used in each subsequent assay. To evaluate the effects of porcine FSH NIH P 2 reagent and follicular protein 100 ug , porcine granulosa cell cultures were prepared with or without porcine FSH added to the media .5 ml final volume , incubated at 370C for three hours in a shaker bath with 95 02 and 5 C02, after which androstenedione 10 6 M was added in .5 ml of growth media. Cultures were incubated for three hours at 37iC in a shaker bath then centrifuged 1000 x G for fifteen minutes and media collected for estrogen determination. Without FSH, the estrogen production was 439 41 pg ml with GRP added, the estrogen production was 22.4 41.7 pg ml. When 2 units ml of porcine FSH were added without GRP 728 pg ml estrogen were produced.Addition of GRP produced a dose response relationship 1000 ug GRP 200.26 pg ml 200 ug GRP 306.37 pg ml 50 ng GRP 345.41 pg ml 10 ug GRP 334 18 pg ml of estrogen.Accordingly, individual patient values were extrapolated to 50 ng ml of GRP for comparisons of activity. The GRP in elution profiles from OrangeA were analyzed using three different concentrations of KCl 0.17 M KCl yielded 3.1 mg protein ml which had a 37 inhibition of aromatase, 0.5M KCl eluted 6 mg protein ml which had an 848 inhibition of aromatase and 1.5M KCl eluted .05 mg protein ml which had a 6.78 inhibition of aromatase. Accordingly, the .5 M KCl fraction was used to elute the active material from the Orange A bound column. KCl .5M was found to have no effect in the granulosa cell aromatase assay control without KCl, 3 determinations, 710 41 ng ml. with KCl, 712 38 ng ml . Duration of incubation time was assessed with and without FSH. Two hour assay incubations yielded 2 ng estrogen ml twenty four hours 5.3 ng estrogen ml.With 2 ng FSH added, 39 ng estrogen ml at two hours and 6 ng FSH ml produced 8 ng estrogen ml at twenty four hours. With 1 ng PSH ml, 35 1.8 ng estrogen ml were produced at two hours and 4.7 .9 ng estrogen ml at twenty four hours.Accordingly, a three hour incubation was used to determine specific GRP activity. When GRP preparation was heated to 56 C x 1 hers, the inhibition of granulosa cell aromatase was lost.The GRP activity levels inhibition of porcine granulosa cell aromatase by 50 ug of follicular fluid for untreated patients was 14.16 5.328 X SEM . For patients receiving hMG, GRP levels were 18.09 3.46 , and for patients receiving clomiphene, 13.7 5.36 . There was no statistically significant difference in the values between the three treatment groups. The amount of estradiol in the follicular fluid of untreated patients was 2.59 1.2 ug ml, for patients receiving hMG therapy, .34 0.5 ug ml, for patients receiving clomiphene, 1.31 .34 ug ml. These values were all significantly different p .05, untreated vs clomiphene, clomiphene vs hMG p .01 untreated vs hMG .Progesterone values for untreated patients were 9.84 3.35 ug ml, for hMG treated patients, 5.18 1.1 ug ml, and for clomiphene treated patients, 11.3 2.3 ug ml These differences were significant for the unstimulated and hMG treated patients p C .05 and hMG vs clomiphene treated patients p .01 , The 17 hydroxyprogesterone concentrations for patients receiving no additional therapy were 1.66 .25 ug ml, for those receiving clomiphene therapy 2.6 .3 ug ml, and for those receiving hMG therapy .76 .11 ug ml. All these values were significantly different hMG vs clomiphene p .01 hMG vs unstimulated p .01 unstimulated vs clomiphene p .025 . Follicular fluid androstenedione concentrations in untreated patients were 61.9 43 ng ml. For hMG and clomiphene treated patients they were 85.5 37, and 84.8 43 ng ml, respectively. Follicular fluid testosterone levels from untreated patients were 7.34 ng ml 3.7. For the treated patients, there was no difference in the follicular fluid testosterone concentrations in patients receiving either hMG 7.09 2.14 ng ml or clomiphene 6.14 1.8 ng ml . Correlation of GRP vs Follicular Fluid Steroids There was a positive correlation between follicular fluid estradiol concentrations and GRP protein activity in untreated patients r .689, p. .01. For patients receiving hMG therapy, there was no significant correlation between GRP activity and follicular level estradiol concen trations r 490, p .l . For patients receiving clomiphene therapy, the correlation between GRP activity and follicular fluid estradiol was described by two populations using a second degree regression analysis r2 .853, p .o1 . Correlation between follicular fluid progesterone concentrations and GRP activity for untreated patients r .622, p .05 and hMG treated patients r .756, p .005 was significant. For clomiphene treated patients, correlation between follicular fluid progesterone and GRP activity were not significant. The correlation between follicular fluid 17 hydroxyprosesterone values and GRP activity for the untreated r .833, P .001 , as well as hMG r2 .853, p .0025 and clomiphene r2 .637, p .025 treated patients was significant by second order regression analysis. The correlation between GRP and androstenedione concentration from untreated r .241 , hMG r .357 , and clomiphene r .219 treated patients was not significant, nor was the correlation between testosterone and GRP activity significant r .477, .409, .480, respectively . The average inhibin activity for untreated patients was 50 1.9CU.In patients receiving treatment, inhibin activity was 8.2 2.3 and 35.4 3.7 CU for clomiphene and hMG treatment, respectively. Differences between hMG and either clomiphene or untreated patients were highly significant p.061 . Correlation between inhibin andGRP activities for untreated patients was significant r .654 p.05 Figure 26 . However, there was no statistically significant correlation between inhibin and GRP activities in patients receiving either hMG r .270 or clomiphene r .262 . These observations report the presence of an aromatase inhibitor GRP in a purified fraction of human follicular fluid. This follicular fluid protein fraction GRP has previously been shown to inhibit hMGmediated increases in rat ovarian weight and serum estradiol concentrations. As is shown hereinafter in Example Thirteen, when this protein fraction is injected into regularly menstruating monkeys, it disrupts folliculogenesis resulting in either anovulatory cycles or luteal phase insufficiencies accompanied by low serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations without markedly altered peripheral serum gonadotropin levels.This data, taken together with those presented previously, suggest that the developing granulosa cell, through production of an aromatase inhibitor, is capable of autoregulating the estrogen production of its own and other follicles. Example EightGonadal Regulatory Protein Inhibition of MicrosomalAromatase Activity In this example, the effect of the gonadalregulating protein on aromatase activity was studied in cell free placental microsome preparations which were prepared in accordance with the techniques described inMol. Cell. Endocrinol., 6 1976 pp.10 5 115 and J.Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., 39 1974 754 760. Aromatase incubations were carried out in a total volume of 0.6 ml in 12 x 75 ml glass tubes as described in the above identified references. Incubations contained 0.3 ml of placental cell free preparation in buffer A, 0.10 ml of 14C androstenedione A,10 6 molar , NADPH 10 6 molar and nicotinamide 0.4 molar in buffer A. Gonadal regulatory protein test fractions 0.2 ml , as described above, were preincubated with placental extracts 20 minutes and then the 14C androstenedione NADPH mixture was added. Reaction at termination quenching was performed by addition of 100 fold excess unlabeled A. Estrogen concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay as described in J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., 39, 754 760. GRP dose response determinations were performed using a three minute reaction time. The velocities determined over a range of substrate concentrations 0.5 2 mM demonstrated Michaelis Menton type kinetics with a Km of 0.8 mM as shown in Figure 27.The aromatase velocities were determined over a range of GRP concentrations 0, 62.5, 125, 250, 500 and 1,000 tug ml . The use of,Dixon kinetic plotting techniques demonstrated that GRP inhibited microsomal aromatase with an App Ki 3 x 10 5 M Figure 28 . These data demonstrate the non competitive inhibition of GRP on aromatase activity. Enzyme inhibition may be of three types. First, competitive inhibition describes the competition of the inhibitor for the substrate specific site on the enzyme. Second, non competitive inhibition describes a direct inhibition of the enzyme without competition forth substratespecific sites. Third, uncompetitive inhibition describes an indirect inhibition of the enzyme by additional mechanisms. In Figure 28, the intersection of the lines at the abscissa, as opposed to ordinal intersection competitive or nonintersection uncompetitive show that GRP is a noncompetitive inhibitor of aromatase activity. GRP directly interacts with the aromatase molecule to inhibit its activity.Example NineModulation of Beta ol Dehydrogenase 3pool Activity By Follicular Protein Porcine and human granulosa cells from medium sized follicles 2 5 mm in diameter were cultured 100,000 cells per culture with various concentrations of GRP isolated from follicular fluid. To these cultures pregnenolone 10 5 M and either hCG or pFSH was added. The conversion of pregnenolone to pregesterone was used to determine 3 beta ol dehydrogenase activity in the granulosa cells. GRP caused a biphasic response in progesterone production.Gonadal regulatory protein in the concentration of 167 ug ml caused a 10 fold increase in progesterone production, while the 500 ug ml concentration caused a return to baseline levels. These results are shown inFigures 29 and 30. Although pFSH induced a dose response increase in progesterone production, hCG produced no change in progesterone levels. Low doses of the gonadal regulatory protein acted synergistically with low doses of pFSH to increase 3 beta ol dehydrogenase activity. However, high doses of GRP inhibited the low dose pFSH stimulation of 3 beta ol dehydrogenase activity. High doses of pFSH 10 ug culture overcame both the low dose enhancement and the high dose inhibition of GRP on 3 beta ol dehydrogenase activity.Kinetic analysis of GRP modulation of 3 beta ol dehydrogenase activity was performed substantially as described in Example Eight. The effects ofGRP on 3 beta ol dehydrogenase activity in human placental microsomes are of a non competitive nature. Example TenGranulosa Cell Inhibition ofLH hCG Receptors by GRP GRP was isolated from porcine follicular fluid substantially as described in Example Three. Granulosa Cell Cultures The granulosa cells were counted using a hemocytometer and viability was determined by 1 trypan blue exclusion. Cells were cultured 2 x 105 in 2 ml of Medium 100 containing l08 fetal calf serum with penicillin and streptomycin 100 g ml and 100 U ml respectively in 12 x 75 mm Falcon plastic test tubes.FSH 10 ng , and or GRP 1 mg were added at the initiation of culture. Media was changed after seventytwo hours, Binding Analyses Porcine granulosa cells were suspended in appropriate volumes of PBS 0.l gelatin PBS gel . All assays were run with five concentrations of labeled hCG 10 ul , buffer 2BS 0.lG gel, 100 ul , and cells.Reactions were initiated by the addition of granulosa cells and were carried out for four hours at 25 C. All reaction tubes were precoated with 5 BSA to reduce non specific absorption. Reactions were terminated by adding one ml of cold PBS followed by centrifugation at 30,000 x g for ten minutes. The supernatant was carefully aspirated and the pellet rewashed with one ml of PBS. The final pellet was counted in a gamma counter. Specific binding was calculated as the difference between binding in the presence nonspecific and absence total of an excess of unlabeled hormone. Data were analyzed by Scatchard plots.Duplicate determinations were performed in three separate assays at each time interval. Follicular protein significantly reduced porcine granulosa cell hCG binding by seventy four hours of culture. This effect was prevented with the co administration of FSH. By ninety six hours of culture, no change in porcine granulosa cell hCG binding was apparent with MESH, follicular protein, or both compared to control cultures demonstrating cellular recovery after removal of follicular protein at seventy two hours of culture. Thus, in addition to regulating key enzymatic steps in the steriodogenic pathway aromatase, 34 ol dehydrogenase , general granulosa cell response to trophic LH stimulation is also mediated by follicular protein through inhibition of LH receptor function. Example ElevenAdenylate Cyclase Activity The effects of GRP on FSH induced adenylate cyclase activity in porcine granulosa cells was evaluated using Gpp NH p and forskolin as pharmacological probes of adenylate cyclase activity. With the addition of 100 ug ml of GRP, a significant decrease in this activity was found. Maximal inhibition of cAMP formation was achieved with 1 mg ml of GRP. Adenylate cyclase activity reached a maximum 20 min after incubation withFSH and returned to baseline by 45 minutes. GRP induced a parallel reduction in adenylate cyclase activity during this same interval of time Figure 31 .Adenylate cyclase activity in the membranes of GRP FSH and GRP alone treated cells was significantly less than in cells incubated with FSH p .05 . Adenylate cyclase activity of GRP treated cells was unchanged in the presence of methyl isobutal xanthine. Further, whenGRP was heated 56C, 45 min. or precipitated with 10 TCA, it lost the capability to inhibit adenylate cyclase. The 50 inhibitory dose ID50 for GRP inhibition of Gpp NH p stimulated adenylate cyclase activity with preincubation of granulosa cells with FSH was 350 ug ml and 8p ug ml without FSH. The ID50 for the GRP inhibition of forskolin stimulated adenylate cyclase astivity was 350 ug ml Figure 32 . Adenylate cyclase activity was determined after a 10 min. incubation with forskolin or Gpp NH p.When these responses were compared during a 5 20 min. interval, the Gpp NH p stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was more sensitive to inhibition by GRP than forskolin stimulated adenylate cyclase activity p .05 . Adenylate cyclase activity stimulated by Gpp NH p was also, on a molar basis, more sensitive to GRP inhibition than forskolin stimulated activity. GRP had no apparent effect on LH or hCG responsive adenylate cyclase activity in these granulosa cell preparations. No other naturally occurring substance has previously been shown to selectively inhibit FSH responsive adenylate cyclase activity in granulosa cells without also inhibiting LH responsive adenylate cyclase activity. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that GRP inhibited FSH responsive adenylate cyclase activity in porcine granulosa cells.Example TwelveReduction of Follicular Atresia Sheep were injected intramuscularly with GRP 2 mg at 08 00 and 16 00 hours for fourteen days.During this interval, there was a destruction of the estrous cycle such that they did not ovulate. On Day 14 of treatment the ovaries were removed, fixed in formal in, serially sectioned 4 microns and the sections were mounted on glass slides for microscopic evaluation after staining with hematoxylin and eosin. It was evident that GRP had inhibited ovulation by blocking the normal development process whereby a developing follicle either ovulates or degenerates by becoming atretic. This was evident in development of the follicles. These findings demonstrate that the normal life span of the total follicular pool could be significantly prolonged by the therapeutic administration of GRP. With prolongation of the life span of the follicular pool, a prolongation of the reproductive capacity of an individual would naturally follow.Since the alteration in function and composition of sex steroid dependent structures, which is commonly referred to as menopause in females, would be prevented or forestalled totally, or in part, if the sex steroid secretion was maintained, and since the ovarian follicles are the source of such sex steroids, it follows that prolongation of the life span of ovarian follicles by GRP therapy will lead to prevention or reduction of the clinical manifestations of the menopause. III. Whole Animal Studies Example Thirteen Inhibition of the Primate Ovarian Cycle by GRP The Examples heretofore presented report the identification of a heat and trypsin labile protein extracted from porcine, bovine and human gonadal fluid which inhibited ovarian response to gonadotropins. The activity of this protein, secreted by human granulosa cells, increased with increasing follicular fluid estradiol levels and decreased with increasing follicular fluid progesterone levels as shown in Example Four both in vivo and during granulosa cells luteinization in vitro Example Four . This material has also been found to inhibit granulosa cell aromatase activity in both porcine Example Three and human Example Four granulosa cells in vitro. Follicular fluid extracts containing this activity are shown in said Examples to have,a molecular weight of 12,000 18,000 and isoelectric points of pH 4. 0 to 4.5 and 6.0 to 6.5, showing that the biophysical nature of this protein is not inhibin. In the present Example, the effects of this follicular protein fraction on the integrated hypothalamic pituitary ovarian axis of the normally cycling monkey are assessed. Adult female rhesus monkeys Macaca mulatto n 8 were selected because of reproductive characteristics indicating normal ovarian function and menstrual regularity. The GRP employed in thisExample was the inhibitory follicular fluid Protein fraction which was obtained as described in Example Three. Five monkeys were treated with GRP extracted from porcine follicular fluid and three monkeys served as vehicle controls. The GRP 3 mg in 1 ml of .0l M PBS, pH 7 was administered IM at 07 00 hours and 19 00 hours beginning on day 1 of the menstrual cycle for a total of twentynine injections. Total dose for each monkey was 87 mg.Control monkeys received only PBS over the same interval. Iron supplement was administered once each week. Daily 09 00 11 00 hours , femoral blood samples 3.5 ml were collected beginning with the onset of menses day 1 and were continued until the onset of next menses. Radioimmunoassays for LH, FSH, 17P estradiol, and progesterone in serum were performed. Monkeys which received GRP injections had either no serum LH peak nor elevation of serum progesterone n 2, Figure 33 , or a midcycle LH surge followed by an inadequate luteal phase as demonstrated by low serum progesterone levels and or early onset twenty four days intermenstrual interval of vaginal bleeding n 2, Figure 34 . One GRP treated monkey had a midcycle LH surge followed by depressed follicular phase estradiol and luteal phase serum progesterone levels not shown . The 95 confidence limits for the vehicle control and other values obtained for this population are depicted by the shaded area in Figures 33 and 34. Serum estradiol levels were reduced throughout the interval of GRP treatment in the monkeys without LH surges in the late follicular phase Figure 34 and in those with luteal phase defects Figure 33 .Serum FSH and LH levels were within the 95 confidence intervals forGRP treated monkeys Figure 33 . However, in all five GRP treated monkeys, serum FSH levels rose during the course of therapy. In the monkeys with inadequate luteal phases Figure 33 , serum estradiol levels were below the 95 confidence intervals in the late follicular and mid luteal phases.While the serum levels of both estradiol and progesterone were markedly suppressed after the LH surge In subsequent cycles N 3 monkey onset of vaginal bleeding occurred in the usual twenty six thirty day monthly interval and no toxic effect of GRP treatments was noted. GRP administered to normally cycling monkeys throughout the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle reduced peripheral estradiol levels without markedly affecting FSH, resulting in either apparent anovulation or inadequate luteal phases. The mixed response in serum sex steroid levels in the GRP treated monkeys may reflect a variable ovarian sensitivity to GRP. That serum FSH levels were not significantly inhibited indicates that this material has a biological activity different from that of charcoal extracted whole porcine follicular fluid.Further, when GRP was tested in an inhibin assay, its activity was either at the limits of sensitivity or undetectable.Charcoal extracted whole porcine follicular fluid containing inhibin disrupts the normal process of follicular maturation through selective inhibition ofFSH secretion. In contrast, in the present Example, normal or rising serum FSH levels during GRP treatment were found. This indicates that the purification of follicular fluid described herein removed the major inhibin activity. The molecular weight of the described GRP is less than 20,000 while inhibin activity has been associated with molecular weights greater than 45,000. The in vivo observations of reduced serum estradiol levels in GRP treated monkeys support the previously described Examples of granulosa cell aromatase inhibition by both human and porcine derived GRP. Further, these observations are in agreement with examples of reduced serum estradiol levels in GRP treated rats. Luteal phase defects, as evidenced by suppressed serum estradiol and progesterone levels and early onset of vaginal bleeding, result from inadequate follicular maturation in the preceding follicular phase. Taken together with the observations reported in this Example of reduced serum estradiol and progesterone levels associated with GRP treatment,these data indicate that the GRP described in the present invention has a direct intraovarian action which disrupts the normal process of folliculogenesis by an action apart from gonadotropin stimulation.Example FourteenInhibition of Spermatogenesis. Male mongrel dogs were injected with 2 mg ofGRP derived from porcine follicular fluid, as described in Example Three, at 08 00 and 16 00 hours for 20 days.On Day 20 of therapy the testis were obtained, fixed in formalin, sectioned by microtome four micron sections , mounted on slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Upon evaluation of the slides, a marked reduction in mature spermatozoa was present in the seminiferous tubules in the GRP treated dogs as compared to the controls. Moreover, there was an 87 reduction in pacytene spermatocytes and a 44 reduction in mature spermatogonia in the GRP treated dogs. The effect of GRP on spermatogenesis was further studied by injecting male dogs IM, gluteal with a PBS vehicle, either alone or with 5 mg of ovarian GRP, daily for seventeen days. Following this treatment, the seminiferous epithelium was evaluated by light microscopy and divided into eight stages, based on the criteria set forth by Foote et al. inSpermatogenesis in the Dog, Anatomical Record, 173 341348 1972 . As opposed to the control data, which showed normal spermatogenesis, the GRP treated group showed a significant inhibition of transformation from type A to type B spermatogonia during the final stages of spermatogenesis. Since the generative cycle in dogs extends for sixteen days, any remaining type B spermatogonia mature spermatozoa in the abovedescribed study are solely attributable to transformation prior to treatment, and repeated administration of GRP to male mammals will completely inhibit the production of mature spermatozoa. IV. Preparation of GRP AntibodiesExample FifteenPreparation of GRP Antibodies Antibodies monoclonal and polyclonal to GRP and its conjuners and analogs may be prepared for diagnostic and therapeutic uses including but not limited to fertility control. Antibody in this contex refers to a synthetic protein which binds GRP and alters GRP biological activity. Antibodies to GRP are prepared by either polyclonal or monoclonal techniques Polyclonal 5 adult rabbits are immunized with .1 mg of GRP suspended in complete Freund s adjuvant 5 ml . One ml of this preparation is injected subcutaneously at 20 different sites in the back and neck. This is followed by monthly injections thereafter.Ear vein phlebotomies are performed after each monthly booster injection and the sera obtained are checked for titer, affinity, and specificity. In a specific example, 1 vg of GRP was solubilized in 0.5 ml physiological saline and emulsified with an equal volume of Freund s adjuvant to prepare an inoculum. New Zealand White, female rabbits weighing 2 1 2 3 kg were bled via the median ear artery for pre immune serum. A 10 x 20 cm area on the back was shaved, then each rabbit was intradermally injected at multiple points. Approximately 50 75 vl of inoculum was injected into 10 25 sites in the shaved area rabbits 1 and 3 received 0.6 ml and 1.6 ml, respectively.The rabbits were boosted in similar fashion six weeks later receiving 0.5 ml and 1.5 ml, respectively. Six and ten day post boost, the rabbits were test bled, again through the median artery. Sera containing the polyclonal antibodies thus obtained were titred via RIA against 125I labelled GRP as follows. Rabbit sera were two fold serially diluted inRIA buffer from 1 1000 to 1 64,000. 100al each of theRIA buffer, diluted serum, and 125I GRP and 200 us RIA buffer were also prepared. The tubes were incubated at room temperature RT overnight. One half ml 0.5 ml precipitating solution containing 28 goat antirabbit gamma globulin and 4 polyethylene glycol in RIA buffer was then added to each tube except the total tubes. The tubes were vortexed, incubated at room temperature for ten minutes, then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for an additional ten minutes. The supernatant was aspirated and the precipitin pellet counted for one minute on a gamma counter. The rabbit sera was found to contain antibody which bound 125I GRP in all dilutions tested, including 1 64,000. Monoclonal BALB c mice are immunized withGRP by intraperitoneal injection 250 ug x 2.Thereafter, the spleens are collected and cell suspensions prepared by perfusion with DMEM. The BALB c spleen cells are fused with SP 2 0 Ag 14 mouse myeloma cells by PEG and the resultant hybridomas grown in HAT selective tissue culture media 20 fetal calf serum.The surviving cells are allowed to grow to confluence.The spent culture media is checked for antibody titer, specificity, and affinity. Specifically, the mice were immunized with GRP adjuvant emulsion described above. Each mouse first received 0.2 ml of this emulsion intraperitoneally, then were reinjected in similar fashion with 0.1 ml six weeks later. Mouse serum was obtained ten days after the second injection and then tested for anti GRP activity via ELISA. The mouse exhibiting the highest absolute anti GRP activity was chosen for cell fusion. Three to four days prior to fusion, the chosen mouse was intravenously injected with 0.1 ml GRP solubilized in physiological saline, and SP2 0 Ag14BALB c myeloma cells maintained in log phase culture.On the day of fusion, the mouse was sacrificed and its spleen aseptically removed. Spleen cell suspension containing B lymphocytes and macrophages were prepared by prefusion of the spleen. The cell suspension was washed and collected by centrifugation. Myeloma cells were also washed in this manner. Live cells were counted and the cells were placed in a 370C water bath and 1 ml of 50 poly ethylene glycol in DMEM slowly added The cells were incubated in the PEG for one to one and a half minutes at 37 C, after which the PEG was diluted by the slow addition of media. The cells were pelletted and 35 to 40 ml of DMEM containing 10 fetal bovine serum was added. The cells were then dispensed into tissue culture plates and incubated overnight in a 37 C, 5 CO2, humidified incubator. The next day, DMEM FCS containing hypoxanthine, thymidine, and aminopterin HAT medium was added to each well. The concentration of HAT in the medium to be added was twice the final concentrations required i.e. Hfinal 1 x 10 4M, Afinal 4.0 x 10 7M, and Tfinal 1.6 x 10 5M. Subsequently, the plates were incubated with 1 x HAT medium every three four days for two weeks. Fused cells were thereafter grown in DMEM FCS containing hypoxanthine and thymidine. As cell growth became 1 2 to 3 4 confluent on the bottom of the wells, supernatant tissue culture fluid was taken and tested for GRP specific antibody by ELISA. Positive wells were cloned by limiting dilution over macrophage or thymocyte feeder plates, and cultured in DMEM FCS.Cloned wells were tested and recloned three times before a statistically significant monoclonal antibody was obtained. Spent culture media from the chosen clone contained antibody which bound 1251 GRP in all dilutions tested, including 1 64,000. Each of the above described antibody containing solutions was tested against GRP secreted by granulosa cells and found to bind to independently produced GRP.Antibodies from both polyclonal and monoclonal pre separations are screened for affinity by evaluating the ability to inhibit the reduction of aromatase activity by GRP in human placental microsomes. Those antibodies which block this reaction were titered by incubating various dilutions of the antibody with a fixed mass of radioactively labelled GRP in 100 ul of assay buffer TRIS .025 M, pH 7.4 at 40C overnight with constant agitation. The dilution of antibody that bound 50 of the labelled GRP under these conditions was defined as the titer. Specificity was determined in the same manner as the above only column fractions not containingGRP activity were radiolabelled and screened for antibody binding. It will be apparent from the above description of GRP antibodies that a wide variety of diagnostic tests is possible using the antibodies of the invention.The over production of GRP by the gonads, an indication of the presence of a condition such as ovarian cancer, could easily be detected in body fluids such as serum through the use of an immunoassay which employs the novel antibodies according to methods known in the art.Similarly, in attempting to diagnose causes of infertility, an immunoassay to detect decreased levels of GRP in the body would be a useful adjunct to known hormone assays. Further uses for the antibodies include the induction of superovulation in livestock. The direct administration of GRP antibodies to sheep has been shown to induce multiple ovulations in ewes. It should be noted that other than the novelty of the protein and the preparation of GRP antibodies thereto, techniques required for the preparation and use of diagnostic test kits and superovulatory antibodies are known in the art and will not be described in further detail. The invention in general in certain aspects in particular are broad in scope, for example, the proteinaceous substance of the invention may be produced by other methods. In particular, a c DNA probe can be prepared against the biologically active portion of GRP, and used to identify the GRP genome in granulosa cells orSertoli cells from any mammalian species. The identified genome can then be synthesized into a plasmid which can then be employed to produce recombinant DNA in proliferating bacteria according to methods known in the art. In addition, granulosa or Sertoli cells may be transformed, e.g. by SV40 virus, to produce GRP in quantity. In summary, the intergonadal protein, its identifying characteristics, methods of production and uses set forth herein identify a novel and unique proteinaceous substance. GRP is described herein to be the only proteinaceous substance known which inhibits aromatase activity by determination of the extent of the conversion of androgens to estrogens.Moreover, such inhibition is unique in that it is non competitive in placental microsomes. Further, GRP produces a biphasic effect on 3 ol dehydrogenase activity in cultured granulosa cells as shown inFigures 29 and 30. In addition, GRP inhibits FSH induction ofLH receptor formation as determined by addition to an in vitro culture of granulosa cells, and inhibits FSH responsive adenylate cyclase activity as similarly determined, In addition to this biological activity, GRP is identified by the elution profile through a molecular weight exclusion column under the conditions set forth in Example Two, as indicated by the designation GRP of the elution curve in Figure 9. The elution profile through a hydrogen ion exclusion column, particularly the area designated by the indicated peaks numbers 4 and 7 in Figure lS, further identifies identifying characteristics of GRP when conducted under the conditions set forth in the Example Three.Moreover, a polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic pattern from a high pressure liquid chromatographic column, as shown by the designation GRP in column 6 of Figure 11, uniquely identifies GRP when the pattern is obtained as set forth in Example Two. From the foregoing description, one skilled in the art can easily ascertain the essential characteristics of the invention and, without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, can adapt the invention to various usages and conditions. Changes in form and the substitution of equivalents are contemplated as circumstances may suggest or render expedient and although specific terms have been employed herein, they are intended in a descriptive sense and not for purposes of limitation, the scope of the invention being delineated in the following claims.
