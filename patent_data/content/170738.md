## Abstract
A bracelet shaped filter device 10 moulded of plastics has a frame 16 surrounding a slotted filter portion 18 and integral retaining portions 26, 28 which permit it to be held tightly in contact wiht the surface of a pipe 12 . The filter portion 18 contains a plurality of evenly spaced slots 22 which are positioned so as to be spaced at a predetermined distance from an aperture 14 in the pipe 12 through which fluid may pass. The filter slots 22 are V shaped and of increasing width in a direction toward the centre of the pipe 12 . In a preferred embodiment, the retaining portions are integral straps which can be tightened and held by an inte gral fastening means 26 , 28 . In a modified structure Fig ures 5, 6 which is suitable for small pipes, the device may include curved portions which are adapted to be spread apart and snapped over the sides of the tube. The devices are especially useful to prevent entry of the solid particles in a fluidized bed into the fluid supply conduit.
