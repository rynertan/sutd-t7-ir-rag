## Description
RECOVERY OF VANADIUM AND COPPER FROM ADIPIC ACID PRODUCTION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONA. Field of the Invention The production of adipic acid by the liquid phase nitric acid oxidation of cyclohexanol and or cyclohexanone in the presence of a vanadium catalyst usually results in a purge waste stream containing valuable vanadium ions. The purge waste stream is generally derived from the mother liquor of one or more crystallizations involved in the recovery of the adipic acid and the necessity for purging arises because of the build up of other dibasic acids such as succinic acid and glutaric acid. In view of the value of such catalyst metals, recovery of both from the purge waste stream is necessary, if the process is to operate economically.B. The Prior Art The process for the nitric acid oxidation of cyclohexanol and or cyclohexanone in the presence of copper and vanadium catalysts is well known. The feed mixture utilized in most industrial processes is a mixture of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol derived from the air oxidation of cyclohexane although some processes utilize only cyclohexanol or only cyclohexanone as a feed to the nitric acid oxidation. The cyclohexanol and or cyclohexanone is generally mixed with from 5 to 40 times its weight of an aqueous nitric acid solution, the nitric acid solution being generally of a concentration of 35 to 65S by weight and there is also added the petal catalyst. Usually copper and vanadium are added as V205 or ammonium metavanadate and copper turnings.The total mount of catalyst is usually about 0.05 to 1.0 by weight of the reaction iixture. The liquid phase nitric acid oxidation is generally conducted at temperatures within the range of about 55 to 100 C, and pressures within the range of about 1 to 5 atmospheres absolute. There is produced in the nitric acid oxidation a liquid reaction product comprising the adipic acid as well as succinic acid, glutaric acid, nitric acid, water and the copper and vanadium catalyst values. There is also produced in the nitric acid oxidation an off gas containing nitrogen oxides such as NO, N20, NO2 and N 204 as well as other gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Adipic acid crystals are recovered from the liquid reaction product by crystallization techniques, resulting in a mother liquor which coaprises an aqueous nitric acid solution containing copper and vanadium values as well as dibasic carboxylic acids aainly glutaric and succinic acids although some unrecovered adipic acid may also be present .A portion of this mother liquor iay be, and generally is, recycled to the nitric acid oxidation reactor although a portion must be removed or purged to prevent buildup of the succinic and glutaric acid impurities, the portion removed or purged being the above ventioned purge waste stream. The recovery of the adipic acid by crystallization is well known and such may be accomplished by one or more crystallization stages and nay include effecting a removal of some nitric acid and water and re dilution between crystallization steps. Various methods have been developed for recovery of the copper and vanadium values from these purge waste streams as may be seen from U.S. Patent Nows. 3,106,450 3,186,952 3,463,740 and 3,554,592. Also see British Patent Specifications 980762 and 936403. The sost popular of the methods for the recovery of the cat alyst metals from the purge waste streams is by passing these streams through an ion exchange treatment sone thereby the petals are bound to a resin exchanger and then the petal is recovered by passing nitric acid over the exchanger.The stream resulting from the regenera tion of the exchanger consists essentially of a nitric acid solution with the catalyst etals therein and, therefore, can be recycled to the nitric acid oxidation zone. Vhile such a recovery process, as well as the various known modifications thereof, are fairly efficient in recovering the copper values from the purge waste streams, they do not provide as efficient recovery of the vanadium values as desired. It has been proposed in U.S. 3,965,164 to remove H1103 and water from the adipic mother liquor and then treat the liquor with the adipic byproduct off gas containing nitrogen oxides, thereby improving recovery of vanadium values. Removal of HN03 and rater, however, has proven difficult and expensive. Any treatment method for improving ion exchange recovery of vanadium which would not require removal of HNO and or water would be a meritorious advance in the 3 art and is an object of this invention. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention is an improvement in a process for the production of adipic acid wherein a cyclohexanol and or cyclohexanone are oxidized by nitric acid oxidation at temperatures within the range of 550 to 100bC utilizing a vanadium catalyst to obtain a liquid reaction product comprising adipic acid and also produce a by product off gas containing nitrogen oxides and wherein b said reaction product is subjected to crystallization to isolate therefrom an adipic acid product and a mother liquor comprising an aqueous nitric acid solution containing therein dibasic carboxylic acids and vanadium values which improvement comprises treating at least a portion of the pother liquor to recover vanadium values ther.froi by c introducing S02 into the adipic mother liquor feed ALP ion exchange feed so as to improve recovery of vanadium values and, thereafter, d recovering vanadium values from the vanadyl containing mother liquor by passing it through a bed of cation exchange resin so as to accumulate vanadium ions thereon. If copper is also included as a catalyst it nay also be recovered by the same cation exchange. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE IlIVENTIOz The make up of the ion exchange feed is well known in the art and will depend on crystallization and evaporation procedures. A typical ion exchange feed contains 1X to 2.5 nitric acid, 20 to 27 alkyl dicarboxylic acids e.g., 14 glutaric, 6 succinic, 4 adipic 8000 11,000 ppm copper and 600 2500 ppm vanadium V205 and the rest is water. Vanadium is introduced in the form of an oxide such as V205, an acid such as vanadic acid, a salt such as NH4VO3, or in metallic form. If used, copper may be introduced in metallic form. Residual NOx in the feed is preferably removed or converted to nitric acid by air sparging into the feed tank before introducing S02. While the precise mechanism by which the S02 increases vanadium recovery is not to be considered a part of or a limitation upon this invention, it is theorized that the S02 reduces pervanadyl ions to vanadyl ions which have a greater affinity for the ion exchange resin. Any method of introducing S02 into the mother liquor is within the scope of this invention. The apparatus used for contacting a liquid and a gas stream continuously may be a tower filled with irregular solid packing material, an empty tower into which the liquid is sprayed, or a tower containing a number of bubble cap or sieve plates. Ordinarily, the gas and liquid streams flow countercurrently through the equipment in order to obtain the greatest rate of absorption. The gas absorption operation may also be carried out in one or more spray columns, wetted wall columns, stirred vessels, or other mechanically aided devices, as well as by simply bubbling the S02 gas through a container of the liquor. An open or closed system ey be employed but a closed system is preferred. In situ introduction may be achieved by adding chemicals such as metal sulfites or bisulfites to the adipic mother liquor which in turn generate SO2 by internal reaction. Whatever the mesns of introduction, the resulting mole ratio of dissolved SO2 to vanadium ion in the ion exchange feed should be about 1 5, preferably 1 3.Below about 1 mole, the effect will be diminished.Above about 5 moles there will be diminishing improvement. The presence of other oxidizing agents such asNOx or ferric ions will lessen diminishing improvement at lower levels. If only a portion of the ion exchange feed is employed to introduce the S02, it must, of course, be well mixed with the remainder of the feed. For example, it may be convenient to saturate a stream then mix the saturated stream with the remainder of the feed in a mixing tank. At a temperature of 60 C, for example, a good mix can be obtained in 10 minutes to 1 hour, either in a closed or open vessel. As indicated above, the last step of the pro cess of this invention is to ion exchange the solution resulting from mixing sulfurous solution with the ion exchange feed. Any of the hydrogen form cation exchange resins disclosed in the prior art for recovering metals such as copper and vanadium can be employed. Resins which can be used in alternating cycles of metal absorption followed by mineral acid elution as taught in the prior art can also be employed in the present process. n Jtmberlite IB 200 manufactured by Rohm and Hass Company has been used successfully. Many other similar resins, such as Dovex 50WX8 , Dowex 50X16 and Dow SA 1101.1 , all manufactured by Dow Chemical Company, can also be used.
