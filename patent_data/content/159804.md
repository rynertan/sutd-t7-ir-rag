## Description
DESCRIPTION TITLE WALL TIE DEVICE The present invention relates to a wall tie device comprising a wall bracket and connecting tie for the purpose of tying a brick or block structure to an existing structure. In the past, the construction of a partitioning wall or new external wall necessitated interleaving of the new bricks with the old to establish a solid structure.However, this was a time consuming and skilled operation where old bricks had to be gouged out so that the new bricks could be interleaved between them. To simplify this process, interengaging brackets and ties have been proposed which firmly tie the new structure to the existing one without the use of interleaving brickwork. The present invention relates to improved forms of tie device comprising a wall bracket and tie and to a wall bracket for such a device. According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a tie device for tying a brick or block structure to an existing structure comprising a bracket having a back plate with means for securing it to the existing structure, and at least one tie to be interposed between courses of new bricks or blocks and having a pair of limbs, the back plate of the bracket having at least one socket in which the tie is engageable by pushing the tie perpendicularly or approximately perpendicularly towards the back plate of the bracket to link the tie with the bracket, the tie, once engaged in said socket being slidable lengthwise of the bracket, the or each socket being constituted by at least one aperture in the back plate. This aspect of the invention further provides a bracket for use with a wall tie having a pair of resilient limbs, for tying a brack or block structure to an existing structure, the bracket having a back plate with means for securing the bracket to the existing structure and the back plate having at least one socket for receiving the free ends of the resilient limbs of the tie, the or each socket being constituted by at least one aperture in the backplate and being adapted to receive the limbs of the tie when the tie is pushed perpendicularly or approximately perpendicularly towards the backplate to link the tie with the bracket. According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a tie device for tying a brick or block structure to an existing structure comprising a bracket having a back plate with means for securing it to the existing structure, and at least one tie to be interposed between courses of new bricks or blocks and having a pair of limbs, the back plate of the bracket having at least one socket in which the tie is engageable to link the tie with the bracket, the tie, once engaged in said socket being slidable in at least one direction lengthwise of the bracket, so as to provide vertical adjustability of the tie relative to the bracket, while remaining engaged with the bracket, the or each socket being constituted by at least one aperture in the back plate. This aspect of the invention also provides a bracket for use with a wall tie having a pair of resilient limbs, for trying a brick or block structure to an existing structure, the bracket having a back plate with means for securing the bracket to the existing structure and the back plate having at least one socket for receiving and engaging the tie, the or each socket being constituted by at least one aperture in the back plate and being adapted to engage the tie in a manner enabling vertical sliding adjustment of the position of the tie relative to the bracket. Both aspects of the invention can thus avoid the problem of having to manufacture a range of brick size dependent brackets by permitting the tie to slide lengthwise of the bracket to accommodate different brick sizes. Further, with the first aspect of the invention, since the tie can be engaged with the bracket by pushing it perpendicularly towards the backplate of the bracket, there is no need for either end of the bracket to be accessible as in certain prior tie devices in order to be able to insert the tie. Preferably, in either aspect, the range of adjustability is at least lem, more preferably at least 2cm. plate for receiving the free end of the tie limb and a portion extending longitudinally of the back plate for allowing the tie to slide longitudinally of the back plate.In one construction each socket may comprise a pair of apertures symmetrically disposed about the longitudinal centre line of the back plate. Alternatively each socket may comprise an aperture having portions adapted to enable both free ends of the tie to be inserted therein. These two sorts of socket could if desired to be used in the same embodiment. Suitably each socket is generally symmetrical about the longitudinal axis of the back plate. The Deans for securing the bracket to the wall may comprise a row of securing means along the back plate of the bracket and the sockets are preferably arranged to permit vertical adjustability of the ties in the space between respective adjacent securing means. Thsecuring means may be a series of fixing holes disposed along a line extending lengthwise of the bracket. Preferably the apertures of each pair of apertures are disposed to opposite sides of this row of fixing holes. Also the or each aperture may have side edges shaped to provide one or more longitudinally spaced detent positions at which the tie will be restrained from further sliding movement. By making the various features of the brackets symmetrically about the longitudinal centre of the bracket, the bracket does not require to be installed one particular way up. The invention will be further described by way of non limitative example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1A shows a portion a bracket for use in an embodiment of the present invention Figure 1B shows a portion of the bracket ofFigure 1A viewed from the side Figure 2 shows one form of tie for use with the bracket of Figures 1A and B and Figure 3 shows an embodiment of the tie device in use. The bracket of which one end portion is shown inFigures 1A, 1B is stamped and folded out of sheet metal and comprises a back plate 1 having a surface 2 which faces the new brickwork and a reverse surface 3 which faces the existing structure. The bracket may be suitably coated, or be of a suitable material, to be highly resistant to corrosion. The bracket is provided with two side flanges 4 formed by folding the material or the bracket at right angles to the back plate 1, these flanges being provided with a row of keying holes 5 for mortar, plaster or rendering. Disposed along the longitudinal centre line of the back plate is a series of fixing holes 6 of rounded oblong or oval shape to provide a degree of lateral adjustability of the bracket when fixed to the wall and disposed to each side of this row of holes are a row of sockets each formed of a pair of apertures 7 which are arranged to opposite sides of the centre line of the back plate. Each aperture 7 is in the form of a WL and comprises an elongate centre portion 8 and, at each end of this centre portion, a recess 9 which allows the entry of feet 22 of a tie 20 to be described below .As shown the recesses 9 extend outwardly from the centre portion 8 but they need not in other constructions. The bracket is provided with a number of feet1 10 which are provided to maintain the back plate 1 in parallel spaced relation to the existing wall so as to provide space for the wfeetZ 12 of the tie and so that the rear surface 3 is stood off from the surface of the existing wall. This provides a space into which mortar from between the new courses of bricks can enter via a number of keying holes 11 in the back plate 1 and thus help bond the new wall to the existing one provided there is no excessive relative vertical movement of the two walls . The holes 11 are located vertically between the two recesses 9, of a cut out 7 since it is at this level that the mortar between courses of the new wall will be located. Only the end portion of the bracket is shown inFigures IA and lB As can be seen in Figure 1B, the side flanges 4 stop short of the end of the bracket and have a rounded corner, at 10. The other end of the bracket can be of corresponding layout, with the centre part comprising as many repeats as are necessary to achieve the desired length, of the section A B in Figure 1A. Referring now to Figure 2, the tie 20 is shown to be generally of U shaped and is made of metal wire or rod material and has two side by side resilient limbs 21 having which initially converge, moving away from the web of the U and then, about halfway along diverge. At their free ends they have outwardly directed feet 22. They might equally well be inturned with the recesses 9 being similarly inturned to correspond . When a new wall is to be built and tied to an existing structure, the one or more brackets such as one inFigure 1 are fixed to the old wall along the vertical line from which the new wall will extend. There may be a continuous or intermittent arrangement of these brackets along this line. Alternatively one continuous bracket may be used. The bracket may be fixed to the existing structure by any suitable means such as nails, screws or bolts so as to fix the bracket 1 firmly to the wall. Every so often a tie must be fixed to the bracket and be placed on top of the top course of bricks so far laid so that in the laying of the next course of bricks the tie is firmly interposed between them and strongly holds these new bricks to the bracket. This is done by squeezing the legs 21 of the tie together and inserting them in the upper recesses 9 by pushing the tie perpendicularly, or at least approximately perpendicularly to the back plate 1. Once the feet 22 of the tie are inserted in the apertures 7, the legs of the tie can be released so that they spring outwards so as to engage with the laterally outer edges of the apertures and the tie can then be slid downwardly until it rests on the uppermost course of bricks. This lengthwise sliding of the tie, of course, makes it possible to place it at whichever position is necessary to interpose it between two courses of new bricks. As one alternative, each socket into which the feet 22 of a tie 20 is slotted can be formed of a single aperture in the shape of an I with the upright of the I located along the centreline for the back plate the upper and lower transverse limbs allow sufficient space for outwardly directed tie feet to be inserted. Further squeezing of the tie limbs close together will allow the tie to slide along the length of the longitudinal limb to the requried position.
