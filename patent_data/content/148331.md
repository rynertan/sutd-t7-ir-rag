# Output gear of automatic transmission.

## Abstract
A hub 11 of an output gear 17 is connected detach ably to a rear end of a main power train for an automatic transmission of a front engine rear wheel drive vehicle by means of splines, so that the main power train can be used as a power train of an automatic transmission for a front engine front wheel drive vehicle. The hub of the output gear has an annular groove 18 for receiving a lubricating oil. The annular groove is enlarged in both width and depth so that most of the oil in the annular groove does not rotate together with the output gear and does not hamper the lubricating oil supply through the annular groove.
