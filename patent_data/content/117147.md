# Process for production of olefin oxides and ketones.

## Abstract
A process for converting a desired olefin to the corres ponding olefin oxide, such as propylene oxide, and or ketone comprising reacting a mixture of the olefin, thallic oxide, carbon dioxide and water in a substantially organic solvent free reaction zone withdrawing a product stream from the reaction zone, the stream comprising the olefin and ketone product separating and collecting the olefin oxide and ketone product from the stream contacting the reduced thallous values present in the mixture with molecular oxygen and an effective catalyst to back oxidise the thallous values to their original thallic form separating and recycling back to the reaction mixture the regenerated thallic values.
