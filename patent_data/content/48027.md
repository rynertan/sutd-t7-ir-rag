# Turbo compound internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
First and second waste gates respectively control the supercharing pressure of an engine supercharger and the pressure fed to an auxiliary turbine from the engine turbo charger turbine. The scroll of the auxiliary turbine is divided by a partition into first and second passages which respec tively receive the exhaust gases bypassed by the first waste gate and the exhaust gases from the turbo charger turbine. The first waste gate prevents over pressurization of the engine cylinders while the second prevents the build up of excessive back pressure downstream of the turbo charger turbine, thus maintaining the efficiency and torque output of the engine while still deriving benefit from the operation of the auxiliary turbine.
