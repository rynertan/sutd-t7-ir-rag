## Description
This invention relates to a magnetron of the type including a central cathode supported by rods mounted on a ceramic stem. Such a magnetron is known from JP A 56 132747 Fig 18 . In the cathode support structure of the conventional magnetron for use in microwave ovens, as illustrated in Fig. 17, the two ends of the filament cathode 21 which is coiled are fixed to a pair of end caps 22, 23, either directly or via a guide 24. A pair of cathode support rods 25, 26, made of molybdenum, are fixed to the two end caps 22, 23. These cathode support rods 25, 26 pass to the outside via through holes 28 which run right through the ceramic stem 27, and are bonded hermetically to terminal strips 29, which are brazed hermetically at the outer ends. 30 indicates the brazed connections. A metal sleeve 31, which forms part of the evacuated envelope, is sealed hermetically at a brazed joint 32 to the top of the ceramic stem. In this kind of conventional structure, the molybdenum cathode support rods have to be fairly long, as they are sealed hermetically at the bottom end of the stem and extend outside it. This makes these parts expensive, and in addition it is not easy to obtain by this means sufficiently rigid support for the cathode. Further, it is difficult to achieve a hermetic seal between molybdenum and Kovar trade name Fe Ni Co alloy and since the hermetic joint is subjected to high temperatures because of heat conducted from the cathode, it is difficult to ensure a high degree of reliability for this seal. A different structure, that shown in Fig. 18, has been proposed in, for example, disclosed Japanese Patent Application Laid open No.JP A 56 132747. In this structure, hermetic sealing of the ceramic stem 27 and the cathode support rods 25, 26 is obtained by hermetic brazing using sealing rings 33 on the cathode side, i.e., on the side facing the evacuated region, of the stem. In this case, the provision of a step between the brazed joint 32 of the stem and the metal sleeve and the brazed joint 30 of the stem and the cathode support rods enhances withstand voltage performance between the two. But this structure too has disadvantages here again the molybdenum cathode support rods have to be long, so that the cost of these parts remains high, and overheating of the brazed joints of the cathode support rods is still likely to impair the seal. There is the additional disadvantage in both types of structure that since the hermetic brazed connections of the ceramic stem to the cathode support rods and to the metal sleeve are displaced relative to each other in the axial direction of the tube, the process of forming the metallized layer for these brazed joints is complicated. It is one object of the invention to provide a magnetron in which the cathode support rods are as short as possible, and a high degree of reliability can be obtained for the hermetic seals with the ceramic stem. The invention comprises a magnetron having the features of claim 1 for use in microwave ovens, wherein sealing metal plates are sealed hermetically to the cathode side of the ceramic stem, i.e., to that side which faces the evacuated region, outer connecting leads are inserted through holes formed in the stem, these leads being connected electrically to the sealing metal plates, cathode support rods are fixed to part of a sealing metal plate in each case, and the cathode support rods and outer connecting leads are thereby connected electrically via the sealing metal plates. With this structure, it is sufficient for the cathode support rods to be of a length corresponding approximately to the distance from the position of the cathode to the inner face, i.e., the cathode side, of the ceramic stem, and the cost of these parts is thereby reduced. Further, since heat conducted from the cathode does not pass directly to the outer connecting leads, overheating of the hermetic seals between the ceramic stem and the sealing metal plates is minimized, and the reliability of these seal is thus increased. Moreover, since the hermetic seals between the ceramic stem and the sealing metal plates and between the ceramic stem and the metal sleeve are positioned substantially on the same plane, the metallized layer required for all these seals can be formed in a single process, which simplifies the assembly procedure.

An explanation follows of the embodiment, referring to the drawings. The corresponding parts are designated by the same numbers throughout. The embodiment as shown in Figs. 1 8 has the structure described below. The numbers used in Fig. 1 refer to the following parts. The filament cathode 21 which is coiled comprises the two ends of which are fixed to a pair of end caps 22, 23 on the axis of an anode 36. A pair of cathode support rods 25, 26, made of molybdenum, are fixed to the two end caps 22, 23. These cathode support rods 25, 26 are supported with a ceramic stem 48. The anode structure 35 has cylindrical anode 36 which forms part of the tube envelope, and is provided on its inside wall with radially disposed vanes 37 which divide the interior of the cylinder into a plurality of resonators. The vanes 37 are all interconnected by a circular strap ring 38. A pair of pole pieces 39, 40 concentrating the magnetic field into the electron flow region are brazed to the two end faces of the cylindrical anode 36. An output side metal sleeve 41 which forms part of the outer envelope of the tube is mounted on the output side pole piece 39 on the top of this metal sleeve 41 are mounted an output part ceramic cylinder 42, a sealing ring 43 forming part of a high frequency choke, and a metal exhaust tube 44, also forming part of the high frequency choke. An output antenna lead 45 extends between one of vanes 37 and metal exhaust tube 44, to extract the microwave power produced by the resonators outside the tube. Part 46 is an output cap. On the cathode support side of the anode structure, a cylindrical metal sleeve 47 extends from ceramic stem side pole piece 40. This cylindrical sleeve 47 forms part of the evacuated envelope, and therefore one end face is hermetically sealed to pole piece 40, while the other end face is hermetically sealed to ceramic stem 48. A recess 49 is formed in the bottom of ceramic stem 48, and a pair of outer connecting leads 50, 51 project from this recess 49. A pair of ferrite permanent magnets 52, 53 are incorporated, with the above mentioned pole pieces between them, into the main body of the magnetron having this structure open frame yokes 54, 55 of ferromagnetic material are disposed outside these magnets. A perforated metal gasket is fixed between output side metal sleeve 41 and yoke 54, and radiator fins 56 are provided around cylindrical anode 36. Ceramic stem 48 and outer connecting leads 50, 51 are enclosed in a closed box 58 this closed box also contains filter conductors 59. Outer connecting leads 50,51 are connected, via the inductors 59, to a feed through capacitor 60, which together with these inductors constitutes the filter, and to cathode input terminals 61. The structure of the parts of the ceramic stem 48 is shown in Figs. 4 7. In general, this ceramic stem is a cylinder closed at one end. In longitudinal section it forms an inverted U shape. One end face the upper end face in the drawings has an annular groove 71 formed on it. The surface of the stem bounded by the annular groove 71 serves as the semicircular surfaces P to which are brazed the sealing metal plates there are two such surfaces, one on the left and one on the right , while the surface of the stem outside the annular groove 71 serves as a surface Q to which is brazed the metal sleeve. Both these sealing surfaces P and Q are formed so that they are positioned on the same plane, at right angles to the central axis. On the other side the underside of the ceramic stem, an air side recess 49 is formed, with a large central area hollowed out in the axial direction. Two through holes 67, 68 are provided in the stem and two recesses 69, 70 of a prescribed depth, for taking the ends of the cathode support rods, are provided in diagonally opposed positions adjacent to through holes 67, 68. A groove 72 is formed across the end face of the stem which separates one through hole 67 and its associated recess 69 for taking the end of one support rod from the other through hole 68 and its associated recess 70 for taking the end of the other support rod. Next, using the ceramic stem formed in this way, a molybdenum manganese paste is applied over the whole of the metal plate sealing surfaces P and the metal sleeve sealing surface Q, which are positioned on the same plane, as shown in Fig. 8. Taking advantage of the fact that the sealing surfaces P and Q are on the same plane, and that there are no projections or obstacles of any kind between these sealing surfaces, the paste can be applied, for example, by the screen process. After the paste has dried, the stem is placed in a furnace filled with an inert gas and heated to a temperature of about 1400 Next, sealing metal plates 65, 66 and metal sleeve 47 are hermetically brazed with silver solder to the corresponding sealing surfaces P and Q, as illustrated in Figs 2 and 3. The outer connecting leads 50, 51, of a metal such as copper or iron, are passed through the stem and inserted into the holes formed in sealing plates 65, 66, and hermetically sealed by brazing at the holes. These leads extend through holes 67, 68, beyond recess 49, to permit external connections to be made. The ends of cathode support rods 25, 26 are likewise fitted into the adjacent holes formed in two sealing metal plates 65, 66, and bonded by brazing the bottom ends of these rods, which extend below the sealing metal plates, engage in recesses 69, 70 of a prescribed depth formed in the stem, the rods being stabilized mechanically, and their position fixed, by this means. The materials used for these sealing metal plates 65, 66 are metals such as Kovar trade name or Fe Ni Cr alloys, which have a similar thermal expansion coefficient to that of the ceramic stem, and which are easy to braze via metallized layer 73. Thus cathode support rods, 25, 26 and outer connecting leads 50, 51 are connected electrically via sealing metal plates 65, 66. The joints between cathode support rods 25, 26 and sealing metal plates 65, 66 provide electrical connections only, and play no part in the hermetic sealing of the ceramic stem, while the joints between the sealing metal plates and the outer connecting leads are hermetically sealed at the through holes of the stem. The open end of metal sleeve 47 which forms part of the evacuated envelope is joined, also by brazing, to metallized layer 74 at the circumference of the surface of the ceramic stem. Annular groove 71, on the inner end face of the stem, which is within the evacuated region of the tube, is formed in such a way that the creepage distance and clearance are sufficient to provide electrical isolation between the sealing plates, which are made at the same potential as the cathode, and the metal sleeve, which is made at the same potential as the anode structure, at the high voltage that is applied during the working of the magnetron. As these isolation distance are within a vacuum, it is sufficient for them to be relatively short. Furthermore, diametral groove 72 guarantees the electrical isolation from each other of the two sealing metal plates to which the filament heating voltage is applied. Again, central recess 49 on the air side is so formed that the creepage distance is sufficient to provide electrical isolation in the air, at the high voltage that is applied, between the anode structure, including the metal sleeve, and the outer connecting leads. In an embodiment of the invention, the molybdenum cathode support rods can be shortened, since it is sufficient for them to extend from the end caps to the inside of the ceramic stem and the cost of these parts can thereby be reduced. Further, since the brazing of the cathode support rods to the sealing metal plates has no direct connection with the hermetic seal, there is no need to apply Ni plating or the like to the surface of the cathode support rods. Also, since the vacuum hermetic seal is obtained by brazing between the sealing metal plates and outer connecting leads and the metallized layer on the ceramic stem, materials with are easy to braze to ceramic can be used for the sealing metal plates, and a hermetic seal of a high degree of reliability is obtained. Moreover, since the heat conducted from the cathode and passing down the molybdenum cathode support rods does not pass directly into the parts where the ceramic and the sealing metal plates are hermetically brazed, in this respect also the risk of any failure of the hermetic seal is reduced. Again, even when an outside force is applied to the outer connecting leads, this force will not impinge directly upon the cathode, so that there is little risk of the cathode being deformed or broken. Further, since the brazed surfaces of the ceramic stem are positioned on the same plane, the metallized layers can be formed in a single process, which simplifies manufacture. The embodiment depicted in Figs. 9 and 10 has a ceramic stem 48 shaped like a thick disc. Sealing metal plates 65, 66, each having two integrally formed adjacent eyelets 65a 65b, 66a, 66b, are brazed to the cathode side i.e., the evacuated region side of the ceramic stem the cathode support rods 25, 26 and outer connecting leads 50, 51 are brazed to these eyelets. The metal sleeve 47 is hermetically brazed at the circumference of the surface of the stem on the same plane as these seals. Since cathode support rods 25, 26 not only fit tightly into the eyelets of the sealing metal plates, but have their bottom ends fitted into recesses 69, 70 in the stem, a further degree of mechanical stability and of accuracy in their positioning is obtained. As the outer connecting leads also are inserted into separate eyelets and brazed to them, an even more reliable hermetic seal is achieved. Moreover, although in the embodiments described above, the provision made in the structure for joining the sealing metal plates to the outer connecting leads consists of holes or eyelets with holes, formed in or on the sealing metal plates, into which the ends of the outer connecting leads are inserted, and then brazed to achieve hermetic sealing, the structure need not be limited to this arrangement. The outer connecting leads may, for example, be hermetically brazed to the surface of the ceramic stem at the upper rims of the through holes, without any holes being formed in the sealing metal plates to take these leads, which are then connected electrically by brazing or welding to the stem through hole side of the sealing metal plates. If this structure is adopted, the connection between the sealing metal plates and the outer connecting leads plays no part in the achievement of a hermetic seal, and reliability is further increased thereby. In this case, recesses can be formed in the sealing metal plates from the air side, and the outer connecting leads can then be connected by inserting them into these recesses. Figs. 11 and 12 show another embodiment of the invention. If the parts where the sealing metal plates and the metal sleeve are hermetically brazed to the ceramic stem are positioned substantially on the same plane, the clearance between the two brazed parts is reduced, and also, since the edges of these brazed parts form a rough surface, electrical discharge is more likely to occur between the two. In a microwave oven, in particular, when the power is switched on without any preheating of the filament cathode, an abnormally high voltage is applied to the magnetron, and electrical discharge is likely to occur between the above mentioned two brazed parts. Also, the phenomenon may occur whereby some of the electrons emitted from the filament cathode pass through the gap between the end caps and the pole pieces to reach the ceramic stem in the form of stray electrons. These stray electrons bombard the inner surface of the annular groove in the ceramic stem, causing secondary electrons to be emitted from the ceramic and electrically charging this ceramic surface. This can result in an electrical discharge being produced between the charged surface of the ceramic groove and the sealing metal plates or the part where they are brazed. To prevent these kinds of electrical discharge from occurring within the tube, the structure of the embodiment depicted in Figs. 11 and 12 is desirable. In this embodiment, the outer edges 65c, 66c of the sealing metal plates 65, 66 which are brazed to the inner side of the ceramic stem 48 are extended over the annular groove 71. The present inventors confirmed, by varying the ratio G of the length of the extension e from the brazed part 73 out over the groove to the dimension width d of the annular groove 71 in the radial direction G e d , the existence of a relation between it and the rate of electrical discharge within the tube. The results they obtained are shown in Fig. 13. The horizontal axis of the graph represents the ratio G of the extension of the sealing metal plates to the dimension width of the groove the vertical axis, the electrical discharge rate. This electrical discharge rate is the percentage of occasions on which an electrical discharge occurred when microwave ovens fitted with various test magnetrons were each switched ON OFF 20 times, with no preheating of the filament cathode. As is clear from the line S joining the test points indicated by X, electrical discharge in the vicinity of the annular groove in the stem could be prevented with virtual certainty with an extension ratio G of approximately 50 70 . It is desirable, therefore, that the outer edges 65c, 66c of the sealing metal plates should be extended to about the middle of the annular groove. Moreover, in this embodiment, the through holes 67, 68 are each progressively elongated outwards in the lowest part of the ceramic stem so that they emerge as slots at the lower end face of the stem the ends 50a, 51a of the outer connecting leads 50, 51 are bent outwards to the shape of an inverted V, following the shape of the outer walls so that they emerge from the lower end face of the ceramic stem at the outer ends of the slots. This ensures that no undesired rotation of the leads occurs during assembly. A lead 59a from an inductor 59 is wound round the end of each outer connecting lead and welded to it, forming an electrical connection. In the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 14, the construction is such that the brazed part 74 where the metal sleeve is brazed to the stem is displaced, in relation to the hermetically brazed parts 73 of the sealing metal plates 65, 66, by a small amount h in the axial direction of the tube, towards the bottom of the annular groove. 71. As the amount h of this displacement is not more than 1 mm, the application of the metallized layer to the surfaces to be brazed can be effected at one and the same time in a single process, this case being equivalent to that when the two surfaces to be brazed are substantially on the same plane. A shield ring 75, made of electrically conductive material, for preventing electrical discharge, is fixed by brazing to the brazed part 74 provided for brazing the metal sleeve 47. The inner flange of this shield ring 75 extends about midway over the annular groove 71. Alternatively, even if the two surfaces are on the same plane, the shield ring 75 may be fixed, and in case that the amount h of the displacement is 1 mm or more, desirably 1 mm to 3 mm, the ring cannot be necessarily needed according to circumstances. By this means, electrical discharge in the vicinity of the annular groove is prevented. In the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 15, a shield ring 76 having a short tubular part is fixed to the inside of the metal sleeve 47, and a similar effect to the above, namely the prevention of electrical discharge, is obtained by inserting the end of this short tubular part of the shield ring 76 into the annular groove 71. In the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 16, a buckled shield part 47a is formed by buckling the wall of the metal sleeve 47 inward near its lower end to produce an internal ripple. The size of this buckled shield part 47a is such that it occludes the annular groove 71. Also, the outer edges of the sealing metal plates 65, 66 project slightly over the groove 71. Electrical discharge is prevented by this means. Other variations can be made in the structure for achieving a similar effect, i.e., the prevention of electrical discharge. As explained above, this invention provides the magnetron with a ceramic stem having a cathode support structure that sealing metal plates are hermetically sealed on to the cathode side end face of the ceramic stem, i.e., on to the surface of the stem which faces the evacuated region outer connecting leads are inserted through holes formed in the stem, and these leads are connected electrically to the sealing metal plates and cathode support rods are fixed to part of a sealing plate in each case, these cathode support rods and the outer connecting leads being connected electrically via the sealing metal plates. With this structure, the cathode support rods need only be of a length corresponding approximately to the distance from the cathode to the inner end face of the ceramic stem, i.e., that side facing the cathode with the result that the cost of these parts is reduced. Further, the fact that the cathode support rods can be shortened means that they are more resistant to vibration, and the risk of the filament breaking is thereby reduced. Again, since the heat conducted from the cathode is not transmitted directly to the outer connecting leads, overheating of the hermetic seals between the ceramic stem and the sealing metal plates is minimized, so that the hermetic sealing is highly reliable. Furthermore, if the hermetic seals of the ceramic stem and the sealing metal plates and that of the ceramic stem and the metal sleeve are positioned on the same plane, formation of the metallized layer for the brazing in each case can be carried out in a single process, which not only facilitates assembly but also makes it possible to automate the process, and thereby facilitates the potentiality for mass production of magnetrons for use in microwave ovens.
